same  third  party  can  be  classiﬁed  diﬀerently  depending  on 
the context.  (Section 4). 
Further,  if  we  use  the  deﬁnition  of  tracking  based  on 
tracking-protection lists, as deﬁned in Section 4, then track­
ers are even less prevalent.  This is clear from Figure 2, which 
shows the prevalence of the top third parties (a) in any con­
text and (b) only in tracking contexts.  Note the absence or 
reduction  of  content-delivery  domains  such  as  gstatic.com, 
fbcdn.net, and googleusercontent.com. 
We  can  expand  on  this  by  analyzing  the  top  third-party 
organizations,  many  of  which  consist  of  multiple  entities. 
As  an  example,  Facebook  and  Liverail  are  separate  entities 
but  Liverail  is  owned  by  Facebook.  We  use  the  domain-to­
organization  mappings  provided  by  Libert  [31]  and  Discon­
nect[11].  As shown in Figure 3, Google, Facebook, Twitter, 
Amazon,  AdNexus,  and  Oracle  are  the  third-party  organi­
zations  present  on  more  than  10%  of  sites.  In  comparison 
to  Libert’s  [31]  2014  ﬁndings,  Akamai  and  ComScore  fall 
signiﬁcantly in market share to just 2.4% and 6.6% of sites. 
Oracle joins the top third parties by purchasing BlueKai and 
AddThis,  showing  that  acquisitions  can  quickly  change  the 
tracking landscape. 
Figure  3:  Organizations  with  the  highest  third-party  pres­
ence on the top 1 million sites.  Not all third parties are clas­
siﬁed  as  trackers,  and  in  fact  the  same  third  party  can  be 
classiﬁed diﬀerently depending on the context.  (Section 4). 
Larger entities may be easier to regulate by public-relations 
pressure and the possibility of legal or enforcement actions, 
an outcome we have seen in past studies [1, 6, 34].

In  Section  5.1  we  ranked  third  parties  by  the  number  of 
ﬁrst party sites they appear on.  This simple count is a good 
ﬁrst approximation, but it has two related drawbacks.  A ma­
jor third party that’s present on (say) 90 of the top 100 sites 
would have a low score if its prevalence drops oﬀ outside the 
top 100 sites.  A related problem is that the rank can be sen­
sitive to the number of websites visited in the measurement. 
Thus diﬀerent studies may rank third parties diﬀerently. 
We  also  lack  a  good  way  to  compare  third  parties  (and 
especially  trackers)  over  time,  both  individually  and  in  ag­
gregate.  Some  studies  have  measured  the  total  number  of 
cookies  [4],  but  we  argue  that  this  is  a  misleading  metric, 
since cookies may not have anything to do with tracking. 
To  avoid  these  problems,  we  propose  a  principled  met­
ric.  We start from a model of aggregate browsing behavior. 
There is some research suggesting that the website traﬃc fol­
lows  a  power  law  distribution,  with  the  frequency  of  visits 
to  the  N th  ranked  website  being  proportional  to  N  [3,  22]. 
The  exact  relationship  is  not  important  to  us;  any  formula 
for traﬃc can be plugged into our prominence metric below. 
1
Deﬁnition:. 
Prominence(t) = Σedge(s,t)=1 rank(s) 
1 
where  edge(s, t)  indicates  whether  third  party  t  is  present 
on site s.  This simple formula measures the frequency with 
which an “average” user browsing according to the power-law 
model will encounter any given third party. 
The  most  important  property  of  prominence  is  that  it 
de-emphasizes  obscure  sites,  and  hence  can  be  adequately 
approximated by relatively small-scale measurements, as shown 
in Figure 4.  We propose that prominence is the right metric 
for: 
1.	 Comparing  third  parties  and  identifying  the  top  third 
parties.  We present the list of top third parties by promi­
nence  in  Table  14  in  the  Appendix.  Prominence  rank­
ing  produces  interesting  diﬀerences  compared  to  rank­
ing by a simple prevalence count.  For example, Content-
Distribution  Networks  become  less  prominent  compared 
to other types of third parties. 
2.	 Comparing  third  parties  and  identifying  the  top  third 
parties.  We present the list of top third parties by promi­
nence in the full version of this paper.  Prominence rank­
ing  produces  interesting  diﬀerences  compared  to  rank­
ing by a simple prevalence count.  For example, Content-
Distribution  Networks  become  less  prominent  compared 
to other types of third parties. 
3.	 Measuring  the  eﬀect  of  tracking-protection  tools,  as  we 
do in Section 5.5. 
4.	 Analyzing  the  evolution  of  the  tracking  ecosystem  over 
time  and  comparing  between  studies.  The  robustness  of 
the  rank-prominence  curve  (Figure  4)  makes  it  ideally 
suited for these purposes. 
5.3  Third parties impede HTTPS adoption 
Table  3  shows  the  number  of  ﬁrst-party  sites  that  sup­
port  HTTPS  and  the  number  that  are  HTTPS-only.  Our 
results reveal that HTTPS adoption remains rather low de­
spite  well-publicized  eﬀorts  [13].  Publishers  have  claimed 
that  a  major  roadblock  to  adoption  is  the  need  to  move 
all embedded third parties and trackers to HTTPS to avoid 
mixed-content errors [57, 64]. 
Mixed-content errors occur when HTTP sub-resources are 
Figure 4:  Prominence of third party as a function of promi­
nence  rank.  We  posit  that  the  curve  for  the  1M-site  mea­
surement  (which  can  be  approximated  by  a  50k-site  mea­
surement) presents a useful aggregate picture of tracking.

loaded on a secure site.  This poses a security problem, lead­
ing  to  browsers  to  block  the  resource  load  or  warn  the  user 
depending  on  the  content  loaded  [38].  Passive  mixed  con­
tent,  that  is,  non-executable  resources  loaded  over  HTTP, 
cause the browser to display an insecure warning to the user 
but  still  load  the  content.  Active  mixed  content  is  a  far 
more  serious  security  vulnerability  and  is  blocked  outright 
by modern browsers; it is not reﬂected in our measurements. 
Third-party support for HTTPS. To test the hypoth­
esis  that  third  parties  impede  HTTPS  adoption,  we  ﬁrst 
characterize  the  HTTPS  support  of  each  third  party.  If  a 
third  party  appears  on  at  least  10  sites  and  is  loaded  over 
HTTPS  on  all  of  them,  we  say  that  it  is  HTTPS-only.  If 
it  is  loaded  over  HTTPS  on  some  but  not  all  of  the  sites, 
we  say  that  it  supports  HTTPS.  If  it  is  loaded  over  HTTP 
on  all  of  them,  we  say  that  it  is  HTTP-only.  If  it  appears 
on  less  than  10  sites,  we  do  not  have  enough  conﬁdence  to 
make a determination. 
Table  4  summarizes  the  HTTPS  support  of  third  party 
domains.  A large number of third-party domains are HTTP-
only  (54%).  However,  when  we  weight  third  parties  by 
prominence,  only  5%  are  HTTP-only.  In  contrast,  94%  of 
prominence-weighted third parties support both HTTP and 
HTTPS.  This  supports  our  thesis  that  consolidation  of  the 
third-party ecosystem is a plus for security and privacy.

fraction of HTTP-default sites (26%) embed resources from 
third-parties which do not support HTTPS. These sites would 
be  unable  to  upgrade  to  HTTPS  without  browsers  display­
ing mixed content errors to their users, the majority of which 
(92%) would contain active content which would be blocked. 
Similarly, of the approximately 78,000 ﬁrst-party sites that 
are HTTPS-only, around 6,000 (7.75%) load with mixed pas­
sive content warnings.  However, only 11% of these warnings 
(around  650)  are  caused  by  HTTP-only  third  parties,  sug­
gesting  that  many  domains  may  be  able  to  mitigate  these 
warnings  by  ensuring  all  resources  are  being  loaded  over 
HTTPS  when  available.  We  examined  the  causes  of  mixed 
content  on  these  sites,  summarized  in  Table  5.  The  major­
ity  are  caused  by  third  parties,  rather  than  the  site’s  own 
content, with a surprising 27% caused solely by trackers. 
5.4  News sites have the most trackers 
The  level  of  tracking  on  diﬀerent  categories  of  websites 
varies considerably — by almost an order of magnitude.  To 
measure variation across categories, we used Alexa’s lists of 
top  500  sites  in  each  of  16  categories.  From  each  list  we 
sampled 100 sites (the lists contain some URLs that are not 
home pages, and we excluded those before sampling). 
In  Figure  6  we  show  the  average  number  of  third  parties 
loaded  across  100  of  the  top  sites  in  each  Alexa  category. 
Third  parties  are  classiﬁed  as  trackers  if  they  would  have 
been  blocked  by  one  of  the  tracking  protection  lists  (Sec­
tion 4). 
Why  is  there  so  much  variation?  With  the  exception  of 
the adult category, the sites on the low end of the spectrum 
are  mostly  sites  which  belong  to  government  organizations, 
universities, and non-proﬁt entities.  This suggests that web­
sites may be able to forgo advertising and tracking due to the 
presence of funding sources external to the web.  Sites on the 
high end of the spectrum are largely those which provide ed­
itorial content.  Since many of these sites provide articles for 
Figure 6:  Average # of third parties in each Alexa category. 
free, and lack an external funding source, they are pressured 
to monetize page views with signiﬁcantly more advertising. 
5.5  Does tracking protection work? 
Users  have  two  main  ways  to  reduce  their  exposure  to 
tracking:  the  browser’s  built  in  privacy  features  and  exten­
sions such as Ghostery or uBlock Origin. 
Contrary  to  previous  work  questioning  the  eﬀectiveness 
of  Firefox’s  third-party  cookie  blocking  [14],  we  do  ﬁnd  the 
feature  to  be  eﬀective.  Speciﬁcally,  only  237  sites  (0.4%) 
have  any  third-party  cookies  set  during  our  measurement 
set  to  block  all  third-party  cookies  (“Block  TP  Cookies” in 
Table 2).  Most of these are for benign reasons, such as redi­
recting to the U.S. version of a non-U.S. site.  We did ﬁnd ex­
ceptions, including 32 that contained ID cookies.  For exam­
ple, there are six Australian news sites that ﬁrst redirect to 
news.com.au before re-directing back to the initial domain, 
which seems to be for tracking purposes.  While this type of 
workaround  to  third-party  cookie  blocking  is  not  rampant, 
we  suggest  that  browser  vendors  should  closely  monitor  it 
and make changes to the blocking heuristic if necessary.
