### Third-Party Classification and Tracking Prevalence

The classification of a third party can vary based on the context (Section 4). If we use the definition of tracking based on tracking-protection lists, as defined in Section 4, trackers are even less prevalent. This is evident from Figure 2, which illustrates the prevalence of the top third parties in any context (a) and only in tracking contexts (b). Note the absence or reduction of content-delivery domains such as gstatic.com, fbcdn.net, and googleusercontent.com.

### Analysis of Top Third-Party Organizations

We can further analyze the top third-party organizations, many of which consist of multiple entities. For example, Facebook and Liverail are separate entities, but Liverail is owned by Facebook. We use domain-to-organization mappings provided by Libert [31] and Disconnect [11]. As shown in Figure 3, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, AdNexus, and Oracle are the third-party organizations present on more than 10% of sites. Compared to Libert’s [31] 2014 findings, Akamai and ComScore have significantly reduced their market share to just 2.4% and 6.6% of sites, respectively. Oracle has joined the top third parties by acquiring BlueKai and AddThis, demonstrating that acquisitions can quickly change the tracking landscape.

**Figure 3: Organizations with the highest third-party presence on the top 1 million sites.**  
Not all third parties are classified as trackers, and the same third party can be classified differently depending on the context (Section 4).

Larger entities may be easier to regulate through public-relations pressure and the possibility of legal or enforcement actions, as observed in past studies [1, 6, 34].

### Prominence: A Third-Party Ranking Metric

In Section 5.1, we ranked third parties by the number of first-party sites they appear on. While this simple count is a good initial approximation, it has two related drawbacks. A major third party present on, say, 90 of the top 100 sites would have a low score if its prevalence drops outside the top 100 sites. Additionally, the rank can be sensitive to the number of websites visited in the measurement, leading to different rankings in different studies.

We also lack a robust way to compare third parties (and especially trackers) over time, both individually and in aggregate. Some studies have measured the total number of cookies [4], but this metric can be misleading since cookies may not be related to tracking.

To address these issues, we propose a principled metric called **Prominence**. We start from a model of aggregate browsing behavior, where website traffic follows a power-law distribution. The frequency of visits to the Nth-ranked website is proportional to 1/N [3, 22]. The exact relationship is not crucial; any traffic formula can be used in our prominence metric.

**Definition:**
\[ \text{Prominence}(t) = \sum_{\text{edge}(s, t) = 1} \frac{1}{\text{rank}(s)} \]
where edge(s, t) indicates whether third party t is present on site s. This formula measures the frequency with which an "average" user, browsing according to the power-law model, will encounter any given third party.

The most important property of prominence is that it de-emphasizes obscure sites, making it possible to approximate with relatively small-scale measurements, as shown in Figure 4. We propose that prominence is the right metric for:

1. **Comparing third parties and identifying the top third parties.** The list of top third parties by prominence is presented in Table 14 in the Appendix. Prominence ranking produces interesting differences compared to ranking by a simple prevalence count. For example, Content-Distribution Networks become less prominent compared to other types of third parties.
2. **Measuring the effect of tracking-protection tools.** This is discussed in Section 5.5.
3. **Analyzing the evolution of the tracking ecosystem over time and comparing between studies.** The robustness of the rank-prominence curve (Figure 4) makes it ideally suited for these purposes.

**Figure 4: Prominence of third parties as a function of prominence rank.**  
We posit that the curve for the 1M-site measurement (which can be approximated by a 50k-site measurement) presents a useful aggregate picture of tracking.

### Third Parties and HTTPS Adoption

Table 3 shows the number of first-party sites that support HTTPS and those that are HTTPS-only. Despite well-publicized efforts [13], HTTPS adoption remains low. Publishers claim that a major roadblock to adoption is the need to move all embedded third parties and trackers to HTTPS to avoid mixed-content errors [57, 64].

Mixed-content errors occur when HTTP sub-resources are loaded on a secure site, posing a security problem. Browsers either block the resource load or warn the user, depending on the content. Passive mixed content, i.e., non-executable resources loaded over HTTP, causes the browser to display an insecure warning but still loads the content. Active mixed content, a more serious security vulnerability, is blocked outright by modern browsers.

**Third-Party Support for HTTPS:**
To test the hypothesis that third parties impede HTTPS adoption, we characterized the HTTPS support of each third party. If a third party appears on at least 10 sites and is loaded over HTTPS on all of them, it is classified as HTTPS-only. If it is loaded over HTTPS on some but not all sites, it supports HTTPS. If it is loaded over HTTP on all sites, it is HTTP-only. If it appears on fewer than 10 sites, we do not have enough confidence to make a determination.

**Table 4: Third-party HTTPS support.**
- **HTTP Only:** 54%
- **HTTPS Only:** 5%
- **Both:** 41%

When weighted by prominence:
- **HTTP Only:** 5%
- **HTTPS Only:** 1%
- **Both:** 94%

This supports our thesis that consolidation of the third-party ecosystem is beneficial for security and privacy.

**Impact of Third-Parties:**
A significant fraction of HTTP-default sites (26%) embed resources from third parties that do not support HTTPS. These sites would be unable to upgrade to HTTPS without browsers displaying mixed-content errors to users, with 92% containing active content that would be blocked. Of the approximately 78,000 first-party sites that are HTTPS-only, around 6,000 (7.75%) load with mixed passive content warnings. However, only 11% of these warnings (around 650) are caused by HTTP-only third parties, suggesting that many domains could mitigate these warnings by ensuring all resources are loaded over HTTPS when available.

**Table 5: Breakdown of causes of passive mixed-content warnings.**
- **Top 1M Sites:**
  - Own Favicon: 25.4%
  - Tracking: 10.4%
  - CDN: 1.6%
  - Non-tracking: 44.9%
  - Multiple Causes: 15.6%
- **Top 55k Sites:**
  - Own Favicon: 24.9%
  - Tracking: 20.1%
  - CDN: 2.6%
  - Non-tracking: 35.4%
  - Multiple Causes: 6.3%

### News Sites Have the Most Trackers

The level of tracking varies considerably across different categories of websites, by almost an order of magnitude. To measure variation across categories, we used Alexa’s lists of the top 500 sites in each of 16 categories, sampling 100 sites from each list (excluding non-homepage URLs).

**Figure 6: Average number of third parties in each Alexa category.**

Sites on the low end of the spectrum, except for the adult category, are mostly government, university, and non-profit entities, suggesting that these websites can forgo advertising and tracking due to external funding sources. Sites on the high end, largely editorial content providers, are pressured to monetize page views with more advertising because they often provide articles for free and lack external funding.

### Does Tracking Protection Work?

Users can reduce their exposure to tracking through the browser's built-in privacy features and extensions like Ghostery or uBlock Origin. Contrary to previous work questioning the effectiveness of Firefox’s third-party cookie blocking [14], we find the feature to be effective. Specifically, only 237 sites (0.4%) had any third-party cookies set during our measurement with the setting to block all third-party cookies ("Block TP Cookies" in Table 2). Most of these were for benign reasons, such as redirecting to the U.S. version of a non-U.S. site. We did find exceptions, including 32 that contained ID cookies. For example, six Australian news sites first redirect to news.com.au before re-directing back to the initial domain, likely for tracking purposes. While this type of workaround is not rampant, browser vendors should closely monitor it and adjust the blocking heuristic if necessary.
