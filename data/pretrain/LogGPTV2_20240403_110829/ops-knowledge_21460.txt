User: How to optimize the performance of the Linux system, including tuning kernel parameters, optimizing the file system, optimizing the network, etc.?
Assistant: Linux system performance optimization involves many aspects, including tuning kernel parameters, optimizing file systems, and optimizing networks. The following are some common optimization methods: 1. Tuning kernel parameters Linux system kernel parameters can be modified to optimize system performance. Some of the important parameters include: - vm.swappiness: Control system memory usage, the smaller the value, the more inclined to use physical memory, and the larger the value, the more inclined to use the swap partition. - vm.dirty_background_ratio and vm.dirty_ratio: Control the memory cache write time and size of the file system. - net.core.somaxconn: Controls the maximum length of the socket queue. - net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets: Controls the maximum number of TIME-WAIT states in the TCP connection state table. - net.core.netdev_max_backlog: Controls the maximum buffer length of packets received by network devices. 2. Optimize the file system The file system is a key factor in system performance. The following optimizations can be made: - Use a high-performance file system such as XFS or ext4. - Adjust the IO scheduler in the file system, such as using the deadline scheduler. - Write the filesystem to the SSD. 3. Optimize the network Network performance is the bottleneck of many applications. The following optimizations can be performed: - Adjust TCP parameters, such as modifying the TCP window size. - Enable flow control and congestion control algorithms. - Use high-performance network transport protocols such as RDMA. 4. Use performance analysis tools You can use some tools to analyze system performance, such as top, vmstat, sar, strace, etc. These tools can help identify system bottlenecks, and then take appropriate optimization measures. 5. Disable unnecessary services and processes Disabling unnecessary services and processes can release system resources and improve system performance. A service can be disabled using the command systemctl disable.
