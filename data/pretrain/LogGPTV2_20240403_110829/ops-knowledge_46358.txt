User: In a tornado request handler if I have to call function foo() which doesn't affect what's returned to the user, it makes sense to return result to the user first and then call foo(). Is it possible to do this easily in tornado (or with some third-party package)?
Assistant: ioloop.add_callback, Tornado will execute the callback in the next IOLoop iteration.
