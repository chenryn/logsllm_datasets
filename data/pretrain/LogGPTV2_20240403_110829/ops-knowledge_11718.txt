User: So I have a lot of python scripts that I have written for my work but no one in my lab knows how to use Python so I wanted to be able to generate a simple Mac App where you can 'Browse' for a file on your computer and type in the name of the file that you want to save . . . everything else will be processed by the application for the python script I have generated.  
Does anyone know if this is possible? I watched some tutorials on people generating applications in Xcode with Objective C but I don't want to have to learn a new language to reconstruct my Python scripts.
Thank you
Assistant: Open Automator
Choose "Application"
Drag a "Run Shell Script" onto the workflow panel
Choose "/usr/bin/python" as the shell. Paste in your script, and select Pass Input: "to stdin"
Or, choose bash as the shell, and simply have the automator script run your Python script with Pass Input "as arguments" selected on the top right. You'll then use the contents of $@ as your arguments.
Save the application. 
Done. You have a .app onto which files can be dragged.
