### Issue: `getDerivedStateFromProps` is Invoked After State Change in the Same Component

**CodeSandbox Example:** [Link](https://codesandbox.io/s/8k1v8xjq68)

In the provided example, you can observe that `ElementOne` clears its state after a state change within the same component. This occurs because the static method `getDerivedStateFromProps` is invoked. According to the React documentation, `getDerivedStateFromProps` is called after a component is instantiated and whenever it receives new props. In this case, `ElementOne` appears to be receiving new state, which triggers the `getDerivedStateFromProps` method.

On the other hand, `ElementTwo` uses the `componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle method, and its behavior is as expected.

**React Version:**
- `react`: 16.4
- `react-dom`: 16.4
