**bug - getDerivedStateFromProps is invoked after change state in the same
component**
CodeSandbox ( https://codesandbox.io/s/8k1v8xjq68 )  
In my example you can see, that the ElementOne clear state after change state
in this component, because the static function getDerivedStateFromProps is
invoked (In the guide is: The static getDerivedStateFromProps lifecycle is
invoked after a component is instantiated as well as when it **receives new
props**. -> ElementOne received new state.). ElementTwo is same with component
willReceiveProps, but this behavior is ok.
