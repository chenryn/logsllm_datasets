User: I am trying to make my python script executable without going through the terminal typing like
python test.py
I want to make it able to run when i click on the file.
How i going to do this in my fedora machine.
Assistant: If you don't have any specific version requirement then using first line as #!/usr/bin/env python will be more efficient and give the execute permission chmod u+x test.py
