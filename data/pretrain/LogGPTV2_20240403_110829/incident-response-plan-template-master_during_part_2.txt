Impact               | ... break things              | What systems or data? How? When? Where? How bad?
See the [MITRE ATT&CK page](https://attack.mitre.org/) for more insight and ideas.
## Create and Deploy Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
> Emphasize **dynamic and behavioral** indicators alongside static fingerprints.
* Create IOCs based on [initial leads](#collect-initial-leads) and [analysis](#analyze-evidence).
* Create IOCs using an open format supported by your tools (_e.g._, [STIX 2.0](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro)), if possible. `TODO: Customize IOC format as necessary.`
* Use automation, if possible. `TODO: Add IOC deployment/revocation procedure.`
* **Do not** deploy unrelated, un-curated "feeds" of IOCs; these can cause confusion and fatigue.
* Consider all IOC types:
  * Network-based IOCs such as IP or MAC addresses, ports, email addresses, email content or metadata, URLs, domains, or PCAP patterns.
  * Host-based IOCs such as paths, file hashes, file content or metadata, registry keys, MUTEXes, autoruns, or user artifacts and permissions.
  * Cloud-based IOCs such as log patterns for [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) or [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service) deployments
  * Behavioral IOCs (a.k.a., patterns, TTPs) such as process tree patterns, heuristics, deviation from baseline, and login patterns.
* Correlate various IOC types, such as network and host-based indicators on the same systems(s).
## Identify Systems of Interest
1. Validate whether they are relevant.
1. Categorize the reason(s) they are "of interest": has malware, accessed by compromised account, has sensitive data, etc.  Treat these as "tags", there may be more than one category per system.
1. Prioritize collection, analysis, and remediation based on investigative needs, business impact, _etc._
## Collect Evidence
* Prioritize based on the investigative plan
* Collect live response data using {{LIVE_RESPONSE_TOOL}}.  `TODO: Customize live response tools and procedure.`
* Collect relevant logs from system(s) (if not part of live response), aggregator(s), SIEM(s), or device console(s).  `TODO: Customize log collection tools and procedure.`
* Collect memory image, if necessary and if not part of live response, using {{MEMORY_COLLECTION_TOOL}}.  `TODO: Customize memory collection tools and procedure.`
* Collect disk image, if necessary, using {{DISK_IMAGE_TOOL}}.  `TODO: Customize disk image collection tool and procedure.`
* Collect and store evidence in accordance with policy, and with proper chain of custody. `TODO: Customize evidence collection and chain of custody policy.`
Consider collecting the following artifacts as evidence, either in real time (_e.g., via EDR or a SIEM) or on demand:
###  Example Useful Artifacts
`TODO: Customize and prioritize useful artifacts.`
* Running Processes
* Running Services
* Executable Hashes
* Installed Applications
* Local and Domain Users
* Listening Ports and Associated Services
* Domain Name System (DNS) Resolution Settings and Static Routes
* Established and Recent Network Connections
* Run Key and other AutoRun Persistence
* Scheduled tasks and cron jobs
* Artifacts of past execution (e.g., Prefetch and Shimcache)
* Event logs
* Group policy and WMI artifacts
* Anti-virus detections
* Binaries in temporary storage locations
* Remote access credentials
* Network connection telemetry (e.g., netflow, firewall permits)
* DNS traffic and activity
* Remote access activity including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), virtual private network (VPN), SSH, virtual network computing (VNC), and other remote access tools
* Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) strings, user agent strings, and proxy enforcement actions
* Web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS)
## Analyze Evidence
* Prioritize based on the investigative plan
* Analyze and triage live response data
* Analyze memory and disk images (_i.e._, conduct forensics)
* Analyze malware
* _OPTIONAL:_ Enrich with research and intelligence
* Document new indicators of compromise (IOCs)
* Update the case file
### Example Useful Indicators
`TODO: Customize and prioritize useful indicators.`
* Unusual authentication behavior (_e.g._, frequency, systems, time of day, remote location)
* Non-Standard formatted usernames
* Unsigned binaries connecting to the network
* Beaconing or significant data transfers
* PowerShell command line requests with Base64-encoded commands
* Excessive RAR, 7zip, or WinZip activity, especially with suspicious file names
* Connections on previously unused ports.
* Traffic patterns related to time, frequency, and byte count
* Changes to routing tables, such as weighting, static entries, gateways, and peer relationships
## Iterate Investigation
[Update the investigative plan](#update-investigative-plan-and-incident-file) and repeat until closure.
# Remediate
**[Investigate](#investigate), [remediate](#remediate), and [communicate](#communicate) in parallel, using separate teams, if possible.**  The Incident Commander will coordinate these activities.  Notify the Incident Commander if there are steps the team should consider
## Update Remediation Plan
1. Review the incident file at {{INCIDENT_FILE_LOCATION}} using the [incident name](#name-the-incident)
1. Review applicable [playbooks](#playbooks).
1. Review the [Response Resource List](#reference-response-resource-list)).
1. Consider which attacker tactics are in play in this incident.  Use the MITRE [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page) list (_i.e._, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Execution, Collection, Exfiltration, and Command and Control), or similar framework.
1. Develop remediations for each tactic in play, as feasible given existing tools and resources.  Consider remediations to [Protect](#protect), [Detect](#detect), [Contain](#contain), and [Eradicate](#eradicate) each attacker behavior.
1. Prioritize based on [timing strategy](#choose-remediation-timing), impact, and urgency.
1. Document in incident file.
Use [information security (infosec) frameworks](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) as inspiration, but **do not use incident remediation as a substitute for an infosec program with an appropriate framework.**  Use them to supplement one another.
### Protect
> "How can we stop tactic X from happening again, or reduce risk?  How can we improve future protection?"
Use the following as a starting point for protective remediation:
* Patch applications.
* Patch operating systems.
* Update network and host IPS signatures.
* Update endpoint protection/EDR/anti-virus signatures.
* Reduce locations with critical data.
* Reduce administrative or privileged accounts.
* Enable multi-factor authentication.
* Strengthen password requirements.
* Block unused ports and protocols at segment and network boundaries, both inbound and outbound.
* Whitelist network connections for critical servers and services.
### Detect
> "How can we detect this on new systems or in the future?  How can we improve future detection and investigation?"
Use the following as a starting point for detective remediation:
* Enhance logging and retention for system logs, particularly critical systems.
* Enhance logging for applications, including SaaS applications.
* Enhance log aggregation.
* Update network and host IDS signatures using IOCs.
### Contain
> "How can we stop this from spreading, or getting more severe? How can we improve future containment?"
Use the following as a starting point for containment remediation:
* Implement access lists (ACLs) at network segment boundaries
* Implement blocks at the enterprise boundary, at multiple layers of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).
* Disable or remove compromised account access.
* Block malicious IP addresses or networks.
* Black hole or sinkhole malicious domains.
* Update network and host IPS and anti-malware signatures using IOCs.
* Remove critical or compromised systems from the network.
* Contact providers for assistance (_e.g._, internet service providers, SaaS vendors)
* Whitelist network connections for critical servers and services.
* Kill or disable processes or services.
* Block or remove access for external vendors and partners, especially privileged access.
### Eradicate
> "How can we eliminate this from our assets?  How can we improve future eradication?"
Use the following as a starting point for eradication remediation:
* Rebuild or restore compromised systems and data from known-good state.
* Reset account passwords.
* Remove hostile accounts or credentials.
* Delete or remove specific malware (difficult!).
* Implement alternative vendors.
* Activate and migrate to alternate locations, services, or servers.
## Choose Remediation Timing
Determine the timing strategy---when remediation actions will be taken---by engaging the Incident Commander, the system SMEs and owners, business unit SMEs and owners, and the executive team.  Each strategy is appropriate under different circumstances:
* Choose **immediate** remediation when it is more important to immediately stop attacker activities than to continue investigating.  For example, ongoing financial loss, or ongoing mission failure, active data loss, or prevention of an imminent significant threat.
* Choose **delayed** remediation when it is important to complete the investigation, or important not to alert the attacker.  For example, long-term compromise by an advanced attacker, corporate espionage, or large-scale compromise of an an unknown number of systems.
* Choose **combined** remediation when both immediate and delayed circumstances apply in the same incident.  For example, immediate segmentation of a sensitive server or network to meet regulatory requirements while still investigating a long-term compromise.
## Execute Remediation
* Assess and explain risks of remediation actions to stakeholders.  `TODO: Customize remediation risk approval procedure, if necessary.`
* Immediately implement those remediation actions with little or no affect on the attacker (sometimes called "posturing actions").  For example, many of the [protection](#protect) and [detection](#detect) actions above are good candidates.
* Schedule and task remediation actions according to the timing strategy.
* Execute remediation actions in batches, as events, for maximum effectiveness and minimum risk.
* Document execution status and time in the incident file, especially for temporary measures.
## Iterate Remediation
[Update the remediation plan](#update-remediation-plan) and repeat until closure.
# Communicate
**[Investigate](#investigate), [remediate](#remediate), and [communicate](#communicate) in parallel, using separate teams, if possible.**  The Incident Commander will coordinate these activities.  Notify the Incident Commander if there are steps the team should consider
All communication must include the most accurate information available.  Display integrity.  Do not communicate speculation.
## Communicate Internally
### Notify and Update Stakeholders
* Communicate with stakeholders as part of the initial and update calls, as well as via event-driven updates on the call and chat.
* Coordinate independent updates (_e.g._, executive, legal) as required, but as infrequently as practicable, to keep the focus on investigation and remediation.
* Focus on the best assessment of the vector, impact, summary, and highlights of the timeline including remediation steps.  Do not speculate.
### Notify and Update Organization
* **Do not** notify or update non-response personnel until cleared by the Incident Commander, particularly if there is a risk of an insider threat.
* Coordinate updates for teams or the entire organization with executives and business leadership.
* Focus on the best assessment of the vector, impact, summary, and highlights of the timeline including remediation steps.  Do not speculate.
### Create Incident Report
* Upon incident closure, capture information in the [incident file](#create-incident-file) for distribution using the format at {{INCIDENT_REPORT_TEMPLATE}}.  **If the vector, impact, summary, timeline, and activity reports are complete, this can be fully automated.**
* Distribute the incident report to the following: {{INCIDENT_REPORT_RECIPIENTS}}.
* `TODO: Customize incident report creation and distribution, if necessary`
## Communicate Externally
### Notify Regulators
* **Do not** notify or update non-response personnel until cleared by the Incident Commander.
* Notify regulators (_e.g._, HIPAA/HITRUST, PCI DSS, SOX) if necessary, and in accordance with policy.
* Coordinate requirements, format, and timeline with {{COMPLIANCE_TEAM}}.
### Notify Customers
* **Do not** notify or update non-response personnel until cleared by the Incident Commander.
* Coordinate customer notifications with {{COMMUNICATIONS_TEAM}}.
* Include the date in the title of any announcement, to avoid confusion.
* **Do not** use platitudes such as "we take security very seriously". Focus on facts.
* Be honest, accept responsibility, and present the facts, along with the plan to prevent similar incidents in future.
* Be as detailed as possible with the timeline.
* Be as detailed as possible in what information was compromised, and how it affects customers. If we were storing something we shouldn't have been, be honest about it. It'll come out later and it'll be much worse.
* **Do not** discuss external parties that might have caused the compromise, unless they've already publicly disclosed, in which case link to their disclosure.  Communicate with them independently (see [Notify Vendors](#notify-vendors-and-partners))
* Release the external communication as soon as possible.  Bad news does not get better with age.
* If possible, contact customers' internal security teams before notifying the public.
### Notify Vendors and Partners
* **Do not** notify or update non-response personnel until cleared by the Incident Commander.
* If possible, contact vendors' and partners' internal security teams before notifying the public.
* Focus on the specific aspects of the incident that affect or implicate the vendor or partner.
* Coordinate response efforts and share information if possible.
### Notify Law Enforcement
* **Do not** notify or update non-response personnel until cleared by the Incident Commander.
* Coordinate with {{EXECUTIVE_TEAM}} and {{LEGAL_TEAM}} prior to interacting with law enforcement
* Contact local law enforcement at {{LOCAL_LE_CONTACT}}.
* Contact FBI at {{FBI_CONTACT}} or via the [Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)](https://www.ic3.gov).

* Share IOCs with your servicing [ISAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Sharing_and_Analysis_Center) through {{ISAC_CONTACT}}, if applicable.
# Recover
`TODO: Customize recovery steps.`
`TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below.`
**Recovery is typically governed by business units and system owners.  Take recovery actions only in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.**
1. Launch business continuity/disaster recovery plan(s): _e.g._, consider migration to alternate operating locations, fail-over sites, backup systems.
1. Integrate security actions with organizational recovery efforts.
