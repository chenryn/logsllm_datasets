Hello. I found an inconsistency between SO (Seaborn Objects) and functional
API.
When having a values sorted descendingly, SO puts the first value (as ordered
in pandas df) to the bottom. This problem occurs only for horizontal bar
chart.

This works differently than in the functional API.

Would it be possible to have the default set as in the functional API with an
option to override it? This default would work better with value_counts, since
people start looking at the plot from the top-left corner, so this is the
place where we want them to show the "most important" category.
