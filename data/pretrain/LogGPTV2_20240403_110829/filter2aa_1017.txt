Solder Alloys You Will Actually Use
What is Flux?
5: a substance used to promote fusion 
(as of metals or minerals) ; 
especially : one (as rosin) applied to 
surfaces to be joined by soldering, 
brazing, or welding to clean and free 
them from oxide and promote their 
union.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flux
3. FluX on: Flux 
• Cleans the surfaces to be joined
• Increases the flow of solder
– Conducts heat to a degree 
• Prevents oxidation during soldering
3. FluX on: Flux 
What does Flux do?
Available forms of Flux
• Liquid
– Rosin, No clean rosin
– Water soluble (Inorganic)
• Paste
– Rosin
– Acid
• Cored Solder
– Rosin, No clean rosin
– Water soluble (Organic & Inorganic)
– Acid
3. FluX on: Flux 
What is Rosin?
1: a translucent amber-colored to 
almost black brittle friable resin that 
is obtained from the oleoresin or 
deadwood of pine trees or from tall 
oil and used especially in making 
varnish
