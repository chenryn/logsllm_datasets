User: According to the following system architecture, a database read-write separation scheme is provided to improve the performance of the database. The system consists of a load balancer, an application server, and a database server. The application server connects to the database server through JDBC to read and write data. The database server is a MySQL database.
Assistant: The scheme of database read-write separation is as follows: 1. Install multiple MySQL database servers, and use some of them for read operations and the other for write operations. 2. Set up two database groups on the load balancer, which are used for read operations and write operations respectively, and read and write operations are forwarded according to the load balancing policy. 3. On the application server, configure the JDBC connection pool, and connect the read and write operations to the read and write database groups respectively. 4. On the database server, set up master-slave replication, synchronize write operations to all slave servers, and read operations from slave servers. 5. Use caching technology, such as Redis, to cache commonly used data in memory to reduce the number of database reads. Through the above solution, the performance of the database can be improved, the burden of the database server can be reduced, and the consistency of the data can be guaranteed at the same time.
