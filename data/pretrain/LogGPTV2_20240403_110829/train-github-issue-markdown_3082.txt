 **Symfony version(s) affected** : 4.1. symfony/workflow: 4.2
**Description**  
Hello. I've faced an issue when I placing two or more values in `from` section
at transitions description in config. As far as I know, this is allowed,
right?
So I'm getting false negative results when trying to apply for state transfer
with allowed `from` values.
**How to reproduce**  
After some research, I believe that the problem is in the following
`buildTransitionBlockerListForTransition` method. The method just iterates all
over places and creates `TransitionBlockerList` on first false condition. But
as far as I get - method have to iterate over all forms and only then create
`TransitionBlockerList` if needed.
Here is the reference on code that I've described above.  
https://github.com/symfony/workflow/blob/master/Workflow.php#L247
**Possible Solution**  
Iterate over all places and create `TransitionBlockerList` only if
`$marking->has($place)` have returned false for every `$place`
