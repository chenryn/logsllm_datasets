### Symfony Version Affected
- Symfony: 4.1
- symfony/workflow: 4.2

### Description
I have encountered an issue when specifying multiple values in the `from` section of a transition configuration. As far as I understand, this should be allowed. However, I am experiencing false negative results when attempting to apply state transitions with valid `from` values.

### How to Reproduce
After some investigation, I believe the problem lies in the `buildTransitionBlockerListForTransition` method. This method iterates over all places and creates a `TransitionBlockerList` on the first false condition. Instead, it should iterate over all `from` values and only create a `TransitionBlockerList` if `$marking->has($place)` returns false for every `$place`.

Here is the reference to the code in question:
- [Workflow.php#L247](https://github.com/symfony/workflow/blob/master/Workflow.php#L247)

### Possible Solution
Modify the `buildTransitionBlockerListForTransition` method to iterate over all `from` values and create a `TransitionBlockerList` only if `$marking->has($place)` returns false for every `$place`.

### Additional Context
Here is my workflow configuration:

```yaml
framework:
    workflows:
        payment:
            type: 'workflow'
            supports:
                - App\Entity\Payment
                - App\Entity\RecurringPayment
            initial_place: new
            marking_store:
                type: 'single_state'
                arguments:
                    - 'status'
            places:
                - new
                - accepted
                - error
                - declined
                - pending
                - refunded
                - cancelled
            transitions:
                pending:
                    from: new
                    to: pending
                accepted:
                    from: [new, pending, accepted]
                    to: accepted
                refunded:
                    from: accepted
                    to: refunded
                cancelled:
                    from: [new, pending, accepted]
                    to: cancelled
                error:
                    from: [new, pending]
                    to: error
                declined:
                    from: [new, pending]
                    to: declined
```
