User: Given a set of data, through Nginx load balancing, how to distribute it to different back-end servers for processing?
Assistant: To achieve Nginx load balancing and distribute data to different back-end servers for processing, the following steps need to be taken: 1. Install and configure Nginx: Install and configure Nginx on all back-end servers to ensure that they can provide services normally. At the same time, define the Upstream cluster in the Nginx configuration file, which is the list of backend servers that will process the request, for example: upstream backend_servers { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; } 2. Configure Nginx's load balancing strategy: Nginx provides a variety of load balancing strategies, including round robin, IP Hash, minimum number of connections, etc., and you can choose an appropriate strategy according to the actual situation. For example, add the following statement to the configuration file of Nginx: # Polling strategy upstream backend_servers { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; # Polling strategy # requests will be distributed one -by-one between the servers in the list # by default # Just add the policy definition below} 3. Configure the reverse proxy function of Nginx: add reverse proxy rules in the host configuration of Nginx to forward the request to the In the upstream cluster of the end server. For example: server { listen 80; server_name frontend.example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend_servers; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } above In the code, the request from frontend.example.com is forwarded to the upstream cluster backend_servers through the reverse proxy rules. The specific forwarding strategy is determined by the configuration in the previous step. At the same time, a proxy header needs to be set so that the backend server can correctly identify information such as the request source and IP address. 4. Start the Nginx service: Start the Nginx service on all backend servers and ensure that the cluster can work normally. Through the above steps, Nginx load balancing can be realized, and requests can be distributed to different backend servers for processing. It should be noted that when adding or deleting backend servers in the Upstream cluster, the Nginx configuration file needs to be reloaded.
