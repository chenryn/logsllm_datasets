User: Please introduce the basic characteristics of cloud native (Cloud Native) applications and their differences from traditional applications.
Assistant: Cloud-native applications have the following basic characteristics: 1. Containerization: Cloud-native applications are usually packaged and deployed using container technology for rapid deployment and migration. 2. Microservice architecture: Cloud-native applications usually adopt a microservice architecture, which splits the application into small, independent service units, thereby improving the scalability, reliability, and maintainability of the application. 3. Automation: Cloud-native applications use automation to implement operations such as management, monitoring, expansion, and failure recovery, thereby speeding up application development, testing, deployment, operation, and maintenance. 4. Cloud-oriented platform: Cloud-native applications are designed and developed for cloud platforms, making full use of technical advantages such as cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence, so as to achieve efficient, convenient and sustainable application development and operation. Compared with traditional applications, cloud-native applications have the following differences: 1. Cloud-native applications adopt containerization and microservice architecture to realize service unitization and lightweight deployment, while traditional applications use monolithic applications and traditional architecture . 2. Cloud-native applications adopt automated operation and maintenance and design for cloud platforms, while traditional applications usually adopt manual management and design for traditional IT infrastructure. 3. Cloud-native applications have higher scalability, reliability, maintainability, and security, resulting in higher application efficiency and user experience, which are often difficult for traditional applications.
