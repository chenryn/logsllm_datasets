User: In order to ensure information security, we usually encrypt some sensitive data. Please provide a scheme suitable for large-scale data encryption.
Assistant: A scheme suitable for large-scale data encryption is to use distributed encryption technology. This technique allows data to be divided into multiple parts, each encrypted by a different key, which is distributed across different servers. When the data needs to be decrypted, all encryption keys need to be collected and the data decrypted locally. The advantage of this approach is that it increases the security of the data, since an attacker needs to have all the keys to decrypt the data. At the same time, because the keys are distributed on different servers, even if a certain server is attacked, it will not affect the security of other data. In distributed encryption technology, hybrid encryption technology can also be used, that is, first use symmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt data, and then use public key encryption algorithm to encrypt the symmetric key. This approach increases encryption speed and security.
