Assistant: Whether there is an exception: No exception Description: This log records a NIOServerCxn event, which is one of the components in the Zookeeper distributed coordination service and is used to handle operations such as client connections, requests, and responses. In this log, there is an information level record, which records that a client connection from IP address 10.10.34.18 was closed by the server because the session expired. This is a normal message, indicating that the component is working properly and client connections are being handled normally. So there is no exception.
