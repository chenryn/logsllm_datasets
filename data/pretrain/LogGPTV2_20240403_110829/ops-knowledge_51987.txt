User: I have a fair number of smaller projects / libraries that I have been using over the past 2 years.  I am thinking about moving them to Google Code to make it easier to share with co-workers and easier to import them into new projects on my own environments.  The are things like a simple FSMs, CAN (Controller Area Network) drivers, and GPIB drivers.  Most of them are small (less than 500 lines), so it makes me wonder are these types of things too small for a stand alone open-source project?
Note that I would like to make it opensource because it does not give me, or my company, any real advantage.
Assistant: 500 lines? That's a lot in my opinion.
Sounds just fine to publish them as a project. I mean how many blog posts have you read with just some code that saved you hours?
Now imagine that but 500 lines of code and a permanent host designed for the purpose
