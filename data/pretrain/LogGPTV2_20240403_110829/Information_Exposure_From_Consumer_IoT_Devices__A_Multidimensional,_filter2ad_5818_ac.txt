Table 4: Organizations contacted by multiple devices.
US devices contact 13 overseas countries and several countries in
the EU, while devices from the UK contact only 7 overseas countries
including the US. From the oversea countries, most of the traffic is
sent to China as many Chinese devices rely on the services provided
by the Alibaba Cloud.
4.3 Commonly Contacted Destinations
Next, we analyze which non-first-party domains and companies are
contacted by the largest number of devices. These parties can learn
a great deal about the devices in a home and how they are used.
Information Exposure From Consumer IoT Devices
IMC ’19, October 21–23, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands
Even the knowledge of a significant subset of devices in a given
home could be used to profile users for data-driven algorithms such
as targeted advertising.
For this analysis, we focus on the destination organization, e.g.,
nest.com and google.com belong to the Google organization that
owns both properties. A single device may contact multiple or-
ganizations, e.g., the Samsung TV contacts two non-first-party
organizations: Netflix (a third party), and Amazon AWS (a support
party), which hosts Netflix.
Table 4 lists the ten companies contacted by the largest number
of devices. We find that 31 devices in the US and 24 in the UK
contact at least one server that belongs to Amazon, largely due to
their reliance on AWS for hosting servers. The next-most commonly
contacted organizations are also hosting providers: Google, Akamai,
and Microsoft. Thus, a substantial contributing factor to the amount
of information exposed to non-first-parties is the use of supporting
parties that provide computing resources.
Nearly all TV devices in our testbeds contacts Netflix even though
we never configured any TV with a Netflix account. This, at the very
least, exposes information to Netflix about the model of TV at a
given location. The bottom half of the table (apart from AT&T)
consists of Chinese counterparts to Amazon and Google. These
servers are predominantly contacted by devices designed by Chi-
nese companies.
Generally, connecting a device to the Internet via a VPN did
not lead to significant differences. The only unexpected case was
the US based Xiaomi Rice Cooker contacted Kingsoft only when
connected via VPN, normally it contacts Alibaba cloud service.
4.4 Takeaways
When focusing simply on the destinations contacted by IoT devices,
we identified a number of privacy concerns. Several non-first-party
destinations (in particular Amazon, Google, and Akamai) receive
information from many of our IoT devices, thus allowing them
to potentially profile consumers. For example, these companies
not only can learn the types of devices in a household, but also
how/when they are used, simply by analyzing the network traffic
from IoT devices to their cloud services (see §6.3). We observe
substantial outsourcing of computing resources to cloud providers,
particularly for camera devices; further, we found TVs comprise the
largest fraction of third party communication (likely to customize
content for users). Regarding regional differences, we note that
US devices tend to contact more non-first parties, possibly due to
more relaxed privacy regulations with respect to the EU. VPNs
had minimal impact on the type of party contacted, with most
differences likely being due to serving content using replicas closer
to the VPN egress.
5 ENCRYPTION ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze whether devices send data securely
by studying the use of encryption by IoT devices in our testbed.
Adoption of encryption would be easy to measure if most network
traffic in the IoT environment used easily-identifiable protocols such
as HTTP, HTTPS, and QUIC. However, standard protocol analysis
tools (e.g., Wireshark’s protocol analyzer) fail to classify nearly
half (46%) of the network traffic originating from our testbeds.
We address this problem using entropy analysis, then use it to
characterize the volume of traffic sent securely by each device.
5.1 Identifying Encrypted Traffic
We start by using Wireshark’s protocol analyzer to identify TLS
(excluding handshakes) and QUIC traffic as encrypted. Wireshark
does not identify other encrypted protocols. Certain unclassified
network traffic contains encoded or compressed content (e.g., video,
audio, gzip compression). We search for encoding-specific bytes in
headers of such flows, and mark any traffic that contains them as
unencrypted.
For the remaining flows, we do not have ground truth as to
whether the traffic is encrypted. Therefore, we infer the use of
encryption on those flows by measuring their byte entropy H,
whose value is between 0 and 1 with higher value meaning byte
sequences that are more similar to random.
By analyzing the entropy of some randomly sampled traffic
(e.g., encrypted traffic consisting of HTTPS flows and HTTP flows
containing encrypted payload, and unencrypted traffic consisting of
HTTP flows containing textual payload), we found that the average
entropy H for the payload of encrypted traffic is Henc = 0.85 (σ =
0.009, min = 0.80, max = 0.86), while the entropy of unencrypted
textual traffic is substantially lower but has higher variance, with
average of Hunenc = 0.25 (σ = 0.09, min = 0.12, max = 0.39).
We conducted additional tests of encrypted and unencrypted
content (namely, IMC 2019 web pages) to understand how entropy
varies across encryption algorithms and cipher suites. The entropy
of the unencrypted content is Hunenc = 0.55 (σ = 0.07, min =
0.35, max = 0.62). First, we used 14 cipher suites 2 available us-
ing python’s TLS implementation, which resulted in Henc = 0.85
(σ = 0.02, min = 0.80, max = 0.87). While HTTPS encryption is
popular, other encryption schemes might yield substantially dif-
ferent entropy ranges. To investigate this, we used the python
symmetric encryption library cryptography/fernet to encrypt the
same set of IMC 2019 website content. We found the entropy of such
encrypted content led to an average Henc = 0.73 (σ = 0.025, min =
0.67, max = 0.75). Importantly, the differences in entropy values
between TLS and fernet encryption are relatively small, and in both
cases the gap between encrypted and plaintext entropy is large.
Based on these observations, we cannot identify a single thresh-
old that will always classify encrypted and unencrypted payloads
correctly. In light of this, we chose conservative thresholds for
whether a connection is encrypted or not, with the goal of reduc-
ing false positives/negatives while relegating remaining cases to
an “undetermined” class. Specifically, we classify traffic having en-
tropy H>0.8 as likely encrypted, H75

that this assumption does not hold for media content, e.g., in our
experiments with recording videos from a mobile device we found
that Hunenc = 0.873 (σ = 0.0005, min = 0.871, max = 0.874). Thus,
for cases of media (audio/video) content that are not filtered out
using recognized encodings, we use their network traffic patterns
to identify and exclude them from this analysis using the technique
described in Section 6.
5.2 Encryption Adoption
In this section we analyze the adoption of encryption by our US
and UK devices. First, we show the fraction of the traffic that we
recognize as unencrypted, encrypted, or unknown. Then, for unen-
crypted traffic we identify patterns among device categories and
activities.
Table 5 shows the number of IoT devices
Overall adoption.
that have a particular fraction of their data unencrypted (first row
✗), encrypted (second row ✓), and unknown (third row “?”). Each
subrow represents the fraction of the traffic we consider for the
classification, using quartiles. The first two columns consider the
set of all US and UK devices, the third and fourth columns consider
the set of all US and UK devices in common in both testbeds. The
remaining columns show the same data of the first four, but using
VPN egress.
The table shows some positive trends: no devices have more
than 75% unencrypted traffic, and just one of them (in each testbed)
have more than 50%, while 7 devices (in each testbed) have more
than 75% encrypted traffic. We also observe some negative trends
that reveal possible information exposure: 5 devices in the US and
2 in the UK send more than 25% unencrypted traffic, while all
but 8 devices US and all but 10 devices in the UK send more than
25% unknown traffic. This last point motivates the need for better
protocol analyzers to understand just how much of this unknown
traffic is encrypted. If we consider the devices in common between
the US and UK, and the VPN experiments we see similar trends,
meaning that except for some isolated cases we will discuss in the
next paragraph, there are no significant regional differences in the
distribution of encrypted, unencrypted, and unknown traffic for
the same devices.
Adoption by category. We now analyze information exposure
in terms of unencrypted data exposed by devices according to their
category. Table 6 shows the percentage of data exposed in aggregate
by all devices in each category (rows), partitioned into different
