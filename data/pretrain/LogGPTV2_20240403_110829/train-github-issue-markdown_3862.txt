**Migrated issue, originally created by Ronny Pfannschmidt

this problem has shown up when porting to oracle, which reported a random
error uppon seeing the sql
after inspection i was sure the code was certainly wrong - at least the join
condition makes absolutely no sense there
imho it should be an error to pass a relationship there
    from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, ForeignKey
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
    from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, Session
    Base = declarative_base()
    class Fun(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'fun'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        pos = Column(Integer)
    class FunDetail(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'fun_detail'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        fun_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('fun.id'))
        fun = relationship(Fun)
        pos = Column(Integer)
    s = Session()
    print s.query(FunDetail).order_by(FunDetail.pos, FunDetail.fun)
results in
    SELECT fun_detail.id AS fun_detail_id, fun_detail.fun_id AS fun_detail_fun_id, fun_detail.pos AS fun_detail_pos 
    FROM fun_detail ORDER BY fun_detail.pos, fun.id = fun_detail.fun_id
