User: I have a python application running on a beaglebone. How do I (in Python) check if the "/mnt" partition is mounted as read-only or read-write?
Assistant: EDIT: The answer makes the assumption that you plan to write to /mnt.
I would just try to write to it and catch OSError exception to handle the read-only case.
