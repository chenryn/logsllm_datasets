### Analysis of DNS Nameserver Sharing and Robustness

#### Introduction
This document provides an in-depth analysis of the sharing of nameservers among Second-Level Domains (SLDs) and the implications for DNS robustness. The analysis is based on a dataset spanning several years, with a focus on both host-based and network-based perspectives.

#### Host-Based Analysis
Our first exploration involves a host-based analysis of nameserver sharing. For each fully resolved SLD in our dataset, we compute the number of other SLDs that use exactly the same set of IP addresses as authoritative nameservers. We then derive a distribution across all SLDs for each month of our dataset.

**Key Findings:**
- In April 2018, half of the SLDs shared a set of nameservers with at least 163 other SLDs.
- The largest group contained 9,000 SLDs sharing the exact same set of nameservers.
- Over time, nameserver sharing at the IP level remained relatively stable, with minor variations but no significant trends.

**Table 1: Top Ten SLD Groups Based on IP Address**
| Group | Size (SLDs) | Partial SLDs | /24s | Same Last Hop |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------|---------------|
| 1     | 9,000       | 3,066        | 2    | ✓             |
| 2     | 6,111       | 328          | 2    | ✓             |
| 3     | 5,568       | 17           | 2    | ✓             |
| 4     | 5,076       | 3,727        | 2    | ✓             |
| 5     | 4,788       | 3            | 2    | ✗             |
| 6     | 4,611       | 631          | 2    | –             |
| 7     | 204,075     | 375          | 3    | ✓             |
| 8     | 69          | 648          | 2    | ✓             |
| 9     | 4,820       | –            | 4    | ✓             |
| 10    | 23          | –            | 2    | ✓             |

- The top ten groups contain over 47,000 SLDs, representing 4.7% of Alexa’s list of top sites.
- Four groups use two nameservers, meeting the minimum requirement prescribed in RFC 1034. However, most groups exceed this, with Group 5 using ten nameservers.
- Across the ten largest groups, 40 nameservers (out of 96,000 in the dataset) are responsible for 4.7% of popular SLDs.

#### Network-Based Analysis
Next, we conducted a network-based analysis, similar to the host-based analysis. We determined the /24 address blocks containing each fully resolved SLD's nameservers and then identified the set of other SLDs that leverage nameservers in the same /24 blocks.

**Key Findings:**
- There is more shared infrastructure when viewed from a network perspective than from a host perspective.
- Sharing of network-level infrastructure has become more common over time.
- In April 2018, half of the SLDs belonged to groups with at least 3,000 other SLDs, a 25-fold increase compared to April 2009.
- The maximum group size increased from 34,000 SLDs in April 2009 to 71,000 SLDs in April 2018.

| Group | Size (SLDs) | Partial SLDs | /24s | Same Last Hop |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------|---------------|
| 1     | 71,000      | 3,066        | 2    | ✓             |
| 2     | 70,000      | 328          | 2    | ✓             |
| 3     | 15,000      | 17           | 2    | ✓             |
| 4     | 14,000      | 3,727        | 2    | ✓             |
| 5     | 13,000      | 3            | 2    | ✗             |
| 6     | 12,000      | 631          | 2    | –             |
| 7     | 204,075     | 375          | 3    | ✓             |
| 8     | 69          | 648          | 2    | ✓             |
| 9     | 4,820       | –            | 4    | ✓             |
| 10    | 23          | –            | 2    | ✓             |

- The largest group includes over 71,000 SLDs that have outsourced their DNS services to CloudFlare.
- The second-largest group, with nearly 70,000 SLDs, is run by GoDaddy.
- Nine DNS providers are represented across the ten groups, with CloudFlare appearing twice.
- The ten groups cover more than 20% of the popular SLDs.

#### Distribution of Alexa Ranks
We analyzed the data to determine whether shared infrastructure occurs more frequently in higher or lower-ranked domains. Figure 5 shows the distribution of Alexa ranks for three exemplar groups from Table 2.

- Group 6 (black line) is approximately uniformly distributed.
- Group 1 (blue line) skews towards more popular SLDs.
- Group 2 (red line) skews towards less popular SLDs.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Topological Diversity:** DNS providers should increase the topological diversity of their nameservers in terms of both servers and edge networks.
2. **Robustness Vigilance:** SLD owners should remain vigilant about the robustness of their DNS providers and consider leveraging multiple providers or retaining in-house DNS capabilities.
3. **Backup Records:** The DNS could benefit from the notion of "backup" records, allowing SLDs to list secondary nameservers that are used only when primary nameservers are unreachable.

#### Summary and Future Work
While this analysis is initial and can be improved, it highlights areas where DNS robustness can be enhanced. Future work will include a deeper analysis based on more and different data, a better understanding of anycast routing, and addressing additional aspects of robustness.
