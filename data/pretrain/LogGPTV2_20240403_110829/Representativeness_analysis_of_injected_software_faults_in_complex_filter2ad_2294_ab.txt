### WAEP and WPFV: Common Faults in Software

#### Overview of Common Faults
- **Missing Variable Initialization**: This occurs when a variable is used before it has been assigned a value.
- **Missing Variable Assignment Using a Value**: Similar to the first, but specifically involves using an uninitialized variable in an assignment.
- **Wrong Arithmetic Function Call Expression Used in Parameter**: An incorrect arithmetic function or expression is passed as a parameter.
- **Wrong Variable Used in Function Call Parameter**: The wrong variable is passed as a parameter to a function.

These faults are frequently observed in software and can be emulated for testing purposes. Our work aims to identify and inject these faults to improve the representativeness of fault classes in complex software systems.

#### Research Context
Our research builds on previous efforts to evaluate and enhance the representativeness of injected faults. The primary goal is to ensure that pre-release faults (those found during system and function testing) are similar to post-release defects. This is crucial because fault injection is typically performed during the late phases of the software lifecycle, such as during or after function and system testing.

#### Research Problems
1. **Triggering Conditions of Emulated Faults**:
   - **Problem Statement**: Determine if emulated faults are triggered under conditions similar to those of real defects.
   - **Relevance**: Fault injection is less effective if the triggers are not representative of real-world conditions.

2. **Identifying and Removing Elusive Faults**:
   - **Problem Statement**: Develop a method to distinguish between elusive and non-elusive faults to improve the representativeness of the fault load.
   - **Approach**: Use software complexity metrics to characterize and remove elusive faults from the fault load.

#### Methodology
1. **Fault Injection**:
   - Generate a large set of faulty versions of the target system, each containing one fault.
   - Select a subset of test cases from the original test suite.
   - Execute each faulty version with each test case and collect failure data.
   - Analyze the failure data to identify non-elusive faults.
   - Evaluate software complexity metrics to define criteria for identifying non-elusive faults.

2. **Case Study and Experimental Setup**:
   - **Target System**: MySQL, a widely used DBMS.
   - **Experimental Setup**: Use a tool to inject faults into the MySQL source code and execute test cases to detect failures.
   - **Test Suite**: 473 test cases for core functionalities, selected to balance between thoroughness and manageability.

#### Results and Discussion
- **Failure Analysis**:
  - Out of 2 million experiments, 282,739 failures were observed.
  - Some test cases were ineffective and removed, leaving 40 test cases.
  - Failure occurrences for each fault and test case are visualized in Figure 3.

- **Elusiveness of Faults**:
  - Faults are categorized as elusive (activated in a low number of executions) and non-elusive (easily detected by most test cases).
  - Figure 4 shows the distribution of failures and correct executions for each fault.

#### Conclusion
The study demonstrates the importance of realistic fault injection and the need to differentiate between elusive and non-elusive faults. By using software complexity metrics, we can improve the representativeness of the fault load and enhance the effectiveness of fault injection techniques in complex software systems.
