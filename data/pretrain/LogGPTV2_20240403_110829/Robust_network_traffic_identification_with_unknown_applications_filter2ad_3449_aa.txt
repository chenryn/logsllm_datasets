**Abstract:**
Network traffic classification is a fundamental tool for network management and security. A significant challenge to the robustness of classification performance comes from zero-day applications that are previously unknown in traffic classification systems. This paper proposes a new scheme, Robust Statistical Traffic Classification (RTC), which combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to address this challenge. The RTC scheme can identify traffic from zero-day applications and accurately discriminate predefined application classes. Additionally, we develop a method for automating the optimization of RTC parameters. Empirical studies on real-world traffic data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, showing significantly better classification performance compared to four state-of-the-art methods when zero-day applications are present.

## I. Introduction

Traffic classification is essential for network management and security, enabling the identification of different applications and protocols in a network. For example, Quality of Service (QoS) control mechanisms use traffic classification to prioritize applications across limited bandwidth. Similarly, network managers need to understand the applications and protocols in network traffic to implement appropriate security policies. Over the past decade, traffic classification has received considerable attention from both industry and academia.

There are three main categories of traffic classification methods:
1. **Port-based:** Relies on checking standard ports used by well-known applications.
2. **Payload-based:** Searches for application signatures in the payload of IP packets.
3. **Flow statistics-based:** Uses statistical features such as inter-packet time without requiring deep packet inspection (DPI).

While port-based and payload-based methods have limitations, flow statistics-based methods using machine learning techniques have gained popularity. However, these methods often struggle with zero-day applications, which can constitute up to 60% of flows and 30% of bytes in a network traffic dataset. Misclassifying zero-day traffic into known classes degrades the accuracy of known class classifications.

In this paper, we propose a novel traffic classification scheme, Robust Traffic Classification (RTC), to address the problem of zero-day applications. The key contributions of our work are:
- A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning to handle zero-day applications.
- An effective method to extract zero-day traffic samples from unlabeled network traffic.
- A new method for automating the optimization of RTC parameters.

Our empirical studies on real-world traffic datasets show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the presence of zero-day applications. We also provide a quantitative study based on probability theory to demonstrate how flow correlation can benefit traffic classification.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work on flow statistics-based traffic classification. Section III presents the proposed RTC scheme. Section IV details the parameter optimization method. Section V reports the experimental results. Section VI provides further discussion, and Section VII concludes the paper.

## II. Related Work

Current research on network traffic classification focuses on applying machine learning techniques to flow statistics-based methods, which avoid the limitations of port-based and payload-based methods. However, flow statistics-based methods face challenges, particularly with zero-day applications due to the rapid development of new applications.

### A. N-Class Classification

Conventional flow statistics-based methods address an n-class classification problem without considering zero-day traffic. Supervised methods use labeled flow samples to construct a classifier, which misclassifies zero-day traffic into known classes, severely affecting classification performance. Early work by Moore and Zuev [6] applied naive Bayes techniques, while later work used Bayesian neural networks [7], support vector machines [8], and other algorithms. Our previous work [4] incorporated flow correlation into supervised classification, improving performance even with insufficient training data.

### B. (N+1)-Class Classification

Semi-supervised methods have been proposed to handle unknown applications. These methods group labeled and unlabeled training samples into clusters and map them to known or unknown classes. While these methods show potential, they still face challenges, especially with one-class classification, where the decision boundary is difficult to define without information about unknown classes.

## III. Proposed Scheme: RTC

Existing traffic classification methods suffer from the lack of zero-day traffic samples in the training stage. Our work aims to build a robust classifier by extracting zero-day samples from unlabeled network data and incorporating them into the training process.

### Framework of RTC

The RTC framework consists of three key modules:
1. **Unknown Discovery:** Automatically identifies new samples of zero-day traffic in unlabeled traffic collected from the target network.
2. **BoF-Based Traffic Classification:** Uses prelabeled training samples and zero-day traffic samples to build a robust classifier.
3. **System Update:** Continuously updates the system to incorporate new zero-day traffic samples and optimize parameters.

By combining these modules, the RTC scheme effectively addresses the challenge of zero-day applications and improves the overall accuracy of traffic classification.
