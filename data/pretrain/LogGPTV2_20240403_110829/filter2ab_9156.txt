**ATT&CK ID:** S0688  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Meteor

**Description:**
Meteor is a technique used to overwrite the contents of a victim's files and directories with zero-bytes, effectively destroying the original data, before deleting the files. [22]

This method can be particularly destructive as it not only deletes the files but also ensures that the original content is irretrievable, making data recovery extremely difficult.
