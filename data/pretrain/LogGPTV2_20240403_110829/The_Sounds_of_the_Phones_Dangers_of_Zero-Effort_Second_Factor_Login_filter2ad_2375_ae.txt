tion level). This suggests that the demo app is using 6-second long
audio snippets rather than 3-second.
Overall, this analysis suggests that the Sound-Proof demo app
uses much stricter parameters, which resulted in very high FNRs.
Notably, even with this parametrization resulting in very low us-
ability (high FNR), the Sound-Danger attack can still be successful
against the demo app, further validating its feasibility as a viable
real-work attack against Sound-Proof.
Attacking Sound-Proof Smartwatch Implementation: Sound-
Proof is currently implemented with a smartphone as the second
factor device. However, if Sound-Proof is implemented using other
devices, such as smartwatches, as brieﬂy discussed in [17], our
Sound-Danger attacks will still work. When an attacker makes a
call to the victim’s phone, the victim’s smartwatch would record the
ambient audio containing the call’s sound generated by the phone.
This audio sample recorded by the smartwatch is similar to the au-
dio samples recorded by the smartphone, hence these two audio
(from phone or from watch) should yield similar correlation val-
ues as that between the audio samples of phone and terminal. If
the smartwatch itself features a speaker and rings when a call or
a notiﬁcation is received, a similar attack will still apply. Android
Wear 1.4 provides support for the devices with embedded speak-
ers, such as Huawei watches and ASUS ZenWatch 2 available in
Google Store. Moreover, our preliminary study on smartwatches
shows that the current smartwatches do not feature high quality mi-
crophones as in phones and the correlation using the audio recorded
by a smartwatch has higher error rates compared to that using the
audio recorded by a phone. In the future, if smartwatches features
better microphones along with speaker hardware and become stan-
dalone devices (no companion device, like a phone, needed), these
smartwatches would still be vulnerable to our attacks.
Attacking Other Security Applications: As we will review in
Section 9, there are different systems which use audio as one
of the modalities to detect the co-presence of two devices. Co-
presence detection of two devices has generally been proposed in
the context of mobile payment applications to prevent relay attacks
[16, 22, 26]. Further, another security scheme is aimed for pairing
of devices based on common ambient audio signals [22]. How-
ever, the threat model for co-presence detection and device pairing
systems differs from that for 2FA systems. These systems do not
consider that the user information is leaked and that the attacker
may already know the phone numbers and other speciﬁcs associ-
ated with the corresponding users. Further, our attacks become dif-
ﬁcult against such co-presence detection systems as the attacker has
to interact with the point-of-sale (POS) payment terminal in a retail
store rather than the web browser under its full control.
If we extend the threat model of the above systems such that
the attacker knows the phone number/user id of the user, then our
attacks are applicable. A motivated attacker against co-presence
detection systems [16, 26] can go near a POS terminal and gener-
ate a ringtone audio at its side (let’s say in a jewelry store) while
a colluding attacker makes call/sends notiﬁcation to the victim’s
phone at the same time (let’s say in a restaurant). This will break
the co-presence detection system as audio at both ends can be dom-
inated by the ringer’s audio. In a similar vein, the security of device
pairing systems based on ambient audio [22] can be compromised.
Here, the attacker can perform an active attack to produce certain
sounds which will then be used by the pairing system as a seed
to generate a common secret between two devices. If the ringtone
dominates the ambient noise then the seed used by victim’s devices
can match with the seed at the attacker’s side.
9. RELATED WORK
Two-Factor Authentication: Most common and traditional form
of 2FA employs hardware tokens such as RSA SecurID [21] and
Yubico [27]. These hardware tokens are specialized devices used
solely for the purpose of authentication. Such schemes require
users to carry and interact with the token. These schemes may be
expensive to deploy because the service provider must provide one
such token per customer.
Many software tokens 2FA schemes are also available, includ-
ing Google 2-Step Veriﬁcation [14], Duo Push [12], and Celestix’s
HOTPin [3]. These schemes are both scalable and ﬂexible as single
personal device can be used with multiple services in such schemes.
These schemes are also cost effective, since deploying software to-
kens are logistically much simpler. These schemes prompt the user
with a push message on his phone with current login attempt infor-
mation and the user interacts with his phone to authorize the login.
PhoneAuth [11] is a software token 2FA scheme that leverages
Bluetooth communication between the browser and the phone, to
eliminate user-phone interaction. The Bluetooth channel enables
the server (through the browser) and the phone to run a challenge-
response protocol which provides second authentication factor.
This scheme requires browser to have Bluetooth communication
capability which is currently not available on many browsers. Au-
thy [10] is another approach that allows seamless 2FA using Blue-
tooth communication between the computer and the phone. How-
ever, Authy requires extra software to be installed on the computer.
Traditionally, these 2FA schemes increase resistance to online
dictionary attacks. The work of [23] presented several 2FA that
are enhanced to strengthen security against both online and ofﬂine
attacks. The main idea underlying all their 2FA protocols is for the
server to store a randomized hash of the password, h = H(p, s),
and for the device to store the corresponding random secret s. The
authentication protocol checks whether the user types the correct
password p and also that it can access the device that stores s.
SlickLogin [5] (recently acquired by Google) minimizes the user
phone interaction. It employs near-ultrasounds to transfer the veri-
ﬁcation code. The notion is to generate unique near-ultrasounds for
each login attempt and use the very non-audible audio to authorize
the attempt. To verify user’s identity, a website plays a uniquely
generated, nearly-silent sound through the computer’s speakers. An
app running on the user’s phone picks up the sound, analyzes it, and
sends the signal back to the site’s server. The server veriﬁes the user
with the possession of the phone as a second factor.
Co-Presence Detection: Similar to 2FA systems, co-presence de-
tection systems use different medium to verify the co-presence of
two devices. The common application of such co-presence detec-
tion system is to prevent relay attacks. Although relay attacks are
usually targeted attacks, we discuss them here as some of the sys-
tems using ambient audio can be thwarted with our attacks.
Schurmann et al. [22] use ambient sound to establish a secure
communication channel among devices based on similar audio pat-
terns. They exploit ambient sound as the seed to generate a com-
mon secret for the secure information exchange and authentication.
Halevi et al. [16] use ambient audio to detect the co-presence of
two devices in payment scenario. In an NFC transaction, they cor-
relate the audio collected from two devices (NFC phone and NFC
918reader) and validate if both devices are together. They mention that
if the attacker manipulates physical environment, it may succeed
in launching relay attack, however, the tampering with audio looks
like a daunting task and such activity can be easily detected.
Truong et al. [26] use various Radio Frequency (RF) sensors
such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS besides audio to detect the co-
presence of two devices. In their work, they report that when the
system uses only audio to detect the co-presence between two de-
vices, F-measure is 0.933 with 4.09% FPR in benign setting. How-
ever, in an adversarial setting, the FPR rises to 100.00% where
the attacker manipulates the audio signal only. In their adversar-
ial setting, the attacker captures the ambient information (audio)
near device 1 and reproduces that information (audio) near device
2 without suppressing the ambient information sensed by device 2.
10. CONCLUSION
Zero-effort two-factor authentication is a compelling notion that
may push two-factor authentication towards wide-scale adoption
on the web. The idea of using ambient sounds to verify the user’s
possession of (or proximity to) the authentication token (phone) is
intriguing, which aims to remove the human user from the loop of
authentication (except of password entry). In this paper, we demon-
strated that the ambient audio approach to zero-effort two-factor
authentication is highly susceptible to a remote attack that makes
the phone record its own predictable sounds in the form of a ringer,
app-based notiﬁcations and alarms. Since these sounds are pre-
dictable, the attacker can generate the same (very similar or highly
correlated) sounds at the browser’s end under its full control and
succeed in logging into the user’s account. Further, by proactively
collecting statistics about a given population (not a speciﬁc user),
the attacker can devise a strategy that can allow the attacker to com-
promise a large fraction of users’ accounts in a short span of time.
Since the attack exploits the sounds of the phones, one obvious
defense would be to deliberately mute the phone at the time the lo-
gin takes place. However, this may reduce user experience since
important calls or notiﬁcations may be missed or delayed. Fur-
ther work is necessary to assess this and other potential mitigation
strategies we presented in the paper. Overall, our work serves to
call the security of a prominent, deployment-ready zero-effort two-
factor authentication scheme into question, highlight the tension
between the security and usability of two-factor authentication and
raise a demand for utmost care when attempting to design authen-
tication approaches transparent to the human user.

We would like to thank CCS 2016 anonymous reviewers, and Ab-
hishek Anand, Tzipora Halevi and Hugo Krawczyk for their useful
feedback on a previous version of the paper. This work has been
funded in part by NSF CNS-1526524 and CNS-1547350 grants.
We notiﬁed the authors of the Sound-Proof system [17] about the
reported vulnerability. The authors acknowledged the vulnerability
and indicated that they had applied several patches, in line with the
potential mitigations suggested in Section 7. While these ﬁxes may
serve to defeat the vulnerability, the usability of the system may
be reduced (as discussed in Section 7), which we believe is the
fundamental challenge in the design of zero-effort authentication
systems demanding continued future research.
