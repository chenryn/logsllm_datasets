##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
redhat_subscription
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.0.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
RHEL 7.3
##### SUMMARY
redhat_subscription manager is overloading the value type of the original
subscription manager. This causes confusion and over-consumption of
entitlements.
The official Red Hat Subscription Manager allows attaching subscriptions by
Pool ID, NOT by Pool Name.
    [root@rhel7 ~]# subscription-manager attach --help
    Usage: subscription-manager attach [OPTIONS]
    Attach a specified subscription to the registered system
    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --proxy=PROXY_URL     proxy URL in the form of proxy_hostname:proxy_port
      --proxyuser=PROXY_USER
                            user for HTTP proxy with basic authentication
      --proxypassword=PROXY_PASSWORD
                            password for HTTP proxy with basic authentication
      --pool=POOL           the ID of the pool to attach (can be specified more
                            than once)
      --quantity=QUANTITY   number of subscriptions to attach
      --auto                Automatically attach compatible subscriptions to this
                            system. This is the default action.
      --servicelevel=SERVICE_LEVEL
                            service level to apply to this system
      --file=FILE           A file from which to read pool IDs. If a hyphen is
                            provided, pool IDs will be read from stdin.
    [root@rhel7 ~]# 
Because this module is allowing a user to specify a name and trying to do its
own logic and parsing of available Pool IDs, it is incorrectly attempting to
extend the capabilities of the official subscription manager. It also does it
poorly, allowing multiple subscriptions to be consumed when they were not
desired.
Large customers will have many duplicate subscriptions of the same name due to
growth and purchases made at different times. This could have a very large
impact to large customers.
The feature to enable using the Pool ID is a good start, but we also must
remove the capability of adding by Name. This Ansible module should not
attempt to do more than the original tool allows.  
ansible/ansible-modules-core#4603
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
    - redhat_subscription:
        state: present
        username: "{{ rhn_username }}"
        password: "{{ rhn_password }}"
        pool: '^Employee SKU$'
    #    pool: "{{ POOL_ID }}"
      when: ansible_distribution == 'RedHat'
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Only a single Pool ID attached, presumably the first one matched. But
certainly not ALL matches.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
I have altered the values below to protect our actual Pool IDs (XXX, YYY,
ZZZ). I can provide actual examples privately.
