demonstrated the performance of our framework and algorithms
using real network topologies and trafﬁc traces.
There are multiple directions for future work. One is a thorough
quantiﬁcation of the effects of cross-provider SRLG data. Another
one is to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on smaller IP
networks instead of the backbone networks that we evaluated. Fur-
ther improvement on TE robustness under dynamic topology is also
an interesting issue.

Robust TE/FRR with VPN Support
Our algorithm in Section 3.3 can be described by the following three
optimization problems. We ﬁrst compute a base routing with hose-model
VPN bandwidth provisioning using (8):
∀link l ∈ E and VPN trafﬁc demand matrix dw such that
∀a ∈ V, ∑
≤ ECR(a), ∑
dw

be a solution to (8). For each high-priority failure scenario h ⊂ E,
Let f

In (9), constraint (10) requires that all VPN trafﬁc be completely rerouted
using intradomain links only.
If (9) has no feasible solutions (i.e., it cannot reroute VPN trafﬁc using
intradomain links only), we solve (11):
min f h
s.t.
r
f h is a fast rerouting in E ∪ E

In (11), there is no distinction between best-effort and VPN trafﬁc.
The VPN bandwidth provisioning constraint in (8) involves an exponen-
tial number of constraints, but can be converted into a polynomial number
of constraints by applying linear programming duality:
∀a ∈ V : μl(a) ≥ 0,νl(a) ≥ 0;
∀a, b ∈ V : fab(l) ≤ μl(a) + νl(b);
∑
a∈V
(μl(a)ECR(a) + νl(a)ICR(a)) ≤ cap(l).
Proof of Lemma 1
The constraint (10) can be handled in a similar way.
B.
PROOF. First consider an OD pair a → b and the corresponding path
set Pab = {P1
}. By deﬁnition of a Q-percentage coverage path
set, there exists a path-based routing (cid:2)pab with value | (cid:2)pab| = Q. Let pab
ab, for all k =
be another path-based routing over Pab such that pk

|pab| =

∑
k=1
Thus, pab is a valid path-based routing from a to b over the path set Pab.
Applying the same scaling for all OD pairs, we obtain a valid path-based
routing p for the network over the Q-percentage coverage path set P.
Now for any demand d and any link l ∈ E, we have

where the last inequality holds due to Inequality (3). This completes the
proof.
