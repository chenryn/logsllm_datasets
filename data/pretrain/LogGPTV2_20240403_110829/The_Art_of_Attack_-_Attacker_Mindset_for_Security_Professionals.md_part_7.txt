ing the Lehman Brothers, a company I’ve chosen because they have
long since gone out of business. I search Google using the Time
Tool, a search function that can collect search results for your query
before a certain date, during a date range, or after a date when set. I
set it to display information between January 1, 2000 and December
31, 2007. I find two items that allow me to begin developing a pre-
text as if I was building an attack, circa 2002. Notably, this is a very
straightforward example, and it showcases the simplest of attack
development to get us started.
Finding No. 1 (see Figure 3.2) supplies me with the target’s phys-
ical address. Eventually, after searching that address, I am taken to
Finding No. 2, which gives me information on the building. The
same page leads me to a PDF document that includes the architect,
engineers, and suppliers of the building (Figure 3.3).

From here I have a few choices. I hesitate in choosing which
line to follow first. If I could impersonate the elevator supplier or
engineering company representative, I’d probably have free access
to the whole building. But pretending to represent the facility man-
agement company would also gain me a lot of freedoms and cover.
Because of this, I start by searching for the facility management
company, which turns out to be Hines Interests LP. But ultimately,
I choose Otis Elevator— they are well known, and the use of an Otis
Elevator UTF fire service key would likely gain me access to any
floor I want.
Admittedly this is pretty easy stuff, so I’ll provide one more
example. This example shows another avenue to a pretext and
hints at the volume of information available without even using
a Google dork. By using and mixing operators, a Google dork can
46 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
help a user locate sensitive, buried information that is not well pro-
tected. Using these operators, or dorks, a user’s searches become
advanced searches.
Pivoting slightly from the first search, instead of choosing to
search the address of the business, I choose the SEC ALT number,
which is the Securities and Exchange Commission number, given
as 0000089562.
This search takes me to a page similar to the first search. The
page, shown in Figure 3.4, lets me download a document (see Fig-
ure 3.5), called a Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition;
collect the signature and telephone number of the chief financial
officer (CFO); and also ascertain their auditors to have been Ernst
& Young (EY).

With these findings, I consider posing as a consultant from EY
and spoofing the number of the CFO to bypass reception.
From here, we can move to the second phase of development,
which is also split into two.

Phase 2
Before delving into the second phase, let’s discuss the two subsec-
tions of Phase 2. First, building the two subsections does sometimes
happen simultaneously due to the nature of information— when
searching for one thing, we invariably stumble onto other informa-
tion that’s not helpful at that exact moment but that might be of use
later. Within the framework, gathering this information is referred
to as “developing the information in each category” and “combin-
ing the information sets.” Ultimately, this means that there’s gath-
ering information to support your pretext and there’s gathering
information to further your attack.
48 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
Sticking with the Lehman Brothers example, if I were to build
up OSINT to pose as an Otis employee, I’d need a similar uniform
and an ID badge; I’d need to know about offices and depots they
have; and I’d have to see if I could find any information online about
how often they service their elevators. I would also consider call-
ing as an Otis employee to the building/maintenance company to
schedule an appointment to inspect the elevators or to try to ascer-
tain when they were last scheduled. I would also want to show up
with seemingly legitimate paperwork to support my pretext. This is
all OSINT heavy.
For the other subsection, recon development, I would look for
information that could bolster my objective. If my objective was to
get to their security operations center (SOC), I would look for infor-
mation on what kind of security doors were in the building, search
for building blueprints, and meticulously go through social media
accounts to see if there’s ever been a photo posted from within the
SOC. I’d comb through LinkedIn, searching for the people who
work in it.
For both phases, it is fair to say that the real test of knowledge
gained isn’t in its truth but in its utility.
Application
The development of an attack is the ability to assess any business’s
vulnerabilities through our AMs lens by parsing seemingly innocu-
ous information or leaked information to form an attack. The appli-
cation is the leveraging of that information to perform our attack.
Let’s look at application from a high level. There are many ways
to attack:
Physical Attacks An attack on a physical resource, such as a
facility, building, or other physical asset.
Human Attack An attack that involves social engineering
and the manipulation of people to achieve the objective, also at
a physical resource/facility, but usually one with human capital,
includes vishing (voice phishing).
The Attacker Mindset Framework 49
Cyberattacks Cyberattacks can range from installing spy-
ware or malware onto a computer or network to attempting to
destroy the infrastructure.
Phishing falls between the latter two categories, with both a human
and a technological component.
Theoretical Attacks Often used for strategy and decision mak-
ing, a theoretical attack offers companies and organizations fresh
perspectives for a hypothetical future. It is typically performed by
two opposing teams, generally external to the organization, that
test the weight of the intelligence given to them, both arriving at
different outcomes based on the same information. This informa-
tion can be pivotal for decision makers who can then choose a
path more easily, especially when the stakes are high.
The second phase of development sees you gather information
to realistically mount an attack. Earlier in that section, I said that
as an Otis employee, I’d need a similar uniform, an ID badge, and
knowledge of typical maintenance schedules they keep with regard
to their elevators—m aybe because they are required by law or regu-
lation. This type of information feeds the application and execution
of the attack. With this information and the other items I’ve found
on them as a company, I could comfortably mount an attack. The
comfort, however, isn’t just in how much I can seem like an Otis
employee. It is also about how I conduct myself in the face of fac-
tors that will remain unknown until I walk in the door on the day.
The application of information is powerful, but there’s informa-
tion that will only be available to you on the day, such as the person
you’re dealing with, their mood, the proclivity for security, and their
job role as well as your own effect on them. To steer the odds in your
favor, you should employ the following:
Confidence in Your Character This doesn’t mean to say you
must act confident. If you are posing as a lost foreigner (hey, it’s
worked for me before), then you shouldn’t really be too confi-
dent, but you should have confidence in your “character” or pre-
text choice.
50 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
Commitment to Your Character You cannot enter as the
lost foreigner or an Otis employee or any other and disengage
from that character unless planned. This plan, for me, includes if
I get caught. I will keep in character for as long as I can until I
am sure they will not let me go (obviously I would try again) or if
they threaten to call the authorities. If one or both of these occur, I
explain the situation and ask for my point of contact to be reached.
There is, however, a line. On my first job for my current company,
Social-E ngineer LLC, I went in as a satellite specialist there to
renew a license. I also got someone to let me on the roof to check
the equipment. This was overkill. I was in the building, I was get-
ting all the flags required by scope, but I wanted to see how far my
character could get me—i t was close to a pointless exercise, and the
equipment on the roof wasn’t in my flag list. However, I offered the
information to the client because I wanted to (a) be transparent and
(b) show all the weaknesses I found. I said earlier it was close to a
pointless exercise. It’s useful for the client to know how far you can
get. Since it was considered within scope, and the roof hadn’t been
struck off, I committed to my character too much and essentially
did the job of the person I was impersonating.
Commitment to character might end when commitment to
another begins. If you enter a building as an outside special-
ist but get deeper into the environment and need to assume
another identity to get further, you absolutely can. You just
can’t be both at the same time, and you should leave as the
character you walked in as so as to not raise flags.
The third law states that you never break pretext. This law actually
means that you are never yourself. You are always in character.
You are always disguised as a threat for the sake of the fourth law:
the objective is the central point from which all other moves an
attacker makes hinge from.
The Attacker Mindset Framework 51
Narrative Effect As humans, we love stories. In reality, we
don’t always see the truth. We rely on a biased set of cognitive pro-
cesses to get to a conclusion or belief. This natural tendency to
view our thoughts as facts to fit with our existing beliefs is known
as motivated reasoning—a nd we all do it.
Though we may see ourselves as rational beings, we are very
reactionary. Most of our decisions aren’t rational. This is why the
application of pretext is important and not only the application of
information we have to use against the client. As human beings
we’re wired to interpret information as confirming our beliefs and
to reject information if it runs counter to those beliefs. So if I show
up in an Otis uniform and the building has no elevator, that’s going
to send up a few red flags.
According to Sara Gorman, a public health specialist, and her
father Jack, a psychiatrist, “[R]esearch suggests that processing
information that supports your beliefs leads to a dopamine rush,”
and as we know, dopamine is addictive. On the flip side, infor-
mation that is inconsistent with one’s beliefs produces a negative
response. This leads people to see what they want to see so they
can believe what they want to believe— so preload them.
Preloading
Preloading is influencing your target before the event takes place. In
other words, the attack starts before you’ve walked in the door—
how you walk, how you carry yourself, what you are wearing, and
your demeanor, posture, facial expression, everything down to your
gait, are all factors in your success—i t’s all part of the attack. Get
people to believe what you want them to, what fits the narrative
you’re selling, and you will find yourself with an easier target. It’s a
great way to begin the application phase.
“Right Time, Right Place” Preload
Preloading can work by simply being in the right place at the right
time. Imagine you are a target for a moment; you are at a work
event and someone approaches you, seemingly interested in you
52 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
and your job. It doesn’t seem too threatening—a fter all, it’s just
someone interested in learning about your job and at a place that
seems appropriate to do so. Before long you’re talking about how
you deploy patches or how you store customer information; they
are captivated and so curious about it all— finally, a perfect stranger
cares about databases as much as you do. Much of this is accom-
plished through preloading. They were where they were supposed
to be and were interested in something that doesn’t seem too far-
fetched, given the circumstances, location, and backdrop. The
attacker presented themselves in the right place at the right time.
If, as an attacker, you can preload by merely being in the right
environment, half of your job is done for you.
Preloading is one of the best tools at your disposal in the appli-
cation phase. It does much of the heavy lifting, and combined with
your commitment to character, you become powerful as you apply
information to gain information— all to achieve your objective.
Ethics
As the good guys, all of what we’re learning here is underpinned
by something a malicious attacker will never have or use: eth-
ics and morals. Keeping the moral line between us and them
and choosing to be bound by ethics is the staple of the mindset I
am trying to teach. You can’t— and don’t— always show it in the
moment, since it’s the antithesis of our job when in attack mode,
but our moral compass wins in the end, when you help rebuild
the pieces. In doing this, you make companies, employees, and
the public safer.
There is another point of consideration when delving into eth-
ics that I often find myself talking about in speeches I give to agen-
cies and companies alike: believing you’re doing the right thing
can still make you feel as if you are not. And vice versa— feeling
you are doing the right thing doesn’t necessarily mean you’re actu-
ally doing the right thing. Ethics is a field that isn’t always black
and white.
The Attacker Mindset Framework 53
Intellectual Ethics
To intellectually believe you are doing the right thing will require
analysis of the situation on your part. To intellectually believe
you’re being ethical, you will need truth, knowledge, and under-
standing. These three things are what distinguish intellectual ethics
from the presumption of ethics at play or merely feeling you are
operating ethically. The line of ethics is movable; it’s decided by the
spectrum your target sits on. If you hunt terrorists, you don’t have
to apply ethics against your target or environment, as professional
social engineers often do. You must apply ethics against the greater
good. The Innocent Lives Foundation tracks and traces pedophiles.
Ethics are not applied against the targets in these cases, either. They
are applied against the greater good.
As an attacker, sometimes your job is to deceive people for the
greater good, even if they are good people, and ultimately, you will
lie for a living. That can chip away at even the most stoic among us.
But, intellectually at least, there are different kinds of lying. First
and foremost, there’s anti- and prosocial lying. If you truthfully
understand that, after assessing all the information available to you,
you’re conducting your actions on behalf of something bigger than
yourself in that moment, something that will in the end produce
a safer environment for its population, then you can intellectually
believe that you are operating ethically.
Prosocial lying requires empathy and compassion because you
need to be able to posit that what you say or do may cause harm in
the hypothetical future— which is a responsibility that shouldn’t be
shrugged off easily. But in having a sense that what you do matters,
that it is for a cause, not a seemingly malicious act for the sake of it,
you should remain intellectually safe.
Reactionary Ethics
I refer to the “feelings” of being ethical as reactionary ethics because
they are most often a reflex to a situation relative to you and your
beliefs. There are two things that can help you navigate reactionary
feelings hinging from a job: the scope and the objective.
54 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
If the scope permits your actions, then any negative feelings you
have are resolved in the context of your response. The objective is
also another indicator of whether the feeling of operating ethically
or not is sound. As an aside, choice is something that’s included in
ethics, and you should always feel you have the choice whether or
not to execute. I personally base that decision on the weight of the
greater good.
You have a morally ambiguous job as an attacker. It is cen-
tered around dishonesty, duplicity, and confidence. As I most often
describe the job of attacker, we are the intersection of corporate
spy and con artist, at least as social engineers. Network pentesters
aren’t a stone’s throw away from that description, either. Their job
is to surveille and exploit. So, where do morals come into play and
what’s the metric?
The primary moral virtue of an attacker is integrity. Integrity
comes from serving and protecting your clients. To accomplish
this goal, you must be able to explain your technical and ethical
limitations with regard to each contract. Additionally, the only line
between an ethical attacker and a malicious one is intent. Your
intent is never in question as an ethical attacker— you should never
be wondering if you do or do not agree with protecting the client.
If you are wondering that, you’ve probably flipped, and if that were
me, I would recuse myself from the project. For example, I know
I would never take a job for the Ku Klux Klan. A ridiculous state-
ment, but nonetheless it shows that you won’t always agree with
your clients’ ethos, and when that occurs, you are not the right per-
son for the job. Say no.
However, your morals cannot stand in the way of you and influ-
