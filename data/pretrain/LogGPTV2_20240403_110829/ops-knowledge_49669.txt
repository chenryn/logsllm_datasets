User:  Share the core architecture of OpenStack and the role of each component.
Assistant: The core architecture of OpenStack uses a layered architecture, which is mainly divided into two layers. The first layer is the underlying foundation, responsible for resource management and allocation, including the following main components: 1. Nova: Computing resource manager, responsible for managing virtual machine instances in OpenStack, including creating, starting, and stopping operations. 2. Cinder: block storage manager, responsible for providing persistent storage functions. 3. Neutron: Network resource manager, responsible for managing virtual networks and network connections. The second layer is the service layer, which mainly provides service interfaces, including the following main components: 1. Keystone: identity authentication service, responsible for identity verification and authentication. 2. Glance: image service, responsible for managing virtual machine images. 3. Horizon: Web interface service, providing a web management interface; 4. Heat: Automatic orchestration and management service, which can be used to automatically create and deploy OpenStack services. There are other supporting components, such as Swift (object storage), Ceilometer (monitoring service), and so on. In short, the core architecture of OpenStack is based on computing, storage, and network, and provides a complete set of cloud computing solutions through identity authentication and authentication. The role of each component is to cooperate to complete different functional modules in this solution.
