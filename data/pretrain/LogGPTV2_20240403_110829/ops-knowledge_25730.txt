User: I have Windows 10 and Python 2.7 installed. When I run IDLE I find this:
Python 2.7.10 (default, Oct 14 2015, 16:09:02) 
[MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]
I want the default compiler here to be MinGW's GCC (I already installed MinGW) becaue I cannot import Theano with the MSC compiler
I tried all the tutorials out there and every time I successfully install Theano but when I try to import it I get the error "Problem occurred during compilation with the command line below:" and I get a huge list of errors. Btw, I don't have VS installed on my system
Assistant: Edit Distutils config file C:\Python2.7\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg (Create the file if it already does not exist).
Add the following to the file:

[build]
compiler = mingw32

This should work.
