### Title: Botconf2022 - Privateloader: The Malware Behind a Devastating Pay-Per-Install Service

Pay-Per-Install (PPI) services have long been a significant component of the e-crime ecosystem. These services monetize the widespread distribution of malware by providing malware operators with mass, geo-targeted installations (often referred to as "loads") in exchange for payment. In this model, the malware operator provides the payment, malicious payloads, and targeting information, while the PPI service manages or outsources the distribution and delivery. The accessibility and relatively low costs of these services make them a powerful tool for malware operators, enabling rapid, bulk, and geographically targeted malware infections.

In this research, we focus on Privateloader, an undocumented downloader linked to an unidentified PPI service that delivers a wide range of malware payloads to infected systems. This loader is distributed through a network of websites that purport to offer cracked versions of popular software.
