User: I recently installed Java's JDK and Python in my Windows 7 system. I wanted to access both programs from the command line (whether it be cmd or cygwin) so I used the PATH global variable and entered the path to my JDK. What can I do so that python and JDK are accessed by PATH? What I am doing now is changing the PATH variable every time.
Thanks
Assistant: I'm confused.  Are you switching out the paths between the JDK and Python?  If that's the case, you can have both paths set in your system's PATH variable.  Example: C:\jdk-install\;C:\python-install
