# Environment
    Windows build number:
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.449]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable):
    No.
    Any other software?
    No.
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Open cmd.exe.
  2. Go to window properties, "Colors" page.
  3. Set "Screen Background" value to exactly `128 128 128`.
# Expected behavior
Cursor is visible no matter what background color is.
# Actual behavior
Now you see it, now you don't.
#
Current "inverse" logic is too straightforward - it literally takes the
inverse of the background, and for `128 128 128` the inverse is... `127 127
127`, which is basically the same thing. Oops.
Note: **Legacy console handles this corner case properly, as well as all
Windows versions prior to 10**.
Also, legacy console inversion algorithm is not exactly "inverse" - the colors
are slightly different (and subjectively more pleasant). Is it possible to get
this classic inversion in the modern console please?
This issue affects a text editor app that uses console color `8` (`128 128
128` in classic color scheme) to highlight various parts of text (e.g. current
line). Sudden cursor disappearing is confusing and annoying.
