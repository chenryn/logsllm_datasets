These reductions in downtime are arguably surprisingly high,
given that connection from diﬀerent operators often share
many potential sources of failures, such as local weather con-
ditions, cell towers, power, or even transmission. We see that
the measured combined downtime is not very diﬀerent from
the theoretical downtime assuming independence. Second,
the reduction depends heavily on selecting the right pair of
connections. As expected, operators that often camp on the
same RAN show a much larger correlation in their failure
pattern, and the gain from combining such connections is
limited. As shown in Fig. 19, there is often little or no gain
in combining connections from Netcom and Tele2.
7.3 Correlations in loss
Finally, we look at correlations in loss between networks.
We base our analysis on the same 5 minute intervals used in
Sec. 5. Let P (A) denote the (empirical) probability that a
connection A has a loss rate higher than 10% in a given 5
minute interval, and P (B) be the same for a connection B.
We calculate the conditional probability P (A|B) for each
pair of connections from the same node, and compare it
to the unconditional probability P (A).
If the conditional
probability ratio R = P (A|B)/P (A) is close to 1, it means
that connection A and B fails largely independent, while a
high R means that they tend to fail together. Note that by
Baye’s law, P (A|B)/P (A) = P (B|A)/P (B).

node, grouped by operators. We require that A and B have
at least one full week of overlapping measurements to be in-
cluded in the analysis. Note that the number of events where
both connections experience high loss may in some cases be
very low, so the graph should be interpreted with some care.
Some observations are still clear. First, connections from dif-
ferent networks are not completely independent. In between
25 and 70% of connection pairs, the likelihood of high packet
loss in connection A more than doubles when connection B
experiences high loss. In between 8 and 35% of the cases,
the likelihood increases more than 10 times. There are, how-
ever, clear diﬀerences between operator pairs. Not surpris-
ingly, the strongest pairwise dependence is for Netcom/Tele2
and Telenor/Network Norway. The weakest dependence is
between Ice and the other operators. This might also be
expected, since Ice operates with a diﬀerent technology, a
much lower frequency band, and has a diﬀerent customer
mix (and therefore traﬃc pattern) than the other operators.
Summary of ﬁndings. The results in this section indi-
cate that there is a large potential for increased reliability
through multi-homing to several MBB networks. There are
generally clear diﬀerences between operators in signal qual-
ity at a given location, and exploiting two connections in
parallel can potentially give 99.999% availability in many
cases.
8. RELATED WORK
Mobile broadband measurement. During the past few
years, there have been a growing interest by regulators, pol-
icy makers and the networking community in measuring the
performance of home and mobile broadband networks. Sev-
eral regulators have translated this into ongoing nationwide
eﬀorts, examples of such eﬀorts include US FCC’s Measuring
Broadband America initiative [7] and an annual activity by
the Communications Regulatory Authority of Lithuania for
measuring MBB performance [5]. A study by Sundaresan et.
al [23], partly based on the FCC data, demonstrated that
the long-term continuous monitoring from the edge is indis-
pensable for understanding and assessing home broadband
performance. Our work is the ﬁrst to present a country-
wide assessment of MBB reliability ﬁlling an important gap
in this area.
Approaches for measuring MBB networks can be classiﬁed
into three categories:
1. Crowd-sourced user initiated measurements. The most
prominent example in this respect is Mobiperf [2], an An-
droid application that measure several performance metrics
including throughput and latency. Nikravesh et al. [16] used
an extensive data set contributed by the users of two apps,
Mobiperf and Speedometer, and performed a longitudinal
analysis of MBB performance. They highlighted signiﬁcant
performance diﬀerences across operators, access technolo-
gies, and regions. They also showed that the performance of
MBB is not improving overtime, which necessitates the con-
tinuos monitoring of MBB performance. Sommers and Bar-
ford used crowd-sourced data from Speedtest.net to compare
the performance of MBB to WiFi [21]. Approaches based
on user-initiated tests can complement measurements from
dedicated infrastructures such as NNE. It is diﬃcult, how-
ever, to rely on such tests for the continuous monitoring of
MBB networks stability.
2. Measurements collected using dedicated infrastructure.
Examples of such studies include [18] and [14]. The former
used a few laptops mounted on public buses to compare the
performance of three MBB operators, while the latter used
low cost notebooks for comparing the performance of four
operators in seven locations in India. Our work falls into this
category. It is, however, based on a much larger deployment
in terms of the number measured operators, the number of
connections, geographical distribution and duration.
3. Measurements based on network-side data. Several mea-
surements used network side logs to assess various aspect
of MBB performance. Examples include, assessing RRC
state machine impact on performance [17], characterizing
the properties of cellular traﬃc [20], HTTP performance [9],
performance during crowded events [19], and TCP perfor-
mance over LTE [11]. Such logs are however only available
to operators. This line of work and ours complement each
other. Network-side data gives more insights into the net-
work internals, while end-to-end measurements can help op-
erators detecting anomalies that are not easily identiﬁable
by only using network-side monitoring, as we demonstrated
in Sec. 5.
Measurement framework and metrics. Several ongo-
ing eﬀorts are aiming to standardize the task of performing
large scale measurements [3] and to deﬁne meaningful per-
formance metrics for IP networks in general [22] and MBB
networks in particular [12]. Sundaresan et. al [23] inves-
tigated the suitability of diﬀerent metrics in characterizing
home broadband performance, while Goga and Teixeira ex-
plored several approaches for estimating broadband access
speed [8]. This paper presents a framework for assessing
MBB reliability using a large scale deployment. We believe
that our work is a timely input to the ongoing eﬀorts to
deﬁning approaches and metrics for measuring MBB net-
works.
9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
This work has presented a framework for measuring reli-
ability in MBB networks, based on the position that end-
to-end measurements can give useful insights about perfor-
mance and stability problems in the network as a whole.
The main argument in the proposed approach is that reli-
ability must be measured at several levels, from the stabil-
ity of the network connection to the reliability of the data
plane and application layer performance. We believe that
this framework gives a good basis for describing the overall
reliability of an MBB network.
In the future, this should
also be extended with measurements that capture the eﬀect
of mobility on the experienced reliability. Eﬀorts are on-
going to extend the NNE infrastructure with mobile nodes,
which would allow such measurements.
Using the proposed framework, we have presented a large-
scale study of reliability in 5 Norwegian MBB networks. We
have focused on a few selected metrics at each level in the
framework. There are still many other metrics that can be
relevant for understanding reliability. On the connection
level, the ability to establish a PDP context when needed is
an important aspect of reliability, which is diﬀerent than the
ability to maintain the connection uninterrupted for a long
time. On the data plane level, further analysis can be made
to describe the pattern of packet loss and delay variations
under varying network conditions. An important topic is
57also to look at the reliability and performance of various
transport layer protocols in MBB networks.
The measurements presented here have demonstrated that
there are clear diﬀerences in reliability between operators,
and that these can be identiﬁed and characterized by end-to-
end measurements. Networks vary in the stability of connec-
tions, in packet loss patterns, and in their ability to support
popular applications. We have also shown how end-to-end
measurements can be used to identify failures and perfor-
mance problems that are not necessarily captured by the
operators’ monitoring systems.
This study was performed on the NNE infrastructure,
with dedicated measurement nodes. The framework is, how-
ever, also applicable for studies based on crowd-sourced data
from mobile phones. Such approaches will, nevertheless, of-
ten be more limited in the availability of metadata, and in
the ability to gather long uninterrupted time series under
stable conditions.
This study has some limitations that we hope to address
in future work. First, only 2 diﬀerent 3G modem models
are used in this study. While this makes it possible to com-
pare connections across operators and regions with the same
equipment, it may also introduce eﬀects that we would not
see with other types of user terminals. In the future, we hope
to include also a few other modem types in our studies. Fur-
ther, the UMTS modems used in the NNE platform support
3G protocols up to DC-HSPA (”3.75G”), but not LTE/4G.
As LTE becomes more widespread, it will be important to
measure also these networks.
