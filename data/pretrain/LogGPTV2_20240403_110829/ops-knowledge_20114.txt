User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is a netcat server without -e exploitable? This is related to a college assignment. 

I have an Ubuntu server I am trying to do a penetration test on. The server is running a netcat server which when I contact it sends me a nice info message from the lecturer. The question is, can I exploit the fact that there is a netcat server listening. It is not running with a shell using -eoption. When I recreate the environment on my own machines, everything I type on the client appears on the screen on the server as is expected but obviously the command (e.g. ls) are not executed.

I can't tell what version of netcat is running so I don't know if it has known vulnerabilities however all other services are fully patched so I suspect this is also (I have access to the apt logs). It's listening on a UDP port if that is of significance.

This is the script running on the server.

#!/bin/sh
(echo "Hello World"; cat) | nc -ul 3456


All the searching I have done tells me how to set up shell access using netcat using -e.

Assistant: I you look at:

you can see that there are possibilities, if you are unable to alter the execution, it may be harder.

Note that it requires root, since you need to make a named pipe for sending raw terminal input to the other machine.
