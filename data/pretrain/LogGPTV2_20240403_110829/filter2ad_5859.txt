ABSTRACT
Notwithstanding the latest buzzwords (grid, cloud, utility
computing, SaaS, etc.), large-scale computing and cloud-
like deployment are the fastest growing computing infras-
tructures today. How exactly they will look like tomorrow
is still for the markets to decide, yet one thing has already
been identiﬁed: clouds have new, untested deployment, as-
sociated adversarial models and vulnerabilities and hence a
very diﬀerent threat landscape. It is essential that our com-
munity becomes involved in shaping the future security of
cloud computing. The CCSW workshop aims to bring to-
gether researchers and practitioners in all security and pri-
vacy aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing.

INTRODUCTION
Cloud computing is the fastest growing, large-scale in-
dustry trend. However, cloud computing also entails a new
threat landscape than traditional computing paradigms. The
CCSW workshop has had signiﬁcant impact in the research
community and tries to aim at a catalyst for new ideas in
cloud computing security and privacy.
Cloud computing security and privacy has brought along
a number of new threats and protection measures. Among
those are secure virtualization, integrity veriﬁcation and com-
puting on encrypted data.
Secure Virtualization: Cloud computing infrastructures
heavily rely on virtualization and co-location as a means
to increase utilization. Multi-tenancy – the common use of
resources such as processor, operating system or database

among multiple clients – is a core concept in cloud comput-
ing. However, in order to achieve levels of security simi-
lar to traditional computing separation controls need to be
in place.
If one tenant can access the data from another
tenant, this entails very new security risks. However, com-
pletely separating processes that share resources is hard, if
not impossible. From multi-user computer systems security
research is well acquainted with the topic of side and covert
channels. We have seen this topic arise again in the era of
cloud computing where one OS tenant could snoop the key
of another OS tenant on the same physical machine. Com-
mon controls in security research include information ﬂow
policies, such as mandatory access control.
Integrity Veriﬁcation: When computing is outsourced how
does the client know that the result is trustworthy? Integrity
veriﬁcation techniques can help ensure trustworthiness. Re-
cently, veriﬁable computation has seen a spike in interest,
since it was possible to signiﬁcantly reduce the time to ver-
ify the result. Most importantly, result veriﬁcation can be
performed in constant time, such that the eﬀect of outsourc-
ing the computation is not annihilated. Next to veriﬁcation
of computation veriﬁcation of storage (and retrieval results)
is an important topic. Often, it is not possible to retrieve the
entire stored data for veriﬁcation. For this purpose, proofs
of retrievability and provable data possession have been in-
troduced. These allow to check whether the cloud service
provider stores the entire data with low local storage.
Computing on Encrypted Data: Besides integrity conﬁ-
dentiality is another important issue in cloud computing.
The holy grail is to entirely compute on encrypted data in
the cloud, such that no decryption operation needs to be
performed. While fully homomorphic encryption promises
this, its performance hinders practical adoption. The much
faster multi-party secure computation requires to split the
computation among multiple, mutually distrustful parties,
which is a security concept that is not widely deployed. In-
dustrial solutions based on tokenization or deterministic en-
cryption ﬁll the void. They come with the signiﬁcant advan-
tage that existing applications only require minimal changes.
Nonetheless, their security remains debatable and lacking of
academic standards. A step further goes symmetric search-
able encryption with a much stronger security model, yet
very acceptable performance.
These topics are only to provide a glimpse of security and
privacy issues in cloud computing. They are here to serve
as examples of the techniques and problems are discussed at
the CCSW workshop.

The CCSW workshop brings together researchers and prac-
titioners in all security and privacy aspects of cloud-centric
and outsourced computing. The organizers especially en-
courage novel paradigms and controversial ideas that are
not on the list of topics. The workshop is to act as a fer-
tile ground for creative debate and interaction in security-
sensitive areas of computing impacted by clouds.
em List of topics:
• practical cryptographic protocols for cloud security
• outsourced privacy-preserving computation
• secure cloud resource virtualization mechanisms
• secure data management outsourcing (e.g., database
as a service)
• practical privacy and integrity mechanisms for out-
sourcing
• privacy-enhancing technologies for the cloud
• foundations of cloud-centric threat models
• secure computation outsourcing
• remote attestation mechanisms in clouds
• sandboxing and VM-based enforcements
• trust and policy management in clouds
• secure identity management mechanisms
• new cloud-aware web service security paradigms and
mechanisms
• cloud-centric regulatory compliance issues and mecha-
nisms
• business and security risk models and clouds
• cost and usability models and their interaction with
security in clouds
• scalability of security in global-size clouds
• trusted computing technology and clouds
• binary analysis of software for remote attestation and
cloud protection
• network security (DOS, IDS etc.) mechanisms for cloud
contexts
• security for emerging cloud programming models
• energy/cost/eﬃciency of security in clouds
• security for software deﬁned networking
3. PROGRAM
The 2015 ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW
2015) was held on October 16, 2015 in Denver, Colorado,
USA in conjunction with the 22nd ACM CCS Conference.
We received a total of twenty-one high quality submissions,
out of which six were selected by the program committee
through a rigorous reviewing process. We are delighted to
have three keynote talks that bring new perspectives and
practical problems from industry to the research commu-
nity related to issues like security and privacy of data stored
in the cloud, economic impact of security, and risk manage-
ment in cloud settings. The three invited speakers are:
• Mike Reiter (University of North Carolina, USA)
• Chenxi Wang (Ciphercloud, USA)
• Bruce Grenfell (Concur / SAP, USA)
