User: What is required to make the transition to Python 3.x for Google App Engine?
I know Google App Engine requires the use of at least Python 2.5.
Is it possible to use Python 3.0 already on Google App Engine?
Assistant: The app.yaml syntax already supports multiple languages and multiple API versions, though only one of each (Python, API version 1) is currently supported. Presumably, one of those extension mechanisms will be used to specify that you want Python 3, and it'll be up to you to port your app over to work in Python 3, then change that setting.
