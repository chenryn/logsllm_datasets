# Phishing investigation
This article provides guidance on identifying and investigating phishing attacks within your organization. The step-by-step instructions will help you take the required remedial action to protect information and minimize further risks.
This article contains the following sections:
- **Prerequisites:** Covers the specific requirements you need to complete before starting the investigation. For example, logging that should be turned on, roles and permissions required, among others.
- **Workflow:** Shows the logical flow that you should follow to perform this investigation.
- **Checklist:** Contains a list of tasks for each of the steps in the flow chart. This checklist can be helpful in highly regulated environments to verify what you have done or simply as a quality gate for yourself.
- **Investigation steps:** Includes a detailed step-by-step guidance for this specific investigation.
## Prerequisites
Here are general settings and configurations you should complete before proceeding with the phishing investigation.
### Account details
Before proceeding with the investigation, it is recommended that you have the user name, user principal name (UPN) or the email address of the account that you suspect is compromised.
### Microsoft 365 base requirements
#### Verify auditing settings
Verify that *mailbox auditing on by default* is turned on by running the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):
```powershell
Get-OrganizationConfig | Format-List AuditDisabled
```
The value **False** indicates that mailbox auditing is enabled for all mailboxes in the organization, regardless of the value of the *AuditEnabled* property on individual mailboxes. For more information, see [Verify mailbox auditing on by default is turned on](/microsoft-365/compliance/enable-mailbox-auditing#verify-mailbox-auditing-on-by-default-is-turned-on).
### Message trace
Message trace logs are invaluable components that help to find the original source of the message as well as the intended recipients. You can use the *message trace* functionality in Exchange admin center (EAC) at  or with the [Get-MessageTrace](/powershell/module/exchange/mail-flow/get-messagetrace) cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell.
> [!NOTE]
> Message trace is also available in the Microsoft Defender portal at  under **Email & collaboration** \> **Exchange message trace**, but that's just a passthrough link to message trace in the EAC.
Several components of the *message trace* functionality are self-explanatory but *Message-ID* is a unique identifier for an email message and requires thorough understanding. To get the *Message-ID* for an email of interest, you need to examine the raw email headers.
### Audit log search
You search the [unified audit log](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance) to view all the activities of the user and admin in your Microsoft 365 organization.
### Are the sign-in logs and/or audit logs exported to an external system?
Since most of the Microsoft Entra ID [sign-in](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins) and audit data will get overwritten after 30 or 90 days, we recommend that you leverage Sentinel, Azure Monitor or an external security information and event management (SIEM) system.
## Roles and permissions required
### Permissions in Microsoft Entra ID
We recommend membership in the following roles for the account that does the investigation:
- [Global Reader](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#global-reader)
- [Security Reader](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#security-reader)
- As a last resort, you can always fall back to the role of a [Global Administrator / Company Administrator](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#global-administrator--company-administrator)
### Permissions in Microsoft 365
Generally speaking, the [Global Reader](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#global-reader) or the [Security Reader](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/permissions-microsoft-365-compliance-security#security-reader) role groups in the Microsoft Defender portal or the Microsoft Purview compliance portal should give you sufficient permissions to search the relevant logs.
> [!NOTE]
> Accounts that are members of the **View-Only Audit Logs** or **Audit Logs** role groups only in the the Microsoft Defender portal or the Microsoft Purview compliance portal won't be able to search the Microsoft 365 audit log. In this scenario, you must assign permissions in Exchange Online. For more information, see [Before you search the audit log](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance#before-you-search-the-audit-log).
if you're unsure about the role groups to use, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
If you have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), you should leverage it for this flow. For more information, see [Tackling phishing with signal-sharing and machine learning](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/12/19/tackling-phishing-with-signal-sharing-and-machine-learning/).
## System requirements
### Hardware requirements
The system should be able to run PowerShell.
### Software requirements
The following PowerShell modules are required for the investigation of the cloud environment:
- Azure AD PowerShell for Graph module. For installation instructions, see [Install Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0&preserve-view=true).
  If you need older cmdlets in the MSOnline (v1) Azure AD module, see [Microsoft Entra ID (MSOnline)](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-msonlinev1).
- Exchange Online PowerShell module: For installation instructions, see [Install and maintain the Exchange Online PowerShell module](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2#install-and-maintain-the-exchange-online-powershell-module).
- Microsoft Entra Incident Response PowerShell module: For installation instructions, see [Microsoft Entra Incident Response PowerShell Module](https://github.com/AzureAD/Azure-AD-Incident-Response-PowerShell-Module)

## Checklist
This checklist will help you evaluate your investigation process and verify whether you have completed all the steps during investigation:
|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
|---|---|
||Review initial phishing email|
||Get the list of users who got this email|
||Get the latest dates when the user had access to the mailbox|
||Is delegated access configured on the mailbox?|
||Are there forwarding rules configured on the mailbox?|
||Review your Exchange mail flow rules (transport rules|
||Find the email messages|
||Did the user read or open the email?|
||Who else got the same email?|
||Did the email contain an attachment?|
||Was there a payload in the attachment?|
||Check email header for true source of the sender|
||Verify IP addresses to attackers/campaigns|
||Did the user click links in the email?|
||On what endpoint was the email opened?|
||Was the attachment payload executed?|
||Was the destination IP or URL touched or opened?|

You can also download the phishing and other incident playbook checklists as an [Excel file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/2/9/a/29a32dc4-d126-42af-a825-ffb944135a50/Incident-Response-Playbook-Checklists.xlsx).
## Investigation steps
For this investigation, it is assumed that you either have a sample phishing email, or parts of it like the sender's address, subject of the email, or parts of the message to start the investigation. Also make sure that you have completed / enabled all settings as recommended in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
This playbook is created with the intention that not all Microsoft customers and their investigation teams will have the full Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Entra ID P2 license suite available or configured in the tenant that is being investigated. We will however highlight additional automation capabilities when appropriate.
### Get the list of users / identities who got the email
As the very first step, you need to get a list of users / identities who received the phishing email. The objective of this step is to record a list of potential users / identities that you'll later use to iterate through for additional investigation steps. Refer to the [Workflow](#workflow) section for a high-level flow diagram of the steps you need to follow during this investigation.
We do not give any recommendations in this playbook on how you want to record this list of potential users / identities. Depending on the size of the investigation, you can leverage an Excel book, a CSV file, or even a database for larger investigations. There are multiple ways to obtain the list of identities in a given tenant, and here are some examples.
### Create a Content search in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal
Use the indicators that you've collected to create and run a Content search. For instructions, see [Create a content search](/microsoft-365/compliance/content-search#create-a-search).
For a full list of searchable email properties, see [searchable email properties](/microsoft-365/compliance/keyword-queries-and-search-conditions#searchable-email-properties).
The following example returns messages that were received by users between April 13, 2022 and April 14, 2022 and that contain the words "action" and "required" in the subject line:
```SearchFilter
(Received:4/13/2022..4/14/2022) AND (Subject:'Action required')
```
The following example query returns messages that were sent by `PI:EMAIL` and that contain the exact phrase "*Update your account information*" in the subject line.
```SearchFilter
(From:PI:EMAIL) AND (Subject:"Update your account information")
```
For more information, see how to [search for and delete messages in your organization](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-for-and-delete-messages-in-your-organization).
#### Use the Search-Mailbox cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell
You can also use the **Search-Mailbox** cmdlet in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to perform a specific query against a target mailbox of interest and copy the results to an unrelated destination mailbox.
The following example query searches Jane Smith mailbox for an email that contains the phrase Invoice in the subject and copies the results to IRMailbox in a folder named "Investigation."
```powershell
Search-Mailbox -Identity "Jane Smith" -SearchQuery "Subject:Invoice" -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" LogLevel Full
```
In this example command, the query searches all tenant mailboxes for an email that contains the phrase "InvoiceUrgent" in the subject and copies the results to IRMailbox in a folder named "Investigation."
```powershell
Get-Mailbox | Search-Mailbox -SearchQuery 'InvoiceUrgent vote' -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Search-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailbox).
### Is delegated access configured on the mailbox?
Use the following script to check whether delegated access is configured on the mailbox: .
To create this report, run a small PowerShell script that gets a list of all your users. Then, use the Get-MailboxPermission cmdlet to create a CSV file of all the mailbox delegates in your tenancy.
Look for unusual names or permission grants. If you see something unusual, contact the mailbox owner to check whether it is legitimate.
### Are there forwarding rules configured for the mailbox?
You need to check each identified mailbox for mailbox forwarding (also known as *SMTP forwarding*) or Inbox rules that forward email messages to external recipients (typically, newly-created Inbox rules).
- To check all mailboxes for mailbox forwarding, run the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):
  ```powershell
  Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Format-Table -Auto MicrosoftOnlineServicesID,ForwardingSmtpAddress,DeliverToMailboxAndForward | Export-csv C:\Temp\Forwarding.csv -NoTypeInformation
  ```
- To check for Inbox rules that were created in mailboxes between the specified dates, run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell:
  ```powershell
