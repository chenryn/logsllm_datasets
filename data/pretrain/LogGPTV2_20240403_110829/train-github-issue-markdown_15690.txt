### Analysis
The error `0xe8008015` typically indicates a problem with the provisioning profile or the signing certificate. This could be due to several reasons:
- The provisioning profile is invalid or expired.
- The device is not included in the provisioning profile.
- The signing certificate is not properly configured.

### Recommendations
1. **Check Provisioning Profile:**
   - Ensure that the provisioning profile is valid and not expired.
   - Verify that the device (iPad with device ID `b0f7081e6f02d7e3b573bf6afcb64e61ed8b86bb`) is included in the provisioning profile.

2. **Signing Certificate:**
   - Ensure that the signing certificate is correctly configured in Xcode.
   - If necessary, create a new signing certificate and update the project settings.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:**
   - Clean the build directory and rebuild the project.
     ```sh
     cd ios
     pod deintegrate
     pod install
     cd ..
     flutter clean
     flutter run
     ```

4. **Xcode Configuration:**
   - Open the project in Xcode and check for any warnings or errors related to signing and provisioning.

By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the deployment error and successfully run the application on the iPad.
