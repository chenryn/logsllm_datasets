Figure 5: Analysis of abnormal sellers.
5% of the bidders in his auctions was 2%, while the winning rate
of all bidders on his auction was 13%. This classiﬁes 672 as abnor-
mal with respect to the P model (Figure 5c). The top two bidders
participated in ﬁfteen of the twenty auctions but won none of them.
We found that these two bidders were exclusively buyers—they bid
on items but never sold items on eBay. These bidders also usually
placed bids at about 90% of the ﬁnal price. Again, this behavior is
consistent with shilling.
Seller 7578 sold laptop batteries and posted 439 auctions, 248 of
which ended with at least one bid. The winning rate of the top 5%
of the bidders in his auctions was 14%, while the average winning
rate across all other bidders was 40%. This classiﬁes seller 7578
as abnormal with respect to the P model (Figure 5d). Two top bid-
ders participated in forty auctions but won only one auction. The
ﬁrst bidder usually bid up to 90% of the ﬁnal price while the sec-
ond bidder only bid very early in the auction, usually with a small
bid. These two bidders are both exclusively buyers; they only buy
on eBay. The abnormality of 7578 with respect to N (Figure 5b)
can be explained by a normal M (Figure 5c). Overall, the only
evidence for price inﬂation is the existence of the two exclusive
buyers. Although these buyers may not be fraudulent, na¨ıve buyers
have reduced chances to ﬁnd bargains from this seller.
We hypothesize that an inexperienced buyer has diminished op-
portunities to get a bargain from a seller identiﬁed as abnormal with
respect to at least two of our models:
• In the auctions posted by each of these abnormal sellers, we ob-
served bidding behavior consistent with shilling. For each of
these sellers, there was a different set of bidders who repeatedly
participated and lost in his auctions.
• Using an informal survey, we estimated that the ﬁnal prices in
these auctions were close to prices at other online stores, includ-
ing reputable retailers.
• For at least one seller, 7504, we found a bidder whose activity
was highly suggestive of shilling. This bidder bid early and al-
ways at the same price. As a result, the ﬁnal price of the item
sold was higher than the price of similar items found on eBay.
Interestingly, we note that the eBay reputations of these four
sellers were overwhelmingly positive—on average, these sellers re-
ceived 98.7% positive feedback. However, as these sellers are so
abnormal with respect to other sellers, as determined by our repu-
tation system, an inexperienced buyer is well-advised to bid else-
where.
6. THREAT ANALYSIS
We now consider the techniques a malicious seller could use to
appear normal in our reputation system. Our system uses anomaly
detection to identify sellers who have price-inﬂated auctions, pos-
sibly due to shilling. A malicious seller may try to lower his reputa-
tion scores so that they are in the normal ranges of our models. We
say that such a seller attempts to normalize his reputation scores.
We examine how a seller can normalize his N , M, or P score.
We restrict ourselves to the case where the seller normalizes exactly
one of these scores; cases where a seller attempts to normalize more
than one score are left for future work.
6.1 Normalizing an N Score
A seller is classiﬁed as anomalous according to N if his auctions
attract more bids than the auctions of other sellers selling the same
product. Therefore, to normalize the N score, the seller must re-
duce the number of bids in his auctions. We consider three ways in
which a malicious seller could achieve this goal:
Using fewer shill bids per auction. We assumed that a mali-
cious seller used fraudulent shill bidders to elevate the prices of
his auctions. To reduce the average number of bids, the malicious
seller could use fewer shill bids per auction. We note that while us-
ing fewer shill bids does not eliminate shilling activity, it limits the
seller’s ability to inﬂate prices. Thus, a malicious seller who uses
fewer shill bids per auction to defeat our reputation system will be
unable to inﬂate prices as desired.
Creating a new identity. A malicious seller could create a new
identity, thus starting with an empty proﬁle in our system. Be-
cause a new identity does not have a reputation score, including
feedback-based reputation as used by eBay, the seller will attract
fewer buyers (as shown by recent research [1, 9, 24]). This reduces
the average number of bids in the seller’s auctions. Thus, shill bids
employed by the seller may not increase the average number of bids
above the normality line for N .
While this technique helps the seller stay within the normal range
of N , losing a good feedback-based reputation translates into lost
proﬁts [9, 14, 25]. The malicious seller must decide between los-
ing his old identity, which had a good feedback-based reputation
but a poor reputation according to our system, and starting afresh.
This example serves to demonstrate how our reputation system can
complement a feedback-based reputation system.
Adding shill bids to auctions of other sellers. In a classical
poisoning attack, an attacker alters the deﬁnition of “normal” to
include his behavior by poisoning the data used by the anomaly
detection system to compute normality. A malicious seller could
alter the N model by adding shill bids to auctions of other sell-
ers at a level not expected to win. Sufﬁcient change in the overall
average may make the malicious seller’s behavior appear normal.
To shill bid at a level high enough to sufﬁciently alter the average
number of bids, the attacker must place a large number of bids in
a large number of auctions. The attacker risks winning many auc-
tions, particularly because eBay auctions regularly end with no bids
and the malicious seller would be the only buyer bidding on many
items. Although a poisoning attack is certainly possible, we believe
that it is unlikely to succeed without high ﬁnancial cost.
6.2 Normalizing an M Score
M classiﬁes a seller as anomalous if the average number of bids
in his auctions is higher than the average predicted by the mini-
mum starting bids set by the seller. To normalize his M score, a
malicious seller has two options:
• He can try to decrease the average number of bids in his auction
using the techniques discussed in Section 6.1.
• He can decrease his minimum starting bids so that the number of
bids on his auctions matches the average predicted by M.
Reducing the minimum starting bid alone does not ensure that
M will classify a seller as normal. As Figure 3 demonstrates,
there is a positive correlation between the minimum starting bid
and the number of bids in an auction: the lower the minimum start-
ing bid the more bids the auction gets. As the malicious seller
lowers his starting bids, the average number of bids in his auc-
tions will increase correspondingly; consequently, the seller still
remains anomalous. It may be possible to develop a mathematical
model that helps a malicious seller determine the minimum starting
bid that would keep his M score within the normal range. Such a
model is currently beyond the scope of this paper. We further note
that reducing the minimum starting bid is not an option for sellers
who already start their auctions at low prices.
6.3 Normalizing a P Score
A seller is classiﬁed as abnormal with respect to P if the seller’s
cumulative bidder presence curve is above the normal bidder pres-
ence curve at the 10% mark and the gap between the cumulative
bidder presence curve and the cumulative bidder wins curve is sta-
tistically high. To normalize his P score, an attacker should (a)
lower the cumulative bidder presence curve so that it falls below
the normal bidder presence curve, or (b) reduce the gap between
the cumulative bidder presence curve and the cumulative bidder
win curve. We consider two techniques a seller may use to achieve
these goals.
Distributing shill bids. The seller may collude with more bid-
ders and distribute the shill bids between the expanded set of bid-
ders. Distributing the shill bids of a single bidder b among many
bidders reduces b’s bidder presence. Therefore, the cumulative bid-
der presence curve of the seller is shifted towards the normal bidder
presence curve. We however note that distributing shill bids among
a larger group of bidders does not affect N and M and the seller
will have to normalize these metrics as well.
Letting some shill bidders win. To reduce the gap between the
cumulative bidder presence curve and the cumulative bidder wins
curve, the seller could occasionally let some of the shills win. This
technique may not be economically appealing to the seller because
the seller must pay a fee to the auction house for each success-
ful auction. While we believe that a seller is unlikely to resort to
this technique, it may be interesting to formally analyze this tech-
nique using an economic model, such as the model of Kauffman
and Wood [16].
7. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a new reputation system to rank sellers in on-
line auction houses such as eBay. Our reputation system addresses
a concern that is ignored by current reputation systems: identifying
sellers who seem to inﬂate their prices. We used a combination of
statistical modeling and automatic anomaly detection to rank sell-
ers and to identify suspicious sellers who use tactics consistent with
artiﬁcial price inﬂation. We demonstrated the efﬁcacy and practi-
cality of our ideas by building a reputation system and using it on
real-world data gathered from eBay. We showed how our repu-
tation system identiﬁed a small group of anomalous sellers. We
manually analyzed these sellers’ auctions and found evidence that
their auctions are price-inﬂated. Our ﬁndings also revealed that
eBay’s reputation system assigned a high reputation to the sellers
we identiﬁed as anomalous, showing that our system offers new
information to potential bidders.
