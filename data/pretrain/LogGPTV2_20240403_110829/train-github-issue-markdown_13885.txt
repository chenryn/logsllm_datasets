Hello,  
I'm trying to install from scratch of Apache Superset but I get this error
which is stopping the installation:  
ERROR: flask 1.1.4 has requirement itsdangerous=0.24, but you'll have
itsdangerous 2.0.1 which is incompatible.  
ERROR: flask-appbuilder 3.3.2 has requirement Flask-WTF=0.14.2, but
you'll have flask-wtf 0.15.1 which is incompatible.
It looks that the Superset version has downloaded (pip install command) is
1.2.0 and the version of the itsdangerous installed is 2.0.1
Please could you help to resolve this issue?  
I don't know how to go ahead and fix the problem.  
Thanks  
Matteo
