  * VSCode Version: 1.0.0
  * OS Version: Mac OS 10.11.4
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Create the following `package.json` file and open it in Code: `{ "private": true }`
  2. View the linter warnings (hover over the green squiggles)
## Expected
No warnings, because `npm install` no longer warns about missing names and
versions in private packages.
## Actual
Code produces the following warnings:
  * Missing property "name"
  * Missing property "version"
