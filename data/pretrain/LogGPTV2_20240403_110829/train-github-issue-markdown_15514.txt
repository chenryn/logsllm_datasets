I don't think that the spell-check package is doing anything wrong here, so I
assume that this visual bug is due to decorations stretching across soft-wrap
boundaries when maybe they shouldn't:

_(As a side note, I'm impressed that supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is in
the OS X dictionary. I had to come up with another long nonsense word ðŸ˜†)_
I would expect that "absafragginglutely" would be decorated, but _not_ the
space between "absafragginglutely" and the previous instance of the word
"testing".
