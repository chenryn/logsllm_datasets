Ad exchanges like DoubleClick do not check for the domain in
which the re-marketing script is being executed. Consequently, it is
sufﬁcient for the polluter to simply copy the JavaScript provided by
the ad exchange. To prevent this, the re-marketing script provided
by the ad exchange should be bound to the designated domain, and
at runtime the script should verify that it indeed runs within the
intended domain.
A few ad exchanges and ad networks provide users the ability to
inspect and modify the inferred online interest proﬁle or opt out of
personalized ads [4, 5, 7, 13, 14]. However, users have no visibil-
ity into how these proﬁles are generated or used to serve targeted
ads [29]. Ad exchanges and ad networks should provide users easy
mechanisms to ﬂag suspicious ads they see that are not aligned with
their real interests. Additionally, ad exchanges should also encour-
age users to manually adjust their online interests, and explicitly
avoid being targeted in some categories. For example, a user might
want to disallow all Health related ads. In such a case, a polluter
attempting to inﬂuence the user’s proﬁle with the Health category
would lead to no ads from this category to be targeted at the user.
A key contributor to the success of the attack is that pollution
content immediately impacts the user proﬁle, thus the polluter can
almost immediately beneﬁt from the attack. The ad networks can
increase the duration between page visits and the impact on the
user’s proﬁle, thus mitigating the impact of the attack by proﬁl-
ing users interests across a large set of websites visted by the user.
However, this delay might be in contrast to the ad networks’ desire
for accurate and timely inference of user interests, especially for
re-marketing campaigns.
8. RELATED WORK
Online Advertising Economy and Tracking. The economics of
online advertising is discussed in detail in [23], which considers
the usage of targeting users based on interests as a key difference
between traditional and online advertising. More recently, Gill et
al. [25] proposed a simple model for capturing the effect of user
proﬁle (or “intent”) on the revenue obtained by the ad network and
the publishers. Using this model the authors stressed the signiﬁ-
cance of the user proﬁle in the ecosystem by showing that incor-
porating mechanisms that block tracking, thereby essentially elim-
inating targeted advertising, can decrease the overall revenue of ad
networks by 75%.
In order to build an accurate user proﬁle, ad networks need to
track users as they browse the web. Several recent papers measure
the extent to which users are being tracked and targeted by ad net-
works [29,30,33]. Rosner et al. [33] showed that online tracking of
users is ubiquitous and covers a large fraction of a user’s browsing
behavior. Liu et al. [29] focused on Google’s DoubleClick network
and showed that interest-based targeting is prominent and spans
multiple ad categories, with up to 65% of the ad categories received
by a user are targeted based on the user’s inferred proﬁle.
In this work we leverage the strong relation between the user in-
terest proﬁle and the economics of online advertising to propose
a method for polluting user interest proﬁle for increasing the pub-
lisher’s revenue.
Pollution Attacks. Pollution attacks against users have been shown
to be useful for a variety of attacks, including inﬂuencing prod-
uct recommendations on Amazon and video recommendations on
YouTube [39]. While these attacks were shown to be useful in in-
ﬂuencing the way users interact with the polluted system, it is not
clear whether the polluter can actually gain monetary beneﬁts from
the attack. Our work is the ﬁrst application of a pollution attack
that leads to clear monetary value to the attacker.
Fraud in Online Advertising. Fraud in online advertising and
countermeasures against these fraud mechanisms have been the fo-
cus of a long line of research efforts [8,16,17,20,21,31,35–38]. The
most common fraudulent activities include those where fraudulent
publishers leverage click-spam networks or pay-per-view networks
to increase the trafﬁc to their sites, and thus increase their ad rev-
enue. Click-spam networks cause fraudulent clicks on ads in order
to increase the income of the publisher or sometimes deplete the
budget of the advertiser. The most recently study by [21], where the
authors conducted a controlled experiment show that click-spam
attacks account for 10–25% of the clicks, highlighting the promi-
nence of such attacks.
In a recent study, the authors used these
results and presented a system [22] that ad networks can use for
catching click-spam in search ad networks.
Different from click-spam networks are pay-per-view networks
that artiﬁcially increase the number of ad impressions of fraudulent
publishers by framing the publisher’s website within other websites
in a camouﬂaged fashion. Fraudulent activities using pay-per-view
networks typically result in impressions that are registered on the
camouﬂaged pages without “genuine user interest” i.e., invalid traf-
ﬁc generation. A recent study [35] have shown a pay-per-view net-
work generates hundreds of millions of fraudulent impressions per
day.
Existing online advertising frauds focus solely on increasing the
volume of ad clicks or impressions and have largely ignored the
impact of user proﬁles. Our attack complements these existing
fraud mechanisms by enabling the publisher to further boost the
revenue obtained by participating in either of the networks. Com-
pared to existing fraudulent activities which are suspect to trafﬁc
analysis [35, 40], our attack is more resilient against current fraud
detection methods.
9. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a new pollution attack on online targeted ad-
vertising that exploits the role played by the online interest proﬁle
of users in the ad selection process. The attack leverages novel
mechanisms to pollute the proﬁle of users visiting a publisher page
in a way that deceives the ad exchange and advertisers to target
more lucrative ads, thereby increasing the publisher’s revenue. The
proposed attack is validated and characterized for the two most
commonly used ad targeting mechanisms (re-marketing and behav-
ioral targeting) by emulating a real world deployment. The study
shows that the proﬁle pollution based attack is robust against di-
verse browsing patterns and online interests of users, and effective
in drawing the intended higher-paying ads resulting in a signiﬁcant
increase in ad revenue.
