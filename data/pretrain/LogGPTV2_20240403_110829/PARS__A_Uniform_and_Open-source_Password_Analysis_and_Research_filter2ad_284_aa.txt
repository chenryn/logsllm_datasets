ABSTRACT
In this paper, we introduce an open-source and modular
password analysis and research system, PARS, which pro-
vides a uniform, comprehensive and scalable research plat-
form for password security. To the best of our knowledge,
PARS is the ﬁrst such system that enables researchers to
conduct fair and comparable password security research.
PARS contains 12 state-of-the-art cracking algorithms, 15
intra-site and cross-site password strength metrics, 8 aca-
demic password meters, and 15 of the 24 commercial pass-
word meters from the top-150 websites ranked by Alexa.
Also, detailed taxonomies and large-scale evaluations of the
PARS modules are presented in the paper.

INTRODUCTION
Text-based passwords have been the dominating means of
computer system authentication for more than half a cen-
tury. Although several shortcomings of passwords have been
identiﬁed and extensively studied, passwords will likely re-
main as the primary computer authentication mechanism
for the foreseeable future because of their signiﬁcant advan-
tages, e.g., high scalability, portability, and performance-
price ratio, over their alternatives [1].
Over the past decade, password research has made consid-
erable progress in many perspectives, e.g., password crack-
ing, measurement, and security evaluation. On one hand,

such extensive research on a multitude of topics has signif-
icantly enhanced people’s comprehension of password secu-
rity. On the other hand, this extensive focus on password
security has made the status quo of password research dis-
parate and somewhat chaotic, which causes confusion and
makes it challenging to understand the current state of pass-
word security research. This is partly because much of the
research has been conducted across diﬀerent platforms with
various settings which can make it challenging to accurately
and fairly compare experimental results. For instance, which
password cracking algorithm/tool is the most eﬃcient in
which scenario? How should password policies be created?
How is passwords’ strength accurately measured? How help-
ful and what is the eﬀectiveness of password strength met-
rics and meters? What is the performance of commercial
password meters?
Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to conduct com-
parable research on a uniform and comprehensive platform
where bias can be reduced and conclusions can be more per-
suasive. Aiming at this, in this paper, we make the following
contributions.
(1) We propose and implement PARS, an open-source
and modular Password Analysis and Research System, to
provide a uniform and comprehensive research platform for
password security. (downloadable at [2]). To the best of our
knowledge, PARS is the ﬁrst such platform in the password
research area that enables researchers to conduct fair and
comparable password cracking, measurement, and evalua-
tion studies.
(2) We systematically analyze and implement 12 state-of-
the-art password cracking algorithms. Leveraging ∼ 115M
real-world passwords, we evaluate the implemented algo-
rithms in multiple scenarios. Based on our evaluation re-
sults, no cracking algorithm is optimal in all scenarios. The
performance of an algorithm depends on multiple factors,
e.g., algorithm design, target data, training data.
(3) We systematically analyze, implement, and evaluate
15 intra-site and cross-site password strength metrics, 8 aca-
demic password meters, and 15 of the 24 commercial pass-
word meters from the top-150 websites (ranked by Alexa,
http://www.alexa.com/). According to our analysis and
evaluation, most academic password metrics and meters are
useful in helping system administrators estimate the secu-
rity of passwords. However, for commercial password me-
ters, their results are very inconsistent and their perfor-
mance varies signiﬁcantly. Moreover, some commercial me-
ters are inaccurate and ineﬀective in guiding users to choose
secure passwords. To make things worse, the feedback of
some commercial meters may lead users to choose vulnera-
ble passwords.
(4) We propose and implement a new metric, namely Rel-
ative Improvement Ratio (RIR), which quantitatively eval-
uates the relative performance of a password cracking al-
gorithm over another in the same cracking setup. By the
RIR analysis, PARS users can gain a more thorough un-
derstanding of the relationships between password cracking
algorithms. With this analysis, RIR can also shed light on
the need for designing Hybrid Cracking Algorithms.
2. PARS: SYSTEM OVERVIEW
In general, PARS has three functional modules.
Password Dataset Analysis.
In this module, lever-
aging a large corpus (∼ 115M) of real-world passwords,
we develop several analytical functions to characterize pass-
word datasets by computing the distributions of passwords
in terms of length, structure, and composition. The strength
distribution of passwords in terms of speciﬁc metrics/meters
can also be computed by interacting with the correspond-
ing module in PARS. This module enables users/researchers
to conduct statistical analysis of password datasets. Fur-
thermore, to conduct uniform and comparable analysis, re-
searchers can construct standard datasets from the original
password datasets.
Password Crackability Evaluation. In this module,
we implement state-of-the-art password cracking algorithms,
including 7 academic password cracking algorithms proposed
after 2005. Using this module, users can evaluate the crack-
ability of password datasets under diﬀerent scenarios, which
enables them to comprehensively understand the vulnerabil-
ity of a password dataset. Researchers can also use this mod-
ule to uniformly and comparatively study the existing/newly
developed password cracking algorithms.
Password Strength Evaluation.
In this module, we
implement 15 strength metrics and 8 strength meters from
academia [3–11]. We also implement 15 of the 24 commercial
password meters with online and oﬄine versions, of the top-
15 websites in 10 categories (Business, Computers, Health,
Science, Shopping, Society, News, Sports, Kids&Teens, and
Home) ranked by Alexa. Using this module, users can eval-
uate the strength of passwords in terms of any academic
metric, meter, and/or commercial meter, which can help
them understand the security of their passwords. Further,
researchers can systematically study, evaluate and compare
the existing/newly developed metrics/meters.
PARS, as a uniform and open-source platform, can help
users gain meaningful insights on password security research.
Using PARS, we introduce and develop the Relative Im-
provement Ratio (RIR), a metric that provides a theoretical
quantiﬁcation on the relative performance of one password
cracking algorithm over another, which can shed light on the
feasibility of designing hybrid password cracking algorithms.
In the following sections, we present and discuss the de-
tailed implementation and evaluation of each module.
3. DATASETS AND ANALYSIS
Datasets.
In this section, we present the 8 employed
datasets as shown in Table 1 along with preliminary anal-
ysis. The datasets consist of about 115M real world pass-
words and cover several computer applications. They were
leaked due to various password leakage incidents [3, 10, 12].

In Table 1, 7k7k, Rockyou, and Gamigo are popular game
websites; CSDN is a resource sharing website for program-
mers; Duduniu is a website of Internet cafe service software;
Renren and LinkedIn are social networking services; and
Tianya is an Internet forum. According to [3, 10, 12], most
users of 7k7k, CSDN, Duduniu, Renren, and Tianya are Chi-
nese speaking users, most users of LinkedIn and Rockyou
are English speaking users, and most users of Gamigo are
German speaking users.
Ethical Discussion. Note that all the datasets in Table
1 are now publicly available. Further, these datasets have
been extensively used for multi-purpose and meaningful aca-
demic research [3,10,12–15]. Although these real world pass-
words provide valuable resources to researchers, they were
initially leaked illegally. Therefore, in this paper, we only
use these data for research purposes.
Datasets Analysis. Let L, U , D, and S be four sets of
characters to represent lower-case letters, upper-case letters,
digits, and special symbols, respectively. A password is Uni-
variate (Uni), Bivariate (Bi), Trivariate (Tri), or Qualvari-
ate (Qual) if it is composed of one, two, three, or four set(s)
of characters, respectively. Then, the password length, com-
position, and structure distributions (we focus on the top-10
popular password structures obtained in [10]) of the datasets
in Table 1 are shown in Table 2. From Table 2, we observe
that (i) the majority of passwords of all datasets have length
less than 12. Particularly, a signiﬁcant number of passwords
of most datasets have length less than 8. However, CSDN has
fewer passwords of length less than 8. This could be due to
the fact that it introduced a new password policy of mini-
mum password length of 8 while the website was live [10].
Thus, only a small amount of early users have passwords of
length less than 8; (ii) the majority of passwords of most
datasets are Uni and Bi. LinkedIn has more Tri and Qual
passwords than other datasets, which suggests it has more
stronger passwords with respect to composition complex-
ity; and (iii) diﬀerent datasets have very diﬀerent structure
distributions. Generally, 88.2% − 97.8% Chinese passwords
follow the 10 most popular password structures. As for the
English password datasets, 90% of Rockyou’s passwords fol-
low the 10 most popular password structures. However,
22.9% of LinkedIn’s passwords do not follow the 10 most
popular structures. An explanation could be that LinkedIn
is a career-oriented professional social network service, and
thus people pay more attention to their passwords. 41.8%
of Gamigo’s passwords also do not have the 10 most popu-
lar structures. This is mainly because the popular structure
conclusion in [10] is derived from analyzing Chinese and En-
glish passwords, which may not apply to the German pass-
word dataset Gamigo.
Standard Datasets. For our following evaluation and
quantiﬁcation, in order to guarantee the fairness and to re-
duce possible bias caused by dataset size diﬀerences, we ran-

domly and uniformly sample 2 million unique passwords as a
standard dataset from each original dataset. Consequently,
we obtain 8 standard datasets.
In the rest of this paper,
without speciﬁcation, we use the standard datasets for the
training in password crackability evaluation and other sce-
narios.
4. PASSWORD CRACKABILITY
4.1 Password Cracking Advances
In [16], Narayanan and Shmatikov proposed to use stan-
dard Markov modeling techniques to dramatically reduce the
search size of password space. In [7], Castelluccia et al. im-
proved the Markov model in [16]. They proposed to con-
struct an n-gram based Markov model, under which to de-
termine the probability of the next character, given the con-
