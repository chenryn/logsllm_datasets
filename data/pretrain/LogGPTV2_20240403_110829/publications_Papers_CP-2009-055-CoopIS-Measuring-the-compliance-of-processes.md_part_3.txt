5.3 Industrial Application
This section applies the sequence-based compliance analysis to the case study
introduced in Sect. 4 and compares the results with two existing approaches
availableinProM:“StructuralPrecision/Recall”and“FootprintSimilarity”.We
have chosen these two approaches since they are sometimes used to determine
the compliancebetweenmodels.We discussthe resultsofourstudyinSect.5.4.
Measuring Sequence-Based Compliance. Fig. 4 shows the starting point
for the compliance analysis in ProM: two WF-nets. The left-hand side model
portrays the reference model M , which was adopted from ITIL. Initially cre-
1
ated as an EPC in the ARIS toolset, it has been converted into a WF-net and
imported into ProM. The right-hand side model illustrates the as-is model M ,
3
which representsthe complaint handling process of the passengerairline.It was
extractedwiththeProMplugin“HeuristicMiner”[16]fromalogfilecontaining
4,650 cases and 44,006 events being observed over a period of one year.
To adapt the reference model to the needs of the airline, model M was cus-
1
tomized as follows. The activity Identify responsible employee was excluded be-
cause the activity was not recorded by the IS. The airline assumes that the
activities Inform customer and Preprocess incident may be executed in an ar-
bitrary order. As a result, the airline has agreed on a user-selected partition of
type exclusion (p¯ = {Identify responsible employee}) as well as on a partition
of type order (pˇ = {Inform customer, Preprocess incident}). Besides the user-
selected partitions, the left-hand side of Fig. 5 shows the granularity mapping.

2
found typical characteristics in the airline process discussed in Sect. 4: missing
and additional activities and activities with different levels of detail. For exam-
ple, the activity Prioritize incident is missing in model M and the activities

airline uses iterations: model M has cycles. Since the cycles are seen as quality

improvement,the limit for cycle unrolling is set to 1. This limit ensures that all
activities are considered but that the iteration of activities is not punished.
The right-hand side of Fig. 5 illustrates the results of our compliance anal-
ysis. Visible are the compliance degree and compliance maturity, which were

incident, Categorize incident, Identify account, Create incident record, Process

3
sequence of σ and σ with σ corresponds to Receive incident, Identify
1−1 1−1 3−1
account, Create incident record, Process incident, Close incident, the firing se-
quence compliance fsc(σ 3−1,σ 1−1,P,G) is 5. The firing sequence compliance
degree fscd(σ 3−1,σ 1−1,P,G) is 5 6. This means that the instance σ 3−1 of the
as-is process model follows the order of the reference model with an overlap
of 83%. The firing sequence compliance maturity fscm(σ 3−1,σ 1−1,P,G) is 15 1.
This means that only 45% of instance σ 1−1 prescribed by the reference model
arebeing followedby instance σ 3−1 of the as-isprocessmodel. The resultofthe
compliance degree of 82% indicates that the processes executed by the airline
correspondtothe recommendationsofthe referencemodel.We cansaythat,al-
thoughthe models M andM lookdifferent, the modelM is highly compliant
3 1 3
with reference model M . The compliance maturity of 52% indicates that there
1
are recommendations in reference model M which are not implemented by the

airline.Nonetheless, because of the maturity value of 52%we canconclude that
model M is also partially mature with reference model M .

Measuring Precision and Recall. In [24], the authors introduce the struc-
tural precision and recall. PrecisionS(M ,M ) is the fraction of connections in
1 2
M thatalsoappearinM .Ifthisvalueis1,theprecisionisthehighestbecause
2 1
all connections in the second model exist in the first model. RecallS(M ,M )
1 2
is the fraction of connections in M , which also appear in M . If the value is 1,
1 2
the recall is the highest because all connections in the first model exist in the
second model. To analyze the compliance, model M and M of our use case
1 3
need to be represented by a heuristic net. Therefore, we have converted model
M , originally represented by an EPC, into a Heuristic net using ProM. Since
1
the ProM plugin expects same labels, we have renamed the labels of model M
3
according to model M and carried out the mapping depicted in Fig. 5. The
1
structural precision obtained was 3% and the recall was 8%.
Measuring Causal Footprint. The causal footprint [26] is the second ap-
proach we have compared with our algorithm. The footprint identifies two re-
lationships between activities: look-back and look-ahead links. This paper does
not elaborate on the corresponding equation due to its complexity. We refer in-
terested readers to [26]. Since the analysis of the causal footprint is based on
comparing two EPCs, we have converted model M into an EPC using a con-
3
versionplugininProM.The mappingwasmanuallyperformedinaccordanceto
the mapping shown in Fig. 5. To analyze the causal footprint, the ProM plugin
“Footprint Similarity” was used and yielded a result of 27%.
5.4 Evaluation
Thissectiondiscussesthecompliancevalues,whichweyieldedinSect.5.3based
on the requirements from Sect. 4.
Precision and recall rely on the notion of equivalence and expect process
models, which need to be compared, to be equal in their structure. This is the
reason why the values obtained are relatively low: 3% and 8%, respectively.
Similar to our approach these two measures allow to analyze the compliance
from the perspectives compliance degree (i.e. precision) and compliance mature
(i.e. recall). By contrast the approach neither offers a mapping functionality
noraccountsforthe necessarycustomizationofthe referencemodel:orderingor
exclusionofactivities.Expressingthebehaviorofamodelintermsofconnections

cycleandneglectsthecontrolflowofprocessmodels.However,thesearerelevant
information when measuring the compliance with reference models.
The causal footprint also relies on the notion of equivalence. However, the
approachassumes that process models with different structures may be similar.
Therefore, the result of 27% is closer to the values obtained when using the
algorithm we have developed (i.e. 82% and 52%). Since the formula is symmet-
ric,measuringthe complianceofmodelM withmodel M orofmodelM with

withthe notionofequivalence butfailstomeetthe requirementsofdetermining
compliance from the perspectives degree and maturity. Like our approach the
notion of mapping is included. However, a non-injective mapping is not sup-
ported. Since the algorithm accounts for the ordering of activities, it partially
fulfills the requirements for customization of reference models. Nonetheless, it
does not account for the exclusion of activities. The authors [26] do not state
the behavior of their formula with respect to cycles.
Using algorithmswiththe notionofequivalence,wearetempted toinfer that
the processes are not compliant. In contrast to the sequence-based compliance,
the recall and precision and the causal footprint yield a value, which is little
