sell BTC ICO for XRP. We discover that all three offers were
filled by the same account rMyronEjVcAdqUvhzx4MaBDwBPSPCrDHYm,
who received the aforementioned BTC IOU tokens directly
from the issuer’s account. Additional evidence on social me-
dia reveals that the IOU issuer’s account is held by someone
named Myrone Bagalay.10 It becomes obvious that the offer
taker’s address, starting with rMyronE, must belong to the
same person.
By tracing the transaction history of the concerned ac-
counts, we notice that the two offer creators’ accounts re-
ceived their initial BTC IOU tokens through payments from
the offer taker. Furthermore, one offer creator’s account,
rU6m5F9c1eWGKBdLMy1evRwk34HuVc18Wg, was activated by the offer
taker’s account. Now we can safely assume that all the ac-
counts involved are controlled by that Myrone Bagalay, who
issued BTC IOU tokens and traded them at arbitrarily deter-
mined rates with himself.
What Myrone Bagalay did is completely legitimate within
the confines of XRPL. In fact, one of the key features of the
ledger is the flexibility to establish a closed economy with a
limited number of mutually-trusting users who can exchange
self-defined assets that are not necessarily acknowledged
outside the system. However, this makes it challenging to
gauge the true value transfer on XRPL, since an IOU token’s
price—which we proxy by its exchange rate against XRP—can
be easily inflated or deflated.
Additionally, privately-issued IOU tokens that are never
exchanged on the ledger, while seemingly worthless, might
be valuable to their transactors after all, should they reach
an agreement on those tokens’ value off the ledger. However,
there is no easy way to assess such value, and we leave the
analysis of IOUs to future work.
Summary. In summary, the throughput on XRPL during our
observation period appeared to be fraught with zero-value
transactions. We learned that both transaction volume and
token value on XRPL are highly manipulable. One must thus
fully understand the underlying measurement approach to
correctly interpret the resultant statistics.

As one might expect, XRP is by far the most used currency
on the ledger in terms of payment volume: 125 billion XRP
for seven months, or 586 million XRP per day.
The top 10 senders cover 53% of this volume, while the
top 10 receivers are the beneficiaries of 50% of the volume.
Payments from Ripple alone account for 7% (9 billion XRP)
of the XRP volume, largely due to transactions associated
with the monthly release of one billion XRP from escrows.
While the XRP release itself is captured through EscrowCreate
transactions, 90% of the released funds were unused and
returned to escrows for future release [47] through Payment
transactions. All other top accounts presented are held either
by exchanges, or, in rare cases, by accounts that were opened
by an exchange. Binance appears to be the most avid XRP
user, sending 15.2 billion and receiving 14.5 billion XRP during
the observation period.
The most popular IOU tokens for fiat currencies include
USD, EUR and CNY (Figure 10). Specifically, 328 million USD, 8
million EUR and 19 million CNY issued had positive exchange
rates against XRP. The average on-ledger exchange rates of
those three fiat currency tokens, irrespective of their issuers,
were 5.4 XRP/USD, 5.5 XRP/EUR and 0.7 XRP/CNY, largely in
accordance with the off-ledger exchange rates.9

6 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the results from the previous
sections and also answer the research questions presented in
Section 1 in light of our results.
6.1 Interpretation of the Throughput Values
Overall, we observe that the throughput on EOSIO has been
volatile since last November, the throughput on Tezos has
been very stable over time, and the throughput on XRPL
has been stable in general except during the spam episode.
A common factor between all blockchains is that the current
throughput is vastly lower than the alleged capacity even
during their utilization peaks, and is on average several orders
of magnitude lower. A similarity between EOSIO and XRPL
is that the maximum throughput was reached due to DoS
attacks on the network. Indeed, the maximum numbers of
transactions on EOSIO is due to the EIDOS coin airdrop,
while the peak on XRPL was due to the network being
spammed with payments. However, while the spam on XRPL
appeared to be anecdotal and lasted for roughly two months,
the spam attack on EOSIO is persistent and has continued for
over six months to date. That the increased throughput has
different implications for each network. While on XRPL the
consequences of such a spam attack are limited, on EOSIO
they forced the network to enter congestion mode, hindering
normal usage of the network as transactions become too
costly due to the elevated threshold for staking.
Unlike XRPL and EOSIO, Tezos has not seen any spam
attack and the level of utilization has been consistent, and
relatively low, across time. A majority of the throughput is
used for consensus, with most of the spikes in the number of
transactions due to baker payments, which are also related
to consensus.
6.2 Revisiting Research Questions
We now return to the research questions posed in Section 1
and seek to understand better how the different blockchains
are used in practice, by attempting to answer them based on
the data analysis we perform above.
RQ1: used throughput capacity. Although the maximum
throughput of all blockchains appears vastly lower than the
alleged capacity, the situation is not as simple for EOSIO
and XRPL. As previously discussed, EOSIO started to be
congested because of an airdrop, preventing regular users
to use the blockchain normally. During the attack against
XRPL, there were several reports of the network being con-
gested [5, 53], showing that although the claimed capacity
was much higher, the actual capacity might have maxed. Nev-
ertheless, it is yet unclear whether the congestion is mainly
due to the suboptimal design of blockchain protocols or the
physical constraint of participating nodes’ infrastructure. On
the other hand, Tezos has not yet come close to maximizing
its actual capacity.
RQ2: classifying actions. We made a generalized categoriza-
tion of transaction types. Some transaction types are com-
mon to all blockchains, such as peer-to-peer transactions
and account related transactions, while other types of trans-
actions are inherent to the particularities of the underlying
blockchain. While XRPL and Tezos contain easily identifiable
action types, making them easy to classify, EOSIO does not
have pre-defined action types and classifying actions requires
knowledge of the account receiving the action.
RQ3: identifying active blockchain participants. EOSIO has
named accounts which makes it easy to identify participants.
XRPL has optional names, which are registered by the most
active players such as exchanges. Tezos endorsements are
often created by bakers, who usually publicize their address
and are identifiable. However, there is no easy way to identify
participants in peer-to-peer transactions and doing so would
require using de-anonymization techniques [6, 23].
RQ4: detecting DoS and spam. The blockchains analyzed
are currently under-utilized and when spam occurs, their
utilization level increases significantly, as seen in Figure 3.
This makes DoS and spam attacks very easy to detect by
simply looking at the transactions, as we saw for EOSIO and
XRPL.
6.3 Transaction Fee Dilemma
Overall, we have seen that there is a dilemma between having
lower transactions fees, which induces spam, or having higher
transaction fees, which deters legitimate usage of the network.
One the one side, we have seen that both EOSIO and
XRPL have chosen to go with extremely low transaction fees,
which in both cases resulted in a very large amount of spam.
On the other side of the spectrum, Ethereum, which has
transaction fees based on supply and demand [59] has seen a
10-times increase in the fees, mainly because of an increase in
the utilization of decentralized finance protocols [25], making
it extremely difficult to use for regular users [41].
Ron et al. [45] are among the first to analyze transac-
tion graphs Bitcoin. Using on-chain transaction data with
more than 3 million different addresses, the authors find that
There has been work on both sides to improve the current
situation but, at the time of writing, no significant progress
has been made. Despite fee structure changes having been
proposed in XRPL [66], concerns are that a fee increase
discourages the engagement of legitimate users. In EOSIO,
despite the integration of a new rental market for CPU and
RAM [20], the current fee structure remains problematic, as
the network has now been congested for more than half a year,
making it hard to use for regular users. On the Ethereum
side of things, changes in the current pricing system to try
to reduce the transaction fees have been proposed [10] but
are still under discussion.
Overall, for a functional and sustainable blockchain system,
it is crucial to find a balanced transaction fee mechanism
that can make regular usage of the network affordable while
DoS attacks expensive [42].
7 RELATED WORK
Existing literature on transactional patterns and graphs on
blockchains has been largely focused on Bitcoin.
Revisiting Transactional Statistics of
High-scalability Blockchains
Mt. Gox was at the time by far the most used exchange,
covering over 80% of the exchange-related traffic.
Kondor et al. [29] focus on the wealth distribution in
Bitcoin and provided an overview of the evolution of various
metrics. They find that the Gini coefficient of the balance
distribution has increased quite rapidly and show that the
wealth distribution in Bitcoin is converging to a power law.
McGinn et al. [34] focus their work on visualizing Bitcoin
transaction patterns. At this point, in 2016, Bitcoin already
had more than 300 million addresses, indicating exponen-
tial growth over time. The authors propose a visualization
which scales well enough to enable pattern searching. Roughly
speaking, they present transactions, inputs and outputs as
vertices while treating addresses as edges. The authors report
that they were able to discover high frequency transactions
patterns such as automated laundering operations or denial-
of-service attacks.
Ranshous et al. [43] extend previous work by using a di-
rected hypergraph to model Bitcoin transactions. They model
the transaction as a bipartite hypergraph where edges are in
and out amounts of transactions and the two types of vertices
are transactions and addresses. Based on this hypergraph,
they identify transaction patterns, such as “short thick band”,
a pattern where Bitcoins are received from an exchange, held
for a while and sent back to an exchange. Finally, they used
different features extracted from the hypergraph, such as the
amount of Bitcoin received but also how many times the
address appeared in a certain pattern, to train a classifier
capable of predicting if a particular address belongs to an
exchange.
Di Francesco Maesa et al. [15] analyze Bitcoin user graphs
to detect unusual behavior. The authors find that discrepan-
cies such as outliers in the in-degree distribution of nodes are
often caused by artificial users’ behavior. They then intro-
duce the notion of pseudo-spam transactions, which consist of
transactions with a single input and multiple outputs where
only one has a value higher than a Satoshi, the smallest
amount that can be sent in a transaction. They find that
approximately 0.5% of the total number of multi-input multi-
output transactions followed such a pattern and that these
were often chained.
Several other works also exist about the subject and very
often try to leverage some machine learning techniques either
to cluster or classify Bitcoin addresses. Monamo et al. [35]
attempted to detect anomalies on Bitcoin and show that their
approach is able to partly cluster some fraudulent activity
on the network. Toyoda et al. [52] focus on classifying Ponzi
schemes and related high yield investment programs by apply-
ing supervised learning using features related to transaction
patterns, such as the number of transactions an address is
involved in, or its ratio of pay-in to pay-out.
More recently, a study of EOSIO decentralized applications
(DApps) has been published [27]. The authors analyze the
EOSIO blockchain from another angle: they look at the
DApps activities and attempt to detect bots and fraudulent
activities. The authors identified thousands of bot accounts
IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
as well as real-world attacks, 80 of which have been confirmed
by DApp teams.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic
work to empirically analyze the transactions of Tezos and
XRPL, and the first to compare transactional throughput on
these platforms.
8 CONCLUSIONS
We investigate transaction patterns and value transfers
on the three major high-throughput blockchains: EOSIO,
Tezos, and XRPL. Using direct connections with the respec-
tive blockchains, we fetch transaction data between Octo-
ber 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020. With EOSIO and XRPL, the
majority of the transactions exhibit characteristics resem-
bling DoS attacks: on EOSIO, 95% of the transactions were
triggered by the airdrop of a yet valueless token; on XRPL,
over 94%—consistently in different observation periods—of
the transactions carry no economic value. For Tezos, since
transactions per block are largely outnumbered by mandatory
endorsements, most of the throughput, 76% to be exact, is
occupied for maintaining consensus.
Furthermore, through several case studies, we present
prominent cases of how transactional throughput was used
on different blockchains. Specifically, we show two cases of
spam on EOSIO, on-chain governance related transactions
on Tezos, as well as payments and exchange offers with zero-
value tokens on XRPL.
The bottom line is: the three blockchains studied in
this paper demonstrate the capacity to support high lev-
els of throughput; however, the massive potential of those
blockchains has thus far not been fully realized for their
intended purposes.
