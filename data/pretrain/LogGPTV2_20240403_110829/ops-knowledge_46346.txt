User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Common logs are as follows
 0 04:30:31 Info 00000004 IAdvancedInstallerAwareStore_ResolvePendingTransactions (call 1) (flags = 00000004, progress = NULL, phase = 0, pdwDisposition = @0xb6fd90
 1 00:01:03 Info 00000009@2016/9/28:16:01:03.072 PopulateComponentFamiliesKey - End
 2 00:00:46 Info 00000004 IAdvancedInstallerAwareStore_ResolvePendingTransactions (call 1) (flags = 00000004, progress = NULL, phase = 0, pdwDisposition = @0x116fa70
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Starting the TrustedInstaller main loop. 和 SQM: Initializing online with Windows opt-in: False
B: <*>@<*>/<*>/<*>:<*>:<*>:<*>.<*> PopulateComponentFamiliesKey - End 和 <*> IAdvancedInstallerAwareStore_ResolvePendingTransactions (call <*>) (flags = <*>, progress = <*>, phase = <*>, pdwDisposition = @<*>
C: Loaded Servicing Stack <*> with Core: <*>\cbscore.dll 和 <*>@<*>/<*>/<*>:<*>:<*>:<*>.<*> WcpInitialize (wcp.dll version <*>) called (stack @<*>)
D: Loaded Servicing Stack <*> with Core: <*>\cbscore.dll 和 TrustedInstaller service starts successfully.
