# RHCSA / RHCE Practice Exam #01

## Overview of the Exam
This practice exam is designed based on the publicly available objectives for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) and Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) certifications. The tasks in this exam are intended to simulate the type of challenges you may face during the actual certification exams. It is important to note that this practice exam does not contain any content from actual Red Hat exams.

For an authentic experience, it is recommended to complete this sample exam in a "closed-book" setting, relying only on the system and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation tree provided. However, if you encounter significant difficulties, you may refer to the study guide, online resources, or seek assistance from the instructor. Keep in mind that needing such help might indicate a need for further preparation before taking the official Red Hat exam.

## Your Test Environment
You will be working with a physical server and three virtual machines, which should be configured as follows (where `s` is your station number):

| **System**        | **Physical Host**          | **vm1**                    | **vm2**                    | **vm3**                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Hostname**      | s\host.linux-acc.local     | s\server.linux-acc.local   | s\client.linux-acc.local   | s\untrusted.linux-acc.local    |
| **IP Address**    | 192.168.5.\0               | 192.168.5.\1               | 192.168.5.\2               | DHCP                           |
| **Subnet**        | /22 or 255.255.252.0       | /22 or 255.255.252.0       | /22 or 255.255.252.0       | n/a                            |
| **Default GW**    | 192.168.4.1                | 192.168.4.1                | 192.168.4.1                | 192.168.4.1                    |
| **Nameserver**    | 192.168.7.254              | 192.168.7.254              | 192.168.7.254              | 192.168.7.254                  |

### Network Configuration
- **Local Network**: 192.168.4.0/22 (255.255.252.0), Gateway: 192.168.4.1, DNS: 192.168.7.254
- **Trusted Subnet**: 192.168.5.0/24 (255.255.255.0)
- **Untrusted Subnet**: 192.168.4.0/24 (255.255.255.0)

An installation tree is available at [ftp://192.168.5.200/pub/rhel6](ftp://192.168.5.200/pub/rhel6), which can be used as the basis for a yum repository.

## Common Requirements for Both Exams
- **SELinux**: Ensure SELinux is running in enforcing mode on both the client and server virtual machines after a reboot.
- **IPTables Firewall**: Enable and configure the IPTables firewall to permit the required types of traffic.
- **Untrusted Host**: Use DHCP networking and install/configure only the components necessary for testing prohibited access to the services described below.

## RHCSA Requirements
Complete the following tasks in approximately 2 hours:

1. **Access and Password Reset**:
   - Obtain access to your virtual machines (you do not know the root passwords) and reset the root passwords to "linuxacc".

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the network configuration matches the table above.

3. **User and Group Management**:
   - Create the following users and groups on both the server and client virtual machines:
     - **Users**:
       - tester (UID=1004), password: linuxacc
       - ford (UID=1005), password: linuxacc
       - carter (UID=1006), password: linuxacc
       - reagan (UID=1007), password: linuxacc
       - clinton (UID=1008), password: linuxacc
     - **Groups**:
       - presidents (GID=1000; members: ford, carter, reagan, clinton)
       - republicans (GID=1001; members: ford, reagan)
       - democrats (GID=1002; members: carter, clinton)

4. **Directory Creation and Permissions**:
   - On the server virtual machine, create the following directories with the specified permissions:
     - `/share/presidents`:
       - All four "presidential" users must be able to write here.
       - Directory owned by root and the group presidents.
       - Only users in this group should have access.
       - Files created here should be owned by the group presidents.
       - Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
       - This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that permits sharing by multiple services.
     - `/share/presidents/republicans`:
       - Owned by root and the group republicans.
       - Files created here should be owned by the group republicans.
       - Only users in this group should have access.
       - Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
       - This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that permits sharing by multiple services.
     - `/share/presidents/democrats`:
       - Owned by root and the group democrats.
       - Files created here should be owned by the group democrats.
       - Only users in this group should have access.
       - Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
       - This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that permits sharing by multiple services.

5. **Boot Configuration**:
   - The Client Virtual machine should boot into a GNOME desktop.
   - The Server Virtual machine should boot into runlevel 3 (CLI only) but provide a desktop for root and tester through secure VNC.

6. **Name Resolution**:
   - Configure static name resolution so that the FQDN of each VM resolves correctly (even without DNS) from each of the other VMs.
   - Configure the following aliases for `s\server.linux-acc.local`:
     - `pres.s\server.linux-acc.local`
     - `rep.s\server.linux-acc.local`
     - `dem.s\server.linux-acc.local`

7. **Automounter Configuration**:
   - On the Client virtual machine, create a directory `/home/remote`.
   - Configure the automounter such that attempts to access locations in `/home/remote/presidents/` cause the NFS share `/share/presidents` from the server to be mounted at `/home/remote/presidents`.

8. **Package Installation**:
   - On the Client virtual machine, install the `slang` package.

## RHCE Requirements
Complete the following tasks in approximately 2 hours:

1. **NTP Configuration**:
   - Ensure both the Server and Client Virtual machines obtain their time from NTP.
     - The server should use `pool.ntp.org` and `192.168.5.200`.
     - The client should use the server as its NTP source.

2. **SSH Access**:
   - Allow SSH connections from throughout the 192.168.4.0/22 network.

3. **Service Access Control**:
   - For all other services, allow connections from addresses within the trusted network (192.168.5.0/24) and disallow connections from 192.168.4.0/24.

4. **SMTP Server Configuration**:
   - Configure an SMTP server that allows connections from the trusted subnet.

5. **iSCSI Target Connection**:
   - Connect to the iSCSI target provided by the target portal at 192.168.5.200.

6. **NFS Sharing**:
   - Share `/share/presidents`, `/share/presidents/republicans`, and `/share/presidents/democrats` via NFS to any system in the trusted subnet. Ensure that root privileges cannot be gained from a remote mount.

7. **FTP Server Configuration**:
   - Configure an FTP server to allow anonymous downloads from `/var/ftp/pub` and anonymous uploads to `/var/ftp/pub/inbound` (create this directory and set permissions appropriately). Ensure that uploaded files cannot be viewed or downloaded without admin intervention.

8. **Web Server Configuration**:
   - Configure a Web server to serve the following vhosts:
     - `pres.s\server.linux-acc.local`: serves an index page located in `/share/presidents/`.
     - `rep.s\server.linux-acc.local`: serves an index page located in `/share/presidents/republicans/`.
     - `dem.s\server.linux-acc.local`: serves an index page located in `/share/presidents/democrats/`.
   - Use filesystem ACLs to resolve any permissions issues.
   - Place an index file in each of these locations that indicates which directory it is in and under which name it should be served out.

9. **Samba Configuration**:
   - Share the `/share/presidents` directory using a share name of `presidents`. Make it readable for `ford` and `carter` and writable for `reagan` and `clinton`.

10. **Bash Script and Cron Job**:
    - Create a bash script that uses `top` non-interactively to write two iterations of its report to the file `/root/logs/top_report.txt`.
    - Configure a cron job that performs this task every 20 minutes.

11. **DNS Configuration**:
    - Configure the Server VM to provide a caching DNS server and allow queries from the trusted network.
    - Configure the Client VM to obtain its DNS name resolution from the Server VM.

12. **Kernel Tuning**:
    - Tune the kernel behavior of the Server VM to respond to broadcast pings (ICMP ECHO broadcasts). This must persist after a reboot.
