# RHCSA / RHCE Practice Exam #01 {#rhcsa-rhce-practice-exam-01 .title}
::: {#this-exam .section}
# This Exam:
These tasks are taken from the objectives Red Hat has publicly posted
and should therefore approximate the type of tasks one might find on the
RHCSA and RHCE exams. It is expressly NOT based on actual contents of
actual Red Hat Exams.
For the most authentic experience, this sample exam should be undertaken
in a \"closed-book\" manner -- referring to nothing but what is on the
system or contained on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation tree
that will be made available to you. However, because this Sample Exam is
intended in part as a learning experience in itself, should you get
seriously stuck you may refer to the Study Guide, to online resources,
or to assistance from the instructor. Recognize, though, that such a
decision may indicate a need for additional preparation before
undertaking the Red Hat Exam.

You should configure your physical server and three virtual machines as
follows (where \ is your station number):

# Requirements Common to Both Exams
-   SELinux must, at the end of the exam, be running in enforcing mode
    on both the client and server virtual machines after a reboot of
    each.
-   The IPTables firewall must be enabled and configured to permit the
    types of traffic set forth in these requirements.
-   On the untrusted host, use DHCP networking and install/configure
    only that components that are required for testing prohibited access
    to the services described below.

# RHCSA Requirements
Complete the following in approximately 2 hours:
-   Obtain access to your virtual machines (you do not know the root
    passwords) and reset the root passwords to \"linuxacc\".
-   Ensure that the network configuration matches that in the table
    above.
-   Create users and groups on both your server and client virtual
    machines:
    > Users:
    >
    > > -   tester (UID=1004), password: linuxacc
    > > -   ford (UID=1005), password: linuxacc
    > > -   carter (UID=1006), password: linuxacc
    > > -   reagan (UID=1007), password: linuxacc
    > > -   clinton (UID=1008), password: linuxacc
    >
    > Groups:
    >
    > > -   presidents (GID=1000; members=ford, carter, reagan, clinton)
    > > -   republicans (GID=1001; members=ford, reagan)
    > > -   democrats (GID=1002; members=carter, clinton)
-   On the server virtual machine, create the following directories:
    > /share/presidents
    >
    > > -   All four (\"presidential\") users must be able to write
    > >     here.
    > > -   This directory must be owned by root and the group
    > >     presidents.
    > > -   Only users in this group should have any access to the
    > >     directory.
    > > -   Files created here should be owned by the group presidents.
    > > -   Users should not be able to delete files they did not
    > >     create.
    > > -   This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will
    > >     permit it to be shared by multiple services.
    >
    > /share/presidents/republicans
    >
    > > -   This directory should be owned by root and the group
    > >     republicans.
    > > -   Files created here should be owned by the group republicans.
    > > -   Only users in this group should have any access to the
    > >     directory.
    > > -   Users should not be able to delete files they did not
    > >     create.
    > > -   This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will
    > >     permit it to be shared by multiple services.
    >
    > /share/presidents/democrats
    >
    > > -   This directory should be owned by root and the group
    > >     democrats.
    > > -   Files created here should be owned by the group democrats.
    > > -   Only users in this group should have any access to the
    > >     directory.
    > > -   Users should not be able to delete files they did not
    > >     create.
    > > -   This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will
    > >     permit it to be shared by multiple services.
-   The Client Virtual machine should boot into a GNOME desktop
-   The Server Virtual machine should boot into runlevel 3 (CLI only),
    but should provide a desktop for root and for tester through secure
    VNC.
-   Configure static name resolution such that FQDN of each VM resolves
    correctly (even without DNS) from each of the other VMs.
-   Configure each of the following names as aliases for
    [s\server.linux-acc.local]{.pre}:
    > -   [pres.s\server.linux-acc.local]{.pre}
    > -   [rep.s\server.linux-acc.local]{.pre}
    > -   [dem.s\server.linux-acc.local]{.pre}
-   On the Client virtual machine, create a directory /home/remote.
-   On the Client virtual machine, configure the automounter such that
    attempts to access locations in /home/remote/presidents/ cause the
    nfs share /share/presidents from your server to be mounted at
    /home/remote/presidents.
-   On the Client virtual machine, install the slang package.

# RHCE Requirements
Complete the following in approximately 2 hours:
-   Ensure that both the Server and Client Virtual machines are
    obtaining their time from NTP. Your server virtual machine should
    obtain its time from pool.ntp.org and from 192.168.5.200. Your
    client virtual machine should get its time from your server virtual
    machine.
-   SSH connections should be allowed from throughout the 192.168.4.0/22
    network.
-   For all other services, connections should be allowed from addresses
    within the trusted network (192.168.5.0/24), but disallowed from
    192.168.4.0/24.
-   Configure an SMTP server that allows connections from the trusted
    subnet.
-   Connect to the iSCSI target provided by the target portal at
    192.168.5.200.
-   Configure /share/presidents, /share/presidents/republicans, and
    /share/presidents/democrats to be shared via NFS to any system in
    the trusted subnet. Ensure that root privileges cannot be gained
    from a remote mount.
-   Configure an FTP server to allow anonymous downloads from
    /var/ftp/pub and anonymous uploads to /var/ftp/pub/inbound (create
    this directory and set permissions appropriately). Ensure that
    uploaded files cannot be viewed or downloaded without admin
    intervention.
-   Configure a Web server to serve the following vhosts:
    > Access to [pres.s\server.linux-acc.local]{.pre}
    >
    > :   serves an index page located in /share/presidents/
    >
    > Access to [rep.s\server.linux-acc.local]{.pre}
    >
    > :   serves an index page located in /share/presidents/republicans/
    >
    > Access to [dem.s\server.linux-acc.local]{.pre}
    >
    > :   serves an index page located in /share/presidents/democrats/
    >
    > Use filesystem ACLs to resolve any permissions issues you
    > encounter.
    >
    > Place an index file in each of these locations that indicates
    > which directory it is in and under which name it should be served
    > out.
-   Configure Samba to share the /share/presidents directory using a
    share name of presidents. Make it readable for ford and carter and
    writable for reagan and clinton.
-   Create a bash script that uses top non-interactively to write 2
    interations of its report to the file /root/logs/top_report.txt.
    Configure a cron job that performs this task every 20 minutes.
-   Configure your Server VM to provide a caching DNS server and to
    allow queries from the trusted network. Configure your Client VM to
    obtain its DNS name resolution from your Server VM.
-   Tune the kernel behavior of your Server VM so that it will respond
    to broadcast pings (ICMP ECHO broadcasts). This must persist after a
    reboot.
