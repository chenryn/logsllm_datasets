User: I just downloaded and installed Python 2.7.2 to my laptop and I am trying to run some sample programs. My laptop is running Windows XP.
When I open a cmd window and type python I get:

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

I am not a Windows person (mostly mainframes). However I am guessing that there is some command that I need to execute to define python as a command. Can anyone tell me what that command is?
The installer placed Python at C:\Python27\.
Assistant: emphasis: Remember to always RESTART the CMD WINDOW after setting the PATH environmental variable for it to take effect!
