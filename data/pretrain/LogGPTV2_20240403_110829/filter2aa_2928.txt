## .NET Framework Security
### Security Enhancements
- The .NET Framework has undergone several security improvements to mitigate common vulnerabilities.

### .NET Architecture
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation):** 
  - WPF is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications.
  - **Browser-Hosted Applications:**
    - **Default Enable DEP (Data Execution Prevention):** This feature helps prevent code execution from non-executable memory regions.
    - **Security Zone Behavior:**
      - **Local Computer:** Automatic full trust, no action needed.
      - **Intranet and Trusted Sites:** Prompt for full trust. Sign the XBAP with a certificate so that the user sees the source in the prompt.
      - **Internet:** Fails with "Trust Not Granted." Sign the XBAP with a certificate to bypass this issue.

### Debugging WPF
- **To configure Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 to debug an XBAP that calls a Web service:**
  1. Select the project in Solution Explorer.
  2. Click on the Project menu and select Properties.
  3. In the Project Designer, click the Debug tab.
  4. In the Start Action section, select "Start external program" and enter:
     - `C:\WINDOWS\System32\PresentationHost.exe`
  5. In the Start Options section, enter the following into the Command line arguments text box:
     - `-debug filename` (e.g., `-debug c:\example.xbap`)

## ClickOnce Deployment
- **Comparison with Windows Installer:**
  - **ClickOnce:**
    - Install Files
    - Create Shortcuts
    - Associate File Extensions
    - Install to GAC (Global Assembly Cache)
    - Self-Repair
  - **Windows Installer:**
    - Install Files
    - Create Shortcuts
    - Associate File Extensions
    - Install Services
    - Manage ODBC
    - Manage COM+
    - Write to Registry
    - Advertising
    - File/Folder/Registry Permissions

### ClickOnce Trust Levels
- **Internet or Full Trust:**
  - **Permissions not available in the Internet zone:**
    - **FileIOPermission:** Controls the ability to read and write files on disk. Applications in the Internet zone cannot read files on the user's hard disk.
    - **RegistryPermission:** Controls the ability to read/write to the registry. Applications in the Internet zone cannot access or control state in the user's registry.
    - **SecurityPermission.UnmanagedCode:** Controls the ability to call native Win32 functions.

## .XBAP/.Application
- **Warning:**
  - Start the exploitation process with caution.

### Exploit Examples
- **ClickOnce (Internet):**
  - Code snippet:
    ```assembly
    00000025  mov         eax,dword ptr ds:[037B20C4h]  
    0000002b  mov         dword ptr [ebp-40h],eax  
    0000002e  mov         ecx,dword ptr [ebp-3Ch] //ecx=0x41414141 
    00000031  mov         eax,dword ptr [ecx]  
    00000033  mov         eax,dword ptr [eax+28h]  
    00000036  call        dword ptr [eax]  
    ```

- **Exploit with MS12-035:**
  - **Heap Spraying:**
  - **Finding No ASLR Module:**
  - **ROP (Return-Oriented Programming):**
  - **Running Shellcode:**
  - **Using COM Technical Bypass HIPS (Blackhat 2011):**

### Local Compress File Attack
- **Internet Attack:**
  - Must add the site to the trusted sites list to avoid warnings.
- **Attack (ClickOnce INTERNET):**
  - Limited by the Windows Presentation Foundation Security Sandbox.
  - Uses .XBAP, .Application, and HTML.

### Why Antivirus Cannot Detect?
- **Focus on Internet Explorer Process:**
  - Heap spraying detection only works in the browser process.
  - Script decoding does not work in the WPF process.
  - Static detection of XBAP files is challenging.

### Patched Affect
- **MS11-044 (INTERNET check):**
- **MS12-035 (INTERNET and LOCAL check):**

### Remote Attack on MS11-044
- **Web Attack Demo:**

### Bypassing Patched MS11-044
- **LocalComputer:**
- **RAR:**

### Attack (ClickOnce FULL TRUST)
- **.NET can control everything:**
  - Uses .XBAP, .Application, and HTML.
  - Example: `Process.Start("calc.exe");`
- **WEB Attack:**
  - Must add the site to the trusted sites list and display a warning.

### MS12-035
- **Local Warning:**

### Summary
- **.NET Remote Attack:**
- **.NET Local Attack:**
- **Patched Affect:**
- **Trend: Always Finding New Attack Trends:**

### Conclusion
- Thank you for your attention.

### Do You Have .NET Framework Installed?
- If not, consider installing it to stay up-to-date with the latest security features and improvements.
