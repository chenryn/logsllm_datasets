### tcmsetup: TAPI Client Configuration Command

The `tcmsetup` command is used to configure or disable the TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface) client. For TAPI to function correctly, this command must be executed to specify the remote servers that will be utilized by TAPI clients.

#### Important Notes
- To execute this command, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority.
- If the computer is part of a domain, members of the Domain Admins group may also be able to perform this procedure.
- As a security best practice, consider using the "Run as" feature to perform this operation.

#### Syntax
```sh
tcmsetup [/q] [/x] /c <server1> [server2 ...]
tcmsetup [/q] /c /d
```

#### Parameters
- **/q**  
  Suppresses the display of message boxes during the setup process.
- **/x**  
  Specifies that connection-oriented callbacks should be used for networks with high packet loss. If this parameter is omitted, connectionless callbacks will be used.
- **/c**  
  Required. Indicates that the command is for client setup.
- **<server1> [server2 ...]**  
  Required. Specifies the name(s) of the remote server(s) that provide the TAPI service providers. The client will use the lines and phones provided by these service providers. The client must be in the same domain as the server or in a domain that has a two-way trust relationship with the domain containing the server. Additional servers can be specified by separating their names with spaces.
- **/d**  
  Clears the list of remote servers and disables the TAPI client, preventing it from using the TAPI service providers on the remote servers.
- **/?**  
  Displays help information at the command prompt.

#### Remarks
- Before a client user can use a phone or line on a TAPI server, the telephony server administrator must assign the user to the specific phone or line.
- The list of telephony servers created by this command replaces any existing list. You cannot use this command to add to the existing list; it will overwrite the current configuration.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively set up or disable the TAPI client and ensure proper functionality in your network environment.
