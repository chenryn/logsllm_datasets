User: I have the applescript which will displays menu list and allow user to select menu items etc. 
It runs fine by itself. And now I try to run it in python. I get the No user interaction allowed. (-1713) error. 
I looked online. I tried the following: 

add on run function in the same applescript,  so what i did is just add the main into the run
on run 
 tell application “AppleScript Runner”
  main()
 end tell
end run
i tried to run the above in python 
import os
def main():
  os.system ('osascript -e "tell application "ApplesScript Runner" do script /Users/eee/applescript/iTune.scpt end tell"')
if name == 'main':
   main() 
Neither way works. Can anyone tell me how to do this correctly?
Assistant: My issue was an app with LSBackgroundOnly = YES set attempting to run an AppleScript that displays UI, such as display dialog ...

Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=2 "No such file or directory"
AppleScript.scpt: execution error: No user interaction allowed. (-1713)

Using tell application "Finder" ... or etc. works, as shown in the other answer.
Or, remove the LSBackgroundOnly key to enable UI AppleScripts without telling a different Application.
LSUIElement presents a similar mode - no dock icon, no menu bar, etc. - but DOES allow UI AppleScripts to be launched.
