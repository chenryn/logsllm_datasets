User: How to solve the problem that Kubernetes nodes cannot join the cluster?
Assistant: First, you need to confirm that the network connection between the nodes and the cluster is normal, and you can use the Ping command to check the connection. If you find that you cannot connect, it may be due to a firewall or network policy issue. Second, check whether the Kubernetes service of the node is normal. You can use the systemctl command to check whether the kubelet, kube-proxy, and docker services are started. If not, you need to start them manually. In addition, it is also necessary to check whether the kubeconfig file of the node is configured correctly. You can use the kubectl command to view the kubeconfig file. If the content of the file is incorrect, it may be due to the file being modified or insufficient permissions. Finally, if all the above steps fail to resolve the issue, you can try redeploying the node. The issue can be resolved by cleaning up all related services and files on the node, and reinstalling the Kubernetes components.
