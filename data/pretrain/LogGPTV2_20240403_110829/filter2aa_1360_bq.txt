4chan is a mess. It is an image-board website and users generally post anonymously, with the most recent posts 
appearing above the rest. 4chan is split into various boards with their own specific content and guidelines, 
modeled from Japanese image-boards. The site has been linked to internet subcultures and activism groups, 
most notably Anonymous. The site's "Random" board, also known as ”/b/", was the first board to be created, 
and is the one that receives the most traffic. This site is full of bullying, pornography, threats, and general illicit 
behavior. It has also been the focus of numerous investigations. There is no search feature. In this scenario, we
I am consistently amazed at the results from this Subreddit. What Is This Thing is a place where you can post a 
digital photo of practically anything, and someone will know exactly what it is while providing detailed and cited 
additional information. Many users post images of old antiques and intricate items hoping to identify something 
valuable in their collection. I use it to identify tattoo meanings, graffiti, suspicious items mailed to politicians, 
vehicle parts, and just about anything else that is presented to me during my investigations.
Real World Application: In 2012,1 was asked to assist with a death investigation of a "Jane Doe". I submitted 
a sanitized version of a tattoo on her back that appeared to be Chinese symbols. Within five minutes, a Reddit 
user identified the symbols, their meaning, and references to the region of China that would probably be related 
to my investigation. A reverse image search of his examples led to information about a human trafficking ring 
with which the victim was associated. This all occurred over a period of one hour.

The search field within TikTok pages can be unreliable. Instead, we can formulate a URL with search terms. 
The following presents posts which include "osint" within the original post.
TikTok is a Chinese video-sharing social networking service which has become viral globally. It is used to create 
short music, lip-sync, dance, comedy, and talent videos of 3 to 15 seconds, and short looping videos of 3 to 60 
seconds. Posts accept and display comments, both of which require login for access. There is a limited native 
search within the website, but we can formulate URLs to gain direct access to targeted details. The following 
URL structure displays the user profile for "inteltechniques".
Google indexes individual TikTok posts, so the following search query would present results which include the 
term "osint" within any post or author profile. This can be beneficial to discover deleted posts.

Once you find your target, navigating through the posts is similar to the techniques previously mentioned with 
Instagram. However, we do have a few unique offerings. Each profile possesses three identifiers within the 
source code view of the page. In the following example, I searched the following text within the source code 
view of the TikTok page of @willsmith, with the result in parentheses.
This will usually include a video which can be played in full screen by clicking on it. Once in the player view, 
you can right-click the video and save it natively as an MP4 file. Most videos display an upload date within the 
content, but I always prefer to obtain a full date and time of upload. To do this, right-click a post and choose to 
view the page source. When this new tab of text opens, search (ctrl-f or emd-f) for tplv". This should present 
a result similar to the following.
The numbers directly before this search term represent a Unix time stamp, which was explained in previous 
can convert this number at unixtimestamp.com, which produces the following result
We now know the exact date and time of the post. Everything presented about TikTok up to this point should 
not require an account However, accessing comments within a post requires you to be logged in. I always 
recommend a "burner" account which is associated with a Gmail address or social network connection. When 
you attempt to create an account, you will see a list of accepted associations. Once you are logged in, you should 
see any comments included with the target post. Each post presents a username with hyperlink; the comment 
from that user; the date of the comment; the number of "likes"; and an option to expand further comments to 
that comment. Screen captures may work well for unpopular posts, but posts with many views may be a problem. 
Export Comments (exportcomments.com) will extract the first 100 comments from any post. A premium 
account is required to download larger content. There are several "scraper" applications and Chrome extensions 
which claim to aid in comment exportation, but 1 have found them all to be unreliable.
There are numerous TikTok services which provide analytics on target profiles. I prefer those which allow 
submission within the URL, such as the following, which display results for "vancityreynolds" (Ryan Reynolds, 
who is an owner of Mint Mobile, which may be of interest to listeners of my show).
Note that nicknames are not unique. They are vanity names which can be reused. Wc can now search the user 
number within search engines in order to identify additional posts which may no longer be present within the 
TikTok website. Once you identify an individual post, it may appear as follows.

Meetup consists of users and groups, with all communication related to events where people actually meet in 
real life. Each user creates a profile that includes the person's interests, photos, and username. A group is created 
by one or more users and is focused on a general interest in a specific location. An example would be the 
"Houston Dog Park Lovers", which is a Houston-based group of dog owners that meet at dog parks. Each 
group will post events that the members can attend. The majority of the events posted on Meetup are visible to 
the public and can be attended by anyone. Some groups choose to mark the details of the event as private and 
you must be a member to see the location. Membership is free and personal information is not required.
While most of these details will not be helpful to an investigation, they should all be documented. I have included 
most of the TikTok search features within the Communities Search Tool presented in a moment We currendy 
see TikTok as part of every investigation which is associated with a target under the age of 20. It is important to 
understand this platform and the many ways of exploring the content

Event Search (Protest): site:meetup.com inurkevents Protest 
Post Search (Protest): site:meetup.com inurkdiscussions Protest 
Google Keyword Search (OSINT): site:meetup.com OSINT
You can search Meetup by interest or location on practically any page. Once you locate a group page, you can 
browse the members of the group. This group page will also identify any future and past events sponsored by 
the group. These past events will identify the users that attended the event as well as feedback about the event. 
This site no longer offers the option to search by username. In order to do this, you will need to use a search 
engine as described in a moment. A user profile will often include links to social networks and messages from 
associates on the website. Additionally, these profiles will identify any future Meetup events that the user plans 
on attending. Because of this, the site has been used in the past by civil process servers, detectives, and the news 
media to locate people that had been avoiding them. The following Google search structures have been most 
helpful in my experience.
While logged in to a Nextdoor account, navigate to "Settings" then "Neighborhoods". By default, you can only 
sec activity within your specific neighborhood. However, clicking the "Explore Neighborhoods" button should 
present surrounding areas which you can join. In my experience, you can usually see the majority of your county 
by joining all available groups.
This popular online community allows for people within a specific neighborhood or geographical area tc 
communicate privately within a controlled space. People within a neighborhood in Texas cannot see posts from 
a neighborhood in Illinois. In order to join a specific neighborhood, one must either receive an invite from 
another neighbor or request a physical invite be sent via postal mail to an address within range. This presents 
problems for OSINT. If you are investigating posts within your county, there are a few things you can do to 
extend your range.

You must have an account to browse profiles, which is usually free.
• 
You must have a premium (paid) account to contact anyone.

If a target uses one dating service, he or she likely uses others.
When investigating cheating spouses, background information, personal character, or applicant details, dating 
sites can lead to interesting evidence. The presence of a dating profile does not mean anything by itself. Millions 
of people successfully use these services to find mates. When a target's profile is located, it will usually lead to 
personal information that cannot be found anywhere else. \Xzhile many people may restrict personal details on 
social networks such as Facebook, they tend to let down their guard on these intimate dating websites. In my 
experience, the following will apply to practically evety dating website.
Username: Evety dating website requires a username to be associated with the profile, and this data is 
searchable. Surprisingly, most users choose a username that has been used somewhere else. I have seen many 
dating profiles that hide a person's real name and location, but possess the same username as a Twitter account. 
The Twitter account then identifies name, location, and friends. Additional username tools are presented later.
Instead of explaining each of the dating services, I will focus on methodology of searching all of them. While 
each website is unique and possesses a specific way of searching, they are all very similar. Overall, there are three 
standard search techniques that I have found useful, and they are each identified below.
Text Search: This is a technique that is often overlooked. Most dating network profiles include an area where 
the users can describe themselves in their own words. This freeform area often includes misspellings and obvious 
grammatical errors. These can be searched to identify additional dating networks since many users simply copy 
and paste their biography from one site to another. In 2013,1 was teaching an OSINT course in Canada. During 
a break, one of the attendees asked for assistance with a sexual assault case that involved the dating website 
Plenty Of Fish. The unknown suspect would meet women through the online service and assault them. All of 
the information on his profile was fake, and the photos were of poor quality and unhelpful. Together, we copied 
and pasted each sentence that he had written in his bio for the profile. Eventually, we found one that was very 
unique and grammatically worded poorly. A quoted Google search of this sentence provided only one result It 
was die real profile of the suspect on Match.com, under his real name, that contained the same sentence 
describing himself. The high-quality photos on this legitimate page were used to verify that he was the suspect.
Photo Search: In later chapters, I explain how to conduct reverse-image searching across multiple websites. 
This technique can compare an image you find on a dating network with images across all social networks, 
identifying any matches. This will often convert an "anonymous" dating profile into a fully-identifiable social 
network page. This applies to any dating networks, and photos will be your most reliable way of identifying your 
target.
