User: We used Docker as the application deployment tool and deployed multiple containers on the same host. Please provide a scheme to ensure resource isolation between containers and high availability of the application.
Assistant: In order to ensure resource isolation between containers and high availability of applications, the following solutions are recommended: 1. Use container orchestration tools such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to manage and schedule multiple containers in a unified manner, and implement container scheduling by setting resource limits and allocation policies. Resource isolation between. 2. For containers that need to access shared data, these data should be stored in external storage devices, such as distributed file systems such as NFS or Ceph, to avoid resource waste and data inconsistency caused by copying data between containers. 3. To achieve high availability for applications, consider adopting service orchestration technologies, such as automatic container restart and health check mechanisms, to ensure that faulty containers can be automatically restarted or replaced. 4. You can set the host where the container is located to be highly available or load balanced, such as using load balancing software such as Linux cluster or Haproxy, so that requests can be distributed among the hosts, reducing the risk of single point of failure. 5. Container logs and monitoring information need to be managed centrally. For example, monitoring tools such as Rizhiyi, Prometheus, and Grafana are used to quickly locate problems and troubleshoot them.
