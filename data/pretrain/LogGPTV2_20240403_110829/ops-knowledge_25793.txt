User: Background
I find pylint useful, but I also find it is horrifically undocumented, has painfully verbose output, and lacks an intuitive interface.
I'd like to use pylint, but it keeps pumping out an absurd number of pointless 'convention' messages, e.g. C: 2: Line too long (137/80) etc.
Question
If I could disable these, pylint would be much more usable for me. How does one disable these 'convention' messages?
My own efforts
I've tried putting disable-msg=C301 in ~/.pylintrc (which is being loaded because when I put an error in there pylint complains) which I understand to be the "Line too Long" message based on running this command in the pylint package directory (documentation that can be found would be nice):
$ grep "Line too long" **/*.py
   checkers/format.py:    'C0301': ('Line too long (%s/%s)',
Yet this disable-msg does nothing. I'd disable the entire convention category with the disable-msg-cat= command, but there's no indication anywhere I can find of what an identifier of the convention category would be for this command â€” the intuitive disable-message-cat=convention has no effect.
I'd be much obliged for some direction on this issue.
Thank you.

Assistant: If I'm not mistaken, you should be able to use --disable-msg-cat=C (can't remember whether it's uppercase or lowercase or both) to accomplish this.
UPDATE: In later versions of pylint, you should use --disable=C
