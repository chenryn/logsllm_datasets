User: I know that I should open a binary file using "rb" instead of "r" because Windows behaves differently for binary and non-binary files. 
But I don't understand what exactly happens if I open a file the wrong way and why this distinction is even necessary. Other operating systems seem to do fine by treating both kinds of files the same.
Assistant: In Windows, text mode will convert the newline \n to a carriage return followed by a newline \r\n.
If you read text in binary mode, there are no problems.  If you read binary data in text mode, it will likely be corrupted.
