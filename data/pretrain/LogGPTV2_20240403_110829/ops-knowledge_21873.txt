Question: "A security analyst is reviewing an application that parses XML input and constructs an XML database. The XML documents are validated against a DTD before processing. The DTD specifies that the <userid> node should occur exactly once within a <user> node. The analyst wants to inject an administrative user by ensuring that the injected <userid> node is processed by the parser, and all following nodes are ignored. Which of the following inputs, when inserted into the email field, would correctly comment out the rest of the user data, assuming the analyst has control over the preceding node values?"
 "A": "admin@example.com</mail><userid>0</userid><mail>admin@example.com<!--"
 "B": "admin@example.com<!--</mail><userid>0</userid><mail>admin@example.com"
 "C": "admin@example.com</mail><userid>0</userid><!--<mail>admin@example.com"
 "D": "admin@example.com</mail><userid>0</userid><mail>admin@example.com-->"
Answer: B
