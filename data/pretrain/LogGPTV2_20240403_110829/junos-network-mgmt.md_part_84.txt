You can view all of the port mirror analyzers configured on the switch, including any that are disabled, by
using the show ethernet-switching-options command in configuration mode.
user@switch# show ethernet-switching-options
inactive: analyzer employee-web-monitor {
loss-priority high;
output {
analyzer employee-monitor {
loss-priority high;
input {
ingress {
interface ge-0/0/0.0;
interface ge-0/0/1.0;
}
}
output {
vlan {
remote-analyzer;
}
1047
}
}
Meaning
This output shows that the employee-monitor analyzer has a ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, the
default), a loss priority of high (set this option to high whenever the analyzer output is to a VLAN), is
mirroring the traffic entering ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1, and is sending the mirrored traffic to the analyzer
called remote-analyzer.

Overview and Topology | 1048
Mirroring All Employee Traffic for Local Analysis | 1049
Verification | 1052
Juniper Networks devices allow you to configure port mirroring to send copies of packets to either a
local interface for local monitoring, to a VLAN or to a bridge domain for remote monitoring. You can use
mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering or exiting a VLAN or bridge domain
You can then analyze the mirrored traffic locally or remotely using a protocol analyzer. You can install an
analyzer on a local destination interface. If you are sending mirrored traffic to an analyzer VLAN or
bridge domain, you can use an analyzer on a remote monitoring station.
This topic describes how to configure local mirroring on a switching device. The examples in this topic
describe how to configure a switching device to mirror traffic entering interfaces connected to employee
computers to an analyzer output interface on that same device.
Requirements
Use either one of the following hardware and software components:
1048
• One EX9200 switch with Junos OS Release 13.2 or later
• One MX Series router with Junos OS Release 14.1 or later
Before you configure port mirroring, be sure you have an understanding of mirroring concepts. For
information about analyzers, see "Understanding Port Mirroring Analyzers" on page 1018. For
information about port mirroring, see "Understanding Layer 2 Port Mirroring" on page 1012.
Overview and Topology
This topic describes how to mirror all traffic entering ports on the switching device to a destination
interface on the same device (local mirroring). In this case, the traffic is entering ports connected to
employee computers.
NOTE: Mirroring all traffic requires significant bandwidth and should only be done during an
active investigation.
The interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 serve as connections for employee computers.
The interface ge-0/0/10 is reserved for analysis of the mirrored traffic.
Connect a PC running a protocol analyzer to the analyzer output interface.
NOTE: Multiple ports mirrored to one interface can cause buffer overflow, resulting in mirrored
packets being dropped at the output interface.
Figure 34 on page 1049 shows the network topology for this example.

set forwarding-options analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
set forwarding-options analyzer employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure an analyzer called employee-monitor and specify both the input (source) interfaces and the
analyzer output interface:
1. Configure each interface to be used in the analyzer configuration. Use the family protocol that is
correct for your platform.
EX Series
[edit]
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching
set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching
To configure family bridge on an interface, you must configure interface-mode access or interface-mode
trunk as well. You also must configure vlan-id.
MX Series
[edit]
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family bridge interface-mode access vlan-id 99
set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family bridge interface-mode access vlan-id 98
1051
2. Configure each interface connected to employee computers as an output analyzer interface employee-
monitor.
[edit forwarding-options]
set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/0.0
set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
3. Configure the output analyzer interface for the employee-monitor analyzer.
This will be the destination interface for the mirrored packets.
[edit forwarding-options]
set analyzer employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
Results
Check the results of the configuration.
[edit]
user@device# show forwarding-options

Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer employee-monitor has been created on the switching device with the appropriate
input interfaces and the appropriate output interface.
Action
Use the show forwarding-options analyzer operational command to verify that an analyzer is configured as
expected.
user@device> show forwarding-options analyzer
Analyzer name : employee-monitor
Mirror rate : 1
Maximum packet length : 0
State : up
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Output interface : ge-0/0/10.0
Meaning
The output shows that the employee-monitor analyzer has a ratio of 1 (that is, mirroring every packet, the
default setting), the maximum size of the original packet mirrored is 0 (indicating that the entire packet is
mirrored), the state of the configuration is up, and the analyzer is mirroring the traffic entering the
ge-0/0/0 interface, and sending the mirrored traffic to the ge-0/0/10 interface.
If the state of the output interface is down or if the output interface is not configured, the value of State
will be down indicating that the analyzer will not be receiving mirrored traffic.

Mirroring Employee Traffic for Remote Analysis By Using a Statistical Analyzer | 1055
Verification | 1066
Juniper Networks devices allow you to configure port mirroring to send copies of packets to either a
local interface for local monitoring or to a VLAN or bridge domain for remote monitoring. You can use
mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering or exiting a VLAN
• Packets entering or exiting a bridge domain
If you are sending mirrored traffic to an analyzer VLAN or bridge domain, you can analyze the mirrored
traffic by using a protocol analyzer running on a remote monitoring station.
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you do the following:
• Disable your configured mirroring sessions when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by:
• Using statistical sampling.
• Setting ratios to select statistical samples.
• Using firewall filters.
The examples in this topic describe how to configure remote port mirroring to analyze employee
resource usage.
1054
Requirements
This example uses one of the following pairs of hardware and software components:
• One EX9200 switch connected to another EX9200 switch, both running Junos OS Release 13.2 or
later
• One MX Series router connected to another MX Series router, both running Junos OS Release 14.1
or later
Before you configure remote mirroring, be sure that:
• You have an understanding of mirroring concepts. For information about analyzers, see
"Understanding Port Mirroring Analyzers" on page 1018. For information about port mirroring, see
"Understanding Layer 2 Port Mirroring" on page 1012.
• The interfaces that the analyzer will use as input interfaces have already been configured on the
switching device.
Overview and Topology

Topology | 1055
This topic describes how to configure port mirroring to a remote analyzer VLAN or bridge domain so
that the analysis can be done from a remote monitoring station.
Figure 35 on page 1055 shows the network topology for both the EX Series example and the MX Series
example scenarios.

Topology
Figure 35: Network Topology for Remote Port Mirroring and Analysis
In this example:
• Interface ge-0/0/0 is a Layer 2 interface, and interface ge-0/0/1 is a Layer 3 interface (both are
interfaces on the source device) that serve as connections for employee computers.
• Interface ge-0/0/10 is a Layer 2 interface that connects the source switching device to the
destination switching device.
• Interface ge-0/0/5 is a Layer 2 interface that connects the destination switching device to the
remote monitoring station.
• The analyzer remote-analyzer is configured on all switching devices in the topology to carry the
mirrored traffic. This topology can use either a VLAN or a bridge domain.
