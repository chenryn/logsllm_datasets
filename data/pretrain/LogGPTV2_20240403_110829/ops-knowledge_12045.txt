User: Is it possible to use mv in Windows python. 
I want to use mv --backup=t *.pdf ..\ to make copies of existing file but don't want to overwrite them, and Windows move command does not supports suffixes with existing files.
I can run my script with mv command in Windows Bash or CygWin but not on cmd or powershell. 
So is it possible to use Linux commands in Windows python?
EDIT: i'm using python 2.7
Assistant: well I tried a different approach to rename the existing files with a random hex at the end on the 'name'
and i'm pretty much satisfied with it :D
if os.path.isfile('../%s.pdf' % name) == True:
    os.system('magick *.jpg pdf:"%s".pdf' % name_hex)
else: 
    os.system('magick *.jpg pdf:"%s".pdf' % name)
