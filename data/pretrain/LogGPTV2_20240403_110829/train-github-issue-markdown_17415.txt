Opening a new issue since no action has been taken on #842 for more than a
month.
Looks like we have an issue on how fastapi handles lists of elements passed as
`Form` parameter (so anything that is type hinted `List[...] = Form(...)`).
The issue doesn't arise when they are defined as `Query` parameters.  
After some digging I managed to get to the root of the problem, which is _how_
we pass the parameters when making an api call. fastapi indeed correctly
understands that the input needs to be a list of elements, but doesn't parse
the list if it comes from a single field.
Example using `Query`, works as expected
    @app.post("/")
    def api_test(l: List[int] = Query(...)) -> List[int]:
        return l
Api request generated using the swagger UI
    curl -X 'GET' \
      'http://localhost:5009/?l=1&l=2' \
      -H 'accept: application/json'
note how the passed values are `l=1&l=2`
    [
      1,
      2
    ]
Example using `Form`, doesn't work as expected
    @app.post("/")
    def api_test(l: List[int] = Form(...)) -> List[int]:
        return l
Api request generated using the swagger UI
    curl -X 'POST' \
      'http://localhost:5009/' \
      -H 'accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
      -d 'l=1,2'
note how the passed values are `l=1,2`
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": [
            "body",
            "l",
            0
          ],
          "msg": "value is not a valid integer",
          "type": "type_error.integer"
        }
      ]
    }
Manual api request
    curl -X 'POST' \
      'http://localhost:5009/' \
      -H 'accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
      -d 'l=1' \
      -d 'l=2'
Now the values are passed as `-d 'l=1'` and `-d 'l=2'`
    [
      1,
      2
    ]
I am fairly sure that `l=1,2` should be an accepted way of passing a list of
values as parameter, but fastapi doesn't seem to like it. Also, if this isn't
the case, the Swagger UI doesn't produce the correct curl requests for lists
given as `Form` parameters.
Packages:
  * `fastapi`: `0.66.0`
  * `python`: `3.7.4`
Let me know if you need other details!
