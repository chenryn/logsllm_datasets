User: How to use Python to write scripts to automatically execute operating system commands in batches?
Assistant: Using Python to write scripts to automatically execute operating system commands in batches requires the following steps: 1. Import the operating system command module In Python, you can use the os module to execute operating system commands. Therefore, you need to import the os module at the beginning of the script, for example: ``` import os ``` 2. Write a command execution function Next, you need to write a function to execute the operating system command, for example: ``` def execute_command(command): os. system(command) ``` This function accepts a parameter command of string type, which is the operating system command to be executed. The function body uses the os.system() function to execute the command. 3. Write a batch execution function Next, you need to write a batch execution function that accepts a command list as a parameter and executes each command in turn. For example: ``` def execute_commands(commands): for command in commands: execute_command(command) ``` This function first uses the for loop to traverse the command list, and calls the execute_command() function for each command to execute. 4. Call the batch execution function Finally, call the execute_commands() function in the script and pass in the command list as a parameter. For example: ``` commands = ['ls -l', 'echo "Hello World!"', 'mkdir test'] execute_commands(commands) ``` This code segment defines a list of commands, which contains three operating systems Order. Then pass the command list into the execute_commands() function to execute. The complete sample code is as follows: ``` import os def execute_command(command): os.system(command) def execute_commands(commands): for command in commands: execute_command(command) commands = ['ls -l', 'echo "Hello World!"', 'mkdir test'] execute_commands(commands) ``` The script will execute three commands in sequence, and the output is as follows: ``` total 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 6 Feb 25 14:36 test Hello World! ```
