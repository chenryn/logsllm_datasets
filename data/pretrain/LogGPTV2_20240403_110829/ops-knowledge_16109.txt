User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题openVPN VM server (client stuck) I have a setup where PFsense is forwarding 9049 to this openVPN VM.
(I have other port forwarding going on and outside is able to access those).
Trying to implement layer-2-tap mode instead of layer-3-tun mode.

[server.conf]

port 9049

proto udp
dev tap

ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
cert /etc/openvpn/server.crt
key /etc/openvpn/server.key  

tls-server
tls-auth ta.key 0

dh /etc/openvpn/dh2048.pem

push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

push "dhcp-option DNS 84.200.69.80"
push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"

client-to-client

keepalive 15 60

user nobody
group nobody

persist-tun

server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0

Assistant: I had this problem and solved it

The problem was the clinet configuration file and the server configuration file

Using default configuration files, my problem was resolved
