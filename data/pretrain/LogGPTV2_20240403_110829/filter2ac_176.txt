**Guidelines:**

1. **Enable the Hardened Runtime Capability:** When developing applications, ensure that the Hardened Runtime capability is enabled. This feature provides additional security by enforcing runtime protections and code signing requirements.

2. **Avoid Including the `com.apple.security.get-task-allow` Entitlement:** Do not include the `com.apple.security.get-task-allow` entitlement with any value set to a variation of `true`. This entitlement, when enabled, allows other processes to attach to your application for debugging purposes, which can be a security risk in a production environment.

By following these guidelines, you can enhance the security and robustness of your applications.
