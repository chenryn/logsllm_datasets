A Propositions and Lemmas
For the sake of completeness, and for the reader’s convenience,
we present here the lemmas and propositions used in Section 5
to support the privacy and security analysis of our solution.
√
Lemma A.1 (Lemma 1 in CKKS [35]). The encryption
hN. If
noise is bounded by Bclean=8
ccc←Encpppkkk(m) and m←Ecd(zzz,∆) for some zzz∈Z[i]N/2 and
∆>N+2Bclean, then Dcd(Decssskkk(ccc))=zzz.
Ecd(., .) (resp. Dcd(.)) is the encoding (resp. decoding) func-
tion, ∆ the scaling factor, and h the Hamming weight of ssskkk.
Lemma A.2 (Lemma 4 in BDOP [14]). Assume the distribu-
tion D and that Rq, m are chosen such that: 1) the min-entropy
of a vector drawn from D is at least (k +1)log|Rq|+κ, where
κ is a (statistical) security parameter, and 2) the class of func-
tions { fa|a∈Rm
q } where fa(r)=a· r is universal when map-
ping the support of D to Rq. Then, the scheme is statistically
hiding.
Recall that D denotes the distribution of an honest prover’s
randomness for commitments.
Lemma A.3 (Lemma 10 in BDOP [14]). The protocol
ΠBound has the following properties:
• Correctness: The veriﬁer always accepts an honest
prover when the protocol does not abort. The probability
of abort is at most 2/γ + 2/γx.
• Special soundness: On input a commitment ccc and a pair
aux,ttt(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48),z(cid:48),rrr(cid:48)
of transcripts (ccc,d, (caux,ttt,z,rrrz)), (ccc,d(cid:48), (c(cid:48)
z))
where d(cid:54)=d(cid:48), we can extract either a witness for breaking
the auxiliary commitment scheme, or a valid opening of
ccc where the message x has norm at most γxNβx.
• Honest-veriﬁer zero-knowledge: Executions of protocol
ΠBound with an honest veriﬁer can be simulated with
statistically indistinguishable distribution.
We remind that γ is a constant that regulates the abort prob-
ability, γx a constant piloting the norm of zzz, and βx an upper
bound on the norm of possible x.
Lemma A.4 (Lemma 3 in BDOP [14]). From a commitment
ccc and correct openings rrr, f , rrr(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), f (cid:48) to two different message
vectors xxx, xxx(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), one can efﬁciently compute a solution sss with
(cid:107)sss(cid:107)∞ ≤ 2Nmγβγ2
D to the Ring-SIS problem instance deﬁned
by the top row of AAA1.
Proposition A.1 (Proposition 4.2 in ZKBoo [55]). The ZK-
Boo protocol is a Σ-protocol for the relation RΦ with 3-special
soundness.
