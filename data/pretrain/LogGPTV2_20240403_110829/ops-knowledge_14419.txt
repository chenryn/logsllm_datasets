User: Please introduce common load balancing algorithms and which algorithm should be selected under what circumstances.
Assistant: Common load balancing algorithms include the following: 1. Round Robin The round robin algorithm is the most basic algorithm, which distributes requests to different servers in turn. The advantage of the polling algorithm is that it is simple and easy to implement, and the implementation cost is low; the disadvantage is that it cannot adapt to the actual load conditions of different servers. It is suitable for situations where the server performance is equivalent and the processing time is the same. 2. Weighted Round Robin (Weighted Round Robin) Weighted Round Robin adds the concept of weight to the round robin algorithm, and the number of requests allocated to different servers is proportional to the weight. Useful when there are large differences between servers. 3. Random algorithm (Random) The random algorithm randomly assigns requests to servers, and there is no counter for the number of requests. The advantage is that it is simple and easy to implement; the disadvantage is that the randomness cannot be predicted, and it is difficult to guarantee the load balancing effect. It is suitable for situations where the request volume is not large and the server performance is similar. 4. The Least Connections algorithm (Least Connections) The Least Connections algorithm determines whether to allocate a request to a server based on the actual number of connections, and allocates the request to the server with the least number of current connections. The advantage is that it can monitor the load of the server in real time, and is suitable for applications with long connections and large calculations. 5. IP Hash Algorithm (IP Hash) The IP Hash algorithm generates a result through the hash algorithm of the client's IP address, and then selects a server to process the request according to the algorithm. Requests for the same IP address will definitely be assigned to the same server. Applicable to the situation where the IP address of the client remains unchanged and the number of clients is small. Which algorithm to choose depends on the application scenario of load balancing. For applications that require extremely high performance and reliability, a combined algorithm can be used to combine multiple load balancing algorithms to achieve better results. Similarly, for distributed applications, software or hardware load balancing devices can be used for implementation.
