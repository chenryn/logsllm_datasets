User:  How to develop collaboratively on GitHub?
Assistant: The following steps can be followed for collaborative development on GitHub: 1. Create a GitHub account, and create a new warehouse on GitHub, and set the warehouse to be accessed and edited by others. 2. Invite other developers to join the warehouse and assign warehouse permissions. 3. Perform code upload and version management on GitHub, and implement version control and collaborative development through pull request and other mechanisms. 4. Use the issue function on GitHub or other communication tools for team collaboration and communication. If necessary, use the wiki function on GitHub or other online document collaboration tools for document collaboration. It should be noted that when conducting collaborative development on GitHub, it is necessary to formulate detailed code management specifications and processes, such as code branch management, code upload process, etc., to ensure the efficiency and code quality of collaborative development.
