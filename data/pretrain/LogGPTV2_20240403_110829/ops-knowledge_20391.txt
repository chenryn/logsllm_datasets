Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode process receiving blocks of size 67108864 from various sources, as well as the FSNamesystem process allocating and adding stored blocks to the blockMap. Additionally, the DataBlockScanner process is verifying a block and the PacketResponder process is terminating.
