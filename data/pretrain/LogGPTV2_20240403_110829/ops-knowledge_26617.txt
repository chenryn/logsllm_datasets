User: I am currently using linux. I have a python script which I want to run as a background service such as the script should start to run when I start my machine. 
Currently I am using python 2.7 and the command 'python myscripy.py' to run the script.
Can anyone give an idea about how to do this.
Thank you.
Assistant: You can create init script in /etc/init/ directory
Example:



    start on runlevel [2345]
    stop on runlevel [!2345]
    kill timeout 5
    respawn

    script
       exec /usr/bin/python /path/to/script.py
    end script



Save with .conf extension
