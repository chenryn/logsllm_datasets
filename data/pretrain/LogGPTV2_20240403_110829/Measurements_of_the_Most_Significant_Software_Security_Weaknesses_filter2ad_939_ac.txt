described with the pillar, but it appears in the list because there is a
set of severe CVEs described with its children (see subsection 6.5).
Our MSSW base list is comprised of 17 bases, the variants CWE-416
(rank 7) and CWE-415 (rank 14), and the compound CWE-352 (rank
10) – see Table 3. Each of the two lists properly compare items of the
same kind. Interestingly but not surprisingly, each CWE from the
base list is a child of a CWE from class list. However, the ordering
of these parent-child pairs are not necessarily preserved between
the two lists.
6.2 Set Differences
There are differences in the set of CWEs covered by our top 20
MSSW class and base lists and the MDSE list. The pillars/classes
in the MDSE list that do not appear in the class list are: CWE-200
and CWE-732. The bases/variants/compounds in the MDSE list that
do not appear in the base list are: CWE-79, CWE-476, CWE-772,
CWE-426, and CWE-295. The base list contains base CWE-120 (a
child of CWE-119), which does not appear in the MDSE list.
Note that the two classes from the MDSE list with children in the
same list are also in the class list (emphasizing their importance):
class CWE-119 with children base CWE-125 and base CWE-787, and
class CWE-287 with children base CWE-798 and base CWE-295.

6.3 Reordered Rankings
The relative orderings in the MDSE list often do not match the
orderings in the MSSW class and base lists. There are some notable
reorderings. CWE-89 (Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection)
and CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) climb up in the
base list due to their highest severities of 8.89 and 9.01. CWE-913
(Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources) does
not even appear in the MDSE Top 25 list, as it has only three direct
occurrences in the CVEs. However, it climbs up to first position in
the class list due to its highest severity of 8.81 and its 188 propa-
gated occurrences. Its main child contributor is base CWE-502 with
frequency of 83 and severity of 9.01. CWE-119 (Improper Restric-
tion of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) in the
MDSE list, while widely used with 2745 propagated occurrences in
the CVEs, is quite less severe than CWE-913 and drops to rank 2 in
the MSSW class list.
