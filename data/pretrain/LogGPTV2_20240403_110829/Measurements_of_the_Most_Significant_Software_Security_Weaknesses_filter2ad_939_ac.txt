### 6.1 Overview of the MSSW Base List

The MSSW base list consists of 17 bases, including CWE-416 (rank 7) and CWE-415 (rank 14), as well as the compound CWE-352 (rank 10). Each item in the two lists is compared with others of the same type. Notably, each CWE in the base list is a child of a CWE from the class list. However, the parent-child orderings are not always preserved between the two lists. For example, while a CWE may be listed under a specific pillar, it may appear in the list due to a set of severe CVEs associated with its children (see subsection 6.5).

### 6.2 Set Differences

There are differences in the CWEs covered by our top 20 MSSW class and base lists and the MDSE list. The pillars/classes in the MDSE list that do not appear in our class list include CWE-200 and CWE-732. The bases/variants/compounds in the MDSE list that are absent from our base list are: CWE-79, CWE-476, CWE-772, CWE-426, and CWE-295. Conversely, our base list includes CWE-120 (a child of CWE-119), which is not present in the MDSE list.

It is worth noting that the two classes from the MDSE list with children in the same list are also included in our class list, underscoring their importance. These are:
- Class CWE-119 with children CWE-125 and CWE-787.
- Class CWE-287 with children CWE-798 and CWE-295.

### 6.3 Reordered Rankings

The relative orderings in the MDSE list often differ from those in the MSSW class and base lists. Some notable reorderings include:
- CWE-89 (Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection) and CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) rise in the base list due to their high severities of 8.89 and 9.01, respectively.
- CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources) does not appear in the MDSE Top 25 list, as it has only three direct occurrences in the CVEs. However, it ranks first in the class list due to its highest severity of 8.81 and 188 propagated occurrences. Its main child contributor is CWE-502, with a frequency of 83 and a severity of 9.01.
- CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is widely used with 2745 propagated occurrences in the CVEs but is less severe than CWE-913, dropping to rank 2 in the MSSW class list.
