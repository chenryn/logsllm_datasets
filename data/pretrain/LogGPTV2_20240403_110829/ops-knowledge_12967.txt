User: I'm having a lot of trouble getting Eclipse to recognise PyDev when using the PyDev zip file. (I need to use the zip file as the Dev machine does not have internet access).
I have Eclipse installed and have downloaded the PyDev zip. I've Googled a fair bit and tried the following based on suggestions I found:-

Unzipped the .zip into ECLIPSE/helios/dropins and restarted eclipse.
Unzipped the .zip into ECLIPSE/helios/plugins and restarted eclipse.

Neither makes Python appear as a selection in the Eclipse, Window, Preferences.
Helios contains the executable eclipse file I use to load eclipse.
I'm using eclipse in Redhat linux.
One suggestion was to extract the zip over the eclipse plugins and features folders, but I don't see how that would work as the zip just produces a heap of files and no folders.
Any help to get this working would be great.
Assistant: I've been playing with PyDev and Eclipse. Reinstalled Eclipse on a fresh machine and unzipped the standard PyDev over it (not the source version) and it worked fine. Did the same thing on the same machine having the problems but in a different location (/home) also worked fine. So it looks like a configuration problem on the machine not a PyDev/Eclipse issue. Sorry for the run around and thanks for the help. Dog.
