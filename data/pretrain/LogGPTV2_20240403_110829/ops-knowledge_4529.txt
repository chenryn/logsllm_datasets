User: I know Twisted is a framework that allows you to do asynchronous non-blocking i/o but I still do not understand how that is different from what Apache server does. If anyone could explain the need for twisted, I would appreciate it..
Assistant: @alphazero You read that Twisted vs. Tornado benchmark wrong (or you didn't read it at all).  Quote from the article: " Lower mean response time is better." Twisted is lower.  People want their webservers to respond with lower (faster) times.
Twisted leaves Tornado in the dust... or, in reality, they differ by a nearly trivial constant factor.
