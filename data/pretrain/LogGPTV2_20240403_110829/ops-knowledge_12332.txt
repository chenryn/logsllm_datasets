User: How to use Docker to create containers and deploy applications into containers?
Assistant: The following are the steps to create a container with Docker and deploy the application into the container: 1. Install Docker and start the Docker engine. 2. Write a Dockerfile, specify the base image, install the application, set the environment variables, etc. For example: ``` FROM ubuntu:latest RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx ENV PORT 80 EXPOSE 80 CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"] ``` 3. In In the directory where the Dockerfile is located, execute the following command to build the image: ``` docker build -t my-nginx . ``` Wherein, my-nginx is the name of the image. 4. Create a container and run the image: ``` docker run -d --name my-nginx-container -p 80:80 my-nginx ``` Where, my-nginx-container is the name of the container, -p 80: 80 is used to map port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container, and my-nginx is the name of the image. 5. Check the running status of the container: ``` docker ps ``` You can see that my-nginx-container is running. 6. Access the application in the container: Enter the IP address or domain name of the host machine in the browser to access the nginx server in the container. The above are the steps to create a container using Docker and deploy the application into the container.
