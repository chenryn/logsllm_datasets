### Evaluating Anycast and DNS-Based Redirection in a Large CDN

#### Introduction
In this section, we evaluate the performance of both ECS (EDNS Client Subnet) and LDNS (Local DNS) client grouping for prediction. Due to engineering constraints, our sampling rate is limited, which restricts our ability to make predictions at finer timescales.

#### Front-End Affinity Analysis
**Figure 7: Cumulative Fraction of Clients Switching Front-ends Over a Week**

- **Day 1:** Within the first day, 7% of clients landed on multiple front-ends.
- **Subsequent Days:** An additional 2-4% of clients experienced a front-end change each day until the weekend, where churn was minimal (<0.5%).
- **Weekend to Week Start:** The churn increased again to 2-4% each day from the weekend to the beginning of the week.
- **Weekly Summary:** Across the entire week, 21% of clients landed on multiple front-ends, but the majority remained stable.

We observe that the number of client front-end switches is slightly higher in a one-day snapshot compared to the 1.1-4.7% reported in previous work on DNS instance-switches in anycast root nameservers [20, 33]. This discrepancy is likely due to our anycast deployment being approximately ten times larger than the number of instances present in the K root name server at the time of that study.

**Figure 8: Change in Client-to-Front-End Distance When Front-End Changes**

- **Distance Change:** The median change in distance from front-end switches is 483 km, with 83% of changes within 2000 km.
- **Geographic Density:** This pattern aligns with the high density of CDN front-ends in North America and Europe.

#### Performance Comparison
Most clients exhibit high front-end affinity, consistently accessing the same front-end over time. For those that do switch, there is a long tail of distances between the client and the new front-end.

#### DNS-Based Redirection
**Figure 9: Improvement Over Anycast Using LDNS or ECS-Based Decisions with Prediction**

- **ECS-Based Prediction:**
  - **Performance Difference:** The "EDNS-0" lines in Figure 9 show the distribution of performance differences between the predicted front-end and the anycast-routed front-end.
  - **Results:** For nearly 40% of query-weighted prefixes, we predict an improvement over anycast. However, only 30% see actual performance improvements, while 10% experience worse performance.
  
- **LDNS-Based Prediction:**
  - **Latency Mapping:** We construct a latency map from LDNS to each measured edge by assigning front-end measurements to the client's LDNS.
  - **Results:** The "LDNS" lines in Figure 9 indicate that around 27% of weighted /24s see improvement, but 17% experience a penalty due to poor predictions.

#### Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that traditional and recent DNS techniques can improve performance for many clients experiencing suboptimal anycast routing. A hybrid approach combining anycast with DNS-based redirection may offer better performance and scalability, especially for clients not well represented by their LDNS.
