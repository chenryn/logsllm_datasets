had a “cottage industry” writing speeches for someone a lot less significant than agency 
directors and know that it takes getting inside the skin of another and articulating their 
positions in their own voice.) That is what Hasler tries and mostly accomplishes with her 
delineation of the culture of Utorb and the Halfsheep. I say “mostly” because the fabric 
weakens from time to time, the construction is sometimes cerebral rather than 
imaginative, it is thought, that is, then written, translated from ideas rather than spoken in 
the native tongue of the culture and species and embodied in images and dramatic events.  
That imperfect accomplishment suggests something demanded by real counter-
intelligence – the understanding of humans from another culture, another thought world, 
and getting inside them, working them from the inside out. That task is always 
imperfectly achieved, however native we go.  So if that’s a flaw in the book, it is because 
4 
the reach – to another planetary culture entirely, to a personal history that is genuinely 
“other” – is so far, as the author attempts to intertwine the story of the alien with the 
stories of all the other “others” in the book.  
The psychiatrist Lee is assigned to observe a male protagonist, Lloyd, who was 
traumatized by torture, making him a hybrid of a manly-type man and a damaged and 
abused human i.e. a “womanly” man in terms of the metaphors of the book (“I’d rather be 
on the side of the human spirit,” he says, identifying the ethos that ultimately competes 
with abuse). Lloyd’s sister Trudie understands the alien straightaway, in part because her 
own primary relationship has taught her empathy beyond the norm. Trudie has to learn a 
strategy to liberate herself from the derision and contempt of a man whose cruelty would 
be cartoonish if it wasn’t on the front pages (or web sites) every day.  
So yes, abusive relationships characterize most relationships in the book, one way or 
another, whether it is a superior berating  and demeaning a direct report, men 
contemptuous of women, or the treatment of an alien subjected to horrendous 
experiments in order to learn what Communists (we thought) were doing to brainwash 
Americans. That latter thread treats our early attempts to do that – Projects Bluebird, 
Artichoke (thinly disguised here as “Asparagus”), MK Ultra and more. Those 
experiments, we know now, were ironic, in that the Communists had no secret method of 
brainwashing, but used brutal techniques synchronous with their military and political 
cultures. The effort to duplicate their techniques was also ironic in two other ways – (1) it 
parallels the CIA’s appointment of itself as an ad hoc “ministry of culture” to covertly 
create and sustain books, magazines, movies, art expositions, media of every kind, to 
show the superiority of a free and open society, but (ironically) executed covertly and 
secretly, and (2) the creation of severe training regimens to accustom Americans to 
torture, using methods that were not used by anyone else, but which became our methods 
to interrogate prisoners in the war on terror when their inventor was charged with that 
interrogation.   
The recitation of the details of the use of powerful drugs on unsuspecting subjects–the 
CIA, after all, brought us LSD - is safe because so much time has passed, so there is no 
worry about accountability for those actions. Verisimilitude is enhanced by the casual 
mention of, for example, Frank Olson (called “Fred Ogden” in the book) who died as a 
result of a long plunge from a high window after he was fed LSD. That story can be 
referenced because we know about it now, and accountability is moot, since we know 
that attempts by the family to sue the government for damages have never availed.  In 
fact, they never do. 
One particularly humorous account that resonates with “what everybody knows” is a 
story of the “Roswell event,” here depicted as a red herring created from whole cloth as 
an act of misdirection (“look over here while we really recover an alien there”). The 
method if not the particular event is absolutely solid and common practice in operations 
of cover and deception. In the context of the story, it is one big funny “dot” which cannot 
be connected to other dots, a linkage UFOlogists seek, without success.  The anecdote 
5 
also suggests the real extent of what organizations with prodigious resources can do to 
create illusions and misdirection. 
Reviewing “Intelligence,” I noted that anger at political expediency both inside and 
outside the agency was ever present, and I have to return to that fact. Lee is angry too, 
made so by continuous marginalization, and so is Trudie, but the Halfsheep’s angry 
response is mitigated by different cultural and biological structures.  As the alien comes 
to understand both the intermittent light of the human spirit, interspersed with prolonged 
periods of torment, the reader grows in the realization that we and the alien do have a 
common shared “humanity.” “Humanity” in that sense transcends species and forms of 
intelligent life.  
I can only infer that Hasler sustained her own “humanity” in a somewhat similar way. 
Her 23 years at CIA resulted in a strong no-nonsense woman who learned the value of 
telling it like it is (and the futility of holding anything back), a woman who had to 
balance the higher motives of a career in intelligence with the facts of life on the ground 
(or underground in “the mines”) – who had to learn how to be a woman in a culture that 
did not treat women well (see e.g. “CIA Disciplines 15 Officers in Harassment Cases” an 
AP story on June 10 2014). She had to achieve that balance and still do excellent work. 
So she must have had at least two personas – she was at once the “other” who had to 
learn to be effective without sacrificing her own humanity in the process AND she was 
an analyst and speechwriter who had to understand deeply the “others” in her culture 
(men, for example, with all that assumption of privilege brought) and terrorists bent on 
doing horrific things to “us, our family and friends,” which defines the identity of who 
must be protected.  It is difficult NOT to dehumanize terrorists in light of what they 
execute and plan. The high stakes of failure to prevent attacks can make one willing to do 
whatever is necessary to achieve those ends. No one who has not been in that particular 
trench can understand what that responsibility and knowledge generates in a human 
being. So it must have been a balancing act, and a psychological and spiritual challenge, 
to get inside the skin of the “enemy” and see the world through their eyes, which meant at 
the same time assimilating a deep knowledge of their humanity, the humanity of the 
“other,” which creates sympathy that must be transcended to stay on task. The allegiance 
to country, tribe, and clan, to the agency, to the task at hand had to be balanced against 
allegiance to humanity itself, to the “side of the human spirit,” and to the overarching 
commonality of the best and the worst in humans in this world and others.  
Did I mention that the journey down these rabbit holes is enjoyable for the reader? The 
book is often delightful to read, however mitigated by serious issues. The reader steps 
back from a seemingly sci-fi work to reflect on how this is not just sci-fi after all, or if it 
is, it is sci-fi as metaphor for current challenges to the human spirit. Science fiction is, 
after all, how left brain societies dream of their futures. 
It is not in the foreground of most people’s thoughts, that the challenge of confronting 
aliens not from south of the border but from other planetary civilizations and negotiating 
a common understanding in light of our obvious inferiority to more advanced cultures – 
that’s real, and that will be a primary challenge in this century. The encounter with the 
6 
other – other kinds of humans, other kinds of intelligent feeling beings – must engage us, 
like it or not, and a good way to start to do that, if you haven’t already, is by reading this 
book. The themes are not trivial.  Hasler does as well as one can, describing a culture that 
is not ours and the kinds of beings it might produce over a long and different history. She 
does so on behalf of all the beings who ally with the human spirit and the more-than-
human spirit. By the end of the book, our understanding of the alien has become by proxy 
a journey toward a sense of kinship with the whole web of sentient life spun throughout 
the galaxies, and it reveals by contrast just how plain dumb we often are about that most 
of the time.  
So the book is a journey from hierarchical structures of domination and control to 
learning how to live in networks and webs, in which presence and participation at nodes 
are the sources of our real power. That power is intrinsic to our humanity and is 
inviolable, and the only thing enemies of the human spirit can do is convince us we don’t 
have it, so we won’t use it. Lloyd, Lee, Trudie, and the Halfsheep all transcend the people 
and systemic dynamics that assault their shared humanity to learn how to exercise that 
power with courage, dignity, and when the chips are down, genuine heroism.
