FAMILY: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY 
[FIPS 200] specifies the System and Information Integrity minimum security requirement as 
follows: 
Organizations must: (i) identify, report, and correct information and information system 
flaws in a timely manner; (ii) provide protection from malicious code at appropriate 
locations within organizational information systems; and (iii) monitor information 
system security alerts and advisories and take appropriate actions in response.  
System and information integrity for systems and components traversing the supply chain is 
critical for managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The insertion of malicious 
code and counterfeits are two primary examples of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply 
chain, both of which can at least partially be addressed by deploying system and information 
integrity controls. Enterprises should ensure that adequate system and information integrity 
protections are part of C-SCRM. 
SI-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should include C-SCRM in system and information 
integrity policy and procedures, including ensuring that program-specific requirements for employing 
various integrity verification tools and techniques are clearly defined. System and information integrity for 
information systems, components, and the underlying information systems and networks is critical for 
managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The insertion of malicious code and counterfeits 
are two primary examples of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, both of which can be at least 
partially addressed by deploying system and information integrity controls.

FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE AND FIRMWARE UPDATES  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should specify the various software assets within its 
information systems and networks that require automated updates (both indirect and direct). This 
specification of assets should be defined from criticality analysis results, which provide information on 
critical and non-critical functions and components (see Section 2 and Appendix C). A centralized patch 
management process may be employed for evaluating and managing updates prior to deployment. 
Those software assets that require direct updates from a supplier should only accept updates that 
originate directly from the OEM unless specifically deployed by the acquirer, such as with a 
centralized patch management process. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to

MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Because the majority of code operated in federal systems is not 
developed by the Federal Government, malicious code threats often originate from the supply chain. This 
controls applies to the federal agency and contractors with code-related responsibilities (e.g., developing 
code, installing patches, performing system upgrades, etc.), as well as applicable contractor information 
systems and networks. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and 
flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to

SYSTEM MONITORING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: This control includes monitoring vulnerabilities that result from past 
supply chain cybersecurity compromises, such as malicious code implanted during software development 
and set to activate after deployment. System monitoring is frequently performed by external service 
providers. Service-level agreements with these providers should be structured to appropriately reflect this 
control. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to 
implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should evaluate security alerts, advisories, and directives 
for cybersecurity supply chain impacts and follow up if needed. US-CERT, FASC, and other authoritative 
entities generate security alerts and advisories that are applicable to C-SCRM. Additional laws and 
regulations will impact who and how additional advisories are provided. Enterprises should ensure that 
their information-sharing protocols and processes include sharing alerts, advisories, and directives with 
relevant parties with whom they have an agreement to deliver products or perform services. Enterprises 
should provide direction or guidance as to what actions are to be taken in response to sharing such an alert, 
advisory, or directive. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow 
down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix

SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: This control applies to the federal agency and applicable supplier 
products, applications, information systems, and networks. The integrity of all applicable systems and 
networks should be systematically tested and verified to ensure that it remains as required so that the 
systems/components traversing through the supply chain are not impacted by unanticipated changes. The 
integrity of systems and components should also be tested and verified. Applicable verification tools 
include digital signature or checksum verification; acceptance testing for physical components; confining 
software to limited privilege environments, such as sandboxes; code execution in contained environments 
prior to use; and ensuring that if only binary or machine-executable code is available, it is obtained directly 
from the OEM or a verified supplier or distributer. Mechanisms for this control are discussed in detail in 
[NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. This control applies to federal agencies and applicable supplier information 
systems and networks. When purchasing an ICT/OT product, an enterprise should perform due diligence to 
understand what a supplier’s integrity assurance practices are. Enterprises should require their prime 
contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. 
Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with

FAMILY: SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT 
[FIPS 200] does not specify Supply Chain Risk Management minimum security requirements.  
[NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] established a new control family: Supply Chain Risk Management. 
The supplemental guidance below expands upon the SR controls and provides further 
information and context for their application. This is a new family in SP 800-53, Rev. 5, and 
guidance already exists in that publication. This document (NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1) includes 
all SR control enhancements from SP 800-53, Rev. 5, and the following SR controls and control 
enhancements have been added to NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 [SR-13]. Readers should consult 
NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 SR controls together with the controls in this section.

POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: C-SCRM policies are developed at Level 1 for the overall enterprise and 
at Level 2 for specific missions and functions. C-SCRM policies can be implemented at Levels 1, 2, and 3, 
depending on the level of depth and detail. C-SCRM procedures are developed at Level 2 for specific 
missions and functions and at Level 3 for specific systems. Enterprise functions including but not limited to 
information security, legal, risk management, and acquisition should review and concur on the 
development of C-SCRM policies and procedures or provide guidance to system owners for developing 
system-specific C-SCRM procedures.

SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: C-SCRM plans describe implementations, requirements, constraints, 
and implications at the system level. C-SCRM plans are influenced by the enterprise’s other risk 
assessment activities and may inherit and tailor common control baselines defined at Level 1 and Level 2.  
C-SCRM plans defined at Level 3 work in collaboration with the enterprise’s C-SCRM Strategy and 
Policies (Level 1 and Level 2) and the C-SCRM Implementation Plan (Level 1 and Level 2) to provide a 
systematic and holistic approach for cybersecurity supply chain risk management across the enterprise.  
C-SCRM plans should be developed as a standalone document and only integrated into existing system 
security plans if enterprise constraints require it.

SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROLS AND PROCESSES | SUB-TIER FLOW DOWN 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this 
control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors throughout the SDLC. The use 
of the acquisition process provides an important vehicle to protect the supply chain. As part of 
procurement requirements, enterprises should include the need for suppliers to flow down controls to 
subcontractors throughout the SDLC. As part of market research and analysis activities, enterprises 
should conduct robust due diligence research on potential suppliers or products, as well as their 
upstream dependencies (e.g., fourth- and fifth-party suppliers), which can help enterprises avoid single 
points of failure within their supply chains. The results of this research can be helpful in shaping the 
sourcing approach and refining requirements. An evaluation of the cybersecurity risks that arise from a 
supplier, product, or service should be completed prior to the contract award decision to ensure that the 
holistic risk profile is well-understood and serves as a weighted factor in award decisions. During the 
period of performance, suppliers should be monitored for conformance to the defined controls and 
requirements, as well as changes in risk conditions. See Section 3 for guidance on the Role of C-
SCRM in the Acquisition Process. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
SR-4 
PROVENANCE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Provenance should be documented for systems, system components, and 
associated data throughout the SDLC. Enterprises should consider producing SBOMs for applicable and 
appropriate classes of software, including purchased software, open source software, and in-house 
software. SBOMs should be produced using only NTIA-supported SBOM formats that can satisfy [NTIA 
SBOM] EO 14028 NTIA minimum SBOM elements. Enterprises producing SBOMs should use [NTIA 
SBOM] minimum SBOM elements as framing for the inclusion of primary components. SBOMs should be 
digitally signed using a verifiable and trusted key. SBOMs can play a critical role in enabling organizations 
to maintain provenance. However, as SBOMs mature, organizations should ensure they do not deprioritize 
existing C-SCRM capabilities (e.g., vulnerability management practices, vendor risk assessments) under 
the mistaken assumption that SBOM replaces these activities. SBOMs and the improved transparency that 
they are meant to provide for organizations are a complementary, not substitutive, capability. Organizations 
that are unable to appropriately ingest, analyze, and act on the data that SBOMs provide likely will not 
improve their overall C-SCRM posture. Federal agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this 
guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity.

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENTS AND REVIEWS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: In general, an enterprise should consider any information pertinent to 
the security, integrity, resilience, quality, trustworthiness, or authenticity of the supplier or their provided 
services or products. Enterprises should consider applying this information against a consistent set of core 
baseline factors and assessment criteria to facilitate equitable comparison (between suppliers and over 
time). Depending on the specific context and purpose for which the assessment is being conducting, the 
enterprise may select additional factors. The quality of information (e.g., its relevance, completeness, 
accuracy, etc.) relied upon for an assessment is also an important consideration. Reference sources for 
assessment information should also be documented. The C-SCRM PMO can help define requirements, 
methods, and tools for the enterprise’s supplier assessments. Departments and agencies should refer to 
Appendix E for further guidance concerning baseline risk factors and the documentation of assessments 
and Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity.

SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS SECURITY 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The C-SCRM PMO can help determine OPSEC controls that apply to 
specific missions and functions. OPSEC controls are particularly important when there is specific concern 
about an adversarial threat from or to the enterprise’s supply chain or an element within the supply chain, 
or when the nature of the enterprise’s mission or business operations, its information, and/or its 
service/product offerings make it a more attractive target for an adversarial threat.

Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should inspect critical systems and components, at a 
minimum, for assurance that tamper resistance controls are in place and to examine whether there is 
evidence of tampering. Products or components should be inspected prior to use and periodically thereafter. 
Inspection requirements should also be included in contracts with suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Enterprises should require 
their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier 
contractors and flow down to subcontractors, when relevant.  
Criticality analysis can help determine which systems and components are critical and should therefore be 
subjected to inspection. See Section 2, Appendix C, and RA-9 for guidance on conducting criticality 
analysis. The C-SCRM PMO can help identify critical systems and components, especially those that are

PMO. The policy and procedures should address regulatory compliance requirements, contract 
requirements or clauses, and counterfeit reporting processes to enterprises, such as GIDEP and/or other 
appropriate enterprises. Where applicable and appropriate, the policy should also address the development 
and use of a qualified bidders list (QBL) and/or qualified manufacturers list (QML). This helps prevent 
counterfeits through the use of authorized suppliers, wherever possible, and their integration into the 
organization’s supply chain [CISA SCRM WG3]. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to
