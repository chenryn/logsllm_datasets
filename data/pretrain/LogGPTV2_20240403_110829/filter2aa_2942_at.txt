#### SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY

[FIPS 200] specifies the System and Information Integrity minimum security requirement as follows:

1. **Identification, Reporting, and Correction of Flaws**: Organizations must identify, report, and correct information and information system flaws in a timely manner.
2. **Protection from Malicious Code**: Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within organizational information systems.
3. **Monitoring Security Alerts and Advisories**: Monitor information system security alerts and advisories and take appropriate actions in response.

**System and Information Integrity in the Supply Chain:**
Ensuring the integrity of systems and components throughout the supply chain is crucial for managing cybersecurity risks. Two primary examples of such risks are the insertion of malicious code and counterfeits. These can be partially mitigated by deploying system and information integrity controls. Enterprises should ensure that adequate protections are part of their C-SCRM strategy.

**SI-1: POLICY AND PROCEDURES**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Include C-SCRM in system and information integrity policy and procedures. Clearly define program-specific requirements for employing various integrity verification tools and techniques.

- **Levels**: 1, 2, 3

**SI-7: SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Apply this control to federal agencies and applicable supplier products, applications, information systems, and networks. Test and verify the integrity of all applicable systems and networks. Use digital signature or checksum verification, acceptance testing, sandboxing, and other methods. Obtain binary or machine-executable code directly from the OEM or verified source.
- **Levels**: 2, 3
- **Related Controls**: SR-3(3)

**Control Enhancement(s):**
- **SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | BINARY OR MACHINE EXECUTABLE CODE**
  - **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Obtain binary or machine-executable code directly from the OEM/developer or other verified source.
  - **Levels**: 2, 3

- **SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CODE AUTHENTICATION**
  - **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Implement code authentication mechanisms, such as digital signatures, to ensure the integrity of software, firmware, and information.
  - **Levels**: 3

**SI-12: INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND RETENTION**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Include C-SCRM in information management and retention requirements, especially for sensitive and proprietary information of system integrators, suppliers, or external service providers.
- **Levels**: 3

**SI-20: TAINTING**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers may have access to sensitive federal agency information. Require prime contractors to implement this control and flow down the requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.
- **Levels**: 2, 3
- **Related Controls**: SR-9

#### SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT (SR)

[FIPS 200] does not specify Supply Chain Risk Management minimum security requirements. [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] established a new control family: Supply Chain Risk Management. The supplemental guidance below expands upon the SR controls and provides further information and context for their application.

**SR-1: POLICY AND PROCEDURES**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Develop C-SCRM policies at Level 1 for the overall enterprise and at Level 2 for specific missions and functions. Implement C-SCRM procedures at Level 2 for specific missions and functions and at Level 3 for specific systems. Review and concur on the development of C-SCRM policies and procedures.
