User: I run python in my Android Terminal and want to run a .py file with:
python /sdcard/myScript.py
The problem is that python is called in my Android enviroment indirect with a shell in my /system/bin/ path (to get it direct accessable via Terminal emulator). 
My exact question, how the title tells how to pass parameter through multiple Shell scripts to Python?
My direct called file "python" in /System/bin/ contains only a redirection like:
sh data/data/com.hipipal.qpyplus/files/bin/qpython-android5.sh
and so on to call python binary.
Edit:
I simply add the $1 parameter after every shell, Python is called through like:
sh data/data/com.hipipal.qpyplus/files/bin/qpython-android5.sh $1
so is possible to call 
python /sdcard/myScript.py arg1
and in myScript.py as usual fetch with sys.argv
thanks
Assistant: I have similar problem. Runing my script from Python console 
/storage/emulator/0/Download/.last_tmp.py -s && exit 
 I am getting "Permission denied". No matter if i am calling last_tmp or edited script itself. 
Is there perhaps any way to pass the params in editor?
