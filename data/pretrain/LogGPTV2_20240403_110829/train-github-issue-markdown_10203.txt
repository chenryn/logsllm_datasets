Subject: Tracking Feature Request for Index-Level TTL

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

Based on discussions within the community, there is a feature request to enable setting a Time To Live (TTL) at the index level, rather than only at the document level. This feature would greatly simplify index maintenance.

For reference, here are two relevant threads from the Elastic Discuss forum:
- [Set a `ttl` value at the index level](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/set-a--ttl-value-at-the-index-level/31668/3)
  - In this thread, Aaron Mildenstein (theuntergeek) mentions that there is currently no index-level TTL, and while there is a feature request for it, he could not recall the specific issue number.
- [Index-level TTL: How do we track this feature request?](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/index-level-ttl-how-do-we-track-this-feature-request/37775)
  - Mark Walkom (warkolm) responded to my inquiry about tracking this feature, suggesting that if anyone finds the feature request, they should link it for the benefit of others. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate it.

I have searched through the issues and features but have not found any specific entry for this feature request. Could someone please point me in the right direction or provide a link to where this feature request is being tracked?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
Casie
