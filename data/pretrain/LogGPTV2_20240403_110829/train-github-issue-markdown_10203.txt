Hi --  
According to what I'm hearing in the community, there is a feature request in
to allow for setting a ttl at the index level rather than only at the doc
level. See here: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/set-a--ttl-value-at-the-index-
level/31668/3 where theuntergeek -- Aaron Mildenstein says "there is no index-
level TTL presently. There's a feature request issue out for it (I forget the
number), but it has not yet been added." and
https://discuss.elastic.co/t/index-level-ttl-how-do-we-track-this-feature-
request/37775 where warkolm (Mark Walkom) responded to my request about how to
track such a feature with "It'd be in here - #1. If you find it, please link
it here so others can benefit ðŸ˜„ (I couldn't find it!)"
I've checked in issues and features and am not finding anything. Can someone
please point me to where to track this feature request? I'm surprised there
isn't more noise about this one, since it would make index maintenance much
simpler.
Thanks,  
Casie
