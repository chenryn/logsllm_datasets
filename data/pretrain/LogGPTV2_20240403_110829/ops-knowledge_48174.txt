User: Please provide the difference between rebase and merge in Git version control.
Assistant: In Git version control, rebase and merge are two commands used to merge code branches. The differences between them are as follows: 1. Rebase will replay the commit history of the entire branch to the target branch, while merge just merges the two The commit histories of the branches are merged together. 2. merge will create a merge commit on the target branch, while rebase will create a series of new commits to overwrite the original commit history. 3. Rebase can make the merged submission history more tidy and intuitive, but at the same time, some information may be lost, such as the submission author information of the rebase branch. 4. Merge is a safe way to merge, because it will not lose any commit history, and rebase may overwrite some important commit information. 5. When merging public branches, merge is the preferred way of merging, because it can preserve the commit history and contributions of each branch. In personal branches and development branches, rebase is more commonly used because it can sort out a more coherent and clean commit history. To sum up, rebase and merge have different applicability, advantages and disadvantages in different scenarios. We need to choose the appropriate combination method according to the specific situation.
