ABSTRACT
We present SEMAGE (SEmantically MAtching imaGEs), a new
image-based CAPTCHA that capitalizes on the human ability to
deﬁne and comprehend image content and to establish semantic re-
lationships between them. A SEMAGE challenge asks a user to se-
lect semantically related images from a given image set. SEMAGE
has a two-factor design where in order to pass a challenge the user is
required to ﬁgure out the content of each image and then understand
and identify semantic relationship between a subset of them. Most
of the current state-of-the-art image-based systems like Assira [20]
only require the user to solve the ﬁrst level, i.e., image recogni-
tion. Utilizing the semantic correlation between images to create
more secure and user-friendly challenges makes SEMAGE novel.
SEMAGE does not suffer from limitations of traditional image-
based approaches such as lacking customization and adaptability.
SEMAGE unlike the current text-based systems is also very user-
friendly with a high fun factor. These features make it very attrac-
tive to web service providers. In addition, SEMAGE is language
independent and highly ﬂexible for customizations (both in terms
of security and usability levels). SEMAGE is also mobile devices
friendly as it does not require the user to type anything. We con-
duct a ﬁrst-of-its-kind large-scale user study involving 174 users to
gauge and compare accuracy and usability of SEMAGE with ex-
isting state-of-the-art CAPTCHA systems like reCAPTCHA (text-
based) [6] and Asirra (image-based) [20]. The user study further
reinstates our points and shows that users achieve high accuracy
using our system and consider our system to be fun and easy.

INTRODUCTION
New web applications and services emerge everyday in all ar-
eas of life. More people are getting used to having online services,
such as email services, forums, and specialized interest groups. For
the service providers, one important aspect to consider is to make
sure that the services and resources are allocated to the targeted
customers. Malicious usage of services, such as using a ‘bot’ to
register legal accounts [9], can take up valuable resources and dis-
tribute malicious information thereafter. Thus it is important for the
service provider to be able to distinguish a bot from human users,
and CAPTCHA systems are widely used for this purpose.
CAPTCHA stands for “Completely Automated Public Tests to
tell Computers and Humans Apart” [29, 28, 27, 15, 9]. The idea
is to introduce a difﬁcult AI problem so that either the purpose of
distinguishing bots and legitimate users is served, or that an AI
breakthrough is achieved [29, 28]. The robustness of CAPTCHA
systems relies not on the secrecy of the database, but on the intrin-
sic difﬁculty of the problem. The difﬁculty of solving a CAPTCHA
problem for a bot and for a human often increases in similar curves.
As CAPTCHA systems are rarely stand-alone and are often inte-
grated as an auxiliary part for applications such as online registra-
tion, it is unrealistic to ask for the user’s concentration for longer
than a few seconds. Hence a complicated challenge requiring the
humans to devote more time would make it unrealistic to be de-
ployed on real world systems.
Identifying distorted letters, answering questions based on im-
ages are a few techniques that are in use to defeat bots, with the
former being the most widespread. However with the increasing
advances in the ﬁeld of computer vision, bots have been known
to break text CAPTCHAs using techniques such as OCR (Optical
Character Recognition) and segmentation [30, 26, 16, 2, 19]. In-
creasing the complexity of the text-based systems by introducing
more noise and distortion to make the challenge difﬁcult for bots
also makes them less user friendly and less usable to normal users.
Image-based systems were then proposed to increase the usabil-
ity of CAPTCHA systems [20, 3, 17, 23, 18, 7, 25, 32]. However,
many current state-of-the-art image-based systems such as Asirra
[20] suffer from the lack of ﬂexibility and adaptability. Assira chal-
lenges focus on image recognition only, requiring the user to iden-
tify all cats among a series of images of cats and dogs. Specialized
attacks using machine learning techniques have achieved a high
rate of success against systems like Asirra, as shown by Golle [22].
Moreover the inherent choice presented to the bot is always binary
(an image is either a cat or a dog), making it more susceptible to
template ﬁtting attacks, which will be further discussed in Section
4.2. We propose SEMAGE, a novel image-based CAPTCHA sys-
tem, which has a two-factor model requiring the user to recognize
the image and identify images that share a semantic relationship.
The introduction of semantic correlation makes SEMAGE more
robust from similar machine learning attacks. Other image-based
systems like ESP-PIX [3] and SQ-PIX [7] are language dependent
and have usability concerns. We survey more CAPTCHA systems
and their limitations in Section 2.
In this paper, we propose SEMAGE (Semantically Matching
Images), a two-factor CAPTCHA system. In SEMAGE, we present
the user with a set of candidate images, out of which a subset of
them would be semantically related. The challenge for the user is
to identify the semantically related images based on the context de-
ﬁned by the system. Note that the images in the correct set need
not be images of the same object, a set of semantically related im-
ages may be images of entities with different physical attributes
but sharing the same meaning in the deﬁned context. Consider for
example the user being asked to identify similar images with the
context being similar images should have the same origin, the can-
didate set could contain images such as a wooden log, a wooden
chair, a matchstick, an electronic item, an animal, and a human,
with the chair, matchstick and log being the similar set.
The challenge in solving a SEMAGE CAPTCHA system is two-
fold: (1) a user has to ﬁgure out the content of the individual im-
ages, i.e., image recognition, (2) and understand the semantic re-
lationships between them and correctly identify the matching im-
ages. This challenge solving ability comes naturally to humans as
humans automatically employ their cognitive ability and common
sense without even realizing the inherent difﬁculty of the task. The
same challenge for a bot would require both understanding images
and identifying relationships between them, constituting a difﬁcult
AI problem. Our two-factor design aims at increasing the difﬁculty
level for a bot and improving usability for humans, without sacri-
ﬁcing the robustness of the system.
What makes SEMAGE novel is the idea of presenting the user
with a two-factor challenge of “identifying images with similar se-
mantics under the given context”. The idea of choosing images
exhibiting semantic similarity has a much broader scope than sim-
ple selection of images of animals of the same species (cats in the
case of Assira). This feature differentiates SEMAGE from other
state-of-the-art image-based CAPTCHAs that only require the user
to solve the ﬁrst level, which is image recognition. Computers are
hard to comprehend and identify the semantic content of an image,
making SEMAGE very robust to bots. We present and discuss what
semantic similarity entails in Section 3.
We also implement one very simpliﬁed sample instance of SEMAGE
using real and cartoon images of animals. The relationship query
asks the user to pick up images (real and cartoon) of the same
species. This particular implementation has two immediate ben-
eﬁts: (1) Adds fun factor for the user without adding burden on the
recognition part since a human can easily make a connection be-
tween a real image of an animal and a cartoon image; (2) Scales up
the difﬁculty level for bots as the cartoon images need not even re-
semble the real physical attributes of the animal. Moreover, SEMAGE
provides an easy-to-operate interface to indicate correct answers
making it an ideal choice for touch-based systems and smart-phones
where typing is more difﬁcult. A sample simpliﬁed SEMAGE chal-
lenge is shown in Figure 1 which illustrates the idea. A human can
easily identify the images marked in a circle as similar but a bot
would not be able to relate the real and cartoon images due to dif-
ference in shape and texture. Note that this is just one way of creat-
ing a SEMAGE challenge. Any other semantic relationship can be
used as the identifying factor apart from our particular simpliﬁed
implementation.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

that has several unique features. The design of a SEMAGE
allows easy tuning of the security level and usability level
depending on the nature and popularity of the website. The
images of the SEMAGE challenges can vary to suit the needs
of different websites. In fact in most cases given a labeled
database it is very easy and intuitive to come up with a def-
inition “semantic relationship” and SEMAGE implementa-
tion. We also provide an in-depth security analysis and show
how SEMAGE is more robust to many attacks than existing
systems.
• We further conduct a large-scale user study with 174 partici-
pants using a simple sample SEMAGE implementation. We
compare our system with state-of-the-art text-based CAPTCHA
system reCAPTCHA [6] and image-based system Asirra [20]
on the metrics of usability and fun factor. As discussed in de-
tails in Section 5, results show that our system is easy to use
and participants reported a high level of ‘fun’ factor.
2. BACKGROUND
CAPTCHA systems, text-based in particular, have been in widespread
use as the ﬁrst line of defense against bots on the web. Recently,
with the improvements in computer vision technology, text-based
systems have become susceptible to bot attacks with a high success
rate [30, 26, 16, 2, 19, 13]. Hence a lot of work has proposed alter-
nate CAPTCHA systems such as image-based [20, 3, 17, 23, 18, 7,
25, 32] and audio-based systems [14, 10, 1, 21].
2.1 Text-based Systems
Generally, text-based CAPTCHA systems ask the user to discern
letters or numbers. GIMPY is one classic example [4]. Attacks on
text-based systems mostly employ OCR (optical character recog-
nition) algorithms. These algorithms ﬁrst segment the images into
small blocks each containing only one letter, and use pattern recog-
nition algorithms to match the letters in each block to standard
letter template features [30, 26, 16]. The later task is considered
a well solved AI problem. In counter-attack to these algorithms,
text-based CAPTCHA systems employ the following techniques to
enhance robustness [15, 19]:
• Adding noises in the form of scattered lines and dots to the
background to counter-attack segmentation algorithms.
• Characters are connected or overlapped so that attacking al-
gorithms cannot correctly segment image into correct blocks.
• Characters are twisted to increase difﬁculty in character recog-
nition.
Figure 2: A text-based CAPTCHA example
However, all the above techniques increase the difﬁculty level
for humans too. Connecting characters together makes the task
harder for humans. For example, when the character ‘r’ and ‘n’ are
connected, it looks like the character ‘m’. Twisted characters not
only gnaw on user’s nerves, but also are sometimes impossible to
identify correctly. Figure 2 shows one such difﬁcult-to-solve text-
based challenge.
Text-base system faces one inevitable situation: humans ﬁnd the
CAPTCHA challenge unpleasant as CAPTCHA gets more compli-
cated. This is probably why popular websites such as MSN hotmail
opted for simple and clean CAPTCHA , which could be attacked
with a success rate over 80% [30]. Some systems use distinctive
color for each character and add colored background using non-
text colors, both of these additions can be easily removed by an
automated program, which add no more difﬁculty for the bot [31].
Popular systems such as ‘reCAPTCHA’ [6] use dictionary words
that are labeled as unrecognizable by real automatic OCR programs
running on real tasks of digitizing books, and evaluate correctness
by other user’s input. However, reCAPTCHA also suffers from
decreased usability and user satisfaction due to the high distortion
and noise in the challenge.
2.2 Audio-based Systems
Audio-based CAPTCHA systems [1, 14, 10, 21] remedy the
fact that visual CAPTCHA systems are not accessible to visually-
impaired people. In a typical audio CAPTCHA system, letters or
digits are presented in randomly spaced intervals, in the form of
audio pronunciation. To make the test more robust against bots,
background noises are added to the audio ﬁles. These systems are
highly dependent on the audio hardware and the user only has a
certain small amount of time to identify each character. In some
sense, audio CAPTCHA systems can be considered as the acoustic
version of text-based systems. Although the visual cues are re-
placed with acoustic cues and the algorithms vary, the underlying
idea of attacking is the same - features are extracted and classiﬁed
to recognize the letters [12]. The difﬁculty curve for bot and hu-
mans are similar. Thus audio CAPTCHA systems provided neither
more user-friendly interface for visually accessible users, nor more
robustness against bots [11].
2.3 Image-based CAPTCHA systems
Image-based CAPTCHA systems emerged in efforts to replace
text-based CAPTCHA systems which were growing more complex
for humans to solve easily. Security is not the only concern in a
good CAPTCHA design. All CAPTCHA systems are a form of
