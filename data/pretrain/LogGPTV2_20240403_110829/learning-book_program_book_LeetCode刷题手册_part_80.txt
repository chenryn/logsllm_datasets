832.FlippinganImage
题目
Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the
resulting image.
To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed. For example,fliping
[1, 1, o] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1]
To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For
example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0] .
Example 1:
Input: [[1,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,0,0]]
output: [[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[o,1,1], [1,0,1],[0,0,0]] .
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Example 2:

Input: [[1,1,0,0] , [1,0,0,1], [0,1,1,1], [1,0,1,0]]
output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[o,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1], [1,1,1,0],
[0,1,0,1]] .
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0], [0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]

841.KeysandRooms
题目
There are N rooms and you start in room 0. Each room has a distinct number in 0, 1, 2,
, N-1, and each room may have some keys to access the next room.
Formally, each room i has a list of keys rooms [i] , and each key rooms [i] [j] is an integer in
[0, 1, ..., N-1] where N = rooms.1ength. A key rooms[i][j] = v opens the room with
number v.
Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0 ).
You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.
Return true if and only if you can enter every room.
Example 1:
---
## Page 794
Input: [[1], [2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Exp1anation:
we start in room 0, and pick up key 1.
we then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.
we then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.
we then go to room 3. Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.
Example 2:
Input: [[1,3], [3,0,1], [2], [0]]
