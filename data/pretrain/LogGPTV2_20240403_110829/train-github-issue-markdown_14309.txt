Hi,
Love the framework. Using it for my company's developer website.
The Bootstrap documentation has this nice element for creating callouts, e.g.
"Alternate elements" in the Italics section of the CSS page.
It doesn't look like this is part of the framework. It's a very useful feature
and I would love to see it officially incorporated and expanded upon.
