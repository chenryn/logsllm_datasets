Subject: Feature Request: Incorporating Callouts in Our Framework

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently utilizing your framework for the development of my companyâ€™s developer website and have found it to be incredibly useful.

While reviewing the Bootstrap documentation, I came across a particularly handy feature: callouts. These are used, for example, in the "Alternate elements" section under the Italics part of the CSS page. They serve as an effective way to highlight important information or provide additional context within the documentation.

It appears that this feature is not yet included in our current framework. Given its usefulness, I would like to suggest officially incorporating and further enhancing this functionality. I believe it could greatly improve the clarity and user experience of our documentation.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to any updates or feedback you may have.

Best regards,
