12 -span columns is great for nearly all cases - except creating 5 column
layouts.
But I can't create a 10 column system without deleting the 12 column one. And
the reason is mainly because @grid-column -variable is called inside the
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/less/mixins/grid-framework.less
-mixins.
If @grid-column was passed to the mixin as the default value parameter then
creating both 12 and 10 (and whatever) column systems would be easy.
Like instead of this:
    .calc-grid-column(@index, @class, @type) when (@type = width) and (@index > 0) {
      .col-@{class}-@{index} {
        width: percentage((@index / @grid-columns));
      }
    }
It would be:
    .calc-grid-column(@index, @class, @type, @grid-column-count: @grid-columns) when (@type = width) and (@index > 0) {
      .col-@{class}-@{index} {
        width: percentage((@index / @grid-column-count));
      }
    }
I already got it to work (SASS version) and I think this would be a logical
addition.
