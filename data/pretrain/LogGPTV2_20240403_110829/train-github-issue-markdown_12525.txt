I'm trying to pass an `Input` component styled with styled-components into
select and getting the warning:  
`Material-UI: you have provided an invalid value to the `input`property., We
expect an element instance of the`Input` component.`

## Expected Behavior
I should be able to pass an Input styled with styled components to Select
    const StyledInput = styled(Input)
    } />
## Current Behavior
Throws warning:
    warning(
      isMuiElement(input, ['Input']),
      [
        'Material-UI: you have provided an invalid value to the `input` property.',
        'We expect an element instance of the `Input` component.',
      ].join('\n'),
    );
