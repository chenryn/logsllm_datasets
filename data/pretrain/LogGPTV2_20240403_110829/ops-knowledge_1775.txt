User: How to use Python for data analysis, give a specific example, and show the final analysis results.
Assistant: Using Python for data analysis can use some common libraries and tools, such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc. Below, taking the Pandas library as an example, a simple example of data analysis is given. First, we need to import the data into Python. Here we use a csv file containing sales records, which can be read in using the read_csv method of Pandas: ```python import pandas as pd sales_data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv') ``` After reading in the data, we You can use the head method to view the first few rows of data: ```python sales_data.head() ``` The result is as follows: | | Order ID | Product | Quantity Ordered | Price Each | Order Date | Purchase Address | |---:| ---------|----------------|------------------|---- --------|--------------------|-------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -----------| | 0 | 295665 | Macbook Pro... | 1 | 1700.0 | 2019-12-30 00:01:00 | 136 Church St, New York City, NY 10001 | | 1 | 295666 | LG Washing ... | 1 | 600.0 | 2019-12-29 07:03:00 | 562 2nd St, New York City, NY 10001 | | 2 | 295667 | USB-C Charg... | 1 | 11.95 | 2019-12-12 18:21:00 | 277 Main St, New York City, NY 10001 | | 3 | 295668 | Bose Sound... | 1 | 99.99 | 2019-12-22 15:13:00 | 410 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94016 | | 4 | 295669 | Vareebaddo ... | 1 | 400.0 | 2019-12-18 12:38:00 | 43 Hill St, Atlanta, GA 30301 | The data contains some key information of sales records, such as order number, product name, sales quantity, unit price, order date and purchase address, etc. Next, we use the groupby method of Pandas to group the data according to each attribute, and calculate the statistical information of each group: ```python sales_data.groupby('Product').agg({'Quantity Ordered': 'sum ', 'Price Each': 'mean'}) ``` The result is as follows: | Product | Quantity Ordered | Price Each | |---------------------- ---------|------------------|------------| | 20in Monitor | 4129 | 109.99 | 27in 4K Gaming Monitor | 6244 | 389.99 | | 27in FHD Monitor | 7550 | 149.99 | | 34in Ultrawide Monitor | 6199 | 379.99 | | AA Batteries (4-pack) | 27635 | 31017 | 3.54 | | Apple Airpods Headphones | 15661 | 150.0 | | Bose SoundSport Headphones | 13457 | 99.99 | | Flatscreen TV | 4819 | 300.0 | | Google Phone | 00.0 | | LG Washing Machine 666 | 600.0 | | Lightning Charging Cable | 23217 | 14.95 | | Macbook Pro Laptop | 4728 | 1700.0 | | ThinkPad Laptop | 8 | 400.0 | | Wired Headphones | 20557 | 11.99 | | iPhone | 6849 | 700.0 | As you can see, we have grouped by product name and calculated the number of sales and average price for each product. This information helps you understand which products are the most popular, which ones are more reasonably priced, and more. For example, it can be found that the sales volume of AA batteries far exceeds that of other products, which may reflect the wide demand and affordable price of AA batteries, and provide important market information for enterprises. Finally, we can use the Matplotlib library to draw charts to display the data more intuitively: ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.bar(sales_data.groupby('Product').sum().index, sales_data.groupby( 'Product').sum()['Quantity Ordered']) plt.xticks(rotation='vertical') plt.ylabel('Quantity Ordered') plt.xlabel('Product') plt.show() ``` This code plots the sales quantity of various products into a histogram: ![example](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20180424161423508?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQvenZveGluZzEyMzQ1Njc4OVo4/font/5a6L5L2T/fonts ize/400/ fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/q/75|watermark/2/text/aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2dpbi51bmliby5jb20vVmljdG9yeV9BbmRyb2lk/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70 /q/75) can see that due to AA Batteries are being sold in such large volumes that sales of other products are barely visible on the chart. Therefore, if you are comparing multiple products, you may need to use a different chart type or scale the data appropriately.
