### Discussion

We discuss the research questions formulated in Section IV and consider the economic and policy implications of our results.

**RQ1: Relative importance of the availability period and provisioning time.**
- The availability of security updates was the product attribute with the highest relative importance, up to twice as important as other high-ranked attributes, and had the widest span of average utility (Table III).
- Provisioning time for security updates was less important than their availability but more important than most technical features.
- Consumers prefer short provisioning times and assign a negative utility (i.e., dislike) to a 30-day provisioning time for products with high perceived security risk (Table IV).
- The high importance of the security update label attributes is surprising, as users are not familiar with these attributes. This might be due to the explicit mentioning of non-availability, which could have discouraged users.
- The negative utility of non-availability (-111.93 for home cameras and -77.52 for weather stations) is greater than the positive utility of availability (97.61 and 55.61, respectively), indicating that consumers want to avoid non-availability.

**RQ2: Differences between products with low and high perceived security risk.**
- For products with high perceived security risk, the importance of availability is at least twice as high as the importance of other attributes.
- For products with low perceived security risk, availability is only slightly more important than other high-ranked attributes.
- For the product with high perceived security risk, preference for a profile with a 6-year guarantee for security updates increased from 6.6% to 53.4%.
- For the product with low perceived security risk, the increase was smaller, from 9.5% to 32.7%.
- The security update label shows a relative importance of 45% for the product with high perceived security risk, compared to 36% for the product with low perceived security risk.
- This finding supports the concern of moral hazard: Users might consider security update labels primarily if they think they could be personally affected by security incidents. However, products with seemingly low perceived security risk can still be used for serious attacks, such as the Mirai botnet utilizing digital video recorders [7].
- Educational campaigns may be needed to explain non-personal security risks associated with IoT devices.

**RQ3: Differences due to demographic characteristics of the consumers.**
- For the product with high perceived security risk, no significant differences were found in demographic factors (Table VI).
- For the product with low perceived security risk, statistically significant differences were observed in age, vocational qualification, and income.
- Older and higher-income groups assigned higher importance to the security update label attributes (Table VII), suggesting they may invest more in sustainable security.
- Younger and lower-income groups seemed less concerned about security updates.
- Demographics play a minor role for products with high perceived security risk, while for products with low perceived security risk, younger and lower-income populations may prefer cheaper products with lower security.

**RQ4: Differences due to security behavior intentions, privacy concerns, and security risk perception of the consumers.**
- For the product category with high perceived security risk, only minor differences were observed between groups.
- For the product category with low perceived security risk, the importance of the security update label ranged from very low to very high.
- Respondents with higher security behavior intentions and privacy concerns exhibited a higher preference for the attributes of the security update label.
- Higher security risk perception positively related to the higher importance of the security update labelâ€™s attributes, indicating that consumers with higher sensitivity to security risks and privacy concerns assign higher importance to security update labels.

### Limitations and Future Work
- The study has the usual limitations of conjoint analysis, including the need to limit the number of product attributes and discretize attribute levels.
- Some product attributes, such as design, were discarded due to impracticality.
- Product profiles cannot fully represent all factors influencing buying decisions, such as presentation, packaging, and consumer ratings.
- Usability aspects of update mechanisms may also influence consumer choice.
- The evaluation of stated preferences (hypothetical buying decisions) may differ from real buying decisions.
- The study was conducted with German respondents, so the results may not be generalizable to other markets.
- Future work should investigate the impact of security update labels in other countries and with different sets of participants, products, and attributes.
- Future research should also consider the positions of manufacturers and policymakers.

### Economic Implications
- Security update guarantees may create additional costs for manufacturers, which could be passed on to consumers.
- Attributes with high importance for consumers' choices indicate a willingness to pay a higher price for products with those attributes.
- Studies show that consumers perceive price increases as fair if they are caused by higher costs for the manufacturer.
- Prior works suggest that consumers accept additional costs for security, depending on the product's perceived security risk.

### Policy Implications
- Mandatory security update labels could significantly influence consumer choices.
- These labels enable non-experts to compare security properties of different IoT products during the purchase process.
- The introduction of security update labels could increase the security of IoT consumer products by establishing economic incentives for manufacturers to guarantee long and timely availability of security updates.
- Unpatched IoT consumer products are a major reason behind current IoT security incidents, and these labels could strengthen overall IoT security.

### Conclusion
- Security update labels benefit consumers by decreasing the probability of becoming a victim to disclosed but unpatched vulnerabilities.
- They motivate manufacturers to invest more resources in providing security updates, potentially leading to positive changes in their business strategies.
- National security will also benefit from these labels, as they reduce the attack surface for malicious domestic and foreign actors.
