price (30%), followed by technical features, such as rain and
wind sensor (21%) and battery lifetime (13%). The availability
(8%) and provisioning time (7%) are the least
important
attributes, i.e., the security update label plays only a minor
role in the consumers’ choice of this segment.
VII. DISCUSSION
We discuss research questions formulated in Section IV, and
consider economic and policy implications of our results.
RQ1: Relative importance of the availability period and
provisioning time. The availability of security updates was the
product attribute with the highest relative importance (up to
twice as important as other high-ranked attributes) as well as
with the widest span of average utility (Table III). Provisioning
time for security updates was evaluated as less important than
their availability, but seems to be more important than most
technical features. Consumers also prefer short provisioning
times, and even assign a negative utility (i.e., dislike) to the
provisioning time of 30 days for the product with the high
perceived security risk (Table IV). The high importance of the
attributes of the security update label is surprising, as users
are not familiar with these attributes. This might be due to the
explicit mentioning of the non-availability of security updates
that might have discouraged the users. This effect can be seen
in Table IV where the negative utility of non-availability is
greater (-111.93 for home cameras and -77.52 for weather
stations) than the positive utility of availability of security
updates for 6 years (97.61 and 55.61, respectively). This
indicates that consumers want to avoid the non-availability of
security updates, and therefore, the mandatory nature of the
security update label is very important.
RQ2: Differences between products with a low and high
perceived security risk. We observed differences in the relative
importance of the security update attributes. For the product
with the high perceived security risk,
the importance of
availability is at least twice as high as the importance of other
attributes. In contrast, availability is only slightly more impor-
tant than for other high-ranked attributes for the product with a
low perceived security risk. Furthermore, for the product with
the high perceived security risk, the results of the holdout tasks
(cf. Table V, ‘Real’-columns) show an increase of preference
for product proﬁle P3a from 6.6% (without guaranteed security
update) to 53.4% for proﬁle P3b (with 6-year guarantee for
security updates). For the product with the low perceived
security risk, there is a comparatively smaller increase from
9.5% to 32.7% in the preference for the analogous product
proﬁles. Also, if we sum up the importance of both label
attributes, the security update label shows a relative importance
of 45% for the consumers’ choice regarding the product with
the high perceived security risk, compared to 36% for the

This ﬁnding supports the concern of moral hazard (Sec-
tion III-D): Users might consider security update labels pri-
marily if they think that they could be personally affected by
security incidents. In reality, however, products with seemingly
low perceived security risk for the owner can be used for
serious attacks. For example, Mirai utilized digital video
recorders [7]. We conclude that the introduction of security
update labels might need educational campaigns that explain
non-personal security risks associated with IoT devices.
RQ3: Differences due to demographic characteristics of the
consumers. The sample segmentation for the product with
high perceived security risk did not show any differences in
demographic factors (Table VI). For the product with low
perceived security risk, the segmentation showed statistically
signiﬁcant differences in terms of age, vocational qualiﬁcation,
and income. The groups with higher age and higher income
assigned a higher importance to the security update label
attributes (Table VII). This could indicate that this type of
consumers may invest more in sustainable security of their
IoT devices. In contrast, the group with the youngest age
and lowest income seems not to care much about security
updates. We conclude that for products with a high perceived
security risk, demographics may play a minor role, whereas
for the products with lower perceived security risk, younger
population with lower income may prefer cheaper products
with lower security.
product with the low perceived security risk.
RQ4: Differences due to security behavior intentions, pri-
vacy concerns, and security risk perception of the consumers.
While the segmentation of the product category with the high
perceived security risk showed only minor differences between
the groups, the groups for the product category with the low
perceived security risk range from very low to very high
importance of the security update label. There, the respondents
with higher security behavior intentions and privacy concerns
exhibit a higher preference for the attributes of the security
update label. For both product categories, a higher security risk
perception positively relates to the higher importance of the
security update label’s attributes. This indicates that consumers
with a higher sensitivity for security risks and privacy concerns
may assign a higher importance to the security update labels.
Limitations and Future Work: The results of the user study
have the usual limitations of conjoint analysis studies. For the
comparison of products, we had to limit the number of product
attributes and discretize attribute levels. Also, some product
attributes, such as product design, were discarded due to im-
practicality of the speciﬁcation of attribute levels. Although we
speciﬁed product attributes and attribute levels based on best
practices and empirical evidence, a product proﬁle cannot fully
represent all factors that may inﬂuence buying decisions, such
as product presentation, packaging, advertisement campaigns,
and consumer ratings. Usability aspects of update mechanisms
might also inﬂuence the consumers’ choice. Another limitation
might be due to the evaluation of stated preferences (i.e.,
hypothetical buying decisions). However, the assessment of
real buying decisions was infeasible as there are no suitable
products that guarantee security updates. Finally, as we ran
the user study with German respondents, the results might
not be valid for other markets. Thus, future work is required
to investigate the impact of security update labels in other
countries, and with different sets of participants, products,
and attributes. As we focused on the consumers’ choice in
this work, future work should also consider the positions of
manufacturers and policy makers.
Economic Implications: Security update guarantees may
create additional costs for the manufacturers that will be poten-
tially passed on to the consumers [29]. Are consumers willing
to bear these costs? CBC analyses are not appropriate to
precisely estimate consumers’ willingness to pay for a certain
attribute. However, attribute levels with a high importance for
consumers’ choices also indicate a willingness to pay a higher
price for products with this attribute level [90]. In addition,
initial support for the willingness to pay a price premium
is provided by studies that show that consumers perceive
price increases as fair if they are caused by higher costs
for a manufacturer [102]–[104]. Prior works [6], [105] also
concluded that consumers accept additional costs for security
depending on the product’s perceived security risk.
Policy Implications: Our results show that mandatory se-
curity update labels could indeed have a high inﬂuence on
the consumers’ choices. The labels communicate attributes
that enable non-experts to compare security properties of
different IoT products intuitively during the purchase process,
and thereby inﬂuence buying decisions. The introduction of
security update labels might increase security of IoT con-
sumer products through establishing economic incentives for
manufacturers to guarantee a long and timely availability
of security updates, or, from another perspective, creating
competitive disadvantages for the non-availability of security
updates. These labels could strengthen the state of IoT security
in the long term, as unpatched IoT consumer products are a
major reason behind today’s IoT security incidents.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Security update labels beneﬁt consumers, as they decrease
the probability of becoming a victim to disclosed but un-
patched vulnerabilities. They have the potential to motivate
manufacturers to invest more resources in the provision of
security updates, which might lead to positive security-related
changes in their business strategies. Finally, national security
will also proﬁt from these labels, as they strengthen the
security of the private IoT infrastructure, and therefore, reduce
the attack surface for malicious domestic and foreign actors.
