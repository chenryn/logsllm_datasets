User: Will i have any advantage of using Node.js for task queue worker instead of any other language, like PHP/Python/Ruby?
I want to learn Redis for simple task queue tasks like sending big ammounts of email and do not want keeping users to wait for establishing connection etc.
So the questions is: does async nature of node.js help in this scenario or is it useless?
P.S. i know that node is faster than any of this language in memory consumption and computation because of effecient V8 engine, maybe it's possible to win on this field?
Assistant: I have used Node.js for task worker for jobs that call runnable webpages written in PHP or running commands on certain hosts. In both these instances Node is just initializing (triggering) the job, waiting for and then evaluating the result. The heavy lifting / CPU intensive work is done by another system / program.
Hope this helps!
