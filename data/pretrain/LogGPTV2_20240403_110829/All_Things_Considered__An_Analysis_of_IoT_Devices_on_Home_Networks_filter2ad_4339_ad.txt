Table 9: Weak Default Credentials by Region and Device Type—We show the weak FTP and Telnet device population by
region and device type, highlighting both the fraction of devices that support (Sup) each protocol as well as the fraction that are
vulnerable with weak default credentials (Vuln). Some regions have a higher fraction of devices with weak credentials—in the
largest case, 50% of FTP devices in Southeast Asia and 4.9% of all Telnet devices in Central Asia are weak. We further observe
that the likelihood of having weak FTP credentials is correlated to weak Telnet credentials, indicating that the presence of weak
credentials may be linked to weaker security posture in the region overall.
Of those, 17.4% exhibit weak FTP passwords and 2.1% have
weak Telnet passwords. In both cases, admin/admin is most
common and accounts for 88% of weak FTP and 36% of
weak Telnet credentials (Table 8). The credential is used by
FTP devices from 571 vendors and from 160 Telnet vendors.
Regions vary in terms of vulnerable IoT device populations.
In the smallest case, 14.7% of FTP devices in Western Europe
support weak default credentials while more than 55% of
FTP devices in Sub-Saharan Africa that are weak. A similar,
though not as drastic range exists for Telnet. North Amer-
ica has the smallest vulnerable population of Telnet devices
(0.5%), Central Asia and South America share the largest
vulnerable Telnet population (4.9% of all IoT Telnet devices),
primarily because of their reliance on surveillance devices,
which have the weakest Telnet proﬁle of all IoT devices.
Nearly all of the IoT devices that support FTP are work
appliances (76%), storage (9.1%), media (7.6%), and surveil-
lance devices (5.1%). Media and surveillance devices appear
in the list due to their global popularity—unlike storage and
work appliances where 29% and 23% of devices support FTP
respectively, only 1% of media devices and 4% of surveil-
lance devices support FTP. This aligns with the business need
for work and storage devices to facilitate user ﬁle transfer,
and also explains why there is little variance in the types of
devices that support FTP across regions.
Storage devices are the device type most likely to support
FTP, though only a small fraction of them use weak creden-
tials. There are two regional exceptions—East Asia and Sub-
Saharan Africa (Table 9), which exhibit 12.2% and 10.1%
of storage devices with weak credentials respectively. We
observe this is primarily due to one vendor, ICP Electronics,
which has a large market presence in the two regions: 12.1%
and 10.1% of storage devices in East Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa respectively. 74% of ICP storage devices exhibit weak
default credentials.
A surprising number of home routers also support FTP
(10.2%). TP-Link is responsible for the most routers with
weak FTP credentials (Table 10)—regions that rely on TP-
Link routers thus have a higher rate of devices with weak
FTP credentials. Of all TP-Link devices across all regions,
9.3% offer an open FTP port, and 62.8% of those devices are
protected by weak credentials.
Unlike FTP, there is little reason for any IoT devices to
support Telnet in 2019. Yet, we ﬁnd both that surveillance
devices and routers consistently support the protocol. Surveil-
lance devices have the weakest Telnet proﬁle, with 10.7%
of surveillance devices that support Telnet exhibiting weak
credentials. This aligns with anecdotal evidence that suggests
that these kinds of devices are easy to hack [4].
4.2 Home Routers
Nearly every home in our dataset has a home router. Similar
to most types of IoT devices, there are regional differences
and a long tail of vendors globally (Table 9).
In total,
we see home routers from 4.8 K vendors. TP-Link is
the most popular manufacturer globally (15% of routers)
and is the top provider in ﬁve regions: South America,
Central Asia, Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Southeast
Asia. Arris is the most popular router vendor in North
America (16.4%)—likely because popular ISPs like Comcast
supply Arris routers to customers. Huawei is the most
popular vendor in Sub-Saharan and North Africa, accounting
for 19.8% and 25.6% of all routers respectively.

Table 10: Weak Vendors by Device Type—We show the vendors that exhibit weak default credentials across each device type
in our dataset sorted by the fraction of weak devices they contribute to their respective device types. For example, 71.2% of
Ricoh printers that support FTP also support weak default credentials, and these make up 29.8% of all weak work appliances.
Weak FTP/Telnet Credentials More than 93% of routers
have HTTP administration interfaces on port 80. We also ﬁnd
that many routers support DNS over UDP (66.5%), UPnP
(63.4%), DNS over TCP (42.1%), HTTPS (42.2%), SSH
(19.7%), FTP (10.8%), and Telnet (14.6%). Of the devices
that support FTP and/or Telnet, 12% have weak FTP and 1.6%
have weak Telnet credentials. 1.2% of all routers exhibit a
weak FTP credential and 0.2% exhibit of all routers have a
weak Telnet credential. For FTP, TP-Link routers had the
weakest proﬁle: 55.3% of their routers with an open FTP port
exhibited a weak credential. For Telnet, D-Link routers were
the weakest—6% of all open routers had a weak credential,
and 35.3% of all D-Link routers had an open Telnet port. We
show a breakdown by region in Table 10.
Weak HTTP Administration Credentials WiFi Inspec-
tor attempts to login to the HTTP interfaces for devices from
a small number of common vendors, including TP-Link—
the most common router manufacturer. In our dataset, there
are 3.8 M TP-Link home routers, of which 82% have an
HTTP port open to the local network. WiFi Inspector was
able to check for weak default credentials on 2.5 M (66%)
of the devices with HTTP. Overall, 1.2 M (30%) of TP-Link
routers exhibit weak HTTP credentials. Nearly all (99.6%)
use admin/admin. The number of TP-Link routers with
guessable passwords varies greatly across regions (Table 9).
For example, only 6% of TP-Link routers in North America
have weak passwords while around 45% do in South and
Central Asia, and East and South Europe.
External Exposure
To understand whether routers with
weak default credentials are also exposed on the public Inter-
net, we joined the WiFi Inspector dataset with Internet-wide
scan data from Censys [16] for devices on a single day—
January 30, 2019.7 A small number of home routers host
publicly accessible services: 3.4% expose HTTP, 0.8% FTP,
0.7% Telnet, and 0.8% SSH. Open gateways are primarily
located in three regions—Central America (29.3%), Eastern
Europe (20.6%), and Southeast Asia (17.2%). Of routers
that are externally exposed, we ﬁnd that 51.2% of them are

exposed with a vulnerability—far higher than the fraction non-
externally available routers in our dataset with a weakness
or vulnerability (25.8%). The most popular router vendor in
these regions is TP-Link, which is also the vendor responsible
for the most externally exposed routers (19.7%). We note
this is not simply because TP-Link is the largest vendor—a
proportion test across regions shows that TP-Link routers
appear in the set of externally exposed routers at a higher rate
than that of non-externally exposed routers.
4.3 Scanning Homes
While scan data can provide insight into the vulnerability
of hosts, it typically does not indicate whether hosts have
been compromised. We analyzed the homes from WiFi In-
spector that were seen performing vulnerability scans in a
large network telescope (Section 2) on January 1, 2019 to
better understand infected devices. Of the 500.7 K homes that
WiFi Inspector collected data from that day, 1,865 (0.37%)
homes were found to be scanning for vulnerabilities. Scans
most frequently target TCP/445 (SMB, 26.7% homes) fol-
lowed by TCP/23 (Telnet, 11.3%), TCP/80 (HTTP, 10.7%),
and TCP/8080 (HTTP, 9.4%). In addition to checking cre-
dentials, WiFi Inspector also checks devices for a handful
of recent, known vulnerabilities (CVEs, EDBs, and oth-
ers). 1,156 (62%) of scanning homes contained at least one
known vulnerability—conversely, 7.2 M (46.8%) non scan-
ning homes in our dataset contain at least one known vulnera-
bility. To test the differences between these populations, we
used a proportions t-test at a conﬁdence interval of 95%. We
observe that the two sets are statistically signiﬁcantly different
(p-value: 2.31∗ 10−39), indicating that scanning homes have
a higher vulnerability proﬁle than homes globally. This trend
also holds for the number of vulnerable devices in scanning
homes (9.7%) compared to homes globally (5.7%). Unfor-
tunately, we were unable to determine why homes without
known vulnerabilities were seen scanning. This is likely due
to devices being compromised through means outside of our
measurement vantage point, for example, vulnerabilities that
we do not test for.
Although the overall vulnerability proﬁle of devices in
scanning homes is higher, this is not true of all speciﬁc vul-

nerabilities. Of the 25 vulnerabilities observed in scanning
homes, 17 appeared at a ratio that was not statistically signiﬁ-
cantly different than devices globally. The remaining eight
vulnerabilities were statistically signiﬁcantly different, though
six appear at a smaller rate in scanning homes than globally.
The two vulnerabilities that appeared at a higher rate in scan-
ning homes were both related to EternalBlue—a leaked NSA
exploit targeting SMB on Windows that was primarily respon-
sible for the WannaCry outbreak that impacted millions of
Windows devices in 2017 [44]. Speciﬁcally, we identify 5.2%
of devices within scanning homes that are vulnerable to Eter-
nalBlue, and further, 1.3% of devices in scanning homes are
already compromised, and communicating through a back-
door. This additionally explains some fraction of the SMB
scanning we observed on the darknet, as machines compro-
mised via EternalBlue often scan for other hosts running
vulnerable SMB servers. We note that although these homes
contain vulnerable devices, we cannot claim that they are
scanning as a result of these devices—for one, we do not
have full vulnerability coverage, and two, it is an outstanding
challenge to attribute device behavior from our vantage point.
Still, the presence of any scanning homes in general indi-
cates a threat landscape larger than simply publicly accessible
devices, and one that should be considered by the security
community.
5 Discussion
Recent security research has focused on new home IoT de-
vices, such as smart locks and home automation. Our results
suggest that while these devices are growing in importance
in western regions, they are far from the most common IoT
devices around the world. Instead, home IoT is better char-
acterized by smart TVs, printers, game consoles, and surveil-
lance devices—devices that have been connected to our home
networks for more than a decade. Furthermore, these are the
kinds of devices that still support weak credentials for old pro-
tocols: work appliances are the device type with the highest
fraction of weak FTP credentials; surveillance devices are the
worst for telnet credentials. Improving the security posture
of these devices remains just as important as ensuring that
new technologies are secure—our home networks are only as
secure as their weakest link.
There are some immediate next steps. As outlined in Sec-
tion 4, much of the devices that support weak credentials
are manufactured by a handful of popular vendors across all
regions (Table 10). The security community can start address-
ing these challenges by encouraging the largest offending
vendors to adopt better security practices. On the policy end,
law enforcement and legal entities have started to provide
legal disincentives for weak security practices. In light of
the Mirai attacks, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has
prompted legal action against D-Link [12] for putting U.S.
consumers at risk.
A larger question remains on how to address the long tail of
vendors. As described in Section 3, regions often have vastly
different preferences for vendors across device types. As a
result, working to improve the security of devices based solely
on the global distribution may inadvertently leave smaller
regions with divergent preferences less secure.
Finally, it is not immediately clear how to measure the
impact of compromise on home security. In our work, we
measured the prevalence of scanning, though this is just one
indication of compromise. Furthermore, we only observed
0.37% of homes scanning; amounting to only 1.8 K homes
on a single day.
In spite of all the data collected within
homes in this paper, we could not effectively identify why
certain homes were compromised. Researchers have proposed
systems to enable auditing of home IoT setups [55, 58], but
there is still more work to be done.
6 Related Work
Our work build on research from a number of areas, primarily
in home network measurement and IoT security.
Home Network Measurement
Early research in home
network measurement primarily focused on debugging
networks—projects like Netalyzer [35] were conceived to en-
able users to debug their home Internet connectivity [9,15,49].
A number of follow on papers leveraged Netalyzer-like scans
to investigate the state of devices in homes [1, 9, 14], as well
to try and understand the implications of a connected home
on user behavior [10].
Most similar to our work is presented by Grover et al. who
installed home routers with custom ﬁrmware in 100 homes
across 21 countries to measure the availability, infrastructure,
and usage of home networks [26, 53]. Their work focuses
on the network properties of home networks on aggregate,
and also is able to measure networks continuously based on
their position in the network. Our work instead focuses on the
devices behind the NAT in their ubiquity and their security
properties, with particular attention spent on IoT devices.
Recent work has built off of network scanning to enable
rich device identiﬁcation. Feng et al. built a system that lever-
ages application layer responses to perform device identiﬁ-
cation without machine learning, similar to our hand curated
expert rules [21]. This work has built off a number of papers
that leverage banners and other host information to charac-
terize hosts [6, 20, 39, 50, 51]. Other rule based engines have
been used in other work on active, public scan data based on
probing for application banners [4, 16].
Home IoT Security Home IoT security has been of recent
interest to researchers in light of its growing security and
privacy implications, from the systems level up through the
application layer. Ma et al. investigated the rise of the Mi-
rai botnet [4], which was largely composed of IoT devices
compromised due to weak credentials and used to launch

massive DDoS attacks. This is not isolated to only attackers—
researchers have been breaking the home IoT devices since
their conception [8, 31, 38, 47, 59]. Notably, Fernandes et al.
outlined a number of challenges in Samsung SmartThings
devices, from their access control policy to their third-party
developer integration [22]. In response, researchers have built
systems to enable security properties in home IoT, such as
information ﬂow tracking and sandboxing [23,33], improving
device authentication [54], and enabling auditing informa-
tion [55, 58]. Most recently, Alrawi et al. synthesized the
security of home IoT devices into a SoK, where they present
a systematization of attacks and defense on home IoT and
outline how to reason about home IoT risk [2].
Internet-Wide IoT Scanning
There has been a wealth of
recent work that has used Internet-wide scanning for security
analysis, including analyzing embedded systems on the public
Internet (e.g., [4, 7, 18, 24, 28, 30, 36, 37, 40, 48, 52, 60]). In
contrast to these works, we focus on devices inside of homes
that are not visible through Internet-wide scanning.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted the ﬁrst large-scale empirical anal-
ysis of IoT devices on real-world home networks. Leveraging
internal network scans of 83M IoT devices in 16M homes
worldwide, we ﬁnd that IoT devices are widespread. In sev-
eral regions, the majority of homes now have at least one
networked IoT device. We analyzed the types and vendors
of commonly purchased devices and provided a landscape
of the global IoT ecosystem. We further analyzed the secu-
rity proﬁle of these devices and networks and showed that a
signiﬁcant fraction of devices use weak passwords on FTP
and Telnet, are vulnerable to known attacks, and use default
HTTP administration passwords that are left unchanged by
users. We hope our analysis will help the security community
develop solutions that are applicable to IoT devices already
in today’s homes.
