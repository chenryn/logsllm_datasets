[中文版本(Chinese version)](README.zh-cn.md)
Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
On Windows, if an application developed by Electron registers a Protocol Handler (allowing the user to call the application in the browser), a parameter injection vulnerability may occur and eventually cause remote code vulnerability on the user side.
