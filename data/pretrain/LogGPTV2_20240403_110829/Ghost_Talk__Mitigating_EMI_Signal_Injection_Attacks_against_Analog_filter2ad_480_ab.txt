have the form v(t) = m(t) cos(2πfct). On the receiving
side, a vulnerable sensor can behave as an AM receiver and
downconvert v(t), recovering only the baseband signal m(t).
As a result, the output of the sensor is s(cid:48)(t) = s(t) + m(t).
The key to mounting a successful modulated attack is to
ﬁnd a frequency that can induce a large enough voltage v(t),
and simultaneously be demodulated by another component
to recover m(t) from v(t).
1) Conducting paths as antennas: To exploit the “back-
door” coupling [1] effect, the frequency of the emitted EMI
signal carrier has to be at the resonant frequency of the re-
ceiving circuit component in order to maximize the received
voltage levels. An approximation to determine the resonant
frequency of a whip antenna in far-ﬁeld communication
is its length, which is approximately one quarter of the
wavelength of the resonant frequency. This rule may not
be applicable to a wire connecting two electric components
inside a sensor because the impedance of the connected
components is unknown. Thus, the best way to determine
the resonant frequency of a sensor and therefore the carrier
frequency of EMI signals is to obtain a copy of the device
and sweep through a range of frequencies. We call this
method reverse-tuning and provide details in section IV.
2) Nonlinear components as demodulators: In commu-
nications, the harmonics and cross-products† produced by
the nonlinearity of electric components are typically con-
sidered undesirable distortions. An adversary can exploit
those distortions to achieve downconversion and to obtain
the baseband waveform. Ideally the components should be
linear devices such as ampliﬁers that amplify an input signal
vin(t) by a gain A. Thus, the output can be described as
vout(t) = Avin(t). In practice, ampliﬁers contain nonlinear
components, and the simplest output of a nonlinear ampliﬁer
can contain a quadratic term:
vout(t) = Avin(t) + Bv2
in(t),
(1)
in. With a crafted
where B is the gain for the quadratic term v2
input signal, such a nonlinear ampliﬁer can downconvert
the signal and recover the baseband signal. For instance,
an attacker with the goal of injecting m(t) can induce the
following voltage signal as the input to the ampliﬁer,
vin(t) = m(t) cos(2πfct) + cos(2πfct).
(2)
Without loss of generality, let m(t) be a simple tone, i.e.,
m(t) = cos(2πfmt). After applying Eq. (2) to Eq. (1)
†Harmonics are frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental
frequency components, and cross-products are multiplicative or conjunctive
combinations of harmonics and fundamental frequency components.
Figure 5. Example where the low-frequency signal m(t) is a 1kHz sine
wave modulated on a high frequency (fc = 826M Hz) carrier. The injected
signal appears on the conductor between the microphone and the ampliﬁer.
The nonlinear component (e.g. the ampliﬁer) introduces several frequency
components in the baseband and high frequency bands. After the low-pass
ﬁlter, only m(t) will be left and will be perceived as a real signal.
and taking the Fourier transform, we can conﬁrm that the
output of the ampliﬁer contains the intended frequency
component fm together with the ampliﬁed fundamental
frequency components of vin (i.e., fc − fm, fc + fm, and
fc), harmonics, and other cross products (i.e., fm, 2(fc −
fm), 2(fc + fm), 2fc, 2fc + fm, and 2fc − fm), as shown
in Figure 5. After a low-pass ﬁlter, all high-frequency com-
ponents will be removed and the fm frequency component
will remain, which completes the downconversion.
3) Analog to digital converters as demodulators: During
the digitization process, an ADC with a given sampling
frequency is used. By matching the emitted EMI carrier
frequency to the sampling frequency of the ADC an at-
tacker can turn it into a demodulator. Speciﬁcally, to yield
a digitized and discrete sequence v[k], an ADC samples
a continuous analog signal v(t) every Ts seconds,
i.e.,
v[k] = v(t)|t=kTs , k ∈ [1..∞]. Let V (f ) be the Fourier
transform of the original analog signal, and let Vs(f ) be the
sampled signal. Then,
Vs(f ) = fs
V (f − nfs),
∞(cid:88)
n=−∞
where fs is the sampling frequency. Essentially, the sampling
process creates a duplicated spectrum of the original signal
by shifting to f − nfs for n = [−∞..1, 0, .. + ∞]. An
adversary can select the carrier fc to be a multiple of the
sampling frequency fs, e.g., fc = 9fs. Thus, during the
digitization process, the ADC will sample the carrier at
intervals that skip the high-frequency oscillation, thus acting
as an envelope detector and recovering the original m(t).
4) Capacitor and diode as demodulators: The envelope
of the attacking signal in Eq. (2) is given by
e(t) = |m(t) + 1|.
If m(t) + 1 (cid:62) 0,∀t, then the modulated EMI signal v(t)
can be demodulated by passing through a simple envelope

happen to be a basic building blocks in many circuits.
In at least one of the devices we used (the MTS300CB
board for MicaZ motes) we discovered that there are several
capacitor combinations on the path between the microphone
and the ampliﬁer. While a diode was not present in that
particular circuit, the ampliﬁer forces the current to ﬂow in
one direction through the circuit, thus having the circuit itself
behave as a diode and making that circuit a good candidate
for extracting the baseband signal m(t).
F. Distance bounds
An important factor is the relationship between the fea-
sible attack distance and the strength of an injected electric
signal. In a receiving circuit with resistance Rr, in order to
induce an electric signal with V volts, the received power
(denoted by Pr) of an EMI signal is
Pr = V 2
Rr
.
(3)
Assuming that modulated EMI signals typically operate
in the MHz–GHz frequency band and that adversaries are at
least 0.5 meters away, we formulate the signal propagation
as far-ﬁeld communication. Although an accurate radio
propagation model should account for multipath, shadowing,
and fading, we utilize the free space propagation model to
understand the basics of feasible attack distances. Consider
an attacker at a distance d from the victim’s circuit who
transmits at a power level of Pt. Then the received power,
Pr, is calculated from the Friis transmission equation.
Pr = PtGtGr( λ
4πd )2,
(4)
where Gt and Gr are the antenna gains of the transmitting
and receiving antennas respectively, and λ is the wavelength
of the signal.
For example, consider an adversary who transmits at
100 mW with a 10 dB antenna. Suppose that the victim’s
device responds well to an 826 MHz carrier with a receiving
circuit of resistance 1.5 kΩ and an extremely low gain of
0.01 dB since it was not designed to receive radio signals.
To induce 10 mV on the victim’s sensing circuit during an
attack, from eq. (4) and eq. (3) the distance between the
attacker’s antenna and the victim’s system can be at most
11.2 m; this makes the attack practical. Using an antenna
with a higher gain of 20 dB and a signal source output of
1 W could increase the attack distance to over 50 m.
III. BASEBAND ATTACK METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS
Safety-critical systems such as medical devices commonly
have low-pass ﬁlters that attenuate high-frequency signals
where the resonant frequency ranges reside. An attacker
can still send low frequency signals within the passband
of the ﬁlters and compensate for the frequency mismatch
with higher-power signals (around 1 W or more) or reduced
distance.

(Top). Print-out of the electrocardiogram of the patient simulator conﬁgured
to exhibit ventricular ﬁbrillation (Bottom). The induced signal is visible on
lead 5 in the middle right. The ECG erroneously reported a 66 bpm pulse.
A. External ECG
An electrocardiogram (ECG) device is designed to moni-
tor cardiac activity (around 1 mV) by taking voltage readings
at the skin surface. ECGs connect to patients with conductive
pads and leads.
1) Experimental setup: To investigate the effects of EMI
on the system, we plugged an ECG to a patient simulator
(Bio-Tek Lionheart) conﬁgured to exhibit symptoms of ven-
tricular ﬁbrillation. We used an arbitrary function generator
(AFG) connected with a simple whip monopole antenna to
radiate low-power EMI signals. To compensate for the low
transmission power and the inefﬁcient radiator, we left two
of the leads disconnected and placed them within 5 cm of
the radiating antenna. Finally, we read the ECG screens to
determine whether the EMI injection was successful.
2) Antenna and vulnerable frequency range: When send-
ing high-frequency signals above 1 MHz, no signals were
observed at the ECG, although an induced voltage of over
10 mVp–p was measured at the leads. The results showed
that the pads and leads can serve as the entry point for
EMI to alter the sensor readings, but the high frequency
attenuation would make modulated EMI attacks difﬁcult.
3) Baseband EMI attacks: We transmitted a baseband
signal that emulated a cardiac rhythm (heart beats) at 66bpm,
as shown in Figure 6 (Top). After a stabilization period of
60–120 seconds, we observed that on the right side of the
printout sheet in Figure 6, the peaks of the injected baseband
signals are visible, indicating that our EMI signal affected
the sensor readings.
B. Cardiac implantable electrical devices (CIEDs)
CIEDs are used to treat cardiac diseases with electrical
stimulation. Under most conﬁgurations, pacemakers and
deﬁbrillators will send low-energy electrical stimulations
(around 10 µJ) to pace the cardiac tissue if no cardiac activity

is detected. Additionally deﬁbrillators can be conﬁgured
to detect potentially dangerous rhythms such as ﬁbrillation
or tachycardia, and deliver a shock (around 25 J) [25] to
reset all the electrical cardiac signals so that normal cardiac
activity may resume.
1) EMI coupling on leads: Leads threaded through blood
vessels and into the cardiac chambers connect a CIED
to the cardiac tissue. With the standard lead design, it is
possible to induce a voltage when exposed to EMI [20]. Due
to ﬂexibility requirements, instead of true coaxial designs,
leads use wound coaxial designs with the outside conductor
(i.e. the anode) tightly wound around the central insulated
conductor (i.e. the cathode). On the lead end that connects to
cardiac tissues, the central wire protrudes at what is called
the cathode tip. That tip is about 2.4 cm longer than the
external conductor that stops at what is called the anode ring
(Figure 7). On the lead end that connects to the CIED, the
anode is 1 cm longer than the cathode. This design combined
with the difference in length between the anode and cathode
conductors allow a voltage to be induced by EMI. When
radiating a 32 MHz signal at 300 mW from 14 m away, we
observed induced voltages of around 100 mV between the
anode and the cathode of a bipolar lead. Signals under
1 MHz induced lower voltages.
2) Vulnerable frequency range: CIEDs are designed to
amplify speciﬁc regions such as the 0.1 Hz–1 kHz range [23]
that contain electrogram information. To study their fre-
quency response, we ﬁrst disassembled an implantable pace-
maker and measured the output of the ﬁrst ﬁlter that is
connected to the lead. The measurements show that signals
below 5 MHz are only attenuated by 4dB, and signals
beyond 200 MHz and 800 MHz are attenuated by 30 dB
and 40 dB respectively, making high-frequency signals a
poor choice for an attacker. To obtain the system wide fre-
quency response, we ran a sweep in the low-frequency range
between 0.1 Hz and 1 kHz and observed the resulting relative
signal amplitude reported on the programmer connected to
the device. Signals in the 100 Hz–300 Hz range from our
ampliﬁer showed the strongest amplitudes.
3) Baseband attack experimental setup: We performed
the experiments under different conditions including:
• Free air, providing conditions to ﬁnd good candidate
waveforms for injected signals that would have a mea-
surable impact on the system;
150
• Saline bath with a 1.8g/L NaCl concentration, built
following the ANSI/AAMI PC69 speciﬁcations for
electromagnetic compatibility testing of cardiac de-
vices [17]; and
• Synthetic human with a functioning circulatory system
(using saline solution) and partial model of the human
heart [26]. Resistance measurements of the synthetic
human’s tissue showed that it is an approximate match
with human tissue.
In our experiments we used 3 deﬁbrillators (Medtronic
InSync Sentry - 2005, Boston Scientiﬁc Cognis 100-D -
unknown year, St. Jude Promote - 2007) and one pacemaker
(Medtronic Adapta - 2006). For each CIED tested, we
attached the same set of bipolar sensing and pacing leads
(Pacetronix Model No. 3851 VB) in the Left Ventricle
(“LV”) port. Preliminary results with a different set of leads
(Guidant Dextrus 4137) showed comparable results. For the
attacking waveform frequency in the 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz range,
we used an audio ampliﬁer connected to a wire used as a
simple whip antenna. The ampliﬁer’s estimated output was
10 W, corresponding to 50 volts over a 250 Ω load at the out-
put. The effective radiated power was much lower because of
the mismatched antenna. Nevertheless, our radiating system
was sufﬁcient to produce noticeable induced signals.
Our goal was to create pacing inhibition (atrial or ven-
tricular) and deﬁbrillation shocks. To determine success, we
used the electrogram readings displayed by a programmer
compatible with the device under test. To inhibit pacing, we
injected a 100 Hz sinusoid signal, a pulsed sinusoid with
a 100 ms width at 1 pulse per second, and a waveform
from the ANSI/AAMI EC13 set amplitude-modulated over
100 Hz. To induce ﬁbrillation events, we used the waveform
number 421 from the MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Ec-
topy Database, an electrogram recording of a real episode
of ventricular ﬁbrillation.
4) Results: The results are summarized in Table I. Pacing
inhibition in free air can be accomplished from the furthest
distance (1.5 m), and pacing inhibition in saline solution
were the most difﬁcult condition to produce (5 cm or under).
In free air, we did 20 trials for all devices except for the St.
Jude device where only 8 trials were recorded. The synthetic
human measurements only had 2 trials.
Pacing inhibition. In the free air tests, the pulsed and
modulated sinusoid signals at 30 V p–p effectively stopped
pacing on all tested devices from 0.68 m to 1.57 m. A sample
output from the Medtronic programmer is shown in Figure 8
(Top) showing a purple Ventricular Sense (VS) marker after
the onset of our EMI signal.
