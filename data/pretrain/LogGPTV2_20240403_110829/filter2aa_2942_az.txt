SAMPLE SCENARIOS 
This appendix provides six example threat scenarios specific to the U.S. Government using a 
fictitious ‘ABC Company’ and the Risk Exposure Framework described above. The examples 
purposely vary in their level of specificity and detail to show that threat scenarios can be as 
broad or specific – as detailed or generic – as necessary. While these scenarios use percentages 
and basic scoring measures (i.e., High, Moderate, Low) for likelihood, impact, and risk, 
enterprises may use any number of different units of measure (e.g., CVSS score). Additionally, 
these scenarios vary slightly in their implementation of the risk response framework to show that 
the Risk Exposure Framework can be adapted as needed. 
SCENARIO 1: Influence or Control by Foreign Governments Over Suppliers40 
Background  
An enterprise has decided to perform a threat scenario analysis of its printed circuit board (PCB) 
suppliers. The scenario will focus on the sensitivity of the business to unforeseen fluctuations in 
component costs. 
Threat Source 
ABC Company designs, assembles, and ships 3.5 million personal computers per year. It has a 
global footprint both in terms of customer and supply bases. Five years ago, in an effort to 
reduce the cost of goods sold, ABC Company shifted a majority of its PCB procurement to 
Southeast Asia. To avoid being single-sourced, ABC Company finalized agreements with five 
different suppliers within the country and has enjoyed a positive partnership with each during 
this time. 
Vulnerability 
Though sourcing from multiple vendors, ABC Company relies on suppliers in a single country 
(i.e., Southeast Asia). This exposes ABC Company to geopolitical threats due to the potential for 
policies of a single government to have a dramatic impact on the availability of supplied inputs.   
Threat Event Description 
The enterprise has established the following fictitious threat for the analysis exercise: Last year, 
new leadership took over the government of the country where ABC Company does most of 
their PCB business. This leadership has been focused on improving the financial and business 
environment within the country, allowing larger firms who set up headquarters and other major 
centers within the country advantages to do business more easily and cost-efficiently with 
suppliers within the same region. However, in February of 2019, the now-corrupt regime passed

NIST SP 800-161.

new legislation that established an additional 20 % tax on all electronic components and goods 
sold outside of the country. This new law was to take effect on June 1, 2019. 
When the new law was announced, ABC Company’s current inventory of PCBs was about 10 % 
of yearly demand, which was the typical inventory level with which they were comfortable. 
Before June, ABC Company reached out to all five suppliers to order additional materials, but 
there was quickly a shortage due to higher demand from many foreign customers of these 
products. By June 1, the day that the new tax law took effect, ABC Company had reached an 
inventory level of up to 15 % of yearly demand. 
Outcome 
Between February and June of 2019, ABC Company considered partnerships with new suppliers, 
but there were several issues identified. One in every 10 new suppliers that ABC Company 
contacted required a lead time for ramping up to the desired demand of anywhere from 6 months 
to 18 months. This would have necessitated additional work on ABC Company’s part, including 
testing samples of the supplier PCBs, finalizing logistical details, and monitoring supplier-side 
activities, such as the procurement of raw materials and the acquisition of additional personnel 
and production space that were necessary to meet the new demand. 
The second issue was that the current contracts with all five suppliers in Southeast Asia involved 
meeting minimum demand requirements, meaning that ABC Company was committed to 
purchasing a minimum of 100,000 PCBs per month for the duration of the contracts, which 
ranged anywhere from 3 months to 24 months in length. This would mean that ABC Company 
could not easily avoid the cost implications of the new tax. Could ABC Company absorb the cost 
of the PCBs? With a 20 % cost increase, this eroded the margins of a PC from 13.5 % down to 
4.5 % on average. For some of the lower-margin ABC Company offerings, it would likely result 
in discontinuing the line and using the more expensive PCBs on higher-end models that could 
carry more margin.

goods sold. In an effort to avoid being single-sourced, ABC 
Company finalized agreements with five different suppliers

The country in which ABC Company conducts most of their PCB 
business has seen a new regime assume governmental 
authority. In February of 2019, this now-corrupt regime passed 
legislation establishing an additional 20 % tax on all electronic 
components and goods sold outside of the country. This law was 
to take effect on June 1, 2019. 
When the new law was announced, the current ABC Company 
inventory of PCBs was about 10 % of yearly demand, at the 
typical level of inventory with which they were comfortable. 
Before June, ABC Company reached out to all five suppliers to

SCENARIO 2: Telecommunications Counterfeits 
Background  
A large enterprise, ABC Company, has developed a system that is maintained by contract with 
an external integration company. The system requires a common telecommunications element 
that is no longer available from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The OEM has 
offered a newer product as a replacement, which would require modifications to the system at a 
cost of approximately $1 million. If the element is not upgraded, the agency and system 
integrator would have to rely on secondary market suppliers for replacements. The newer 
product provides no significant improvement on the element currently being used.  
ABC Company has decided to perform a threat scenario analysis to determine whether to modify 
the system to accept the new product or accept the risk of continuing to use a product that is no 
longer in production. 
Environment 
The environment is characterized as follows: 
• The system is expected to last 10 more years without any major upgrades or 
modifications and has a 99.9 % uptime requirement.  
• Over 1,000 of the $200 elements are used throughout the system, and approximately 10 
% are replaced every year due to regular wear-and-tear, malfunctions, or other reasons. 
The integrator has an approximate 3-month supply on hand at any given time.  
• The element is continuously monitored for functionality, and efficient procedures exist to 
reroute traffic and replace the element should it unexpectedly fail.  
• Outages resulting from the unexpected failure of the element are rare, localized, and last 
only a few minutes. More frequently, when an element fails, the system’s functionality is 
severely reduced for approximately one to four hours while the problem is diagnosed and 
fixed or the element replaced.  
• Products such as the element in question have been a common target for counterfeiting.  
• The integrator has policies that restrict the purchase of counterfeit goods and a procedure 
to follow if a counterfeit is discovered [Ref. SR-11].  
• The integrator and acquiring agency have limited testing procedures to ensure 
functionality of the element before acceptance [Ref. SR-5(2)]. 
Threat Event 
To support the threat scenario, the agency created a fictitious threat source described as a group 
motivated by profit with vast experience creating counterfeit solutions. The counterfeiter is able 
to make a high profit margin by creating and selling the counterfeits, which are visually identical 
to their genuine counterparts but use lower-quality materials. The counterfeiters have the 
resources to copy most trademark and other identifying characteristics and insert counterfeits 
into a supply chain commonly used by the enterprise with little to no risk of detection. The

CYBERSECURITY SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT 
PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
177

counterfeit product is appealing to unaware purchasing authorities as it is generally offered at a 
discount and sold as excess inventory or stockpile. 
If an inferior quality element was inserted into the system, it would likely fail more often than 
expected, causing reduced functionality of the system. In the event of a large number of 
counterfeit products randomly integrating with genuine parts in the system, the number and 
severity of unexpected outages could grow significantly. The agency and integrator decided that 
the chances that a counterfeit product could be purchased to maintain the system and the 
estimated potential impact of such an event were high enough to warrant further evaluation. 
Threat Scenario Analysis 
The person(s) who purchase the element from a supplier would be the first affected by a 
counterfeit product. Policy requires that they attempt to purchase a genuine product from vetted 
suppliers. This individual would have to be led to believe that the product is genuine. As the 
counterfeit product in question is visually identical to the element desired and offered at a 
discount, there is a high chance that the counterfeit will be purchased. One will be tested to 
ensure functionality, and then the items will be placed into storage.  
When one of the elements in the system needs to be replaced, an engineer will install a 
counterfeit, quickly test to ensure that it is running properly, and record the change. It could take 
two years for the counterfeit product to fail, and up to 200 counterfeit elements could be inserted 
into the system before the first sign of failure. If all of the regularly replaced elements are 
substituted for counterfeits and each counterfeit fails after two years, the cost of the system 
would increase by $160,000 in 10 years. The requisite maintenance time would also cost the 
integration company in personnel and other expenses. 
When a counterfeit fails, it will take approximately one to four hours to diagnose and replace the 
element. During this time, productivity is severely reduced. If more than one of the elements fails 
at the same time, the system could fail entirely. This could cause significant damage to agency 
operations and violate the 99.9 % uptime requirements set forth in the contract. Moreover, if it 
becomes determined that the element failed because it was counterfeit, additional costs 
associated with reporting the counterfeit would be incurred. 
Mitigation Strategy 
The following were identified as potential mitigating activities (from Appendix A of NIST SP 
800-161, Rev. 1): 
• Require developers to perform security testing/evaluation at all post‐design phases of the 
SDLC [Ref. SA-11].  
• Validate that the information system or system component received is genuine and has 
not been altered [Ref. SR-11].  
• Incorporate security requirements into the design of information systems (security 
engineering) [Ref. PL-8, SC-36].  
• Employ supplier diversity requirements [PL-8(2)].

PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1 
Based on these controls, the agency was able to devise a strategy that would include: 
• Acceptance testing: The examination of elements to ensure that they are new, genuine, 
and that all associated licenses are valid. Testing methods include, where appropriate,  
physical inspection by trained personnel using digital imaging, digital signature 
verification, serial/part number verification, and sample electrical testing.  
• Increasing security requirements in the design of the system by adding redundant 
elements along more critical paths (as determined by a criticality analysis) to minimize 
the impact of an element failure.  
• Search for alternative vetted suppliers/trusted components. 
It was determined that this strategy would cost less than accepting the risk of allowing 
counterfeits into the system or modifying the system to accept the upgraded element. The 
estimated cost of implementing a more rigorous acquisition and testing program was $80,000. 
The cost of increasing security engineering requirements was $100,000.
