User: I don't want to use external modules like paramiko or fabric. Is there any python built in module through which we can transfer files from windows. I know for linux scp command is there like this is there any command for windows ?
Assistant: Server
python -m http.server
this will create a http server on port 8000
client
python -c "import urllib; urllib.urlretrieve('http://x.x.x.x:8000/filename', 'filename')"
where x.x.x.x is your server ip, filename is what you want to download
