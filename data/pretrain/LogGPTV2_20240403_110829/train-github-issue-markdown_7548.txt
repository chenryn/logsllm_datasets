FEATURE REQUEST: Per destination bandwidth shaping
While it's now possible to add a per-pod bandwidth limit with annotations
`kubernetes.io/{ingress,egress}-bandwidth` this limit is set on the pod
regardless of the trafic's origin/destination.
In our use-case we would like to host containers for other companies in our
Kubernetes cluster. While we would like the locallocal bandwidth to be
unlimited, we want to limit the internet-egress bandwidth of theses pods to
avoid paying egress charges on them.  
Another option would be per-deployment internet-egress accounting but I
couldn't find anything on this.
