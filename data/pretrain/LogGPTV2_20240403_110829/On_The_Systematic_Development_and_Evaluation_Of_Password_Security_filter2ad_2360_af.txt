| **Scenario** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **13** | Mr. Schmidt brings his personal smartphone to work but does not use it for business purposes. He wants to prevent friends or colleagues from accessing the phone by guessing his PIN. Since he shares the phone with his wife in their free time, she should be able to easily remember the PIN. Therefore, Mr. Schmidt uses the birthday of their family dog as the PIN, which is only known to him and his wife. |
| **14** | Mr. Schmidt finds it difficult to remember passwords. For his work laptop, he uses "Alexander1997" as the password, which is derived from the first name and birth year of his child. |
| **15** | Mr. Schmidt needs to perform small design tasks and must create an Adobe account to purchase and download software like Photoshop and InDesign. For this user account, he chooses a long, secure password (substantially longer than 8 characters) that is not in any list of commonly used passwords and is not derived from the company name "Adobe." |
| **16** | Mr. Schmidt struggles to remember all the passwords he needs for both work and personal use. To create secure passwords, he uses keyboard walks such as "1q2w3e4r%." |
| **17** | Mr. Schmidt frequently travels on business trips and once nearly had his laptop stolen at an airport. To enhance security, he encrypts the hard drive and sets a login password with more than 20 characters, created by concatenating multiple words. |
| **18** | The company where Mr. Schmidt works uses an external web service to store important client data. This service was recently targeted by a successful hacker attack, and password data was stolen. Mr. Schmidt's password, "Al3xand3r!," is derived from his son's name. Despite the breach, he does not change the password because it is longer than 8 characters and contains numbers and a symbol. Additionally, due to the difficulty in remembering multiple passwords, he requests the IT department to install a password manager on his work laptop. He chooses a master password with more than 20 characters, created by concatenating multiple words, to synchronize with his business smartphone. |
| **20** | Mr. Schmidt needs to use many passwords daily to access various systems. He also works on his business smartphone, so he saves all the passwords in a Word document and synchronizes this document through a public third-party cloud storage provider between his laptop and smartphone. |
| **21** | Mr. Schmidt uses different external web services, as is common in his company. For one of these services, the password can be reset using personal security questions. Instead of answering truthfully, he chooses a random character sequence as answers, writes it down, and stores it securely. |
| **22** | Mr. Schmidt uses various web services in his personal life. For one of these services, the password can be reset via a link sent to his email. He uses "@lex@nder1997" as the password for the respective email account, derived from his son's first name and birth year, because it is more than 8 characters long and contains multiple special characters. |
