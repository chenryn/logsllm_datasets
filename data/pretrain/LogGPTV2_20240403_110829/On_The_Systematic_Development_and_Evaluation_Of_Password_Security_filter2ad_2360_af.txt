Scenario
#
13 Mr. Schmidt takes his private smartphone to work (but does not use it for business purposes). He does not want that
friends or colleagues can access the phone by guessing his PIN. Since he shares the phone with his wife in their
free-time, she should be able to easily re-member the PIN. Therefore Mr. Schmidt uses as PIN the birthday of the
family dog, which is only known to him and his wife.
e 14 Mr. Schmidt nds it dicult to remember passwords. Therefore, he uses as password for his laptop at work Alexan-
der1997, the rst name and the year of birth of his child.
15 Mr. Schmidt has to perform small design tasks. For this purpose, he has to open an account with Adobe to purchase and
download software such as Photoshop and InDesign. For the user account, he chooses a long password (substantially
longer than 8 characters), which is neither in the lists of frequently chosen passwords nor derived from the company
name Adobe.
e 16 Mr. Schmidt has problems remembering all the passwords he needs for his job and privately. Therefore, he uses walks
on the keyboard, such as 1q2w3e4r%, to create secure passwords.

e 17 Mr. Schmidt is frequently on business trips and once he had his laptop almost stolen at the airport. Therefore, he
encrypts its hard drive and chooses to encrypt the hard drive and to login a password with more than 20 characters
which he creates concatenating multiple words to one another.
e 18 The company in which Mr. Schmidt is employed uses an external web service to store important client data. Mr.
Schmidt learns that this web service was the target of a successful hacker attack and that password data was stolen.
His password is Al3xand3r!, derived from the name of his son. Since the password is longer than 8 characters and
contains multiple numbers and a symbol he does not change it.
Since Mr. Schmidt has problems remembering the many passwords he needs for his job, he asks the it-department
whether they can install a password manager on his work laptop. Since he wants to synchronise the passwords to his
business smartphone, he chooses a master password with more than 20 characters, which he creates by concatenating
multiple words.
e 20 Mr. Schmidt has to use many passwords in his daily job to log on to all the dierent systems needs to access. Since he
also works on his business smartphone, Mr. Schmidt saves all the passwords in a Word document and synchronises
this document through a public third-party cloud storage provider between his laptop and his smartphone.

e 21 Mr. Schmidt uses dierent external web services, as is usual in his company. For one of the web services, the password
can be reset using personal security questions. Instead of answering the questions truthfully, Mr. Schmidt chooses a
random character sequence as answers, writes this sequence down, and stores it where only he can access it.
e 22 Mr. Schmidt uses dierent web services in his private life. For one of the web services the password can be reset using
a link in an email sent to him. As password for the respective email account he chooses @lex@nder1997 (derived
from the rst name and year of birth of his son), since it is more than 8 characters long and contains multiple special
characters.
