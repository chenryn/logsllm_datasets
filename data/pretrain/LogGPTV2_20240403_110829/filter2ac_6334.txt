title:blackhat:eu-22 Practically-exploitable Cryptographic  Vulnerabilities in Matrix
We report several practically-exploitable cryptographic vulnerabilities in the Matrix standard for federated realtime communication and its ﬂagship client and prototype implementation, Element. These, together, invalidate the conﬁdentiality and authentication guarantees claimed by Matrix against a malicious server. This is despite Matrix’ cryptographic routines being constructed from well-known and studied cryptographic building blocks. On the one hand, one of our attacks proceeds by chaining three attacks to achieve a full authentication and conﬁdentiality break. On the other hand, the vulnerabilities we exploit differ in their nature (insecure by design, protocol confusion, lack of domain separation, implementation bugs) and are distributed broadly across the different subprotocols and libraries that make up the cryptographic core of Matrix. Together, these vulnerabilities highlight the need for a systematic and formal analysis of the cryptography in the Matrix standard.
