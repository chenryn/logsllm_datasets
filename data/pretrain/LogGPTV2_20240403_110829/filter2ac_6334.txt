### Title: Blackhat EU-22: Practically-Exploitable Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in Matrix

We have identified several practically-exploitable cryptographic vulnerabilities in the Matrix standard, a protocol for federated real-time communication, as well as in its flagship client and prototype implementation, Element. These vulnerabilities collectively undermine the confidentiality and authentication guarantees claimed by Matrix against a malicious server. This is particularly concerning given that Matrix's cryptographic routines are built from well-known and well-studied cryptographic components.

One of our attacks demonstrates a full break in both authentication and confidentiality by chaining together three distinct vulnerabilities. Additionally, the vulnerabilities we have uncovered vary in nature, including issues that are insecure by design, protocol confusion, lack of domain separation, and implementation bugs. These vulnerabilities are distributed across the various subprotocols and libraries that form the cryptographic core of Matrix.

These findings underscore the need for a systematic and formal analysis of the cryptography in the Matrix standard to ensure robust security and prevent such vulnerabilities in the future.
