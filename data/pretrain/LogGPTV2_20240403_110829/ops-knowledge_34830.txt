User: I have a Python program I run at all times of the day that alerts me when something I am looking for online is posted. I want to give this to my employees but I only want to have it email them during business hours.
I have a Ubuntu server and use a .sh. I have a command in crontab that runs on startup.
How do I make my command run from 9-5?
Assistant: You could create a cronjob that starts the script every 5 minutes (or whatever often you want it to run) and additionally modify the script such that it creates a .lock file which it removes on exiting, but if it encounters it at the beginning it won't do anything (this way you don't have a long-running script active multiple times).
