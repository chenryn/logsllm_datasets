their buﬀer could act as relays and propagate these episodes
to other users.
The choice of the dissemination method is guided by sev-
eral factors, including the rate and the cost of the downloads,
and the tolerance to delays of the users (e.g., are users will-
ing to play podcast episodes just after they are published
or can users wait to be directly connected to the Internet
before playing episodes?).
If the delay tolerance of users
is high enough, say more than one day, the most economic
and eﬃcient way of downloading podcast episodes is ob-
viously through direct Internet connection, e.g., at home.
When the content of podcast is more time-critical, which
could be the case for news or sports podcasts, users have
to rely either on 3G cellular networks or on peer-to-peer
assisted communication.
It is worth noting that most of
the 3G wireless providers already propose push-based ser-
vices to broadcast news, e.g., live sport news. However,
the volume of information broadcasted on these services is
limited and much lower than the typical volume of pod-
cast episodes. The cost of downloading podcast episodes
through 3G networks may be signiﬁcant, especially in roam-
ing situations. Note that 3G providers usually impose lim-
ited monthly download cap, e.g., Sprint and AT&T typi-
cally impose a 5 GBytes monthly limit, and a few hundreds
MBytes when roaming. For this reason, users may prefer
to download podcast episodes through free peer-to-peer as-
sisted systems rather than through 3G networks, especially
when these users subscribe to several podcasts.
In the remaining of this section, we investigate the oppor-
tunity and the feasibility of peer-to-peer assisted podcast
dissemination. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst study user delay tol-
erance when playing podcast episodes; we investigate the
typical volume of episodes that users have to download for
example over a month; and ﬁnally, we examine the feasibility
of device-to-device communication, e.g., are device-to-device
contact times suﬃciently long to transfer one or several typ-
ical podcast episodes?

ability of subscribing to a podcast is proportional to
the number of existing subscriptions of that podcast.

cast. Removing biases due to high-rate publish pod-
casts does not aﬀect the median virtual age observed
in Fig. 29.
on mobile devices typically occurs sooner after the publish
time than on personal computers.
The distribution in Fig. 29 may be biased to podcasts with
high episode publish rates and to popular podcasts whose
episodes are played by many users as the distribution is for
the aggregate of samples across episodes and users. In order
to account for these biases, for each podcast we compute
the median virtual age; the values are presented in Fig. 30.
Again, we observe that the median of median virtual ages
over podcasts is in the order of 10 days (11.73 days), thus
of the same order as already observed in Fig. 29.
We further studied whether the episodes of the more popu-
lar podcasts are played sooner than those of the less popular
ones. In Fig. 31, we show samples of the virtual age versus
the total number of subscriptions of the corresponding pod-
cast along with the average values computed over bins of the
number of subscriptions. Interestingly, the results suggest a
lack of bias with respect to the popularity of the podcasts;
the mean virtual age remains roughly constant over a wide
range from a few to tens of thousands of subscriptions.
We examined the same statistics as reported above under
various other conditionings such as on the category of pod-
casts, individual podcasts, and the time of day and in all
these cases the observations consistently remained; we omit
the details for space reasons.
In summary, we observed that for typical podcasts, the
delay tolerance is in the order of tens of days; we found
that the median delay tolerance is about 10 days and is
1 day or shorter for as few as 1% of podcasts. These are
important observations; they suggest that for typical pod-
casts, it suﬃces to synchronize the content a few times a
day. Thus, it seems suﬃcient to rely on the dissemination
through sporadic access to the Internet (e.g., while the de-
vice is connected to a PC when the user is at home or oﬃce).
The P2P case would be of interest for the dissemination of
podcasts whose delay tolerance is less than a day, case which
was rare in our data. However, such scenarios might become
prominent in the future as interactive-like services such as
twitter grow in popularity. We note also that P2P dissemi-
nation would be of interest in scenarios where the Internet
access is limited, e.g., while on travel or at places with lim-
ited infrastructure.
Figure 29: Virtual age of episodes. The median
virtual age is around 10 days, which implies delay-
tolerant users.
5.1 Delay Tolerance
It is important to know the time horizon over which the
content is of interest to users since its publish time. In order
to evaluate the horizon of interest, we consider the age of
podcast episodes at their play times. Concretely, for each
episode of a podcast, we record its publish time and the
ﬁrst play time of the given podcast by distinct users after a
publish time. We call virtual age, the diﬀerence between
the latter play and publish times. Note that the virtual age
provides a lower bound on the actual age of the episode at
its play time by a user, as the user may well play some other
episode of the given podcast. (We had no information about
which speciﬁc episode of a podcast is played by a user.)
The distribution of the virtual age is showed in Fig. 29.
Note that this distribution is computed by taking samples
of virtual age across all episodes and all users who played
a released episode. Fig. 29 also shows the distribution of
the virtual age, conditional on the type of the end-device
(either mobile device or personal computer). Interestingly,
we observe that the median virtual age is as large as about
10 days. Moreover, a signiﬁcant portion of the episodes are
of the age of a month or longer. We also note that playing

ularity. The virtual age does not appear correlated
with the podcast popularity.

over users.
5.3 P2P Device-to-Device Dissemination
In this section, we consider the eﬃciency of P2P assisted
dissemination that relies on device-to-device communica-
tions. In particular, we consider how the contacts between
devices would be utilized under typical podcast ﬁle sizes and
typical contact durations. For typical ﬁle sizes we refer to
our analysis in Sec. 3 which suggests a typical ﬁle size of
15 MBytes for an audio podcast episode and 30 MBytes for
a video podcast episode. For typical contact durations, we
refer to the measurements results in the literature which sug-
gest that many contacts may last 200 seconds or less; e.g., in
[8], Fig. 8, we ﬁnd that the contact durations are less than
100 seconds for about half of the contacts.
Table 5: Required contact durations for transfer of
a 20 MByte ﬁle.
Transfer rate (Mb/s)
Contact duration (sec)
1 - 54 (WiFi)
100 - 480 (LAN/USB-2)
0.512 - 8 (WAN)
160 - 2.93
1.6 - 0.33
312 - 20
Table 5 shows us that under standard physical transfer
rates, the time it takes to transfer a 20-Mbyte podcast ﬁle
may well be in the order of a few hundred seconds. These
transfer times would even be larger for a typical podcast
video ﬁle.
In view of the earlier discussion, the time to
transfer a podcast ﬁle between two devices may well exceed
typical contact durations. This suggests that one may need
to resort to slicing of the ﬁles in chunks in order to improve
the utilization the contact transfer opportunities.
6. RELATED WORK
Studies of podcasting services have been limited. Banerjee
et al [3] were among the ﬁrst to examine the characteristics
of podcasts by downloading podcast content from 875 pod-
cast streams. The authors examined properties such as the
ﬁle sizes, the release times and proposed a model for ﬁle
generation. Our study diﬀers both on the set of proper-
ties examined and also regarding the scale of the examined
podcasts.
Figure 32: CCDF of rate of downloaded Bytes per
week over users. The median is around 65Mbytes
per week per user.
5.2 The Download Costs
Here, we evaluate the volume of the podcasting content
that needs to be downloaded by a typical subscriber. This
translates to download costs as many wireless service providers
oﬀer data plans with caps beyond which charging is volume
based. We compute the download rate per user by summing
the generation rates of podcast subscriptions. Fig. 32 shows
the distribution of the download rate per user measured in
bytes per week. We observe that the median download rate
is about 65 MBytes per week. This corresponds to about
2 to 3 ﬁles since we already found that the typical ﬁle size
is in the range of 20 to 30MBytes (Section 3). This is also
conﬁrmed in Fig. 33 where we show the distribution of the
download rate in ﬁles per week. The median download rate
amounts to about 1/4 GBytes per month and this volume is
larger for a sizable portion of users; note that from Fig. 32
we have the download rate in the range 10 MBytes to 1
GByte per week for more than 80% of users. We conclude
that podcasting can amount to a signiﬁcant portion of a po-
tential wireless data plan, and thus the transfer through 3G
would need to be limited due to cost reasons.
221Cha et al [9] performed a study of user generated content
by crawling the YouTube and Daum sites. Their focus is on
content popularity where the authors observed the presence
of the Pareto principle. Our analysis conﬁrms that this is
also the case with podcast content. However, the overall
focus of our work is on podcasting content where users sub-
scribe to push-based services in contrast to the pull-based
model of YouTube. The evolution of content popularity has
also been examined in [10, 11]. The authors examine how the
popularity of Flickr images evolves and study how informa-
tion propagates through the Flickr social graph. Compared
to these studies, in this work, we examine a broader set of
properties pertinent also to device-to-device dissemination
systems.
With respect to podcasting dissemination services for mo-
bile devices, Lenders et al [12] were ﬁrst to propose an ar-
chitecture for a podcast dissemination system for mobile de-
vices. Speciﬁcally, they proposed a P2P assisted dissemi-
nation and examined several device-to-device content dis-
semination strategies through simulations. Our work diﬀers
in that we base our study on real-world data of a podcast-
ing service which we use to evaluate the actual beneﬁts and
feasibility of peer-to-peer assisted dissemination.
7. CONCLUSION
We have presented an exhaustive statistical analysis of
current podcast services, by exploiting a 70-day trace from
the Zune podcast social service. To stress-test the signif-
icance of the analysis, we have also partially analyzed ad-
ditional podcast service providers, namely iTunes US and
UK. To our knowledge, this paper reports the ﬁrst study of
large-scale podcast services both from publishers’ and users’
perspectives.
Speciﬁcally, we were able to characterize the statistical
properties of podcasts, in terms of their publishers, their
type and content, size and release frequencies of their episodes.
We have also investigated the popularity of podcasts, based
on both the number of received subscriptions and the num-
ber of times the corresponding episodes are played, and tried
to infer how users subscribe to podcasts depending on their
popularity. We further discovered that current podcasts
are often consumed a long time after the release of their
episodes, i.e., that the current podcast service is delay tol-
erant. As a consequence, eﬃcient dissemination of podcast
episodes is feasible even through a sporadic access to the
Internet. This observation may be revised in the future as
increasingly popular interactive podcasts appear.
