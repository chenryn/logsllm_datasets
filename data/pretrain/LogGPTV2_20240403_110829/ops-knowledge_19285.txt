User: This may be a duplicate, but I couldn't find the question anywhere, so I'll go ahead and ask:
Is there a simple way to delete a superuser from the terminal, perhaps analogous to Django's createsuperuser command?
Assistant: There is no way to delete it from the Terminal (unfortunately), but you can delete it directly. Just log into the admin page, click on the user you want to delete, scroll down to the bottom and press delete.
