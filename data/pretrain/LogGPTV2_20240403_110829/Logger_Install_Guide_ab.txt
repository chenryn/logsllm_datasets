Chapter 1: OverviewArcSight Logger is a log management solution that is optimized for extremely high event throughput, efficient long-term storage, and rapid data analysis. An event is a time-stamped log entry, such as a syslog message sent by a host, or a line appended to a log file. Logger receives and stores events; supports search, retrieval, and reporting; and can forward selected events for correlation and analysis to destinations such as a syslog server.How Logger Works
Logger stores time-stamped log entries and called events at high sustained-input rates. Logger 
compresses raw data, but can always retrieve unmodified data on demand, for forensics-quality litigation data. Logger can receive data in the form of normalized CEF events from ArcSight SmartConnectors, syslog messages, and log files directly from a device. Logger can then forward received events to a syslog server or ArcSight  ESM.SmartConnectors are the interface between Logger and devices on your network that generate events you want to store on Logger. SmartConnectors collect event data and normalize it into a Common Event Format (CEF). For more information, go to    and look for ArcSight Common Event Format (CEF) guide.

Installation and Configuration GuideInstallation and Configuration Guide
Once events have been stored on a Logger, you can do the following:
l Search for events that match a specific query.
l Generate reports of events of interest.
l Generate alerts when a specified number of matches occur within a given time threshold. Alerts can 	notify you by e-mail, an SNMP trap, or a Syslog message.
l Establish dashboards that display events that match a specific query.l Forward selected events to ArcSight  ESM for correlation and analysis.
l Forward events to a syslog server.
Logger for Security, Compliance, and IT Operations
Although Logger’s applicability spans a wide array of industries, its search, reporting, and alerting capabilities are directly applicable to security and compliance reporting, and for IT operations search.Logger ships with predefined content filters that define queries for commonly searched security, IT operations, and application development events. These include unsuccessful login attempts, the number of events by source, and SSH authentications on UNIX servers. Therefore, you do not need to define queries to search for many commonly searched events. You can also copy the predefined content filters and modifyMicro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 9 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
them to suit your needs, thus saving time and effort required to start writing queries from scratch. In addition, Logger also contains predefined reports for common security and device monitoring use cases. 
For a complete list of predefined content filters and predefined reports, refer to the ArcSight . Information about how to use predefined filters is included in "System Filters (Predefined Filters)" on page69.Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 10 of 74
Chapter 2: Deployment Planning
Before installing Logger, you should plan how you will store events and how long you need to retain them. Consider the information in the sections below when planning your deployment:
Getting the Latest Documentation
The latest version of the documentation for this release is available for download (in PDF format)  from the .You can also access the online help available in the Logger user interface (UI) by clicking Help from the Admin menu. 
Trial Licenses
All ArcSight Loggers come with a trial license (for EPS and GB per day) that you can use for a 90 day evaluation period. You can manage  licenses both by ArcMC or as Standalone ArcSight Logger. After the evaluation period is over, you will not be able to access  any Logger features until you insert a valid  license.Note: Once license is updated to EPS, GB license (Logger Standalone or managed by ArcMC) cannot 
be longer selected. 
The trial license gives you access to the following:
l All Logger features except Reporting.
l 20 EPS per day ingested license usage.
l Up to 24TB in bigger capacity appliances.After you upload a license, the reporting feature is enabled; the licensed daily license usage and storage volume are increased to the capacity of the license. The ingested daily license usage of your Logger is 
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 11 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
displayed under Configuration > Advanced > License Usage. You can view your daily data limit and other license information under System Admin >License & Update.To upload a new license, refer the System Admin chapter of the Logger Administrator's guide. 
Initial Configuration
The installation and initialization process sets up your Logger with an initial configuration described in the sections below. You can do additional configuration on Logger to implement your retention policies. See "Configuring Logger" on page50. For further information, refer to the Configuration chapter of the Logger Administrator’s guide.Logger’s initial configuration is described in the sections below:
Storage Volume
Logger storage volume varies not only by version but also by initialization process. For Software Logger, the storage volume is set up to 24TB or the available disk space, whichever is smaller.  For appliances, the storage volume is set to the model´s capacity (24TB being the maximum). You can expand the storage volume up to 24TB in Configuration > Maintenance Operations > Storage Volume Size Increase. Storage volume can be extended after installation, but not reduced.Caution: If the maximum capacity is exceeded, events will  fall out of storage. 
Storage Volume Space Increasing: 
When setting the disk space, reservation percentage needs to be included. For instance, if you want to use the maximum storage volume size of 24 TB in Logger, you must allocate 24TB and a minimum 10% of reservation (26.4 TB in total) of disk space in the bigger capacity storage appliances. To allocate storage volume properly, obtain the initial storage volume space (initial storage volume multiplied for 0.93). View the assigned space based on the license and, set the storage group disk space.For more information, see 
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 12 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
Storage Groups
Two storage groups, the Default Storage Group and the Internal Event Storage Group, are created automatically during Logger initialization.
These storage groups come preconfigured with the following settings:
Preconfigured Default Storage Group Settings| Attribute | Appliance Logger | Software Logger |
|---|---|---|
| Size |1/2 Storage volume capacity |1/2 Storage volume capacity |
| Retention Period |180 days |180 days |
Pre-configured Internal Storage Group Settings
| Attribute | Appliance Logger | Software Logger |
|---|---|---|
| Size |5 GB |3 GB |
| Retention Period |365 days |365 days |Logger can have a maximum of 50 storage groups— 2 that pre-exist on your Logger (Internal Storage Group and Default Storage Group) and 48 that you can create. 
Adding more storage groups in Logger is determined by the partition size and the storage volume available (up to 48 custom storage groups).Each storage group can have different settings. You can change the retention policy and size for all storage groups, but you can only change the name of the user-defined storage groups. For more information, see the  Configuration chapter of 
Search Indexes
Logger comes prepared for full-text searches, also frequently used fields are indexed during initialization. You can add additional fields to the index, but once a field has been added, you cannot undo the action. For more information, see the search chapter of theReceivers
The default installation includes several receivers. To start receiving events,  direct your events  to the default receivers. After initialization, you can create additional receivers to listen for events. Before a receiver can receive data, open the port through the firewall. For more information, see "Firewall Rules" on page15. 
You can also change and delete receivers or disable and enable them as needed.Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 13 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
Tip: Be sure to update the firewall configuration whenever you add or remove a receiver.
The following receivers are set up and enabled with the default installation:
l A UDP receiver: Enabled by default.l A UDP receiver: Enabled by default.
The UDP receiver is on port 514/udp for Logger Appliances. If you are installing Software Logger as root, the UDP receiver is on port 514/udp. For non-root installs, it is on port 8514/udp. If this port is already occupied, the initialization process selects the next higher unoccupied port.
l A TCP receiver: Enabled by default.l A TCP receiver: Enabled by default.
The TCP receiver is on port 515/tcp for Logger Appliances. If you are installing Software Logger as root, the TCP receiver is on port 515/tcp. For non-root installs, it is on port 8515/tcp. If this port is already occupied, the initialization process selects the next higher unoccupied port.
l A SmartMessage receiver: Enabled by default.To receive events from a SmartConnector, download the SmartConnector and set the Receiver Name to be “SmartMessage Receiver” when configuring the destination. The SmartMessage receiver listens on the same port as the User Interface,  443/tcp on Logger appliances, and typically 443/tcp on Software Logger installed as root, and 9000/tcp on Software Logger installed as non-root. The Software Logger ports may  vary.Logger also comes pre-configured with folder follower receivers for Logger’s Apache URL Access Error log, the system Messages log, and the system Audit log (when auditing is enabled on your Linux OS). You must enable these receivers in order to use them.
Note: Logger’s Apache URL Access Error Log, http_error_log, is similar in format to the Apache 
access_log. Only failed access attempts are included in the Apache URL Access Error Log.For Software Logger, the preconfigured folder follower receivers include:
l Var Log Messages: /var/log/messages 
l Audit Log: /var/log/audit/audit.log
l Apache URL Access Error Log: /userdata/logs/apache
/http_error_log
Note: The folder (follower receiver) for /var/log/audit/audit.log will only be created if 
/var/log/audit/ already exists on your system.Auditing is disabled on some Logger Appliance models. Logger Appliances that have auditing enabled will have the same pre-configured receivers as Software Logger.
When auditing is disabled on the system where Logger is installed, the pre-configured folder follower receivers include:
l Var Log Messages: /var/log/messages
l Apache URL Access Error Log: /opt/arcsight/userdata/logs/apache
/http_error_log/http_error_log

Installation and Configuration Guide
For instructions on how to enable the pre-configured receivers, see "Receivers" on page50. For more information about all Logger receivers, refer to the .
Firewall Rules
Before Logger can receive data, some ports must be opened through the firewall.l For Software Logger, you are responsible for setting up the firewall.  After you first install or upgrade to Logger7.0.1, you should configure the firewall to be open only for the ports required for your configuration. 
Caution: Micro Focus ArcSight strongly recommends that you configure your firewall and open 
only the required ports.only the required ports. 
l For the Logger Appliance,  the firewall is pre-configured. Micro Focus ArcSight provides a script you can 	use to update the firewall. 
Tip: Be sure to update the firewall configuration whenever you add or remove any service  that 
requires an open port for incoming traffic, such as a receivers or SNMP polling.

4. Enter set defaultgw , replacing  with your default gateway IP address.
5. Enter set hostname ., replacing . with 	the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the desired host.6. Enter set dns ,  , replacing each  with a search domain, and each  with the IP address of a name server.
Example: set dns domain1.company.com,domain2.company.com 192.0.2.1 192.0.2.2
Tip: When using multiple search domains, separate them with a comma, but no space. When 
using multiple name servers, separate them with a space but no comma.7. Enter set ntp    replacing  	with the NTP server you want to use to set the time. 
Example: set ntp time.nist.gov
8. Enter show config to review the configuration settings you entered in previous steps. If needed, 	change the settings.
Setting Up the Appliance for Remote AccessAll ArcSight appliances are equipped with an Micro Focus ProLiant Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) Advanced remote management card. Micro Focus strongly recommends setting up and configuring your appliance for out-of-band remote access. Doing so ensures that you or Customer Support (with your permission and assistance) can remotely access the console of your appliance for troubleshooting, maintenance, and power control.To set up your appliance for remote access, follow the instructions in the ProLiant Integrated Lights-Out User Guide available on the product's website. 
Note: The L7600 models require you to obtain and enter a license key. The iLO license is pre-
installed, but you should obtain and keep your iLO license key and documentation for potential future 
use. This license key can be used with any replacement appliance.Instructions for obtaining the license key are included on your License Entitlement Certificate. Once 
you have obtained the license key, log into iLO, and then go to Administration > Licensing to enter 
it.
