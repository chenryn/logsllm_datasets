planation is also applicable to Peru, because it is surrounded by several countries
that have a lot of malware infected networks such as Brazil and Mexico.

Insight 3. To understand malware distributions, we might put our focus
on not only high IP address population countries with large number of infected
networks, but also some low IP address population countries where large portions
of their networks seem to be infected. Malware infection of these low IP address
population countries could be aﬀected by geographical neighbors.
3.4 Remote Accessibility
Another category that we consider is the network openness or remote accessibil-
ity (i.e., whether a host can be directly accessed from remote hosts or not). As
we described in the previous section, one major scheme of ﬁnding new victims
of the Type I botnet is scanning remote hosts (or networks). Enterprise networks
are usually protected by several perimeter defending systems such as ﬁrewalls,
in an attempt to block malicious threats from remote hosts. However, not all
networks are protected as such and if they are not protected, malware can infect
internal unguarded hosts more easily. From this intuition, we build the following
hypothesis.
Hypothesis 4. Networks that are more open (more directly accessible from
remote hosts) might have more infected networks of Type I botnets than that of
Type II botnets.
We have tested the network accessibility by sending several Ping packets
(i.e., ﬁve ICMP echo request packets per host in our test) to several randomly
selected hosts in a network. If any of our Ping queries is successful in selected
hosts, we regard that the network is reachable from remote hosts, otherwise
we regard that the network is unreachable. This test has been already used
before to understand the network reachability by previous work [23]. Note that
this test may only show the lower bound of reachable networks, because some
perimeter defending systems (e.g., ﬁrewalls) block incoming ICMP packets, or
our randomly selected hosts may be not alive during testing. In this test, we
assume that each /24 subnet have the same network access control policy (i.e.,
if one of the host in the same /24 subnet is accessible from the remote host, we
consider that all hosts in the same /24 subnet might also be accessible).
In our test, we can access 54.32% of Type I infected networks, which is more
than half. This indeed shows that Type I infected networks are more open (remote
accessible). It conﬁrms our hypothesis, although we presume this ratio could
be higher for Type I. This could be probably explained by (a) our network
reachability test is only a low-bound estimation, and (b) more networks are
aware of malware scanning attacks and thus more (previously open) networks
installed ﬁrewalls. In the case of the result for Type II, it shows 46.85% networks
are accessible, which is much less than Type I. This is probably because the
infection vectors of Type II botnets do not depend on remote accessibility.
The result of Common is interesting, because it shows more than 60% of
networks are accessible. This implies that remote accessible networks are much
more vulnerable to malware attacks. It might be reasonable, because even though

network accessibility may not help Type II botnets infect hosts, at least it helps
Type I botnets.
In addition, we measure the remote accessibility of networks of three coun-
tries: Turkey, China and the United States. These countries show somewhat
interesting patterns (e.g., China has a lot of Type I infected networks, but has
relatively small number of Type II infected networks). In our measurement, we
ﬁnd that 64.09% of networks in China are accessible from remote hosts. This
corresponds with our previous prediction (i.e., networks in a country that has
a lot of Type I infected networks might be more accessible from remote hosts)
in section 3.2. We discover that 51.8% of networks are accessible in the case of
Turkey and 40.92% of the United States. This result seems to be reasonable,
because these countries are more vulnerable to Type II than Type I botnets.
Insight 4. Open (remote accessible) networks are more likely to be infected,
particularly by Type I infection. However, it does not mean that inaccessible
networks are much more secure, because malware (Type II infection) can still
infect hosts in protected networks by several smart attack methods such as social
engineering.
3.5 Dynamism of IP Address
Previous work has shown that a lot of bots used dynamic IP addresses [10]. We
want to investigate whether the networks with more dynamic IP addresses are
more vulnerable than those with static IP addresses for both types of botnet
infections.
Hypothesis 5. Places (or networks) with more dynamic IP addresses are
more prone to be infected by both types of botnets.
To understand this, we have analyzed how many infected networks are us-
ing dynamic IP addresses. For the analysis, we apply the technique of ﬁnding
dynamic IP addresses proposed by Cai et al. [23]. In their analysis, they used re-
verse DNS PTR records of each host. They believed that the reverse PTR record
can represent the status of a host and if some keywords of a reverse PTR record
represent dynamism of IP address, the host is likely to use dynamic IP address.
For instance, if a reverse PTR record of a host A is dynamic-host.abcd.com, it is
very likely for the host A to use dynamic IP address, because its reverse PTR
record has a keyword of dynamic-host. Note that this test only shows the lower
bound of dynamic networks due to the limitation of reverse DNS lookup and
selected keywords. Even though this test can not show all networks using dy-
namic IP addresses, it could give us information of which type of botnet has
more dynamic IP addresses. Based on this idea, we use the same keywords men-
tioned in [23] to ﬁnd hosts (and ﬁnally networks) which are likely to use dynamic
IP addresses. If we ﬁnd any host in a subnet using keywords representing the
dynamism, we simply consider that the subnet uses dynamic IP addresses.

Table 2. Comparison of the percentage of dynamic or static IP addresses of each type.
We have measured how many infected networks use dynamic IP addresses and
the results are summarized in Table 2. The results are quite interesting. In the
case of Type I, I EX, and II EX we ﬁnd that around 50% of infected networks use
dynamic and other 50% of infected networks use static IP addresses. However,
in the case of Common and Type II, infected networks use more dynamic IP
addresses than static IP addresses.
The result of Common matches the previous result [10] which mentioned dy-
namic IP addresses are more vulnerable. However, the result of Type I does not
fully match the previous result, i.e., Type I botnet infection does not have no-
ticeable preference on networks with more dynamic addresses. This is actually
reasonable because Type I botnets locate a remote victim by scanning the IP
address space regardless whether the target address is dynamic or static. In the
case of Type II botnet infection, we do observe infection preference on networks
with more dynamic addresses. This is also reasonable because there are probably
more home users in these (dynamic) address space who have less security aware-
ness and potentially more vulnerable computers and web browsing patterns.
Insight 5. Networks with more dynamic IP addresses are more vulnerable to
malware attacks. This is more noticeable in the case of Type II botnet infection
than Type I.
4 Neighborhood Correlation of Botnet Victims
In this section, we provide a prediction approach based on our insights obtained
in the previous section.
4.1 Watch Your Neighbors
Insight 1 in Section 3.1 points out that both types of botnets have heavily un-
even distributions of infected networks and there are several heavily (continuous)
infected areas in some part of the IPv4 space. This implies that infected networks
of both types of botnets might be close to each other, i.e., it is very likely for
them to be located in the same or similar physical locations and neighbor net-
works (e.g., belonging to the same /16 networks). This intuition has already
been discussed before and veriﬁed in some previous work for some Type I botnet
Cross-Analysis of Botnet Victims: New Insights and Implications

[9] [13] [2]. An interesting thing is that one of the previous work provides an
approach of predicting unknown victims based on the intuition and it predicts
unknown victims with more than 90% accuracy with only employing a simple
method (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁcation) [2]. However, this work has only
focused on the case of Type I botnets.
The reason for strong neighborhood (network) correlation of Type I botnets
is intuitive, because Type I botnets will very likely scan neighbor networks to
recruit new victims. Then, can we apply a similar prediction approach to Type
II botnets? At ﬁrst glance, this might not be the case because Type II botnets
have very diﬀerent infection vectors/types from Type I botnets. However, we have
also shown in the previous section that the distributions of both types of botnets
are continuous and seems to be close to each other (in Figure 1(a)). Thus, it is
hard to immediately draw a conclusion whether similar neighborhood correlation
could be found in Type II botnets or not. Next, we plan to empirically verify this
myth.
The previous work [2] has used the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classiﬁer
which is a very popular machine learning algorithm and it uses neighbor in-
formation for classiﬁcation. We also apply the KNN algorithm and select the
same features for the KNN classiﬁer used in [2]: /24 subnet address and physical
location of infected networks.
To perform this experiment, we ﬁrst prepare data for representing the class
of benign and malicious networks. At this time, the infected networks of Type
II botnets can be used to represent the malicious class. However, since we do
not have data for the benign class, we also collect many (at the same scale as
malicious networks) clean networks3 to represent it. When we collect benign
networks, we intentionally choose those which are close to infected networks in
terms of the IP address and physical location, and they could be also neighbors
of infected networks.
After the preparation, we divide each Type II botnet data (MegaD and Srizbi)
into two sets for training/testing. And then, we apply the KNN classiﬁer to
predict unknown infected networks.
As shown in Table 3, the prediction results are quite interesting. Even though
the prediction accuracy is lower than the case of Type I botnet (i.e., [2] reported
around 93% of accuracy), our predictor for Type II botnet (in both MegaD and
Srizbi cases) shows more than 88% accuracy with some reasonably small number
of false positives.
The results imply that Type II botnets also have the similar characteristics
as Type I botnets (i.e., if a host is infected, its neighbors are also likely to be
infected). Then, why does this happen? It may be very hard to ﬁnd concrete
answers or clues for this question (unlike the intuitive explanation for Type I
infection).
From our investigations, we could provide a possible answer. It may be caused
by its infection media. As we described before, one promising infection method of
Type II botnets is drive-by-download, which typically uses spam emails contain-

ing links to compromised web sites, to trick people into downloading malicious
binaries. Thus, the infection pattern of Type II botnet might highly depends on
who receives spam emails. We ﬁnd articles describing how spammers harness
email addresses [26] [27], and they point out that collecting mailing lists is one
of their main tasks. It is likely for mailing lists to contain email addresses be-
longing to similar locations (e.g., same company and same university). It implies
that spam emails are delivered to people who are likely to be close to each other
and thus victims infected by spam emails might also be close to each other.
4.2 Cross-Bonet Prediction
We have shown that if a host is infected by a Type II botnet, its neighbor net-
works are also likely to be infected by this Type II botnet. When we perform
this test, we treat data of MegaD and Srizbi separately. However we know that
these two botnets are very similar in terms of infection vectors. To conﬁrm the
similarity of their infected networks, we calculate a manhattan distance between
the distribution of the two types of botnets. The manhattan distance between
