## Environment & Settings
- **Celery Version**: 5.0.0
- **Redis Version**: 6.0 or greater

## Expected Behavior
As a new user of Celery, I am uncertain whether this should be reported as a bug or a feature request. I am also unsure about how to best address this issue myself, so I hope you can bear with me.

Redis 6.0 and later versions implement Access Control Lists (ACLs), which allow for user authentication (see [Redis ACL Documentation](https://redis.io/topics/acl)). However, when using the following broker URL:
```
redis://user:password@localhost:6379/0
```
Celery throws a `WRONGPASS` error. We expect Celery to connect to Redis using the correct `user:password` combination without throwing an error. 

Older Redis versions did not support ACLs. Upon inspecting the `_params_from_url` function in `celery/backend/redis.py` (line 277), it appears that Celery currently only supports a broker URL containing a password and no username, as indicated by the following line:
```python
scheme, host, port, _, password, path, query = _parse_url(url)
```
We would like Celery to support both the `user:password@host` scheme and the current `password@host` scheme to correctly handle the ACLs introduced in Redis 6.0 and later.

## Actual Behavior
Celery throws the following error:
```
[2020-10-18 02:35:54,748: ERROR/MainProcess] consumer: Cannot connect to redis://user:**@localhost:6379/0: WRONGPASS invalid username-password pair.
Trying again in 18.00 seconds... (9/100)
```

Please let me know if any additional information is needed.
