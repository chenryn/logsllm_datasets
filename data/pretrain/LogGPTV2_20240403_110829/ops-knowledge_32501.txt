User: New to programming and python altogether. In the book I'm learning from, the author suggested I find out the purpose of Pydoc.
I did a google search on it, and found a match (from Gnome Terminal) but it didn't make much sense to me. Anyone mind simplifying a bit?
Assistant: Just type pydoc in your terminal where you normaly run python. It will give simple explanation !. : )
