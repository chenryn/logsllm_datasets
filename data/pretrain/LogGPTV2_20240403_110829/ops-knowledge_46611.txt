User: How to harden the security of a server, including firewall configuration, intrusion detection, and file permission settings?
Assistant: Server security hardening requires a combination of various security measures. The following methods are recommended: 1. Close unnecessary services and ports to reduce the attack surface, and only open necessary services and ports, such as SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, etc. 2. Install and configure a firewall to restrict network access and only allow necessary access. You can use iptables or ufw under Linux, or use firewall software, such as firewalld. 3. Install and configure Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to detect and prevent intrusions in time. You can use to install open source software, such as Snort, etc. 4. Update and patch the system in a timely manner, restrict unauthorized user access, and set role-based access control (RBAC). 5. Strengthen access authentication security and increase password complexity. It is recommended to use two-factor authentication, such as using SSH key for remote access. 6. Regularly back up key data and separate the backup data from the system and network to reduce the risk of backup data being attacked. 7. Strengthen system log monitoring and auditing, prevent attackers from deleting or modifying logs, and ensure timely detection and tracking of attack behavior. Open source software such as Auditd and rSyslog can be used. 8. Configure reasonable parameters, including connection limit, maximum file open limit, waiting timeout setting, etc. It should be noted that no matter which method is used, it is necessary to carefully consider the actual situation, master the basic knowledge, and prevent the situation of "killing the enemy thousands of miles away, without 10,000 soldiers, directly containing strategic nuclear deterrence, and successfully seeking victory".
