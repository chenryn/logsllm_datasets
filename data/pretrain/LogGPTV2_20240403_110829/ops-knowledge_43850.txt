User: I need to make a file readable and writable in python. Currently the file is read-only. I am running on a Windows machine. I run the following code:


os.chmod(projectPath, stat.S_IWRITE | stat.S_IREAD)


on a file that needs to be read/write. But when I try to execute the file that needs to be read write, I get the following:


ISDEV : fatal error -2200: Could not overwrite file C:\WINDOWS\Temp\STixInstaller\STixInstallShield.ism


So obviously, it is not making the file read/write. I then check the file permissions and it is still read-only.
Any ideas why this fails or if there is an easier way to do this I am missing?
Assistant: Make sure you have permissions to change the file. Who is the owner of the file? Is it the one who runs the Python script? All these have to be taken into account.
