Question: "In a SELinux policy for an Android system, if a file labeled with 'sysfs' type in the platform policy is changed to 'sysfs_A' in a subsequent update, how does this affect the access of vendor domain 'v_domain' to the file, assuming the vendor policy remains unchanged?"
 "A": "The 'v_domain' will retain access because the file's label is backward compatible."
 "B": "The 'v_domain' will lose access because there is no policy for the new 'sysfs_A' type in the vendor policy."
 "C": "The 'v_domain' will gain additional access due to the new 'sysfs_A' label."
 "D": "The 'v_domain' access will not be affected since the SELinux policy is not concerned with file labeling."
Answer: B
