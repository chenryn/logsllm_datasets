**Presenter: Sean M. Bodmer**
- **Affiliation:** Savid Technologies, Inc.
- **Role:** Honeynet Researcher & Intrusion Analyst
- **Expertise:** Information Security/Criminal Sciences Researcher
- **Experience:** Over a decade in Information Security
- **Note:** Not a professional Behavioral Profiler, but an Intrusion Analyst with a focus on studying intrusion signatures and observables. Currently building a thesis on Attacker/Threat Profiling.

**Presentation Update:**
- This slide deck differs from the one on your CD.
- An updated brief will be provided to DEFCON for further review.
- Thank you in advance for your understanding.

**Objective:**
- To equip you with alternative concepts and methods for better performing intrusion analysis and attacker characterization in the context of cyber crimes and cyber criminals.

**Challenges for Security Professionals:**
- How can you protect your assets and better understand threats?
- How do you learn from attackers and threats?
- How can you effectively analyze the motives, intent, and behaviors of attackers?
- How can you prevent further attacks and enhance your security measures?
- How do you communicate your findings to senior leadership?

**Foundations of Behavioral Profiling:**
- **Definition:** Behavioral profiling, despite its negative connotations, is a literal term used to describe the process of making assumptions based on unique experiences and personality types.
- **Assumptions:**
  - The intrusion reflects the personality.
  - Methods and signatures remain consistent.
  - Personality traits do not change.
  - Focus on behavior, skills, abilities, resource accessibility, motivation, and complexity.
  - Requires a multi-disciplinary approach; being solely a profiler or network expert is insufficient.

**Case Study A: Jack the Ripper (1888)**
- **Background:** Unidentified serial killer in Whitechapel, United Kingdom, who mutilated five prostitutes.
- **First Use of Profiling:** Concepts of criminal profiling, fingerprinting, and other forensic techniques were poorly understood at the time.
- **Modus Operandi (MO):**
  - **Victim Type:** Prostitutes, middle-aged.
  - **Location:** Dark, secluded streets of Whitechapel (except for Marie Kelly).
  - **Murder Method:** Throat cut from left to right, victim mutilated.
  - **Post-Murder:** Body not concealed or moved, organs missing (possible cannibalism/fetishism).

- **Victims and Circumstances:**
  - **Mary Nicholls (31 Aug 1888):** Killed where found, no struggle, abdomen slashed.
  - **Annie Chapman (8 Sep 1888):** No struggle, disemboweled, uterus missing.
  - **Elizabeth Stride (30 Sep 1888):** Throat cut, no mutilation.
  - **Catherine Eddowes (30 Sep 1888):** Throat cut, abdomen laid open, kidney and uterus missing.
  - **Marie Kelly (9 Nov 1888):** Killed lying on bed, extensive body mutilation.

- **Suspects and Medical Knowledge:**
  - **Royal Plot Theory:** Alleged involvement of a royal duke and Freemasons.
  - **Medical Expertise:** Opinions varied among doctors who performed autopsies, with some suggesting the killer had medical knowledge.

- **Disorganized Crime Characteristics:**
  - Spontaneous, no planning, no tools except the murder device.
  - No prior contact with the victim, no rape or torture.
  - High violence, no attempt to hide the body.
  - Possible mutilation, necrophilia, or cannibalism post-murder.

- **Basic Profile of Jack the Ripper:**
  - Likely grew up in a poor household with unstable work and harsh discipline.
  - Possible exposure to sexual abuse, alcohol, drugs, or mental illness.
  - Shy, quiet, with a poor self-image and physical ailment.
  - Underachiever, possibly working in the industrial sector.
  - Socially isolated, no relationships, directing hate and anger towards women.
  - Motivated by sex, dominance, and power.
  - Stable killer, likely living in Whitechapel during the murders.

**Leveraging Capabilities:**
- Over a century of law enforcement experience can be leveraged to better understand threats and attacker motivations.
- Information systems now enable human analytical capabilities to move beyond simple network and post-mortem analysis.
- Considerations for implementation:
  - Recursive Learning Systems
  - Automated Signature Generation Systems
  - Managed Security Services
  - On-Site Contractors

**Criminal Investigative Analysis:**
- Review crimes from behavioral, investigative, and forensic perspectives.
- Assess facts, interpret offender behavior, and understand interactions with victims.
- Basic behavior exhibited in a crime scene reflects the individual's lifestyle, aiding in identifying the type of person involved.

**Technical Threat Analysis/Modeling:**
- **Common Components:**
  - Potential Attacks/Threats/Risks
  - Analysis
  - Countermeasures
  - Future Preparations
- **Approach:**
  - Identify key system vulnerabilities
  - Classify possible attackers
  - Determine attacker goals
  - Enumerate methods to achieve goals
  - Create a resolution plan

**Combining Profiling and Threat Analysis:**
- Sole reliance on post-mortem analysis is insufficient in the cyber age.
- Understanding the "who" and "why" behind attacks is crucial for prevention.
- Behavioral profiling helps security professionals better understand attacker motivations and methods.

**Principles of Combined Profiling and Threat Analysis:**
- Profiling for identification and apprehension
- Data collection and analysis into models for theoretical threat understanding
- Research to calculate motives and behaviors in specific attacks
- Model creation to predict probable next targets
- Understanding community trends and historical patterns

**Investigative Approaches:**
- **Inductive:**
  - Qualitative analysis lifecycle
  - Relies on guesswork and assumptions
  - Not recommended for professional investigations
- **Deductive:**
  - Quantitative analysis lifecycle
  - Relies on evidence and hard facts
  - Leverages over a century of information
  - Highly recommended for professional intrusion analysts

**Cyber Crime Scene Investigations:**
- **Assess Scene:**
  - Document all observables
- **Collect Evidence:**
  - Document, label, and store evidence for analysis
- **Collect Data Sources:**
  - Communicate with data handlers/managers
  - Document all sources
- **Analyze:**
  - Network and host forensics
  - Document all observables
- **Assessment:**
  - Generate attacker profile
  - Document modus operandi and signatures
- **Report:**
  - Generate intrusion report (technical, observables, threat profile)

**Case Study B: “HotterthanMojaveinmyheart” (Julio Ardita)**
- **Background:** Hacked into NASA, DoD, U.S. colleges, and international institutions.
- **Methods:** Used private telephone systems and Harvard University’s computer system to launch attacks.
- **Arrest:** Detected by USN San Diego, arrested in Argentina for hacking into telephone company facilities.
- **Outcome:** $15K in telephone service theft, millions in damages, resulting in a $5k fine and 3 years of probation.

**Analyzing the Event:**
- Consider the difficulty, target, and outcome.
- Analyze the threat using typology, victimology, and other methods.

**Attacker Characterization:**
- **Components:**
  - Events: What occurred by the attacker
  - Threats: Motives and intent of the attack
- **Characterization:**
  - Analyze session data (web servers, host security programs, IDS, honeynets)
  - Common attacker types: Naïve Novice, Advanced Novice, Professional Hacker, Disgruntled Employee, Corporate Espionage, Organized Crime, Hacker Coalition, Zealot Organization, Cyber Terrorist, Nation State Actor, Foreign Intelligence

**Attacker Profile Components:**
- Motivation
- Objectives
- Timeliness
- Resources
- Risk Tolerance
- Skills and Methods
- Actions
- Attack Origination Points
- Numbers Involved in Attack
- Knowledge Source

**Challenges in Attack Characterization:**
- **Cost:**
  - Personnel, equipment, software
  - Balancing productivity and business operations
- **Technology:**
  - Focus on standard security components (network sensing, boundary protection, COOP, disaster recovery)
- **Legal:**
  - Concerns about deploying profiling systems
  - Misunderstanding of defensive analysis technologies

**Being the Analyst:**
- Identify points of injection (source point)
- Trace the attack back to the source to understand how, what, when, why, and where
- Acquire internal assets for analysis, considering out-of-bounds systems and corrupted logs
- Post-mortem analysis is reactive, not proactive

**Case Study C: “Datastream Cowboy” and “Kuji”**
- **Background:** 26 days of attacks on USAF’s Rome Labs, 20 days of monitoring.
- **Details:** 7 sniffers, over 150 intrusions from 10 points of origin across 8 countries.
- **Cost:** $211,722 in damage to computer systems, plus investigative costs.

**Analyzing the Event:**
- Consider the difficulty, target, and outcome.
- Analyze the threat using typology, victimology, and other methods.

**Constructing Attacker Profiles:**
- **Definition:** A complete description of the individual who committed the crime, including their characteristics, motivations, and methods.
