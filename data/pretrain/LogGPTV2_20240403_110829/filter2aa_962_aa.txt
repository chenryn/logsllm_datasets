Everyone's Challenge
» What can you do as a Security Professional to 
protect your assets and better understand 
threats?
» How do you learn from attackers and threats?
» How can you use this to properly analyze the 
motives, intent, and behaviors?

–– Assumptions of Profiling
Assumptions of Profiling
• The rational relies on the uniqueness of experience & different 
personality types will be reflected in lifestyles & behaviors. This leads 
to assumptions about profiling:
– The intrusion reflects the personality
– The methods remain similar
– The signature remains the same 
– The personality will not change
– Analyzes the pattern of Individuals and Groups
• Focus on Behavior
• Skills and Abilities
• Accessibility to/use of Resources
• Motivation
• Complexity 
– Needs a multi-disciplinary approach
– Simply being an Profiler or Network Geek won’t get you thye complete

Case Study A
» 1888 A.D. - Jack The Ripper
– Unidentified Serial Killer
– Whitechapel, United Kingdom
– Mutilated 5 Prostitutes
» First case Profiling was actively utilized
– At that time the concepts of criminal profiling, fingerprinting, and 
other such knowledge and intelligence that have developer were 
poorly understood if not altogether unknown

Case Study A
» Suspects
–
A Royal Plot - This theory was by author Stephen Knight who talked to some 
grandson who said that his painter dad knew of a Royal duke who had a baby by 
a prostitute (who posed for the painter). So the Queen inscribed the help of her 
doctor and Freemasons (Lord Salisbury and Sir William Gull) who then killed the 
prostitute friends with each Jack the Ripper murder.
–
Doctors - Did Jack the Ripper need medical knowledge to kill his victims? Some 
doctor's said he did and some said he did not. Here are some comments from 
doctors who carried out autopsies on Jack's victims –
• Mary Nicholls - 'Deftly and skillfully performed.' - Dr Llewellyn.
• Annie Chapman - 'Obviously the work was that of an expert - or one, at 
least, who had such knowledge of anatomical or pathological examinations 
as to be enabled to secure the pelvic organs with one sweep of the knife.' -
Dr Phillips.
• Catherine Eddowes - 'A good deal of knowledge as to the position of the 
organs in the abdominal cavity.' - Dr Brown.
• Catherine Eddowes - 'No stranger to the knife.' - Dr Sequiera.
• Marie Kelly - 'No scientific or anatomical knowledge.' - Dr Bond.

Case Study A
»
Jack the Ripper's crimes were disorganized
–
Murder usually happens spur of the moment (with no planning but the one simple 
objective to kill)
–
Does not bring any tools ('rape kit') to the kill except maybe murder device
–
No contact with the victim prior to spur of the moment murder
–
No rape, torture etc. will take place before murder
–
Kills victim but does not care for evidence usually left at the crime scene (high 
degree of violence takes place at murder)
–
Will not move body in an attempt to hide, bury it etc., unconcerned of its 
discovery
–
Killer might be involved further with the dead victim (mutilation, necrophilia, 
cannibalism, etc) and may also take souvenir
»
Organization in an Intrusion provides an observable signature…
–
Knowledge of the Environment/Terrain
–
Extremely Skilled with Tools and Operating Systems

Case Study A

Basic Profile of Jack
–
Jack would probably of grown up in a poor household, where the fathers work was unstable 
and where he experienced harsh discipline
–
The family could of also been subject to sexual abuse, alcohol or drug problems, mental 
illness etc
–
Jack would of been a shy quiet type as he had internalized the painful emotions at home 
–
He would also have a poor self image with a disability or physical ailment, casting him from 
society and making him feel very inadequate
–
He would also be an underachiever and would probably have a menial job in the industrial 
sector
–
Jack would of been unable to live or socialize with other people, leading a very lonely life, the 
only people he would live with would be his parents or on his own
–
He would also have no relationships so his hate and anger would be aimed at the opposite of 
sex, but no rape, as he was very incapable
–
Jack's mental illness would have played a big part on the murder and mutilation of his victims
–
He would also take little to no interest in the murder after it was committed so he would of 
never sent any letters (the media did)
–
Jack's motive was of course : sex, dominance, and power
–
Jack was also a stable killer - a person who murders in the same basic area, so this means 
that it was quite definite that he lived right in Whitechapel in 1888.

Leveraging Capabilities
» There is over 100 years of experience from the Law 
Enforcement Community that you can leverage to better 
understand threats and the motivations of attackers
» That experience is key to understanding threats and 
increasing awareness…
» Information Systems are now at a point to  enable 
human analytical capabilities to move beyond simple 
network analysis and post-mortem analysis
» How do you know what implementation is best for you?
– Recursive Learning Systems?
– Automated Signature Generation Systems?
– Managed Security Services?
– On-Site Contractors?

Getting Scientific
» Criminal Investigative Analysis
– Review Crimes from a behavioral, investigative, and forensic 
perspective
– Reviewing and assessing the facts of the criminal act
– Interpreting offender behavior and interaction with the victim 
systems as exhibited during the crime or displayed in the crime 
scene
» A person’s basic behavior, exhibited in a crime scene, 
will also be present in that person’s lifestyle
– That is what helps determine the type of person you are looking 
for
Copyright ©2007 Savid Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Getting Technical
» Threat Analysis/Modeling
– Common Components
• Potential Attacks/Threats/Risks
• Analysis
• Countermeasures
• Future Preparations
» Common Analysis Approach:
– Locate key system vulnerabilities 
– Classify possible attackers
– Identify goals of attacker
– Enumerate possible ways to achieve goals
– Create resolution plan

Two Worlds Collide…
» Relying solely on and Post-Mortem analysis does not work 
in an age of “All Things Cyber”
» It is possible to take a deeper look at the behaviors and 
personalities of “who” is attacking your infrastructure 
» Now we need to understand the “who” and “why” to 
prevent further attacks 
» Behavioral Profiling defines how security professional can 
better understand the motivations and methods of 
attackers
Copyright ©2007 Savid Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Two Worlds have Collided
» Principals of combined profiling and threat analysis:
– Profiling of individuals for the purposes of identification and 
possible apprehension
– Collection and analysis of data into models that allow better 
theoretical understanding of threats
– Utilize research to assist in calculating motives and behaviors in 
specific attacks by groups/individuals
– Utilize research to create models of threats that involve variables 
such as to illustrate to stakeholders probable next targets of 
threats
– To understand where the community is going next or may have 
been previously

One more thing…
» Types of Investigations
– Inductive
• Qualitative analysis lifecycle
• Relies on guesswork and assumptions
• Not recommended for professional investigations
– Deductive
• Quantitative analysis lifecycle
• Relies on evidence and hard facts
• Capable of leveraging over a century of 
information
• Highly recommended for professional intrusion 
analysts

Case Study B
» “HotterthanMojaveinmyheart” AKA “El Griton,” Julio Ardita
–
Hacked into NASA, DoD, U.S. colleges, and colleges in Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, 
Chile and Brazil
–
Hacked into the private telephone systems of companies in his native Argentina, 
dialed into Harvard U’s computer system, and launched his U.S. hacking attacks 
through Harvard.
–
Caught: USN San Diego detected that certain system files had been altered -
they uncovered a sniffer file and a file that contained the passwords he was 
logging, and programs to gain root access and to cover tracks.  Argentine 
officials arrested him for hacking into telephone company facilities, seized his 
computers.
–
$15K telephone service theft, millions in damaged files and investigative costs 
yielded a $5k fine and 3 years of probation.

Thinking about Assessments?
» If you were an Analyst on this event
– How would you have analyzed the events?
• Would you consider the difficulty?
• Would you consider the target?
• Would you consider the outcome?
– How would one analyze this threat?
• Typology
• Victimology
• Other methods
Copyright ©2007 Savid Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Attacker Characterization
» Attack Characterization can has two primary components:
– Events – What has occurred by act of the attacker
– Threats – The motives, and intent of the attack
» Characterizing an attacker will rely on analyzing what you can see 
over the network
– Generally session data isn’t available through production resources
– Web servers retain session logs, which can contain keystroke logs
– Host security programs can be purchased that record user activity and 
session information
– Intrusion Detection systems are available that monitor session activity
– Honeynet technologies are available which configured properly can be 
deployed to monitor session level interactions
Copyright ©2007 Savid Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Attacker Characterization
» Common Attacker Types:
– Naïve Novice (hacker)
– Advanced Novice (hacker)
– Professional or Dedicated Hacker
– Disgruntled Employee (insider)
– Corporate Espionage (Professional Hacker)
– Organized Crime
– Hacker Coalition
– Zealot Organization
– Cyber Terrorist
– Nation State actor
– Foreign Intelligence
Copyright ©2007 Savid Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Attacker Characterization
» Components of an Attacker Profile
– Motivation – the level of intensity and degree of focus 
– Objectives - boasting rights, disruption, destruction, learn secrets, make 
money
– Timeliness - how quickly they work (years, months, days, hours) 
– Resources - well funded to unfunded 
– Risk Tolerance – high (don’t care) to low (never want to be caught)
– Skills and Methods - how sophisticated are the exploits (scripting to 
hardware lifecycle attacks)
– Actions - well rehearsed, ad hoc, random, controlled v. uncontrolled
– Attack Origination Points – outside, inside, single point, diverse points
– Numbers Involved in Attack - solo, small group, big group
– Knowledge Source - chat groups, web, oral, insider knowledge, 
espionage

Challenges in Attack Characterization
» Cost
– Personnel (Skilled Talent)
– Equipment
– Software
– Productivity versus Business Operations
» Technology 
– Most security budgets only focus on standard components
• Network sensing equipment
• Boundary protection devices
• Continuity of Operations (COOP)
• Disaster Recovery
» Legal
– Most organizations are nervous to deploy attacker analysis 
systems that could be considered  capable of “Profiling”
– Most do not understand the true legal nature of defensive 
analysis technologies
Copyright ©2007 Savid Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Being the Analyst
» Identifying the points of injection (source point)
– Tracing an attack or insertion point back to the source to learn:
• How
• What
• When
• Why
• Where
– Acquiring all of the internal assets to perform analysis
• Some systems are out of bounds for analysis
– Either you do not own or you are not allowed to analyze
• Some logs could have been destroyed or corrupted during the 
incident
– Post Mortem is reactive and not pro-active
• You don’t learn as much while attempting to remediate your incident 
and return your network to normal operating levels
Copyright ©2007 Savid Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Case Study C
» “Datastream Cowboy” and “Kuji” attack USAF’s Rome Labs
– 26 days of attacks; 20 days of monitoring
– 7 sniffers, over 150 intrusions from 10 points of origin from 8 different 
countries
– Priceless cost to national security, but $211,722 to undo damage to 
computer systems.  
• Investigative costs also not included
