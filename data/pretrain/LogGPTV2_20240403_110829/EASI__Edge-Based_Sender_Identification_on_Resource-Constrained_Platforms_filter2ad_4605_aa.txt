Abstract—In vehicles,
internal Electronic Control Units
(ECUs) are increasingly prone to adversarial exploitation over
wireless connections due to ongoing digitalization. Controlling
an ECU allows an adversary to send messages to the internal
vehicle bus and thereby to control various vehicle functions.
Access to the Controller Area Network (CAN), the most widely
used bus technology, is especially severe as it controls brakes
and steering. However, state of the art receivers are not able to
identify the sender of a frame. Retroﬁtting frame authenticity,
e.g. through Message Authentication Codes (MACs),
is only
possible to a limited extent due to reduced bandwidth,
low
payload and limited computational resources. To address this
problem, observation in analog differences of the CAN signal
was proposed to determine the actual sender. Some of
the
prior approaches exhibit good identiﬁcation and detection rates,
however require high sampling rates and a high computing effort.
With EASI we signiﬁcantly reduce the required resources and
at the same time show increased identiﬁcation rates of 99.98%
by having no false positives in a prototype structure and two
series production vehicles. In comparison to the most lightweight
approach so far, we have reduced the memory footprint and
the computational requirements by a factor of 168 and 142,
respectively. In addition, we show the feasibility of EASI and
thus demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that voltage-based sender
identiﬁcation is realizable using comprehensive signal character-
istics on resource-constrained platforms. Due to the lightweight
design, we achieved a classiﬁcation in under 100 µs with a training
time of 2.61 seconds. We also showed the ability to adapt the
system to incremental signal changes during operation. Since cost
effectiveness is of utmost importance in the automotive industry
due to high production volumes, the achieved improvements are
signiﬁcant and necessary to realize sender identiﬁcation.

INTRODUCTION
Vehicles can no longer be considered as closed systems, as
they are increasingly equipped with functionality that interacts
with the environment [35], [25], [52], [61]. This includes local
connections offered directly by the vehicle, such as Bluetooth
or WiFi, in order to control various functions or to retrieve in-
formation via smartphones. But also retroﬁttable solutions, e.g.
in the form of diagnostic dongles, offer additional interfaces to
the vehicle, which can be affected by vulnerabilities [18]. In

addition, modern vehicles are increasingly equipped with mo-
bile cellular connections in order to access cloud services and
to communicate with other road participants. Besides useful
services, these interfaces also offer attackers the possibility to
manipulate the vehicle and its ECUs without prior physical ac-
cess, as shown by several researchers [7], [60], [43], [62]. Once
an ECU is compromised, an attacker can remotely control or
inﬂuence the vehicle respectively individual functions [43],
[36], [42], [23]. In particular, it turned out that the lack of
security mechanisms for the CAN [53], which is still the most
used standard, enables the manipulation of internal vehicle
communication [25]. Thus, it is possible for a remote attacker
to send forged messages from compromised ECUs, which in
turn enables the control of vehicular functions, as demonstrated
by Miller and Valasek [43]. Their work on a Jeep Cherokee led
to a recall of 1.4 million vehicles. Another demonstration is
provided by the work of the Tencent Keen Security Lab [62],
[5]. The research team discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
various BMW models,
including the ability to manipulate
ECUs connected via CAN over a wireless connection. This
fundamental problem has already been criticized by consumer
watchdogs, resulting in a demand for a vehicle kill switch [13]
in connected vehicles.
The implementation of cryptographic measures on CAN is
only possible with restrictions [66], [39], [20], [34]. This is
due to the limited computing power of the ECUs, the small
available bandwidth and the short payload per CAN message.
For example, MACs are signiﬁcantly truncated [3] or only used
for a limited number of messages. In addition, it is not possible
to unambiguously determine the sending ECU using MACs,
since they do not provide non-repudiation. However, informa-
tion about the sender of a message is also relevant for Network-
based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) [25], [47], which are
expected to be a common security measure around 2023 [52].
These systems analyze the message trafﬁc and can detect attack
patterns or deviations from the expected behavior. One way to
react on intrusions is, besides to warn the driver [47], [24],
to update existing signature-based systems with the observed
attack patterns in order to be able to react quickly to zero
day exploits. This does not necessarily prevent an attack on
a particular vehicle, but immunizes the entire vehicle ﬂeet
and prevents potential major damage. The recognition itself
can e.g. be carried out in the cloud and appropriate measures
can be transmitted to the vehicles over the air. Knowledge
about
the sender would also improve detection rates and
accelerate the elimination of vulnerabilities, as the source
of the attack can be identiﬁed. Should this information be
provided by cryptographic measures, digital signatures have to
be implemented, whose usage is considerably more expensive.
As an alternative, approaches have been introduced which
enable the detection of attacks based on physical characteristics
[46], [9], [11], [12], [34]. Characteristics of sent CAN signals
are used to generate ﬁngerprints which can be utilized to
determine the sender. This enables detecting attacks with a
corresponding probability which require the forgery of frames
in order to be executed. In this way, Miller and Valasek’s attack
on the Jeep Cherokee could also have been detected at the point
where the researchers accessed the CAN bus via the compro-
mised multimedia system. Unfortunately, existing approaches
which use comprehensive signal characteristics require a high
sampling rate of up to 2.5 gigasamples per second (GS/s) to
generate the ﬁngerprints, which is not provided by standard
microcontrollers (MCUs). Besides additional hardware costs
for the measurement, this also results in large amounts of data
which have to be processed by the system in a limited period
of time, e.g. in less than 200 µs for a standard frame with
maximum payload. Should the calculation require too much
time, the system has to buffer many messages and also cannot
react quickly enough to detected attacks [63].
Some of the aforementioned approaches show good results,
but require high demands on the hardware. Even if high speed
MCUs are available and their general performance increases,
the costs of implementing security functions play a major
role [20]. This is especially true for the automotive sector [36],
[47], [25], [39], [20], [61], as security features are often
difﬁcult to monetize as they are viewed as a fundamental re-
quirement and not as an additional feature [26]. To address this
problem, we present EASI (Edge-Based Sender Identiﬁcation),
a novel approach which has signiﬁcantly lower requirements
and thereby increases the cost effectiveness and applicability of
the sender identiﬁcation for automotive networks. Compared
to the most lightweight approach [34], we were able to reduce
the requirements by two orders of magnitude, i.e. memory
utilization by a factor of 168 and the computing effort by 142.
Existing approaches extract the characteristics from the
symbols of the entire CAN frame. Our key insight is that there
are only minor changes in the characteristics within one frame.
Therefore, it is sufﬁcient to generate the ﬁngerprint from a
single symbol. This already allows a great reduction in the
amount of data, but not in the sampling rate. To achieve this,
only individual points of the actual signal are measured which
are combined afterwards to a representative symbol. Thus, our
proposed approach additionally reduces the required sampling
rate, enabling the implementation of ﬁngerprinting technology
using low-cost standard hardware. In addition, we demonstrate
for the ﬁrst
time that comprehensive signal characteristics
can be processed by machine learning algorithms on standard
MCU architectures which are comparable to hardware used
in actual ECUs. Besides the calculation of the characteristics,
this also includes the training of the model, its adjustment due
to drifts and the actual classiﬁcation. As a result, information
on the performance requirements of approaches using com-
prehensive signal characteristics are given for the ﬁrst time.
Based on the methodology of using only a single symbol we
tuned the system accordingly, which includes the optimization
of the utilized characteristics and a reﬁnement of the system
parameters like the necessary update procedure. Besides using
the data already used for the evaluation of Scission [34], we
extended the evaluation by a deeper analysis of a voltage-
aware attacker and a one-week drive involving the utilization
of electronic consumers. While keeping the identiﬁcation rate
high, we have improved the detection rate and showed also that
even attacks during drive could be detected with an accuracy
over 99 %. Besides the practical enablement, especially for the
automotive industry, our contributions are:

ﬁcation using comprehensive signal characteristics.
Optimization of system parameters to maintain a ro-
bust operation over a longer runtime.
Demonstration of feasibility on a standard low-cost,
resource-limited MCU, including model adjustments
to changing signal characteristics during runtime.
Evaluation on a prototype and two production vehicles
as well as under changing conditions over one week
involving different electronic consumers.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Controller Area Network
The CAN is a broadcast bus over which the internal ECUs
communicate via frames, containing up to 8 bytes of data.
The frames do not contain a receiver or sender address, but
an identiﬁer which speciﬁes the priority and meaning of the
transmitted data. Thus, an ECU can use multiple identiﬁers
exclusively. The identiﬁer is 11 or in extended format 29
bits long and is used by only one ECU in the corresponding
bus. Since CAN is a broadcast bus, it is possible that several
participants access the bus simultaneously, which would lead
to a faulty transmission. This is avoided by the Carrier Sense
Multiple Access/Collision Resolution [31], which ensures that
the frame with the highest priority prevails the arbitration
phase. During the arbitration, the sending ECUs observe the
current bit on the bus and compare it with the transmitted
bit. If both correspond, the next bit is transmitted, otherwise
the transmission is aborted and restarted as soon as the bus
is free. The bus consists of two twisted wires, CAN high and
low, which are terminated with 120 Ω. When a dominant bit (0)
is transmitted, CAN high is pulled to 3.5 V and CAN low to
1.5 V. A recessive bit (1) is represented by 2.5 V on both wires.
The ﬁnal voltage level, known as the differential signal, is then
determined by the subtraction of CAN low from CAN high. An
advantage of this procedure is that electromagnetic interference
affects both lines simultaneously and thus balances out in the
differential signal. If ﬁve identical bits are transmitted, an
additional contrary bit is inserted for synchronization, which
is called a stuff bit.
B. Cause of the Signal Characteristics
The characteristics of a signal are determined by the
transmitting ECU and the channel to the measuring point [4].
The generated signal during a voltage level change is in
theory a square-wave signal. In practice, however, square-wave
signals are characterized by rise and fall times, indicating
the time required for a signal
to reach its target value.
Among others, these are inﬂuenced by the capacitances and
2
inductances of the circuits and by the power supply of the
ECU respectively the transceiver [10]. The primary voltage
source used is a 12 V battery for passenger cars and 24 V
for trucks. The required operating voltage of 5 V is ensured
by voltage regulators, which also stabilize the voltage supply.
Due to manufacturing variations and imperfections, electronic
components differ slightly [44], leading to variations in the sig-
nals. For instance, resistors come with a tolerance of industry
typical 5 %. Furthermore, CAN actually requires a third cable
for grounding. But in practice, grounding is realized via the
vehicle chassis, which can result in different ground voltages
between individual devices [64]. Variations are also caused
by power reﬂections of a transmitted signal. This is affected
by impedance mismatches and non-linear changes in cable
characteristics, including the lengths and terminations of the
bus. All together, this may result in overshooting, what can be
followed by an oscillation of the signal, known as ringing [45].
Therefore, the topology has a considerable inﬂuence on the
signal waveform, since impedance mismatches mainly occur
at junctions and the devices.
III. EDGE-BASED SENDER IDENTIFICATION
A. Security Models
1) System Model: The structure of internal networks de-
pends fundamentally on the manufacturer and model. There are
simple vehicles with only one network, but also more complex
models whose internal network consist of several individual
buses. The buses are used for different functions, such as
powertrain, comfort or multimedia, and are interconnected
by gateways. In order to prevent
the system from being
bypassed, we assume that
the ECU on which the system
is implemented is protected by security mechanisms [52],
such as an Hardware Security Module (HSM) [65] and is
therefore considered trustworthy. HSMs are already available
for the automotive market, e.g. by the Inﬁneon Aurix [30]
platform. Especially the gateway is a suitable device for EASI,
which connects several buses and thus can react in case of an
attack depending on the malicious bus segment. Although the
simultaneous monitoring of multiple networks is possible, a
single CAN network or segment is considered in the following
for simpliﬁcation. In order to record the signals, the ECU on
which the system is implemented has a measuring point on
the monitored CAN network. This allows EASI to analyze the
CAN message signals and thus to decide if an intrusion is
present. Further, the sender identiﬁcation allows determining
the sending ECU if it is known by the system, which will
help to accelerate the elimination of the exploited vulnerability.
Since the communication ﬂow in vehicles is static, i.e. it is
known which ECU is allowed to send which identiﬁers, the
system can determine whether a message is legitimate or not.
In addition, we assume that the absence of periodic messages
or an increase in their frequency can be detected, as this can be
easily realized. Several approaches exist for this purpose [25],
[37], [47], [9].
2) Attacker Model: In principle, an attacker with bus access
can manipulate the vehicle functions by injecting messages,
due to the missing sender authenticity. By ﬂooding, periodic
signals can be overwritten, by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
the entire communication can be disturbed and through the
bus-off attack [8] ECUs can be disconnected from the bus.
These manipulations, which lead to additional or missing
messages, can be detected by monitoring the transmission
schedule. Therefore, in the following, a more intelligent at-
tacker is considered who aims to use aperiodic messages
or intends to take over the sending of periodic messages
unnoticed [55]. Since the identity of the sender cannot be
determined in CAN, the attacker can impersonate any ECU by
using the corresponding message identiﬁer. As a consequence,
each connected bus participant is able to start impersonation
attacks in order to inﬂuence vehicle functions without being
noticed. This has far-reaching consequences, especially if this
is possible without prior physical access.
This leads to the ﬁrst attacker model, the compromised
ECU. Some ECUs have wireless connections, such as WiFi,
Bluetooth or cellular, via which they can be attacked and
compromised by an attacker. If a vulnerability in a vehicle
model exists within an ECU which is accessible via the
internet, an attack can be launched on all vehicles of that
type. Such an intrusion into the system is possible without
prior physical access to the vehicle and remains hidden from
the vehicle or its passengers. The consequences are already
possible today and have been demonstrated such as inﬂuenc-
ing safety-critical vehicle functions [43], [62], [5]. Here, the
considered compromised ECU is known by EASI in advance.
Thus in a previous learning phase, a model was created based
on the signal characteristics of the corresponding ECU, which
can be used for its identiﬁcation. Attacks which require prior
physical access scale worse, which is why the detection of this
attack is the main goal of this work.
However, the assumption that the compromised ECU is
known by the system cannot always be guaranteed, as the
attack on the Jeep Cherokee shows [42]. This leads to the
second attack model, the unmonitored ECU. An ECU was used
for sending unauthorized CAN messages, which in its original
state was only designed as a passive, listening-only device.
Due to a vulnerability in the update mechanism, this ECU
could be reprogrammed and used to send forged messages.
Consequently, EASI does not have a model of the signal
characteristics in this attack scenario.
The third model, the additional ECU, is present when an
attacker connects a simple additional device to the monitored
bus in order to send manipulated messages. Among other
things, this is used to steal vehicles [29], to deactivate AdBlue
systems, to obscure defective airbags or for engine tuning [23],
[29]. If an attacker has physical access to a vehicle, additional
devices can be connected directly to the bus or with little effort
to the on-board diagnostics (OBD)-II port. The OBD-II port is
a standardized diagnostic interface located near the dashboard.
As mentioned, the main goal of the proposed system is
to detect remote attacks by determining the sender of received
messages. Therefore, we additionally consider a voltage-aware
attacker who is aware of the existence of the proposed system.
In order to bypass the system, an attacker can speciﬁcally try
to inﬂuence the signals of the compromised ECU in such a
