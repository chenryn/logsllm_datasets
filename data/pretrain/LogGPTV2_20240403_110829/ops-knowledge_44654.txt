User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Debugging Cisco 2621 Routers I've recently noticed problems with my 2621 router - it becomes unresponsive for about 10 minutes at a time, about 10 times a month.  The router sits inbetween the outside world and servers which I routinely log in to - strangely, I've noticed that if I'm logged into my servers during these 10 minute outages, I remain logged in with no slowdown in responsivity.  However, a ping from the server to the router hangs.

I'm not sure where to even being debugging the problem - I've enabled logging on the router but haven't noticed any messages which correlate strongly with the appearance of these events.  Any suggestions on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.

Assistant: Is there a correlation with High bandwidth usage when the router fails?  I've seen these older 2621s starting to hang at 25-30Mbit usage (Most of the time using a lot of processes in the CPU, slowly increasing to 99% and deeming the router unable to attend more processes, even pings).
