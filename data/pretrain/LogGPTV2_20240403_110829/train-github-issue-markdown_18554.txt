Firstly, thanks for such an awesome project!
When trying to add Javascript to customise onClick, Tooltips, etc. in the
deck.gl visualisations, the text box in which you enter the code text behaves
erratically. It is also unclear what is actually persisted onto the
visualisation, it doesn't appear to be the code as entered.
#### How to reproduce the bug
(I've given instructions for the deck.gl Scatterplot, but seems to apply to
all deck.gl visualisations)
  1. Go to Charts, Add new chart
  2. Select a dataset with spatial attributes, choose deck.gl Scatterplot, click on Create New Chart
  3. Configure Chart to display some data (i.e. configure the Lat-Long values)
  4. Under Data configuration pane on left of screen, expand the "Advanced" collapse. Attempt to enter text in the "Javascript Tooltip Generator". It should enter duplicate values.
  5. In the browser console, there should be `Uncaught TypeError: (validationErrors || []).forEach is not a function`
### Expected results
Text typed in the Javascipt fields in deck.gl visualisations to appear as
typed. For the code entered to be executed in the context of the
visualisation.
### Actual results
Text appearing in field does not match what was typed. Custom JS code doesn't
appear to be executed in map.
Following error appearing in browser console per character typing:

#### Screenshots
This is what appeared after typing a single `d` character:

This is after typing `d =>`:

### Environment
  * browser type and version: 
    * Mozilla Firefox 98.0 (64-bit)
    * Google Chrome Version 99.0.4844.51 (Official Build) (64-bit)
(built off `apache/superset:1.4.0` Docker image tag)
  * superset version: `1.4.0`
  * python version: `python 3.8.12`
  * node.js version: _sorry, not sure how to get the node version inside the running docker container_?
  * any feature flags active: 
    * `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING`
    * `ALERT_REPORTS`
    * `THUMBNAILS`
    * `LISTVIEWS_DEFAULT_CARD_VIEW`
    * `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS`
    * `ENABLE_JAVASCRIPT_CONTROLS` (in `tooltips` config section)
### Checklist
Make sure to follow these steps before submitting your issue - thank you!
  * I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
  * I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
  * I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.
### Additional context
I'm aware this functionality is fairly old (#4173), so I wonder if maybe a
subsequent change has broken the in-browser JS parsing?
