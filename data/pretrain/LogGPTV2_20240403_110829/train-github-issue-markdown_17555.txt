    Expected output:
    prog.go:4: s declared and not used
    But the compiler is silent.
    This is an implementation restriction, and a compiler may be free to restrict or not.
    That said, given the specification of the restriction, this is not consistent with the
    usage checks that gc already does.
    We may not be able to fix this since it may invalidate code that is now compiling.
