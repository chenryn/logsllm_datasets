ABSTRACT
A graphical password guiding image serves as a visual
prompt to improve password memorability. However, pass-
words may be easily guessed if the guiding image contains
hotspots, or commonly chosen (e.g., ‘clickable’) points that
are predictable via automated means.
In this paper, we
propose a method to determine graphical password guiding
image suitability in terms of potential password strength.
Our method uses image saliency to measure image suitabil-
ity; the higher the saliency, the more suitable the image.
Next, we evaluate the regions of interest (e.g., circles, faces,
corners, etc.) of suitable images to predict the strength of
resultant graphical passwords. We provide support for our
method in two ways: ﬁrst, we analyzed the guiding images
and resulting graphical password strength from an existing
dataset and secondly, we conducted our own user study to
measure the usability and memorability of the same guiding
images in terms of registration, login and recall times. We
found that the more visually salient the image, the stronger
the resulting graphical passwords in terms of entropy with
little or no eﬀect on usability and memorability. Further-
more, users tended to select more suitable images even when
given the choice of less suitable images. Thus, our approach
may be used to improve the strength of graphical passwords
before the user chooses a single point or action simply by
excluding unsuitable guiding images.

INTRODUCTION
Smartphones have become a fully-ﬂedged computing en-
vironment that many people depend upon. They are used
to store and access personal information such as medical
records, banking information, private email and text mes-
sages, even when they were deleted [15]. Many smartphones
use a soft keyboard, which makes typing passwords more
error prone compared to a traditional keyboard [2, 26]. In
addition, password composition rules are optimized for desk-
top keyboards since they require the use of special charac-
ters, which are more eﬀortful to type on a soft keyboard [17].
Since many smartphones owners use traditional text-based
passwords that are typed via soft keyboards, typing errors
and slow entry rate may negatively aﬀect the usability of tex-
tual passwords on these platforms [28] while creating easier
to type passwords may negatively aﬀect their strength.
Graphical passwords do not rely on traditional textual en-
try, instead depending on selecting a series of points on one
or more images. Despite the natural match between touch-
based mobile devices and graphical passwords, few mobile
manufacturers have used graphical passwords for authenti-
cation. One reason may be that click-based graphical pass-
words are prone to hotspots, which are frequently chosen
points on the image that draw the user’s visual attention.
Hotspots are chosen frequently because they are more mem-
orable than other click points, which makes the password
easier to remember [32], but also increase the likelihood that
a dictionary-based attack will succeed [32]. This is akin to
having knowledge of a target before attacking their textual
password; the attacker uses this knowledge to guess more
likely passwords ﬁrst. Advice by researchers with regards
to hotspots is to either choose images without hotspots or
to choose other, less likely points [5]. However, this advice
may lead to less memorable graphical passwords, which may
aﬀect usability and user adoption. Instead, we propose that
hotspots are a positive part of graphical passwords since an
image with many hotspots1 also has many possible pass-
words, and that this can be leveraged to create graphical
passwords that are both strong and memorable.
In this paper we present a method for improving the
strength of graphical passwords while taking advantage of
the memorability of visually salient regions. Our approach,
1We use the term hotspot here to conform to the terminology
commonly used in graphical password research, as it gener-
ally refers to points on an image that are frequently chosen in
graphical passwords. We make a distinction between a fre-
quently chosen point (hotspot) and a visually salient point
(RoI) since the latter may or may not be selected frequently.

which begins with measuring the visual saliency of the image
and then maps the salient regions to objects that appear in
the guiding image, has the potential to remove images that
do not contain enough salient regions to make dictionary-
based attacks less successful. By allowing users to choose
guiding images that are suﬃciently complex, we improve
password strength before the user makes a single click. We
tested our method on thousands of graphical passwords from
the dataset by Zhao et al. [37] and found a strong positive
correlation between image saliency, number and type of re-
gions of interest and the resultant theoretical and practical
password spaces. We supported this result by conducting a
user study that used the same guiding images as Zhao et al.
to study the usability and memorability aspects. Our results
showed that participants found the speed and ease of using
a graphical password acceptable, and that most participants
were able to remember their graphical password over time.
Finally, we found that the chosen click points were spread
over the detected regions of interest, showing that practical
password space is not dramatically reduced when user choice
is taken into account.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 Effect of Image Content on User Pass-
word Selection
Prediction resistance is a key trait for graphical password
security. Selecting an image with predictable hotspots may
result in passwords that are easily guessed via dictionary
attacks. Stobert et al. [30] studied the eﬀect of guiding im-
ages on the frequency of creating the same pattern of pass-
words. They found that users tend to follow patterns when
creating graphical passwords, whether using a blank back-
ground or guiding image, and that these patterns tended
to result in weaker passwords. Davis et al. [9] used face
and story schemes to study the impact of images on user
choice. They found that faces, particularly those of the
same race and/or gender as the user, were more appealing.
Their results also agree with those of Stobert et al.: users
in their study followed predictable patterns when creating
their graphical passwords.
Dunphy and Yan [12] explored the impact of using a back-
ground image on the security of Draw-A-Secret graphical
passwords. Their results were that users who were shown
background images created more complex and more mem-
orable passwords than those who were not shown back-
ground images. Moreover, background images participated
in reducing the probability of creating predictable passwords
that followed known patterns. Similarly, Goloﬁt [16] found
that images containing recognizable places are the most fre-
quently selected areas when creating graphical passwords.
These results show that the guiding image has an eﬀect on
the areas of the image selected when users create graphical
passwords
2.2 Hotspot Detection
Avoiding hotspots may limit graphical password pre-
dictability [7, 8, 32]. Consequently, implementations have
been proposed to encourage users to avoid hotspots when
creating graphical passwords. Chaisson et al. [7] introduced
Persuasive Cued Click Points (PCCP), an implementation
that guided users to click within randomly chosen regions
determined by the system rather than on hotspots. The
results indicated that this approach helped users to create
less guessable graphical passwords, but they did not exam-
ine whether the total number of passwords in hotspot-heavy
images was suﬃcient to make this guessing attack viable.
PCCP takes advantage of less frequently chosen visually
salient regions in some cases, similar to the intuition that
guides our work, although we extend this work to show that
increasing visually salient features is a positive aspect for
graphical passwords in terms of resultant password strength.
Several methods have been proposed to detect image
hotspots. Salehi-Abari et al. [27] used the Itti algorithm [20]
as a bottom-up visual attention method to explore the guess-
ability of graphical passwords. The experiment studied
whether users’ choice of click points that fall inside detected
regions are predictable. Their results indicated that some
patterns of graphical passwords, such as diagonal lines, were
predicted with reasonable accuracy. van Oorschot et al. [33]
built a dictionary attack using the Itti visual attention al-
gorithm. The result introduced a signiﬁcant improvement,
compared to [32], for purely automated guessing click-based
graphical passwords. The dictionary diagonal lines found
over 48% of user passwords for each of the two images used.
Objects that appear in guiding images, such as faces, lines
and circles, can be related to the position and prevalence of
hotspots. Mayron compared the performance of three diﬀer-
ent visual attention models, Itti-Koch-Niebur, Graph-Based
Visual Saliency (GBVS), and Image Signature to detect the
most salient image regions [21]. The result was that these vi-
sual attention methods produced good results for detecting
objects in images, but Itti-Koch-Neibur and GBVS models
performed the best. Mayron and Alshehri evaluated these
three models of visual attention to predict the click points
used when creating graphical passwords [22]. Their results
indicated that, in general, GBVS had the best performance
towards predicting graphical passwords.
We believe that hotspots are a beneﬁt to the strength
and memorability of graphical passwords provided they are
available in suﬃcient numbers that a dictionary attack is
infeasible.
2.3 Measuring Guiding Image Suitability
Image complexity as it applies to graphical passwords is an
active research area. Schaub et al. [29] explored the design
space of graphical passwords on smartphones. They calcu-
lated the minimum password length required by each scheme
to achieve 14 bit (equivalent to strength of four-digit PIN)
and 42 bit (equivalent to strength of seven-character tex-
tual password) strength under the assumption of equiprob-
able password distribution. Their results showed that the
studied graphical password implementations required fewer
clicks than entering a PIN of comparable strength.
Dirik et al. [11] created a model to measure the suitability
of background image for the PassPoints graphical password
system. They used the color feature to compute the suitabil-
ity of both complex and simple images. The results indicated
that, depending on the model, a dictionary attack was able
to predict about 80% of the click points of the simple images
and about 70% of click points for the complex images. More-
over, the resultant password entropy was higher in complex
compared to simple images, which may aid users in selecting
the most appropriate image to use in authentication.
Our work expands that of Dirik et al. [11] in several ways.
First, we begin with a simple method for determining the
128
least suitable images in a set and remove those before mov-
ing onto a more complex method that takes into account the
objects that appear in the guiding image. This ﬁrst pass sim-
ply and easily removes the images that are more likely to be
used to create weaker graphical passwords; by not showing
these to users we improve the strength of resulting pass-
words with very little eﬀort. We then use diﬀerent features
for assessing images when compared to Dirik et al.: we use
image objects such as circles, lines and faces, where Dirik et
al. combined color contrast, luminosity contrast and fore-
ground versus background objects into a focus of attention
map. While Dirik et al. rightly limit the number of features
they use in their attention map, there are other features that
may be considered such as the size of objects, shape, and ob-
ject category; we therefore extend their work by considering
features beyond those they used and determining their eﬀect
on the resultant password’s entropy. We also extend their
work by considering several more images (15 as opposed to
their 2) and use two sets of data to conﬁrm our model and
results: the dataset of Zhao et al. [37], which has over 10,000
passwords from 800 subjects and our own user study dataset
with 33 users and 33 passwords. We consider both theoret-
ical and practical password spaces rather than just theoret-
ical. Theoretical password space is the upper bound on the
number of possible passwords given a length and a set of
possible password click points; it is often an overly generous
value that does not take into account user choice. Practical
password space (also called eﬀective password space), on the
other hand, takes into account the idea that users will prefer
certain click points over others and adjusts the calculation
of the possible number of passwords accordingly. Finally,
we also consider usability and memorability in addition to
password strength since strong passwords have been known
to suﬀer from usability and memorability issues that have
limited their adoption [28, 36].
Zhao et al. [37] identiﬁed positions of interest for a set of
images based on observing user behavior. They determined
the positions of interest by and algorithms to detect image
objects, then created a list of generated points. The experi-
ment indicated that faces were the most selected regions for
about 60.3% of the passwords’ actions that were created on
the images.
In our work, we extended Zhao et al.’s work
by considering other regions of interest such as the image
corners. Moreover, we considered the diversity of regions of
interest. We generated a list of ﬁxed-size (19x19) of regions
of interest instead of speciﬁc points. These regions were
prioritized based on the likelihood to be chosen. Our work
generated a model that can be used to evaluate the suitabil-
ity of an image for graphical passwords given the number
of regions of interest and their types. This model will sim-
plify the process of choosing an image that may improve the
strength of graphical passwords.
2.4 Measuring Password Strength
Theoretical password space is used to measure password
strength, including that of graphical passwords.
In text-
based passwords, the character set from which users select
and the minimum password length are two factors that in-
ﬂuence password strength. Several types of measures have
been proposed, including entropy checkers [24] and compar-
isons to dictionary or other word lists [10]. Such measure-
ments have been extended to graphical passwords, where the
set of characters is equivalent to the set of click points, and
password length is equivalent to the number of click points
chosen [29, 31].
A strength measurement for recognition-based graphical
passwords has been proposed that considers attacks such as
guessability, observability, and recordability [13]. A score is
computed that represents the security level of the system in
terms of resisting the attack. This model does not consider
password strength; instead, it measures the strength of the
system.
Our work builds upon existing research by taking advan-
tage of image saliency as it relates to hotspots to deter-
mine whether there is a relationship between image saliency
and both the theoretical and practical password spaces. We
use this relationship to remove those images with the least
amount of saliency (and thus likely having the smallest the-
oretical password space) as guiding images to encourage
stronger passwords without additional user eﬀort.
Our contribution is to provide an approach to selecting
suitable images for use with graphical passwords that con-
siders the practical (not theoretical) password space. We
show that the practical password space of complex images
is higher than for less complex images, and thus we recom-
mend that users and developers take advantage of images
with many hotspots rather than avoiding them.
3. OUR APPROACH
We present a two–stage approach to measuring graphi-
cal password guiding image suitability designed to increase
graphical password strength. Stage 1 measures guiding im-
age suitability based on the salient regions as detected by
the GBVS algorithm [18, 19]. The salient regions serve as
input to entropy calculations, which are used to measure the
theoretical and practical password space for the image. We
then relate saliency to image suitability, and propose a de-
cision model that can be used to exclude unsuitable guiding
images. Once we have excluded the least suitable images,
we further examine what objects in the image comprise the
salient regions in Stage 2 of our approach. We detect objects
by segmenting the image into regions of 19x19 pixels, which
are then labeled with detected object types including faces,
circles, and generic objects. We then compute the likelihood
that a user will select the detected region, and then use this
likelihood to compute the entropy of the resulting passwords.
We evaluate our model using real graphical passwords cho-
sen by users in a study by Zhao et al. [37], and also with the
results of a user study designed to test memorability and
usability.
