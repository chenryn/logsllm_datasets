???
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.6.0 (skipped_false 39251fc27b) last updated 2018/02/10 00:32:41 (GMT +200)
      config file = None

##### CONFIGURATION
Default
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Arch linux latest, tasks run against localhost
##### SUMMARY
It is not possible to define task vars from a dict variable
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
    - hosts: localhost
      tasks:
        - set_fact:
            dict: {'key': 'value'}
        - debug:
            msg: Test
          vars: "{{ dict }}"
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
The second task should be executed successfully and the dict's contents should
become available as variables in the context of the task.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
    ERROR! Vars in a Task must be specified as a dictionary, or a list of dictionaries
    The error appears to have been in '/home/nikos/Projects/playbook.yml': line 8, column 9, but may
    be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.
    The offending line appears to be:
          vars:
            - dict
