VPN (Virtual Private Network) remote access: VPN can establish a virtual dedicated channel, through encryption technology, to ensure the connectivity and security of remote access. 2. Remote desktop: Employees can connect to the company server through remote desktop to work, and remote desktop can realize the control and monitoring of remote computers. 3. Tunnel: Tunnel is another effective remote access method to provide employees with secure remote access services. The tunnel can realize the connection between two networks when the security tunnel is opened, so as to provide high-speed remote access service. 4. Cloud storage: Enterprises can use cloud storage to store employees' documents and data. Employees can connect to cloud storage through the Internet at any location and remotely access their own documents and data. 5.
