User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Do SQL backups run faster if you set the databases to read only first? I have to do a backup of all databases back to back (3.25 GB of data for all .BAK files combined).

Will it go faster if I configure the script to set the database to read only first before backing it up?

I am using the RESTORE VERIFYONLY option to check the integrity of the backup. I'd also like to know if there is anything that can speed that process up? I found that takes longer than the actual backup does!

Assistant: Setting it to READ ONLY might help you in so far as you are removing one drop of water out of an ocean.

Backups take into account active transactions, during the time that the backup is being taken.
This means that yes, when you put your database into READ ONLY you are removing a tiny bit of overhead.
Which technically does help, but it really isn't worth it.

Improving the performance of backups is well known territory.
There are plenty of blog posts and even a tech-net article about how to improve the performance of your backups. None of those mention read only because honestly you won't notice any difference.

To improve your backups performance:  


Use multiple media or devices
Research optimization options for your specific type of backup.
Full and differential backups have different optimizations than Log backups, and yet different optimizations than restoring your backup.
Improve read performance on your origin platform
Improve write performance on your destination platform


So to recap:
Yes it helps, but not enough to be measurable by a sane human being.
There are ways to improve backup performance, try looking into those.
