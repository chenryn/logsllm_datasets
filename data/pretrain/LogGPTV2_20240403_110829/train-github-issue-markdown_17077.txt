After upgrading to version `0.19.9`, the Elastisch test suite, which resets indexes by specifying the index name as `_all`, has started to fail. Elasticsearch now responds with a 404 error, indicating that the specified index is missing:

```bash
curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/_all?pretty=true'
{
  "error" : "IndexMissingException[[_all] missing]",
  "status" : 404
}
```

It is unclear whether this change was intentional, but it appears that `_all` should no longer be treated as a regular index name. Additionally, the `action.disable_delete_all_indices` setting is not configured in my current setup.
