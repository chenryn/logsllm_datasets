After upgrading to `0.19.9`, Elastisch test suite that resets indexes by
specifying index name as `_all` now fails. ElasticSearch responds with 404s:
    curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/_all?pretty=true'
    {
      "error" : "IndexMissingException[[_all] missing]",
      "status" : 404
    }
I am not sure if this change is intentional but looks like `_all` should not
be treated as a regular index name. `action.disable_delete_all_indices` is not
set in my config.
