 and, without loss of 
generality,  let  mp>mp–1  for  each  p∈[2,h+r].  The  number 
system  representing  integers  in  [0,M)  with  the  (h+r)-
tuples  of  their  residues  modulo  m1,…,mh+r  is  called  the 
Redundant  Residue  Number  System  (RRNS)  of  moduli 
m1,…,mh+r,  range  M  and  redundancy  MR  [22].  Although 
the  given  RRNS  could  provide  representations  to  all 
integers  in  the  range  [0,M·MR),  the  legitimate  range  of 
representation  is limited to  [0,M),  and the  corresponding 
h+r-tuples,  are  called  legitimate.  Integers  in  [M,M·MR)
and the corresponding (h+r)-tuples are called illegitimate.
Given an RRNS of range M and redundancy MR, where 
(m1,…,mh,mh+1,…,mh+r) is the h+r-tuple of the moduli and 
let  (x1,…,xh,xh+1,…,xh+r)  be  the  legitimate  representation 
of  some  X  in  [0,M).  An  event  making  unavailable  d
arbitrary  digits  in the  representation  is  called  an  erasure
of multiplicity d. Let {x′1,  x′2, …, x′h+r–d}⊆{x1,…,xh+r} be 
the  available  digits  and  {m′1,  m′2, …, m′h+r–d}⊆{m1, …,
mh+r}  the  corresponding  moduli.  If  d≤r,  the  RNS  of 
moduli 
range 
  and,  since  X<M,  (x′1, x′2, …,
M
x′h+r–d) is the unique representation of X in the latter RNS.

It is known that the RRNS under consideration has the 
ability to detect any error up to multiplicity r: in fact any 
integer 
erroneous 
representation  is  illegitimate  [20,22].  It  is  also  known 
[20,22] that the given RRNS has the ability to correct any 
error up to multiplicity  (cid:172) (cid:188)2
. In fact, consider an error of

Efficient  error  correcting  algorithms  are  reported  in 
[23-25].  
The  following 
theorems  combine 
the  preceding 
results. 
Theorem 1. If s+d≤r, the RRNS of moduli m1,…,mh+r
detects erasures up to multiplicity s combined with errors 
of  multiplicity  d  affecting  the  available  digits  after 
erasure. 
Proof. Let (x1,…,xh+r) be the legitimate representation 
of some X in [0,M), {x′1,…,x′h+r–s} be the available digits 
in  the  representation  after  erasure,  and  let  {m′1,…,m′h+r–
s}⊆{m1,…,mh+r}  be  the  corresponding  moduli.  Then 
(x′1,…,x′h+r–s)  is  the legitimate  representation  of  X  in  the 
RRNS  of  moduli  m′1,…,m′h+r′,  with  r′=r–s≥d.  From  the 
above recollected properties, this  RRNS detects errors up 
to multiplicity r′ ≥d.
Theorem 2. If s+2d≤r, the RRNS of moduli m1,…,mh+r
corrects erasures up to multiplicity s combined with errors 
of  multiplicity  d  affecting  the  available  digits  after 
erasure. 
(cid:134)
Proof. Let (x1,…,xh+r) be the legitimate representation 
of some X in [0,M), {x′1,…,x′h+r–s} be the available digits 
in  the  representation  after  erasure,  and  let  {m′1,…,m′h+r–
s}⊆{m1,…,mh+r}  be  the  corresponding  moduli.  Then 
(x′1,…,x′h+r–s)  is  the legitimate  representation  of  X  in  the 
RRNS  of  moduli  m′1,…,m′h+r′,  with  r′=r–s≥2d.  From  the

4.  File Management 
The  mobiles  cooperate  by  creating  and  sharing  files, 
and the system provides procedures for the users to create, 
share  and  access  the  files.  In  this  paper  we  focus  on  a 
write-once  model;  that  is,  the  shared  files  cannot  be 
modified  once  written,  but  they  can  be  accessed  for 
reading by authorized mobiles. Once created, the file can
