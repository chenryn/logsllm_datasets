User: I am in the process of building a Google App Engine application which requires audio to be recorded and saved in our database. I have found no alternative to using some form of RTMP server for recording audio through flash, so [rtmplite] (http://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/) came into our horizon.
Since I have no experience with rtmplite, is it the right choice for our project? Or is there any other Python-based RTMP solution that allows audio recording? Any flash client you can recommend?
Thanks!
Assistant: Try appengine backends, they currently don't whitelist a lot of things required for such streaming. But they might soon do so. Once they enable sockets, then rtmplite or rtmpy could easily be ported to run there. Backends already support unlimited request length which is required for streaming.
