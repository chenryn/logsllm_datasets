Abstract—Long Term Evolution (LTE/4G) establishes mutual
authentication with a provably secure Authentication and Key
Agreement (AKA) protocol on layer three of the network stack.
Permanent integrity protection of the control plane safeguards
the trafﬁc against manipulations. However, missing integrity pro-
tection of the user plane still allows an adversary to manipulate
and redirect IP packets, as recently demonstrated.
In this work, we introduce a novel cross-layer attack that
exploits the existing vulnerability on layer two and extends it
with an attack mechanism on layer three. More precisely, we take
advantage of the default IP stack behavior of operating systems
and show that combining it with the layer-two vulnerability allows
an active attacker to impersonate a user towards the network
and vice versa; we name these attacks IMP4GT (IMPersonation
attacks in 4G neTworks). In contrast to a simple redirection
attack as demonstrated in prior work, our attack dramatically
extends the possible attack scenarios and thus emphasizes the
need for user-plane integrity protection in mobile communication
standards. The results of our work imply that providers can no
longer rely on mutual authentication for billing, access control,
and legal prosecution. On the other hand, users are exposed
to any incoming IP connection as an adversary can bypass
the provider’s ﬁrewall. To demonstrate the practical impact of
our attack, we conduct two IMP4GT attack variants in a live,
commercial network, which—for the ﬁrst time—completely break
the mutual authentication aim of LTE on the user plane in a real-
world setting.

INTRODUCTION
Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest widely deployed
mobile communication standard and is used by hundreds of
millions of people worldwide. The protocol offers high-speed
Internet access and packet-based telephony services and has
become an integral component of our daily communication.
We fundamentally rely on the security of LTE for a variety of
applications. The security goals of LTE include, amongst oth-
ers, mutual authentication, trafﬁc conﬁdentiality, and location
privacy; any attack vector undermining these security aims has
far-reaching implications to the use of LTE as a communication
medium.
In the context of mobile communication, mutual authenti-
cation is an important security aim since it ensures that both
communication parties (i. e., the user equipment and the net-
work) mutually verify their identities. As the wireless medium
is accessible for everyone in the vicinity and identiﬁers can

be easily forged, mutual authentication is essential for build-
ing trust between communication parties. Telecommunication
providers rely on user authentication for accounting, authoriza-
tion, and the association of data sessions to a legal person. The
latter case is of particular importance in prosecution, in which
a possible offender is accused of committing a crime via a
mobile Internet connection. Additionally, users rely on network
authentication for the conﬁdentiality of their communication.
One important example for missing network authentication is
the second mobile network generation GSM (Global System
for Mobile Communications): by faking the identity of a
legitimate network, an attacker can impersonate the network
in GSM and eavesdrop on the communication of the victim.
In contrast to earlier network generations, LTE establishes
mutual authentication on layer three of the network stack
using a provably secure Authentication and Key Agreement
(AKA) protocol [6], [8]. Based on this protocol, subsequent
encryption ensures the conﬁdentiality of user and control data.
Permanent integrity protection, however, is only applied to the
control data. A recent study has revealed that missing integrity
protection of the user plane on layer two allows to manipulate
user data in a deterministic way [40]. More speciﬁcally, a
layer-two attacker in a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position
between the phone and the network can introduce undetectable
bit ﬂips due to malleable encryption and redirect trafﬁc to an-
other destination. While this attack demonstrates the potential
consequences of trafﬁc manipulation, it is solely limited to
redirecting trafﬁc to another destination.
In this work, we introduce a novel cross-layer attack
concept that complements the known layer-two vulnerability
(i. e., missing integrity protection on the user plane [40])
with exploiting the default IP stack behavior of operating
systems on layer three. More precisely, we make use of the
reﬂection mechanism of certain IP packets, which allows us
to not only redirect user-plane trafﬁc, but also to create an
encryption and decryption oracle that enables an adversary to
perform a full impersonation of the phone or network on the
user plane. We call this concept IMP4GT (IMPersonation in
4G neTworks, pronounced [ĲIm­pæk(t)]). IMP4GT completely
breaks the mutual authentication property for the user plane
on layer three, as an attacker can send and receive arbitrary IP
packets despite any encryption.
This attack has far-reaching consequences for providers and
users. Providers can no longer assume that an IP connection
originates from the user. Billing mechanisms can be triggered
by an adversary, causing the exhaustion of data limits, and any
access control or the providers’ ﬁrewall can be bypassed. A
possible impersonation also has consequences for legal pros-
ecution, as an attacker can establish arbitrary IP connections
associated with the victim’s identity.
IMP4GT can be deployed in two variants: i) In the uplink
impersonation variant,
the attacker acts as a user towards
the network; this variant can be used to establish a TCP/IP
connection towards the Internet that is associated with the
victim’s identity. ii) In the downlink variant, the attacker im-
personates the network and can establish a TCP/IP connection
towards the phone. In doing so, the attacker circumvents the
provider’s ﬁrewall and can potentially use this connection
for malware deployment or data exﬁltration. In contrast to
the layer-two redirection presented in earlier work, IMP4GT
allows the attacker to not only manipulate the content of a
connection, but adds substantially more degrees of freedom
(e. g., establishing arbitrary network connections) to possible
attack scenarios.
We are the ﬁrst
to combine the known layer-two vul-
nerability with a layer-three attack to extend the adversary’s
capabilities. This broader view on the problem of missing
integrity protection leads to the discovery of new vulnera-
bilities that allow a full impersonation attack. In a series of
empirical experiments, we provide a comprehensive view of
the problem statement and explain the characteristics we make
use of for IMP4GT. Furthermore, we show the real-world
applicability of the uplink and downlink attacks in an actual
commercial network. To this end, we demonstrate how an
attacker can access a service site that should only be accessible
for the victim and how an attacker can bypass the provider’s
ﬁrewall. The feasibility of such an impersonation reveals that
the dimension of missing integrity protection is more far-
reaching than previously assumed. We describe the analysis
in a step-by-step manner for the uplink and downlink variants
of IMP4GT. By performing the analysis and demonstrating the
attack, we also aim at inﬂuencing the current 5G speciﬁcation
to mandate user plane integrity. In summary, we make the
following three contributions:
• We introduce IMP4GT, an attack that exploits the missing
integrity protection on layer two along with standard IP
stack behavior on layer three. This cross-layer approach
aggravates a prior redirection attack with the ability to
perform a full impersonation on the user plane in both
uplink and downlink direction.
• We provide a comprehensive series of experiments that
enable us to understand the network characteristics we
exploit for the IMP4GT attacks. In particular, we analyze
the default IP stack behavior for two types of reﬂections,
which allows us to build the encryption and decryption
oracle for the impersonation attack.
• Finally, we successfully demonstrate full end-to-end im-
plementations of the uplink and downlink variants of
IMP4GT with a mobile phone in a commercial network.
Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our attack
for the current and upcoming mobile generations for both
users and providers.
Responsible Disclosure. Following the guidelines of respon-
sible disclosure, we informed providers and vendors about
our ﬁndings through the GSMA’s coordinated vulnerability
disclosure program [18]. By that, we hope to inﬂuence the
LTE and 5G speciﬁcations to add full rate, mandatory integrity
protection.

II. PRELIMINARIES
We ﬁrst provide an overview of the LTE network and rel-
evant protocols, including the LTE protocol stack. Afterward,
we introduce the security establishment in LTE and the IP
stack’s reﬂection mechanisms.
A. LTE Network
An LTE network comprises the User Equipments (UEs),
the Evolved NodeBs (eNodeBs), and the Evolved Packet Core
(EPC) network, which in turn consists of different entities
(cf. Figure 1). In the following, we brieﬂy introduce these
network entities.
UE. The User Equipment (UE) is the user’s communication
device, such as a smartphone. It contains a SIM card that
stores a shared key along with the permanent identity called
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). Furthermore,
the UE consists of a modem that communicates with the
network and thus abstracts the communication for an operating
system. On top of that, the operating system implements the
IP protocol along with transport-layer protocols, e. g., TCP or
UDP, for applications.
eNodeB. The base stations in LTE are called eNodeBs. They
manage the radio resources and encrypt and decrypt the user
data. Usually, the UE selects the eNodeB with the highest
signal strength. Fake base stations exploit this behavior to lure
a victim into their cell [41]. In this work, we assume a MitM
attacker with similar capabilities as a fake base station.
EPC. The LTE core network, called EPC, consists of multiple
components. The Mobility Management Entity (MME) is re-
sponsible for the mobility management and user authentication.
The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) stores the shared key and
generates an authentication vector when the authentication is
established. The Serving Gateway (S-GW) and Packet Data
Network Gateway (P-GW) forward the user data to and from
the Packet Data Network (PDN) and are responsible for
accounting, authorization, and lawful interception. In most of
the cases, the PDN is the Internet. It is also possible to connect
private IP networks as PDN, e. g., company networks.
Most mobile network providers implement
IPv4 and
IPv6 [26]. In the case of IPv4, providers use Network Address
Translation (NAT) at the P-GW to allocate an internal IP
address for the UE [21]. For Internet communication,
the
P-GW maps the internal IP address to a public IP address. With
the help of NAT, incoming packets are ﬁltered in cases where
the connection was not established from the internal network.
For IPv6, a ﬁrewall at
the P-GW protects the user from
incoming trafﬁc. Later on, we will show how the downlink
variant of IMP4GT allows an adversary to circumvent the
security mechanisms of the NAT gateway and ﬁrewall.

sequence number. The random nonce serves as a challenge for
the UE and is used to derive session keys. The UE calculates
a response and sends it back to the MME. The random nonce
with the shared key is used by the MME and the UE to
derive a session key, based on which the NAS and the RRC
layer derives temporary key material for the ongoing security
mechanisms. The EPC and eNodeB activate the security in the
NAS and PDCP protocols with a security mode command and
thus deﬁne the used security algorithms.
In LTE, the security algorithms for encryption and integrity
protection are based on three basic ciphers: Snow3G, AES, and
ZUC. Snow3G and ZUC are stream ciphers, while AES is a
block cipher. The ciphers are used in a mode of operation
for performing either integrity protection or encryption. For
integrity protection, a Cipher Block Chaining Message Au-
thentication Code (CBC-MAC) is calculated over the message
and appended. For encryption, the ciphertext is computed by
xor-ing the plaintext with a keystream. If the underlying cipher
is already a stream cipher (i. e., Snow3G or ZUC), no further
processing is required. In case of a block cipher (AES), the
algorithm is turned into a stream cipher with counter mode.
Each PDCP frame is encrypted with a separate keystream that
is realized by increasing a counter as an input parameter for
the cipher.
An active attacker can introduce bit ﬂips to the ciphertext
that are inherited to the plaintext—called malleable encryption.
The ALTER attack [40] exploits the malleable encryption of
user data in LTE for a DNS spooﬁng attack, where the targeted
manipulation of DNS requests allows to manipulate the desti-
nation IP address of DNS requests. For the IMP4GT attacks, we
apply the ALTER DNS spooﬁng as one of the building blocks
of our attack to establish a cryptographic oracle. In addition to
the previously introduced trafﬁc redirection, an adversary can
impersonate a user towards the network and vice versa.
D. Unreachable and Ping Reﬂection
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) maintains
an IP connection by exchanging additional information or error
messages. How systems support and handle ICMP and other
protocol messages is deﬁned by the stack implementation of
the operating system. Part of this protocol is the reﬂection of
messages, a mechanism which we exploit in our attack. In
the following, we introduce two relevant reﬂection types and
document their limitations for our attack scenario.
