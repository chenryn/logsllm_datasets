# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

The current list of implemented keybindings lacks the option to move tabs to the left or right using keyboard shortcuts. I have searched for this feature in other places, but the closest I found was Pull Request #3478, which implements this functionality via mouse input (drag and drop). However, it appears that the corresponding keyboard shortcuts are still missing.

I also came across a mention of this feature in another discussion thread, but it was unclear whether it was just a proposed request or if it had been implemented.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

Implementing this feature should be straightforward. The following steps can be taken:

1. Add the keywords `moveTabLeft` and `moveTabRight` to the list of supported keybindings.
2. Ensure that these new keybindings are properly integrated into the existing keybinding system.
3. Test the new keybindings to ensure they function as expected, allowing users to move tabs to the left or right using the keyboard.
