# Description of the new feature/enhancement
The list of implemented keybindings is missing the option of moving tabs to
the left/right.
I did try and look for this request in other places, but the closest I could
find was PR #3478, which implements this functionality as mouse-input by drag
& drop, but as far as I could tell it is still missing as keyboard shortcuts.
I saw this mentioned in another thread, but again I was not able to tell if
this was just proposed as a request or actually solved.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
This should be straightforward: Get the keywords `moveTabLeft` and
`moveTabRight` in to the list of supported keybindings.
