## Expected Behavior
LinearProgress and CircularProgress should accept min, max and value props.  
When mode is 'determinate', the progress is calculated based on value between
a scale of min to max.  
If min and max are not supplied, they default to 0 and 100 respectively
(original behavior).  
`inlineStyles.primary.transform = 'scaleX(' + ((value - min) / (max - min)) +
')';`
## Current Behavior
LinearProgress and CircularProgress accepts value prop.  
When mode is 'determinate', the progress is calculated based on value between
a scale of 0 to 100.  
`inlineStyles.primary.transform = 'scaleX(' + value / 100 + ')';`
## Context
This would simplify components that utilize LinearProgress and
CircularProgress as parent components would no longer be responsible for
scaling values between 0 and 100. I find it's pretty rare to have data already
suitable for the progress components because it's not normally between 0 and
100.
