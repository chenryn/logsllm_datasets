As noted in #12076 Getpagesize doesn't currently return the actual system's
default page size, but rather a hard-coded value. Per the discussion with
@ianlancetaylor on golang-dev [1], the opinion was that syscall.Getpagesize
should return the same value as the POSIX call sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE).
This change will be necessary for future platform support on Solaris.
While this change could be generally applied (more than likely) to all other
POSIX platforms, I'm only planning on making this change for Solaris for now.
This issue is being filed to track the change against golang/go separately
from x/sys/unix.
While it may be viewed as related to #10180, I believe it can be resolved
independently.
