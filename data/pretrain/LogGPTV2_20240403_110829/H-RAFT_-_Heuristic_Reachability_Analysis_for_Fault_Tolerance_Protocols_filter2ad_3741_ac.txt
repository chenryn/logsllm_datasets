### 3.2. Experiment: Depth and Width Restrictions

The first line in the table indicates the width restriction, while the second line describes \( df(\text{depth}(si)) \). In the table, depth is denoted by \( d \).

The results for this experiment are consistent with those from Experiment 3.1. For the FlexRay model, no fault tolerance violations were detected. For the pendulum protocol, an improvement was observed only for the smallest width of 100 global states per front when using depth factors \( df \neq 0 \). The number of transitions executed until a fault tolerance violation was detected decreased by 13%.

For all non-zero depth factors, no significant differences in the results were observed. The number of transitions executed for each width remained the same for the pendulum protocol model.

### 3.3. Experiment: Restriction of Spontaneous Transitions in Faulty Components

In Section 2.2, we discussed decreasing weights for spontaneous transitions in faulty components (Equation 7). This restriction is evaluated for the FlexRay model only. The pendulum protocol model is implemented such that each spontaneous transition within the faulty process fires exactly once, so no benefit can be expected from applying this restriction.

The fourth and fifth columns of Table 2 contain the results for decrease factors \( nDec \) of 0.5 and 0.1. The last column, labeled "0.1 SCO," shows the results of Experiment 3.4, which will be discussed later.

When no decrease factor is applied (\( nDec = 1.0 \)), no fault tolerance violations were detected. However, with \( nDec = 0.5 \) and \( nDec = 0.1 \), several cases of fault tolerance violations were observed. These results support the conclusion that reducing the number of times the same spontaneous transition fires in a faulty process improves the detection of fault tolerance violations.

| Model | nDec | Width, Depthâ†“ | 100, 1.0 | 250, 1.0 | 500, 1.0 | 750, 1.0 | 1000, 1.0 |
|-------|------|---------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| FlexRay | 0.5 | 100, d(si) | 5811 | 9689 | 111300 | 209440 | 1346403* |
| FlexRay | 0.1 | 100, 0.01d(si) | 3884 | 9695 | 2683 | 2096 | 112528 |
| Pendulum | 0.1 SCO | 100, d(si) | 3871 | 9238 | 58642* | 199073 | 2849 2026879* 212028* |

These results also confirm the previous finding that a smaller width leads to better performance. The best results were obtained with a depth factor \( df(d(si)) = 0.01 \cdot d(si) \). Out of the 10 scenarios with this factor, 7 yielded paths to a fault tolerance violation. The differences between \( nDec = 0.5 \) and \( nDec = 0.1 \) were marginal, with seven and eight violation paths, respectively.

### 3.4. Experiment: Elimination of Signal-Consumption-Only Transitions

This experiment focuses on the benefits of eliminating transitions that do not contribute to the progress of the reachability analysis (Section 2.2, last paragraph). The setup is the same as in Section 3.3, but we only consider a decrease factor of \( nDec = 0.1 \). The 20 scenarios are re-evaluated, this time excluding signal-consumption-only transitions. The results are included in Table 2, column "0.1 SCO."

Again, the experiment confirms that smaller widths should be preferred. In four cases, the elimination of signal-consumption-only transitions led to the discovery of paths resulting in fault tolerance violations, whereas the algorithm without elimination did not find such paths. Conversely, in three cases, violation paths were found without elimination but not with it. The performance of the algorithm ignoring signal-consumption-only transitions is independent of the depth function.

The four cases where better results were achieved with the execution of signal-consumption-only transitions can be attributed to the fact that these transitions lead to immediate reconvergence after their execution. Without elimination, the front of the reachability graph (restricted to some width) may contain these transitions, effectively shrinking the width restriction as fewer other transitions can be included in the front. As observed in previous experiments, smaller widths are beneficial.

Elimination of signal-consumption-only transitions in conjunction with the application of transition input weights will be discussed in Section 3.6.

### 3.5. Experiment: Transition Input Weights

This section presents experiments evaluating different transition input weights (Section 2.2). These static weights were chosen to be large enough to exhibit significantly different consequences.

For this experiment, the width restriction is set to 100 global states per front, and the depth factor \( df \) is zero. The decrease factor \( nDec \) is set to 0.1. Signal-consumption-only transitions are permitted.

For each of the static weights of the 7 input elements, five values are considered: zero (w = 0) and four different weights (w1 to w4) greater than zero: \( w_0 < w_1 < w_2 < w_3 < w_4 \). Thus, the maximum number of experimental runs is \( 5^7 = 78120 \).

In the first step, the complete set of runs is performed for the pendulum protocol. The results are analyzed and then applied to the FlexRay model to substantiate the generality of our approach.

Since the pendulum protocol model does not contain timer arrays or signals without parameters, the number of required runs is reduced to \( 5^5 = 3125 \). However, the complete results table cannot be included here due to its size.
