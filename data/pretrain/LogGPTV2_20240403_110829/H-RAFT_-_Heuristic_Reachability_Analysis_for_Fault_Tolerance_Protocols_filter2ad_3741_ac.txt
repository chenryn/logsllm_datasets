df(depth(si)). In the table, depth is denoted by d.
Basically, the results did not change w.r.t. experiment
3.1. For the FlexRay model, still no fault tolerance violation
could be found. For the pendulum protocol, an improve-
ment by using depth factors (cid:3)= 0 has only been achieved for
the smallest width of 100 global states per front. The num-
ber of transitions executed until a fault tolerance violation
has been detected dropped by 13%.
For all depth factors (cid:3)=0, no signiﬁcant differences in the
results have been observed. The number of transitions ex-
ecuted for each width is equal for the pendulum protocol
model.
3.3. Experiment: Restriction of Spontaneous Tran-
sitions in Faulty Components
In section 2.2, decreasing weights for spontaneous tran-
sitions in faulty components has been discussed (eq.7). We
evaluate this restriction for the FlexRay model only. The
model of the pendulum protocol is implemented such that
each spontaneous transition within the faulty process will
ﬁre exactly once. Thus no beneﬁt can be expected through
applying this restriction. The fourth and ﬁfth column of ta-
ble 2 contain the results for decrease factors nDec of 0.5
and 0.1. The last column 0.1 SCO shows the results of ex-
periment 3.4 and will be discussed there.
While applying no decrease factor, i.e. nDec = 1.0 (sec.
3.2), yields no detection of a fault tolerance violation,
nDec = 0.5 and nDec = 0.1 show several cases where
such violation has been observed. The results substanti-
ate that reducing the number of times the same spontaneous
model → Pend. FlexRay

transitions in a faulty process may ﬁre, yields an improve-
ment of ﬁnding fault tolerance violating paths.
These results also support the conclusion of the previous
experiment that a small width leads to better performance.
The best results have been obtained with a depth factor
df(d(si)) = 0.01 · d(si). Out of the 10 scenarios with this
factor, 7 yield a path to a fault tolerance violation. The
differences between nDec = 0.5 and nDec = 0.1 are
marginal. With nDec = 0.5, seven paths have been ob-
tained, while nDec = 0.1 yields eight violation paths.

should be preferred. Although in 4 cases the elimina-
tion results in a path leading to a fault tolerance violation,
whereas the algorithm not eliminating signal-consumption-
only transitions did not discover such a path. Contrary, in 3
cases violation paths have been found without elimination
that could not be observed with elimination. The perfor-
mance of the algorithm ignoring signal-consumption-only
transitions is independent of the depth function.
The 4 cases yielding better results with execution of the
signal-consumption-only transitions can be ascribed to the
fact that those transitions will immediately lead to a recon-
vergence after their execution. Without elimination, the
front (restricted to some width) of the reachability graph
may contain those transitions. This corresponds to shrink-
ing the effective width restriction of the front as less other
transitions may be allowed in the front. As observed in the
previous experiments, small width is beneﬁcial.
Elimination of signal-consumption-only transitions in con-
junction with application of transition input weights will be
discussed in section 3.6.
3.5. Experiment: Transition Input Weights
In this section experiments evaluating different transition
input weights (sec. 2.2) are presented. These static weights
have been chosen large enough that different weights may
exhibit signiﬁcantly different consequences.
The width restriction for this experiment is 100 global
states per front and the depth factor df is zero. The decrease
factor nDec is set to 0.1. In this set of experiments signal-
consumption-only transitions are permitted.
For each of the static weights of the 7 input elements, we
assume ﬁve values: zero (w = 0) and 4 different weights
(w1 to w4) greater than zero: w0 < w1 < w2 < w3 < w4.
Thus, the maximum number of experimental runs is 57 =
78120.
In a ﬁrst step, the complete set of runs is performed for the
pendulum protocol. The results are analyzed and applied to
the FlexRay model, thus substantiating the generality of our
approach.
As the pendulum protocol model does neither contain
timer arrays, nor signals without parameters, the number
of required runs is reduced to 55 = 3125. Nevertheless,
the table with the complete results cannot be included here.
