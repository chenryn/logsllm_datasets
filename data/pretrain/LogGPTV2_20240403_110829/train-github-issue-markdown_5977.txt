### What happened
When entering a conn_id in the Connections section, there is currently no form
validation in place. This allows users to input a conn_id with a space at the
end for example, which results in errors when running tasks. The error message
displayed states that the connection doesn't exist, which can be misleading
and time-consuming to debug.
### What you think should happen instead
Form validation should be added to the Connections section to prevent conn_id
inputs with trailing spaces from being saved and instead save the conn_id
without the trailing spaces.
### How to reproduce
  * Go to the Connections section of the application.
  * Enter a conn_id with a space at the end.
  * Save the form or attempt to run a task with the conn_id.
