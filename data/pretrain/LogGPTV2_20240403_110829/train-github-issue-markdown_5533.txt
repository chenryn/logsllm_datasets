### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The docstring of find_objects does not specify the order in which the slices
are returned, but (per #277 and #13648 (comment)) it seems that it returns
them "in order", i.e. first the slices corresponding to label 1, then the
slice corresponding to label 2, etc. This is nice, but not obvious given the
current docstring:
        Find objects in a labeled array.
        Parameters
        ----------
        input : ndarray of ints
            Array containing objects defined by different labels. Labels with
            value 0 are ignored.
        max_label : int, optional
            Maximum label to be searched for in `input`. If max_label is not
            given, the positions of all objects are returned.
        Returns
        -------
        object_slices : list of tuples
            A list of tuples, with each tuple containing N slices (with N the
            dimension of the input array). Slices correspond to the minimal
            parallelepiped that contains the object.
            Each tuple If a number is missing,
            None is returned instead of a slice.
e.g. it could easily have been the case that slices are simply returned in the
order in which objects are seen when raster scanning through the image. (The
remark about None and missing numbers hints at the actual behavior, but is
quite implicit.)
### Describe the solution you'd like.
Clarify that label `l` corresponds to index `l - 1` in the returned array.
### Describe alternatives you've considered.
