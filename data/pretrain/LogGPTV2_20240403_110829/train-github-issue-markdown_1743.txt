Since release of 2.0.0 the sdist / *.tar.gz release is not present in pypi
package repo. This will prevent automated pipelines from ingesting the release
and generating customized wheels that is usually the process in bigger
companies.
Considering that we already have the tooling to create sdist packages as part
of CI code present in the codebase, Please kindly re-instate sdist as part of
generic release process and make sdist available as part of pypi artifacts.
Thanks
