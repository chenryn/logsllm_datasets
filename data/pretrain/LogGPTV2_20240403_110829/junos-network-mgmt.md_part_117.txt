Delete Packet Capture Files
Deleting packet capture files from the /var/tmp directory only temporarily removes the packet capture
files. Packet capture files for the interface are automatically created again the next time a packet capture
configuration change is committed or as part of a packet capture file rotation.
To delete a packet capture file:
1. Disable packet capture (see "Disabling Packet Capture" on page 1479).
2. Delete the packet capture file for the interface.
a. From operational mode, access the local UNIX shell.
user@host> start shell
%
b. Navigate to the directory where packet capture files are stored.
% cd /var/tmp
%
c. Delete the packet capture file for the interface; for example pcap-file.fe.0.0.0.
% rm pcap-file.fe.0.0.0
%
d. Return to operational mode.
% exit
user@host>
3. Reenable packet capture (see "Example: Enabling Packet Capture on a Device" on page 1463).
4. If you are done configuring the device, enter commit from configuration mode.

Display Packet Headers
Enter the monitor traffic command to display packet headers transmitted through network interfaces
with the following syntax:
NOTE: Using the monitor traffic command can degrade system performance. We recommend that
you use filtering options—such as count and matching—to minimize the impact to packet throughput
on the system.
user@host> monitor traffic         
Table 167 on page 1482 describes the monitor traffic command options.
Table 167: CLI monitor traffic Command Options
Option Description
absolute-sequence (Optional) Displays the absolute TCP sequence numbers.
count number (Optional) Displays the specified number of packet headers. Specify a value
from 0 through 100,000. The command quits and exits to the command prompt
after this number is reached.
interface interface-name (Optional) Displays packet headers for traffic on the specified interface. If an
interface is not specified, the lowest numbered interface is monitored.
layer2-headers (Optional) Displays the link-layer packet header on each line.
matching "expression" (Optional) Displays packet headers that match an expression enclosed in
quotation marks (" "). Table 168 on page 1484 through Table 170 on page
1487 list match conditions, logical operators, and arithmetic, binary, and
relational operators you can use in the expression.
1483
Table 167: CLI monitor traffic Command Options (Continued)
Option Description
no-domain-names (Optional) Suppresses the display of the domain name portion of the
hostname.
no-promiscuous (Optional) Specifies not to place the monitored interface in promiscuous mode.
In promiscuous mode, the interface reads every packet that reaches it. In
nonpromiscuous mode, the interface reads only the packets addressed to it.
no-resolve (Optional) Suppresses the display of hostnames.
no-timestamp (Optional) Suppresses the display of packet header timestamps.
print-ascii (Optional) Displays each packet header in ASCII format.
print-hex (Optional) Displays each packet header, except link-layer headers, in
hexadecimal format.
size bytes (Optional) Displays the number of bytes for each packet that you specify. If a
packet header exceeds this size, the displayed packet header is truncated. The
default value is 96.
brief (Optional) Displays minimum packet header information. This is the default.
detail (Optional) Displays packet header information in moderate detail. For some
protocols, you must also use the size option to see detailed information.
extensive (Optional) Displays the most extensive level of packet header information. For
some protocols, you must also use the size option to see extensive
information.
To quit the monitor traffic command and return to the command prompt, press Ctrl-C.
To limit the packet header information displayed by the monitor traffic command, include the matching
"expression" option. An expression consists of one or more match conditions listed in Table 168 on page
1484
1484, enclosed in quotation marks (" "). You can combine match conditions by using the logical
operators listed in Table 169 on page 1486 (shown in order of highest to lowest precedence).
For example, to display TCP or UDP packet headers, enter:
user@host> monitor traffic matching “tcp || udp”
To compare the following types of expressions, use the relational operators listed in Table 170 on page
1487 (listed from highest to lowest precedence):
• Arithmetic—Expressions that use the arithmetic operators listed in Table 170 on page 1487.
• Binary—Expressions that use the binary operators listed in Table 170 on page 1487.
• Packet data accessor—Expressions that use the following syntax:
protocol [byte-offset ]
Replace protocol with any protocol in Table 168 on page 1484. Replace byte-offset with the byte
offset, from the beginning of the packet header, to use for the comparison. The optional size
parameter represents the number of bytes examined in the packet header—1, 2, or 4 bytes.
For example, the following command displays all multicast traffic:
user@host> monitor traffic matching “ether[0] & 1 !=0”
Table 168: CLI monitor traffic Match Conditions

Troubleshooting DNS Name Resolution in Logical System Security
Policies (Primary Administrators Only)
IN THIS SECTION
Problem | 1489
Cause | 1489
Solution | 1489
Problem
Description
The address of a hostname in an address book entry that is used in a security policy might fail to resolve
correctly.
Cause
Normally, address book entries that contain dynamic hostnames refresh automatically for SRX Series
Firewalls. The TTL field associated with a DNS entry indicates the time after which the entry should be
refreshed in the policy cache. Once the TTL value expires, the SRX Series Firewall automatically
refreshes the DNS entry for an address book entry.
However, if the SRX Series Firewall is unable to obtain a response from the DNS server (for example, the
DNS request or response packet is lost in the network or the DNS server cannot send a response), the
address of a hostname in an address book entry might fail to resolve correctly. This can cause traffic to
drop as no security policy or session match is found.
Solution
The primary administrator can use the show security dns-cache command to display DNS cache information
on the SRX Series Firewall. If the DNS cache information needs to be refreshed, the primary
administrator can use the clear security dns-cache command.
1490
NOTE: These commands are only available to the primary administrator on devices that are
configured for logical systems. This command is not available in user logical systems or on
devices that are not configured for logical systems.

Determine Which CoS Components Are Applied to the Constituent Links
IN THIS SECTION
Problem | 1491
Solution | 1491
1491
Problem
Description
You are configuring a multilink bundle, but you also have traffic without MLPPP encapsulation passing
through constituent links of the multilink bundle. Do you apply all CoS components to the constituent
links, or is applying them to the multilink bundle enough?
Solution
You can apply a scheduler map to the multilink bundle and its constituent links. Although you can apply
several CoS components with the scheduler map, configure only the ones that are required. We
recommend that you keep the configuration on the constituent links simple to avoid unnecessary delay
in transmission.
Table 1 shows the CoS components to be applied on a multilink bundle and its constituent links.
Table 171: CoS Components Applied on Multilink Bundles and Constituent Links
Cos Component Multilink Constituent Explanation
Bundle Links
Classifier Yes No CoS classification takes place on the incoming
side of the interface, not on the transmitting side,
so no classifiers are needed on constituent links.
Forwarding class Yes No Forwarding class is associated with a queue, and
the queue is applied to the interface by a
scheduler map. The queue assignment is
predetermined on the constituent links. All
packets from Q2 of the multilink bundle are
assigned to Q2 of the constituent link, and
packets from all the other queues are queued to
Q0 of the constituent link.
1492
Table 171: CoS Components Applied on Multilink Bundles and Constituent Links (Continued)
Cos Component Multilink Constituent Explanation
Bundle Links
Scheduler map Yes Yes Apply scheduler maps on the multilink bundle and
the constituent link as follows:
• Transmit rate—Make sure that the relative
order of the transmit rate configured on Q0
and Q2 is the same on the constituent links as
on the multilink bundle.
• Scheduler priority—Make sure that the relative
order of the scheduler priority configured on
Q0 and Q2 is the same on the constituent
links as on the multilink bundle.
• Buffer size—Because all non-LFI packets from
the multilink bundle transit on Q0 of the
constituent links, make sure that the buffer
size on Q0 of the constituent links is large
enough.
• RED drop profile—Configure a RED drop
profile on the multilink bundle only.
Configuring the RED drop profile on the
constituent links applies a back pressure
mechanism that changes the buffer size and
introduces variation. Because this behavior
might cause fragment drops on the
constituent links, make sure to leave the RED
drop profile at the default settings on the
constituent links.
Shaping rate for a per-unit No Yes Because per-unit scheduling is applied only at the
scheduler or an interface- end point, apply this shaping rate to the
level scheduler constituent links only. Any configuration applied
earlier is overwritten by the constituent link
configuration.
1493
Table 171: CoS Components Applied on Multilink Bundles and Constituent Links (Continued)
Cos Component Multilink Constituent Explanation
Bundle Links
Transmit-rate exact or Yes No The interface-level shaping applied on the
queue-level shaping constituent links overrides any shaping on the
queue. Thus apply transmit-rate exact shaping on
the multilink bundle only.
Rewrite rules Yes No Rewrite bits are copied from the packet into the
fragments automatically during fragmentation.
Thus what you configure on the multilink bundle
is carried on the fragments to the constituent
links.
Virtual channel group Yes No Virtual channel groups are identified through
firewall filter rules that are applied on packets
only before the multilink bundle. Thus you do not
need to apply the virtual channel group
configuration to the constituent links.

Determine What Causes Jitter and Latency on the Multilink Bundle
IN THIS SECTION
Problem | 1494
Solution | 1494
1494
Problem
Description
To test jitter and latency, you send three streams of IP packets. All packets have the same IP precedence
settings. After configuring LFI and CRTP, the latency increased even over a noncongested link. How can
you reduce jitter and latency?
Solution
To reduce jitter and latency, do the following:
1. Make sure that you have configured a shaping rate on each constituent link.
2. Make sure that you have not configured a shaping rate on the link services interface.
3. Make sure that the configured shaping rate value is equal to the physical interface bandwidth.
4. If shaping rates are configured correctly, and jitter still persists, contact the Juniper Networks
Technical Assistance Center (JTAC).
Determine If LFI and Load Balancing Are Working Correctly
IN THIS SECTION
Problem | 1494
Solution | 1495
Problem
Description
In this case, you have a single network that supports multiple services. The network transmits data and
delay-sensitive voice traffic. After configuring MLPPP and LFI, make sure that voice packets are
transmitted across the network with very little delay and jitter. How can you find out if voice packets are
being treated as LFI packets and load balancing is performed correctly?
1495
Solution
When LFI is enabled, data (non-LFI) packets are encapsulated with an MLPPP header and fragmented to
packets of a specified size. The delay-sensitive, voice (LFI) packets are PPP-encapsulated and interleaved
between data packet fragments. Queuing and load balancing are performed differently for LFI and non-
LFI packets.
To verify that LFI is performed correctly, determine that packets are fragmented and encapsulated as
configured. After you know whether a packet is treated as an LFI packet or a non-LFI packet, you can
confirm whether the load balancing is performed correctly.
Solution Scenario—Suppose two Juniper Networks devices, R0 and R1, are connected by a multilink
bundle lsq-0/0/0.0 that aggregates two serial links, se-1/0/0 and se-1/0/1. On R0 and R1, MLPPP and LFI
are enabled on the link services interface and the fragmentation threshold is set to 128 bytes.
In this example, we used a packet generator to generate voice and data streams. You can use the packet
capture feature to capture and analyze the packets on the incoming interface.
The following two data streams were sent on the multilink bundle:
• 100 data packets of 200 bytes (larger than the fragmentation threshold)
• 500 data packets of 60 bytes (smaller than the fragmentation threshold)
The following two voice streams were sent on the multilink bundle:
