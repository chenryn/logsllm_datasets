User: On a Linux box I want to run a Python script as another user.
I've already made a wrapper program in C++ that calls the script, since I've realized that the ownership of running the script is decided by the ownership of the python interpreter. After that I change the C++ program to a different user and run the C++ program.
This setup doesn't seem to be working. Any ideas?
Assistant: Give those users the ability to sudo su $dedicated_username and tailor the permissions on your system so that $dedicated_user has sufficient, but not excessive, access.
