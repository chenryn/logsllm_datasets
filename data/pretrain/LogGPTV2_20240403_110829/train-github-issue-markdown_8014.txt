### Update
For a true ORM upsert functionality, please refer to the new feature in SQLAlchemy 2.0, detailed at [this documentation page](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/queryguide/dml.html#orm-upsert-statements).

Currently, when using the `Session` class and its `add` method, there is no way to specify `ON CONFLICT` behavior. The `add` method determines whether to perform an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operation, but this decision is not configurable.

Adding configurable `ON CONFLICT` behavior to the `add` method would be a valuable enhancement.
