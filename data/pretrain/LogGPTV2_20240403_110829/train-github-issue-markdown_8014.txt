###  **update** \- for real ORM upsert, please see SQLAlchemy 2.0's new
feature at https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/queryguide/dml.html#orm-
upsert-statements
Currently there is no way to specify `on conflict` behaviour when using
`session` class and it's `add` method which makes a decision to either
`insert` or `update`.  
This would be a nice addition to have `on conflict` behaviour of this method
configurable.
