User: Please determine which operating systems can run Docker containers, and provide detailed running steps.
Assistant: The official Docker documentation lists the supported operating systems for Docker: 1. Windows - Windows Server 2019 - Windows Server 2016 - Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise/Education 2. macOS - macOS Mojave 10.14 or later 3. Linux - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or higher - CentOS 7 or higher - Fedora 29 or higher - Ubuntu 16.04 or higher - Debian 9 or higher - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 or higher Steps to run the Docker container under the system: 1. Install Docker According to different Linux distributions, execute the corresponding installation command on the command line to install Docker. For example, the installation command under Ubuntu is: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt -get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io ``` 2. Download the Docker image Docker Hub provides a large number of Docker images, you can use the docker pull command to download the required image on the command line. For example, to download the image of Ubuntu 20.04, you can execute: ``` docker pull ubuntu:20.04 ``` 3. Run the Docker container Use the docker run command to create and run the Docker container, for example, to run a bash terminal in the Ubuntu 20.04 image: ``` docker run -it ubuntu:20.04 /bin/bash ``` This command will create a new Docker container and start a bash terminal in it, where the user can execute any command. Execute the exit command in the terminal to exit the container, and the container will stop running. The above are the general steps to run the Docker container under the Linux system, and the specific operations can be adjusted according to the actual situation.
