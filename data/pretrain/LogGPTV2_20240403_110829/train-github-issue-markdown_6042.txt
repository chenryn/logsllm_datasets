**Current behavior**  
If i have component that is displayed by router and i want to use animations
for this component i can do it by:
    @HostBinding("@flyInOut")
    private get _pageAnimation(): boolean
    {
        return true;
    }
If i move this code to "base" class which is extended by my component it stops
working. Im not sure if this is only problem of router animations, or
`HostBinding`.
Also if use `HostListener` for listening to animation start event no event
parameter is passed to this callback.
    @HostListener("@flyInOut.start")
    private _startAnimation(event: AnimationTransitionEvent)
    {
        //event is undefined
    }
**Expected behavior**  
Both scenarios should work.
