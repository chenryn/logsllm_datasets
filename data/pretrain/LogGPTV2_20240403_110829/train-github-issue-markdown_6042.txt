**Current Behavior**
When I have a component that is displayed by the router and I want to use animations for this component, I can achieve this by using the following code:

```typescript
@HostBinding("@flyInOut")
private get _pageAnimation(): boolean {
    return true;
}
```

However, if I move this code to a base class that is extended by my component, it stops working. I am unsure whether this is a problem specific to router animations or `HostBinding` in general.

Additionally, when using `HostListener` to listen to the animation start event, no event parameter is passed to the callback:

```typescript
@HostListener("@flyInOut.start")
private _startAnimation(event: AnimationTransitionEvent) {
    // event is undefined
}
```

**Expected Behavior**
Both scenarios (using `HostBinding` in a base class and receiving the event parameter in `HostListener`) should work as expected.
