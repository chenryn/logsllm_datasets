Interview with Edgar Mitchell, ScD., Captain USN (Ret)
by 
Richard Thieme 
RT: You’ve been involved with consciousness studies, including the exploration of
UFOs, for some time. What’s your primary focus? 
EM: My focus has never been primarily on UFOs. My focus has been consciousness
studies for thirty years. I kind of back doored into this because of my work in
consciousness studies and talking to John Mack about abductees or experiencers as he
prefers to call them. 
I ran into a large number of what I call the “old timers,” people in government, in the
military and intelligence work going back fifty years, who say, “Yes, it’s all true.”
RT: When I was a parish priest on the edge of an air force base, I was told by a member
of the parish, an air force fighter pilot, that the basic reports were true – that our pilots
have encountered vehicles which have paced fighters and literally flown rings around
them, doing things that even in black budget projects at the time were impossible.
Because I know that black budget projects create technologies that seem fantastic to
ordinary people, I like to focus on early reports, from 1947-1952, when the waters were
not quite so muddy.
EM: That has been my focus too. I grew up in Roswell NM and remember when that
story broke. I was just a kid in high school. When it was dismissed the next day as
weather balloons I wrote it off and went about my business. My grandparents were in the
cattle business and knew the Brazells. So we were there but it never really came back to
me until ten-twelve years ago when I really became interested in the consciousness stuff
and John Mack and I started getting literature and seeing names I recognized from
Roswell. I was close personal friends with Werner von Braun. Although he never
mentioned that event, he was very interested in my consciousness work. And then a few
other people, military, retired generals and admirals, that years ago I happened to
encounter, and they all said oh yes, it really was all real, we just couldn’t talk about it at
the time. They’re still reluctant to talk about it.
RT: “It” means ...?”
EM: Something like the Roswell incident was real. I’m not sure we have all the details
correct right down to the nitty-gritty fundamentals but the fact of the incident itself and it
being a non-earth craft, that seems to be without question according to the testimony of
these people. 
RT: What is your understanding of the phenomena at this point?
EM: We discovered 8-9 years ago a mechanism in physics called the quantum hologram.
It was discovered trying to perfect MRI machines and build quantum computers. Trying
to improve the resolution and imaging on a MRI resulted in the quantum hologram. It’s
rooted in the fact that matter at its most basic level does not consist of ping-pong-ball
atoms but flowing dynamic energy. Quanta of energy are emitted and reabsorbed by all
matter down to the most basic level.
Those emissions from all physical objects are quanta but it has turned out that they are
sufficiently coherent that they carry information about the object and we now have both
theory and good experimental evidence on that fact. The interesting thing is that the
information is non-local. The formalism of the quantum hologram is non-local. 
To have nature having a non-local information structure that carries the event history of
each physical object puts a whole different perspective on things. When these guys
brought this to me I had given a lecture at Cambridge University, St John’s College, in
England, on what I call a dyadic model, which says, if you start with energy and
information and define information as patterns of energy, then the basis of our universe
has two fundamental aspects. It exists because of its energetic structure and it’s knowing
because of the information structure. If you start with that basic premise, that energy has
two forms, a structural form and a patternal form which is the basis of knowing anything,
so that information is the basis of knowing anything and patterns of energy are just
information, if you start with that you can build a pretty decent cosmology for an
evolving  knowing thinking universe. Because we evolved out of it and are part of the
universe, therefore it must be a knowing thinking universe. 
This also goes back to the very definition of non-locality coming out of quantum physics,
that particles ever interacting maintain a spin correlation wherever they go until they
interact with something else. The quantum hologram takes that idea from the particle
level and expands it to all macro scale objects. It extends quantum mechanics from the
particle level to virtually all matter. And it says that all matter not only has a local here-
and-now structure but also a non-local everywhere informational structure. The history,
the events in the life of that object, are carried non-locally throughout the universe. We
know so little about the characteristics of non-locality. With the quantum hologram, it is
mathematically defined that information is recovered through resonance. We have written
the math on it and we have physically done it in the laboratory. But still, exactly how a
non-local resonance takes place, we don’t know; we know it takes place in far distances
compared with the size of a particle, but what that means in terms of the universe, I
haven’t the faintest idea. And neither does anyone else. But still, the mathematics shows
that the hologram is non-local and if you look carefully it starts to show why we have
psychic experience and internal mystical experience, in fact, it seems to be why we have
subjective experience at all.
RT: I used to facilitate exercises in psychometry during which people attempted to
receive impressions or information from objects. Some of the results were striking. 
EM: Richard, that is precisely what the quantum hologram as a structure explains. So I
have written several papers on this, as are others. I started working on it in 1995 after
these fellows came to me after my lecture and said we think we’ve found a structure that
seems to validate what you’re saying about information, we’re using it for quantum
computers and MRI machines. Those guys and I have been working on this for five years
and the concepts are finding their way through the science and physics literature. Not in
Nature yet but a few mentions, no major article yet – they’re too conservative – but
papers have been written on how DNA learns, how cells learn. Our thesis is that
consciousness is not a thing but a feedback loop in nature. How does an electron know
what its spin is supposed to be if it’s across the universe from its partner? If you take that
to the complex level of the organized brain, then the knowing is appropriate. But the very
basis of this non-local resonance that occurs at the particle level, if you then say, it is a
feedback loop, a resonance feedback loop which we observe here in macroscopic nature,
it would appear that this is precisely what consciousness is, except that I prefer the words
awareness or perception, because it appears that only animals with brains have self-
awareness and only Homo sapiens have self-reflective awareness and can reflect upon
our reflections. All animals with a brain can distinguish self from nature, but animals
without brains have awareness and perception but not self-awareness, they’re part of the
environment. If you trace that down to the inanimate world where the quantum
correlation of particles prevails and the quantum hologram is still a property of inanimate
matter, it’s saying that nature does not lose its experience, nature is informational and
conscious at some level. That’s the work I have been pursuing. To say that consciousness
is not amenable to scientific study is just plain wrong. 
RT: The biggest barrier is scientific –
EM: Kuhn was right and so was Max Planck, who said that progress in science is not
made by convincing skeptics but funeral by funeral. That’s what we’re dealing with.
RT: Whether it’s religion or science, the dynamics are the same. 
EM: To jump to the bottom line, the quantum hologram is as close as we come in the
moment to the theological concept of spirit of soul. What it doesn’t do in this model is
have discarnate action, it’s an informational structure, and that fits into the great sea of
consciousness concept which this model suggests is absolutely right.
RT: Are other astronauts involved in this search?
EM: Not many astronauts are philosophically deep. But many of the younger ones accept
UFO phenomena and are open to meditation or the paranormal and other consciousness
explorations. I have often been a lone wolf, a voice in the wilderness, but I have worked
in this for thirty years and it’s finally paying off.
RT: What you’re saying makes sense from so many converging points of view that are
helping us construct reality in new ways.
EM: The Cartesian division between materialism on one side and spirituality and
mentality on the other in a different realm is wrong.
RT: Paranormal phenomena is very difficult to discuss because, by the time you can say
what “it” is, the names disappear. They names don’t distinguish real differences. 
EM: They don’t mean anything. That’s exactly right. And that’s what the quantum
hologram shows. People who purport to communicate with the dead or have psychic
experiences are picking up information from the morphogenetic field or the holographic
field and as far as they’re concerned, it’s real, and it is real, but their interpretation is not
correct.
RT: Abduction “evidence” too comes from people in altered states either at the time or
afterward at the hands of researchers. So how can we know the objectivity of what’s
reported?
EM: That’s right,. People will interpret it through their own experience and biases. That’s
how I got involved. John Mack was reading some of my material and asked me how to
interpret some of his work. That’s what got me into the ET stuff. Also, given this type of
