examined incentives to ensure the security of multi-party
computation in the Bitcoin blockchain [12]. They showcase the
feasibility of timed commitments in Bitcoin as well as a lottery
protocol. Kumaresan and Bentov examined incentivization for
veriﬁable computation and proposed a mechanism to non-
interactively reward bounties for solving hard problems [46].
The presented approach, however, is impractical as it suffers
from the limitations of Bitcoin’s language script and from
the hybrid model that relies on ideal functionalities, which
are implemented through costly garbled circuits and zero-
knowledge proofs. While support for zero-knowledge proofs is
planned for Ethereum [25], we instead focus on the incentives
of a TLS-like PKI built on the blockchain.
D. Insurance Schemes
Even before cryptocurrencies, the idea of electronic insur-
ance policies were used to evaluate services in distributed
systems [47]. The idea of insurance was also proposed as
an example of an authentication metric that followed good
design principles [76]. However, both of these proposals offer
little accountability and cannot be effectively realized without
cryptocurrencies. Certiﬁcates-as-an-Insurance (CaaI) was the
ﬁrst to propose the idea of integrating insurance into TLS
certiﬁcates as a means of balancing CA control and liability,
but only presented challenges and principles for desgning
such a system [59]. Our work on IKP adds a cryptocurrency-
based instantiation of the CaaI model as well as proofs of
incentivization compared to log-based PKIs.
XII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed IKP, a platform for reporting
unauthorized certiﬁcates and responding to CA misbehavior in
an automated and incentivized fashion. We described the full
process from registering a CA to claiming reaction payouts.
We developed a model describing reaction payouts, which
helped us discover the constraints to guide the negotiation
of reasonable reaction policies. Finally, we discussed the
deployability incentives in today’s Internet and created an
decentralized instantiation of IKP based on Ethereum. Our
work does not stop all misbehaving CAs, nor does it always
enforce accountability on CAs that are misbehaving. We
observe, however, an urgent need to incentivize good CA
behavior in this way in order to make TLS more secure, and
we argue that IKP is a ﬁrst concrete step towards that goal.
