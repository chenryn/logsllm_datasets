```

```

After this error, I receive another error block, which varies depending on whether I click on the Menu component or if I am in a Drawer:

```
The above error occurred in the <Transition> component:
    in Transition (created by Slide)
    in EventListener (created by Slide)
    in Slide (created by WithTheme(Slide))
    in WithTheme(Slide) (created by Drawer)

    in Drawer (created by WithStyles(Drawer))
    in WithStyles(Drawer) (at AppBar/index.js:524)

    in StateProvider (at src/index.js:30)

```

### Additional Information
- The code works fine in a sandbox environment.
- I do not use the `findDOMNode` function in my project.

### Steps Taken to Resolve
- Removed all context providers.
- Removed the Material-UI provider.
- Removed Suspense and lazy loading.

However, none of these changes resolved the issue.
