after this error , i get this error block ( but it is different , because some
times i click on Menu component and some times i am in a Drawer ) .
    The above error occurred in the  component:
        in Transition (created by Slide)
        in EventListener (created by Slide)
        in Slide (created by WithTheme(Slide))
        in WithTheme(Slide) (created by Drawer)
        in div (created by Drawer)
        in Drawer (created by WithStyles(Drawer))
        in WithStyles(Drawer) (at AppBar/index.js:524)
        in div (at AppBar/index.js:457)
        in Index (created by WithStyles(Index))
        in WithStyles(Index) (at App.js:98)
        in BalanceStateProvider (at App.js:96)
        in LoginStateProvider (at App.js:95)
        in DrawerStateProvider (at App.js:94)
        in Suspense (at App.js:93)
        in MuiThemeProviderOld (at App.js:92)
        in Router (at App.js:91)
        in App (at src/index.js:31)
        in StateProvider (at src/index.js:30)
        in Router (created by BrowserRouter)
        in BrowserRouter (at src/index.js:29)
when i write the code in sandbox , everything works fine , but in my project ,
is not .  
even i dont know where i have to check for this error , because i have no
`findDomNode` function .
##### what i did for this
  * remove all contexts
  * remove material-ui provider
  * remove Suspense and lazy
but nothing change
