User: In an enterprise-level application system, how to ensure data security and password compliance? Please provide a complete solution, including identity authentication, access control, encrypted storage, etc.
Assistant: Data security and password compliance of enterprise-level application systems are very important. Here are some solutions: 1. Identity authentication: User authentication is the first step in data security. Common identity authentication methods include single sign-on and two-factor authentication , multi-factor authentication, etc. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing the system. 2. Access control: Access control can be divided into role-level and semantic-level permissions. Role level refers to grouping users according to roles and granting different permissions, such as administrators and ordinary users. The semantic level is to set different permissions for different data types, such as read permissions, write permissions, delete permissions, etc. 3. Data encryption: Encrypting sensitive data is a critical step, including encrypted storage and transmission encryption. Encrypted storage refers to encrypting sensitive data in the database so that only authorized users can decrypt and read it. Transmission encryption refers to encrypting data before network transmission to prevent data leakage. 4. Recording logs: Recording logs is to track and monitor the operation of the system, so as to find and solve problems when they occur. Each user's operation record, fault log and security log can be recorded in the log. 5. Security audit: According to business needs, conduct regular security audits, conduct security checks and vulnerability scans on the system, and discover and repair vulnerabilities in time to prevent hacking and data leakage.
