3.  In-band wormholes in OLSR 
In  OLSR,  a  proactive  link-state  routing  protocol 
[21], the status of 1-hop links is gathered through the 
exchange  of  HELLO  messages  among  1-hop 
neighbors.  Topology Control (TC) messages are then 
used  to  propagate  link-state  information  to  all  other 
nodes.    From  this  information,  nodes  formulate  next-
hop  routing  decisions  based  on  the  shortest-path 
computations. 
In an in-band wormhole attack, two distant colluding 
nodes  create  a  shared  tunnel  and  use  it  to  covertly 
transfer OLSR control messages (e.g., HELLO and TC 
messages) between remote nodes.  The eventual result 
is  that  OLSR  is  tricked  into  thinking  that  the  remote 
nodes are one-hop neighbors and that the link between 
them  is  a  shortcut.    This  attracts  traffic,  and  the 
attracted  packets  are  then  forwarded  by  the  attackers 
through the tunnel, completing the wormhole illusion.  
An  in-band  wormhole  can  fall  victim  to  its  own 
success, as the disruption in network routing can also 
affect  the  routing  of  traffic  through  the  wormhole 
tunnel, causing the wormhole to collapse [14].  An in-
band  wormhole  collapses  when  its  tunnel  endpoints 
cannot continue to forward control messages between 
remote  network  regions.    One  way  to  avoid  tunnel 
collapse is to use additional colluding nodes along the 
tunnel path as application layer waypoints.

Figure 1 shows the normal route between a source of 
traffic, node 197, and a destination, node 184.  In this 
example,  the  route  passes  through  intermediate  nodes 
178, 198, and 179 and is 4 hops in length.  Also shown 
are three colluding attackers, nodes 180, 186, and 183.  
Note that the normal path between 197 and 184 does 
not pass through any of the attacking nodes. 
Figure 2 shows the same topology and illustrates the 
impact  of  a  self-contained  in-band  wormhole  on  this 
path.    The  wormhole  link  (the  illusory  shortcut) 
stretches between nodes 180 and 183.  The tunnel used 
to create the illusion passes the following sequence of 
nodes: (180, 178, 189, 186, 198, 187, 183).  The role of

node  186  in  the  attack  is  to  serve  as  an  application-

lengthens  the  tunnel  path.    Nodes  178,  189,  198,  and 
187 are unwitting participants.   
Once  the  wormhole  is  activated,  nodes  in  the 
network are tricked into believing that a shorter, 3-hop 
path  exists  between  nodes  197  and  184  via  the 
wormhole link (197, 180, 183, 184).  In contrast to the 
normal  path,  this  apparently  shorter  path  passes 
through  all  three  attacking  nodes,  providing  each  of 
those nodes an opportunity to control or disrupt traffic 
between 197 and 184, as well as traffic between other 
nearby  pairs  of  nodes.    As  a  result,  node  197  will 
forward to node 180 all traffic destined for 184.  Node 
180 will forward the traffic through the covert tunnel, 
via node 186, to node 183.  When the traffic emerges 
from  the  tunnel,  node  183  will  forward  it  to  184,  its 
final  destination.    Traffic  from  197  to  184,  which 
appears to be traveling only 3 hops, will in fact travel 8 
hops, and pass through each of the attackers. 
4.  Resilient detection of in-band 
wormholes 
In  this  section,  we  discuss  our  strategies  for 
detecting  and  localizing  in-band  wormholes  and  for 
making  the  detector  resilient  to  injection  of  bogus 
detection  data.    We  also  describe  our  prototype 
detection system. 
4.1.  Detection strategy  
The disparity between the apparent path length and 
the actual path length provides a potential opportunity 
to detect such attacks.  Loss and delay are inherent to 
the  wireless 
from  which  MANETs  are 
constructed.  Since loss and delay are cumulative, the 
wormhole link, which is actually is a 6-hop tunnel, is 
likely  to  exhibit  substantially  higher  loss  and  delay 
characteristics  than  a  true,  single-hop  link.    Our 
detection  strategy  is  based  on  this  premise,  namely, 
links

that wormholes will have a measurable impact in terms 
of packet timing or loss on the traffic they carry.  This 
premise  has  been  investigated  by  other  researchers 
[10].  A wormhole tunnel that provides reliable end-to-
end  transport  can  completely  mask  the  cumulative 
effects  of  loss,  which,  for  long  tunnels,  may  be  so 
pronounced  that  OLSR  refuses  to  recognize  the 
wormhole  link’s  existence  [14].    However,  a  reliable 
tunnel  will  transform  path  loss  into  packet  delays, 
because  lost  packets  will  not  be  retransmitted  until 
acknowledgements  have  timed  out.    Since  our  test 
topologies  involve  long  tunnels,  our  tests  will  use 
reliable  wormhole  tunnels  and  delay-based  detection.  
More specifically, our detection sensors will designate 
each  path  measured  as  either  anomalous  or  normal, 
depending  on  the  amount  of  roundtrip  delay  that  is 
observed. 
The simplest way to detect the presence and location 
of the self-contained wormhole link shown in Figure 2 
would  be  to  obtain  roundtrip  loss  and  delay  statistics 
from nodes 180 and 183.  These nodes, however, are 
the attackers.  One cannot rely on them to report such 
statistics correctly, as doing so would mean voluntarily 
identifying 
intrusion  detection 
system.    If  the  attackers  are  sophisticated,  they  may 
know  how  the  intrusion  detection  system  works  and 
may  lie  by  reporting  loss  and  delay  statistics  that  are 
typical  for  a  true  link.    This  illustrates  how  a 
cooperative 
intrusion  detection 
system  can  be 
undermined by injecting bogus data.

To help focus our research on this specific problem,

we make the following assumptions: 
•  There are at most two colluding attackers in any 
3-hop neighborhood. 
•  Probe  packets  measuring  roundtrip  loss  and 
delay can be made stealthy so that intermediate 
nodes  along  the  path  can  neither  distinguish 
them  from  other  packets  nor  give 
them 
preferential treatment. 
•  Measurements can be communicated reliably to

assumption is discussed further in Section 7.) 
•  Hop-by-hop  and  end-to-end  authentication 
services, together with recent knowledge of the 
local  topology,  can  be  used  to  prove  that  a 
measurement  probe  followed  the  path  claimed 
by the reporting node.  
4.2.  Byzantine resilience strategies 
In  this  section,  we  present  three  strategies  for 
making 
in-band 
wormholes resilient to Byzantine behavior by detection 
sensors.

sensors 
4.2.1. “No self-reports”.  As discussed above, if nodes 
on  which  detection 
reside  may  be 
compromised, it makes no sense to collect loss or delay 
measurements about link characteristics from the nodes 
that  control  those  links;  doing  so  amounts  to  asking 
nodes to report on their own misbehavior.  Instead, our 
first  strategy 
rely  only  on  “third-party” 
observations.  Instead of collecting link measurements 
directly, we collect measurements of longer paths that 
pass through the link, obtaining these from neighbors 
of the link’s endpoints.  We then attempt to infer the 
loss or delay characteristics of the link by correlating 
multiple measurements.  This is illustrated in Figure 3.

To  determine  the  characteristics  of  link  BC,  the 
neighbors of B and C collect roundtrip measurements 
of  the  3-hop  paths  that  pass  through  BC.    In  this 
example,  node  A  collects  roundtrip  measurements  of

loss  or  delay 
measurements  along  those  two  paths  are  anomalous, 
and  if  there  is  at  most  one  wormhole  link  in  this 
neighborhood,  then  it  must  lie  at  the  intersection  of 
these paths, the link BC.  In this way, nodes A, D, E, 
and  F  are  acting  as  observers  of  link  BC,  and  of  the 
nodes that control it: B and C.  This avoids relying on 
B and C to report on themselves. 
  Note that a 3-hop path is the shortest path that avoids 
this  problem.  Using  measurements  from  longer  paths 
might  be  workable,  but  increases  the  difficulty  of 
determining  which  link  along  the  path  is  responsible 
for  the  measured  anomaly.    In  general,  making  this 
determination  would  require  correlating  observations 
from a larger pool of observers.

independent  corroboration.  An 
anomalous measurement along a single 3-hop path may 
indicate that a wormhole is present, but cannot identify 
which  of  the  three  hops  is  the  wormhole  link.    To 
localize the wormhole, two measurements through the 
wormhole link must be made by independent pairs of 
observers; in other words, the paths must have disjoint 
endpoints. As shown in Figure 4, if two measurement

paths have the same source (node A) and traverse the 
same middle hop, then their intersection includes two 
links  (AB  and  BC),  so  they  cannot  localize  the 
wormhole link.  Furthermore, they cannot be assumed 
to be independent, because the common source (node 
A)  could  fabricate  measurements  for  both  paths.  
Similarly,  if  two  paths  share  a  common  destination 
instead  of  source, 
independence  still  cannot  be 
assumed, because that destination can perturb both sets 
of  measurements.    Only  by  having  disjoint  endpoints 
can  measurements  be 
from 
independent  pairs  of  observers.    This  leads  to  our 
second  strategy:  detecting  a  self-contained  in-band 
wormhole  should  require  receiving  corroborating 
anomalous  path  measurements  from  at  least  two 
independent pairs of observers. 
4.2.3.  Voting  –  majority  rules. 
  By  requiring 
independent corroboration, the above strategy prevents 
a  single  malicious  node  from  being  able  to  launch  a 
successful  false  accusation  against  a  victim  link.  
However,  two  colluding  attackers  that  are  immediate 
neighbors  of  a  victim  link  may  be  able  to.    For 
example, in Figure 3, if any two of the nodes A, D, E, 
and  F  are  attackers,  they  may  be  able  to  corroborate 
each other’s false accusations of link BC.  One way to 
avoid  this  possibility  would  be  to  require  more  than 
two pairs of independent observers.  The drawback is 
that  some  true  wormholes  might  escape  detection  for 
lack of sufficient neighbors.

An  alternative  strategy  is  to  weigh  the  balance  of 
positive and negative votes before determining whether 
a link is anomalous or normal, i.e., seek a consensus of 
local observers.  As shown in Figure 5, if a sufficient

attackers will outvote the honest nodes.  As discussed 
below,  preventing  this  from  happening  requires  the 
presence of more honest observers than attackers.  
4.3.  Vote tallying and false accusations.   
Figure  6  shows  examples  of  how  votes  are  tallied 
and  how  independent  pairs  of  observers  are  counted.  
In  the  figure,  nodes  V1  and  V2  are  falsely  accused 
victims,  A1  and  A2  are  attackers,  and  the  remaining 
nodes (B through G) are honest observers.   We assume 
here  that  if  an  attacker  is  either  the  originator  of  a 
roundtrip  measurement  or  the  turnaround  point,  the 
measurement will be reported as anomalous.  In other 
words,  if  a  pair  of  observers  is  either  malicious  or 
mixed,  an  anomalous  vote  will  result.    Only  if  both 
observers are honest will a normal measurement result.  
This asymmetry means that a tie vote will require twice 
as many honest nodes as malicious nodes.
