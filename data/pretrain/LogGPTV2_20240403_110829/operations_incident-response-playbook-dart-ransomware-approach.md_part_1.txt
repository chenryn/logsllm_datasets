# Microsoft DART ransomware approach and best practices
[Human-operated ransomware](/security/ransomware/human-operated-ransomware) isn't a malicious software problem - it's a human criminal problem. The solutions used to address commodity problems aren't enough to prevent a threat that more closely resembles a nation-state threat actor who:
- Disables or uninstalls your antivirus software before encrypting files
- Disables security services and logging to avoid detection
- Locates and corrupts or deletes backups before sending a ransom demand
These actions are commonly done with legitimate programs that you might already have in your environment for administrative purposes. In criminal hands, these tools are used maliciously to carry out attacks.
Responding to the increasing threat of ransomware requires a combination of modern enterprise configuration, up-to-date security products, and the vigilance of trained security staff to detect and respond to the threats before data is lost.
The [Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/microsoft-detection-and-response-team-dart-blog-series/) responds to security compromises to help customers become cyber-resilient. DART provides onsite reactive incident response and remote proactive investigations. DART uses Microsoft's strategic partnerships with security organizations around the world and internal Microsoft product groups to provide the most complete and thorough investigation possible.
This article describes how DART handles ransomware attacks for Microsoft customers so that you can consider applying elements of their approach and best practices for your own security operations playbook.

## How DART uses Microsoft security services
DART relies heavily on data for all investigations and uses existing deployments of Microsoft security services such as [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security), [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security), [Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity), and [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/).
### Defender for Endpoint
Defender for Endpoint is Microsoft's enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise network security analysts prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. Defender for Endpoint can detect attacks using advanced behavioral analytics and machine learning. Your analysts can use Defender for Endpoint for attacker behavioral analytics.
Here's an example of an alert in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for a pass-the-ticket attack.

Your analysts can also perform advanced hunting queries to pivot off indicators of compromise (IOCs) or search for known behavior if they identify a threat actor group.
Here's an example of how advanced hunting queries can be used to locate known attacker behavior.

In Defender for Endpoint, you have access to a real-time expert-level monitoring and analysis service by Microsoft Threat Experts for ongoing suspected actor activity. You can also collaborate with experts on demand for more insights into alerts and incidents.
Here's an example of how Defender for Endpoint shows detailed ransomware activity.

### Defender for Identity
You use Defender for Identity to investigate known compromised accounts and to find potentially compromised accounts in your organization. Defender for Identity sends alerts for known malicious activity that actors often use such as DCSync attacks, remote code execution attempts, and pass-the-hash attacks. Defender for Identity enables you to pinpoint suspect activity and accounts to narrow down the investigation.
Here's an example of how Defender for Identity sends alerts for known malicious activity related to ransomware attacks.

### Defender for Cloud Apps
Defender for Cloud Apps (previously known as Microsoft Cloud App Security) allows your analysts to detect unusual behavior across cloud apps to identify ransomware, compromised users, or rogue applications. Defender for Cloud Apps is Microsoft's cloud access security broker (CASB) solution that allows for monitoring of cloud services and data access in cloud services by users.
Here's an example of the Defender for Cloud Apps dashboard, which allows analysis to detect unusual behavior across cloud apps.

### Microsoft Secure Score
The set of Microsoft Defender XDR services provides live remediation recommendations to reduce the attack surface. Microsoft Secure Score is a measurement of an organization's security posture, with a higher number indicating that more improvement actions have been taken. See the [Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score) documentation to find out more about how your organization can use this feature to prioritize remediation actions that are based on their environment.
## The DART approach to conducting ransomware incident investigations
You should make every effort to determine how the adversary gained access to your assets so that vulnerabilities can be remediated. Otherwise, it is highly likely that the same type of attack happens again in the future. In some cases, the threat actor takes steps to cover their tracks and destroy evidence, so it is possible that the entire chain of events might not be evident.
The following are three key steps in DART ransomware investigations:
|Step|Goal|Initial questions|
|---|---|---|
|1. Assess the current situation|Understand the scope|What initially made you aware of a ransomware attack?  What time/date did you first learn of the incident?  What logs are available and is there any indication that the actor is currently accessing systems?|
|2. Identify the affected line-of-business (LOB) apps|Get systems back online|Does the application require an identity?  Are backups of the application, configuration, and data available?  Are the content and integrity of backups regularly verified using a restore exercise?|
|3. Determine the compromise recovery (CR) process|Remove attacker control from the environment|N/A|
### Step 1: Assess the current situation
An assessment of the current situation is critical to understanding the scope of the incident and for determining the best people to assist and to plan and scope the investigation and remediation tasks. Asking the following initial questions is crucial in helping to determine the situation.
#### What initially made you aware of the ransomware attack?
If your IT staff identified the initial threat&ndash;such as noticing backups being deleted, antivirus alerts, endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts, or suspicious system changes&ndash;it is often possible to take quick decisive measures to thwart the attack, typically by disabling all inbound and outbound Internet communication. This threat might temporarily affect business operations, but that would typically be much less impactful than an adversary deploying ransomware.
If a user call to the IT helpdesk identified the threat, there might be enough advance warning to take defensive measures to prevent or minimize the effects of the attack. If an external entity such as law enforcement or a financial institution identified the threat, it's likely that the damage is already done, and you'll see evidence in your environment that the threat actor has administrative control of your network. This evidence can range from ransomware notes, locked screens, or ransom demands.
#### What date/time did you first learn of the incident?
Establishing the initial activity date and time is important because it helps narrow the scope of the initial triage for quick wins by the attacker. Additional questions might include:
- What updates were missing on that date? It's important to understand what vulnerabilities might have been exploited by the adversary.
- What accounts were used on that date?
- What new accounts have been created since that date?
#### What logs are available, and is there any indication that the actor is currently accessing systems?
Logs - such as antivirus, EDR, and virtual private network (VPN)-are an indicator of suspected compromise. Follow-up questions might include:
- Are logs being aggregated in a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution-such as [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sentinel/), Splunk, ArcSight, and others-and current? What is the retention period of this data?
- Are there any suspected compromised systems that are experiencing unusual activity?
- Are there any suspected compromised accounts that appear to be actively used by the adversary?
- Is there any evidence of active command and controls (C2s) in EDR, firewall, VPN, web proxy, and other logs?
As part of assessing the current situation, you might need an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controller that was not compromised, a recent backup of a domain controller, or a recent domain controller taken offline for maintenance or upgrades. Also determine whether [multifactor authentication (MFA)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/mfa-multi-factor-authentication/) was required for everyone in the company and if [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) was used.
### Step 2: Identify the LOB apps that are unavailable due to the incident
This step is critical in figuring out the quickest way to get systems back online while obtaining the evidence required.
Does the application require an identity?
- How is authentication performed?
- How are credentials such as certificates or secrets stored and managed?
Are tested backups of the application, configuration, and data available?
- Are the contents and integrity of backups regularly verified using a restore exercise? This check is particularly important after configuration management changes or version upgrades.
### Step 3: Determine the compromise recovery process
This step might be necessary if you've determined that the control plane, which is typically AD DS, has been compromised.
Your investigation should always have a goal of providing output that feeds directly into the CR process. CR is the process that removes attacker control from an environment and tactically increase security posture within a set period. CR takes place post-security breach. To learn more about CR, read the Microsoft Compromise Recovery Security Practice team's [CRSP: The emergency team fighting cyber attacks beside customers](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/06/09/crsp-the-emergency-team-fighting-cyber-attacks-beside-customers/) blog article.
After gathering the responses to the questions in steps 1 and 2, you can build a list of tasks and assign owners. A key factor in a successful incident response engagement is thorough, detailed documentation of each work item (such as the owner, status, findings, date, and time), making the compilation of findings at the end of the engagement a straightforward process.
## DART recommendations and best practices
Here are DART's recommendations and best practices for containment and post-incident activities.
### Containment
Containment can only happen once you determine what needs to be contained. In the case of ransomware, the adversary's goal is to obtain credentials that allow administrative control over a highly available server and then deploy the ransomware. In some cases, the threat actor identifies sensitive data and exfiltrates it to a location they control.
Tactical recovery is unique for your organization's environment, industry, and level of IT expertise and experience. The steps outlined below are recommended for short-term and tactical containment steps your organization can take.
