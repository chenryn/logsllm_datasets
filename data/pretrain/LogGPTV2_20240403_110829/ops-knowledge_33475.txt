Assistant: This log chunk is related to the AirPort Link Down on awdl0, AppleCamIn, IO80211AWDLPeerManager, AddressBookSourceSync, and AppleThunderboltNHIType2. It begins with the AirPort Link Down on awdl0, followed by AppleCamIn and IO80211AWDLPeerManager setting the AWDL operation mode from AUTO to SUSPENDED. Then, com.apple.AddressBook.InternetAccountsBridge and AddressBookSourceSync have errors. After that, the kernel logs the previous sleep cause and ARPT for AirPort_Brcm43xx. Next, mDNSResponder and symptomsd have errors. Finally, AppleThunderboltNHIType2 powers up and IO80211AWDLPeerManager resumes AWDL, followed by com.apple.AddressBook.InternetAccountsBridge and sandboxd. The log ends with ARPT for AirPort_Brcm43xx enabling WWEN.
