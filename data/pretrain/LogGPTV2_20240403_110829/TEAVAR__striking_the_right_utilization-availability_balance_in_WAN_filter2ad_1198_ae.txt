historical time-series data of up/down status and are inherently
prone to estimation errors (more sophisticated techniques, e.g.,
based on machine-learning, can be applied).
To examine the effects of such inaccuracies, we use the following
methodology. We assume there is a set of probabilities that is the
ground-truth, so the actual performance of any TE solution should
be evaluated against these probabilities. In particular, we evalu-
ate two versions of TeaVaR: (i) TeaVaR using the ground-truth
probabilities; (ii) TeaVaR using a perturbed version of the ground-
truth probabilities (reflecting estimation errors). To generate (ii),
we assume a magnitude of noise n. The probabilities that are given
to TeaVaR as input are generated via ˜pz = pz + pznr, where r is
random noise, distributed uniformly on [−1, 1].
For each noise level in Table 3, we compare the percent error
of average throughput across all scenarios to that achieved using
the ground-truth probabilities. We observe that the noise has a

relatively small effect on the solution quality. For example, when
the perturbed probabilities are within 10% from the ground truth,
TeaVaR’s throughput is within 3% of the solution obtained with
the actual probabilities.
5.4 Sensitivity to Scenario Pruning
In Section 4.2 we described an efficient algorithm for pruning sce-
narios. We now elaborate on this algorithm and evaluate its impact
on performance and accuracy. Our first step is to see what per-
centage of the scenario space is being pruned by various cutoff
thresholds. The cutoff threshold is defined in Section 4. Fig. 12(a)
shows the probability mass of all scenarios remaining in the opti-
mization after a given cutoff. With modest cutoffs we are left with
a large portion, over 95% of the total space. Fig. 12(b) shows the
effect of pruning on accuracy. Specifically, we compare the result-
ing CVaR value with pruning to the case where we consider 100%
of the scenario space (“optimal”) using a standard error formula,
|CV aRβ,cutoff −CV aRβ,optimal |
. With a cutoff similar to that used in
the bulk of our experiments (10−4 for ATT and 10−5 for all other
topologies), we achieve high scenario coverage with less than 5%
error. It is important to note that the speed benefits of the cutoff
are substantial, as shown in Fig. 12(c). Using cutoff values reduces
the computation time from minutes (in the near-optimal case) to a
few tens of seconds, a plausible compute overhead for typical TE

6 DISCUSSION
We now discuss certain natural extensions of our framework, elab-
orate on its practical use-cases, and present limitations.
Contending with demand uncertainty. We have considered the
case of TE in the presence of failure events, but only for a fixed
set of (empirically-derived) demands. An important part of today’s
TE schemes is a component that predicts traffic demands based on
previously observed demands (see, e.g., [55]). State-of-the-art TE
solvers apply sophisticated techniques to predict traffic demands,
e.g., utilizing a combination of moving averages, decision forests,
and random walks. An alternative approach would be to formulate
the loss function in the joint probability space of both demands and
link failures (e.g., the demand di in (3) is a random variable). We
leave this to future work.
Estimating failure probabilities. TeaVaR takes as input the prob-
abilities of failure events. While we use basic machinery for esti-
mating failure probabilities from availability time series data, this is
not the main focus of our paper. Refined estimation techniques may
include a combination of learning failure patterns (e.g., diurnal) and
additional information from the IP layer [56] or physical layer [23].
Control plane failures. While our focus is on data plane failures
(including link failures caused by fiber cuts or hardware failures),
our risk-aware approach can be extended to control plane failures.
Indeed, resource allocation mechanisms for control plane failures
reflect similar worst-case provisioning approaches [43].
Scalability. Our current solution utilizes a simple and practical
technique for coping with an exponential number of network states
(see §5.4). Looking forward, as networks become larger, an impor-
tant future research direction will be to supplement our techniques
with approaches to “state space reduction”. These may include
incremental solving [18], sampling [12], and clustering.
Multiple service priorities. A possible approach for increasing
network utilization is sending background (scavenger) traffic over
links/routes with available bandwidth. This is orthogonal to our

work: even if the provider is able to utilize the extra capacity by
sending lower priority traffic, it is still required to provide availabil-
ity guarantees for high-priority traffic. Intuitively, our framework
allows for scaling down the provisioned capacity while maintaining
adequate availability levels; low-priority traffic can still be sent at
times when the network is not highly utilized. An interesting future
research direction is to incorporate multiple priority classes with
possibly different availability guarantees into our framework.
7 RELATED WORK
WAN traffic management. Optimizing WAN backbone traffic is
a well-researched challenge. Prior work includes optimizing OSPF
or IS-IS weights [22] and MPLS tunnels [19, 34], optimizing for bulk
data transfers using relay nodes [39], optimizing under inaccurate
knowledge of traffic demands [4, 38], and leveraging re-configurable
optical devices [32, 44]. These studies focus on optimizing band-
width allocation and disregard the possibility of failures. Recent
interest in centralized TE for WANs is driven by software-defined
approaches to running and optimizing such networks at scale (such
as SWAN [27], B4 [29], FFC [43], and BwE [37]). These schemes
exploit a global view of the network and perform global updates to
configure flow allocations.
Risk management in TE vs. risk-management in capacity
planning. Leveraging empirical data on failure probabilities to at-
tain higher availability has been proposed in the context of capacity
planning [5], i.e., the periodic augmentation of the WAN’s capacity.
However, capacity planning occurs on a much longer timescale
than TE (months, as opposed to minutes), and this does not allow
us to take into account timely information about failures (or the
prevailing demands). For example, [23] establishes that outages can
be predicted based on sudden drops in optical signal quality, with a
50% chance of an outage within an hour of a drop event and a 70%
chance of an outage within one day. Even if capacity planning is
informed by aggregated empirical statistics about failures, TeaVaR
can still harness empirical data on the current traffic pattern and
failure probabilities to optimize utilization and availability.
TE optimization vs. TE validation. [13] presents an optimiza-
tion framework for quantifying the worst-case performance of an
adaptive routing strategy provided as input. Thus, the framework
in [13] can be used to validate that a specific TE configuration meets
a certain performance goal under (input) variable demands and fail-
ure scenarios. Our aim, in contrast is to optimize the choice of TE
configuration.
More risk-aware networking. [47] proposes a TE framework
that takes into account demand uncertainty, as opposed to network
failures in our case, and risk is expressed in terms of standard
deviation. Consequently, the TE framework in [47] cannot enforce
a particular level of availability (say, 99.9%). In addition, the focus
in [47] is on offline TE and revenue. [11] analyzes the effects of
demand fluctuations and proposes a TE scheme that adjusts the
network topology in the long term and re-routes traffic in the
short term. This combine ideas from oblivious routing and dynamic
routing but do not consider failures. The impact of failures on
availability is studied in [25], but this relationship is not formalized.
Instead, [25] introduces design principles. Our findings agree with
these principles. Ghobadi et al. [23] study failures in Microsoft’s
WAN and propose that WAN TE should take into account data on
optical-layer performance, but do not provide a TE formulation
addressing this. [54] achieves failure recovery by dynamically re-
balancing traffic across paths after failures occur. This approach
does not consider failure probabilities. [40] and [17] present routing
algorithms for recovering from multiple failures in a probabilistic
model of link failures. The objective there is computing diverse
routes with minimum joint failure probability. These results are
orthogonal and complementary to ours. Indeed, TeaVaR could be
applied to tunnels computed in this manner (as with link-disjoint
paths, oblivious paths, etc.). [56] presents analytical models for the
dynamic estimation of failure risks and proposes accounting for
risk when computing routes in OSPF networks so that service level
agreement violations are minimized. Our formulation can be used
in tandem with the failure model in [56], as well as other failure
models from the literature, such as [46, 54].
Operations research perspective. The optimization of networks
that exhibit stochastic behavior has been studied in operations re-
search literature in different contexts (e.g., transportation, wireless
networks). The set of tools used to address uncertainty includes
stochastic and robust optimization [6, 9, 15, 24]. In addition, there
is a rich body of literature on CVaR following the seminal work
in [50]. Boginski et al. [12] apply CVaR to the minimum-cost flow
problem (MCF) under uncertain link availability. Importantly, [12]
introduces a CVaR-related constraint on the total loss, but since
it does not lead to per-commodity availability guarantees (as in
TeaVaR), it cannot be used to generate SLOs for individual network
users.
8 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Inspired by financial risk theory, we introduce a novel TE paradigm
that explicitly accounts for the likelihood of different failure events
with the goal of minimizing a formal notion of risk to a level deemed
acceptable by network operators. We design and evaluate TeaVaR,
a TE optimization framework that allows operators to optimize
bandwidth assignment subject to meeting a desired availability bar
(e.g., providing 99.9% availability). In our design, we address algo-
rithmic challenges related to the tractability of risk minimization
in our context, as well as operational challenges. We apply TeaVaR
to real-world data from the inter-datacenter backbone of a large
service provider in North America. Our results reveal that TeaVaR
can support up to twice as much traffic as today’s state-of-the-art
TE schemes at the same level of availability. TeaVaR illustrates the
usefulness of adopting the notion of Conditional Value at Risk to
network resource allocation challenges, and we believe that this ap-
proach might find other important applications in the networking
domain.
