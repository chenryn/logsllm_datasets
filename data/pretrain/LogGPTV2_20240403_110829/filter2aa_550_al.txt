### The FBI Investigation into the HUC Hack

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted an investigation into a 17-day hack of a California electric power grid test network, initiated by the Honker Union of China (HUC) on April 25th. This case was initially dismissed as media hype, but in 2007, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) informed industry leaders that such hacker threats to critical infrastructure were not only possible but had already occurred.

### Chinese Government's Role in Cyber Stand-Down

On the anniversary of this cyber incident, as businesses prepared for another round of potential hacking, it was reported that the Chinese government successfully called for a stand-down at the last minute. This suggests a higher degree of coordination among Chinese hackers compared to their American counterparts.

### Estonia 2007: A Nation-State Under Cyber Attack

On April 26, 2007, the Estonian government relocated a Soviet World War II memorial from the center of its capital to a military cemetery. This move incited public outrage both in Russia and among Estonia’s Russian minority. Starting on April 27, Estonian government, law enforcement, banking, media, and internet infrastructure endured three weeks of cyber attacks, which continue to attract significant international attention.

Estonians conduct over 98% of their banking transactions electronically. Consequently, the impact of multiple Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which severed all communications to the web presence of the country’s two largest banks for up to two hours and rendered international services partially unavailable for days, was substantial.

### Infrastructure Attacks and Propaganda

Less discussed but potentially more consequential were the attacks on internet infrastructure, specifically routers, which disrupted government communications for a brief period. Additionally, a hacker defaced the Estonian Prime Minister’s political party website, altering the homepage text to a fabricated government apology for moving the statue and a promise to return it to its original location.

### NATO and Article 5

Diplomatic interest in the Estonia case was high, partly due to the potential reinterpretation of NATO’s Article 5, which states that an armed attack against one Alliance member is considered an attack against all. Article 5 has been invoked only once, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. There is a possibility that it could be interpreted to include cyber attacks in the future.

### Strategic Implications of the Estonia Crisis

For many observers, the 2007 DDoS attacks on Estonia demonstrated a clear "business case" for cyber attacks against IT-dependent countries. This crisis significantly influenced the 2010 debate over NATO’s new Strategic Concept, elevating cyber security to a higher level of visibility in international security dialogue, alongside terrorism and ballistic missiles as primary threats to the Alliance.

### Summary of Part II

Part II of this book highlights the transformation of cyber security from a technical discipline to a strategic concept. The growing power of the Internet, the rapid development of hacker tools and tactics, and recent events suggest that cyber attacks will play an increasingly important, and perhaps leading, role in future international conflicts.

Since the Estonia crisis in 2007, this trend has shown no sign of slowing down:
- In 2007, the Israeli military reportedly conducted a cyber attack against Syrian air defense prior to destroying an alleged nuclear reactor.
- In 2008, the Russo-Georgian war demonstrated the close relationship between cyber and conventional operations in military campaigns.
- In 2009, during a domestic political crisis, hackers knocked the entire nation-state of Kyrgyzstan offline.
- In 2010, the Stuxnet worm was identified as the most sophisticated piece of malware examined by public researchers, likely developed by a state sponsor.

### Future Directions for National Security

National security leadership must dramatically increase its understanding of the technology, law, and ethics related to cyber attack and defense to competently integrate cyber conflict, terrorism, and warfare into national security planning.

### Part III: Nation-State Cyber Attack Mitigation Strategies

Part III of this book will examine four strategies that nation-states are likely to adopt to mitigate the threat of cyber attacks and improve their national cyber defense posture:
- The next-generation Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
- Application of Sun Tzu’s Art of War to cyber warfare
- Cyber attack deterrence
- Cyber arms control

### Next Generation Internet: Is IPv6 the Answer?

First and foremost, governments will seek to enhance strategic cyber security through improved technology. The most promising candidate is IPv6, the new "language" of networks. Due to its vast number of viable computer addresses and enhanced security features, many nations view IPv6 as crucial for their future national security plans. However, the high learning curve has led many government agencies and large businesses to miss deadlines for IPv6 compliance.

### IPv6 Address Space and Security

IPv4, the current language of the Internet, will run out of available IP addresses in 2011, particularly affecting the developing world. IPv6 offers a solution with 128-bit addresses, creating 340 undecillion IPs, or 50 octillion for every human on Earth. IPv6 also includes more powerful IP headers, supporting advanced features like telematics, which can connect household appliances to the Internet.

IPv6 was designed to provide better security than IPv4, with built-in mechanisms like IP Security (IPSec) to reduce vulnerabilities to spoofing, traffic sniffing, and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. The astronomical number of IP addresses may make random scanning and self-propagating worms less effective. However, IPv6 is not invulnerable to traditional attack methods, and software vulnerabilities will persist regardless of the protocol used.

### Transition Challenges and Privacy Concerns

The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 presents several challenges. During the long transition period, hackers will exploit vulnerabilities in both protocols. The complexity of managing more devices, network interface cards, and code stacks will increase, and some IPv6 traffic will be tunneled within IPv4 packets.

From a privacy perspective, IPv6's end-to-end connectivity and strong encryption offer benefits, but the loss of Network Address Translation (NAT) makes it easier for third parties to track communication patterns. NAT provided some privacy by making IP addresses temporary, and its loss raises concerns about government surveillance and the suppression of political dissent.

### Uneven Worldwide Deployment

Many governments are not waiting for these debates to be settled. In a network-centric world, future Internet technologies like IPv6 cannot be ignored. Nations and businesses risk falling behind peers, competitors, and enemies. Therefore, numerous governments have set deadlines for various levels of IPv6 compliance. For example, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandated that U.S. government agencies be "IPv6 compliant" by June 30, 2008, though the goals were limited.

In conclusion, while IPv6 holds promise for improving overall Internet security, the transition phase will be characterized by increased security risks. The long-term impact on attackers and defenders in cyberspace remains to be seen.
