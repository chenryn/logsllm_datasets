The FBI investigated a Honker Union of China (HUC), 17-day hack of a California 
electric power grid test network that began on April 25th.277 The case was widely 
dismissed as media hype at the time, but the CIA informed industry leaders in 2007 
that not only is a tangible hacker threat to such critical infrastructure possible, it in 
fact has already happened.278
On the anniversary of this cyber war, as businesses were bracing for another round 
of hacking, the Chinese government is said to have successfully called for a stand-
down at the last minute, suggesting that Chinese hackers may share a greater de-
gree of coordination than their American counterparts.279
Estonia 2007: Targeting a Nation-State
On April 26, 2007, the Estonian government moved a Soviet World War II memo-
rial from the center of its capital to a military cemetery. The move inflamed public 
opinion both in Russia and among Estonia’s Russian minority population. Beginning 
on April 27, Estonian government, law enforcement, banking, media, and Internet 
infrastructure endured three weeks of cyber attacks, whose impact still generates 
immense interest from governments around the world.
Estonians conduct over 98% of their banking via electronic means. Therefore, the 
impact of multiple Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which severed all 
communications to the Web presence of the country’s two largest banks for up to 
two hours and rendered international services partially unavailable for days at a 
time, is obvious.
Less widely discussed, but likely of greater consequence – both to national security 
planners and to computer network defense personnel – were the Internet infrastruc-
ture (router) attacks on one of the Estonian government’s ISPs, which disrupted 
government communications for a “short” period of time.280

Cyber Security: Real-World Impact
On the propaganda front, a hacker defaced the Estonian Prime Minister’s political 
party website, changing the homepage text to a fabricated government apology for 
having moved the statue, along with a promise to move it back to its original loca-
tion.
Diplomatic interest in the Estonia case was high, in part due to the possible reinter-
pretation of NATO’s Article 5, which states that “an armed attack against one [Alli-
ance member]... shall be considered an attack against them all.”281 Article 5 has been 
invoked only once, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Potentially, 
it could one day be interpreted to encompass cyber attacks as well.
For many observers, the 2007 denial-of-service attacks in Estonia demonstrated a 
clear “business case” cyber attack model against an IT-dependent country. The crisis 
significantly influenced the 2010 debate over NATO’s new Strategic Concept, when 
cyber security assumed a much higher level of visibility in international security 
dialogue, ranking alongside terrorism and ballistic missiles as a primary threat to 
the Alliance.282
To summarize Part II of this book, the world has witnessed the transformation of 
cyber security from a technical discipline to a strategic concept. The growing power 
of the Internet, the rapid development of hacker tools and tactics, and clear-cut ex-
amples from current events suggest that cyber attacks will play an increasingly 
important, and perhaps a lead role, in future international conflicts.
Since the Estonia crisis in 2007, this trend shows no sign of slowing down:
• in 2007, the Israeli military is reported to have conducted a cyber attack against 
Syrian air defense prior to its destruction of an alleged nuclear reactor;283
• in 2008, many analysts argued that the Russo-Georgian war demonstrated 
that there will be a close relationship between cyber and conventional opera-
tions in all future military campaigns;284
• in 2009, during a time of domestic political crisis, hackers knocked the entire 
nation-state of Kyrgyzstan offline;285 and
• in 2010, the Stuxnet worm was believed to be the most sophisticated piece of 
malware yet examined by public researchers and is widely assumed to have 
been written by a state sponsor.286

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
Therefore, national security leadership has no choice but to dramatically increase its 
level of understanding of the technology, law, and ethics related to cyber attack and 
defense so that it can competently factor cyber conflict, terrorism and warfare into 
all stages of national security planning.
Part III of this book will examine four strategies that nation-states are likely to adopt 
as they seek to mitigate the threat of cyber attacks and attempt to improve their 
national cyber defense posture.

Next Generation Internet: Is IPv6 the Answer?
III. NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK 
MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Part II of this book examined the advent of cyber security as a strategic concept. 
Part III will evaluate four likely strategies that governments will employ to mitigate 
the cyber attack threat: the “next-generation” Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), an 
application of the world’s best military doctrine (Sun Tzu’s Art of War) to cyber war-
fare, cyber attack deterrence, and cyber arms control.
5. NEXT GENERATION INTERNET: IS IPV6 THE 
ANSWER?287
First and foremost, governments will seek to reach a higher level of strategic cyber 
security through improved technology. And the most likely candidate to have an 
effect at the strategic level is a sleeping giant – the new “language” of networks, 
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).
In fact, due to its stellar number of viable computer addresses and its enhanced 
security features, many nations view IPv6 as crucial to their national security plans 
for the future. However, its high learning curve has led myriad government agencies 
and large businesses to miss deadlines for IPv6 compliance.
A different perspective is offered by some human rights organizations, which fear 
that the “next-generation” Internet will have adverse effects on individual privacy 
and online anonymity.
Regarding IPv6 security, a key point to understand is that, during the long transi-
tion period from IPv4 to IPv6, hackers will be able to exploit vulnerabilities in both 
languages at once.
IPv6 Address Space
IPv4, the current language of the Internet, will run out of available IP addresses – or 
“space” from which one can connect to the Internet – in 2011. The address shortage 
is especially acute in the developing world, which connected to the Internet after 
most IP addresses had already been allocated or bought.288
287 This chapter was co-authored with Alexander Eisen.

88
NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
IPv6 decisively answers the need for more IP addresses. IPv4 has around four bil-
lion, which seemed like a lot when the protocol was written in the early 1980s, but 
is insufficient today. IPv6, developed in the late 1990s, has 128-bit addresses, which 
create 340 undecillion IPs,289 or 50 octillion for every human on Earth.290
As an added bonus, IPv6 employs much more powerful IP “headers,” or internal 
management data, which allow for more advanced features and customization than 
with IPv4. IPv6 headers will be used to support “telematics,” the integrated use of 
telecommunications and informatics. Since IPv6 will allow practically everything, 
including common household appliances, to be connected to the Internet, its advo-
cates argue that telematics will provide more convenient, economical, and entertain-
ing lifestyles.291
Improved Security?
But the most important aspect of IPv6 for this research is that it was designed to 
provide better security than IPv4.292 The goal was to build security into the protocol 
itself. Thirty years ago, IPv4 defeated more feature-rich rivals precisely because IP 
was a “dumb” protocol. It lacked sophistication, but was simple, resilient, and easy 
to implement and maintain. The problem was that IPv4’s lack of intrinsic security 
left it open to misuse.
Today, a better network protocol is needed, both for size and for security. IPv6 offers 
clear security upgrades over IPv4. First, IPv6 is much more cryptography-friendly. 
A mechanism called IP Security (IPSec) is built directly into the protocol’s “code 
stack.” IPSec should reduce Internet users’ vulnerability to spoofing,293 illicit traffic 
sniffing294 and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.295
IPv6 also offers end-to-end connectivity, which is afforded by the incredibly high 
number of IP addresses available. Since it is possible, in theory, to give anything 
an IP address, any two points on the Internet may communicate directly with each 
other.
289 Or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible addresses.
290 An IPv4 address looks like this: 207.46.19.60. IPv6 is much longer: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:00
00:1428:57ab (or, for short, 2001:0db8::1428:57ab).
291 Godara, 2010: The term telematics often refers to automation in automobiles, such as GPS navigation, 
hands-free cell phones, and automatic driving assistance systems.
292 Hagen, 2002.
293 Spoofing means impersonating another computer user or program.
294 Passively collecting network data, with or without appropriate approval.
295 This is when an attacker secretly controls both sides of a conversation. The victims think they are 
speaking with one another directly, for example, by email, when in fact they are not.
89
Next Generation Internet: Is IPv6 the Answer?
These upgrades should have numerous follow-on benefits. For example, the astro-
nomical number of IP addresses may mean that attackers will no longer be able to 
randomly “scan” the Internet to find their victims. In addition, the Internet should be 
more resistant to self-propagating worms.296
To improve strategic cyber security across the Internet, any successor to IPv4 
should have a greater focus on structure and logic (e.g., Internet navigation, data 
packet routing, IP address allocation). Fortunately, with IPv6, this is the case. The 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created the first IPv6 Forum in 1999; today 
there are IPv6-specific Task Forces worldwide, which still have the opportunity to 
make tangible improvements in the next-generation protocol as it evolves.
IPv6 Answers Some Questions, Creates Others
In spite of these promising characteristics, it is unlikely that IPv6 will end cyber at-
tacks in the future. Hackers have already demonstrated that IPv6 is not invulnerable 
to many traditional, IPv4 attack methods, including DoS,297 packet crafting,298 and 
MITM attacks.299 Vulnerabilities in software (operating systems, network services, 
web applications) will continue to exist, no matter which protocol they use.300 And 
perhaps most crucially, although IPSec is available, it is not required.301
As an analogy, the history of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)302 does not bode well 
for IPv6. The high cost and resource-intensive nature of PKI pose challenges to most 
organizations, and in the future, the same dynamic could hamper the large-scale 
deployment of IPSec in IPv6.
False identities are often assumed by stealing or creating fraudulent ID cards or 
other documents. Via the Internet, attackers will still attempt to use hacked comput-
ers as “proxies” for nefarious activity, even in the IPv6 era. The case of Stuxnet has 
296 Popoviciu et al, 2006.
297 E.g., Smurf6, Rsmurf6, Redir6, connection flooding, and stealing all available addresses.
298 This refers to manually creating network data packets instead of using default or existing network 
traffic characteristics.
299 Or “man-in-the-middle” attacks, e.g., Parasite6, Fake_router6.
300 In fact, the majority of attacks today may not involve eavesdropping on or manipulating the traffic on 
a network wire. A compromised application, for example, could exfiltrate stolen information equally 
well via either the IPv4 or the IPv6 code stack.
301 It is also important to note that the improved IP header still does not travel across the Internet en-
crypted, but in the clear.
302 This refers to the management of digital certificates. PKI uses asymmetric cryptography to create 
an electronic identity. Internet services are increasingly using it, and this should lower the risk of 
identity theft, but Stuxnet has shown that PKI is not a silver bullet.
90
NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
shown that, even with PKI safeguards, it is possible to steal digital identities that al-
low a hacker to run computer code as if it were installed by a trustworthy company.
And of course, the next-generation Internet will spawn next-generation attacks. For 
example, if IPv6 precludes network vulnerability scanning, hackers may increas-
ingly target Certificate Authorities (CA) and Domain Name Servers (DNS). In fact, a 
successful compromise of a DNS server may be required for an attacker to acquire 
detailed knowledge of a target Local Area Network (LAN).303
The necessarily long transition period will provide its own set of challenges. The 
most important is that, as the world uses both IP languages at once, hackers will 
have an increased “attack surface.” There will simply be a higher number of vulner-
abilities to exploit as computer security personnel are forced to defend a larger 
network space within their enterprise.
The level of complexity will rise as system administrators manage more devices per 
enterprise, more network interface cards (NIC) per device, and more code “stacks” 
or data structures per NIC. Furthermore, some network data will be “native” or IPv6-
only, but other IPv6 traffic will be “tunneled” or shuttled across the Internet within 
IPv4 carrier packets.
Such a new and complex environment may allow some cyber attacks to slip through 
myriad cracks in cyber defense architecture. In fact, this may already be the case 
on countless networks, given that modern devices and operating systems are often 
IPv6-enabled by default.
The opposite is true for computer network defense. For example, even in the latest 
version of the world’s most popular intrusion detection software, called “Snort,” IPv6 
awareness is not enabled by default, but must be specifically turned on by a security 
analyst.304 The likely result is a serious blind spot in global network traffic analysis.
Consider the “auto-configuration” aspect of IPv6. Its intended function is to ease 
and increase mobility through enhanced, ad hoc network associations. This appears 
to be an exciting part of the world’s future networking paradigm. However, auto-
configuration would also seem to greatly complicate the task of tracking network-
enabled devices that enter and leave enterprise boundaries.
303 If DNS attacks are successful in the IPv6 era, the overall trend toward client-side exploits – those 
which target the end user – should continue.

Next Generation Internet: Is IPv6 the Answer?
Privacy Concerns
From a law enforcement and national security perspective, there is worldwide inter-
est in the implications of IPv6 for online privacy and anonymity, which will have a 
tangible impact on relations between government and civil society.
IPv6 security, specifically in the form of IPsec, contains a potential paradox. Users 
gain end-to-end connectivity with peers and acquire strong encryption to obscure 
the content of their communications, but the loss of Network Address Translation 
(NAT) means that it is easier for third parties to see who is communicating with 
whom. Even if an eavesdropper is not able to read encrypted content, “traffic analy-
sis” – or the deduction of information content by analyzing communication patterns 
– should be easier than with IPv4.
NAT allows multiple users to connect to the Internet from one IP address. It almost 
single-handedly saved IPv4 from address depletion for many years.305 Further, NAT 
provides Internet users with some “security through obscurity” by making IP ad-
dresses temporary and not permanently associated with a human user. This charac-
teristic offers a small but tangible amount of Internet privacy.
Critics of NAT claim that it is labor-intensive, expensive, and unnecessary, but others 
worry that its loss will come at the expense of privacy. For example, Chinese Internet 
Society chairwoman Hu Qiheng told the New York Times in 2006 that “there is now 
anonymity for criminals on the Internet in China ... with the China Next Generation 
Internet project, we will give everyone a unique identity on the Internet.”306
The simple reasoning behind Qiheng’s thinking is that IPv6 could facilitate the direct 
association of a permanent IP address to a particular Internet user. For law enforce-
ment, end-to-end connectivity may help to solve the vexing “attribution” problem of 
cyber attacks, in which hackers are able to remain anonymous. But human rights 
groups fear that governments will use this new power to quash political dissent.
This open question is serious enough that, in the future, various national IPv6 im-
plementations may be incongruous or even incompatible with one another, as differ-
ent network configurations are used for different purposes.
IPv6 “privacy extensions” were designed to address this problem by making it pos-
sible for a user to acquire somewhat random, temporary IP addresses in order to 
surf the web with greater privacy and security. Only time will tell whether IPv6 
privacy extensions work in practice. Since IPv6 is just now being broadly deployed, 
305 IPv4’s lifespan was also extended by coding other aspects of IPv6, such as IPSec, into IPv4.
306 Crampton, 2006.
92
NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
many of its advanced features have not been subjected to sufficient testing or secu-
rity analysis.307
In 2011, it is still unknown whether the IPv6 era will favor attackers or defenders 
in cyberspace. In the long-run, it is possible that the new protocol’s benefits will be 
good for overall Internet security. However, it is a near certainty that the long transi-
tion phase from IPv4 to IPv6 will be characterized by increased security risks.
Uneven Worldwide Deployment
Many governments are not waiting for this debate to be settled. In a network-centric 
world, future Internet technologies such as IPv6 cannot be ignored. A government’s 
ability to conduct national security-related operations may depend on them one day. 
Nations and businesses risk falling behind peers, competitors, and enemies. Thus, 
numerous governments have set deadlines for various levels of IPv6 compliance.
In the United States, the Executive Branch Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
mandated that U.S. government agencies be “IPv6 compliant” by June 30, 2008. 
However, compliance in this case had very limited goals.308 Furthermore, the OMB
