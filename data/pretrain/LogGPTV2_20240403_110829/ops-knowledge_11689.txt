User: As if for now, we are using datastore blob to store profile images of our site. And there is restriction in Datastore for storing more than 1mb file as a blob in datastore. Is there any work around for this.
Assistant: You could work around this by splitting the blob into multiple pieces and storing them in separate entities. What you should do, though, is use the Blobstore as @Thilo suggests.
