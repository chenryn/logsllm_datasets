1.  [Click on the Create button at the very top of the page. Slide down
    to Site. You have seven sections to consider for optimal scanning
    and performance.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0021}
2.  [The General Tab is where you can name the site for future reference
    and reporting. Add the name TEST.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0022}
3.  [The Assets Tab will allow you to enter a single name, address, or
    CIDR range of IP addresses you would like to scan. In the community
    version, it may be wise to do an nmap scan first to build an
    inventory and then bring in those assets individually since you\'re
    limited to 32 assets. For this TEST site, add your IP address. If
    you are unsure of your IP address, open up a command prompt and do
    an ipconfig /all.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0023}
4.  [The Authentication tab gives you the ability to be authorized to
    scan those assets listed on the Assets tab. If you would like a
    deeper scan, use administrator credentials on this page. Skip this
    the first time and you will have the ability to create a baseline
    comparison report in the future.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0024}
5.  [There are several scan templates on the next tab to choose from.
    The default scan template is a full audit without web spidering.
    This is an ideal template to use first.]{#c04.xhtml#c04-li-0025}

You now have a picture of how an attacker might see you and your
network. This is exactly the methodology attackers would use to find the
landscape of your environment and attempt to exploit what they find. If
you can thwart their efforts by closing up the vulnerabilities that are
exposed to the world, you will have a much safer ecosystem.

WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS CHAPTER:
-   [Log‐Based Intrusion Detection Systems]{#c05.xhtml#c05-li-0001}
-   [Agents]{#c05.xhtml#c05-li-0002}
-   [Log Analysis]{#c05.xhtml#c05-li-0003}
Open Source Security (OSSEC) is a free, open‐source, host‐based
intrusion detection system (HIDS). Daniel Cid, the author of OSSEC,
often refers to it in the log analysis portion of OSSEC as a *log‐based
intrusion detection system* (LIDS). Log analysis for intrusion detection
is the process of using the recorded events to detect attacks on a
specific environment.
With the proper agents installed on your assets and logs being processed
by OSSEC, you meet the criteria for another CIS control. CIS Control 6
is the maintenance, monitoring, and analysis of logs. You must ensure
that logging is enabled locally on your systems and it is actively being
monitored. Sometimes logging is the only record or evidence of a
successful attack. Without solid logs, an attack may go undetected, and
damage can be ongoing for months, if not years. Not only can a LIDS
protect against an external threat, it also can protect against an
internal threat such as detecting a user who is violating an acceptable
use policy (AUP).

## Log‐Based Intrusion Detection Systems {#c05.xhtml#head-2-39}
On your hosts across your network, it is vital to monitor the current
state of a machine, check the files that are stored on that machine (the
log files), and check to make sure that these files have not been
changed. OSSEC operates on the principle that attackers who are
successful at exploiting a vulnerability and []{#c05.xhtml#Page_58
.pagebreak title="58" role="doc-pagebreak"}have gained access to a
machine will leave evidence of their activities. Once attackers gain
access to a system, they of course will not want to lose access. Some
attackers will establish some type of backdoor that allows them to
return, bypassing all security you may have in place. A computer system
should be able to detect these modifications and find persistent threats
that penetrate firewalls and other network intrusion systems.
OSSEC is a security log analysis tool and is not known to be useful for
log management. It will store the alerts but not every single log. You
should have another mechanism for log storage if you need to store logs
for your internal security policies or compliance. If you choose to use
OSSEC as a HIDS, you will be using a database to monitor file system
objects. OSSEC can remember size, attributes, and dates as well as a
hash of contents on a machine. For example, if integrity is the most
important aspect of file monitoring, an MD5sum hash will use an
algorithm to create a digital fingerprint of the file.
With any new project/program implementation, there comes a need for
current evaluation. Your team needs to define what success will look
like, analyze your current situation, start with a few key components,
and take a look at your incident response (IR) plan. An IR plan will
contain policies, procedures, and guidelines surrounding processes to
complete if an unplanned event occurs.
The benefits to using OSSEC is that it is an open‐source free tool that
doesn\'t require a lot of hardware. This HIDS tool will give you
visibility into logs generated by firewalls, applications, servers, and
routers. You also gain visibility to encrypted protocols such as SSH and
SSL logs.
A challenge with OSSEC is it focuses on reactive remediation, reacting
to an event that already occurred rather than proactive remediation,
where you mitigate and remediate the issue before it occurs. Another
challenge you may face is "alert fatigue." This happens when a system
floods you with alerts hundreds of times to an event or incident. These
can be managed with log correlation and fine‐tuning.
OSSEC can be used to monitor thousands of servers with OSSEC agents.
These will be monitored by the OSSEC manager.
OSSEC is fairly easy to install, is easy to customize, is extremely
scalable, and can use many different platforms, including Windows,
Solaris, Mac, and Linux. Secure by default, there are hundreds of rules
that can be used straight out of the box. One of the key benefits to
OSSEC is how it helps customers meet specific compliance requirements
such as those in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It lets users
detect and alert on a file system modification that was unauthorized or
if there is any malicious behavior in any log files. If your
organization does have to subscribe to a compliance like PCI, you have
to implement only one primary function per server to prevent functions
that require different security levels from co‐existing on the same
server. Web servers, database servers, and []{#c05.xhtml#Page_59
.pagebreak title="59" role="doc-pagebreak"}DNS should be implemented on
separate servers. A database, which needs to have strong security
measures in place, would be at risk sharing a server with a web
application, which needs to be open and directly face the Internet. Each
server may generate its own unique type of logs, and that may require
some configuration of OSSEC. In [Figure
5.1](#c05.xhtml#c05-fig-0001){#c05.xhtml#R_c05-fig-0001}, you see the
process that OSSEC will use to gather, analyze, and possibly alert you
to activity.
![[**[Figure 5.1](#c05.xhtml#R_c05-fig-0001){#c05.xhtml#c05-fig-0001
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} The collection of data from
agents analyzed and possibly generating
alerts](Images/c05f001.jpg){.center width="744" height="248"}
The log analysis flow for the client/server/agent architecture begins
with the collection of logs from the assets that need monitoring. After
the logs are collected, generic information is extracted such as
hostname, program name, and time from the syslog header.
The OSSEC is a virtual appliance based on CentOS and includes Elastic
search‐Logstash‐Kibana (ELK). It comes with its own library of log
decoders that will be used by default. These decoders can parse or
analyze the logs from Windows, SSH, or Apache using default tags within
the logs that help identify what they are and where they came from. The
decoders in OSSEC are written in XML and organized into libraries to
make them easy to open, decode, define, and close. As you see in [Figure
5.2](#c05.xhtml#c05-fig-0002){#c05.xhtml#R_c05-fig-0002}, the virtual
appliance spins up ready for you to begin interacting with the
dashboard, libraries, and parsing data.
![[**[Figure 5.2](#c05.xhtml#R_c05-fig-0002){#c05.xhtml#c05-fig-0002
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} The OSSEC
appliance](Images/c05f002.jpg){.center width="751" height="452"}
OSSEC must first understand what is in a log before it can tell you if
something is wrong or alert you to an event. After parsing the log and
normalizing the data, it will match fingerprint with fingerprint and
syntax with syntax, forwarding the log file to be evaluated by the rules
for processing. If OSSEC receives a log that it doesn\'t understand, it
will generate an event 1002, "Unknown problem somewhere on the system,"
as you see in [Figure
5.3](#c05.xhtml#c05-fig-0003){#c05.xhtml#R_c05-fig-0003}. One of the
best solutions is to configure some type of trigger that lists a unique
field in the log so it\'s no longer unknown.

role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} An OSSEC 1002
alert](Images/c05f003.jpg){.center width="751" height="123"}
Straight out of the box, there is an extensive set of rules embedded in
OSSEC. The rules themselves can be correlated and grouped. After
decoding the log, the next step is to check the rules. The rules are
internally stored in a tree‐type []{#c05.xhtml#Page_60 .pagebreak
title="60" role="doc-pagebreak"}structure and allow you to match on
user‐defined expressions based on the decoded information. There are
more than 400 rules available by default. Please do not modify the
default rules inside OSSEC as they will be written over when you
upgrade.
There are two basic types of rules: atomic and composite. Atomic rules
are based on a single event occurring, while a composite rule is based
on patterns across multiple logs. When you\'re learning to write rules,
it requires a rule ID, a level that is a number between 0 and 15, and a
pattern. For example, if a log is decoded as SSH, generate rule 123. If
you want to add a secondary rule, it will be dependent on the first. You
can add more rules to be called if the second one matches; for example,
you can specify whether the IP address comes from inside or outside the
network. Be careful---don\'t write new rules dependent on composite
rules. You should look at the original atomic rule that the composite
rule is based on.

can generate thousands of alerts a day and, if misconfigured, in a much
shorter period of time. You must tune your instance or else you will
start to ignore these alerts. Make sure your alerts are relatively rare
