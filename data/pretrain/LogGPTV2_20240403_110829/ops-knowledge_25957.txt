User: Can someone please show me how to get cherrypy to work with Google App Engine, I have made applications with cherrypys built in server, but I have no idea how to make an app that works with WSGI and GAE.
I have read the documentation for cherrypy and GAE but can't find anything. And I would prefer cherrypy to the webapp2 which is in the GAE example.
Assistant: The problem was that cherrypy was not in the root of the working directory, all of which I uploaded with the app engine tool. Not 100% sure if its the correct way to use GAE but it works.
