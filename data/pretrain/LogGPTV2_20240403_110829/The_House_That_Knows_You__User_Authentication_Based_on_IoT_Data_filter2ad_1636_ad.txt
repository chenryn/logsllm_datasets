Table 8: Confusion matrix for the same ensemble model as in Table 7, but with 5 users.
Behavioral authentication in other contexts has also been
studied. Freeman et al. [11] designed an ML approach for
clustering logins based on their IP, geolocation, browser,
and time, for authenticating users to online services. Device
fingerprinting has been used to augment user authentication
on the web [4].
Authorization and access policy frameworks in the IoT
systems have also been an active research area. He et al. [14]
conducted a survey of IoT device authorization preferences
and observed that most devices have limited authorization
flexibility. ContexIoT [15] is a permission system for IoT apps
that provides users contextual information to enable them
to make better access control decisions. SmartAuth [28]
generates a user interface for authorization decisions in
IoT apps. Soteria [8] performs static analysis to identify if
IoT apps respect security policies. IoTGUARD dynamically
enforces security policies in IoT devices based on monitoring
event handlers by IoT apps [9].
There have been prior work investigating user authenti-
cation in the smart home environments. Emami-Naeini et
al. [21] perform a user study on IoT privacy and demonstrate
that users are not comfortable with biometric data collection
in IoT settings. Biometric based authentication is optional in
Alexa [2], but this is prone to recording and replay attacks.
Shi et al. [24] proposed an authentication system leveraging
physical properties of WiFi signal generated by IoT devices.
Apthorpe et al. [5] show that user actions can be inferred
from encrypted network traffic generated by IoT devices. In
this work, we utilize the network communication statistics

model re-training and analyze user behavior over time as
IoT devices evolve. Another research direction would be in-
vestigating the performance of the models in the presence
of multiple active users in the smart home.
The behavioral authentication scores computed by our
authentication modules could be applied in various settings.
More importantly, they open up the possibility of creating
flexible policies for authorization and access control, and
replace today’s rigid, fixed policies. We believe that our work
opens up new research avenues in this direction, and this is
a topic of interest in our future work.

the sensitivity of the service.
7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We propose a novel user authentication method by analyzing
HTTPS network traffic generated by home-based IoT devices.
We conduct a user study and experiment with several ML
algorithms using features extracted from network traffic
with the goal of classifying users from a known set of users.
We showed that random forest and gradient boosting models
perform well in this setting and obtain high accuracy at user
classification. Moreover, an ensemble of two models can
increase the confidence of classification, at the expense of
abstaining to produce a score when the models produce
different predictions.
We also tested several deep neural network (DNN) ar-
chitectures, including feed-forward neural networks and
LSTMs. We did not include the details in the paper, as the
accuracy of these models was not comparable with that of
gradient boosting, random forest, and our two-model en-
semble. The best F1 score for a feed-forward architecture
was 0.54 and for LSTM 0.51, whereas our gradient boosting
achieves an F1 score of 0.86. We suspect the reason is be-
cause we have a relatively limited labeled dataset available
for model training. While in principle it is possible to con-
duct the user study over longer periods of time, we found it
challenging to recruit and retain users over time.
In a practical deployment, we envision that the ML model
for user classification is continuously re-trained with new
behavioral data over time. This is particularly important as
new IoT devices are added to the smart home and users
slowly shift their interests over time. Again, a longer-term
