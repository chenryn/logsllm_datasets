associated, with each subject’s case on a particular day having likely
different days when they were infected. Reducing the window size
merely reduces the distribution of these lags, enabling us to observe
a better correlation at the mean lag. We use a 15-day window of
demand and growth rate ratio (GR) of cases, and cross correlate
it to find the lag. Cross correlation allows us to shift the demand

Limitations. This part of our study has limitations, some inher-
ited from the original study [4]. First, as we focus on the relationship
between CDN demand and case growth rate, our study does not
account for the role of other potentially mitigating factors (e.g.,
mask wearing and handwashing) that could have contributed to the
observed decline in cases. Second, changes in CDN demand data
do not differentiate the reasons for such changes (e.g., connectivity
problems, exercising or low-risk trips). Although these topics are
outside the scope of our work, they are critical to an understanding
of the risk of COVID-19 infections. Third, as Badr et al. [4] we use
GR as a representative metric of the degree of transmission among
local populations; future work should explore replacing this vari-
able with other transmission indexes used in epidemiology. Fourth,
although the analysis focused on 25 counties, which might be a
biased sample of locations, we believe these locations accurately
capture the relationship between CDN demand and case growth
rates. The consistency of the correlations found at the state level
(counties in the same state) increases confidence in our results.
6 UNIVERSITY CAMPUS CLOSURES
Some social distancing NPI, such as shelter-at-home and closing
of non-essential businesses, results in changes to intra-region or
intra-county mobility which are well captured by the Google CMR
data and its categories (e.g., retail). We have shown that increased
social distancing, as captured by this mobility data, is correlated
with CDN demand (§4), and that CDN demand as a proxy of social
distancing is related to growth rates of infection (§5).
Despite some prior work on the effectiveness of school closures
in reducing the spread of viral respiratory illnesses (e.g., [3, 13]), the
value of this NPI is still disputed. In this section, we use university
campus closures in large college towns in the US3, to understand
the applicability of CDN demand in evaluating the effectiveness of
interventions that result in inter-region mobility.
The closure of university campuses results in a different type of
mobility which, we expect will have a very different relationship
with demand. As campuses close and people potentially relocate
outside the region, one would expect to see a correlated drop in
demand (rather than an increase, as when people stay home). For
this analysis, we focus on the 20 biggest college towns [29] (and
their counties), with metro areas between 100,000 and 1 million
people, and under 100,000 people (we do not include towns with
over 1 million people, as large metro includes multiple schools).
The percentage of the population made up of students at these
3College towns are communities, often a separate town or city, where students make
up a significant share of the population [35].

places ranges between 21.4% (Alachua, FL) and 71.8% (Clay, SD).4
We excluded Vincennes University (Vincennes, IN) from the list as
we were not able to gather network data for its campus.
Following prior work on the analysis of the potential benefits
of school closure we use daily COVID-19 incidence per 100,000
residents in each county [3]. We estimate COVID-19 incidence
using publicly available data from the Johns Hopkins University
CSSE COVID-19 repository [41]. The denominator for the inci-
dence measure was the county population from the 2018 American
Community Survey [65].
We focus on days before and after the second closing of uni-
versity campuses, around the Thanksgiving holiday of November
26th, 2020. The first set of university campus closures happen very
early in the pandemic with the University of Washington, the first
university closing its campus in the US, announcing its move to
online classes on March 6th, 2020 [62]. Given that it was only by
the end of March that every state had reported COVID-19 infection
cases and that, at that point, the maximum number of confirmed

the reported figures. While population and enrollment numbers have changed, the
fraction of the county population corresponding to the student body remains similar.
494
cases among the set of studied counties was only 8 [21], we do not
expect to see a significant impact of these measures [14].
For each campus, we separate demand originated from networks
belonging to the school from that of other networks, and related to
the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county. Figure 4
uses the campuses of University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
(UIUC), Cornell University, the University of Michigan and Ohio
University, as examples. Note that different schools report either
the End of Fall term or End of In-Person Classes which we use to
label these figures.
UIUC is a public land-grant research university in Illinois, located
in the twin cities of Champaign and Urbana, with an enrollment of
over 44,000 students, representing ≈ 22% of the population for the
county. Cornell University is a private institution in New York state
with an enrollment of 24,000, representing ≈ 32% of the Tomkins
County population. The University of Michigan is another large
public institution with 76,000 students, representing ≈ 21% of the
population of Washtenaw County. The Ohio University, located in
Athens, Ohio, is a relatively small public university with a student
enrollment of 25,000, but comprising a large fraction of the total
county population, ≈ 38%.
As the figure shows, in all cases lagged school CDN demand is
closely related to the drop in confirmed COVID-19 cases, suggesting
the effectiveness of the measure at controlling the spread of the
infection. In the cases of UIUC, cases drop rapidly from a peak
right at the time of in-person class ending. At Tomkins County, the
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases up to the end of
the Fall term and drops, together with school network demand on
the CDN after closing of campus. Appendix A.3 shows the complete
set of plots for all 19 college-town campuses.
Table 3 shows the distance correlation between both school
(network) and non-school lagged demands and confirmed cases
of COVID-19 in the county (ordered by correlation with school
demand). Our results show a strong correlation between campus
closures, social distancing quantified by CDN demand, and reduc-
tion of COVID-19 incidence. Despite the rapidly increasing trend of
new COVID-19 cases in the US, as a whole, during the November-
December 2020 period [50], COVID-19 incidence in most college
towns we analyzed show similar trends as that of UIUC.
There are three college campuses showing low correlation co-
efficients (<0.5) between school network demand and confirmed
COVID-19 cases: University of Mississippi, Blinn College, and Mis-
sissippi State University. We notice that the counties where these
universities are located show a sharp increase in confirmed cases
before and during the closing of their respective campuses.
Limitations. This part of our study has some specific limitations.
By comparing counties to themselves before and after the end of
term, we removed many potential confounding factors that could
skew the observed trends (e.g., timing of community mitigation mea-
sures, testing capabilities, infrastructure and strictness of testing
guidelines). Still, there may be additional factors we have not taken
into account. As discussed in the related analysis by Auger et al. [3],
it is impossible to totally isolate the effects of this or any single
non-pharmaceutical intervention as school closures were enacted
in close proximity to other measures (e.g., closing of nonessential
businesses and prohibiting large gatherings) and the dynamics of

the pandemic vary across counties and even within counties in
the US. We use COVID-19 incidence rate which is a function of
the population size of the county, but do not adjust to account for
people who may have left once the term ends or the campus closes.
We are unable to determine the fraction of the population who has
actually left the county, and the number of people with/without
the virus infection among those who left the area is unclear.
7 MASK MANDATES AND DEMAND
In previous sections, we explored the relationship between CDN de-
mand, social distancing and the rate of COVID-19 infection. Social
distance measures, such as stay-at-home, school and non-essential
businesses closures, are some of the available NPIs. Numerous stud-
ies have suggested face masks or coverings as another NPI effective
at curbing the transmission of the virus (e.g., [1, 48, 67]), by pre-
venting the spreading of respiratory droplets from when a person
talks, sneezes or coughs, and the inhalation of these droplets by the
wearer. Despite some of these studies showing a potential reduc-
tion in the infection rates across the US [48, 67] and Germany [52],
several US states have lifted their mask mandates, notwithstanding
the low vaccination rates among their population.
In the following paragraph we leverage CDN demand as a proxy
of social distancing to extend an often-cited study by Van Dyke
et al. on the positive impact of mask-wearing [67]. In a Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report by the US Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) and the CDC [67], the authors investigate
trends in COVID-19 incidence in Kansas before and after a gover-
nor’s executive order requiring masks or other face coverings in
public spaces came into effect. Among the main limitations of their
study, the authors point to the absence of social distancing infor-
mation, a clear confounding factor. We build on their work using
CDN demand to address this limitation, and explore the combined
effects of social distancing and mask mandates.
The governor of Kansas issued an executive order, effective as
of July 3, 2020, requiring the wearing of masks in public spaces. A
Kansas state law enacted just a month before (June 9, 2020) allows
counties to issue less strict public health policies as compared to the
ones issued by the state. Therefore, several counties chose to opt
out or partially opt out of this mandate. Van Dyke et al. [67] uses
the variations in mask mandate adoptions in the state of Kansas as
the basis of a natural experiment [18] to evaluate the effectiveness
of this NPI.
