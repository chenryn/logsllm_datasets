**Scenarios:**
Suppose there is an assistive technology where you can seek help from your friends by taking a photo of the object, recording the question, and sending it to them. You can also make video calls to your friends to seek help. Now we would like to ask you about your comfort levels when using such platforms in various situations. In particular, we would like to understand how you would like to use such technologies to get help from your friends.

**Q13.** Suppose you went to a restaurant and were served a can of soda. You want to know the type of the soda but there is no one around to ask. If there was an assistive technology where you could ask your friends to identify the soda can by taking a picture of it, how comfortable would you feel asking them for help? We used a 5-point Likert scale (1: extremely uncomfortable, 5: extremely comfortable).

**Q14.** Suppose while taking the picture there were some other objects captured along with the soda can. How comfortable would you feel if the following were present in the photo and visible to your friends along with the soda can? We used the same 5-point Likert scale described in Q13 for each of the following options:
- Credit card
- Your face or body part
- Restaurant bill
- The book you are reading
- Other people sitting at the next table
- Other foods you ordered
- Medical prescriptions

You don’t want to ask any of your coworkers to identify the bottles for you. If there was an assistive technology where you could ask your friends to identify the medicine bottles by taking a picture of the medicines, how comfortable would you feel asking them for help? We used a 5-point Likert scale (1: extremely uncomfortable, 5: extremely comfortable).

**Q17.** Suppose, while taking the picture of the medicine bottles, there were some other objects captured along with the medicines. How comfortable would you feel if the following were present in the photo and visible to your friends along with the medicine bottles? We used the same 5-point Likert scale described in Q16 for each of the following options:
- Medical prescription
