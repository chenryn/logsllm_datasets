Scenarios: Suppose there is an assistive technology where you can seek
help from your friends by taking a photo of the object, recording the question
and sending it to them. You can also make video calls to your friends to
seek help. Now we would like to ask you about your comfort levels when
using such platforms in various situations. In particular, we would like to
understand how you would like to use such technologies to get help from
your friends.
Q13. Suppose you went to a restaurant and were served a can of soda.
You want to know the type of the soda but there is no one around to ask.
If there was an assistive technology where you could ask your friends to
identify the soda can by taking a picture of it, how comfortable would you
feel asking them for help? We used a 5-point Likert scale (1: extremely
uncomfortable, 5: extremely comfortable)
Q14. Suppose while taking the picture there were some other objects
captured along with the soda can. How comfortable would you feel if the
following were present in the photo and visible to your friends along with
the soda can? We used same 5-point Likert scale described in Q13 for each
of the following options.
Credit card; Your face or body part; Restaurant bill; The book
you are reading; Other people sitting in the next table; Other
foods you ordered; Medical prescriptions; Messy area; Laptop
screen; Your reﬂection on a laptop screen.

Q16. Suppose you are at your workplace and need to take your prescrip-
tion medicine. But there are two similarly sized bottles of medicine, and
you need to differentiate between them. You don’t want to ask any of your
coworkers to identify the bottles for you. If there was an assistive technology
where you could ask your friends to identify the medicine bottles by taking
a picture of the medicines, how comfortable would you feel asking them
for help? We used a 5-point Likert scale (1: extremely uncomfortable, 5:
extremely comfortable)
Q17. Suppose, while taking the picture of medicine bottles there were
some other objects captured along with the medicines. How comfortable
would you feel if the following were present in the photo and visible to your
friends along with the medicine bottles? We used same 5-point Likert scale
described in Q16 for each of the following options.
Medical prescription; Your face or body part; Credit card; Mail
containing your and your friend’s addresses; Messy area; Photo
frame with your family picture; Laptop screen; Ofﬁcial docu-
ments, Your co-worker’s face or body part; Food items.
Q18. Can you please brieﬂy explain your selection above? (Open text)
Q19. Suppose you are preparing to attend a party and thinking of wearing
the new dress/suit you just bought. Now you want to wear a scarf/tie with it

If there is an assistive technology where you can ask for the opinion of your
friends by taking a picture of you wearing the dress/suit and the scarf/tie,
how comfortable would you feel asking them for help? We used a 5-point
Likert scale (1: extremely uncomfortable, 5: extremely comfortable)
