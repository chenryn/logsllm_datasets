basic necessity for efficient and organized development, and SWAP is an ideal step towards that direction. The
SWAP layers can be extended and merged to fulfill most multi-tiered business applications using ontologies
and web service integration. Detailed analysis of merging layers in SWAP for different business needs is part
of the ongoing and future research. We intend to develop other testbed applications using SWAP, and run
empirical studies to determine its effectiveness.

Technical background
1. Knowledge and Content Technologies in the EU's sixth Framework Programme
Knowledge and content technologies are intertwined research themes covered under the Semantic-based
Knowledge and Content Systems Strategic Objective (SO) of the Information Society Technologies (IST) Priority, a
major component of the sixth Framework Programme (FP6).
Council Decision adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration:
“Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area):
(iv) Knowledge and interface technologies
The objective is to improve usability of IST applications and services and access to the knowledge they embody in order to
encourage their wider adoption and faster deployment. Integration issues related to multimedia research technologies will
also be addressed.
– Knowledge technologies and digital content: The objective is to provide automated solutions for creating and organising
virtual knowledge spaces (e.g. collective memories, digital libraries) so as to stimulate radically new content and media
services and applications. Work will focus on technologies to support the process of acquiring and modelling, navigating
and retrieving, representing and visualising, interpreting and sharing knowledge. These functions will be integrated in
new semantic-based and context-aware systems including cognitive and agent-based tools. Work will address extensible
knowledge resources and ontologies so as to facilitate service interoperability and enable next-generation semantic web
applications. Research will also address technologies to support the design, creation, management and publishing of
multimedia content, across fixed and mobile networks and devices, with the ability to self-adapt to user expectations.
2. Current status within IST
Broadly speaking, the IST Work programme for 2005-6 aims to continue the main research lines of WP 2003-
4, albeit with some focusing of activities, yet driving the ongoing convergence of knowledge, semantic and
digital media technologies. This SO will call for project proposals under the 4th IST call. Successful submissions
are likely to lead to contracts effective from January 2006.
The first two IST calls for Knowledge and Content RTD yielded 33 projects totalling around €137M (EU
funding). The first projects began work in January 2004. Many will continue until the end of 2007, while others
will deliver results towards the end of 2005. Most of the projects from the second call were underway by
October 2004, with a typical duration of 3-4 years. Refer to http://www.cordis.lu/ist/
directorate_e/kmcc/index.htm for more details regarding the projects and the research topics they address.
It is expected that the calls launched in 2005-6 will lead to fewer, more ambitious endeavours. The SO
budget envelope for the 4th call is in the region of €110-120M.
New proposals should avoid repeating the tasks of ongoing projects and aim to progress beyond, or at least
complement, topics covered in projects resulting from the first two calls of FP6.
Considering the comprehensive portfolio of projects likely to result from FP6 calls, significant progress in the
field is expected by the end of the decade.
3. Work Programme 2005-6 - Consultation process and update
In the IST Work programme for 2003-4, knowledge and content related research themes were presented under
the SOs ‘Semantic based Knowledge Systems’ and ‘Cross-media Content for Leisure and Entertainment’. To prepare
for the second phase of the implementation of the IST priority, it was decided to re-assess the work
programme, based on progress to date in terms of response to calls for proposals, an assessment of possible
changes to market conditions and requirements, as well as the progress of ongoing scientific research. The
work programme was assessed with the help of external experts in a broad consultation process addressing all
IST SOs.
54
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
The recommendation of the consultation was that the Knowledge SO be fine-tuned, with emphasis on (i)
knowledge acquisition and modelling and (ii) knowledge sharing and use. Particular emphasis was placed
on
a. achieving a higher level of analytical and interpretative capability across all content types (text, still and
moving images, audio, n-dimensional objects…), and
b. semantic-based systems facilitating inter-organisation knowledge sharing and collaboration.
Thus, the proposed directions for the second phase of FP6 would ensure a high degree of continuity with
regard to ongoing actions arising from the earlier calls, while stimulating ambitious proposals to address
even more advanced S&T challenges.
With regard to Content RTD, a longer-term paradigm addressing intelligent, self-descriptive, user/context
aware and adaptive content objects was identified as being very promising. This will drive the move towards
radically new, all-digital forms of content (video, audio, n-dimensional, etc.), for all media and contexts of
use.
As content and knowledge are clearly inextricably linked, it was subsequently decided to merge the
Knowledge and Content SOs into a single SO, ‘Semantic-based Knowledge and Content Systems’. The 2005-6
Work programme text for the combined SO is closely based on the outcome of the above-mentioned
consultation.
4. European perspective
Semantic-based systems cut across many socio-economic domains and are fundamental to knowledge
intensive sectors, which include some of Europe’s key industries – manufacturing, including automotive and
aerospace, engineering, chemical and process industries, pharmaceuticals, financial sectors, media and
telecoms as well as other important areas such as scientific Research, eGovernment, eHealth etc. There is
clearly a window of opportunity to exploit knowledge technologies in these sectors where Europe already has
a leading position, in order to gain a real competitive advantage and improve the quality of life for Europe
today and in the future.
EU funded research aims to leverage Europe’s skills and vast wealth of knowledge resources and to encourage
European industries to play a full and competitive part in developing knowledge-based services. The added-
value in European research is typically in stimulating technologies and systems which are suited to the multi-
cultural and multi-lingual European markets, and to the high expectations of European users.
In Europe there is a further need to promote a critical mass of interdisciplinary research, to avoid the risk of
over-fragmentation. Collaborative efforts will help to create new alliances in Europe in key emerging areas
like advanced Web services and semantic-based infrastructures. In this respect, the participation of industrial
stakeholders – technology providers, ICT suppliers and integrators, content providers and especially leading
edge users is vital.
5. Research aims and focus for 2005-6
The Semantic-based Knowledge and Content Systems SO is aimed at the intersection of WWW, Multimedia,
Semantic Web and Web Services domains. Semantic-based methods are seen as a means for providing
complex and yet flexible, interoperable services and applications.
The overall objective is to develop semantic-based and context-aware systems to acquire, organise, share
and use the knowledge embedded in web and multimedia content, information holdings of all media
types, or processes which are driven or supported by ICT systems.
Research will aim to maximise automation of the knowledge lifecycle and to achieve semantic
interoperability between heterogeneous information resources and services, across content types (such as
text, still and moving images, music) and natural languages. The intention is to dramatically improve access
to, sharing and use of information by humans as well as by and between machines.
Moreover, a visionary, strategically important opportunity exists to pioneer intelligent content, which will be
self-describing, adaptive to context, and exhibit a seamless interaction with its physical and digital
surroundings, and the user. Challenges relating to the ongoing convergence of content and knowledge with
metadata based systems and processes for all-digital content creation and management will also be addressed.

5.1 Approach
This SO is mostly centred around medium- to long-term research with relatively short-term by-products.
Emphasis is on
a) enabling technologies and middleware, and
b) application platforms and architectures which are portable across domains.
Foundational research is also recognised as being extremely important and is expected to target, for example,
formal theories, models and languages for networked knowledge representation and reasoning, modelling of
context, and the intelligent content paradigm.
The strategy, therefore, is to undertake the necessary foundational and component-level research on the one
hand, and to test and prove technology and components in representative demonstrators and broadly based
test-beds, addressing functionality and usability, robustness and complexity, scalability and ease of
customisation on the other. Emphasis should be placed on the user (enterprise, institutional), particularly
with regard to hiding complexity and developing intuitive information interfaces. These large-scale, though
relatively short-term (3-4 year) efforts must demonstrate the effective deployment of semantic technologies in
support of demanding users, using realistic, large-volume data sets from information bound sectors including
(e-)business, manufacturing, digital media, e-science as well as other economically important fields with high
growth potential.
Test-beds will play a critical role in proving the technical feasibility and socio-economic / organisational
impact of knowledge systems in the provision of adaptable and context-aware services in support of planning
and problem solving, automated diagnosis and decision-making. The tools and methods developed should
likewise help to promote semantic interoperability and exchange between systems and services and shift focus
towards dynamic knowledge and active content. They are expected to provide a solid basis for further
integration and customisation to functional systems in support of e-commerce (B2B), information / content
management, enterprise application integration, decision support in business and scientific discovery.
5.2 Research themes
The research focus is on three main themes:
a) Knowledge acquisition and modelling,
b) Knowledge sharing and use,
c) Exploring and bringing to maturity the intelligent content vision.
5.2.1 Knowledge acquisition and modelling
Knowledge acquisition and modelling, capturing knowledge from raw information and multimedia content in webs and
other distributed repositories to turn poorly structured information into machine-processable knowledge. Instruments:
IPs, NoEs, STREPs
The first research theme of this SO deals with new ways to model and formally represent knowledge about
real-life objects and processes. This theme encompasses basic research, knowledge infrastructure (especially
ontologies) and automated information / content analysis techniques. It addresses the capture of knowledge
from raw information and multimedia content in webs and other distributed repositories, adding semantics to
turn information into machine-processable knowledge.
Emphasis is placed on progressing towards a comparable level of analytical and interpretative capability
within and across content types (still and moving images, music and broadcast news, n-dimensional objects
e.g. 3D) as currently exists for text. In an expanding European Union with additional languages and cultural
preferences, cross-lingual approaches are highly important.
The emphasis of this research theme is not just on semantic web(s). In this context, however, it should be noted
that the favoured approach is to target sectoral semantic webs – i.e. collective knowledge spaces within a
given domain or community – as opposed to a grand, universal Semantic Web. Likewise, the emphasis is on
useable solutions, even if these may be ‘imperfect’.
56
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
Foundational research will typically address formal models and languages for representing static and dynamic
knowledge, including the semi-automatic creation of ontologies and their maintainability, extensibility and
evolution, emphasising data-driven approaches, as well as interoperable ontologies.
Component level research will address methods and tools aimed at higher levels of information harvesting,
including automated knowledge discovery, metadata extraction, annotation and summarisation, concept
based and contextual retrieval of all types of digital content, paying due attention to cross-media and cross-
lingual aspects. Pushing the boundaries beyond text-based analysis will pave the way for e.g. seamless cross-
media search. Where appropriate, work should build on and re-use existing technology, improving and
recoding where necessary, with a view to integrating project results within larger systems and applications.
Considering the emphasis placed on integration within larger / complete systems, priority will be given to
open architectures or alternative approaches ensuring seamless interworking between components or across
sub-systems. In the interests of maximising the impact of the research programme as well as driving the
adoption of the technology, consortia must commit to making project results (architectures, tools and
interfaces) widely available – including as open source, via appropriate licensing agreements – as part of a
well-defined dissemination and exploitation plan.
5.2.2 Knowledge sharing and use
Knowledge sharing and use, combining semantically enriched information with context to provide actionable meaning,
applying inferencing and reasoning for decision support and collaborative use of trusted knowledge between
organisations. Instruments: IPs, NoEs, STREPs, SSAs
The second research line covers knowledge sharing and use within collaborative systems and workflows,
combining semantically enriched information with context to provide actionable meaning and related
problem solving/decision support functionalities. Such systems will apply inferencing, reasoning and
machine learning techniques for decision support and the collaborative use of trusted knowledge between
organisations. Research will aim to allow improved (smarter, faster, more accurate) access to information of all
sorts for and by humans as well as for and by machines.
Adding semantics to data will allow improved integration of data interoperation between information systems
– including ‘legacy’ data – within distributed communities and between organisations. An additional
challenge is to develop models for representing and handling evolving (i.e. non-repetitive) processes,
workflows and contexts, moving from static to dynamic knowledge and to actionable meaning.
Current Web Services require interaction between humans and computers. Semantic-based methods and
techniques, e.g. adding semantics to assist with service description and discovery, are seen as a means for
delivering complex yet flexible, automated services. Likewise, semantic-based methods are also seen as a
scaleable and cost effective solution to the problem of enterprise application integration.
Possible application areas include improved access to and use of corporate content, digital libraries and audio-
visual repositories, business intelligence and product data, scientific experimentation and discovery.
Foundational research will address the semantics of evolving, dynamic processes and computational models for
context of use with the aim of progressing from mere data interoperability to flexible service-level
interworking. Research will help advance the state of the art in the fields of reasoning, inferencing and
machine learning over large volumes of distributed, incomplete and often conflicting data. Research will
address how to extract and exploit knowledge in processes, as well as modelling the process itself. Processes
might include routine operations between different systems within an organisation as well as more complex,
bespoke operations involving specification, negotiation, contracting, invoicing etc. within and between
organisations.
Component- and system-level research will help to bring existing and emerging technologies to maturity,
integrating them to create semantic-based collaborative services, and leading to scaleable platforms to
manage, search, share, personalise, present and exploit complex knowledge spaces that cross the boundaries
between organisations or communities. Work will include new strategies and innovative combinations of
components which challenge, complement or improve established approaches.
While this research theme makes room for foundational research, it is primarily geared towards integrative
scenarios (test-beds) intended to address issues such as performance, reliability, scalability and user
acceptance, as well as data- and service- level interworking between organisations and communities. The
57
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
overall aim is to stimulate cross-disciplinary partnerships leading to large scale experimentation
demonstrating technical and organisational feasibility as well as cost effectiveness and replicability.
Clearly, this emphasis on integrative scenarios means that several or all research themes of the SO can be
covered by the most ambitious projects. The desired result is robust, scaleable solutions which are portable
across key application domains in industry, trade, science and society at large.
