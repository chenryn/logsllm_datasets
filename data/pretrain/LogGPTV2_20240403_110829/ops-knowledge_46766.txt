Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the template extraction:

**Original Log Line:**
```
NIFF: node node-182 has detected an available network connection on network 10.128.0.0 via interface ee0
```

**Extracted Template:**
```
NIFF: node node-<NODE_ID> has detected an available network connection on network <NETWORK_ADDRESS> via interface ee0
```

In this template:
- `<NODE_ID>` represents the unique identifier of the node (e.g., `node-182`).
- `<NETWORK_ADDRESS>` represents the IP address or network range (e.g., `10.128.0.0`).
