User: I'm using Python to run a .ksh script, using subprocess.call().
This script requires the user to enter text at certain points - whatever the equivalent of Python's input() is in KSH I guess.
The problem I'm having is that I have to run the script ~200 times, and I don't want to have to enter this information each time. Is there anyway that I can set it up so that these requests for user input are automatically given some value each time without the user even needing to do anything?
I'm pretty new to using Python at the shell in this way, so apologies if this question doesn't make sense. Happy to take any feedback. I haven't found this question asked previously - mostly people ask about passing arguments to the script - but I may have missed something as I was having trouble finding the key search terms.
The Python version is 2.7, and it's a UNIX environment.
Assistant: You can save your parameters in Python and give them on the commandline each time you call the script.  
Your script can store them in a file (or database, service, ..) and read them when started again.
