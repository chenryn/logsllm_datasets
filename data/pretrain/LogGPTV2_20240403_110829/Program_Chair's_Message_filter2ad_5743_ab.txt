### Differences Among Reviewers and Online Discussion Phase

The goal was to minimize differences among reviewers, leaving only a few substantive issues for focused discussion during the Program Committee (PC) meeting. Tagging papers as "yellow" was not a way to avoid work; instead, it was a strategic decision that assumed liberal use of shepherding, but not for adding new results. I monitored discussions for all papers, nudged reviewers, clarified policies, reminded them of the conference's philosophies, and obtained additional reviews as needed. I paid extra attention to papers turning "red" and those leaning towards "yellow."

Although this phase required significant effort, it played a critical role in ensuring a smooth PC meeting with well-informed decisions. No system is perfect, but I identify the following advantages of having an online discussion phase with mandatory participation from all reviewers:

1. **Representation of Non-PC Reviewers' Opinions**: It ensured that non-PC reviewers' opinions were adequately represented during the PC meeting. In a broad conference like ASPLOS, non-PC reviewers often provide key expertise. We accepted some papers where the only champions were External Review Committee (ERC) reviewers because they forcefully argued for the paper during the online discussion phase.

2. **Reflection on Each Other's Opinions**: It allowed reviewers to reflect on each other's opinions in ways not possible when the first discussion occurs at the PC meeting. For example, by reading previous work or confirming an opinion from another expert. These reflections resolved many differences among reviewers that could have become unhelpful sticking points in the limited time of a PC meeting.

3. **Clarification of Policies and Philosophies**: It allowed me to provide clarifications on matters of policy and philosophy that sometimes needlessly take up too much PC meeting time (e.g., whether a prior workshop submission constitutes prior art or if the paper meets the multidisciplinary criteria of ASPLOS).

4. **Mandatory Participation and Judicious Nagging**: Mandatory participation (and judicious nagging) reduced (hopefully eliminated) the number of PC members arriving at the meeting without reading author responses and other reviews.

5. **More Effective PC Meeting**: It resulted in a more effective PC meeting with greater engagement from all members. I reminded the PC that most of the meeting was focused on papers where ≥ 5 reviewers had failed to reach consensus after significant deliberation, elevating the importance of their input with clear issues to debate.

This phase identified 23 green and 65 yellow papers for the PC meeting.

### PC Meeting

The PC meeting took place at the O’Hare Hilton on October 30th (a weekday) from 8:00 AM to 6:15 PM. One PC member could not attend due to an injury. I made all papers and reviews available to all PC members (excluding conflicts), assigned a PC lead to each green and yellow paper, and sent all meeting procedures two days before the meeting. A PC member was allowed to turn any paper to yellow for discussion.

The guiding philosophy for the PC discussion was to seek consensus rather than make decisions through narrow majority votes and to give the reviewers (who had read the papers) priority in making the final decision.

For the discussion order, within each color, I mostly used the average overall merit score, but I interleaved sessions of green and yellow papers in the morning. We covered about 50 papers before lunch, with the green papers taking little time. For the yellow papers, if about 5 minutes of discussion did not reveal a path to consensus among the reviewers, we took a full PC (without the reviewers) vote. This vote was advisory input for the reviewers and was recorded in HotCRP. In many cases, the PC vote changed some reviewers' minds and resulted in an immediate consensus decision among the reviewers. In 9 cases, the differences remained, and the paper was tabled.

For tabled papers, the reviewers and any interested PC members got together during the ample breaks (with food!) to attempt a consensus. I nudged these small-group discussions along as needed; many were long and intense. A late afternoon session revisited these papers with the full PC. If the reviewers had reached the same agreement as the majority in the previously recorded PC vote, then this result was simply recorded as the final decision. If the new reviewer consensus was different from the PC vote, then the reviewers provided their rationale, entertained questions from the PC, and the new consensus vote was recorded as the final decision. If the reviewers could not reach a consensus even after all the deliberation, then we used the majority vote among them as the final decision. A tie among reviewers used the earlier full PC majority vote for the decision.

During the meeting, a PC member conflicted with a paper left the room for that paper (Sandhya led the discussion for my conflicts). Papers of PC members were handled similarly to the others.

We accepted 49 papers, 12 of which were shepherded. The acceptance rate of 23% was coincidentally the same as last year. 10 accepted papers were co-authored by a PC member out of 24 PC submissions. For most papers and all rejected papers that had an author response, the lead for the paper included a brief summary of the online and PC meeting discussions with the review.

### Reflections

In the last several years, our reviewing processes have come a long way, but there appears to still be room for improvement. My review checks and the distributed review sufficiency checks (RSCs) resulted in many reviews being updated. The mandatory online discussions, adopted by some but not all recent conferences, clarified many misunderstandings and changed opinions. I believe the high quality of these pre-PC meeting deliberations and the consensus-driven approach led to more informed (and efficient) decisions during the PC meeting. For the papers where consensus was hardest, the face-to-face, small group deliberations during the PC meeting provided an opportunity for more reflection before a final decision.

I would like to credit all past PC chairs from whom I liberally borrowed many ideas. Specifically, Ras Bodik (ASPLOS’13) first exposed me to a review process that employed intensive online discussion and was consensus-driven. The ASPLOS’14 process was mostly based on his framework. I also benefited from discussions with Vikram Adve (ASPLOS’10), Christos Kozyrakis (MICRO’13), Margaret Martonosi (ISCA’13), and Onur Mutlu (MICRO’12).

### The Program

The 49 accepted technical papers are organized into two tracks. Monday morning will feature two lightning sessions with overviews of all papers to help attendees choose the sessions to attend. For closer interaction with authors, Tuesday afternoon features a poster session with all papers.

Several plenary sessions complement the technical papers. Monday morning kicks off with a keynote by Brad Calder (Microsoft) describing his experiences with a modern commercial cloud operating system, a topic that directly resonates with many ASPLOS submissions. Tuesday morning starts with a keynote by Jeff Gehlhaar (Qualcomm) describing a brain-inspired processor that overcomes the obstacles of post-Dennard scaling but creates new challenges that could inspire many future ASPLOS submissions. Tuesday ends with the ASPLOS tradition of a “Wild and Crazy Ideas (WACI)” session. The WACI team, ably led by Luis Ceze and Karin Strauss, has done a remarkable job attracting frontier ideas that are sure to inspire, with a cornerstone invited WACInote by Josh Smith (U Washington) on RF-powered computing and communication. Wednesday will start with a debate on whether specialized systems will supplant general-purpose alternatives, moderated by David Wood, again a hot topic touching many ASPLOS submissions.

This year, ASPLOS will have a business meeting and an awards lunch for the first time. Also new is that the technical papers will be openly available in the ACM digital library about a week before the conference. Despite the packed program, we have included many breaks and a one-of-a-kind excursion—we hope these enable serendipitous interactions leading to technical inspirations and collaborations that make some of the most memorable conference experiences.

### Acknowledgements

The program is the result of the hard work of many people, several of whom went above and beyond the call of duty. The general co-chairs, Rajeev Balasubramonian and Al Davis, were an absolute pleasure to work with. I started to imagine them with a magic wand in their hands—no matter what I asked of them, they said yes, even though it meant more fundraising and attention to countless details.

I benefited throughout from the wisdom and quick response times of the steering committee and earlier mentioned my gratitude to past PC chairs. The submission chairs, my students Rakesh Komuravelli and Hyojin Sung, tirelessly and cheerfully took care of the submission website. They also attended the PC meeting, recording decisions, moving conflicts in and out, and handling numerous logistics required for a smooth meeting. The review process I described would not be possible without HotCRP and the generosity of its author, Eddie Kohler. Sandhya Dwarkadas handled my conflicts, diligently following all the details of this year’s review process. I was originally undecided on whether to have a WACI session, but the infectious enthusiasm of Luis Ceze and Karin Strauss and their volunteering to lead the charge enabled me to make the right decision. David Wood agreed to organize the debate even though I interrupted his vacation. Manju Shevgoor diligently kept the conference website up to date, and Niti Madan contacted many places new to ASPLOS as publicity chair. Michelle Osborne, my assistant, helped with logistics for the PC meeting.

Finally, none of this would be possible without the tireless efforts of the PC, ERC, and other reviewers and the work of the authors. Many of these were truly inspiring.
