effectively creates a new path from the transmitter to the TV re-
ceiver. Since TV receivers are designed to compute the multi-
path channel parameters, they can estimate the effects of this
new path and decode the TV transmissions without interference.
However, for small distances (less than 2.3 inches), the near-
ﬁeld effects dominate and hence the linearity model, typically
assumed while estimating the multi-path channel, does not hold;
resulting in video glitches.
• The distance at which the video glitches are noticeable is larger
for higher transmission rates: the median distances is about
4.1 inches and 3.7 inches for 1 kbps and 10 kbps respectively.
At high transmission rates, the transmitter changes the multipath
channel at a higher rate; hence, making it difﬁcult for the TV
receiver to estimate the fast-changing multipath channel.
• Across bit rates, the TV receiver does not see any noticeable
glitches for distances greater than 7.2 inches.
7. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT APPLICATIONS
Ambient backscatter enables devices to communicate using only
ambient RF as the source of power. We believe that this opens
up a new form of ubiquitous communication where devices can
communicate by backscattering ambient RF signals without any
additional power infrastructure. In this section, we demonstrate
proof-of-concepts for two applications that are enabled by ambi-
ent backscatter: a bus card that can transfer money to other cards
anywhere and a grocery store application where item tags can tell
when an item is placed in a wrong shelf. These proof-of-concepts
are similar to existing RFID applications, but differ in ways that
were previously impossible—they are able to function anywhere
and with no maintenance. They are only a glimpse into the possi-
bilities opened by this technique, and we consider fully exploring
the potential uses and addressing issues such as security or usability
to be out of the scope of this paper.
7.1 Smart Card Application
We use our prototype design to evaluate a smart card application
where passive cards can communicate with each other anywhere,
any time, without the need for a powered reader. Such an appli-
cation can be used in multiple scenarios, such as money transfer
between credit cards, paying bills in a restaurant by swiping the
credit card on the bill or to implement a digital paper technology
which can display digital information using e-ink [39] and transfer
content to other digital paper using ambient backscatter.
In this section, we implement and evaluate a simple proof-of-
concept of the smart card application. We leverage our proto-
type that comes complete with an ambient backscattering transmit-
ter/receiver, MSP430 microcontroller, capacitive touch sensor, and
LEDs. When a user swipes the touch sensors (marked by A, B,
C in Fig. 2), in the presence of another card, it transmits the phrase
"Hello World". The receiver on the other card decodes the transmis-
sion, checks the CRC, and conﬁrms a successful packet decoding
by ﬂashing the LED. We perform this experiment at three different
locations including the two locations farthest from the TV tower.
Experiments: We place the cards 4 inches from each other and have
the user perform the swipe. The transmitter and receiver communi-
cate at a bit rate of 1 kbps. The microcontroller is programmed to

detect changes at the touch sensors and trigger transmissions. The
transmitter backscatters a packet with a 96 bit "Hello World" pay-
load and a 4-bit CRC. The receiver decodes the packet and if the
CRC check passes, blinks the LED (for 1 ms) to provide a visual
conﬁrmation to the user. The devices are powered completely by
harvested TV energy. The user performs the swipe 100 times at an
interval of three seconds between the swipes. Since blinking the
LED drains the capacitor in the harvester, the three second time in-
terval allows the harvester to duty-cycle and accumulate charge on
the capacitor to perform the LED blinking operations again.
Results: Fig. 12 plots, for locations 5 and 6, the number of retries
required by the user to successfully perform the whole operation:
the user swiping the touch sensors, the card transmitting the packet,
and ﬁnally, the LED blinking on the other card. The plot shows that
in 94% of cases, the user only had to perform one swipe to see the
LED blink on the other card, and even in the worst case, the user
did not require more than two retries to successfully complete the
operation. Furthermore, automation of communication startup (i.e.,
removing the user and touch sensor from the process) decreased the
failure rate to nearly zero, indicating that it was not the communi-
cation mechanism that was failing, but rather user input error.
7.2 Grocery Store Application
Ambient backscatter can also be used to tell when an item is
missing or out of place on a shelf in a grocery store. In this section,
we use our prototype to evaluate a proof-of-concept for this ap-
plication. The algorithm we use is simple: each device broadcasts
its ID periodically (every 5 sec). Neighboring tags listen to these
transmissions and store the successfully decoded IDs. Each tag de-
termines on its own if it is out-of-place by computing the difference
between its ID and that of the overheard IDs. If the tag has at least
two different stored IDs that have this distance to be greater than a
threshold, it concludes that it is out-of-place and ﬂashes the LED.
Experiments: We attach ten of our prototype tags to ten cereal
boxes, and place those boxes next to one another on a shelf. We
set the IDs for nine of these tags to be between 201 and 209 and
place them in-order. We then set the ID for the tenth tag to be 100
and place it in the 8 locations between the in-order tags, for a total
of 40 experiments. A nearby antenna broadcasts an RFID signal,
and we measure the time it takes for the out-of-place tag to ﬂash
the LED.
Results: We plot the results in Fig. 13. The plot shows that in about
50% of the experiments, the out-of-place tag requires less than 20
seconds to ﬂash the LED. Further, in the worst case, the out-of-
place tag starts blinking within 190 seconds. We note, however, that

8. RELATED WORK
Prior work mainly falls in the following two domains:
(a) Wireless Communication: Today, wireless communication
is limited to two main approaches: radio communication and
backscatter communication. Conventional radio communication re-
quires devices to generate radio signals. This approach is problem-
atic from a power perspective since it requires power-hungry analog
components such as digital-to-analog converters (DACs), mixers,
oscillators and power ampliﬁers at the transmitter [30, 16] and low
noise ampliﬁers, mixers, oscillators and ADCs at the receiver [30,
16]. While prior research has focused on reducing the power con-
sumption of these analog components [23, 10, 6, 28, 13], backscat-
ter communication is two orders of magnitude more power-efﬁcient
than state-of-the-art radio communication [25, 35, 11]; and hence
is more appropriate for battery-free devices [31, 38].
Traditional backscatter communication (e.g., RFID), however,
requires a powered device called the reader to generate a high-
power constant signal which battery-free devices backscatter back
to the reader. These battery-free devices are rendered unusable in
the absence of the powered reader and hence require an infrastruc-
ture of powered readers that can be expensive and infeasible.
This paper introduces ambient backscatter, a new approach to
communication where devices can communicate without either
generating signals (as in radio communication) or backscattering
from a dedicated reader (as in traditional backscatter). Ambient
backscatter eliminates the need for a power infrastructure and hence
can enable new forms of ubiquitous communication at locations and
scales that were previously infeasible.
The closest to our work is recent work in [20] that demonstrates
direct communication between two RFID tags placed 25 mm away
from each other. However, it works only in the presence of a dedi-
cated RFID reader that generates a constant high-power signal. Our
work is orthogonal to [20] in that we enable devices to communi-
cate using ambient RF signals. We note, however, that in principle
the techniques in this paper can also be used to enable RFID tag-to-
tag communication at much larger distances than 25 mm.
(b) Power Harvesting: In this domain, our work is most directly re-
lated to wireless power and ambient RF power harvesting. Wireless
power aims to wirelessly charge and power devices by transmitting
energy from a dedicated power source [32]. Ambient backscatter is
complementary to this work. Speciﬁcally, it focuses on enabling
communication using ambient RF as the only source of power,
without requiring any additional power sources.
Recent work on ambient RF power harvesting demonstrated that
one can harvest useful amounts of power from ambient TV [32] and
cellular signals [24]. Our work is motivated by this work and takes
49it one step further. Speciﬁcally, we introduce a new communication
system that enables devices to communicate with each other using
ambient RF. We achieve this by introducing ambient backscatter
where devices communicate by backscattering ambient RF signals.
9. CONCLUSION
For the ﬁrst few decades of their existence, computers were fun-
damentally limited by the infrastructure on which they rely. Com-
puters were tethered by their power cords and were rendered useless
without a nearby power outlet. Wireless communication combined
with battery packs liberated these devices for short periods of time
so that they could compute and communicate, untethered, as long
as their batteries were occasionally recharged or replaced.
In this paper, we introduce ambient backscatter, a new form of
communication that provides connectivity between computers out
of what is essentially thin air. In this technique, TV signals and
other source of RF signals serve as both the source of power and the
means of communication. Because ambient backscatter avoids the
maintenance-heavy batteries and dedicated power infrastructure of
other forms of low-power communication (e.g., RFID and NFC), it
enables a bevy of new applications that were previously impossible
or at least impractical. We believe that ambient backscatter provides
a key building block that enables ubiquitous communication (with
no restrictions except the existence of ambient RF signals) among
pervasive devices which are cheap and have near-zero maintenance.
