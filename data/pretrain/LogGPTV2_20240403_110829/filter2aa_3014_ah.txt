Apache  An open-source HTTP server that is integrated into Mac OS X Server. You can 
find detailed information about Apache at www.apache.org.
application server  Software that runs and manages other applications, usually web 
applications, that are accessed using a web browser. The managed applications reside 
on the same computer where the application server runs. 
CGI (Common Gateway Interface)  A script or program that adds dynamic functions to 
a website. A CGI sends information back and forth between a website and an 
application that provides a service for the site. For example, if a user fills out a form on 
the site, a CGI could send the message to an application that processes the data and 
sends a response back to the user.
everyone  Any user who can log in to a file server:  a registered user or guest, an 
anonymous FTP user, or a website visitor. 
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)  The set of symbols or codes inserted in a file to 
be displayed on a World Wide Web browser page. The markup tells the web browser 
how to display a webpage’s words and images for the user.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)  The client/server protocol for the World Wide Web. 
The HTTP protocol provides a way for a web browser to access a web server and 
request hypermedia documents created using HTML.
IP (Internet Protocol)  Also known as IPv4. A method used with Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) to send data between computers over a local network or the Internet. IP 
delivers packets of data, while TCP keeps track of data packets.
IP address  A unique numeric address that identifies a computer on the Internet. 
JavaScript  A scripting language used to add interactivity to webpages. 
JBoss  A full-featured Java application server that provides support for Java 2 Platform, 
Enterprise Edition (J2EE) applications.

Glossary    
Mac OS X Server  An industrial-strength server platform that supports Mac, Windows, 
UNIX, and Linux clients out of the box and provides a suite of scalable workgroup and 
network services plus advanced remote management tools. 
MySQL  An open-source relational database management tool for web servers.
open source  A term for the cooperative development of software by the Internet 
community. The basic principle is to involve as many people as possible in writing and 
debugging code by publishing the source code and encouraging the formation of a 
large community of developers who will submit modifications and enhancements. 
owner  The person who created a file or folder and who therefore has the ability to 
assign access privileges for other users. The owner of an item automatically has read/
write privileges for that item. An owner can also transfer ownership of an item to 
another user.
PHP (PHP:  Hypertext Preprocessor)  A scripting language embedded in HTML that is 
used to create dynamic webpages. 
port  A sort of virtual mail slot. A server uses port numbers to determine which 
application should receive data packets. Firewalls use port numbers to determine 
whether or not data packets are allowed to traverse a local network. “Port” usually 
refers to either a TCP or UDP port. 
protocol  A set of rules that determines how data is sent back and forth between two 
applications. 
proxy server  A server that sits between a client application, such as a web browser, 
and a real server. The proxy server intercepts all requests to the real server to see if it 
can fulfill the requests itself. If not, it forwards the request to the real server.
realm  See WebDAV realm.
short name  An abbreviated name for a user. The short name is used by Mac OS X for 
home directories, authentication, and email addresses.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)  An Internet protocol that allows you to send encrypted, 
authenticated information across the Internet.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)  A method used along with the Internet Protocol 
(IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. IP 
takes care of handling the actual delivery of the data, and TCP takes care of keeping 
track of the individual units of data (called packets) into which a message is divided for 
efficient routing through the Internet. 
Tomcat  The official reference implementation for Java Servlet 2.2 and JavaServer Pages 
1.1, two complementary technologies developed under the Java Community Process.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator)  The address of a computer, file, or resource that can 
be accessed on a local network or the Internet. The URL is made up of the name of the 
protocol needed to access the resource, a domain name that identifies a specific 
computer on the Internet, and a hierarchical description of a file location on the 
computer. 
user name  The long name for a user, sometimes referred to as the user’s “real” name. 
See also short name.
WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)  A live authoring 
environment that allows client users to check out webpages, make changes, and then 
check the pages back in while a site is running.
WebDAV realm  A region of a website, usually a folder or directory, that is defined to 
provide access for WebDAV users and groups.
