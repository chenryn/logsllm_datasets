restoring failed IP links.
2.3 Partial Restoration
An immediate question to answer is: “Is there enough room in the
optical domain such that for every fiber cut scenario, we can re-
configure all affected wavelengths to healthy fibers?” The answer
depends on the number of wavelengths that are already provisioned
on fibers. Fig. 5(a) shows the CDF of the spectrum utilization (num-
ber of provisioned wavelengths divided by the total number of
available wavelengths) of Facebook’s fibers. The figure shows that
95% of fibers have a spectrum utilization less than 60%. This means
95% of the fibers have 40% spare room for Arrow’s wavelength
reconfiguration.
𝜙
Note that the usable spectrum for wavelength reconfiguration is
usually smaller than the available spectrum of each fiber link. This is
because, in optical domain, a wavelength’s frequency must remain
the same throughout the entire fiber path. This property is called
wavelength continuity constraint in optical networking literature [12,
20, 64, 88]. For example, as shown in Fig. 5(b), although the three
fiber links (fiber DA, fiber AB, and fiber BC) all have 75% of their
spectrum available (spectrum utilization is 25%), it turns out that
only 25% of the spectrum is usable for reconfiguring 𝜆4. If the failed
IP link between nodes C and D contains more than one wavelength,
it will result in partial restoration, whereby only one wavelength
(𝜆4) can be restored.
To quantify the amount of partial restoration in Facebook, we
𝑊 ′
define the restoration ratio of a fiber 𝜙 as 𝑈𝜙 =
𝑊𝜙 , where 𝑊𝜙 is
the provisioned bandwidth capacity (in Gbps) in healthy state and
𝑊 ′
𝜙 is the restorable bandwidth capacity after 𝜙 is cut. Each fiber in

Facebook carries several wavelengths, 𝜆 ∈ Λ. Hence, 𝑊𝜙 = Σ𝜆𝛽𝜆,
where 𝛽𝜆 is the bandwidth capacity of wavelength 𝜆. 𝑊 ′
𝜙 = Σ𝜆𝛽′
𝜆,
where 𝛽′
𝜆 is the restorable bandwidth capacity of wavelength 𝜆. To
calculate 𝑊 ′
𝜙 we iterate over every wavelength 𝜆 on fiber 𝜙 and
check whether we can reconfigure it using the same frequency and
modulation on any of the fibers adjacent to 𝜙. Most of the time,
the modulation of all wavelengths can be kept the same (details in
Appendix A.1). But the frequency of some wavelengths must be
tuned to avoid frequency collisions with existing wavelengths al-
ready working on surrogate fiber paths using tunable transponders
which are already deployed in Facebook. Even with frequency tun-
ing, in some cases, we may not be able to find a common available
wavelength frequency end-to-end on all of the fibers along the new
fiber path, as different fibers may not have an overlapping available
spectrum due to the wavelength continuity constraint. When there
is no available frequency, the wavelength is not reconfigurable,
and its restorable bandwidth becomes zero, resulting in 𝑊 ′
