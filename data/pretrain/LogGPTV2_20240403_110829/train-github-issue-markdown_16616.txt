## 📝 Provide a description of the new feature
_What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the scenario
this would be used?_
currently there's no shortcut that windows support to navigate between the
open windows of same application. Like I might have opened two firefox
windows. If I Have to go to other window I have to use Alt + Tab and that goes
to the previous used and I need to search and go it. It will be good if
there's a dedicated button like Win+` like mac.
