For instance, when I make a path on a windows system, it usually fails with a
way too long error:
    package main
    import "os"
    func main() {
        err := os.MkdirAll(`C:\Users\AAAA\BBBB\CCCC\DDDD\EEEE\FFFF\GGGG\HHHH\IIII\JJJJ\KKKK\LLLL\MMMM\NNNN\OOOO\PPPP\QQQQ\RRRR\SSSS\TTTT\UUUU\VVVV\WWWW\XXXX\YYYY\ZZZZ\AAAA\BBBB\CCCC\DDDD\EEEE\FFFF\GGGG\HHHH\IIII\JJJJ\KKKK\LLLL\MMMM\NNNN\OOOO\PPPP\QQQQ\RRRR\SSSS\TTTT\UUUU\VVVV\WWWW\XXXX\YYYY\ZZZZ`, os.ModePerm)
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
    }
    ......
    // result
    mkdir C:\Users\AAAA\BBBB\CCCC\DDDD\EEEE\FFFF\GGGG\HHHH\IIII\JJJJ\KKKK\LLLL\MMMM\NNNN\OOOO\PPPP\QQQQ\RRRR\SSSS\TTTT\UUUU\VVVV\WWWW\XXXX\YYYY\
    ZZZZ\AAAA\BBBB\CCCC\DDDD\EEEE\FFFF\GGGG\HHHH\IIII\JJJJ\KKKK\LLLL\MMMM\NNNN\OOOO\PPPP\QQQQ\RRRR\SSSS\TTTT\UUUU\VVVV: The filename or extensio
    n is too long.
To be clear, this is usually fixed by prepending `\\?\` to the path.
