### Issue Report

#### Preliminary Checks
- I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
- I have reviewed the FAQ of this repository and confirmed that this issue has not been previously addressed.

#### Environment
- **Dubbo Version:** 2.7.3 & 2.5.10
- **Operating System:** macOS
- **Java Version:** JDK 1.8

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. When the device's storage is full, the `DubboSaveRegistryCache` thread consumes a significant amount of CPU resources. The following error message is observed:
   ```
   [DUBBO] Failed to save registry store file, cause: No space left on device, dubbo version: 2.0.1, current host: 10.14.129.133
   java.io.IOException: No space left on device

   ```
2. When the device is full, the `doSaveProperties` method is repeatedly retried, leading to an infinite loop of warning logs.

Please provide the [GitHub address] to reproduce this issue.

#### Expected Result
The version check should prevent the `doSaveProperties` method from being called when the device is full, thus avoiding excessive CPU usage.

#### Actual Result
When the device is full, the `doSaveProperties` method is continuously retried, consuming a large amount of CPU time.
