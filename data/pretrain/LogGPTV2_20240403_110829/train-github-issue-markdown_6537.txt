### Issue Description

I am experiencing a `numpy` error when trying to install `scipy` and `pandas`. The error appears to be related to `numpy`, as I encounter the same issue with both packages. I have attempted to reinstall `numpy` and Python, but the problem persists.

#### System Details
- **Platform**: IBM i
- **numpy Version**: 1.14.4 (installed via `pip3`)
- **Python Version**: 3.6.5-1 (installed via `yum`)

#### Error Output

```bash
-bash-4.3$ pip3 install scipy

                               release)
      - `pip install scipy`   (last SciPy release on PyPI)

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Reinstall `numpy`**:
   ```bash
   pip3 uninstall numpy
   pip3 install numpy
   ```

2. **Check for Incompatible Versions**:
   Ensure that the versions of `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pandas` are compatible with each other and with your Python version.

3. **Clean Up Git Repository**:
   If you are working with a `numpy` git repository, try cleaning it up:
   ```bash
   git clean -xdf
   ```

4. **Verify Installation Paths**:
   Ensure that the installation paths are correct and that there are no conflicting installations.

5. **Update Python and Dependencies**:
   Consider updating Python and its dependencies to the latest stable versions, as this may resolve compatibility issues.

6. **Check for Missing Libraries**:
   Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are installed on your system.

7. **Use a Virtual Environment**:
   Create a virtual environment to isolate your project and avoid conflicts with system-wide packages:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   pip install numpy scipy pandas
   ```

If the issue persists after following these steps, please provide additional details about your environment and any further error messages for more specific assistance.
