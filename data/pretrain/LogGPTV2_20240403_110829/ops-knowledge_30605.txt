**User:**
I am looking for a way to programmatically list all available serial ports using Python. Currently, I use the terminal commands `ls /dev/tty.*` or `ls /dev/cu.*` to list the ports and then hardcode them into the `pyserial` class.

**Assistant:**
You can achieve this programmatically in Python by using the `os.listdir` or `glob` modules to list the files in the `/dev` directory, similar to how you would use `ls` in the terminal. For example, you can use the following code snippet to list all potential serial port devices:

```python
import glob

def list_serial_ports():
    # List all files matching the pattern /dev/tty.*
    tty_ports = glob.glob('/dev/tty.*')
    # List all files matching the pattern /dev/cu.*
    cu_ports = glob.glob('/dev/cu.*')
    # Combine both lists and return
    return tty_ports + cu_ports

# Example usage
available_ports = list_serial_ports()
print(available_ports)
```

This approach will give you a list of all files that match the specified patterns, which are likely to be serial ports. However, it's important to note that not every file listed will necessarily correspond to a usable device. This is also true when using the `ls` command in the terminal. If you need to filter out non-usable devices, you may need to implement additional checks, such as attempting to open each port and handling any exceptions.

For a more robust solution, you might consider using a library like `pyserial` which provides a method to list available serial ports. Here is an example using `pyserial`:

```python
import serial.tools.list_ports

def list_available_ports():
    ports = serial.tools.list_ports.comports()
    return [port.device for port in ports]

# Example usage
available_ports = list_available_ports()
print(available_ports)
```

This method will provide a list of available serial ports that are more likely to be usable.
