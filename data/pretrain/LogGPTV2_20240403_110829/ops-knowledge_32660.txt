User: Setup: Python, NDB, the GAE datastore. I'm trying to make sure i understand some of the constraints around my data model and its tradeoffs for consistency and max-write-rate. Is there any way to test/benchmark this on staging or on my dev box, or should I just bite the bullet, push to prod on a shadow site of sorts, and write a bunch of scripts?
Assistant: I am not sure it can be tested.  The inconsistencies are inconsistent.  I think you just have to know that datastore operations have inconsistencies, and code around them.  You don't want to plan on observations from your tests being dependable in the future.
