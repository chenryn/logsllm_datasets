I'm working on a library using TypeScript called monapt. I have a grunt task
to compile multiple files and concatenate them together. However, the output
definition has some potential downsides. (I can't remember exactly what they
are at the moment, but hopefully someone else can shed some light on this)
Here is a common manual fix I need to do every time before release:
