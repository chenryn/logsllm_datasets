User: There is a Web application based on the MVC pattern, please explain the role of the model, view and controller in the MVC pattern.
Assistant: MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a common application design pattern, which divides the application into three components: model (Model), view (View) and controller (Controller). Model (Model) is the core component in the application, and its responsibility is to represent and manage data. In MVC mode, it acquires and saves data through database, network API or other methods, and provides data operation interface. The model notifies the view and controller what data has changed in order to update the UI interface or perform other operations. View (View) is the presentation of the user interface, and its responsibility is to display data on the screen. In the MVC pattern, the view is responsible for presenting the data of the model to the user, and can accept the user's operation instructions, such as form submission or UI control interaction. The view cooperates with the model and the controller to update the UI interface or perform other operations. The controller (Controller) is the coordinator of the MVC pattern, which controls the workflow of the application by coordinating the communication between the view and the model. The controller responds to the user's operation events, such as mouse clicks and keyboard input, and requests the model to operate on the data, and outputs the results to the view. At the same time, the controller can also update the data in the model so that the view can update the UI interface.
