**Abstract:**
We propose a taxonomy of botnet structures based on their utility to the botmaster. We introduce key metrics to measure the utility of these structures for various activities, such as spam and DDoS attacks. Using these performance metrics, we evaluate the effectiveness of different response techniques in degrading or disrupting botnets. Our models show that targeted responses are particularly effective against scale-free botnets, but efforts to increase the robustness of these networks come at the cost of reduced transitivity. We also demonstrate that random graph botnets (e.g., those using P2P formations) are highly resistant to both random and targeted responses. We use simulations to assess the impact of responses on different topologies and perform novel measurements of a P2P network to validate our proposed metrics. Our analysis provides a framework for classifying botnets by structure and prioritizing remediation strategies.

## 1. Introduction

Malware authors often harness the resources of compromised machines to create botnets, which present unique challenges for researchers. To fully understand the threat posed by these networks, it is essential to identify classes of botnet topologies, their potential uses, and the challenges each class presents for detection and remediation. Simply enumerating observed botnets is insufficient, as they are highly dynamic. For example, botnet sizes have shifted from large networks with over 100,000 victims to numerous smaller botnets with 1,000 to 5,000 victims [53]. Similarly, there has been a rapid transition from centralized botnets (e.g., IRC) to distributed organizational structures (e.g., P2P) [60].

To address this evolving threat, we must consider the structural and organizational potential of botnets. This paper proposes a taxonomy of botnet organization and their utility for various malicious activities. Future botnet research will likely aim to reduce the utility of botnets for botmasters, raising important questions about how botnets are utilized and what metrics should be used to measure the effectiveness of remediation efforts.

Recent work by Rajab et al. [47] highlighted the need for better-defined metrics in botnet research. Their study examined problems in estimating botnet populations, and this paper argues that other metrics, such as bandwidth, communication efficiency, and robustness, require similar thoughtful examination.

This paper proposes a taxonomy of botnet topologies based on the utility of their communication structures and corresponding metrics. Section 2 details metrics for measuring botnet uses and describes their structural organization. In Section 3, we demonstrate how to measure selected metrics and analyze experimental response techniques designed to address specific classes of botnets. We discuss the relationship of our work to other areas of inquiry in Section 4. Given the rapidly changing nature of this field, we conclude with suggestions for future work in Section 5.

Our contributions include identifying likely structural forms for botnets based on a utilitarian analysis, proposing metrics for measuring a botnet's effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness, and analyzing models and real-world observations to suggest that some botnet structures are more resilient than others to different types of remediation efforts. This analysis can guide future research into addressing the botnet problem.

## 2. Botnet Taxonomy

### 2.1 Purpose and Goals

Taxonomies are most useful when they classify threats in dimensions that correspond to potential defenses [30, 31]. As noted in [29], an important goal for an attack taxonomy is to assist defenders. Our botnet taxonomy aims to help researchers identify the most effective responses against different types of botnets. Our design goals are similar to those in [57]: (a) assist defenders in identifying possible types of botnets, and (b) describe key properties of botnet classes to focus efforts on beneficial response technologies.

Our taxonomy is driven by possible responses rather than detection. While there is initial work on botnet detection [13–15, 17, 18, 20], and significant literature on worm detection that can be adapted to botnet detection [9, 21, 26, 44, 58, 61–63], we leave the classification of botnet detection techniques for future work.

### 2.2 Key Metrics for Botnet Structures

Naively, one might assume that bots organize according to regular network topologies like star, mesh, or bus networks. However, these topologies do not adequately describe the utility of large, complex botnets. Instead, we need to focus on key discriminators that allow us to compare important attributes of botnets. We identify three important measures: effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. While botmasters may desire other characteristics, such as anonymity, these are not easily designed into the topology and depend more on the application-layer design of the botnet's messaging system.

Table 1 lists several botnet uses and their key relevant metrics. More than one metric can be relevant to a botnet use, and botnets often have multiple uses. The table highlights key metrics critical to the botnet's specified function.

| **Major Botnet Utilities** | **Effectiveness** | **Efficiency** | **Robustness** |
|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Key Metrics**           | Giant portion     | Diameter      | Local transitivity |
|                           | Average available bandwidth | | |
| **Suggested Variables**   | S                | l−1           | γ              |
| **Comment**               | Large numbers of victims increase the likelihood of high-bandwidth bots. Diurnal behavior favors S over total population. | Bots sending messages to each other and coordinating activities require efficient communications. | Bots maintaining state (e.g., keycracking or mirroring files) require redundancy to guard against random loss. Highly transitive networks are more robust. |

### 2.3 Measuring Botnet Effectiveness

The effectiveness of a botnet is an estimate of its overall utility for a given purpose. While botmasters may innovate new uses, the ability of a botnet to meet existing uses such as spam, DDoS, warez distribution, and phishing is roughly approximated by size and bandwidth.

#### 2.3.1 Size and Bandwidth

We agree with [47] that "botnet size" must be a qualified term. Here, we refer to the "giant component" of the botnet, which is the largest connected (or online) portion of the graph [10, 42]. Botnets are more powerful if they have a large infected population, but the giant component allows us to directly measure the potential damage caused by certain botnet functions.

For DDoS, the giant component, S, measures the largest number of bots that can receive instructions and participate in an attack. This contrasts with the total population of all infected victims, which may not always be reachable by the botmaster due to diurnal variations [16].

A related measure is the average amount of bandwidth that a bot can contribute, denoted as B. Estimating bandwidth along a single link is complex, and the cumulative bandwidth of an entire botnet is even more challenging. By average bandwidth, B, we mean the cumulative available bandwidth in a bot that a botmaster could generate under ideal circumstances. This measurement varies with the distribution of bandwidth available to each member of the botnet, the probability that any victim is online at any given time, and the amount of bandwidth already being consumed by the victims themselves.

We classify three types of bots according to their transit categories:
- Type 1: Modem
- Type 2: DSL/Cable
- Type 3: High-speed networks

While bandwidth within each class is highly variable, this grouping is a reasonable first approximation. The probability of a bot belonging to type i is denoted as Pi. According to [24], a reasonable distribution for US-based bots could be estimated as P1 = 0.3, P2 = 0.6, P3 = 0.1. Similar distributions can be inferred for a global population.

Let Mi be the average maximum network bandwidth within each type, and Ai be the average normal usage of bandwidth within each type. Thus, the average available bandwidth that a botmaster can use on a bot is Mi − Ai. We simplify our measurement by assuming a botmaster would not use more bandwidth than this, as it would interfere with the victim's existing use and potentially alert them to the infection.

We also need to consider the diurnal sensitivity of these networks. More complete diurnal models of bot behavior were presented in [16]. To avoid modeling diurnal changes in numerous time zones, we use a simplified metric based on the estimated number of hours a victim is online per day. We assign different weights (denoting the distribution of time hosts are online each day) to each class of bots. For example, if we assume average online hours per day for a bot using a modem is 2, for a bot with DSL/cable is 6, and for a bot with high-speed is 24, then we have the probability vector (cid:3)W = [2/32, 6/32, 24/32] = [0.0625, 0.1875, 0.75]. These numbers are based on [43], but our analysis considers other ranges of values.

Using the simplified bandwidth estimation for each bot and a simplified diurnal model, we can express the average available bandwidth of a bot as:

\[
B = \sum_{i=1}^{3} (M_i - A_i) P_i W_i
\]

In Section 3, we compare the utility of this metric by evaluating different botnets. The weights and distribution of hosts in each class are variable. To understand their sensitivity, we evaluated the weighted bandwidth for different ranges of estimates.

Figure 1 shows the weighted bandwidth with different variations in diurnal sensitivity. In Figure 1(a), the final average weighted bandwidth is around 20Kbps for a single bot, for the values fixed in that plot. With approximately 50,000 such bots in a botnet, the botmaster can utilize about 1Gbps bandwidth on average at any time. The parameters for the plots in Figure 1 are drawn from data measurements described in Section 3.

The plots reveal the sensitivity of this metric to diurnal variation in users. For example, in Figure 1(a), where low-bandwidth users are presumed online for only two hours, compared to Figure 1(c), where six hours is fixed instead. For diurnal weighing above 6 hours/day, variation in the online hours for medium and high-bandwidth users does not result in much variation in the overall bandwidth, as shown in Figure 1(a). However, in Figure 1(c), the online variation of the other classes has a significant impact on bandwidth, particularly when higher-speed users are "always on" and have a diurnal weight of 1. This suggests that botnets with many low-speed connections experience less variation when the lower-speed connections minimize their time online.

In Section 3, we further compare the estimated bandwidth of two botnets.

### 2.4 Measuring Botnet Efficiency

Botmasters and security researchers may also be concerned about the efficiency of a botnet. Whether used to forward command-and-control messages, update bot executable code, or gather host-based information (e.g., keylogging and data exfiltration), a botnet can be evaluated by its communication efficiency.

We propose network diameter as one means of expressing this efficiency. By network diameter, we mean the average geodesic length of a network, l. This measures the average length of the shortest edge connecting any two nodes in the network. If l is large, the dynamics of the network (communications, information, epidemics) are slow.
