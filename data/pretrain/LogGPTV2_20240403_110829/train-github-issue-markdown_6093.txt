### Issue Description

Material-UI provides a mechanism to detect the device's screen size and render content accordingly. However, the documentation does not specify any method for determining the device or screen orientation within the Grid component.

I have reviewed the existing issues in this repository and believe that this request is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior

Material-UI should provide an attribute within the Grid component or introduce a new component that allows users to determine the device's orientation. This would enable developers to create layouts that adapt not only to the screen size but also to the screen orientation (portrait or landscape).

### Technical Details
- **Material-UI Version:** 1.0.0-beta.16
- **React Version:** 15.3.0

This enhancement would greatly improve the flexibility of responsive design in Material-UI, allowing for more sophisticated and user-friendly layouts.
