Material-UI provides a way to know the device size and perform rendering based
on screen size. However, documentation doesn't detail any way that indicates
that Grid is device/screen orientation aware.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Material UI should expose an attribute within grid content or make a component
available to the user that would allow one to know the device orientation.
This would allow one to know create a layout based on screen orientation in
addition to device size.
