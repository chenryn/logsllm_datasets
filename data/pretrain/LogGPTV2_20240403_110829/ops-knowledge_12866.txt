User: For a large-scale database system, please provide a feasible horizontal expansion solution (Horizontal Scaling).
Assistant: A feasible horizontal expansion solution is to adopt a distributed database architecture and use data sharding technology. The specific implementation can take the following steps: 1. Split the database into multiple independent shards, and each shard only saves part of the data, such as splitting according to user ID or geographic location. 2. Use cluster technology to deploy shards on multiple servers, and each server becomes a node. 3. The client's request is distributed to each node through the load balancer to realize horizontal concurrent processing of data. 4. Introduce a transaction manager to coordinate distributed transactions to ensure data consistency. Under this architecture, the performance and capacity of the database can be expanded by adding nodes to ensure high availability and scalability of the system. At the same time, data sharding technology can evenly distribute data on each node, avoiding the risk of single point failure. In addition, through a reasonable fragmentation strategy, query efficiency can be improved and data redundancy can be reduced.
