While sitting with @stefanv last week we discussed (and then @stefanv started
implementing) sparse array classes that use the same code as the existing
matrix classes, but instead satisfy the ndarray interface (only up to two
dimensions). For example slicing out rows would result in 1d arrays rather
than 2d matrices, the `*` operator means elementwise multiply rather than
matrix multiply, etc..
This would be valuable for a number of communities and, in particular, anyone
trying to use sparse arrays and numpy arrays interchangably, as happens in
Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Dask.array.
I thought I'd raise this issue to track this work (and also to subtly prod
@stefanv).
