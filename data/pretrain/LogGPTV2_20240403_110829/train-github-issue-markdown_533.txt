Last week, during a discussion with @stefanv, we explored the idea of developing sparse array classes that would utilize the same codebase as the existing matrix classes but adhere to the ndarray interface (limited to up to two dimensions). For instance, slicing out rows from these sparse arrays would yield 1D arrays rather than 2D matrices. Additionally, the `*` operator would perform element-wise multiplication instead of matrix multiplication.

This initiative holds significant value for various communities, particularly those aiming to use sparse arrays and NumPy arrays interchangeably, such as in projects like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Dask.array.

I am raising this issue to track the progress of this work and to gently nudge @stefanv to continue his efforts. I am also including @NelleV and @njsmith in this conversation.
