defined. We also view this work as a preliminary exploration
in formally defining security for censorship circumvention
systems with several avenues of potential future work, some
of which we discuss below.
Active security. Our security notion only considers passive
eavesdroppers, and thus does not capture attacks that aim
to modify messages on the wire, or capture active probing
attacks, a technique that real-world censors use to identify cir-
cumvention systems. Thus, developing equivalent formalisms
for active adversaries is important for bringing our security
notions “closer to practice”.
The multi-instance setting. Our security notion only consid-
ers a single connection between Source and Sink; however,
in practice, an application may make multiple connections,
composed arbitrarily. Take for instance web browsing, where
a web browser often opens up a large number of parallel
connections to a web server. Extending our security notion to
handle this multi-instance setting is of particular importance,
especially as it comes to more accurately modeling systems
such as Balboa [6].
Covert signaling. Similar to the standard cryptographic notion
of key-exchange, an important concept that we do not touch
upon is that of establishing a covert channel over an overt
channel. This is of particular importance within the refraction
networking literature, which is largely concerned with covert
signaling. We believe that proper treatment of this primitive
and how it composes with an established covert channel is
necessary to provide a complete methodology for building
covert channels.
