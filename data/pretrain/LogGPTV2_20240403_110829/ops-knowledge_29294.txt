User: I'm using full text search and I'd like to search for items that have a property with value 'C+'
is there a way I can escape the '+' Char so that this search would work?
Assistant: It might help to include the code in question, but try putting a \ before the +, that's what can escape things within quotes in python, so it might work here. E.g.: C\+
