I found the following odd with `@ImportResource` usage:
  1. The `@ImportResource` ResourceLoader does not appear to be the same ResourceLoader as the ApplicationContext. I am using a AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext, and I got classpath-relative resources by default.
  2. Configuration-class relative resource resolution does not work, and one might expect it to. For example, if I import `@ImportResource`("mvc-interceptors.xml") from the com.springsource.greenhouse.config.mvc package, I'd expect "mvc-interceptors.xml" to be in that package, and not the root of the classpath. Having to specify "com/springsource/greenhouse/config/mvc/mvc-interceptors.xml" is a lot more to type and feels strange.
