When the TypeScript target is set to ES6, a conflict arises between `es6-shim.d.ts` and `lib.es6.d.ts`.

To resolve this issue, you can either:
1. Remove `es6-shim.d.ts` if you are not using any polyfills from it, as `lib.es6.d.ts` already includes the necessary type definitions.
2. If you need to use `es6-shim`, consider setting the TypeScript target to a lower version (e.g., ES5) or adjust your project configuration to avoid the conflict.

This ensures that your TypeScript project remains consistent and free of type definition conflicts.
