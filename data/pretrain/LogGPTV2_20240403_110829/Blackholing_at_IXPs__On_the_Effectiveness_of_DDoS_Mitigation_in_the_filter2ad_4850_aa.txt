Abstract. DDoS attacks remain a serious threat not only to the edge
of the Internet but also to the core peering links at Internet Exchange
Points (IXPs). Currently, the main mitigation technique is to blackhole
traﬃc to a speciﬁc IP preﬁx at upstream providers. Blackholing is an
operational technique that allows a peer to announce a preﬁx via BGP
to another peer, which then discards traﬃc destined for this preﬁx. How-
ever, as far as we know there is only anecdotal evidence of the success of
blackholing.
Largely unnoticed by research communities, IXPs have deployed
blackholing as a service for their members. In this ﬁrst-of-its-kind study,
we shed light on the extent to which blackholing is used by the IXP
members and what eﬀect it has on traﬃc.
Within a 12 week period we found that traﬃc to more than 7, 864
distinct IP preﬁxes was blackholed by 75 ASes. The daily patterns
emphasize that there are not only a highly variable number of new
announcements every day but, surprisingly, there are a consistently high
number of announcements (> 1000). Moreover, we highlight situations
in which blackholing succeeds in reducing the DDoS attack traﬃc.
1 Introduction
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are and will continue to be a serious
threat to the Internet. Indeed, the intensity and the dimension of such attacks
is still rising, in particular due to ampliﬁcation and reﬂection attacks [7,32,33].
DDoS attacks impact not only edge networks but can also overwhelm cloud
services [36] or congest backbone peering links at Internet Exchange Points
(IXP) [30]. Various DDoS detection and defense mechanisms strive to dimin-
ish the impact of attack traﬃc on the victim’s infrastructure while minimiz-
ing the collateral damage to legitimate traﬃc. While there has been some
progress towards limiting ampliﬁcation [19], DDoS attacks remain a major secu-
rity challenge as new protocol or implementation weaknesses are identiﬁed almost
daily [38].
Various taxonomies [18,23,37] distinguish between proactive (preventive) and
reactive techniques. Among the reactive defenses, we distinguish between source-
based, destination-based, and network-based [39] mechanisms depending on where

they are deployed. In this paper, we focus on how blackholing – a network-based
reactive defense mechanism – is used at IXPs.
The term blackhole originates in physics and describes an object with such
a strong gravitation that nothing can escape from it. In networking it refers to
situations where IP packets are silently discarded, often due to misconﬁgura-
tion. Indeed, since the late-1980s, blackholing has been used – on a per device
basis – to counter DDoS attacks [13]. In 2002, Greene [12] proposed to extend
blackholing to routers within an Autonomous System (AS) via iBGP communi-
ties, see RFC 3882. In eBGP, an AS is able to communicate to another AS for
which preﬁx the packets should be dropped via BGP communities [5]. In 2009,
Kumari and McPherson extended the community ranges to include dropping by
source addresses, see RFC 5635. Major Internet Service Providers (ISP), e.g.,
DT, NTT, and Hurricane Electric, use blackholing within their network and
have been oﬀering blackholing services since between 2005 and 2007 to their
customers [9,15,27].
However, the use of eBGP blackholing services by a DDoS victim is not
trivial as the victim has to contact its direct neighbors. The signaling has to
be done on a per neighbor basis. IXPs simplify this by acting as a proxy. They
oﬀer a public peering infrastructure and the major IXPs have more than 500
member ASes. Due to this multiplication factor, IXPs are in principle convenient
locations for blackholing. First ad hoc uses of blackholing occurred around 2010.
The blackholing feature is now available at some major IXPs such as DE-CIX,
MSK-IX, NETIX, NIX.CZ, and TPIX [8,25,26].
In this paper, we rely on three month’s worth of routing and traﬃc mea-
surements from one of the largest IXPs worldwide to examine the extent of
blackholing usage and its eﬀectiveness. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant number of black-
holes announced, mainly /32 but also less speciﬁc. Indeed, the usage considerably
depends on the preﬁx length and the announcing member AS. Furthermore, we
reveal that blackholing succeeds in reducing DDoS attack traﬃc.
2 Blackholing at IXPs
Blackholing is used as a DDoS mitigation strategy inside a single or between
multiple ASes. Consequently, the victim AS announces the attacked destination
IP preﬁx upstream network via BGP. Traﬃc towards these preﬁxes is discarded
upstream, usually at the upstream AS ingress point. This reduces the amount
of traﬃc not only for the destination network but also for all upstream ASes.
Historically, blackholing was implemented at the edge routers of an AS. How-
ever, over time it was moving from the edge (customer or provider networks) to
the core of the Internet (ISPs and IXPs).
IXPs: IXPs are shared and settlement free peering platforms that operate a
switching fabric to interconnect its members’ networks. Among the member
ASes that exchange traﬃc are typically a wide range of network types, e.g.,
Tier-1 ISPs, regional providers, hosters, content providers, CDNs, and even
IXP resellers. Many IXPs oﬀer route servers as a free value-added service [31].

It greatly simpliﬁes the BGP session management for their connected members.
Therefore, route servers collect routing information in a centralized manner and
redistribute them to connected member routers.
If an IXP-connected network (AS) is hit by a massive DDoS attack that
causes large amounts of ingress traﬃc over the IXP link, either the network itself
or the network interconnection link is at risk of congestion. As a last resort, either
operators of the targeted AS can trigger blackholing for its own preﬁxes or black-
holing is triggered on the behalf of the preﬁx owner, e.g., through its upstream
AS. Both scenarios render the attacked network unreachable for attackers and
for everyone else.
Explanatory Example Scenario: Fig. 1 depicts the traﬃc ﬂow process at an
IXP prior (A) and after (B) the activation of blackholing. The initial situation
is that a member (AS1) receives traﬃc from its peers and while AS2 sends
solely legitimate traﬃc (1), AS3 traﬃc contains signiﬁcant amounts of DDoS
traﬃc (2). Now AS1’s IXP-connected router advertises the attacked preﬁx –
usually a more speciﬁc – for blackholing towards the route server (3). This can
be done either explicitly, i.e., using a BGP next hop with a predeﬁned blackholing
IP address, or implicitly, i.e., via a well-known BGP community. The community
is then translated to the next hop blackholing IP address at the route server.
All connected members receive the BGP update, learn the new BGP next hop
address for the announced preﬁx, choose it as best path since it is more speciﬁc,
and send their traﬃc to the blackholing IP.
The IXP handles this IP address and resolves it by means of the ARP into
a predeﬁned blackholing MAC address. All Ethernet frames with this destina-
tion MAC are discarded via ACL at the IXP layer-2 ingress switch interfaces
(4). Note, this process is non-transparent for the traﬃc source, e.g., attacker.
All other announced preﬁxes remain unaﬀected (5), but may do not suﬀer from
congestions anymore. In cases where the DDoS traﬃc is mainly coming from a
certain member’s networks, the so-called policy control feature of route servers
can be used to limit blackholing only to those ASes. In general, policy con-
trol allows the deﬁnition of white- and blacklists for BGP announcements by a
322
C. Dietzel et al.
well-deﬁned set of BGP communities. These communities are interpreted by the
route server.
Blackholing Usage: The implementation of blackholing at IXPs is beneﬁcial
because: (i) route servers disentangle the conﬁguration process for triggering
blackholing. A single route update can address all members at once. (ii) The
large number of networks that meet at the IXP also increase the eﬀectiveness.
(iii) Given the central position in the Internet, blackholing at IXPs allows the
alleviation of the impact closer to the attack source. (iv) It can protect the
intermediate networks on the path through the Internet, but it is far enough
from the source to be eﬃcient.
However, while blackholing at IXPs shields member networks and the links
from congestions, it cannot distinguish between legitimate and malicious traﬃc.
All packets destined for the deﬁned IP preﬁx are dropped and, thus, it is not
reachable from all upstream networks on the data path.
Moreover, after detecting a massive DDoS attack, the operator must trigger
blackholing. This is a manual process where the router conﬁguration must be
adjusted in order to announce via BGP an IP preﬁx under attack. Typically,
a more speciﬁc IP preﬁx is announced to limit the impact on benign traﬃc to
the minimum. The triggering AS is not necessarily the owner of the IP preﬁx.
Thus, the announcing member must register this preﬁx in the IRR database to
be accepted by the IXP.
3 Data Sources
In this paper, we rely on the following datasets from one of the largest European
IXPs [6]. This IXP serves around 600 members and peaks to over 4 Tbit/s in
2015.
We used 5-minute interval snapshots from a publicly accessible looking glass
at the IXP route servers to gather the BGP announcements for long-term con-
trol plane analysis. The announcements for blackholing can be discriminated
by means of a well-deﬁned next hop IP. Due to the sampling frequency, only
announced preﬁxes that were active at these moments can be captured. Short-
term new and withdrawn announcements are not caught. If a previously active
preﬁx was absent in one measurement we considered it as a new announce-
ment when it reappears. The data covers a 3-month period from December 2014
onward. From this dataset we identify 22,994 blackholing BGP announcements
(after excluding measurement and looking glass outages, etc.)
To understand the impact of blackholing on the traﬃc ﬂow, we rely on IPFIX
data from the IXPs switching fabric for the same period. IPFIX at the IXP is
conﬁgured to randomly capture 1 out of 10,000 packets on every member link.
The IPFIX data contains the MAC and IP addresses, IP protocol identiﬁer,
TCP/UDP port numbers, and length of the captured packets. For statements
about traﬃc volumes we extrapolate from the sampled ﬂows.
In addition we use route server and IPFIX data for policy control veriﬁcation
and a case study from July 2015.

4 Blackholing: A Usage Analysis
In this section, we elaborate on how blackholing is used in the wild from a con-
trol plane perspective. For the remainder of this paper the term “announcement”
refers to BGP announcements that trigger blackholing. Additionally, all nota-
tions about IP preﬁxes refer to blackholed IP preﬁxes if not otherwise stated.
4.1 A Preﬁx View of Blackholing
The IXP’s route server accepts BGP advertised blackholes with a preﬁx length n,
with /32 ≤ n ≤ /8. We ﬁnd that only preﬁxes ≥ /18 are announced by the IXP
members. Figure 2(a) shows the distribution of unique announcements (y-axis in
log-scale) per preﬁx length. The mode on the far right indicates that mainly /32
preﬁxes are blackholed, indeed more than 97 % of all announcements. Another
mode is between /24 and /30, which accounts for 2.5 %. Preﬁxes with the length
of ≤ /23 account for a very small fraction, namely 9 announcements (0.5 %). In
summary, mostly host routes are used for blackholing.
Due to the employment of the policy control feature at the route server,
preﬁxes are not necessarily announced to all peers. We randomly sampled the
route server’s RIB four times with a seven day interval. On average 25 % of all
announcements carry a policy control community that limits its propagation.
