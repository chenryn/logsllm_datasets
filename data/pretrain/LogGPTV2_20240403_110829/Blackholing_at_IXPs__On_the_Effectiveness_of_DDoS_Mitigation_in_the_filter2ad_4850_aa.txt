## Abstract
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat not only to the edge of the Internet but also to core peering links at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). The primary mitigation technique currently in use is blackholing, which involves discarding traffic destined for a specific IP prefix at upstream providers. Despite its widespread adoption, there is limited empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

In this pioneering study, we investigate the extent to which IXP members utilize blackholing and its impact on traffic. Over a 12-week period, we observed that traffic to more than 7,864 distinct IP prefixes was blackholed by 75 Autonomous Systems (ASes). Our analysis reveals a highly variable number of new announcements each day, with a consistently high number of active announcements (> 1000). We also highlight scenarios where blackholing successfully reduces DDoS attack traffic.

## 1. Introduction
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to be a major security challenge, with their intensity and scale increasing due to amplification and reflection techniques. These attacks not only affect edge networks but can also overwhelm cloud services and congest backbone peering links at IXPs. Various detection and defense mechanisms aim to mitigate the impact of attack traffic while minimizing collateral damage to legitimate traffic. While progress has been made in limiting amplification, DDoS attacks remain a significant threat as new vulnerabilities are discovered frequently.

Taxonomies distinguish between proactive and reactive defenses. Reactive defenses can be source-based, destination-based, or network-based, depending on their deployment. This paper focuses on blackholing, a network-based reactive defense mechanism, and its usage at IXPs.

Blackholing, originally a physics term, refers to the silent discarding of IP packets, often due to misconfiguration. Since the late-1980s, it has been used to counter DDoS attacks. In 2002, Greene proposed extending blackholing to routers within an AS via iBGP communities (RFC 3882). In eBGP, an AS can communicate to another AS to drop packets for a specific prefix using BGP communities. In 2009, Kumari and McPherson extended community ranges to include dropping by source addresses (RFC 5635). Major ISPs, such as DT, NTT, and Hurricane Electric, have offered blackholing services since 2005-2007.

However, using eBGP blackholing requires the victim to contact its direct neighbors, making it cumbersome. IXPs simplify this by acting as a proxy, offering public peering infrastructure and serving over 500 member ASes. Some major IXPs, including DE-CIX, MSK-IX, NETIX, NIX.CZ, and TPIX, now offer blackholing services.

In this study, we analyze three months of routing and traffic data from one of the largest IXPs to examine the extent and effectiveness of blackholing. We find a significant number of blackholes announced, primarily /32 prefixes, and demonstrate that blackholing effectively reduces DDoS attack traffic.

## 2. Blackholing at IXPs
Blackholing is used as a DDoS mitigation strategy within a single AS or between multiple ASes. The victim AS announces the attacked destination IP prefix upstream via BGP, and traffic towards these prefixes is discarded at the upstream AS ingress point. This reduces traffic not only for the destination network but also for all upstream ASes.

Historically, blackholing was implemented at the edge routers of an AS. However, it has moved from the edge to the core of the Internet, including ISPs and IXPs.

### 2.1. IXPs and Route Servers
IXPs are shared, settlement-free peering platforms that interconnect member networks. Members include Tier-1 ISPs, regional providers, hosters, content providers, CDNs, and IXP resellers. Many IXPs offer route servers as a free value-added service, simplifying BGP session management by collecting and redistributing routing information in a centralized manner.

### 2.2. Explanatory Example Scenario
Figure 1 illustrates the traffic flow process at an IXP before and after blackholing. Initially, a member (AS1) receives traffic from its peers, with AS2 sending legitimate traffic and AS3 sending significant DDoS traffic. AS1's IXP-connected router then advertises the attacked prefix for blackholing to the route server. This can be done explicitly using a BGP next hop with a predefined blackholing IP address or implicitly via a well-known BGP community. The route server translates the community to the next hop blackholing IP address, and all connected members receive the BGP update, learn the new BGP next hop address, and send their traffic to the blackholing IP. The IXP discards Ethernet frames with this destination MAC address via ACL at the layer-2 ingress switch interfaces. All other announced prefixes remain unaffected, but may no longer suffer from congestion.

### 2.3. Benefits of Blackholing at IXPs
Implementing blackholing at IXPs is beneficial because:
- Route servers simplify the configuration process, allowing a single route update to address all members.
- The large number of interconnected networks increases the effectiveness.
- The central position in the Internet allows the alleviation of the impact closer to the attack source.
- It protects intermediate networks on the path through the Internet, while being far enough from the source to be efficient.

However, blackholing cannot distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic, and all packets destined for the defined IP prefix are dropped. After detecting a DDoS attack, the operator must manually trigger blackholing by adjusting the router configuration to announce the attacked IP prefix via BGP. Typically, a more specific IP prefix is announced to minimize the impact on benign traffic. The announcing member must register this prefix in the IRR database to be accepted by the IXP.

## 3. Data Sources
This study relies on datasets from one of the largest European IXPs, which serves around 600 members and peaks at over 4 Tbit/s. We used 5-minute interval snapshots from a publicly accessible looking glass at the IXP route servers to gather BGP announcements for long-term control plane analysis. Announcements for blackholing can be identified by a well-defined next hop IP. The dataset covers a 3-month period from December 2014, and we identified 22,994 blackholing BGP announcements.

To understand the impact on traffic flow, we used IPFIX data from the IXP switching fabric for the same period. IPFIX is configured to randomly capture 1 out of 10,000 packets on every member link, containing MAC and IP addresses, IP protocol identifier, TCP/UDP port numbers, and packet length. For traffic volume statements, we extrapolate from the sampled flows. We also used route server and IPFIX data for policy control verification and a case study from July 2015.

## 4. Blackholing: A Usage Analysis
In this section, we analyze how blackholing is used in the wild from a control plane perspective. The term "announcement" refers to BGP announcements that trigger blackholing, and all notations about IP prefixes refer to blackholed IP prefixes unless otherwise stated.

### 4.1. A Prefix View of Blackholing
The IXP's route server accepts BGP advertised blackholes with a prefix length \( n \), where \( /32 \leq n \leq /8 \). We found that only prefixes \( \geq /18 \) are announced by IXP members. Figure 2(a) shows the distribution of unique announcements per prefix length, with the majority being /32 prefixes (97% of all announcements). Another mode is between /24 and /30, accounting for 2.5%. Prefixes with lengths \( \leq /23 \) account for a very small fraction (0.5%).

Due to the policy control feature at the route server, prefixes are not necessarily announced to all peers. We randomly sampled the route server's RIB four times with a seven-day interval. On average, 25% of all announcements carry a policy control community that limits their propagation.

Figure 2(b) shows the announcements per day, clustered by prefix length over a three-month period. We distinguish between new announcements per day and active announcements on average per day. Unexpectedly, the total number of active announcements remains consistently high.

## Conclusion
This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of blackholing usage and effectiveness at IXPs. We found that blackholing is widely used, with a significant number of announcements, primarily /32 prefixes. Our analysis highlights the consistent and high number of active announcements, and we demonstrate that blackholing effectively reduces DDoS attack traffic. Future work will focus on further refining the understanding of blackholing's impact and exploring additional mitigation strategies.
