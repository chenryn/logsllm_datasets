The CylinderBufferGeometry constructor produces doubled vertices and normals
in the places where a ring is closed. This could result in wrong shading (one
non-smoothed edge), in the screenshot only for demonstrating purposes forced
by a call of computeVertexNormals().

Wouldn't it be cleaner to have no doubled vertices/normals at all on the
sides? The duplication could easily be avoided in the constructor (by only
doubling a row’s start index in the index array instead of doubling the vertex
and normal).
But since it’s the same with SphereBufferGeometry and SphereGeometry, I wonder
whether the duplication is perhaps made intentionally for some reason I don’t
know?
