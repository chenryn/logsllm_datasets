The `CylinderBufferGeometry` constructor generates duplicated vertices and normals at the points where a ring is closed. This duplication can lead to incorrect shading, as it may create a non-smoothed edge. For demonstration purposes, this issue is highlighted in the screenshot below, which was forced by calling `computeVertexNormals()`.

Wouldn't it be more efficient to avoid these duplicated vertices and normals on the sides of the cylinder? The duplication could be easily prevented in the constructor by adjusting the index array to only double the start index of a row, rather than duplicating the vertices and normals.

However, since similar duplication is present in `SphereBufferGeometry` and `SphereGeometry`, I am curious whether this duplication is intentional for a reason I am not aware of.
