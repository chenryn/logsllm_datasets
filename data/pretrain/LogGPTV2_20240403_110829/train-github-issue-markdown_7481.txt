Julia 0.5 has removed all support for cloning private repos on Windows. In
previous versions one could always clone private repos via SSH remote URLs,
but support for the git protocol seems entirely removed. Cloning private repos
via https also doesn't work on Windows, I get the following error:
    ERROR: ccall: could not find function getpass

I think there are potentially two solutions:
  1. Re-enable support for the git transport protocol
  2. Fix the error with https connections on Windows (might be enough to fix #8228)
I believe that only having 2) would be very painful, because my understanding
is that every Pkg.update would for example query for the username/password
combo for private repos, i.e. as far as I know there is no support for
credential storage in libgit2, right?
So I think if the git transport is not re-enabled, one would really also need
integration with the git credential manager interface, so that https
credentials that are stored in a registered git credential manager would be
picked up by `Pkg.clone` and `Pkg.update`. My understanding is that libgit2
has no support for this, so it would probably have to be implemented
manually...
I think this issue here should get the 0.5.0 milestone attached. Not being
able to work with private repos is a major regression relative to 0.4 that
would affect essentially anyone who has package work in private repos.
