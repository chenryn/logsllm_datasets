pragmatic and it is based on the objective to create global service systems
descriptions using computer-understandable descriptions.
3.5.1 Implementation Details
As explain in Sect. 3.4, the model was implemented as an RDF vocabulary,
written in Turtle as opposed to XML due to its better readability [5]. To
3.5 Model Implementation 51
improve the integration with other semantic web initiatives, the model estab-
lisheslinkswithvariousexistingontologiestoreuseconceptsfromverticaland
horizontal domains such as SKOS (taxonomies), Dublin Core (documents),
FOAF (people) and so on.
The6-pointinteractionstaractsasthecoreofthemodel.AServiceSystem
class was used to group interactions.
A Role represents customers, managers, computer agents and so on. We
linkaroletoitsrespectivestakeholderswiththepropertybelongsToBusiness-
Entity. The property connects a Role to a BusinessEntity of the ontology
GoodRelations. This ontology was chosen because it is widely accepted as a
valuable Linked Data vocabulary for describing products and services [17].
The class Process represents an internal business process of the service
system.Itisparticularlyusefultofilterinteractionflowsbasedoncertainpro-
cesses. Its usefulness can be improved by connecting it to modelled processes.
Hence,welinkittoaProcessoftheBPMN2.0ontology[30].Infuturework,
connections to di↵erent process modeling vocabularies may be considered, to
expand the usefulness of this class.
TheclassGoalexpressesamotivationfortheoccurrenceoftheinteraction.
This class is not connected to any element of the Linked Data Cloud because
its meaning is contained in the context of its service system. Moreover, no
relevant ontologies were found that could be used to extend the information
of this class.
The class Location expresses where an interaction occurs. An instance of
this element is connected to another through the property isLocatedIn to
obtain a hierarchy level. This enables, for instance, associating an interaction
with a room and finding that interaction when querying the room. It also
has the property isLocationFrom that connects it to a Feature of the on-
tologyGeonames[38].Thisgivesanunambiguousgeographicalcontext,since
a Geonames Feature represents any city, country and so on and also uses a
hierarchy level.
TheconceptTimegivesatemporalcontexttointeractions.Itisconnected
to a TemporalEntity of the OWL-Time ontology [18]. This enables a high
level of detail for temporal descriptions, such as the date and time of an
interaction occurrence by using DateTimeDescription or its duration with
the conceptDurationDescription. It is also possible to define temporal re-
lations between interactions by using properties such as intervalBefore,
intervalEqualsorintervalAfter.Thisenablesalightweightdescriptionof
a process.
The class Resource captures inputs and outputs of the service system.
Thus, an interaction can relate to a resource with the property receives-
Resource when it is being introduced from outside the service system;
createsResourcewhenitiscreatedfromwithintheservicesystem;consumes-
Resource when it is consumed from within the service system and returns-
Resourcewhen it is providedtothe outside of the service system. Aresource

may specify quantities. It can also be connected to Resource from DBpedia
sothatwemaygiveitanunambiguoussemanticelement,i.e.aresource“Let-
ter” might have an ambiguous meaning by itself (e.g., is it a mail letter or a
letter from the alphabet?), but assigning it to a DBpedia Resource gives it
an unambiguous semantic value.
As we previously discussed, Interaction and Resource also have sub-
classes. However, they are not mandatory, and other subclasses may be used
instead. That is possible because they are subclasses of Concept from the
SKOS ontology [19]. This means that they are concepts that can be extended
by concept schemes [29]. Therefore, we can create a ConceptScheme from
SKOS for Interaction and another for Resource, create their subclasses
and add them to their respective concept schemes through SKOS property
hasTopConcept. Similarly, if someone prefers a di↵erent set of subclasses,
they may create a new concept scheme and assign the new subclasses as top
concepts. This capability improves the model’s adaptivity and capacity to
improve.

3.5.2 Integration with the Linked Data Cloud
Another objective, no less important, was to integrate the model with the
Linked Data Cloud. This means that the connection between entities of the
LSS-USDLmodelmusthaveasemanticmeaningwithentitiesoftheLDC.The
integration with the LDC is done by reusing relevant Linked Data ontologies,
such as Geonames or DBpedia.
TheLDCisgeneratingtremendousinterestanduptakebyresearchersand
bytheindustry.ThetermreferstopubliclyavailabledataontheWorldWide
Web in the form of knowledge represented by ontology languages like RDF
andOWL,whichareestablishedstandardsbytheW3Cformetadatasharing
and information integration [11].
Historically,corporateinformationdescribingdataandserviceswasclosed
inside private databases and “firewall”. Linked Data is a recent movement
which use Semantic Web advances to enable organizations to give a remote
access of their internal data and service assets to others. For example, the
US and UK governments already make their legislation available to citizens
inatransparentmannerusingsemanticlanguages.Thesetofallthedatasets
made accessible across the world is called the Linked Data Cloud. Driven
by researchers, government agencies (e.g., govtrack.us and legislation.
gov.uk), and companies (e.g., The Guardian and The National Library of
Germany), the resulting Linked Data alone has grown to over 30 billion RDF
triples.
However, in isolation the value of Linked Data is under-explored. By
matchingvocabulariesdefinedbyLSS-USDLanddataoftheLDC,wewillbe
able to add background knowledge to service systems. For example, this in-
tegration enables to execute queries to find information about specific service
resources annotated with DBpedia concepts (e.g., passport, medical record,
and bill of materials). DBpedia is a repository of structured information re-
trievedforWikipediaandaccessibleasRDFstatements.Asanotherexample,
italsoenablestoretrieveinformation,suchasthecountry,population,postal
code, and alternative names of the locations where services operate using
GeoNames, an ontology with more than 8 million toponyms.
