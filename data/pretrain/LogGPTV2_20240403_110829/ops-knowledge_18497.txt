User: I want to create executable with pyinstaller (in ubuntu). My program works, but when I create executable, program doesn't work. Problem is probably in command os.mkdir. How can I solve it? Thank you.
Assistant: Hmm... If you want to create a directory where you want to store some files, you can create it by using os.system("mkdir $nameOfDirectory$"). Hope this helps, os.system() executes in Terminal the command between the paranthesis.
