### Analysis of SDK Versions and Data Collection

We used LibScout [9] to detect the versions of the SDKs in our app datasets. However, we did not apply LibScout to all apps due to the significant runtime overhead (99.47 seconds per app for 100 randomly tested apps on macOS/Core-i7/16GB RAM).

**Flurry:**
- Out of 353 apps that contacted Flurry, we could not extract SDK version information for 202 apps from their traffic.
- LibScout successfully detected SDK versions for 53 of these 202 apps.
- For 45 out of 190 apps that sent the IMEI, all were using pre-GDPR versions.
- According to Flurry's release notes [28], the feature for IMEI collection was removed in 2016.
- Since we cannot download Flurry SDKs before version 6.2.0 (released in November 2015), it is likely that the undetected versions are pre-6.2.0.
- For the 156 apps that sent GPS, we could detect SDK versions for 151 based on the traffic, and LibScout detected the remaining five, all using current versions of the Flurry SDK.
- The Flurry manual indicates that if an app has GPS permissions, Flurry defaults to sending this data unless the developer explicitly opts out [27].

**my.com:**
- In 42 cases where my.com received at least the MAC with the AAID, 23 ran SDK versions supporting GDPR.
- Documentation is sparse [44], and it is unclear if the default behavior is to collect such data or if the developer must set `setUserConsent` to true first.
- The remaining 19 cases used outdated SDK versions without GDPR support.

**Amazon:**
- 20 out of 30 apps that sent data to Amazon used a current version of the Mobile Ads SDK.

**Unity:**
- All 29 apps that sent the AAID along with the IMEI to Unity used outdated SDKs (released before 2018 when GDPR came into effect).

**Vungle:**
- 16 out of 26 apps that sent GPS with the AAID ran pre-GDPR versions of the library (added in version 6.2.5 [66]).
- The remaining ten apps had version numbers indicating GDPR support, suggesting developers opted into sending the data.

**Overall:**
- Out of 24,838 apps that sent PD to ad-related domains, 2,082 (8.4%) had a pre-GDPR update date (before May 2018).
- The most egregious violations can be attributed to extremely old versions of libraries and the complex configuration required for GDPR and Play Store compliance.

### Comparing the Datasets

**Selection Bias:**
- We filtered long-tail apps through Exodus-Privacy, introducing a selection bias.
- After applying the same filtering to high-profile apps, only 10,799 out of 14,975 high-profile apps would have passed the filtering step.
- This means we would have missed 888 high-profile apps that sent out data if we had pre-filtered them.

**Statistical Analysis:**
- We compared the number of apps in each dataset that sent PD to ad-related domains.
- Null hypothesis (H0): There is no difference between high-profile and long-tail apps in terms of sending PD.
- Using χ², we rejected H0 (p < 0.01), but Cramer’s V (v = 0.0228) indicated a negligible effect [20].
- Kruskal-Wallis test also rejected H0 (p < 0.01) for the number of different types of PD sent out, but ε² = 0.0178 showed a small to negligible effect [20].
- For the number of different types of PD sent out, Kruskal-Wallis showed p = 0.022, but ε² = 0.0002, indicating a significant difference with a negligible effect.

### Developer Notification

**Notification Process:**
- We notified affected developers to inform them about potential GDPR breaches and to understand the underlying reasons.
- We extracted email addresses from the Play Store and sent developers a link to our web interface with technical details and questions.
- The notification was carefully worded to avoid legal consulting, as regulated by German law.

**Response and Updates:**
- Out of 24,838 apps, 7,043 had been removed from the Play Store by the time of notification.
- We sent notifications in two batches, with reminders, and grouped emails for multiple apps from the same developer.
- We notified 11,914 developers responsible for 17,795 apps.
- By February 1, 2021, 2,199 reports were accessed, resulting in 2,791 (15.7%) apps for which we reached the owner.
- 448 distinct senders responded, with varying levels of acknowledgment, disagreement, and plans for action.
- Some developers believed their apps were compliant by default, while others cited resource constraints or lack of understanding.

**Updates to Notified Apps:**
- We re-downloaded and re-analyzed updated versions of 1,075 apps.
- 250 (23%) apps no longer sent PD to ad-related domains without prior consent.
- Of the 136 respondents who planned to update their apps, 92 had been updated, but only 43 did so without sending any data without interaction.
- The low number of updates can be attributed to small development teams and the complexity of integrating consent mechanisms.

### Calls to Action

**Third Parties:**
- Digital content is largely funded by advertising, which relies on continuous data collection and tracking.
- Third parties should take more responsibility for ensuring GDPR compliance, as many developers believe their apps are compliant by default.
- Popular companies like Facebook require developers to obtain user consent but default to collecting user PD such as AAID [23, 24].
- These third parties play a key role in the widespread receiving of PD without explicit consent.

**Conclusion:**
- The sharing of PD with third-party data controllers is pronounced in both high-profile and long-tail apps.
- More than one-third of all tested apps sent PD before any user interaction.
- There is no significant difference between high-profile and long-tail apps in terms of GDPR compliance issues.
- To remedy the situation, third parties should take more responsibility, and developers need better tools and documentation to ensure compliance.
