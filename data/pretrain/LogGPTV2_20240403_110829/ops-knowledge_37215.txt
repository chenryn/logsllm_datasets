User: I've been looking really hard at all of the way**(s)** one can develop web applications using Python.  For reference, we are using RHEL 64bit, apache, mod_wsgi.
History:

PHP + MySQL years ago
PHP + Python 2.x + MySQL recently and current
Python + PostgreSQL working on it

We use a great library for communicating between PHP and Python (interface in PHP, backend in Python)...  However, with a larger upcoming project starting, using 100% python may be very advantagous.
We typically prefer not to have a monolithic framework dictating how things are done.  A collection of useful helpers and utilities are much preferred (be it PHP or Python).
Question 1:
In reading a number of answers from experienced Python users, I've seen Werkzeug recommended a number of times.   I would love it if several people with direct experience using Werkzeug to develop professional web applications could comment (in as much detail as their fingers feel like) why they use it, why they like it, and anything to watch out for.
Question 2:
Is there a version of Werkzeug that supports Python 3.1.1.  I've succefully installed mod_wsgi on Apache 2.2 with Python 3.1.1.
If there is not a version, what would it take to upgrade it to work on Python 3.1?
Note: I've run 2to3 on the Werkzeug source code, and it does python-compile without 
Edit:
The project that we are starting is not slated to be finished until nearly a year from now.  At which point, I'm guessing Python 3.X will be a lot more mainstream.  Furthermore, considering that we are running the App (not distributing it), can anyone comment on the viability of bashing through some of the Python 3 issues now, so that when a year from now arrives, we are more-or-less already there?
Thoughts appreciated!
Assistant: I can only answer question one:
I started using it for some small webstuff but now moved on to rework larger apps with it. Why Werkzeug? The modular concept is really helpful. You can hook in modules as you like, make stuff easily context aware and you get good request file handling for free which is able to cope with 300mb+ files by not storing it in memory.
Disadvantages... Well sometimes modularity needs some upfront thought (django f.ex. gives you everything all at once, stripping stuff out is hard to do there though) but for me it works fine.
