User:  How to set up firewall rules to restrict access to a linux server from a specific ip?
Assistant: 1. View the current firewall status: `sudo firewall-cmd --state` 2. If the firewall status is active, you can disable the firewall first: `sudo systemctl stop firewalld` 3. Create a new firewall zone named "block_ip":` sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=block_ip` 4. Add a rule in the new firewall zone to restrict the access of hosts with IP 192.168.1.1: `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=block_ip --add-source=192.168.1.1 --add-port=22/tcp --add-port=80/tcp` where --add-port is used to specify the port number that needs to be restricted. 5. Finally, enable the new firewall zone: `sudo firewall-cmd --reload` In this way, the host with IP 192.168.1.1 cannot access the restricted ports.
