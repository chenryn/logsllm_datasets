Assistant: The following are the steps to create a virtual machine instance using AWS EC2 and connect to the instance: 1. Log in to the AWS console. 2. Select "EC2" in the service catalog. 3. Click Launch Instance to create an instance. 4. Select the desired AMI (Amazon Machine Image), which is a complete pre-installed operating system and application package. 5. Choose an instance type and an instance configuration. 6. Specify a security group for the instance. Security groups help control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances. 7. Create and select a key pair. A key pair is required to connect to an instance. 8. Click "Launch Instance" to create a new instance. 9. Connect to the instance. Select the instance and click the "Connect" button. 10. In the pop-up window, select the connection method according to the operating system used. SSH connection is usually used for Linux instances, and RDP is used for Windows instances. 11. Authenticate. Connect using the specified key pair. 12. After successfully connecting to the instance, use the command line or FTP client to upload the file. To upload files, you can use tools like scp (on Linux and Mac OS) or WinSCP (on Windows). After connecting to the instance, enter the following command in the terminal to upload the file to the instance: scp /path/to/local/file user@instance-ip:/path/to/remote/file or use tools such as WinSCP to upload files. The above are the steps to use AWS EC2 to create a virtual machine instance and connect to the instance, and briefly describe how to upload files to the instance. It should be noted that when uploading files, security and permission issues need to be considered to ensure that only authorized users can access the files.
