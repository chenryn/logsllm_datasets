On QWERTZ keyboards and their derivates, which are used in Germany,
Switzerland, Austria and most of Central Europe, the key combination for the
`@` symbol is `alt-g q`.
When pressing `alt-g q` in Atom Editor, all lines are reformatted so that they
break at the preferred line length, instead of entering an `@` symbol.
I've gone through all keybindings, but I could not find any for `alt-g q`.
