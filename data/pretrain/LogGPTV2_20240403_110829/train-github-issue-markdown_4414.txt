The following code fails with an error (`numpy.linalg.LinAlgError: SVD did not
converge`). This occurs if:
  * there is this unused import (`import scipy.linalg`)
  * a modulo operation is performed (`x1 % 2`)
This is unexpcected to me, because the modulo operation shouldn't have any
side effects, but even copying the vector won't help.
Another interesting observation is that only the first excecution of
`np.random.multivariate_normal` fails. As a workaround I could just catch the
first exception and run it again:
    try:
        sample = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.zeros(len(points)), cov)
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError as e:
        print("First try failed:", e)
    sample = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.zeros(len(points)), cov)
I was able to reproduce this error another windows pc with anaconda python,
but not on linux.
### Reproducing code example:
    import numpy as np
    # this unused import is important to reproduce the weird side effect of modulo calculation
    import scipy.linalg
    def k(x1, x2):
        base = np.pi * (x1[:, None, :] - x2[None, :, :])
        exp_dist = np.exp(-0.5 * np.sum(np.square(np.sin(base)), axis=-1))
        # the following statement shouldn't have any side effects
        x1 % 2
        #np.mod(x1, 2)
        #np.mod(x1.copy(), 2)
        return exp_dist
    n = 10
    points = np.atleast_2d(np.linspace(0, 360, 10)).T
    cov = k(points, points)
    np.random.multivariate_normal(np.zeros(len(points)), cov)
