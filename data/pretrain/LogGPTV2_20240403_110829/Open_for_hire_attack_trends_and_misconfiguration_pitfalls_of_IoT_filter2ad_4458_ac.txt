these networking events assists us in further understanding the
latest scanning and attack trends employed by adversaries. In addi-
tion to the data from the honeypots, we analyze the data from the
CAIDA UCSD Network-Telescope scanners dataset [14]. The UCSD
network telescope consists of a globally routed /8 network that
carries almost no legitimate traffic. The captured data provides us
with a snapshot of anomalous ’background’ traffic to 1/256th of all
public IPv4 destination addresses on the Internet. Unlike honeypots,
telescopes do not simulate any protocols and hence do not respond
to any requests. A significant part of the addresses are unused, and
any traffic on this network is potentially suspicious.
The traffic to CAIDA UCSD Network Telescope is captured and
offered in three forms; FlowTuple data, Raw pcap data, and Aggre-
gated Daily RSDoS Attack Metadata. The FlowTuple data is captured
hourly and consists of elementary information about the suspicious
traffic. The information includes source and destination IP address,
ports, timestamp, protocol, TTL, TCP flags, IP packet length, TCP-
SYN packet length, TCP-SYN window length, packet count, country
code, and ASN information [77]. Furthermore, additional metadata
like is_spoofed and is_masscan provide information if the source
IP address may be spoofed and if the Masscan tool [29] is used for
the scan. The files are stored on a minute basis, and hence there
are 1, 440 files generated per day. We use the FlowTuple data pro-
vided by CAIDA and parse the records for April 2021 and requests
targeting the Telnet, AMQP, MQTT, XMPP, CoAP, and UPnP pro-
tocols. Furthermore, we analyze and classify the suspicious sources
into scanning and malicious traffic based on the results we obtain
from our honeypot deployment and the ground truth from threat
intelligence repositories GreyNoise [30], and Virustotal [94].
4 RESULTS
This section presents our findings primarily on misconfigured de-
vices on the Internet and the attack trends observed through our
honeypots. The section is divided into the results obtained through
the Internet-wide scan, honeypot detection and the observations
from the deployed honeypots.
4.1 Results from Internet-wide scanning
4.1.1 Exposed devices. Upon scanning the Internet with ZMap
[24] for six protocols namely Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, XMPP, UPnP
and CoAP, we find a total of 14 million hosts with open ports. We
compare our scan results with the Project Sonar [67] Internet-wide
scan dataset and Shodan [73]. The total number of unique hosts
exposed to the Internet by the protocol identified through our scan
is listed in Table 4. The Project Sonar does not provide datasets for
AMQP and XMPP protocols.

Table 4: #Exposed systems on the Internet by protocol and
source
The number of hosts listed from Project Sonar and Shodan was
from the same period when our scans were performed. The to-
tal number of exposed hosts detected by our scan is higher than
the Project Sonar dataset and Shodan. We argue that this could
be because of possible allow-listing performed by these scanning
services. Another reason could be that our methodology involves
scanning the Internet for multiple ports for one protocol. For exam-
ple, we perform scans with both ports 23 and 2323 for the Telnet
protocol, while Project Sonar performs the scans only with port 23.
This leads to having a higher number of detected hosts.

4.1.2 Exposed Device Types. From Table 4, we observe that the
number of devices exposing Telnet (7M) is higher than the other
protocols. Telnet is highly targeted by botnets to infect with mal-
ware. From the banners and the responses received, we attempt to
detect the device type. The device types are identified by matching
specific text from the banners and the response. For example, the
HiKVision Network Camera responds with a banner "192.0.0.64
login:" for Telnet connections. The IP address is assigned to the
camera as a default configuration and hence responds with this
banner [34]. We discover many device types upon performing a
similar approach to find consistent banner and response patterns
across the scan results. We use the results obtained from the scan-
ning of the protocols to identify device types. We list the major
device types and the protocols on which they were detected in
Figure 2. We observe that most of the device types are identified
through the Telnet and the UPnP responses. The IoT devices were
identified with responses from the Telnet, UPnP, MQTT and CoAP
protocols. The response received from XMPP and AMQP services
were not sufficient to label the target as an IoT device. The basis on
which the device types are identified is listed in Appendix-Table

11 for every protocol. Furthermore, other device types like NAS,
micro 3D printers and so on are also listed. To facilitate automated
detection, we leverage ZTag [22], a tool for annotation of raw data
with additional metadata that facilitates tagging and automation of
the data from our scans. The banners and static responses are used
as metadata for tagging the device types.
the banners obtained through a Telnet session from the ZMap client.
Then, we systematically search the responses received from our
scanning process to filter the honeypot instances. Table 6 lists the
honeypots detected using the Telnet banners and the response
identified from honeypots 1. Overall, with this approach we were
able to detect a total of 8, 192 honeypots. The results are validated
on the basis of our previous work on honeypot fingerprinting [75].

Table 5: Total misconfigured devices per protocol
4.1.3 Misconfigured Devices. We consider the misconfigurations
for the protocols listed on Tables 2 and 3 for identifying the vul-
nerable devices. A misconfigured device is a device with no au-
thentication, no encryption, or no authorization configured. We
analyze the response received from the scans of all the protocols
and find a total of 1, 832, 893 misconfigured devices that satisfy at
least one of the conditions. The number of misconfigured devices
identified by the protocol are listed in Table 5. The table shows
the vulnerability identified in each of the protocols scanned and
analyzed by us. In TCP protocols, we see that there are devices
exposed with no authentication configured. This means that with a
simple connection request, the adversary could connect to the de-
vice. There is also a lack of authorization configured in devices that
allow the end systems to respond to queries from unknown hosts.
Furthermore, we detect many UDP-based devices that respond to
discovery queries and can be leveraged in denial of service attacks.
We further discuss this type of attack in Section 5. Table 10 in the
appendix lists the number of misconfigured devices distributed by
country on the six protocols. The source location of the attacks are
determined by using the ipgeolocation database [40]. We observe a
large number of countries including USA (27%), China (13%), Russia
(9.1%), Taiwan (8.9%), Germany (7.8%), Philippines(6.2%), UK(5.8%),
Brazil (3.3%), India (3.2%), Thailand (2.7%) , Hong Kong (2.7%), South
Korea (2.5%), Israel (2.1%), Canada (1.9%), Bangladesh (1.1%), France
(0.9%), Japan (0.7%), and other (1.3%).
4.2 Honeypot Detection
The misconfigured devices identified from our methodology could
contain honeypots that can lead to poisoned results. We use the
honeypot detection approach, described in Subsection 3.2, to filter
out the honeypots from our results. To fingerprint honeypots, we
initially perform a search for open-source and research-based IoT-
based honeypots. We deploy these honeypots in our lab and capture

4.3 Attack trends from honeypots and network
telescope
4.3.1 Honeypots. We deploy six honeypots as depicted in Figure
1 at our lab environment. The total number of attack events detected
by each honeypot by protocol over one month is listed in Table 7.
We observe a total of 200, 209 attack events from all the honeypots.
Even though any interaction with honeypots is considered an attack,
we argue that recurring scans from known sources (e.g. Shodan
[73]) can be considered benign traffic. The attack events consist of
both benign and malicious traffic. Scanning-service traffic involves
internet-wide scanning events from known sources like Shodan
[73], Censys [86], Project Sonar [67], BinaryEdge [38], ZoomEye
[62], Fofa [81] and educational organizations like RWTH Aachen
University [85]. Malicious traffic involves attacks from unknown
scanning sources or attacks with malicious payloads. The packets
include both scanning probes and malicious payloads.
Scanning service traffic. We perform a reverse lookup of the
source IP addresses of the suspicious traffic received on the hon-
eypots. We identify a total of 10, 696 unique IP addresses that are
registered to known scanning services shown in Figure 3. Table 7
lists the total unique IP addresses registered to scanning services,
detected per honeypot. Figure 3 shows the scanning-services re-
ceived on each honeypot. It lists the percentage of total scanning
traffic distributed between the identified services. The suspicious
traffic that does not resolve to the scanning-services is classified
as unknown and is not included as a scanning service. Further-
more, we observe that the IPs from the scanning services scan
the Internet periodically and thus are recurring, unlike suspicious
one-time scans. The prominent scanning services identified are

result of large number of suspicious static banners observed in the scan results.
