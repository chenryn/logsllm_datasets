### Networking Events and Data Analysis

Networking events provide valuable insights into the latest scanning and attack trends employed by adversaries. In addition to data from honeypots, we analyze data from the CAIDA UCSD Network-Telescope scanners dataset [14]. The UCSD network telescope consists of a globally routed /8 network that carries almost no legitimate traffic, offering a snapshot of anomalous 'background' traffic to 1/256th of all public IPv4 destination addresses on the Internet. Unlike honeypots, which simulate protocols and respond to requests, telescopes do not simulate any protocols and thus do not respond to any requests. A significant portion of the addresses in the telescope are unused, making any traffic on this network potentially suspicious.

The traffic to the CAIDA UCSD Network Telescope is captured and provided in three forms: FlowTuple data, Raw pcap data, and Aggregated Daily RSDoS Attack Metadata. FlowTuple data, captured hourly, includes basic information about suspicious traffic, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, timestamps, protocol, TTL, TCP flags, IP packet length, TCP-SYN packet length, TCP-SYN window length, packet count, country code, and ASN information [77]. Additional metadata, such as `is_spoofed` and `is_masscan`, indicate whether the source IP address may be spoofed and if the Masscan tool [29] is used for the scan. These files are stored on a minute basis, resulting in 1,440 files generated per day. We use the FlowTuple data provided by CAIDA and parse the records for April 2021, focusing on requests targeting the Telnet, AMQP, MQTT, XMPP, CoAP, and UPnP protocols. We then classify the suspicious sources into scanning and malicious traffic based on our honeypot deployment and ground truth from threat intelligence repositories like GreyNoise [30] and VirusTotal [94].

### Results

This section presents our findings on misconfigured devices on the Internet and the attack trends observed through our honeypots. The results are divided into those obtained through an Internet-wide scan, honeypot detection, and observations from the deployed honeypots.

#### 4.1 Results from Internet-wide Scanning

##### 4.1.1 Exposed Devices

Using ZMap [24], we scanned the Internet for six protocols: Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, XMPP, UPnP, and CoAP. We found a total of 14 million hosts with open ports. We compared our scan results with the Project Sonar [67] Internet-wide scan dataset and Shodan [73]. Table 4 lists the total number of unique hosts exposed to the Internet by each protocol identified through our scan. The Project Sonar does not provide datasets for AMQP and XMPP protocols.

| Protocol | ZMap Scan | Project Sonar | Shodan |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| AMQP     | 34,542    | NA            | 18,701 |
| XMPP     | 423,867   | NA            | 315,861 |
| CoAP     | 618,650   | 438,098       | 590,740 |
| UPnP     | 1,381,940 | 395,331       | 433,571 |
| MQTT     | 4,842,465 | 3,921,585     | 162,216 |
| Telnet   | 7,096,465 | 6,004,956     | 188,291 |
| **Total** | **14,397,929 (14M)** | **10,759,970 (10M)** | **1,709,380 (1M)** |

The number of hosts listed from Project Sonar and Shodan was from the same period when our scans were performed. Our scan detected a higher number of exposed hosts than both Project Sonar and Shodan. This could be due to possible allow-listing performed by these scanning services or our methodology, which involves scanning multiple ports for one protocol. For example, we scan both ports 23 and 2323 for the Telnet protocol, while Project Sonar only scans port 23.

##### 4.1.2 Exposed Device Types

From Table 4, we observe that the number of devices exposing Telnet (7M) is higher than other protocols. Telnet is highly targeted by botnets for malware infection. By analyzing banners and responses, we attempt to detect device types. For instance, HiKVision Network Cameras respond with a banner "192.0.0.64 login:" for Telnet connections. Using this approach, we identify various device types and list them in Figure 2. Most device types are identified through Telnet and UPnP responses. IoT devices are identified through responses from Telnet, UPnP, MQTT, and CoAP protocols. Responses from XMPP and AMQP services were insufficient to label targets as IoT devices. The basis for identifying device types is listed in Appendix-Table 200. To facilitate automated detection, we use ZTag [22] to annotate raw data with additional metadata for tagging and automation.

##### 4.1.3 Misconfigured Devices

We consider misconfigurations for the protocols listed in Tables 2 and 3 to identify vulnerable devices. A misconfigured device has no authentication, no encryption, or no authorization. Analyzing the responses from the scans, we find a total of 1,832,893 misconfigured devices. Table 5 lists the number of misconfigured devices per protocol and the vulnerabilities identified.

| Protocol | Vulnerability | #Devices Found |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| CoAP     | No auth, admin access | 427 |
| AMQP     | No auth | 2,731 |
| Telnet   | No auth | 4,013 |
| XMPP     | No encryption | 5,421 |
| CoAP     | No auth | 9,067 |
| Telnet   | No auth, root access | 22,887 |
| MQTT     | No auth | 102,891 |
| XMPP     | Anonymous login | 143,986 |
| CoAP     | Reflection-attack resource | 543,341 |
| UPnP     | Reflection-attack resource | 998,129 |
| **Total** | **1,832,893** | |

In TCP protocols, we see devices exposed with no authentication, allowing adversaries to connect with a simple request. There is also a lack of authorization, allowing end systems to respond to queries from unknown hosts. UDP-based devices responding to discovery queries can be leveraged in denial-of-service attacks, discussed further in Section 5. Table 10 in the appendix lists the distribution of misconfigured devices by country, determined using the ipgeolocation database [40].

#### 4.2 Honeypot Detection

Misconfigured devices identified in our methodology may include honeypots, which can lead to biased results. We use a honeypot detection approach, described in Subsection 3.2, to filter out honeypots. We search for open-source and research-based IoT honeypots, deploy them in our lab, and capture their banners and static responses. Table 6 lists the honeypots detected using Telnet banners and responses, totaling 8,192 instances.

#### 4.3 Attack Trends from Honeypots and Network Telescope

##### 4.3.1 Honeypots

We deployed six honeypots in our lab environment, as depicted in Figure 1. Table 7 lists the total number of attack events detected by each honeypot by protocol over one month. We observed a total of 200,209 attack events. Although any interaction with honeypots is considered an attack, recurring scans from known sources (e.g., Shodan [73]) can be considered benign traffic. The attack events consist of both benign and malicious traffic, including internet-wide scanning events from known sources and attacks from unknown scanning sources or with malicious payloads.

| Honeypot | Simulated Device Profile | Protocols |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| HosTaGe  | Arduino Board with IoT Protocols | Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, CoAP, SSH, HTTP, SMB, UPnP |
| U-Pot    | Belkin Wemo smart switch | Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, CoAP, SSH, HTTP, SMB, UPnP |
| Conpot   | Siemens S7 PLC | Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, CoAP, SSH, HTTP, SMB, UPnP |
| ThingPot | Cowrie | Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, CoAP, SSH, HTTP, SMB, UPnP |
| Dionaea  | Arduino IoT device with frontend | Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, CoAP, SSH, HTTP, SMB, UPnP |
| SSH Server with IoT banner | SSH, Telnet, HTTP, MQTT, FTP, SMB | Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, CoAP, SSH, HTTP, SMB, UPnP |

**Scanning Service Traffic**

We performed a reverse lookup of the source IP addresses of the suspicious traffic received on the honeypots, identifying 10,696 unique IP addresses registered to known scanning services, as shown in Figure 3. Table 7 lists the total unique IP addresses registered to scanning services, detected per honeypot. The prominent scanning services identified are Stretchoid.com [78], Censys, Shodan, Bitsight [12], BinaryEdge [38], Project Sonar [67], Shadow Server [70], Interne TTL [39], Alpha, and others. IPs from these services scan the Internet periodically, unlike suspicious one-time scans.
