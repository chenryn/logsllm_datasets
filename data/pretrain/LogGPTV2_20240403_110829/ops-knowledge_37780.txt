Similar to a tiling server for spatial image data, I need to display many on-the-fly generated images in my Django-based web application. These images may require merging, color correction, and other transformations. Since a single client can easily request over 100 images in a short period, this can easily overwhelm the web server (Apache + mod_wsgi).

To address this issue, I am exploring alternative approaches. Given that we already use Celery, it seems logical to offload the image processing to Celery and push the generated images to the client asynchronously. To facilitate this, I have switched the WSGI server to gevent, with Apache serving as a reverse proxy. However, I have not yet managed to implement the push mechanism, and I am uncertain if this is the right direction.

Based on this, I have three specific questions:

1. **Is using Celery, gentry, and Socket.IO a sensible approach to handle many clients without overwhelming the web server? Are there any alternative solutions you would recommend?**
2. **If I delegate the image processing to Celery and let it push the image data to the browser when complete, will the connection bypass Apache?**
3. **If a push mechanism is used, is it better to maintain a single connection or establish a new connection for each image (and close it when done)?**

### Background

The Django application I am working on allows users to view very large images. This is achieved by tiling the large images and displaying only the relevant tiles in a grid. This tiling method is standard in the field of mapping and spatial image data (e.g., OpenStreetMap). Unlike typical mapping data, our application also supports multiple Z-slices, allowing users to scroll through biological images.

This works well when the tiles are statically served. However, I recently added the option to generate tiles on the fly, which involves merging different images and applying color corrections. While this functionality works, it places a significant load on the web server, as each image takes about 0.1 seconds to generate. We currently use Apache with mod_wsgi (WSGIRestrictedEmbedded On), and it is easy to bring the server down. Simply browsing through the image stack can cause the web server to hang. I have tried adjusting `MaxClients`, turning off `KeepAlive`, and experimenting with different thread/process combinations for mod_wsgi, but these changes have not been sufficient to support more than one user.

Given these challenges, I am considering a Comet/WebSocket approach to improve performance.

### Additional Considerations

If a single user is enough to bring down the web server, the issue likely lies in the efficiency of the tiling routines and the amount of data being delivered. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Optimize Tiling Routines:** Ensure that the tiling process is as efficient as possible and that only the data the user actually sees is delivered.
2. **Hardware Upgrades:** Consider upgrading to a faster CPU, more RAM, and an SSD to improve overall performance.
3. **Aggressive Caching:** Implement caching strategies to reduce the number of on-the-fly image generations.
4. **Alternative Web Servers:** While switching to a different web server might provide some performance benefits, it is unlikely to be a silver bullet. Focus on optimizing the existing setup first.
