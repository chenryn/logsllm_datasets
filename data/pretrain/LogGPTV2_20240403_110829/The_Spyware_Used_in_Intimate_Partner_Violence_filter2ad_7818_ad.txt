### Anti-theft and Surveillance Applications

Anti-theft applications, designed to recover stolen phones, offer functionalities that extend beyond mere location tracking. For instance, Wheres My Droid can take photos, record ambient audio, and remotely wipe or lock the device in stealth mode. It also sends notifications if the SIM card is changed, provides full call and SMS logs, and shares the GPS location when the battery is low. Cerberus, another anti-theft app, includes all these features and adds a remote Android shell through its web portal, allowing for almost any action that can be performed on the phone to be executed remotely. Cerberus is frequently recommended for intimate partner surveillance (IPS) in blogs and forums. Similarly, survivors and professionals working with them have reported using anti-theft apps in IPS contexts [23, 29, 53].

### Data Synchronization Applications

Basic data synchronization applications allow users to sync information across devices. A common example is Mysms, which forwards SMS messages. In an IPS context, this can enable an abuser to monitor text messages. Other file synchronization apps automatically copy configurable folders to a cloud location. While these may seem harmless, at least one IPS-related forum suggests using such an app in conjunction with a call recording app to eavesdrop on a victim’s communications.

### Couple Tracking Applications

Couple tracking applications are designed for mutual location and data sharing. For example, Couple Tracker, which must be set up on both partners' phones, automatically shares location history, call logs, the first 30 characters of every sent and received SMS, and even Facebook activity (if provided with the credentials).

### Phone Control and Child Monitoring Applications

Phone control and child monitoring applications often provide extensive capabilities. These apps allow access to location, SMS content, call logs (sometimes including recordings), media, app usage, internet activity, and even keylogging. Some apps can be configured to send notifications when the monitored phone leaves a geofence or calls a specific number. Notably, all off-store spyware apps analyzed describe child safety as a use case. An off-store app called TeenSafe, which checks the age of the Google account, makes it difficult to use for IPS, leading to complaints from abusers in reviews.

### Covert Operations

In an IPS context, it is advantageous for an abuser if the tools operate covertly, meaning they can function without the victim's knowledge and remain undetected. Here, we examine how challenging it would be for a victim, assumed to be of average technical sophistication, to notice the IPS app. Section VI discusses software tools for detecting spyware.

The Google Play developer policy requires apps to present users with a persistent notification and a unique icon whenever they collect sensitive information. However, some notiﬁcations, like the GPS usage icon, do not specify which app is using the service and are always visible for many Android users. Other notifications, such as those for camera or microphone use, are not OS-enforced and can be hidden by default.

Even when notifications are present, victims are unlikely to observe or interpret them correctly. Prior research has shown that users often overlook security indicators, such as the TLS lock in browsers [13, 52]. Many off-store and some on-store apps can be configured to hide their icons. For example, iKeyMonitor allows icon hiding and can be accessed later by dialing #8888 (an abuser can set the secret). TrackView, an on-store app, leaves no access point on the device once the icon is hidden but can be controlled from the abuser’s phone. Cerberus is another on-store app that hides its icon.

### Remote Control Capabilities

Some spyware apps allow remote control of the device. Child safety apps can block specific apps, impose browser restrictions, or limit phone usage. Anti-theft apps can remotely lock or wipe the phone. Phone control apps allow the abuser to change settings, such as enabling GPS or WiFi. These commands are typically sent through a web portal or via SMS with a keyword that triggers a response from the app.

### Bundled Dual-Use Applications

An important class of dual-use apps are those bundled with the operating system by manufacturers or cellular service providers. For example, Verizon Family Locator does not require an abuser to install an app and can be activated with the account credentials. Android natively provides tracking via Find My Device or Google Maps’ location sharing. If the abuser has the victim’s Google credentials, they can turn on the Google Maps Timeline feature and obtain periodic location information. Google Drive and iCloud also provide data syncing, which can be abused for extracting data.

Some bundled apps, like Find My Device, notify the user that the device is being tracked. Adding a member in Sprint Family Locator sends an activation SMS to the victim’s phone. Even in these cases, notifications can be ignored or suppressed if the attacker has temporary physical access.

These apps are often impossible to uninstall and can only be disabled. Mitigation strategies for these apps will differ from those for on-store or off-store apps, as discussed in Section VII.

### Evidence of Developer Complicity

In this section, we investigate the use of dual-use apps for IPS. Some app makers are aware of such abuse and actively support it through advertising, failing to refuse potential customers, or failing to assist victims.

#### User Comments

On Google Play, users can leave reviews. We collected 464,625 reviews from over 9,000 apps and found 103 reviews on 82 apps explicitly mentioning the use of the app for tracking or spying on a current or previous intimate partner. For example, a review for SMS Tracker Plus states: “Love it!!! I’ve been suspecting my gf cheating and this gave me answers really quick kick the curb girl.” Another review for ATTI Shadow Tracker says: “Love it! I can now keep an eye on my possibly cheating wife!” While we cannot verify the content, there is no reason to suspect dishonesty.

#### Advertising

Many IPS apps, including dual-use ones, advertise IPS use cases directly or indirectly. Google search advertisements show thousands of ads for terms like “how to catch a cheating spouse with his cell phone.” Ad texts often indicate that companies are advertising IPS. For example, an ad for mSpy reads: “Catch Cheater with mSpy App for Phones. Invisible Mode. Track SMS Chats Calls Location & Other. 1,000,000+ Satisfied Users. Try Now!” Another ad for FoneMonitor states: “Track My Wife’s Phone — Want to Spy on your Wife? Track your Wife without her knowing. Discover Who They Are Messaging. Download! 24-Hour Support Price Superiority No Jailbreaking and App Results Guaranteed.”

We informed Google about these search terms, and they expanded their restrictions on serving ads for such terms. The Play Store also expanded their restrictions after we shared our findings.

Blogs and forums often provide advice on conducting IPS. Some blogs hosted on dual-use app domains explicitly outline why their product is ideal for covert tracking, sometimes accompanied by imagery of a battered woman and language like “men need to have control of their families.” For example, catchthemtoday.com, a blog focused on IPS, links to mSpy.com. The mSpy webpage discusses child safety and employee monitoring, but the redirect ensures the disclaimer is never seen.

#### Direct Marketing

During our analysis, we created dummy accounts and received marketing emails encouraging us to sign up for services. Two companies offered to sell smartphones preloaded with their software. While these emails do not explicitly suggest giving the devices to an intimate partner, the same companies advertise these use cases elsewhere.

#### Customer Support

To investigate company attitudes towards IPS, we contacted customer support teams, posing as both an abuser and a survivor. Only 11 out of 12 apps offered a way to contact them. All conversations were initiated from a Gmail account associated with the name Jessica, starting with: “Hi, If I use this app to track my husband will he know that I am tracking him? Thanks, Jessie.”

Of the 11 companies, 2 did not respond. Of the 9 that responded, one, TeenSafe, delivered a strong admonishment and legal warning. The other 8 responded with some version of “No, he shouldn’t be able to tell,” making them complicit in potential abuse. TrackView, available on the Play Store, told us that with the paid plan, the icon and all notifications could be hidden. They also responded to inquiries from a survivor, advising to “look in the app menu and delete it,” which was not useful since the app icon was concealed.

### Inefficacy of Existing Anti-Spyware Tools

The previous sections highlight the prevalence, ease-of-use, and severity of overt spyware and dual-use apps. Many of these tools are inherently or can be configured to be difficult to detect. Current best practice for potential victims is to suspect spyware if there are spikes in bandwidth usage, decreased battery life, slow responsiveness, or if the abuser knows information that can only be learned from spyware. Typically, the only recourse for strong suspicions is a factory reset or discarding the phone. Ideally, there should be technical means for detecting and mitigating spyware.

Several tools claim to detect and remove spyware, ranging from well-known commercial anti-virus systems like Avast, Norton, and ESET to barely functional apps that appear to be scams. In this section, we test these countermeasures to see if they should be used by potential victims.

#### Anti-Spyware Tools on Google Play

There are many apps in the Google Play store that claim to be anti-spyware tools. To identify these apps, we followed a similar procedure to discovering spyware, but from a potential victim’s perspective. We started with terms like “anti spyware,” “remove phone tracker,” and “spyware removal tool,” and conducted snowball querying using the Google Play query completion API. This resulted in 147 apps with more than 50,000 installations. Manual inspection revealed 40 relevant apps for removing spyware, with 7 from major antivirus vendors: Avast, AVG, Avira, ESET, Kaspersky, McAfee, and Norton. The remaining 33 apps are from other vendors, some with over 100 million downloads.

Interestingly, many anti-virus apps provide find-my-phone, anti-theft, or family safety functionality, making them potentially dual-use. None are covert, but they could hypothetically be used by abusers. Nevertheless, we do not consider them as such because their primary functionality is not for spying, and they are not returned in response to abuser search queries.

#### Experimental Setup

To evaluate the efficacy of anti-spyware apps in detecting dual-use apps, we installed 276 dual-use apps out of 280 identified via manual inspection on a device running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow). Four could not be installed due to compatibility issues. We also installed 20 out of 23 off-store spyware apps.

### Conclusion

The widespread availability and ease of use of dual-use and spyware apps pose significant risks in intimate partner surveillance. Developers and platforms must take responsibility to prevent the misuse of these tools. Additionally, effective anti-spyware solutions are needed to protect potential victims.
