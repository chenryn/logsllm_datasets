Anti-theft apps, built
to recover stolen phones, provide
functionality beyond location tracking. For example, Wheres
My Droid can take photos, record ambient audio, and wipe or
lock the device remotely in stealth mode. It sends a notiﬁcation
if the SIM card is changed, sends full call and SMS logs,
and sends GPS location of the phone if it is low on battery.
Cerberus, another app built for anti-theft, provides all that
functionality, along with a remote Android shell in its web
portal. This means almost anything that can be done while
using the phone can be done remotely. As previously dis-
cussed, Cerberus is recommended for IPS in blogs and forums.
Similarly, survivors and professionals working with them have
indicated that anti-theft apps are used in IPS [23, 29, 53].
Basic data syncing apps synchronize information across
devices. A common personal use example is SMS forwarding
with apps such as Mysms, which in an IPS context allows
an abuser to monitor text messages. There are other ﬁle
synchronization apps that will automatically copy one or
more conﬁgurable folders (set during installation) to a cloud
location. While these may seem benign, at least one IPS-
related forum we found suggests using such an app in con-
junction with a call recording app (that automatically records
all incoming and outgoing calls) to listen in on a victim’s
communications.
Couple tracking apps are designed for mutual tracking, and
tend to provide both location and data syncing. For example,
Couple Tracker, which must be conﬁgured on a pair of phones,
automatically shares with the other party location history, call
logs, the ﬁrst 30 characters of every sent and received SMS,
and even Facebook activity (if provided with the credentials).
Phone control and child monitoring apps often provide some
of the richest capabilities. Phone control apps are built for a
user to remotely control their own phone for convenience,
while parental control apps are meant for parents to keep
an eye on their child’s phone activity. Both types of apps
provide access to location, SMS contents, call logs (sometimes
recordings), all media contents, app usage, Internet activity
logs, and even keylogging. Some apps can be conﬁgured
to send notiﬁcations when the monitored phone engages in
certain activities,
like leaving a set geofence or calling a
speciﬁc number. We note that all of the off-store spyware
apps that we analyzed describe child safety as one of their
use cases. An off-store app called TeenSafe (not found in our
abuser-oriented searches), makes it difﬁcult to use for IPS by
checking the age of the Google account to which the device
is registered. Abusers complain in reviews of TeenSafe about
the difﬁculty in using it for IPS.
Covertness. In an IPS context, it’s beneﬁcial to an abuser if
tools are covert, meaning they can operate without the victim’s
knowledge, and can potentially remain undiscovered even if
the victim looks through all the apps in their app menu. Here
we examine how difﬁcult it would be for a victim, assumed to
be of average technical sophistication, to notice the IPS app.
In Section VI we discuss software tools for detecting spyware.
The Google Play developer policy obligates apps to “Present
users with a persistent notiﬁcation and unique icon that clearly
identiﬁes the app” [1] whenever the app is collecting sensitive
information. Certain notiﬁcations are enforced by the operating
system, such as the GPS usage notiﬁcation icon that appears
in the dock at the top of the screen whenever an app is using
location service. This icon does not specify which app is
using GPS, and is ever-present for many Android users. Other
notiﬁcations are not OS-required, for example we encountered
apps that by default do not display any notiﬁcation when using
the camera or microphone.
Even when notiﬁcations are present, we suspect victims are
unlikely to observe them, let alone properly interpret their
meaning. Prior work has shown how poorly users respond
to other types of security indicators (e.g., the TLS lock in
browsers [13, 52]).
Almost all off-store apps and even some on-store apps
can be conﬁgured to hide their icons. (The OS does not
enforce that an icon be displayed.) One off-store example
is iKeyMonitor, which allows icon hiding, and can be later
accessed by dialing #8888(cid:2) (an abuser can set the secret).
An on-store app called TrackView leaves no access point on
the device once the icon is hidden, but allows all of the app’s
settings to be changed from an app on the abuser’s phone.
Cerberus is another on-store app that hides its icon.
Control. Some spyware apps allow an abuser to remotely
control the device. Child safety apps can be conﬁgured to
block speciﬁc apps, impose browser restrictions, or limit the
number of hours the phone can be used in a day. Anti-theft
apps allow remotely locking the phone or wiping all data from
the phone. Some apps, broadly classiﬁed as phone control
apps, allow the abuser to remotely change the phone’s settings,
such as (re-)enabling GPS or WiFi.
Apps that allow such control of a device rely on commands
being sent either through the customer’s web portal (and
thereby the company’s server, which then relays the command
to the device) or by sending an SMS to the phone containing
a keyword that triggers a response from the app (the spyware
passively observes all incoming SMS). Most of these apps
allow the customer to customize their SMS keywords and may
even hide the SMS from view in the UI.
C. Bundled dual-use apps
An important class of dual-use apps that fall outside the
dichotomy of on- or off-store apps are the tools packaged
with the OS, either by a cellphone manufacturer or a cellular
service provider. One example of the latter is the Verizon
Family Locator. These do not require an abuser to install an
app on the phone, and often can be remotely activated with
the credentials attached to the account that pays the cellular
bill. Android natively provides tracking functionality, via Find
My Device, or via Google Maps’ unlimited location sharing
functionality. Assuming the abuser has access to the victim’s
Google credentials, the abuser can remotely turn on the Google

Maps Timeline feature and obtain periodic (even historical)
information about the victim’s location. Google Drive and
iCloud provide data syncing functionality to the cloud, and
could be abused for extracting data from the device.
Some bundled apps that we investigated show notiﬁcations
to the current user of the device. For example, Find My
Device sends a notiﬁcation stating that your device is being
tracked. Adding a member (in an abuse context, the victim)
in the Sprint Family Locator will send an activation SMS
to the victim’s phone. Even in these cases, as mentioned,
notiﬁcations can be ignored or suppressed should the attacker
have temporary physical access to the device.
These apps can be impossible to uninstall as they are bun-
dled with the OS; at best they can be disabled. Looking ahead
to mitigation, these apps will require different approaches than
that used for on-store or off-store apps. See the discussion in
Section VII.
V. EVIDENCE OF DEVELOPERS’ COMPLICITY
In this section, we investigate the use of dual-use apps for
IPS. The makers of some of these apps are not only aware
of such abuse but are actively supporting the IPS use case
via advertisement, by failing to refuse a potential customer
that wants to use their software illegally, or failing to help an
ostensible IPS victim being monitored by their software.
A. User Comments
On Google Play users can leave reviews of apps they have
downloaded. We collected 464,625 reviews from over 9,000
apps. We searched for reviews mentioning both an intimate
partner (husband, wife, boyfriend, bf, gf) and an IPS action
word (track, spy, cheat, catch), and manually analyzed the
results. We found 103 reviews on 82 apps that explicitly
mention that the app is used for tracking or spying on a current
or previous intimate partner. For example, a comment left for
SMS Tracker Plus, an app which claims to be for parental
control, states: “Love it!!! I’ve been suspecting my gf cheating
and this gave me answers really quick kick the curb girl”. Another
comment on ATTI Shadow Tracker, an app which markets
itself for tracking a ﬂeet of long-haul truckers, states: “Love it!
I can now keep an eye on my possibly cheating wife!”. While we
cannot verify the content of these reviews, we have no reason
to suspect that they are dishonest.
B. Advertising
We found that many IPS apps, including dual-use ones,
advertise IPS use cases directly or indirectly.
Google search advertisements. We searched Google with a
subset of 1,400 queries from the 10,000 terms we found in
Section III-A and recorded the ads shown on the ﬁrst page
of the search results. We found thousands of ads shown for
search terms that show explicit intention of IPS, e.g., “how
to catch a cheating spouse with his cell phone”. A detailed
analysis of advertisements shown on Google searches is given
in Appendix D.
The ad texts often indicates that companies are advertising
IPS as a use case. An ad recorded on March 10th 2017 for
mSpy says “Catch Cheater with mSpy App for Phones. Invisible
Mode. Track SMS Chats Calls Location & Other. 1.000.000+ Satisﬁed
Users. Try Now!” Another ad recorded the same day for
FoneMonitor reads “Track My Wife’s Phone — Want to Spy on
your Wife? Track your Wife without her knowing. Discover Who Are
They messaging. Download! 24-Hour Support Price Superiority No
Jailbreaking and App Results Guaranteed.”
We informed Google about the IPS search terms that showed
ads during our experiment. In response, Google expanded their
restriction of ad serving on those types of search terms. We
conﬁrmed that ads are not being shown on explicit IPS search
terms at the time of the ﬁnal version of the paper.
Play Store. The Google Play website does not serve adver-
tisements, but the Play Store app does. We chose some of the
malicious terms from the snowball set and did manual searches
in the Play Store app on an Android device. We found that
apps on Play Store were also advertising on search terms like
“phone spy on husband” or “see who bf is texting without
him knowing.” While a more systematic study is needed, it is
clear that apps are being (and are allowed to be) advertised for
IPS-related searches. After we shared the result of our study,
Play Store has also expanded their restriction of ad serving on
those types of search terms.
Blogs as IPS advertising. As mentioned in Section III-A, we
found that Google searches such as “how can I read my wife’s
texts” yielded many blogs and forums providing advice. Some
of these “blogs” were hosted on the domain of a dual-use app
and explicitly outline why their product is ideal for covert
tracking, sometimes accompanied by imagery of a battered
woman and verbiage such as “men need to have control of their
families”. An egregious example appears in Figure 1. These
pages then link back to the site of the app, which is hosted at
the same domain but in some cases have a completely different
page format.
In addition to such advertising sites that appear on the same
domain as an app’s, we identiﬁed many ostensibly unafﬁliated
websites, blogs, and forums that serve the sole purpose of
directing those interested in conducting IPS to a speciﬁc dual-
use app. As one example, catchthemtoday.com, a blog focused
on IPS has content such as “Don’t Be A Sucker Track Your
Girlfriend’s iPhone Now: Get It Here: Catch Her Today”. The last
three words are a Bitly link to appitunes.blogspot.com, which
automatically redirects to mSpy.com. The blogspot.com page
claims to have been last updated in October, 2017. It includes
text that mSpy was created for child safety and employee
monitoring uses, and that “mSpy is not liable for other ways
of the software use”. (The redirect, however, ensures that this
disclaimer is never seen.) The mSpy webpage, though, only
discusses the child safety and employee monitoring use cases.
Direct marketing. During our manual analysis of apps
in Section IV, we created accounts with, but had not yet
purchased subscriptions for, several of the companies whose
450

customer service departments we later engaged (see below).
We found that our dummy account received marketing emails
encouraging us to sign up for their services once our free
trials had expired. Two companies encouraged us to buy a
smartphone from them which would come prepackaged with
their software (for streamlined abuser experience). We saw
comparable advertisements for iOS. While these emails don’t
explicitly suggest giving these devices to an intimate partner,
these same companies do advertise those use cases elsewhere.
C. Customer Support
Though some companies actively advertise IPS as a use
case, we suspected that many more turn a blind eye to it. To
investigate this, we contacted customer service departments
posing both as an abuser and a survivor to see how they
responded. Our IRB conﬁrmed that this is exempted from
review, as the interaction is in their professional capacities
and does not collect any PII. We selected a subset of 12 apps,
5 off-store and 7 on-store. We chose a set of apps that had
shown advertisements on IPS-related terms, or that we knew
to be widely used, either by install counts for on-store apps
or by blog and forum mentions for off-store apps.
To investigate the attitude of a company towards the use
of their software for IPS, we initiated live chats or email
conversations with their customer support teams, posing as
a potential abuser. Only 11 of the 12 apps offered any way to
contact them.
All conversations were initiated from a Gmail account
associated with the name Jessica and began with the following
prompt:
Hi, If I use this app to track my husband will he know
that I am tracking him? Thanks, Jessie
If customer service responded to this prompt with a question,
such as “What kind of phone does he have?” we continued
the conversation in an attempt to elicit the company’s attitude
towards this use case.
Of the 11 companies we contacted, 2 have yet to respond.
Of the 9 that responded, one, TeenSafe, which is an off-store
app, delivered a strong admonishment and legal warning about
IPS. The other 8 responded with some version of “No, he
shouldn’t be able to tell”, making them complicit in potential
abuse. The customer support representative for TrackView,
which is available on Play Store and has an entire Google
Groups Forum for customer support, told us that with the paid
plan, the icon and all notiﬁcations could be hidden. We have
conﬁrmed that this is true. TrackView is also the only company
that has responded to our inquiries posing as a survivor looking
for help removing their app. Their response showed no sign of
concern, and their advice of “look in the app menu and delete
it” was not useful, given that the app icon was concealed.
VI. INEFFICACY OF EXISTING ANTI-SPYWARE
The previous sections reveal the prevalence, ease-of-use,
and severity of overt spyware and dual-use apps. Moreover,
many of the tools are inherently, or can be conﬁgured to be,
difﬁcult to detect by inspection of the device via the normal
UI. What can potential victims of spyware do? Current best
practice is circumstantial [30], with victims advised to suspect
spyware should there be spikes in bandwidth usage, decreased
battery life, slow responsiveness, or information the abuser
knows that is seemingly only possible to learn from spyware.
Typically, the only recourse for strong suspicions are factory
resetting or completely discarding the phone. Obviously it
would be better to have technical means for detecting and
mitigating spyware.
A number of tools do advertise the ability to detect and
remove spyware, perhaps suggesting defenses against spyware
are close at hand. These anti-spyware tools range from mobile
versions of well-known, commercial anti-virus systems such
as Avast, Norton, and ESET, down to barely functional apps
that appear to be scams. In this section we put these counter-
measures to the test to see whether they should be used by
potential victims.
A. Anti-Spyware Tools on Google Play
There are many apps in the Google Play store that claim to
be anti-spyware tools. To identify these apps we followed a
similar procedure to that used for discovering spyware, but this
time performing searches from a potential spyware victim’s
perspective. We began our query snowball with the terms
“anti spyware”, “remove phone tracker”, and “spyware re-
moval tool”, and conducted snowball querying using the query
completion API provided by Google Play (see Section III-B).
The eventual snowball size was 13, and upon search with
those terms, returned 147 apps that have more than 50,000
installations as reported by Google Play. Manual inspection of
the 147 apps revealed 40 to be relevant for removing spyware.
All of them advertise a free scanning facility, but some charge
money to remove apps.
Among these 40 apps 7 were from major antivirus vendors:
Avast, AVG, Avira, ESET, Kaspersky, McAfee, and Norton.
The remaining 33 apps are from other vendors, though note
that some of these have more than 100 million downloads.
In Figure 6 we show the 19 anti-spyware apps that were
downloaded at least 10 million times or came up in the top 10
results for searching “anti spyware” in Play Store, as recorded
in November 2017.
Interestingly many anti-virus apps provide ﬁnd-my-phone,
anti-theft, or family safety functionality, making these poten-
tially dual-use. None are covert, but even so these anti-spyware
tools could hypothetically be used by abusers as dual-use apps.
Nevertheless we do not consider them as such, because their
primary functionality is not for spying (see Section II). More
pragmatically, they are not returned in response to abuser
search queries and we found no evidence online or in prior
work of their abuse in IPS settings.
Experimental setup. To evaluate the efﬁcacy of the anti-
spyware apps in detecting dual-use apps, we installed 276
dual-use apps out of 280 identiﬁed via manual inspection as
described in Section III-B on a device running Android 6.0
(Marshmallow). Four could not be installed due to compatibil-
ity issues. We also installed 20 out of the 23 off-store spyware
