Worm Scans per Second (log)
(f) PGD
Fig. 2. F- against random worm: percent of experiments where the worm was
not detected (lower is better performance) with a random scanning worm infecting
randomly selected hosts. For each environment and scanning rate we conducted 16
individual experiments using diﬀerent ﬁrst infected hosts and diﬀerent random seeds.
In each case the experiment was run until the worm was detected or one hour elapsed
without detection.
