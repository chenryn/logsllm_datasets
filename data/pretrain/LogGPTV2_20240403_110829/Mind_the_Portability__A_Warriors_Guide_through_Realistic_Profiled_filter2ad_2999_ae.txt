before directly using the built templates. In 2018, the CHES
conference announced a side-channel CTF event for “Deep
learning vs. classic proﬁling”, which also considers the case
of portability. One of the contest categories was protected AES
implementation. The winning attack was a combination of a
linear classiﬁer (decision tree and perceptron) and SAT solver.
The attack needed ﬁve traces and 44 hours of SAT solver
time to achieve 100% success for different devices, but only
one trace was enough for attacking the same device [41]. To
summarize, all previous works applied a target speciﬁc pre-
processing or post-processing to ﬁght portability.
Very recently, two studies have been reported with a focus
on portability. A cross-device side-channel attack was pre-
13
sented in [42], where the authors aim to propose a neural
network architecture optimized for the cross-device attack,
and in the process, highlight
the problem of portability.
Recently, Carbone et al. used deep learning to attack an
RSA implementation on an EAL4+ certiﬁed target [43]. In
both the works, the authors used several devices for various
stages of a proﬁled attack (i.e., training/validation/attack). The
classiﬁcation algorithm (MLP/CNN in their case) was trained
with traces from two devices and tested on a third device.
Interestingly, their observations agree with our results that
deep learning can help overcome portability when trained with
multiple devices. However, their focus lies in demonstrating
the feasibility of the attack in the presence of portability. In
contrast, we study the core problem of portability, identify
the limitations of state-of-the-art techniques through extensive
practical experiments, and propose a methodology based on
MDM. We believe that this work will pave the way for realistic
studies on SCA.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we tackle the portability issue in machine
learning-based side-channel attacks. We show how even small
differences between devices can cause attacks to perform
signiﬁcantly differently. As expected, our results clearly show
that the scenario where we use different keys and devices in
the proﬁling and attacking phase is the most difﬁcult one.
This is important because it means that most of the attacks
conducted in related works greatly overestimate their power as
they use the same device and key for both training and attack.
We identify the validation procedure as one of the pitfalls for
portability and machine learning. Consequently, we propose
Multiple Device Model to report > 10× improvement in attack
performance.
In our experiments, we considered homogeneous platforms
with no countermeasures. The choice was motivated by ﬁnding
the best case measurements to focus on portability problems.
In future work, we plan to extend this approach to hetero-
geneous platforms. It would also be interesting to investigate
what is the inﬂuence of various countermeasures (both hiding
and masking) to the performance of machine learning clas-
siﬁers when considering portability. Additionally, we plan to
experiment with a larger number of devices to improve the
generalization capabilities of machine learning algorithms.
Moreover, it is not always possible to assume the availability
of multiple devices to perform training under the Multiple
Device Model. In such settings, the adversary would need to
resort to simulation. Ideally, it is straightforward to simulate
multiple devices (or components) by running Monte Carlo
simulations with available process variation models, which
is widely popular in VLSI design. This simulation method-
ology can simply be extended to the board level, which is a
combination of several distinct devices with individual process
variation models. Note that the viability and accuracy of this
simulation methodology entirely depend on the availability and
precision of the process variation model, which are proprietary
to the manufacturer and might not be easily available. Practical
14
evaluation of the robustness of MDM with this simulation
methodology will be an interesting extension of this work.
Finally, our experiments indicate that smaller datasets could
be less prone to overﬁtting. It would be interesting to see
whether we can obtain good performance with small training
set sizes, which would conform to setting as described in [44].
