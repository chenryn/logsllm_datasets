## Proposal
Allow projects to specify list of recommended/required extensions.
### Proposed solution
For example, vscode may have in the `.vscode/settings.json`
    {
        "extensions.extendedConfigurations": {
             "chrome.debugger": {
                 "required": True
             }
        }
    }
When user will open this project - he will see a message if extension has not
been installed
> Current project recommend you to install chrome.debugger extension (tasks,
> debugger or syntax may depend on this extension). Do you want to install it?
