## Proposal
Enable projects to specify a list of recommended and required extensions.

### Proposed Solution
For instance, in a Visual Studio Code project, the `.vscode/settings.json` file could include:

```json
{
    "extensions.extendedConfigurations": {
        "chrome.debugger": {
            "required": true
        }
    }
}
```

When a user opens this project, if the specified extension is not installed, they will see the following message:

> This project recommends that you install the `chrome.debugger` extension. Some tasks, debugging features, or syntax highlighting may depend on it. Do you want to install it now?

This approach ensures that users are aware of the necessary tools for optimal project functionality, enhancing the development experience.
