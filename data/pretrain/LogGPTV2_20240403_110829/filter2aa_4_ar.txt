### Software Inventory and Control

Managing an inventory and control of software installed on your assets is a critical first step in enhancing your organization's security posture. This process should provide you with visibility into what software is installed, who installed it, and its function. Such information is essential for preventing unauthorized software from being installed on endpoints.

While some organizations view this as a complex, highly managed process, there are several efficient and automated methods to achieve this. Implementing these controls not only helps manage software but also improves other aspects of network access, asset configuration, and system management.

#### Controlling Installation Rights

Administrator access and installation rights should be restricted. In my experience, some organizations have granted administrative rights to all employees, including warehouse personnel and receptionists, allowing them to download any application without oversight. This practice can lead to the installation of seemingly innocent applications or games that may contain malware, adware, and other unwanted code.

#### Blacklisting and Whitelisting

Once installation rights are limited, the next step is to create a list of authorized and unauthorized applications, commonly known as whitelisting and blacklisting. Blacklisted software should never be allowed on the network, while whitelisted software is necessary for organizational operations. This can be implemented through an authorized software policy, followed by scanning, removal, and central inventory control.

#### Tools and Technologies

- **AppLocker**: Available natively in Windows 10 and Server, AppLocker allows you to control which apps and files users can run based on file attributes, user groups, and exceptions.
- **Group Policy-Based Whitelisting**: For supported versions of Windows, you can use Group Policy Objects (GPO) to enforce software restrictions. This can be managed locally using `secpol.msc` or through domain controllers.
- **Software Restriction Policies (SRP)**: These policies can be accessed via GPO and are useful for general-purpose workstations.
- **Endpoint Protection Suites**: Solutions like Carbon Black's Consolidated Endpoint Security offer centralized control over software installations and can integrate with antivirus and endpoint protection tools.

#### Software Inventory Management

- **SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager)**: SCCM is a robust tool for managing software inventories, especially if you already use it for hardware management. It involves deploying client agents on machines to communicate with SCCM servers, enabling the distribution of software packages and collecting inventory data.
- **Inventory Cycles**: After enabling software inventory, clients run a full inventory cycle, sending data to a management point, which then forwards it to the SCCM site server. Subsequent cycles report only updated information, ensuring you have the most current data.

### Continuous Vulnerability Management

Organizations today face a constant stream of new security information, including software updates, patches, and security advisories. Managing vulnerabilities is a continuous activity that requires significant time and attention.

#### Scanning and Remediation

- **Regular Scanning**: Depending on your organization's maturity, you may scan monthly or weekly. Some high-security organizations scan and patch nightly.
- **Vulnerability Databases**: Resources like the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), NVD (National Vulnerability Database), and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are invaluable for staying informed about the latest threats.

### Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges

Controlling who has administrative privileges is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. A common attack vector is through phishing campaigns where users with elevated credentials open malicious attachments.

#### Best Practices

- **Least Privilege**: Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Separate Accounts**: Create separate accounts for daily tasks and administrative tasks. Educate executives on the risks of having admin privileges.
- **Robust Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords and enforce multifactor authentication. Configure systems to issue alerts for failed login attempts.

### Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software

Newly imaged laptops and workstations often come with default configurations that are vulnerable. Here are steps to secure a Windows workstation:

1. **Enable System Protection and Create a Restore Point**:
   - Enable system protection and set a restore point to revert to a clean state if needed.
   - Adjust the maximum disk space used for system protection.

2. **Configure File Explorer Options**:
   - Show hidden files and folders, and unhide file extensions for better visibility.
   - Be cautious when un-hiding protected operating system files.

3. **Customize System Properties**:
   - Set default application settings and customize where documents are saved.

4. **Enable Encryption**:
   - Use tools like BitLocker to encrypt data, especially on laptops that may be lost or stolen.

5. **Enable Windows Defender and Browser Security Features**:
   - Turn on Windows Defender and configure Chrome to check for harmful software.

6. **Disable Advertising ID and Location Tracking**:
   - Disable interest-based advertising and location tracking to enhance privacy.

### Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs

Effective logging is essential for detecting and investigating security incidents. Logs should include events such as operating system activities, network changes, and application operations.

#### Key Log Events

- **Operating System Events**: Startup/shutdown, service changes, and security settings.
- **Logon Attempts**: Successful and unsuccessful logins, account changes, and use of privileged accounts.
- **Application Logs**: Authentication attempts, application failures, and major configuration changes.

#### Resources

- **Malware Archaeology**: A valuable resource for logging cheat sheets and best practices.
