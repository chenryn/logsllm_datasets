The EMP-A has the highest percentage of satisfaction time as 95% during the
sharing. However without sharing the percentage is only 69% in random usage
pattern and 63% in sinusoidal usage pattern. The other three algorithms have
similarperformanceofaround85%-88%duringthesharing,whichishigherthan
the case without sharing but not as good as the EMP-A.
5 Conclusion
With the trend of AIOps research fields in public cloud extending to resource
optimization, in this paper, we integrate the concept of Artificial Swarm Intel-
ligence and Personality Traits to design a multi-agent system on the resource
sharing of the cloud system. We have designed and implemented our main algo-
rithm,i.e.,EMP-A,aswellasthreeotheralgorithms,EMP-F,SEMPandNBSS
for comparison. All algorithms are capable to re-allocate spare resources to the
needyagentsthroughthesharingprocedurebetweentheagents,withoutadding
external resource.
To evaluate the performance of the 4 algorithms, we simulated a 100-agent
system, and executed 100 usage measuring rounds with two different use-case
scenarios. The results showed that EMP-A performance much better than the
other three algorithms (SEMP, EMP-F and NBSS) in terms of fewer sharing
steps as well as higher user satisfaction rate.

Abstract. Technology companies have become increasingly data-
driven, collecting and monitoring a growing list of metrics, such as
responsetime,throughput,pageviews,anduserengagement.Withhun-
dreds of metrics in a production environment, an automated approach
is needed to detect anomalies and alert potential incidents in real-time.
In this paper, we develop a time series anomaly detection framework
called Statistical Learning-Based Metric Anomaly Detection (SLMAD)
that allows for the detection of anomalies from key performance indica-
tors(KPIs)instreamingtimeseriesdata.Wedemonstratetheintegrated

1 Introduction
Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is an emerging field arising
in the intersection between the research areas of machine learning, big data,
and the management of IT operations [4]. The main aim is to analyze system
information of different kinds (metrics, logs, customer input, etc.) and support
administrators by optimizing various objectives like prevention of Service Level
Agreements(SLA)violation,earlyanomalydetection,auto-remediation,energy-
efficient system operation, providing optimal Quality of Experience (QoS) for
customers, predictive maintenance and many more [13,22]. Over the years, a
constantly growing interest can be observed in this field, which has led to the
development of practical tools from academia and industry.

With the large amount of data being collected, there is a need to identify
rare events and possible failures. Anomalies in time series data can potentially
resultinlossestothebusinessintermsofrevenueandmarketreputation.Accu-
rate anomaly detection can be used to trigger prompt troubleshooting and help
to avoid downtime or SLA violations for a company. Once the anomalies are
detected, alerts are either sent to the operators to make timely decisions related
totheincidentsorautomaticallyhandledbyself-healingmechanisms[7].Wenow
summarizethechallengesposedintheconstructionofadesiredindustrial-grade
time series anomaly detection framework:
– Lack of labels: In production-level business scenarios, the systems often pro-
cess millions of metrics. There is no easy way to label data on this scale
manually. Moreover, if the time series is in a dynamic environment where
the data distribution is constantly changing, then the model will need to be
retrained frequently on new data. Labelling this data can introduce a signifi-
cant delay and cost with a need to continuously update the models [3]. This
makes supervised models insufficient for the industrial scenario.
– Generalization: There are a large number of different metrics and scenarios
that time series anomaly detection can be applied to. In a typical produc-
tion environment, time series data can exhibit a range of different patterns
and variability. Industrial anomaly detection must work well on all kinds of
time series patterns. However, some existing approaches assume the shape of
data and are not designed to generalize and adapt to different patterns. For
example,Holt-Wintersshowsgoodperformanceinseasonaldatabutdoesnot
generalise well to unstable data [14].
– Efficiency and accuracy: In production scenarios, a monitoring system must
processmillionsoftimeseriesinnearreal-time.Especiallyforthesub-minute-
leveltimeseries,theanomalydetectionprocedureneedstobefinishedwithin
alimitedtime,i.e.,beforethenextdatapoint.Furthermore,ifthemonitoring
and anomaly detection system is running on a production node, it must not
use a lot of computing resources to respect the quota assigned for customers.
Therefore, even though models with large time complexity may achieve good
accuracy, they are often of little use in a production scenario.
– Onlinetrainingandupdate: Oncetrained,themodelshouldbeabletoupdate
online as new data is collected. Many existing anomaly detection approaches
are designed for settings that send data in batches rather than run-time
streams. This can lead to an old model being used until the new model has
been updated with new data. In a dynamic environment where the data can

tion accuracy.
– Parameter tuning: The existing anomaly detection algorithms require a lot
of parameter tuning to generate meaningful results. For example, a neural
network or deep learning-based method requires tuning of optimal hyper-
parameters and window-size for each metric. This can become complex and
time-consuming in production environments with a large number of metrics.
An approach that can automatically set parameters or requires little param-
eter tuning can be more easily deployed in a production environment.

In this paper, we focus on the framework for our anomaly detection service
for time series data. We propose a Statistical Learning-Based Metric Anomaly
Detection Framework (SLMAD) to spot anomalies at run-time for streaming
data while maintaining high efficiency and accuracy. SLMAD is based on an
unsupervised approach for anomaly detection that does not assume the shape
oftimeseriesdata,requiresverylittleparametertuning,detectsanomalies,and
updates online. SLMAD uses statistical-learning and employs a robust box-plot
algorithm and Matrix Profile (MP) [23] to detect anomalies.

2 Related Work
Existing approaches in anomaly detection can be categorised into statistical,
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches.
Statistical Anomaly Detection Methods: In the past years, several models have
been proposed in the statistical literature, including hypothesis testing [15],
wavelet analysis [11], SVD [12] and auto-regressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA) [24]. Statistical methods have become popular in recent years as they
consumemuchfewerresourcesthandeeplearningmodels,makingthemsuitable
for production deployment. However, there can be some limitations in terms of
anomaly detection accuracy.
Supervised Anomaly Detection Methods: Supervised models have shown impres-
siveaccuracyinarangeofcases.Opprenticehasoutperformedothertraditional
detectors by using statistical feature extractors and leveraged a random forest
classifier to detect anomalies [10]. EGADS developed by Yahoo utilises a col-
lection of anomaly detection and forecasting methods with an anomaly filtering
layer for scalable anomaly detection on time series data. Google has recently
leveraged deep learning models to detect anomalies in their data sets achieving
promisingresults[17].However,continuouslabelscannotbegeneratedtoretrain

in online applications. To mitigate the lack of labelled training data, Microsoft
injected synthetic anomalies into the time series and trained different types of
deep networks as binary classifiers [14]. In cases where the time series is sta-
tionaryandexhibitsnosignificantconceptdrift,ActiveLearningcanreducethe
data labelling requirements by selectively requesting user-feedback on the most
informativeexamples.Instance-basedTransferLearninghasbeencombinedwith
domain adaptation to further reduce labelling requirements with similar source
and target domains [19]. However, even with the reduction in labelled data,
some feedback or labelled data need to be used, which may not be available in
a production environment.
Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection Methods: Semi-supervised anomaly detec-
tion techniques do not require the entire data-set to be labelled. The model is
instead trained only on the normal data. Recent approaches have used neural
network techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) [1]. In this
method,anencoder-decodernetworkisusedtocreateagenerator,whichenables
the model to map the data to a lower dimension vector, which is then used to
reconstruct the original data. A distance metric from the learned data is then
used to indicate that a new data point is an outlier from the distribution. Semi-
supervised approaches share some of the problems as supervised approaches as
we need to know that there are no anomalies in the data.
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods: Due to the limitations of supervised
and semi-supervised approaches in real industrial applications, unsupervised
approaches have been proposed. DONUT is an unsupervised anomaly detec-
tion method based on Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) [5]. A large number of
technology companies have also developed anomaly detection methods due to
dealwiththelargestreamsofdata.LinkedIndevelopedamethodbasedontime
seriesbitmaps,whichallowsforassumption-freedetection[21].Anumberofthe
approaches have used forecasting, such as Alibaba RobustTAD [6], Facebook
Prophet [18], Amazon DeepAR+ [16], Uber RNN [9] and Microsoft SR-CNN
[14]. Deep-learning techniques have also become popular in recent years, but
they can be expensive to deploy in production. Twitter SH-ESD [8] employs a
lightweight approach to detect anomalies using the robust measures of scale.

methods developed by industry along with their features such as the approach
