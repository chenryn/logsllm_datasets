# Question about Next.js
i am curious about why this warning will occur. now i am using next.js 6.0.0
to develop my client side app. i have never use the 'url' property in my page-
level component, for my page -level component is generated by an hoc --
withDvaReduxHoc. never have i used the 'url' properiy, but dispear to me, i
think is unreasonable for i have never use the feature my cause warning.
or other props have use the 'url' property, when i get that props ? i have use
pathname and query in my apps, but i use these props in getInitialProps life-
cycle method, not the render method, will these properites cause an warning ?
and these props will be deprecated in the future ? if not, i couldn't find out
what cause this warning.
can u explain these to me?
