### Question about Next.js

I am currently using Next.js version 6.0.0 to develop my client-side application. I have encountered a warning, and I am curious as to why it is occurring. 

In my project, I have not explicitly used the `url` property in any of my page-level components. Instead, these components are generated by a Higher-Order Component (HOC) called `withDvaReduxHoc`. Since I have never used the `url` property, I find it unreasonable that it would cause a warning.

Could it be that some other props are using the `url` property, and if so, where are these props being set? In my application, I do use `pathname` and `query` properties, but I access them within the `getInitialProps` lifecycle method, not in the `render` method. Could these properties be causing the warning? Additionally, will these properties be deprecated in the future?

If they are not the cause, I am unable to determine what might be triggering this warning. Could you please explain this to me?
