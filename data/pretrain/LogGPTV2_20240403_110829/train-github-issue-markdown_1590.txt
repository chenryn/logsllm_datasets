Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
    removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift(); // removedFromOurArray now equals "Stimpson" and ourArray now equals ["J", ["cat"]].
    var myArray = ["John", 23, ["dog", 3]];
    // Only change code below this line.
    var removedFromMyArray;
    // Only change code above this line.
    (function(y, z){return 'myArray = ' + JSON.stringify(y) + ' & removedFromMyArray = ' + JSON.stringify(z);})(myArray, removedFromMyArray);
As you can see the removedFromOurArray variable was used but not declared , if
the user doesn't realise that then he won't be able to move forward and it
might discourage him.
