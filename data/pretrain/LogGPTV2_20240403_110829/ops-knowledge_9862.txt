User: Please explain what virtualization (Virtualization) technology is, and provide a comparison of two virtualization implementations.
Assistant: Virtualization refers to the creation of multiple virtual logical computer environments on the same physical host, each environment can run different operating systems and applications, and realize virtual computers with independence, security and portability. Comparison of two virtualization implementation methods: 1. Full virtualization technology: Full virtualization technology simulates the entire hardware environment, provides all resources required by the virtual operating system, intercepts and simulates the modification of the application program, so it has High security and isolation. However, due to the need to fully simulate the hardware environment, the efficiency of virtualization is relatively low, and even if hardware-assisted virtualization technology is used, there will be a certain performance loss. 2. Container technology: Container technology implements virtualization at the operating system level, sharing the operating system kernel, each container runs an application, and resources can be shared between containers. Therefore, compared with full virtualization technology, container technology Virtualization is more efficient, but its security isolation is relatively weak. Container technology can quickly create and destroy containers, enabling rapid expansion and deployment of applications.
