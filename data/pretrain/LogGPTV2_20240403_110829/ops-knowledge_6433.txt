User: I'm a fan of Ruby but I don't oppose Python.  ( I have 2+ years of Ruby experience and maybe 2 months of Python ).
Anyway, I need to create a service for both the Mac and Windows (and Linux, actually) that takes certain files from different directories and sends them to S3.  I could use .NET on Windows but I don't want to use Objective-C and I would love to keep my code-base the same on all platforms.
So after digging around a little, it looks like I should be able to compile either Ruby or Python to byte-code and distribute an interpreter to run the code. 
But, am I wrong in assuming that Python has better support for compiling code? As in .pyc byte code?
Also, I would prefer the end user not be able to read my source code but I'm not going to the end of the world to try and stop them.
Thanks!
Assistant: Use whatever language you know well, I know python and use that to develop windows desktop applications and end user can't distinguish it with say a C# or C++ app
