Abstract
While many radio technologies are available for mobile de-
vices, none of them are designed to deal with asymmet-
ric available energy. Battery capacities of mobile devices
vary by up to three orders of magnitude between laptops and
wearables, and our inability to deal with such asymmetry has
limited the lifetime of constrained portable devices.
This paper presents a radically new design for low-power
radios — one that is capable of dynamically splitting the
power burden of communication between the transmitter and
receiver in proportion to the available energy on the two de-
vices. We achieve this with a novel carrier ofﬂoad method
that dynamically moves carrier generation across end points.
While such a design might raise the specter of a high-power,
large form-factor radio, we show that this integration can
be achieved with no more than a BLE-style active radio aug-
mented with a few additional components. Our design, Braidio
is a low-power, tightly integrated, low-cost radio capable of
operating as an active and passive transceiver. When these
modes operate in an interleaved (braided) manner, the end
result is a power-proportional low-power radio that is able to
achieve 1:2546 to 3546:1 power consumption ratios between
a transmitter and a receiver, all while operating at low power.

INTRODUCTION
The growing demand for ultra-low power wireless com-
munication has led to a plethora of radio technologies in-
cluding Bluetooth Low Energy, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and other-
s. While these radios are low-power in nature, we argue that
there is one key dimension that existing radio designs have
overlooked — asymmetry in energy availability. Battery ca-
pacity of mobile devices is roughly proportional of their vol-
ume, which in turn varies substantially from laptop-class to
smartwatch-class devices. Figure 1 shows the battery ca-
pacity for several typical mobile devices [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10,
13, 15, 16, 17] (y axis in log scale). A battery on a laptop-
class device such as a Macbook Pro or Surface Book is three
orders of magnitude larger than a typical ﬁtness band, two
orders of magnitude larger than a typical smartwatch, and an
order of magnitude larger than a smartphone.
But commercial low-power radios are symmetric in pow-
er draw and have minimal ways to accommodate asymmet-
ric energy budgets. Table 1 shows two examples to illus-
trate — a Bluetooth CC2541 chip [8] supports power ratios
(Transmit vs Receive power) of 0.82× – 1.0× and a Blue-
tooth Low Energy CC2640 chip [9] supports power ratios
between 1.1× – 1.6×. This is a small dynamic range com-
pared to the orders of magnitude gap in energy availability.
In contrast, a radio that is designed to take into accoun-
t battery asymmetry would be power-proportional i.e.
the
power consumption at the transmitter and receiver would be

proportional to the available energy at the end point. A pow-
er proportional radio would allow a signiﬁcant fraction of
the energy cost of communication to be ofﬂoaded to the de-
vice that has more energy i.e. the mobile phone in the above
example, thereby increasing the lifetime of the wearable and
the overall duration of communication between the devices.
Our design, Braidio (a braid of radios), a radically new
radio design that is capable of dynamic carrier ofﬂoad i.e.
the ability to dynamically switch the transmission carrier be-
tween the transmitter and receiver. The rationale for carrier
ofﬂoad is that the power consumption of communication is
dominated by the cost of generating a carrier signal. Active
radios generate the carrier at both the transmitter and receiv-
er, therein the near-identical power consumption at both end-
s. Passive communication systems such as RFIDs generate
the carrier solely at the reader end, hence they support high-
ly asymmetric power consumption. Thus, if we were able
to combine the architectural building blocks of both active
and passive radios, we can design a radio that is capable of
moving carrier generation between the two end points. This
capability can, in turn, enable power-proportional wireless
communication wherein two devices with different battery
capacities can multiplex between the different carrier gener-
ation modes such that they consume power in proportion to
their available energy.
Dynamic carrier ofﬂoad is compelling, but the reality of
designing such a radio is also daunting. Passive backscatter
communication is designed to be ultra-low power at the tag,
but uses a rather bulky and power-hungry reader that con-
sumes watts of power, not milliwatts. For carrier ofﬂoad to
be practical, we need to be able to move the carrier across
end-points while incurring low power consumption.
We tackle this problem through an innovative architecture
that integrates the key components of both active and passive
radios, in particular carrier generation and self-interference
cancelation, while still operating at an end-to-end power con-
sumption comparable to active radios. Our key innovation is
the use of passive methods to cancel self-interference, which
paves the way for a low-power, yet high-performance, end-
to-end design. We are aware of no other attempt at combin-
ing active and passive radios into a low-power transceiver
that is capable of seamlessly switching between these modes.
Our results show that:
• Braidio can support transmitter–receiver power ratios
between 1:2546 to 3546:1 and enables a huge dynam-
ic range of asymmetry to suit a wide range of energy
budgets between end points.
• Braidio is low-power and consumes between 16uW –
129mW across the different modes, and is small form-
factor, making it practical for a range of mobile devices
from laptops to smartwatches.
• Braidio increases the total bits transmitted by several
orders of magnitude when compared with Bluetooth,
particularly when there is signiﬁcant asymmetry in bat-
tery levels.
2. ACTIVE AND PASSIVE RADIOS
We start by describing the architectures of active and pas-
sive radios, and pinpoint key performance bottlenecks.
2.1 Active Radio Architectures
Active radios like Bluetooth are quite symmetric in nature
as shown in Figure 2(a). The transmitter generates the carrier
(say 2.4 GHz or 915 MHz), phase shifts the carrier, passes it
through a mixer to generate the In-phase (I) and Quadrature
(Q) signals, and ampliﬁes the signal via a power ampliﬁer
before transmission. At the receiver side, the received signal
is ampliﬁed with a Low Noise Ampliﬁer, fed into a mixer to-
gether with a locally generated carrier, and ﬁltered to recover
the I and Q signals.
The reason for the symmetric power consumption is evi-
dent when we look at the architectural building blocks. The
transmitter and receiver are remarkably similar in terms of
the components that they use. Both generate the carrier and
have an IQ modulator/demodulator, and these components
consume most of the power. Thus, only relatively smal-
l differences in power consumption are possible between
the transmitter and receiver, primarily through changing the
transmit power level.
2.2 Passive Radio Architectures
Passive or Backscatter communication works very differ-
ently from active radios. In passive communication, the goal
is to ensure that the transmitter (or the tag) is an extremely
cheap, low-power and low-complexity device. Thus, backscat-
ter tags avoid power hungry components such as the carrier
generator, mixer and low-noise ampliﬁer that we saw in the
case of active radios. Instead, the reader takes on much of
the complexity, and allows the tag to operate simply by re-
ﬂecting the carrier signal back to the reader. This system
works as follows — the tag tunes and detunes its antenna
with its RF transistor, thereby modulating the incident car-
rier provided by the reader. The reader observes this on-off
backscattering pattern and can decode the signal.
Backscatter Tag Architecture
Since backscatter tags only need to reﬂect the incident car-
rier signal, their design is exceedingly simple. Figure 2(a)
and (b) show how a backscatter tag transmits and receives
data. Its transmitter end is simply an RF transistor that can
be modulated by a simple low-frequency clock that operates
at a few tens of kHz for ASK modulation, and around several
MHz for FSK modulation. At the receiver end, the tag us-
es an envelope detector that comprises of a comparator and
passive resistor/capacitor components and rectifying diode.

The detector itself consumes zero power since its a passive
circuit, making it ideal for tags.
Backscatter Reader Architecture
In contrast to tags, backscatter readers are fairly complicated
systems that are bulky and consume a lot of power. The
reader-side power consumption for commercially available
RFID reader chips is provided in Table 2, and we can see that
it ranges from several hundred milliwatts to a few watts. To
understand why, we need to explain more about how readers
work and what makes them complex.
The complexity of backscatter readers arises primarily from
the methods that they use to deal with self-interference —
the reader generates the carrier for the tag, but the strong
self-interference from the carrier can overwhelm the weak
backscattered signal.
How do readers manage self-interference: Commercial
readers use a combination of methods to deal with self- inter-
ference including: 1) isolation of the carrier from receiver, 2)
attenuation of self-interference with RF cancellation, and 3)
separation of the self-interference signal by converting it into
DC voltage. Isolation methods use either multiple antennas
386
or RF devices called directional couplers [44] to try to iso-
late the carrier [40]. RF cancellation is another widely used
technique, wherein the reader generates a cancellation signal
and adds it to the received signal. Finally, a third method is
to convert the signal including interference to baseband di-
rectly called Zero-IF. Here, the system uses a mixer with the
local oscillator working at exactly the carrier frequency (and
hence self-interference frequency), and converts the signal
to baseband in a single frequency conversion.
But these techniques do not come cheap. Directional cou-
plers tend to introduce insertion loss, and increases the trans-
mit power if user want to maintain the same output power.
RF cancellation requires an accurate estimate of the ampli-
tude and phase of the interference signal, which in turn re-
quires frequent channel measurements and extensive com-
munication. In addition, the cancellation signal needs to be
generated by the receiver, which consumes tens of milliwatts
of power. Direct conversion to baseband also requires car-
rier generation, mixing, and various ﬁlters which consumes
roughly 60mW of power.
3. BRAIDIO DESIGN
Our goal in Braidio is to design a radio that is minimalist,
integrated, and low-power such that it is practical on battery-
powered devices. To do so, the primary issue that we need
to deal with is the high power consumption when operating
in backscatter mode.
3.1 Design rationale and key insights
Can we do better than commercial readers in terms of
power consumption? When considering this question, we
need to be realistic; if we wish to dramatically reduce power
consumption, we have to be willing to sacriﬁce some sen-
sitivity. We simply cannot afford to use a combination of
high transmit power, RF cancellation and Zero-IF methods
used by commercial readers — in fact, even using any one
of them might take us over our target power budget. This
might seem like a major downside, but let us look at what is
the consequence of reduced sensitivity.
On a commercial reader, reduced sensitivity means inabil-
ity to read RFID tags at desired read ranges. This would be
problematic in real-world scenarios such as supply chain in-
ventory control where these readers are used. When viewed
from this lens, it is understandable why readers over-provision
to ensure high sensitivity while sacriﬁcing power efﬁcien-
cy. The energy budget is also not a huge constraint since
even hand-held RFID readers are intended to be the size of a
power-drill, not the size of a smartphone or wristband.
But reduced sensitivity in Braidio has entirely differen-
t consequences. For Braidio, a loss of sensitivity means
that we have to switch back to active mode from backscatter
