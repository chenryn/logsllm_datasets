## Abstract
While numerous radio technologies are available for mobile devices, none are specifically designed to handle asymmetric energy availability. The battery capacities of mobile devices vary by up to three orders of magnitude, from laptops to wearables, and this asymmetry limits the operational lifetime of energy-constrained portable devices.

This paper introduces a novel low-power radio design that dynamically distributes the power burden of communication between the transmitter and receiver based on their available energy. This is achieved through a new carrier offload method that dynamically shifts carrier generation between the two endpoints. Despite the potential for increased complexity, our design, Braidio, integrates seamlessly with existing BLE-style active radios and only requires a few additional components. Braidio operates as both an active and passive transceiver, enabling power-proportional communication with power consumption ratios ranging from 1:2546 to 3546:1 between the transmitter and receiver, all while maintaining low overall power consumption.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing demand for ultra-low power wireless communication has led to the development of various radio technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee, and Z-Wave. While these radios are inherently low-power, they fail to address a critical dimension: asymmetry in energy availability. The battery capacity of mobile devices is roughly proportional to their volume, which varies significantly from laptop-class to smartwatch-class devices. Figure 1 illustrates the battery capacity for several typical mobile devices, showing that a laptop-class device like a MacBook Pro or Surface Book has a battery capacity three orders of magnitude larger than a fitness band, two orders of magnitude larger than a smartwatch, and one order of magnitude larger than a smartphone.

Commercial low-power radios, however, are symmetric in power draw and offer limited ways to accommodate asymmetric energy budgets. For example, the Bluetooth CC2541 chip supports power ratios (transmit vs. receive power) of 0.82×–1.0×, and the Bluetooth Low Energy CC2640 chip supports power ratios of 1.1×–1.6×. These ranges are small compared to the orders of magnitude difference in energy availability.

In contrast, a radio designed to account for battery asymmetry would be power-proportional, meaning the power consumption at the transmitter and receiver would be proportional to the available energy at each endpoint. A power-proportional radio would allow a significant fraction of the energy cost of communication to be offloaded to the device with more energy, thereby increasing the lifetime of the energy-constrained device and the overall duration of communication.

Our design, Braidio (a braid of radios), is a radically new radio design capable of dynamic carrier offload, allowing the transmission carrier to be dynamically switched between the transmitter and receiver. The rationale for carrier offload is that the power consumption of communication is dominated by the cost of generating a carrier signal. Active radios generate the carrier at both the transmitter and receiver, leading to nearly identical power consumption at both ends. Passive communication systems, such as RFID, generate the carrier solely at the reader end, supporting highly asymmetric power consumption. By combining the architectural building blocks of both active and passive radios, we can design a radio that moves carrier generation between the two endpoints, enabling power-proportional wireless communication.

Dynamic carrier offload is compelling, but designing such a radio is challenging. Passive backscatter communication is designed to be ultra-low power at the tag but uses a bulky, power-hungry reader that consumes watts of power. For carrier offload to be practical, we need to move the carrier across endpoints while incurring low power consumption.

We tackle this problem through an innovative architecture that integrates the key components of both active and passive radios, particularly carrier generation and self-interference cancellation, while still operating at an end-to-end power consumption comparable to active radios. Our key innovation is the use of passive methods to cancel self-interference, enabling a low-power, high-performance, end-to-end design. We are not aware of any other attempt to combine active and passive radios into a low-power transceiver capable of seamlessly switching between these modes.

Our results show that:
- Braidio can support transmitter–receiver power ratios between 1:2546 to 3546:1, enabling a wide range of asymmetry to suit different energy budgets.
- Braidio is low-power, consuming between 16 μW to 129 mW across different modes, and has a small form factor, making it practical for a range of mobile devices from laptops to smartwatches.
- Braidio increases the total bits transmitted by several orders of magnitude compared to Bluetooth, especially when there is significant asymmetry in battery levels.

## 2. Active and Passive Radios
We begin by describing the architectures of active and passive radios and identifying key performance bottlenecks.

### 2.1 Active Radio Architectures
Active radios, such as Bluetooth, are symmetric in nature. The transmitter generates the carrier (e.g., 2.4 GHz or 915 MHz), phase-shifts the carrier, passes it through a mixer to generate the In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) signals, and amplifies the signal via a power amplifier before transmission. At the receiver side, the received signal is amplified with a Low Noise Amplifier, fed into a mixer with a locally generated carrier, and filtered to recover the I and Q signals.

The symmetric power consumption is evident from the architectural building blocks. Both the transmitter and receiver use similar components, including carrier generation and IQ modulator/demodulator, which consume most of the power. Thus, only small differences in power consumption are possible between the transmitter and receiver, primarily through changing the transmit power level.

### 2.2 Passive Radio Architectures
Passive or Backscatter communication works differently from active radios. The goal is to ensure that the transmitter (or tag) is an extremely cheap, low-power, and low-complexity device. Backscatter tags avoid power-hungry components such as the carrier generator, mixer, and low-noise amplifier. Instead, the reader takes on much of the complexity, allowing the tag to operate simply by reflecting the carrier signal back to the reader.

#### Backscatter Tag Architecture
Backscatter tags only need to reflect the incident carrier signal, making their design very simple. The tag's transmitter end is an RF transistor that can be modulated by a simple low-frequency clock for ASK modulation (tens of kHz) and FSK modulation (several MHz). At the receiver end, the tag uses an envelope detector comprising a comparator and passive resistor/capacitor components and a rectifying diode. The detector itself consumes zero power, making it ideal for tags.

#### Backscatter Reader Architecture
Backscatter readers, in contrast, are complex systems that are bulky and consume a lot of power. Table 2 shows the power consumption and cost of commercially available RFID reader chips, ranging from several hundred milliwatts to a few watts. The complexity arises from the methods used to deal with self-interference. The reader generates the carrier for the tag, but the strong self-interference from the carrier can overwhelm the weak backscattered signal.

Commercial readers use a combination of methods to manage self-interference, including:
1. Isolation of the carrier from the receiver.
2. Attenuation of self-interference with RF cancellation.
3. Separation of the self-interference signal by converting it into DC voltage.

Isolation methods use multiple antennas or directional couplers to isolate the carrier. RF cancellation involves generating a cancellation signal and adding it to the received signal. Direct conversion to baseband (Zero-IF) uses a mixer with the local oscillator working at exactly the carrier frequency to convert the signal to baseband in a single frequency conversion.

However, these techniques come at a cost. Directional couplers introduce insertion loss and increase transmit power. RF cancellation requires frequent channel measurements and extensive communication, and the cancellation signal consumes tens of milliwatts of power. Direct conversion to baseband also requires carrier generation, mixing, and filtering, which consumes approximately 60 mW of power.

## 3. Braidio Design
Our goal with Braidio is to design a minimalist, integrated, and low-power radio that is practical for battery-powered devices. The primary issue to address is the high power consumption when operating in backscatter mode.

### 3.1 Design Rationale and Key Insights
Can we achieve better power consumption than commercial readers? To do so, we must be realistic. If we aim to dramatically reduce power consumption, we must be willing to sacrifice some sensitivity. We cannot afford to use high transmit power, RF cancellation, and Zero-IF methods simultaneously, as even using one might exceed our target power budget.

Reduced sensitivity in commercial readers means an inability to read RFID tags at desired ranges, which is problematic in real-world scenarios like supply chain inventory control. However, reduced sensitivity in Braidio has different consequences. For Braidio, a loss of sensitivity means switching back to active mode from backscatter, which is a more manageable trade-off given the constraints of battery-powered devices.
