##### Issue Type:
Feature Idea
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.5.4
##### Environment:
Debian 7
##### Summary:
Ability to use useradd's -o flag "allow to create users with duplicate (non-
unique) UID"
##### Steps To Reproduce:
not possible
##### Expected Results:
This is useful if you want to create an ftp account with same permissions as
another user but chroot (with for example proftp's chroot ~ ) its home dir to
a directory further down the tree, thus locking it out from alot of the main
users directories but still have write access to its own home dir. (as both
users share uid/gid both have write access)
##### Actual Results:
not possible
