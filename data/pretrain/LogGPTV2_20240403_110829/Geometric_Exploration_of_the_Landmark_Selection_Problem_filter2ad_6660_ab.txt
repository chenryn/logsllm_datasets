For these reason we also report the 90th percentile of relative error.
In applying the algorithms for landmark selection we proceed as follows. In the
case of the AMP dataset, we select (cid:1) landmarks from the 116 hosts using each of the
algorithms. We then evaluate the relative error of the Virtual Landmarks embedding of
the remaining 116−(cid:1) hosts. In the case of the Skitter and Sockeye datasets, we subsample
2000 hosts at random from the set of measurement targets. We then select (cid:1) landmarks
from this set, and evaluate the relative error of the Virtual Landmarks embedding on the
active sites. For Skitter, this means we are evaluating the relative error over 12 hosts,
and for Sockeye, 11 hosts. Although these sample sizes are small, the consistency of our
results suggests that they are reasonably representative.
In Figures 4, 5, and 6 we present our main results. On the left in each ﬁgure is the
average absolute relative error, and on the right is the 90th percentile of absolute relative
error.
In the case of the AMP hosts (Figure 4), the Greedy algorithm performs distinctly
better than the others, regardless of the number of landmarks. The Random algorithm,
and the geometric algorithms (K-means and Maximum Distance) have very similar
performance, although the worst-case performance of Random is slightly poorer than
the other two.
These results may be understood in light of the nature of the AMP hosts, which
are generally sites in North America, with good connections to the high-speed Abilene
network. For these hosts, the particular choice of landmark set is not too critical, although
an expensive (Greedy) approach yields some beneﬁts.
The situation is rather different when looking at lardmark sets that span the Internet
as a whole, with more heterogeneous connectivity (Skitter and Sockeye datasets in
Figures 5 and 6). Here the Greedy algorithm is still best, as expected, but there is

a distinct difference between the others. Maximum Distance performs rather poorly,
possibly because the landmarks it ﬁnds, while far from most hosts, have relatively little
path diversity to the set of hosts, and therefore provide poor location information. K-
means performs well even when using only a small set of landmarks. The performance of
Random is poor when using a small set of landmarks, but surprisingly, it is comparable
to k-means when using a large set of landmarks. This effect is especially strong when
the metric of interest is the 90th percentile of absolute relative error.
These results suggest the following conclusions. First, the best-performing approach
is always the expensive Greedy algorithm; if resources permit, this is the best algorithm.
However, if a more efﬁcient algorithm is needed, then for a small number of landmarks
(5-10) the geometrically-based k-means algorithm is best; however, an even simpler and
faster option is to expand the larkdmark set (to approximately 20-30 landmarks) and
simply use Random selection.

7 Conclusions
In summary, we have advocated a geometric approach to Internet location analysis, and
based on that we have described and evaluated useful algorithms for landmark selection.
Motivated by the evidence of signiﬁcant clustering among Internet hosts, we explored
algorithms based on k-means and maximum distance, and compared them to greedy and
random alternatives. We ﬁnd that the greedy algorithm is best in all cases; however, it is
computationally expensive. Among the more efﬁcient algorithms, we ﬁnd that exploiting
clustering (k-means) is effective when the number of landmarks to be chosen is small
(5-10). However, if 20-30 landmarks are employed, then even simple random selection
works well. These results suggest that effective landmark selection appears feasible even
on the scale of the Internet.
