I'm currently a college student, and as part of my coursework, I collaborate with two other classmates on small Python projects every week. We use Eclipse with the PyDev plugin for our coding, but we've encountered an issue when it comes to sharing our work. Currently, we are constantly exchanging emails with compressed project files, which is becoming cumbersome and inefficient.

We need a more effective way to keep our source code up-to-date and to share it seamlessly between us, as some of us are using Windows and others are on Linux. Could you recommend a solution for this?

I highly recommend adopting a version control system to manage your collaborative coding. Git is an excellent choice for your needs. It allows you to track changes, manage different versions of your code, and easily share your work among team members. 

Git does not require a central server, making it flexible and easy to set up. Additionally, there is robust support for both Windows and Linux, so all team members can use it regardless of their operating system. You can also host your repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, which provide additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and continuous integration, further enhancing your collaboration experience.

Thank you in advance for your help!
