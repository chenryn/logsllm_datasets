 _Apologies is this is a dupe - I searched a number of different ways and
couldn't fine anything existing. Obviously, I'd be surprised if this hasn't
come up somewhere before._
Default syntax highlighting, and setting syntax highlighting for files without
a default works great in Atom - except for one significant thing: if Atom
doesn't have a syntax highlighting match for your filetype, then you have to
set it manually ever time you open a file of that type.
That gets quite cumbersome when, for example, you're working with a repo
filled entirely with `.liquid` files.
Other editors, like Sublime, handle this by offering an option to `Open all
with current extension as...` which lets you set a default syntax for all
files with that extension.

Since we're not offering a place to set filetype in the menubar (and certainly
not suggesting we should; setting from command palette is âœ¨), one simple way
to expose this could be to add an option to the command palette list for
syntax options for set all as this type.
