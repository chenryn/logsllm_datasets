### Request for Enhancing Syntax Highlighting in Atom

**Introduction:**
I apologize if this request has been made before. I conducted a thorough search but could not find any existing discussions on this topic. Given the nature of the issue, I would be surprised if it hasn't been raised previously.

**Current Behavior:**
Atom's default syntax highlighting and the ability to set syntax highlighting for files without a predefined type work well. However, there is one significant drawback: if Atom does not have a built-in syntax highlighter for a specific file type, you must manually set the syntax each time you open a file of that type. This can become cumbersome, especially when working with repositories containing numerous files of the same unsupported extension, such as `.liquid` files.

**Desired Feature:**
Other text editors, like Sublime Text, address this issue by providing an option to "Open all with current extension as...," allowing users to set a default syntax for all files with a particular extension. This feature significantly improves the user experience by reducing the need for repetitive manual settings.

**Example:**
In Sublime Text, you can right-click on a file and select "Open all with current extension as..." to set a default syntax for all files with the same extension. This feature is illustrated in the following image:

**Proposed Solution:**
Since Atom does not currently offer a way to set file types directly from the menubar (and I am not suggesting that we should add this), a simple and effective solution could be to include an option in the command palette. This option would allow users to set a default syntax for all files with a specific extension. For example, adding an option like "Set syntax for all files with this extension" to the command palette would streamline the process and enhance the user experience.

Thank you for considering this request.
