Table 8: Patterns and possible causes of mismatched AS paths
and AS H for the BGP path in Figure 2(d).
Table 7 summarizes the statistics, focusing on the ﬁrst mismatch
between each pair of AS paths. In each case, the “mismatch” be-
tween the two AS paths was nested within the path, starting with
an initial matching hop.
Our heuristics look for common occurrences of these “differ-
ences” across many AS paths to identify possible mistakes in the
IP-to-AS mapping applied to the traceroute AS paths. Finding mul-
tiple instances of each pattern increases the conﬁdence in our ex-
planation for why the paths differ and also makes our algorithms
more robust to transient routing changes that may affect the accu-
racy of some of the traceroute paths. In practice, some traceroute
paths may be affected by the results of multiple techniques, since
we apply the improved IP-to-AS mapping across all of the tracer-
oute paths. Our algorithms are based on the patterns we expect
from common operational practices. Table 8 summarizes the seven
root causes we consider, and the kinds of mismatch patterns they
can create. The ﬁrst three cases introduce mistakes in the IP-to-AS
mapping and are the focus of this section. The remaining four cases
are “legitimate” mismatches that do not necessarily stem from an
incorrect mapping; we defer discussion of these cases to the next
section. In practice, most of the items in Table 8 do not fall nat-
urally into a single “mismatch pattern”; therefore, our algorithms
need to look carefully across multiple instances of mismatch paths
to draw meaningful conclusions.
5.2 Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)
IXPs are junction points where multiple service providers meet
to exchange BGP routes and data trafﬁc. An IXP typically consists
of a shared infrastructure, such as an ATM switch or a FDDI ring,
with physical connections to routers in each of the participating
ASes. An IXP may have its own AS number and originate routes
to its infrastructure; alternatively, the address of the shared infra-
structure may be originated into BGP by one or more of the par-
ticipating ASes. In either case, different pairs of service providers
establish dedicated BGP sessions over the shared physical infra-
structure. At the IP level, the forwarding paths traverse the shared
equipment as shown in the left side of Figure 3. Yet, at the BGP
session level, the participating service providers connect directly to
each other, as shown in the right side of Figure 3. As a result, the
AS-level forwarding path appears to have an extra AS hop relative
to the corresponding BGP AS path, as shown earlier in Figure 2(a).
The patterns in Figure 3 for the AS-level forwarding and signal-
ing paths drive our algorithm for detecting IXPs. First, we inspect
cases where the traceroute AS path has an extra hop compared to
the corresponding BGP AS path; the extra hop could be a single
AS D or an individual preﬁx that maps to multiple origin ASes. In
practice, we do not expect to see the AS for an IXP to appear in any
BGP AS paths, except as the origin AS for the paths for the shared
equipment at the site. As such, the second step of our algorithm
removes from consideration any AS D that appears as a transit AS
in any BGP AS path. Finally, we expect an IXP to provide ser-
vice to several pairs of ASes. As such, we check the number of
unique ASes appearing just before and just after D; the example
in Figure 3 has a fan-in and fan-out of 3. For robustness, we ap-
ply a threshold for the minimum fan-in and fan-out; in this paper,
we apply a relatively small threshold of 2 since we only have mea-
surement data from eight vantage points. Ideally, a larger threshold
might be preferable for avoiding “false positives.”
We also apply an additional requirement that for AS pairs con-
sisting of the AS preceding and following the suspected IXP AS,
there must at least two pairs with no AS in common. In other words,
AS D is not considered as an IXP AS if it only appears as an extra
AS in traceroute AS paths such as XDB and BDY , where X and
Y are arbitrary ASes. As described in Section 5.3, AS B and D
are likely to be siblings. This requirement is to assure the path di-
versity of selected IXPs and prevent mistaking a sibling AS for an
IXP AS.
Applied to our measurement data, this algorithm found 477 cases
(of an AS or a preﬁx) with a fan-in and fan-out of 1 or more with
corresponding AS appearing in traceroute AS paths but not BGP
paths. Only 25 cases had fan-in and fan-out of at least 2 and sat-

Table 9: AS numbers and preﬁxes inferred as IXPs
isfy our criteria of an IXP; these cases are listed in Table 9 in de-
creasing order of fan-in and fan-out. To verify our results, we ﬁrst
queried whois using the AS number or preﬁx to see if the descrip-
tion contained the words “exchange point” or “Internet exchange”;
for example, AS 5459 was listed as “London Internet Exchange” in
whois.ripe.net. This check succeeded for 18 of our 25 inferences.
Then, we compared our results against a list of known IXPs [25].
This conﬁrmed 16 of the 25 inferences. Together, 19 of the 25 in-
ferences passed at least one of these checks. Some of the remaining
cases (highlighted in italics) may be IXPs, too; for example, Cal-
Ren is an exchange point for universities in California.
Inspecting the list of known IXPs, we ﬁnd that we missed 13
known IXPs. Among them, all but one had a fan-in of 1; for ex-
ample, the PAIX Seattle exchange point had a fan-in of 1 and a
fan-out of 5. The 13 cases include 2 NAPs (in Seattle and Miami),
4 European IXPs, 1 Asian IXP, 2 Equinix sites, and 4 small IXPs
in the exchange point block 198.32.0.0/16. We believe that our
algorithm missed these cases due to the small number of measure-
ment locations; in addition, our measurement sites connect directly
to large tier-1 providers in the U.S. except for one site connect-
ing to a large provider in Canada, limiting the number of ways the
traceroute paths could reach the IXPs. In the end, some of these re-
maining IXPs are potentially mistakenly placed in other categories
by the techniques described later in this section.
Using the list of IXPs generated by our algorithm, an AS-level
traceroute tool could indicate which IP-level hops map to exchange
points. We used our results to map these IP addresses to null ASes;
that is, we remove the IXP ASes and preﬁxes from the traceroute
AS paths. For example, a traceroute AS path with “B D E” would
become “B E” after removing AS D. The results of applying the
new IP-to-AS mapping across all of the traceroute paths is shown
in the “Internet Exchange Points” columns in Table 10. Compared
with the earlier results in Table 5, the number of matched paths
increased to 78.2-85.4%, corresponding to an increase of 1–4 per-
centage points. This occurs due to a decrease in both the number
of mismatched paths and the number of incomplete paths. For the

Figure 4: Traceroute and BGP AS paths with siblings
AS 6431 data, the IXP algorithm resolved more than half of the in-
complete paths with MOAS hops. We would expect more dramatic
results for sites that connect to smaller providers that tend to route
more of their trafﬁc through IXPs rather than private peering links.
5.3 Sibling ASes
In some cases, a single organization owns and manages multi-
ple ASes, sometimes as a result of mergers and acquisitions. The
ASes may share address space, with one AS numbering some of
its equipment using part of an address block originated by another.
This affects the mapping of traceroute hops to AS numbers, and
can lead to ambiguity about which AS actually carries the trafﬁc;
in some sense, the distinction between the two ASes may not be
important since they “belong together.” In the example at the top of
Figure 4, the traceroute AS paths includes ASes B and D though
the BGP AS path includes only one of the two ASes, as shown in
the bottom of the ﬁgure. This phenomenon can result in traceroute
AS paths that have an extra AS hop (B or D) relative to the cor-
responding BGP paths. Sibling ASes can also produce traceroute
paths with other patterns, as discussed in the next subsection.
The patterns in Figure 4 suggest a way to identify cases where
sibling ASes affect the traceroute AS path. Similar to the IXP al-
gorithm, we consider the fan-in and fan-out of traceroute AS paths
traversing a two-hop segment “B D” that corresponds to a single
AS hop in the corresponding BGP paths. For robustness, we apply
a threshold to the fan-in and fan-out; in this paper, we enforce a
minimum fan-in and fan-out of two. In addition, we focus on cases
where one of the two ASes (say, AS D) never appears in a BGP AS
path, except as an origin AS. That is, we assume that one AS (B) is
using the address space originated by the other AS (D), rather than
trying to capture cases where each AS borrows from the other.
In applying this algorithm to our data, we identiﬁed 28 pairs of
sibling ASes. The fan-in and fan-out were as large as 10 and 31,
respectively. To check our results, we inspected the whois entries
for the ASes and found that in 15 cases the two ASes had the same
organization name (e.g., ASes 1239 and 1791 belonged to Sprint
and ASes 1299 and 8233 belonged to TeliaNet). In the remaining
seven cases, the AS pairs appeared together as originating ASes for
one or more preﬁxes in the BGP routing tables, adding extra cred-
ibility to the conclusion that they are siblings. As part our future
work, we plan to compare our sibling inferences with the results of
algorithms for inferring AS relationships from BGP AS paths [19,
20].
We modiﬁed the IP-to-AS mapping based on these results to treat
sibling ASes as a single network. That is, we replaced every occur-
rence of B or D in the IP-to-AS mapping with the set {B, D}. We
