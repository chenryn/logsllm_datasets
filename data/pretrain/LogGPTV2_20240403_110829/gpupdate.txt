### gpupdate
**Purpose:** Updates Group Policy settings.

#### Syntax
```shell
gpupdate [/target:{computer | user}] [/force] [/wait:<seconds>] [/logoff] [/boot] [/sync] [/?]
```

#### Parameters

- **/target:{computer|user}**
  - **Description:** Specifies whether to update only User or only Computer policy settings. By default, both User and Computer policy settings are updated.
  
- **/force**
  - **Description:** Forces the reapplication of all policy settings. By default, only policy settings that have changed are applied.
  
- **/wait:<seconds>**
  - **Description:** Sets the number of seconds to wait for policy processing to complete before returning to the command prompt. If the time limit is exceeded, the command prompt will appear, but policy processing will continue in the background.
    - **Default Value:** 600 seconds (10 minutes)
    - **Value 0:** Do not wait.
    - **Value -1:** Wait indefinitely.
    - **Usage in Scripts:** You can use this parameter with a specified time limit to run `gpupdate` and then continue with other commands that do not depend on the completion of `gpupdate`. Alternatively, you can set it to no time limit to ensure `gpupdate` finishes before running dependent commands.
  
- **/logoff**
  - **Description:** Causes a logoff after the Group Policy settings are updated. This is necessary for client-side extensions that do not process policy during background updates but do so when a user logs on. Examples include user-targeted Software Installation and Folder Redirection. This option has no effect if there are no such extensions that require a logoff.
  
- **/boot**
  - **Description:** Causes a computer restart after the Group Policy settings are applied. This is required for client-side extensions that do not process policy during background updates but do so at computer startup. Examples include computer-targeted Software Installation. This option has no effect if there are no such extensions that require a restart.
  
- **/sync**
  - **Description:** Ensures that the next foreground policy application is done synchronously. Foreground policies are applied at computer boot and user logon. You can specify this for the user, computer, or both, using the `/target` parameter. The `/force` and `/wait` parameters are ignored if you use `/sync`.
  
- **/?**
  - **Description:** Displays help information at the command prompt.

#### Examples

- **Force a background update of all Group Policy settings:**
  ```shell
  gpupdate /force
  ```

This command forces the reapplication of all Group Policy settings, regardless of whether they have changed.
