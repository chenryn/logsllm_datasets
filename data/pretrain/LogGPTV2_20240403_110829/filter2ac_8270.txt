### Title: Remote Memory-Deduplication Attacks at Black Hat Asia 2022

#### Abstract:
Cloud providers often employ memory deduplication to optimize the memory utilization of their systems. This technique merges memory pages with identical content and maps them under a copy-on-write (COW) semantic. Previous research has demonstrated that, in a local context, memory deduplication can be exploited to break Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), perform Rowhammer attacks, and fingerprint applications. Consequently, countermeasures have been proposed to disable memory deduplication across security domains. However, memory deduplication is still enabled within a security domain on both Windows and Linux server systems.

In this presentation, we will introduce remote memory-deduplication attacks, showing that such attacks are not limited to local code execution but can also be mounted over the internet. We will demonstrate that web applications using in-memory caching, such as Memcached, can be remotely exploited without any user interaction. An attacker can leverage a remote timing side channel to leak sensitive information. Our experiments show that, through amplification, this side channel can leak up to 34.41 B/h across the internet, even over 14 hops.

We will also present methods for fingerprinting operating systems and shared libraries. Our remote Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) break can defeat KASLR on a remote server within minutes, using both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Additionally, by using a leakage primitive to manipulate the alignment of attacker-controlled data, we enable byte-by-byte data leakage from MySQL database records.

We will evaluate state-of-the-art mitigations and argue that some are insufficient to protect against remote memory-deduplication attacks. Finally, we will outline the challenges and future research directions for addressing these vulnerabilities.
