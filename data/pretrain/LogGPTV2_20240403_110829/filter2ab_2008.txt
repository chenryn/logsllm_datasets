**ATT&CK ID:** T1047  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

Adversaries may exploit Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads. WMI is a powerful administrative feature that provides a standardized interface for accessing and managing various components of the Windows operating system. The WMI service supports both local and remote access, with remote access typically facilitated through protocols such as Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) and Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

- **Remote WMI via DCOM:** Operates over port 135.
- **Remote WMI via WinRM:**
  - HTTP: Port 5985
  - HTTPS: Port 5986

By leveraging these protocols, adversaries can remotely interact with the WMI service to perform a wide range of malicious activities, including executing arbitrary code, gathering system information, and maintaining persistence on the target system.
