I want to use glide in a library and in my application.  
I know that I have to extends my glide module in the library from
"LibraryGlideModule" but when I use that and build my library project this
classes not generated "GlideRequest, GlideApp" . is there any example of using
LibraryGlideModule in glide 4.x?  
thanks.
