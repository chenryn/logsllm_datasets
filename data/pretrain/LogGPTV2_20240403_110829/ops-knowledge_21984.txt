User: In Twisted when implementing the dataReceived method, there doesn't seem to be any examples which refer to packets being fragmented. In every other language this is something you manually implement, so I was just wondering if this is done for you in twisted already or what? If so, do I need to prefix my packets with a length header? Or do I have to do this manually? If so, what way would that be?
Assistant: When dealing with TCP, you should really forget all notion of 'packets'. TCP is a stream protocol - you stream data in and data streams out the other side. Once the data is sent, it is allowed to arrive in as many or as few blocks as it wants, as long as the data all arrives in the right order. You'll have to manually do the delimitation as with other languages, with a length field, or a message type field, or a special delimiter character, etc.
