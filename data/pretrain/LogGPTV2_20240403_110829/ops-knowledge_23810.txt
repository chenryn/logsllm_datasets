User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题I'm leaving my job and want to erase as many personal details etc. as possible; any tips? Obviously this is very open-ended. But, I'm just paranoid about people going through everything on my laptop after I leave my job. Here are the things I'm planning to do:


Completely wipe all browser caches/histories/passwords, etc.
Delete my Skype database files and configurations so that nobody can log into my account for view my old messages.
Delete the Outlook data file for my gmail account, and the archive files for my work e-mail. I realize there's nothing I can do about the e-mails on my work e-mail account that are on the mail server... unless somebody has an idea?
Delete anything non-work related from the hard drive. Though, from what I understand, there are ways of restoring deleted files from a hard drive, right? Is there any way to prevent that, short of doing a DOD wipe on the entire drive?


That's about all I can think of. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Is there anything that the IT people might try to do that I'm not aware of? I'm not trying to hide anything weird or illegal; I'm just concerned about my personal privacy.

Thanks.

Assistant: The proper answer for this question is very situational, and dependent upon the policies and procedures in place at your company.  Many companies have in place methods of backing up portions of the drive meant for user data, or even the entire drive, across the corporate network.  If they've performed such backups on your system, there's nothing you can do to prevent them from accessing your data.

Beyond that, if your company allows, the only things you can do to definitively prevent restoration of your data off the laptop drive, is to do a secure wipe of that data or the whole drive, degauss, or outright destroy the drive.



EDIT:  While the above discusses what you might be able to do about your privacy now, there really is a larger issue at hand.

If you're really concerned about your personal privacy, don't use corporate resources for personal purposes.  Most companies have included in their Acceptable Use Policy or similar documentation, a clause that specifically says you may be subject to monitoring and have no expectation of privacy when using their systems.  In many jurisdictions, this means that they can do whatever they want to observe and record your activities with or without your explicit consent (generally, your consent is given implicitly upon your agreement to the AUP) and/or knowledge - causing any retroactive attempts at personal privacy to be futile and ineffective.

Case in point:  At one former workplace, I heard of a user who decided to do some, let's say, "very personal" web browsing on a company laptop while he was on his home network.  Apparently he was under some delusion that whatever he did with the company's hardware was none of their concern if he did it on his own Internet connection.  To be safe though, I'm sure he had some good history cleaning software in place and in use.  He was also technically savvy enough that he probably did some manual cleaning of his own, periodically.

What he didn't know was that the company had monitoring software installed locally and running in the background.  This software would record his Internet activities at all times, and relay the logs to the corporate servers whenever the laptop was connected to the intranet.  You can imagine the resulting disciplinary actions when this occurred.



TL;DR:  Keep your business on your hardware, and company business on company hardware.
