of scanned domains and ASes. Essentially the more domains are
scanned, the more ASes are covered, and more spoofable ASes are
discovered; see Figure 7. This result is of independent interest as it
implies that one can avoid scanning the IPv4 and instead opt for
domains-scan, obtaining a good enough approximation. This not
only reduces the volume of traffic needed to carry out studies but
also makes the study much more efficient.
Figure 7: As we scan more domains, we cover more ASes and
discover more spoofable ASes.
Further, to avoid single point of failure it is recommended that
the Name servers of a domain are hosted in multiple networks.
This is also our observation when correlating between domains
and ASes. Essentially we find that when testing one domain for
each server we can obtain different results, depending on the AS
that the server is hosted on.
The results of the ingress filtering measurements with SMap
are summarised in Table 3. The techniques that we integrated into
SMap (IPID, PMTUD, DNS lookup) were found applicable to more
than 92% of the measured ASes. Using SMap we identified 80%

check how many ASes host services of one domain: 70% of
the domains are hosted in one or two ASes.
of the ASes that do not enforce ingress filtering. In what follows
we compare the effectiveness of the techniques, explain causes for
false negatives and failures. In the rest of this section we explain
and analyse the applicability of our results and the success of the
different techniques, discuss errors and compare to the results in
previous studies.
4.3 Applicability and Success
As can be seen in Table 3 the most applicable technique is PMTUD
against Web servers, which applies to a bit more than 87% of the
ASes, yielded the highest fraction of spoofable ASes. This is not
surprising, since the number of web servers is much larger than the
others and it is recommended not to block ICMP to Web servers to
allow for path MTU discovery.
We next compare the success and applicability of tests with
PMTUD and IPID techniques against Email, Name and Web servers.
In order to compare the effectiveness of the PMTUD and IPID
measurement techniques as well as their applicability, we define
the spoofable and applicable rates, as follows:
Ratespoof able =
, Rateapplicable =
Nspoof able
Ntotal − NN A
Napplicable
Ntotal − NN A
The spoofable rate reflects the fraction of the networks found not
to apply ingress filtering and the applicable rate means applicability
of the test technique. The coverage of each of the three techniques
for different types of servers (Web, Name, and Email) is plotted in
Figure 9.

ASes according to service type.
Figure 9 shows that PMTUD technique (listed as “PMTUD_ANY”
in Figure 9) has a better test rate than either of the IPID and DNS
tests, which indicates that PMTUD is still widely supported. Be-
tween the other two, DNS test has a slightly higher applicability
than IPID test, which shows that globally sequential IPID is less
supported now. In Figure 11 we similarly see that the fraction of
spoofable networks that can be fonud through IPID and PMTUD
is higher than when measured with the other methodologies; Fig-
ure 11 plots the networks found spoofable via IPID vs PMTUD
excluding "N/A" networks.
In general, tests against Web servers have a higher applicability
rate than the tests with Email or DNS servers, regardless of which
technique was used (IPID or PMTUD). The number of Web servers is
much larger than the others. It is much easier to setup a Web server
than Email server or DNS server. Considering that DNS servers and
Email servers are more likely to be hosted by providers, they also
have higher probability to get new system updates. Furthermore,
we find that when a Web server is not available (“N/A”), both Email
and DNS servers cannot be tested, either. This also results in much
higher N/A outcomes for tests against Email and DNS servers as
opposed to Web servers.
The higher applicability of the tests against web servers also cor-
relates with a higher number of spoofable networks. In Figure 10,
we show the relationships between the applicability of SMap mea-
surement techniques to different services and the overlap between
them.
4.4 Errors
We define the result of SMap evaluation successful (i.e., true posi-
tive) if at least one of the three tests outputs that the tested network
does not filter spoofed packets: either the IPID value on the server
in the tested network was incremented as expected (IPID test) or
we receive a query at our domain (DNS test) or the server on the
tested network reduced the MTU of the packets sent to us (PMTUD
test). When either of the three techniques provides a positive result,
we mark the network as not filtering.
SMap does not make mistakes when reporting a network as not
filtering. However, it can have false negatives: when the scan does
not report network as not filtering when a network does not filter
spoofed packets.
Figure 11: Comparison of spoofability via IPID and PMTUD.
4.4.1 No False Positives. Our techniques are not susceptible to false
positives, that is, classification of the tested network as filtering
spoofed packets when in fact it does not do so. This is a side effect
of our methodology - only when spoofing is not filtered will the
“test action” be triggered.
IPID technique. When spoofing is not filtered the counter on
the server will be incremented - which is the test action. At the
probing phase the counter’s value will equal or large than the ex-
pected value after the increment phase. The repeated measurements
ensure that we do not accidentally interpret noise (i.e., packets from
other sources to the same server) as lack of ingress filtering.
DNS technique. When spoofing is not filtered the DNS resolver
on the tested network will receive a DNS request from a spoofed
IP address to our domain. Hence a query at our domain is the test
action that spoofed packets are not filtered.
PMTUD technique. Reduction of the MTU of the packets sent
from the test server to our network is the action which indicates
that spoofing filtering is not enforced.
False Negatives. False negatives in our measurements mean
4.4.2
that a network that does not perform filtering of spoofed packets
is not marked as such. We next list the causes of false negatives for
each of our three techniques. Essentially the false negatives cannot
be resolved, and therefore our measurement results of networks
that enforce ingress filtering introduce a a lower bound. The net-
works that we classify as those that do not apply ingress filtering -
1047ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
Tianxiang Dai and Haya Shulman
definitely allow packets from spoofed IP addresses into the network.
The networks which were not classified as “not enforcing ingress
filtering”, could still be “not enforcing ingress filtering”, but this
cannot be determined using our techniques.
IPID technique. Load balancing can introduce a challenge in
identifying whether a given network enforces ingress filtering. As
a result of load balancing our packets will be split between multiple
instances of the server, hence resulting in low IPID counter values.
There are different approaches for distributing the load to different
instances, e.g., random or round robin, which makes it impossible
to identify whether a “load-balanced-server” is on a network which
applies ingress filtering or not.
Anycasted server instances can also introduce a challenge in
inferring ingress filtering enforcement. We identified such cases by
performing traceroutes to the server.
DNS technique. Firewalls, blocking incoming packets on port
53, would as a result generate a similar effect as ingress filtering on
our servers: we would not receive any DNS requests to our domain.
However, such a setting does not indicate that the tested network
actually performs ingress filtering.
PMTUD technique. Firewalls are often configured to block
ICMP packets. In such case the evaluation result is similar as when
a tested network does not enforce ingress filtering: our PMTUD
packets will be blocked by the firewall, but not because they orig-
inate from an IP address that belongs to the tested network but
because the firewall blocks ICMP packets. This case can be identi-
fied by sending ICMP PMTUD packets from an IP address that does
not belong to the network. If the ICMP packets are not blocked
(but were blocked when the packets were sent from a spoofed IP
address) then the network does not block ICMP packets and does
enforce IP spoofing filtering. On the other hand if the packets are
blocked then one cannot determine if the blocking is done because
of ICMP or because of filtering of spoofed IP addresses.
4.5 Comparison with Other Measurements
To understand the effectiveness of our methodologies we compare
the results of our measurements with the active measurements of
ingress filtering performed by the CAIDA Spoofer Project. These
include two types of measurements: using traceroute and using
agents. The spoofer project is the only measurement study that
makes the datasets from their scans available online. The traceroute
approach and the agents approach are the only two other active
measurements of enforcement of ingress filtering (see Related Work
Section 2). We crawled all the 217,917 session reports in 2019 of
CAIDA Spoofer Project. These included 2,867 ASes with Spoofer
Project agents, and 2,500 ASes with Spoofer Project traceroute
loops (total of 5,367 ASes). Using our methodologies we measured
63,522 ASes, which is substantially more than the previous studies
all together. We compare between our results and the other two
methodologies below.
Traceroute Active Measurements. We analyse the datasets
from the traceroute measurements performed by the CAIDA Spoofer
Project within the last year 2019, [29]. The measurements identified
2,500 unique loops, of these 703 were provider ASes, and 1,780
customer ASes. The dataset found 688 ASes that do not enforce
ingress filtering. Out of 688 ASes found with traceroutes by the
Spoofer Project, we could not test 4 ASes (none of our tests applied)
and 36 ASes were not included in our tests (those ASes could not be
located from domain names - due to our attempt to reduce traffic
and not to scan IPv4 but to collect the services via domain names).
The rest of the ASes agree with our measurement results.
Agents Active Measurements. Agents with active probes found
608 ASes that were found not to be enforcing ingress filtering using
the agents approach of the Spoofer Project (these include duplicates
with the traceroute loops measurements). Those contain some of
the duplicates from traceroute measurements: together both ap-
proaches of the Spoofer Project found 1,113 ASes to be spoofable.
Apart from 57 ASes not included in our tests, we could not test 9
ASes, the rest were also identified by our tests.
Although the agents provide the optimal setup for testing filter-
ing, with control over the packets that can be crafted and sent from
both sides, as we explain in Related Work Section 2, this approach
is limited only to networks that deploy agents on their networks.
In contrast, SMap provides better coverage since it is potentially
applicable to every network that has one of the services that are
required in our tests.
In total, our results identified 51,046 ASes to be spoofable, which
is more than 80% of the ASes that we tested. This is also 50,023
ASes more than that both the traceroute and the agents approaches
found.
These findings show that SMap offers benefits over the existing
methods, providing better coverage of the ASes in the Internet
and not requiring agents or conditions for obtaining traceroute
loops, hence improving visibility of networks not enforcing ingress
filtering.
5 NETWORKS ANALYSIS
In order to understand if there are differences in enforcement of
ingress filtering between different network types and different
countries, we perform characterisation of the networks that we
found to not be filtering spoofed packets. Specifically, we ask the
following questions: Does business type of networks or geo-location
of networks influence filtering of spoofed packets?
To derive the geo-location of ASes we used MaxMind GeoLite2
GeoIP database [1]. The results are listed in Table 5. The tested ASes
are distributed across different countries, with most ASes being in
large countries, like US and Russia. The ration of spoofable ASes
ranges between 67% and 84%, with Ukraine leading with the fraction
of spoofable networks, with 84%. Surprisingly the ratio between the
geolocation and spoofed packets is similar across different countries,
with USA and Russia leading with 32% of the networks and 33% of
the networks respectively, that do not filter spoofed packets.
We also want to understand the types of networks that we could
test via domains-wide scans. To derive the business types we use
the PeeringDB. We classify the ASes according to the following
business types: content, enterprise, Network Service Provider (NSP),
Cable/DSL/ISP, non-profit, educational/research, route server at
Internet Exchange Point (IXP)1 We plot the networks that do not
enforce ingress filtering according to business types in Figure 12.
