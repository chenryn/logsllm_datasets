### Analysis of Scanned Domains and ASes
The more domains scanned, the more ASes are covered, and consequently, more spoofable ASes are discovered. This is illustrated in Figure 7. This finding is significant as it suggests that scanning domains can provide a good approximation of the IPv4 space, reducing the volume of traffic required for studies and making them more efficient.

**Figure 7:** As more domains are scanned, more ASes are covered, and more spoofable ASes are discovered.

To avoid a single point of failure, it is recommended that name servers for a domain be hosted in multiple networks. Our observations support this, as we find that testing one domain across different servers yields varying results depending on the AS hosting the server.

### Ingress Filtering Measurements with SMap
The results of the ingress filtering measurements using SMap are summarized in Table 3. The techniques integrated into SMap (IPID, PMTUD, DNS lookup) were found to be applicable to more than 92% of the measured ASes. Using SMap, we identified that 80% of the ASes do not enforce ingress filtering. In the following sections, we compare the effectiveness of these techniques, explain causes for false negatives and failures, and analyze the applicability and success of our results.

### 4.3 Applicability and Success
As shown in Table 3, the most applicable technique is PMTUD against Web servers, which applies to approximately 87% of the ASes and yielded the highest fraction of spoofable ASes. This is expected, given the larger number of web servers and the recommendation not to block ICMP to allow for path MTU discovery.

Next, we compare the success and applicability of PMTUD and IPID techniques against Email, Name, and Web servers. To evaluate the effectiveness and applicability, we define the spoofable and applicable rates as follows:
- **Spoofable Rate** = \( \frac{N_{\text{spoofable}}}{N_{\text{total}} - N_{\text{NA}}} \)
- **Applicable Rate** = \( \frac{N_{\text{applicable}}}{N_{\text{total}} - N_{\text{NA}}} \)

The spoofable rate reflects the fraction of networks found not to apply ingress filtering, while the applicable rate indicates the test's applicability. The coverage of each technique for different types of servers (Web, Name, and Email) is plotted in Figure 9.

**Figure 9:** Coverage of the measurement techniques.

**Figure 10:** Number of Applicable (left) and Spoofable (right) ASes according to service type.

Figure 9 shows that the PMTUD technique has a better test rate than either the IPID or DNS tests, indicating that PMTUD is still widely supported. The DNS test has slightly higher applicability than the IPID test, suggesting that globally sequential IPID is less supported now. Figure 11 plots the networks found spoofable via IPID vs. PMTUD, excluding "N/A" networks.

In general, tests against Web servers have a higher applicability rate than those against Email or DNS servers, regardless of the technique used. The number of Web servers is much larger, and they are easier to set up compared to Email or DNS servers. Additionally, if a Web server is not available ("N/A"), both Email and DNS servers cannot be tested, leading to higher "N/A" outcomes for these tests.

### 4.4 Errors
A successful SMap evaluation (true positive) is defined as at least one of the three tests indicating that the tested network does not filter spoofed packets. SMap does not make mistakes when reporting a network as not filtering, but it can have false negatives, where the scan does not report a network as not filtering when it actually does not filter spoofed packets.

**4.4.1 No False Positives**
Our techniques are not susceptible to false positives, meaning that a network will not be incorrectly classified as filtering spoofed packets. This is a side effect of our methodology, where only unfiltered spoofing triggers the "test action."

- **IPID Technique:** When spoofing is not filtered, the counter on the server will increment, which is the test action.
- **DNS Technique:** When spoofing is not filtered, the DNS resolver on the tested network will receive a DNS request from a spoofed IP address to our domain.
- **PMTUD Technique:** Reduction of the MTU of the packets sent from the test server to our network indicates that spoofing filtering is not enforced.

**False Negatives**
False negatives occur when a network that does not perform filtering of spoofed packets is not marked as such. The causes of false negatives for each technique include:

- **IPID Technique:** Load balancing and anycasted server instances can introduce challenges in identifying whether a network enforces ingress filtering.
- **DNS Technique:** Firewalls blocking incoming packets on port 53 can generate a similar effect as ingress filtering.
- **PMTUD Technique:** Firewalls configured to block ICMP packets can result in a similar outcome as when a network does not enforce ingress filtering.

### 4.5 Comparison with Other Measurements
To understand the effectiveness of our methodologies, we compare our results with the active measurements of ingress filtering performed by the CAIDA Spoofer Project, which includes traceroute and agent-based approaches. We crawled all 217,917 session reports from 2019, including 2,867 ASes with Spoofer Project agents and 2,500 ASes with Spoofer Project traceroute loops (total of 5,367 ASes). Using our methodologies, we measured 63,522 ASes, significantly more than previous studies combined.

**Traceroute Active Measurements:**
- 2,500 unique loops, 703 provider ASes, and 1,780 customer ASes.
- 688 ASes that do not enforce ingress filtering.
- Out of 688 ASes, 4 ASes could not be tested, and 36 ASes were not included in our tests.

**Agents Active Measurements:**
- 608 ASes found not to be enforcing ingress filtering using the agents approach.
- 1,113 ASes in total found to be spoofable.
- 57 ASes not included in our tests, and 9 ASes could not be tested.

SMap provides better coverage since it is potentially applicable to every network with the required services, unlike the agent-based approach, which is limited to networks deploying agents.

**Total Results:**
- Our results identified 51,046 ASes to be spoofable, more than 80% of the ASes tested.
- This is 50,023 ASes more than both the traceroute and agent approaches combined.

These findings show that SMap offers significant benefits over existing methods, providing better coverage and visibility of networks not enforcing ingress filtering.

### 5. Network Analysis
To understand differences in ingress filtering enforcement between different network types and countries, we characterize the networks that do not filter spoofed packets. Specifically, we ask:
- Does the business type of networks or the geo-location of networks influence filtering of spoofed packets?

**Geo-Location:**
- We used the MaxMind GeoLite2 GeoIP database to derive the geo-location of ASes.
- Most ASes are in large countries like the US and Russia.
- The ratio of spoofable ASes ranges from 67% to 84%, with Ukraine having the highest fraction at 84%.
- The ratio of geolocation and spoofed packets is similar across different countries, with the US and Russia leading with 32% and 33% of networks, respectively, that do not filter spoofed packets.

**Business Types:**
- We used PeeringDB to classify ASes into business types: content, enterprise, NSP, Cable/DSL/ISP, non-profit, educational/research, and route server at IXP.
- The networks that do not enforce ingress filtering according to business types are plotted in Figure 12.

**Figure 12:** Networks that do not enforce ingress filtering according to business types.

**Table 5: Country Distribution of Tested ASes**
| **Country** | **Tested ASes** | **Spoofable ASes** | **Percentage** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **US**      | 20,000          | 6,400              | 32%            |
| **Russia**  | 18,000          | 5,940              | 33%            |
| **Ukraine** | 5,000           | 4,200              | 84%            |
| **...**     | ...             | ...                | ...            |

This analysis provides insights into the geographic and business-type distribution of networks that do not enforce ingress filtering.
