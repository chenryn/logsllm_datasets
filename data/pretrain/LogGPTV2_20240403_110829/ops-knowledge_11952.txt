To effectively implement CIS Control 16.12, "Implement Code-Level Security Checks," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Integrate Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools**: Incorporate static and dynamic code analysis tools into the application development lifecycle. These tools help identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure that secure coding practices are being followed.

2. **Regular Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to detect and address security issues early in the development process. This can include peer reviews, automated code scanning, and manual inspections.

3. **Security Training for Developers**: Provide ongoing security training for developers to enhance their understanding of secure coding practices and common security vulnerabilities. This helps in proactively preventing security issues from arising.

4. **Define and Enforce Secure Coding Standards**: Establish and enforce clear secure coding standards and guidelines. Ensure that all developers are aware of and adhere to these standards to maintain a consistent and secure coding environment.

5. **Automated Testing and Continuous Integration**: Implement automated testing and continuous integration (CI) processes to automatically run security checks as part of the build and deployment pipeline. This ensures that security is integrated at every stage of the development process.

CIS Control 16.12 focuses on the asset type "Applications" and falls under the security function "Protect." By following these procedures, organizations can significantly enhance the security of their applications and reduce the risk of security breaches.
