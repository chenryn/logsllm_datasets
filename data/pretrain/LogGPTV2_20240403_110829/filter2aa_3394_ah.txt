APPENDIX E.    GLOSSARY
A
access method
The ability and means necessary to store data, retrieve data, or communicate with
a system. FDMA, TDMA and CDMA are examples. [8]
analog modulation
technique
Process whereby message signal, which is the analog of some physical quantity, is
impressed on a carrier signal for transmission through a channel (e.g. FM). [10]
analog signal
1. A signal that has a continuous nature rather than a pulsed or discrete nature.
Note: Electrical or physical analogies, such as continuously varying voltages,
frequencies, or phases, may be used as analog signals. 2. A nominally continuous
electrical signal that varies in some direct correlation with another signal
impressed on a transducer.  Note: For example, an analog signal may vary in
frequency, phase, or amplitude in response to changes in physical phenomena,
such as sound, light, heat, position, or pressure. [7]
antenna
Any structure or device used to collect or radiate electromagnetic waves. [7]
audio throughput delay
Waiting time delay from audio input at sending unit until audio output at receiving
unit. [8]
B
backward compatibility
Ability of new units to operate within an "old" system infrastructure or to directly
intercommunicate with an "old" unit. [8]
bandwidth
The difference between the limiting frequencies of a continuous frequency band.
Typically measured in kilohertz.  May be considered the amount in kilohertz
required for a single communications channel. [8]
base station
1. A land station in the land mobile service.  2. In personal communication service,
the common name for all the radio equipment located at one fixed location, and
that is used for serving one or several calls. [7]
baseband
The original band of frequencies produced by a transducer, such as a microphone,
telegraph key, or other signal-initiating device, prior to initial modulation.  Note 1:
In transmission systems, the baseband signal is usually used to modulate a carrier.
Note 2: Demodulation recreates the baseband signal.  Note 3: Baseband describes
the signal state prior to modulation, prior to multiplexing, following
demultiplexing, and following demodulation.  Note 4: Baseband frequencies are
usually characterized by being much lower in frequency than the frequencies that
result when the baseband signal is used to modulate a carrier or subcarrier. [7]
C
call congestion
The ratio of calls lost due to a lack of system resources to the total number of calls
over a long interval of time. [8]
call delay
The delay experienced when a call arriving at an automatic switching device finds
no idle channel or facility available to process the call immediately. [8]
call setup time
The overall length of time required to establish a circuit-switched call between
users or terminals. [8]
carrier
1. A wave suitable for modulation by an information-bearing signal.  2. An
unmodulated emission.  Note: The carrier is usually a sinusoidal wave or a
uniform or predictable series of pulses.  Synonym: carrier wave.
carrier frequency
1. The nominal frequency of a carrier wave.  2. In frequency modulation, synonym
center frequency. [7]
carrier sense multiple
access (CSMA)
A network control scheme in which a node verifies the absence of other traffic
before transmitting. [7]
catastrophic degradation
The rapid reduction of the ability of a system, subsystem, component, equipment,
or software to perform its intended function.  Note: Catastrophic degradation
usually results in total failure to perform any function. [7]

channel
A single unidirectional or bidirectional path for transmitting or receiving, or both,
of electrical or electromagnetic signals. [8]
channel capacity
The maximum possible information transfer rate through a channel, subject to
specified constraints. [7]
channel rate
The data rate at which information is transmitted through the channel, typically
stated in bits per second (bps). [8]
channel spacing
Typically measured in kilohertz from the center of one channel to the center of the
next-adjacent-channel.  May, or may not, be identical to bandwidth. [8]
channelization
The use of a single wideband, i.e., high-capacity, facility to create many relatively
narrowband, i.e., lower capacity channels by subdividing the wideband facility. [7]
code-division multiple
access (CDMA)
A coding scheme, used as a modulation technique, in which multiple channels are
independently coded for transmission over a single wideband channel.  Note 1: In
some communication systems, CDMA is used as an access method that permits
carriers from different stations to use the same transmission equipment by using a
wider bandwidth than the individual carriers.  On reception, each carrier can be
distinguished from the others by means of a specific modulation code, thereby
allowing for the reception of signals that were originally overlapping in frequency
and time.  Thus, several transmissions can occur simultaneously within the same
bandwidth, with the mutual interference reduced by the degree of orthogonality of
the unique codes used in each transmission.  Note 2: CDMA permits a more
uniform distribution of energy in the emitted bandwidth. [7]
collision
In a transmission system, the situation that occurs when two or more demands are
made simultaneously on equipment that can handle only one at any given instant.
[7]
communications system
A collection of individual communications networks, transmission systems, relay
stations, tributary stations, and data terminal equipment usually capable of
interconnection and interoperation to form an integrated whole.  Note: The
components of a communications system serve a common purpose, are technically
compatible, use common procedures, respond to controls, and operate in unison.
[7]
comparator
In land mobile service, a functional unit that compares strengths of a signal
received by different receiving stations and selects the strongest for further
processing.
conventional radio system
Non-trunked, similar to telephone party-line in that the user determines availability
by listening for an open channel. [10]
coverage
1. In radiocommunications, the geographical area within which service from a
radiocommunications facility can be received. [7]  2. The geographic area
included within the range of, or covered by, a wireless radio system.  Two systems
cannot be made compatible through patching unless the coverage areas overlap.
[10]
D

for communication, interpretation, or processing by humans or by automatic
means.  Any representations such as characters or analog quantities to which
meaning is or might be assigned. [7]
data communication
The transfer of information between functional units by means of data transmission
according to a protocol.  Note: Data are transferred from one or more sources to
one or more sinks over one or more data links. [7]
de-key
Turn the transmitter off (release the Push-to-Talk switch). [8]
delay time
The sum of waiting time and service time in a queue. [8]
demodulation
The recovery, from a modulated carrier, of a signal having substantially the same
characteristics as the original modulating signal. [7]
demultiplexing
The separation of two or more channels previously multiplexed; i.e., the reverse of
multiplexing. [7]

desensitization
The reduction of desired signal gain as a result of receiver reaction to an undesired
signal.  Note: The gain reduction is generally due to overload of some portion of
the receiver resulting in desired signal suppression because the receiver will no
longer respond linearly to incremental changes in input voltage. [7]
digital
Characterized by discrete states. [7]
digital modulation
technique
Technique for placing a digital data sequence on a carrier signal for subsequent
transmission through a channel. [10]
digital signal
A signal in which discrete steps are used to represent information.  Note 1: In a
digital signal, the discrete steps may be further characterized by signal elements,
such as significant conditions, significant instants, and transitions.  Note 2: Digital
signals contain m-ary significant conditions. [7]
digital speech interpolation
In digital speech transmission, the use of periods of inactivity or constant signal
level to increase the transmission efficiency by insertion of additional signals. [7]
digitalization
The migration from analog to digital communications technologies.
duplexer
A device that isolates the receiver from the transmitter while permitting them to
share a common antenna.  Note 1: A duplexer must be designed for operation in
the frequency band used by the receiver and transmitter, and must be capable of
handling the output power of the transmitter.  Note 2: A duplexer must provide
adequate rejection of transmitter noise occurring at the receive frequency, and
must be designed to operate at, or less than, the frequency separation between the
transmitter and receiver.  Note 3: A duplexer must provide sufficient isolation to
prevent receiver desensitization. [7]

during a period of time, usually a busy hour.  Note 1: Erlangs, a number between 0
and 1, inclusive, is expressed as the ratio of (a) the time during which a facility is
continuously or cumulatively occupied to (b) the time that the facility is available
for occupancy.  Note 2: Communications traffic, measured in erlangs for a period
of time, and offered to a group of shared facilities, such as a trunk group is equal
to the average of the traffic intensity, in erlangs for the same period of time, of all
individual sources, such as telephones, that share and are served exclusively by
this group of facilities.  Synonym traffic unit. [7]

versus outgoing calls, and is not necessarily equal in each direction.  2. In
telephony, the quality of service for which a circuit is designed or conditioned to
provide, e.g., voice grade or program grade.  Note: Criteria for different grades of
service may include equalization for amplitude over a specified band of
frequencies, or in the case of digital data transported via analog circuits,
equalization for phase also. [7]
H
half-duplex operation
Operation in which communication between two terminals occurs in either
direction, but only one direction at a time.  Note: Half-duplex operation may occur
on a half-duplex circuit or on a duplex circuit, but it may not occur on a simplex
circuit.  Synonyms one-way reversible operation, two-way alternate operation.
