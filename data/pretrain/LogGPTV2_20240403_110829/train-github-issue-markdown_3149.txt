Hi guys,
I've been looking for a way to learn web development and have really been
enjoying the material you guys have put together, so thank you.
I have a login issue I can't figure out and didn't see a duplicate looking
through the issues.
#### Issue Description
  * When I login with github from my mac mini on any browser, it does not work. I get a red error saying `Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later`. I get redirected back to http://www.freecodecamp.com/map, and I'm not logged in.
Things I have tried on the mac mini:
  * Github login after hard refresh / clearing all of the browser cache
  * Github login on Firefox, Safari, Chrome
  * Github login in private browsing mode (all browsers)
But the weird thing is, I can successfully use github to login with 3 other
computers:
  * Acer Chromebook (ChromeOS 48.0.2564.116 (64-bit))
  * Macbook Pro (OSX El Capitan)
  * Thinkpad (Ubuntu 14.04)
#### Browser Information (mac mini)
  * Firefox 43.0.4
  * Chrome 49.0.2623.87 (64-bit)
  * Safari 9.0.3 (11601.4.4)
  * OS: OSX El Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21)

#### Other Information
I have HAR files of logging in using the mac mini (error) and chromebook
(success) for the GET requests of:
  * GET github
  * GET authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri...
  * GET callback?code=...
  * (mac mini, error) GET map
  * (others, success) GET trigger-click-events-with-jquery
I can share a link to these files to you privately, but I would rather not
post them here in case the files have my cookie information, and they're a bit
big (12 MB total).
