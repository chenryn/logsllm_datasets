Assistant: The following are the steps to implement file sharing and access control on Windows Server: 1. Create a shared folder: Open "File Explorer", select the folder to be shared, right-click and select "Sharing and Security". 2. Select a sharing option: On the Sharing tab, select Share this folder. 3. Configure permissions: Under the Share Permissions option, click the Add button. In the Select User or Group dialog box, enter the name of the user or group to add and click Check Names. After confirming that it is correct, click the "OK" button and configure the corresponding sharing permissions. 4. Configure Security: On the Security tab, click the Edit button. In the Security Settings dialog box, click the Add button. In the Select User or Group dialog box, enter the name of the user or group to add and click Check Names. After confirmation, click the "OK" button and configure the corresponding security permissions. 5. Configure advanced security: In the Advanced tab, click the Advanced button. Select the user or group to be configured, and click the "Edit" button. In the Object Properties dialog box, select the Security tab and configure a complete access control list (ACL) for the user or group. 6. Test access: After completing the above configuration, use the user account on another computer to test whether the access permissions of the shared folder are set as expected. Notes: 1. When configuring sharing, it is recommended to use a guest account or a separate sharing account. 2. When configuring permissions and security, be careful not to over-authorize. 3. Before configuration, make sure that "File and Printer Sharing Service" is enabled.
