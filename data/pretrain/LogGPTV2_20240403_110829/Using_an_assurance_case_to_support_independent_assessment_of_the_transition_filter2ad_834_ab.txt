between  transition  phases  and  the  division  of  system 
responsibilities. Together, these factors suggested that the 
phases  were  an  appropriate  dimension  along  which  to 
decompose the assurance case. 
In  addition  to  the  transition  plan,  however,  there  was 
also  a  contingency  “fallback”  plan  in  which  operations 
could  revert  to  Legacy  in  the  event  of  unforeseen 
problems.  To  account  for  the  fallback  plan  in  the 
assurance  case,  we  first  decomposed  the  argument  into 
two  convergent  branches:  one  arguing  that  the  transition 
would  be  successful  and  another  arguing  that  fallback  to 
Legacy  was  possible  from  any  step  in  the  transition.  We 
then decomposed each branch by transition phase. 
We  describe  the  first  branch  of  the  assurance  case  in 
Section  5.  While  our  analysis  revealed  no  evidence  that 
fallback would  be  problematic,  we  were  unable  to  obtain 
sufficient  documentation  on  fallback  to  complete  this 
branch of the argument. We recommended, however, that 
the  lack  of  argument  for  fallback  was  not  a  high  enough 
risk to warrant postponing the transition, for three reasons.  
First, fallback was only a contingency plan and would not 
be  needed  at  all  if  the  main  branch  of  the  argument 
(normal transition) held. Second, if both normal transition 
and fallback experienced problems, the satellites would be 
able  to  operate  adequately  for  enough  time  that  the 
problem could likely  be  solved.  Third,  fallback  scenarios 
were executed successfully during EPOT rehearsals. 
5. Assurance Case 
We  expressed  the  EPOT  assurance  case  in  the  Goal 
Structuring  Notation  (GSN)  [2].  GSN  enables  graphical 
depiction of an argument structure. In GSN, an initial top-
level assurance goal is decomposed, using strategies, into 
subgoals,  repeating  the  decomposition  process  until  the 
argument can be supported by direct evidence. We believe 
that  representing  the  argument  graphically  makes  its 
structure  more  explicit  and,  hence,  more  amenable  to 
analysis  than  it  would  be  in  a  textual  form  [2].  The 
elements of GSN used here are shown in Figure 3. 
5.1. Top-Level Argument 
The  top-level  argument  for  the  EPOT  assurance  case 
is  shown  in  Figure  4.  It  begins  with  the  top-level  goal— 
GTopLevel—that  EPOT  will  be  conducted  so  as  to 
minimize  the  operational  impact  to  users.  The  argument 
then  decomposes  the  top-level  goal  into  two  subgoals. 
GContinuityOfService  supports  EPOT  correctness,  and 
GFallbackPossible  supports  the  capability  to  fall  back. 
These  goals  are,  in  turn,  supported  by  their  respective 
branches of the argument, described below. 
5.2. Argument Leg Supporting EPOT Adequacy 
This  argument  leg  uses  system  context  to  define 
“adequacy”  as  service  that  is  consistent  with  the  service 
provided by Legacy. The argument is then decomposed by 
EPOT  phase.  StEPOTPhaseDecomp  refers  to  these 
phases; the phases themselves inform the strategy, so they 
are 
in  CEPOTPhases.  This 
decomposition strategy produces three more subgoals. 
included  as  context 
GEPOTPhase_i  is  a  replicated  subgoal  (denoted  by 
0..3 on the arrow from the strategy) representing the four 
different  generated  subgoals  that  correspond  to  the  four 
different  phases  of  EPOT.  GPhaseTransitions  ensures 
that service is not interrupted during state transitions. For 
reasons of space, we present only the interesting  findings 
from the remainder of the argument for these goals. 
GPhaseDecompValidity shows that decomposing the 
argument  based  on  the  phases  was  appropriate.  The 
detailed  state  analysis  described  above  was  used  to 
support this goal; that analysis is included as evidence (as 
noted in the diagram by its Aerospace report number). 
Three  argument  branches  show  adequacy  for  specific 
transitions  (GPhaseTransitions).  (1)  Phase  0  to  1  and  1 
to  2  transfers:  service  is  adequate  because  Legacy 
provides  service  throughout.  (2)  Phase  2  to  3  transfer: 
service  is  adequate  because  the  transition  is  immediate. 
(3)  A  separate,  convergent  argument  strengthens  the 
previous two by showing that all of the transition intervals 
are shorter than the allowable outage time.

5.3. Argument Findings 
• 
We identified several issues using the assurance  case; 
all  of  these  issues  were  resolved  after  further  interaction 
with our experts. 
• 
Phases 0 and 1: We were unable at first to show that 
AEP  would  not  interfere  with  Legacy  operations.  A 
domain  expert  helped  us  address  this  goal  by 
describing  the  interfaces  and  the  communication 
mechanisms between Legacy and AEP. 
• 
• 
Phase  2:  The  argument  that  Legacy  will  not  hinder 
AEP  at  first  appeared  to  be  missing,  but  our  experts 
explained  that  the  argument  was  based  on  the 
system’s physical connection structure. 
Phase  2:  We  were  concerned  about  how  and  when 
AEP  took  control  of  some  of  the  external  interfaces. 
The  concern  was  resolved  by  further  explanation 
from  our  experts,  and  by  the  outcome  of  transition 
rehearsals designed to catch any such omissions. 
Phase  3:  We  were  concerned  that  the  mix  of  NGA 
and  monitoring  station  data  might  lead  to  a  higher 
divergence  in  the  Kalman  filter  data  than  was 
permissible.  Our  experts  explained  that,  while  the 
sources used by Legacy and AEP might be different, 
they  were  tracking  the  same  value  (i.e.,  the  GPS 
signal); the precision might differ, but the values were 
not  expected  to  diverge  beyond  a  certain  point.  This 
theory  was  tested  and  validated  during  transition 
rehearsals,  and  was  documented  as  an  argument 
assumption. 
GSN’s explicit provision for documenting assumptions 
was considered to be very useful by our colleagues. They 
observed that undocumented assumptions about interfaces 
frequently cause problems in systems. 
5.4. Assurance Case Summary 
A  summary  of  the  elements  of  the  assurance  case  is 
shown in Table 2 to indicate the argument’s size. We also

include  statistics  for  the  major  revisions  of  the  argument 
to  show  how  our  interaction  with  colleagues  and  experts 
improved  the  argument.  Initial  represents  the  initial  draft 
of the assurance case. V2 represents the revision after we 
had incorporated comments; it is slightly smaller because 
of  some  restructuring  for  clarity,  but  it  contained  more 
detailed arguments. Final  represents  the  final  state  of  the 
argument,  although  we  changed  the  conclusions  and 
recommendations but did not create  a  new  version  of  the 
assurance. We include it here to emphasize that there were 
no significant known risks when the transition occurred.

6. Conclusions 
The  study  identified  no  major  risks  to  the  AEP 
transition,  and  the  transition  was  completed  successfully. 
Although  it  is  possible  that  the  study  missed  major  risks 
which  simply  did  not  materialize,  the  transition’s  success 
provides validation of the study’s result. 
We  were  able  to  use  the  safety  case  to  identify  risks 
much  more  effectively  than  we  were  able  to  use  the 
procedural  documentation  to  do  the  same.  Because  we 
were assessing risks derived from the computing system’s 
operation,  rather  than  risks  that  the  procedures  could  not 
be  carried  out,  the  procedures  were  only  an  indirect 
indicator  of  the  subject  of  the  study.  The  system  states 
used in the assurance case provided a direct subject. Also, 
the  assurance  case  enabled  us  to  create  and  present  our 
argument  in  a  structured  fashion;  the  act  of  creating  the 
argument forced us to be more structured in our thinking. 
The  main  drawback  of  using  a  graphical  notation  to 
represent  the  assurance  case  is  that  it  encouraged  us  to 
spend  time  rearranging  the  depiction  of  the  argument 
structure  for  clarity  and  elegance.  The  branching  of  the 
diagrams makes them somewhat hard to read and difficult 
to  present  so  that  reviewers  can  follow  them  easily.  
Presentation  ability  is  key  because  the  size  of  the 
argument,  the  amount  of  domain  knowledge  needed  to 
follow  it,  and  the  details  that  were  not  easily  captured  in 
the  available  structures  of  the  notation.  A  modified 
process  combining  graphical  and  textual  elements  might 
improve our results. 
We also used the assurance case to communicate with 
our  experts,  explaining  the  problems  we  had  found.  We 
then  used  it  to  produce  a  briefing  that  led,  in  part,  to  the 
decision  to  proceed  with  the  transition.  We  feel  that  this 
validates  our  hypothesis  that  an  assurance  case  is  an 
appropriate tool to use in assuring a system transition. 
We  have  shown  how  assurance  cases  can  be  used  to 
support  the  upgrade  of  an  influential,  long-running 
system. They could also be used to support other forms of 
maintenance  activity;  the  super-system  model  where,  for 
instance,  phases  of  maintenance  are  used  to  structure  the 
argument might be used for a database update. 
Finally, while assurance cases are generally created by 
a  system’s  developers,  in  this  instance  we  created  it  to 
help  us  decide  whether  the  system  transition  plan  would 
be approved. This shows the potential for assurance cases 
created  by  regulators,  even  if  the  case  is  not  presented 
initially as part of an acceptance package.
