User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple attempts to initialize the mod_jk child workerEnv. The first three lines show that the workerEnv is in error state 6. Lines 4-10 show that jk2_init() is finding children in different scoreboard slots. Lines 11-14 show that workerEnv.init() is ok, but the mod_jk child workerEnv is in error states 6, 8, and 7. Lines 15-20 show that workerEnv.init() is ok, but the mod_jk child workerEnv is still in error state 6.
