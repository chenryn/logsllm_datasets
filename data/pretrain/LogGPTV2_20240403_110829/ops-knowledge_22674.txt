User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题File permissions are being changed after gunzip of .gz file; how do I prevent that? I have an NFS4 filesystem that has AD based authentication setup and ACLS to match.  I am controlling access to the machines that mount the filesystem so the ACLs are very basic.  One prevents users from renaming or deleting folders at the parent level.  A second ACL gives "Everyone" and "Domain Users" full access for "Subfolders, and Files"

the problem I have is on one of the subfolders there is a *.pax.gz" file.  If I log in to a Linux client and cd to that folder I am able to see the file and the correct permissions.  If I run gunzip "filename" it then creates a *.pax file but the "Everyone" and "Domain Users" permissions are gone and I become the owner of that file. 

Is it possible to set an ACL or anything at all that would have  the end result be the *.pax file retaining the same permissions that the *.pax.gz file has?

Assistant: You need to add ACEs into parent directory with 'f' and 'd' flags to enforce newly created files and directories to inherit that ACEs.


  from nfs4_acl man page:

   INHERITANCE FLAGS - can be used in any directory ACE

   d      directory-inherit - newly-created subdirectories will inherit the ACE.

   f      file-inherit  -  newly-created files will inherit the ACE, minus its inheritance flags.  Newly-created subdirectories
          will inherit the ACE; if directory-inherit is not also specified in the parent ACE, inherit-only will be added to the
          inherited ACE. 
   n      no-propagate-inherit - newly-created subdirectories will inherit the ACE, minus its inheritance flags.

   i      inherit-only  -  the ACE is not considered in permissions checks, but it is heritable; however, the inherit-only flag
         is stripped from inherited ACEs.
