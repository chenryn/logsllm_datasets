User: I want to execute one python script in Jupyter, but I don't want to use the web browser (IPython Interactive terminal), I want to run a single command in the Linux terminal to load & run the python script, so that I can get the output from Jupyter. 
I tried to run jupyter notebook %run <my_script.py>, but it seems jupyter can't recognize %run variable.
Is it possible to do that?
Assistant: You can use the jupyter console -i command to run an interactive jupyter session in your terminal. From there you can run import <my_script.py>. Do note that this is not the intended use case of either jupyter or the notebook environment. You should run scripts using your normal python interpreter instead.
