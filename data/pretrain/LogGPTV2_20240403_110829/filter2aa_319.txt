## Disclaimer
This is early-phase research with limited citations. Many researchers have contributed to this field, but our goal is to make these types of attacks more accessible and cost-effective.

## Introduction to PCIe
### What is PCIe?
- **PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)** is not the same as PCI. 
- **PCIe** is a high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard designed to replace older standards like PCI, AGP, and others.

### Key Concepts
- **Links and Lanes**: Diagram from PCIe 2.1 specification.
- **Hierarchy**: Diagram from PCIe 2.1 specification.
- **Switching and Routing**: Diagram from PCIe 2.1 specification.
- **Layers**: Diagram from PCIe 2.1 specification.
- **Configuration Space**: Multiple diagrams from PCIe 2.1 specification.
- **Enumeration**: Diagram from PCIe 2.1 specification.

### Routing PCIe
- **Rules for Routing PCIe**:
  1. Route pairs should be adjacent and of equal length.
  2. Follow these rules to ensure your board functions correctly; breaking them may result in failure.

- **Minimum PCIe Requirements**:
  - 2.5GHz TX
  - 2.5GHz RX
  - 100MHz Clock (optional)

### Getting PCIe on Things Without It
- **SLOTSCREAMER**:
  - Introduced by Steve Weis in his Black Hat 2014 talk "Protecting Data In-Use from Firmware and Physical Attacks."
  - Similar sources for NSA Ant catalog product details.

- **Thunderbolt**:
  - USB3380.c
  - USB3380 Firmware
  - Example firmware dump: `xxd SLOTSCREAMER.bin`

## Attacking via PCIe
### Target-side Software
- None

### Attack-side Software
- **Quick and Dirty PCIe Memory Read/Write with PyUSB**:
  - Demo: Memory read/write

- **More Attack-side Software**:
  - Example code snippets for memory manipulation and signature matching.

### Taking Dumps
- **DMA Stool Analysis with Volatility**:
  - dmesg log of the attack recovered from the memory dump of the victim.
  - Names, PIDs, and UIDs for dumped processes.
  - Extracted machine information.
  - The perfect amount of memory to dump!

### Thunderbolt
- Diagram: Apple Thunderbolt Device Driver Programming Guide
- **HALIBUTDUGOUT**:
  - DIY project
  - More information at [nsaplayset.org](http://nsaplayset.org)

### Tools Used
- **Hardware**:
  - PLX Flashing Software
  - [hwtools.net/PLX.html](http://www.hwtools.net/PLX.html)

- **Software**:
  - pyusb + scripts
  - inception_pci
  - Volatility for memory analysis

## Mitigations
### Bus Master Enable
- Command to check BusMaster status:
  ```sh
  joefitz@linUX31a:~/Documents/pcie/SLOTSCREAMER/inception_pci$ lspci -vv | grep BusMaster
  ```

- Example output:
  ```
  Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B- DisINTx-
  ```

### IOMMU
- Abstinence? Because 0.01% is too much.

## ALLOYVIPER
