User: Python seems to have functions for copying files (e.g. shutil.copy) and functions for copying directories (e.g. shutil.copytree) but I haven't found any function that handles both. Sure, it's trivial to check whether you want to copy a file or a directory, but it seems like a strange omission.
Is there really no standard function that works like the unix cp -r command, i.e. supports both directories and files and copies recursively? What would be the most elegant way to work around this problem in Python?
Assistant: shutil.copy and shutil.copy2 are copying files.
shutil.copytree copies a folder with all the files and all subfolders. shutil.copytree is using shutil.copy2 to copy the files.
So the analog to cp -r you are saying is the shutil.copytree because cp -r targets and copies a folder and its files/subfolders like shutil.copytree. Without the -r cp copies files like shutil.copy and shutil.copy2 do.
