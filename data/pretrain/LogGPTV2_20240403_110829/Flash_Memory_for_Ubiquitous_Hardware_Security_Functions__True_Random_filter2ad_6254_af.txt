Figure 17. Device authentication through a challenge-response protocol.  
Unless an adversary can predict which CRPs will be used 
for authentication, the adversary needs to measure all (or at 
least  a  large  fraction)  of  possible  fingerprints  from  an 
authentic  Flash  chip  and  store  them  in  an  emulator.  In  our 
prototype board, a generation of all fingerprints from a single 
page (16K bits) takes about 10 seconds and requires 10 bits 
of storage for each Flash bit. For a 16Gbit (2 GB) Flash chip, 
which  is a  moderate  size by  today’s  standards,  this  implies 
that fully characterizing the chip will take hundreds of days 
and  20  GB  storage.  In  the  context  of  counterfeiting,  such 
costs  are  likely  to  be  high  enough  to  make  producing 
counterfeits economically unattractive.  
The security of the authentication scheme based on Flash 
fingerprints can be further improved if an additional control 
can  be  added  to  the  Flash  interface.  For  example,  imagine 
using  a  USB  Flash  memory  as  a  two-factor  authentication 
token by updating its firmware to have a challenge-response 
interface  for  Flash  fingerprints.  Given  that  authentication 
operations only need to be infrequent, the USB stick can be 
configured  to  only  allow  a  query  every  few  seconds.  If  a 
fingerprint is based on 1024 Flash bits, fully characterizing 
an 8 GB USB stick can take tens of years. 
D.  Cryptographic Keys 
In addition to device identification and authentication, the 
Flash  fingerprints  can  be  used  as  a  way  to  produce  many 
independent secret keys without additional storage. In effect, 
the  proposed  Flash  fingerprints  provide  unpredictable  and 
persistent numbers for each device. Previous studies such as 
fuzzy  extractors  [17]  and  Physical  Unclonable  Functions 
(PUFs)  [3]  have  shown  how  symmetric  keys  (uniformly 
distributed random numbers) can be obtained from biometric 
data  or  IC  signatures  from  manufacturing  variations  by 
applying  hashing  and  error  correction.  The  same  approach 
can  be  applied  to  Flash  fingerprints  in  order  to  generate 
reliable cryptographic keys. A typical Flash with a few GB 
can potentially produce tens of millions of 128-bit symmetric 
keys. 
VII.  RELATED WORK 
A.  Hardware Random Number Generators 
some 
Hardware  random  number  generators  generate  random 
numbers  from  high-entropy  sources  in  the  physical  world. 
Theoretically, 
random  physical  processes  are 
completely  unpredictable.  Therefore,  hardware  random 
number generators provide better random numbers in terms 
of randomness than software based pseudo-random number 
generators. 
Thermal  noise  and  other  system  level  noise  are  the 
common  entropy  sources  in  recently  proposed  hardware 
random  number  generators.  In  [18],  the  phase  noise  of 
identical  ring  oscillators  is  used  as  the  entropy  source.  In 
[19], the differences in path delays are used. In [20] and [21], 
the metastability of flip-flops or two cross coupled inverters 
are used. Basically, the entropy source of these RNG designs 
is  thermal  noise  and  circuit  operational  conditions.  These 
hardware  random  number  generators  can  usually  achieve 
high  throughput  because  the  frequency  of  the  entropy 
sources  is  high.  One  common  characteristic  of  these 
hardware  random  generators  is  that  they  all  need  carefully 
designed  circuits  where  process  variations  should  be 
minimized  so  that  noises  from  the  entropy  source  can  be 
dominant. Compared to this, the random number generation 
in  Flash  memory  cells  does  not  require  specially  designed 
circuits and is more immune to process variation. Moreover, 
our  entropy  source  is  based  on  quantum  behavior  and 
theoretically,  it  should  still  work  under  extremely  low 
temperatures  where  thermal  noise  or  other  kinds  of  noise 
decrease dramatically. 
B.  Hardware Fingerprint – Physical Unclonable Funcitons 
Instead of conventional authentication based on a secret 
key  and  cryptographic  computation,  researchers  have 
recently  proposed  to  use  the  inherent  variation  in  physical 
characteristics  of  a  hardware  device  for  identification  and 
authentication. Process variation in semiconductor foundries 
is a common source of hardware uniqueness which is out of 
the  control  of  the  designer  [22]  [23]  [24].  A  unique 
fingerprint can be extracted and used to identify the chip, but 
cannot  be  used  for  security  applications  because  it  can  be 
simply  stored  and  replayed.  We  also  take  advantage  of 
process variation for our fingerprinting scheme.  
For security applications, Physical Unclonable Functions 
(PUFs)  have  been  proposed.  A  PUF  can  generate  many 
fingerprints  per  device  by  using  complex  physical  systems 
whose  analog characteristics cannot  be perfectly  replicated. 
Pappu  initially  proposed  PUFs  [25]  using  light  scattering 
patterns  of  optically 
In  silicon, 
researchers  have constructed circuits  which, due to random 
transparent

process  variation,  emit  unique  outputs  per  device.  Some 
silicon  PUFs  use  ring  oscillators  [26]  or  race  conditions 
between  two  identical  delay  paths  [27].  These  PUFs  are 
usually implemented as custom circuits on the chip. Recently, 
PUFs have been implemented without additional circuitry by 
exploiting  metastable elements  such as  SRAM cells,  which 
have unique value on start-up for each IC instance [28] [4], 
or in Flash memories [5].  
Our authentication scheme requires no new circuitry and 
can  be  done  with  commercially  available  and  ubiquitous 
Flash chips. Unlike metastable elements, authentication does 
not  require  a  power  cycle.  The  scheme  can  generate  many 
fingerprints  by  using  more  pages  in  the  Flash  chip. 
Acquiring  a  fingerprint  is  also  faster  and  more  widely 
applicable than previous Flash authentication methods. 
VIII.  CONCLUSION 
tests.  An 
authentication 
In  this  work,  we  show  that  unmodified  Flash  chips  are 
capable of providing two important security functions: high-
quality true random number generation and the provision of 
many  digital  fingerprints.  Using  thermal  noise  and  random 
telegraph noise, random numbers can be generated at up to 
10Kbit  per  second  for  each  Flash  bit  and  pass  all  NIST 
randomness 
scheme  with 
fingerprints  derived  from  partial  programming  of  pages  on 
the  Flash  chip  show  high  robustness  and  uniqueness.  The 
authentication  scheme  was  tested  over  24  pages  with  24 
different  instances  of  a  Flash  chip  and  showed  clear 
separation.  A  Flash  chip  can  provide  many  unique 
fingerprints 
in  various 
temperature  and  aged  conditions.  Both  random  number 
generation  and  fingerprint  generation  require  no  hardware 
change to commercial Flash chips. Because Flash chips are 
ubiquitous,  the  proposed  techniques  have  a  potential  to  be 
widely deployed to many existing electronic device though a 
firmware update or software change.
