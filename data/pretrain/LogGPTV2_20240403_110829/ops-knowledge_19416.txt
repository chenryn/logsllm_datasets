User: How to expand the capacity of the Linux system file system?
Assistant: Expanding the Linux system file system can be carried out through the following steps: 1. Confirm the hard disk partition status, and use the command `df -h` or `sudo fdisk -l` to check the disk and partition status. 2. To expand the size of the partition, use the command `sudo fdisk /dev/[disk name]` to enter the partition editing mode, enter the `p` command to print the partition table, and record the number of the partition to be extended. Then enter `d`, `n`, `p` in turn, delete the partition and recreate the partition, and expand the partition to the required size. Enter the `w` command, save the changes and exit. 3. Reload the partition table, use the command `sudo partprobe` to reload the partition table, and re-identify the partition. 4. To check the status of the partition file system, use the command `sudo resize2fs /dev/[disk name][partition number]` to check the status of the partition file system. 5. Adjust the size of the file system, use the command `sudo resize2fs /dev/[disk name][partition number]` to adjust the size of the file system. 6. To check whether the file system modification is successful, use the command `df -h` to check whether the disk space is normal. The above operations need to be performed carefully to ensure data security. It is best to do this after backing up your data.
