User: I used brew to install python 2.7 and now my mac have 2 python version
on in /usr/bin/python and another on in /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12_2/
pip installed oursql to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
what should i do about it?
Assistant: Finally got it work after I symlink with brew's python
It was not symlinked into /usr/local
The command is simply brew link python and now which python will point to /usr/local/bin/python
