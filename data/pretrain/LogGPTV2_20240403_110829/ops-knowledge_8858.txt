**User:** I used Homebrew to install Python 2.7, and now my Mac has two versions of Python: one in `/usr/bin/python` and another in `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12_2/`. Additionally, `pip` installed the `oursql` package to `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. What should I do about this?

**Assistant:** To resolve the issue, you can create a symbolic link to the Homebrew-installed Python version. By default, Homebrew does not automatically symlink the newly installed Python into `/usr/local`, which is why you have two versions.

To make the Homebrew-installed Python the default, run the following command:

```bash
brew link python
```

After running this command, the `which python` command will point to `/usr/local/bin/python`, ensuring that the Homebrew-installed Python 2.7 is used by default.
