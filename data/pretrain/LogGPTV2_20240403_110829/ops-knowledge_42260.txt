User: I have SSHed from my local machine (a Mac) to a remote machine called “ten-thousand-dollar-bill” as the user “chilge”.
I want to run a Python script in the folder “/afs/athena.mit.edu/c/h/chilge/web_scripts” that generates and saves a .png image to the folder “/afs/athena.mit.edu/c/h/chilge/www/TAF_figures/KORD/1407”. When I run the script from the command line, the image is generated and saved without any issues. When I run the script as cron job, though (the crontab resides in “/afs/athena.mit.edu/c/h/chilge/cron_scripts”), I get the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

I believe I’ve correctly changed the permissions of all of the necessary directories, but I’m still getting this error. I am not sure why the script would run fine from the command line, but fail when I try to run the script as a cron job.
(Also, I’m not sure if this will be relevant, but don’t have sudo permissions on the remote machine.)
Assistant: Maybe an other software opens the file which you want to overwrite?
