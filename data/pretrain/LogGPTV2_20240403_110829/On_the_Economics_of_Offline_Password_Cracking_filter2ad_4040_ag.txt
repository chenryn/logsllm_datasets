We observe that a user password pwd
user passwords, in expectation.
Proof of Theorem 2:
t = pwdi will
be certainly cracked if V × Pr[pwd] = Vpi ≥ k since
the marginal cost of including an extra guess pwd in the
dictionary is at most k. Thus, the adversary will compromise
at least
i:pi≥k/V fi accounts. The problem with this lower
bound is that we need to know pi = Pr[pwdi] for each
password pwdi to compute it. However, the values pi are
unknown if we do not make assumptions about the shape of
the password distribution. However, we can lower bound this
quantity. In particular, we say that the estimate ^pi = fi/N
NL, but fi ≥ j. Let
is a (j, L)-bad overestimate if pi  k ≥ maxt MC(t) the marginal
reward of guessing pwdi always exceeds the marginal
cost. Thus, a rational attacker must eventually guess pwdi.
