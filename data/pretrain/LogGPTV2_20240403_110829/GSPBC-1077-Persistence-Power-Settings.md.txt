| 1 | 1.
Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.
Perform routine inspections of controls/weapons
3.
Maintain Antivirus/EDR application updates
4.
Create network segmentation
5.
Log traﬃc between network segments
6.
Incorporate threat intelligence
7.
Perform routine inspections of asset backups
8.
Conduct user security awareness training
9.
Conduct response training (this PBC)
10.
Perform regular audits of your systems to scan for any new or known vulnerability,
insecure conﬁgurations or potential weakness[2]                 | 1.
Monitor for:
a.
Commands or arguments that may aﬀect the power settings of your
systems, such as a command to prevent a workstation from going to
sleep [3]
b.
Unexpected modiﬁcations to conﬁguration ﬁles related to power settings
[4]
2.
Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets or accounts
3.
Routinely check ﬁrewall,
IDS,
IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual activity                   | 1.
Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2.
Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.
Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.
Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations
5.
Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
6.
Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.
Fortify non-impacted critical assets                           |  |  |
| 2 | (E) Eradication | (R) Recovery      | (L) Lessons/Opportunities |  |  |
| 3 | 1.
Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.
Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.
Reset any compromised passwords
4.
Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle
5.
Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle PRIOR to system recovery
6.
Patch asset vulnerabilities                 | 1.
Restore to the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) within the RTO (Recovery Time
Objective)
2.
Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.
Resolve any related security incidents
4.
Restore aﬀected systems to their last clean backup                   | 1.
Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.
Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.
Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.
Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.
Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a
chain of behavior that could lead to other activities
6.
Be aware that when a system is kept online,
it allows a malicious actor to use that
system to strengthen their foothold within the network [1]                           |  |  |
