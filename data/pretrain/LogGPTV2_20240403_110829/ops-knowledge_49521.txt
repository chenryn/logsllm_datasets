User: thanks for helping me setting my cron jobs, crontab has really been a gold mine for me.
Unfortunately I have a problem, and have no idea what so ever what it might be... basically a job does not start while the neighbour jobs do. I'll explain

This is my crontabs job list:

*/10 * * * *  python /webapps/foo/manage.py fetch_articles
*/10 * * * *  python /webapps/bar/manage.py fetch_books

I wrote them as they are in a file and stored them using crontab /path/to/file .
Checked with crontab -l and the jobs are there.

The strange thing is that 1 of these executes every 10 minutes normally... but the other one does not. I tried typing in the command manually, and it works fine without a problem.

Does anyone have suggestions?
Help would be much appreciated, thanks guys.

Update:
I've been in the system log files and I found this:

Mar  5 02:50:01 localhost CRON[21652]: (root) CMD (python /webapps/foo/manage.py fetch_books)

Does this mean crontab is calling the job fine?

Thanks for your replies guys!

FIXED IT! thank you very much everyone!!
The problem was that the script silently failed, I believe it's due to the PYTHON_PATH changing due to where the script is called from... I'm entirely sure.
Assistant: From the crontab manpage:

BUGS
         Although  cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a
  newline character,
         neither the crontab command nor the cron daemon will detect this
  error. Instead,
         the  crontab  will appear to load normally. However, the command
  will never run.
         The best choice is to ensure that your crontab has a blank line at
  the end.

(my emphasis).
