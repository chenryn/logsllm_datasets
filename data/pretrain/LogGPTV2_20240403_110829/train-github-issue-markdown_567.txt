Hello. I found a memory leak in
**com.bumptech.glide.request.target.ViewTarget**.
**GlideDrawableImageViewTarget** provide a memory leak. It keeps a reference
to my activity. And GC can not release the activity.

I found this problem when run "SELECT * FROM instanceof
android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity" in MAT.
When I use  
`protected final WeakReference view;`  
in **com.bumptech.glide.request.target.ViewTarget** I resolved this problem
for me.
P.S. Sorry for my English :)
