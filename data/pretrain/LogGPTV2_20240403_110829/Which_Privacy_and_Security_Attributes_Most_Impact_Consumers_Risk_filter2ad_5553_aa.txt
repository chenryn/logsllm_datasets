Our primary research goal is to assess which previously-
identiﬁed IoT privacy and security label attributes signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence risk perception and willingness to purchase and in
what ways. Our secondary goal is to recommend improve-
ments to the proposed label design based on this assessment,
through identiﬁcation of common misconceptions that might
be corrected through alternate wording or further explanation.
To achieve our research objectives and bridge the gap
between experts’ knowledge and consumers’ understanding, we
conducted a large-scale mixed-design survey study on Amazon
Mechanical Turk with 1,371 participants. We considered two
types of smart devices and three device recipients, which led
to a total of six experimental conditions.
In our study, we tested 16 privacy and security attributes.
Out of those, 15 attributes had two possible values each, corre-
sponding to its most protective or least protective levels, while
one attribute had three possible values. For each participant, we
randomly selected and presented three of the 16 privacy and
security attributes and for each selected attribute, we randomly
selected one of its possible values. Our method effectively adds
another value to each attribute (i.e., absent), which corresponds
to the attribute not being shown to a participant.
To be speciﬁc, we presented each participant with three
randomly-selected scenarios describing a hypothetical purchase
setting for an IoT device with a label containing a single
privacy or security attribute-value pair and a brief explanation
of the attribute-value designed for consumers (see Table III
in Appendix C). We measured how each attribute-value pair
would change risk perception and willingness to purchase the
smart device when presented in isolation.
We found that attribute-value pairs indicating that collected
information could be sold or that devices lacked access control
signiﬁcantly elevated perceived risks and decreased the desire
to purchase the device. On the other hand, attribute-value pairs
indicating that no information is being shared with third parties
or retained on the cloud signiﬁcantly reduced participants’ risk
perception and increased their willingness to purchase the
device. Moreover, we found that who the device is being
purchased for does not signiﬁcantly impact participants’ risk
perception, but does impact their willingness to purchase.

Abstract—In prior work, researchers proposed an Internet of
Things (IoT) security and privacy label akin to a food nutrition
label, based on input from experts. We conducted a survey with
1,371 Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants to test the effec-
tiveness of each of the privacy and security attribute-value pairs
proposed in that prior work along two key dimensions: ability
to convey risk to consumers and impact on their willingness to
purchase an IoT device. We found that the values intended to
communicate increased risk were generally perceived that way
by participants. For example, we found that consumers perceived
more risk when a label conveyed that data would be sold to
third parties than when it would not be sold at all, and that
consumers were more willing to purchase devices when they
knew that their data would not be retained or shared with others.
However, participants’ risk perception did not always align with
their willingness to purchase, sometimes due to usability concerns.
Based on our ﬁndings, we propose actionable recommendations
on how to more effectively present privacy and security attributes
on an IoT label to better communicate risk to consumers.

I. INTRODUCTION
Consumers are concerned about IoT device data collection,
how data might be used and shared, and the lack of controls
for managing device privacy and security [1]–[4]. Research has
shown that consumers would like to use privacy and security
information when determining which device to purchase [5],
but this information is not readily available [6].
A usable IoT privacy and security label could help consumers
consider privacy and security when purchasing a device and
make more informed purchase decisions. Although there have
been several legislative proposals for IoT labels [7]–[12], few
details have been speciﬁed about what these labels should
include. To the best of our knowledge, a recent paper by
Emami-Naeini et al. [13] is the only comprehensive proposal
for an IoT privacy and security label.
After interviewing a diverse set of privacy and security
experts, Emami-Naeini et al. [13] speciﬁed 47 privacy, security,
and general attributes that should be included on a two-layer
IoT nutrition label. In addition, they conducted a small-scale
interview study with 15 IoT consumers to observe whether
participants understand the information presented on the label.
Although this work is a good ﬁrst step toward designing
effective privacy and security labels, their proposed label (see
Appendix A) was primarily based on the opinion of experts,
who often perceive risks differently than the public [14].
Our analysis shows that while an increase in participants’
perceived risk is generally aligned with a reduced willingness to
purchase and vice versa, they are not always aligned perfectly.
In particular, we found that privacy and security attributes are
more powerful in inﬂuencing consumers’ risk perception than

C. Labels
We make the following contributions in this paper:
• Through our quantitative data collection, we identify
the privacy and security attributes and corresponding
values that most impact participants’ risk perception and
willingness to purchase IoT devices.
• Through our qualitative data collection, we gain insights
into why participants were inﬂuenced or not inﬂuenced
by label attributes to perceive a device as riskier or less
risky, or to report being more likely or less willing to
purchase that device.
• We distill a set of actionable recommendations on how to
better inform consumers’ purchase behavior by more effec-
tively conveying privacy and security risks to consumers
on an IoT label.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
We provide background on risk perception. We then discuss
factors impacting consumers’ willingness to purchase. Finally,
we discuss research on how labels have been used to inform
consumers’ purchase behavior.
A. Risk Perception
Perceived risk is a subjective assessment of the likelihood
of a speciﬁc event happening and concern about its conse-
quences [15]. Research has shown that people tend to base
their decisions on the perceived risk [16], [17].
In the context of privacy and security, researchers have
shown that users’ lack of risk awareness and knowledge about
how their data might be used [18]–[21] inﬂuences their risk
judgement [22], [23]. Skirpan et al. found identity theft, account
breach, and job loss as the top-three rated risk scenarios related
to emerging technologies [24].
Researchers have examined how people perceive risks of
smart devices. Wieneke et al. conducted a qualitative study
on how privacy affects decision making related to wearable
