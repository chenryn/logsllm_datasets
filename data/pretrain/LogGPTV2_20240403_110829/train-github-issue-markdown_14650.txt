this would expand upon _load_enums() in postgresql/base.py, so that any kind
of custom type is recognized during reflection. We'd likely have to create
some kind of "ad-hoc" type that is declared like this:
    from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import TYPE
    Column("mycolumn", TYPE("MY_CUSTOM_TYPE"))
