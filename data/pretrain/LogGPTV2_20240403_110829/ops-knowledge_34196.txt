Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system receiving and allocating blocks of data. The DataNode component is receiving blocks from various sources and the FSNamesystem component is allocating the blocks to the appropriate locations. Additionally, the PacketResponder component is terminating the blocks when they are no longer needed.
