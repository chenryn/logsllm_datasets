### Problem description
The UI jitters time to time, mostly when the drawer pops out/off for the first
time. Even the home page www.material-ui.com has this problem when
opening/closing the drawer by clicking the 3-lines icon at top-left corner.
It happens more often on Chromium:  
Version 55.0.2883.87 Built on Ubuntu , running on Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit).  
It also happens on Opera (43.0.2442.806) although not so frequently as
Chromium.  
It never happens on Firefox (51.0.1 (64-bit)).
