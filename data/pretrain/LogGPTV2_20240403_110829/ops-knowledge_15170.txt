User: Please explain the concept and advantages of virtualization technology, and provide a practical application scenario.
Assistant: Virtualization technology refers to creating multiple virtual environments on a physical computer, and each virtual environment is like an independent computer. These virtual environments can run different operating systems, applications and services, but only share raw computing resources. The advantages of virtualization technology include: 1. Higher utilization rate: With virtualization technology, multiple virtual machines can run on the same physical server, thereby improving the utilization rate of computing resources and reducing hardware costs. 2. Better elasticity and flexibility: Virtualization technology can quickly create, delete or move virtual machines, thereby improving the portability and flexibility of applications so that they can be adjusted faster when requirements change. 3. Higher security: Virtualization technology can isolate different virtual machines and provide better security and privacy protection. A practical application scenario is the cloud computing platform. Cloud computing service providers can use virtualization technology to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical server to host applications and data for multiple users. This approach enables more efficient use of hardware resources, improves scalability and elasticity, and makes it easier for users to scale applications or add new services.
