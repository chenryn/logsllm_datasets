The preview iframe, located to the right of the code window, is displaying duplicate code.

Upon inspecting the source code for the iframe, I confirmed that the code is indeed duplicated twice. This issue appears in many, if not all, of the challenges I have attempted so far. Refreshing the screen sometimes temporarily resolves the problem, but the duplication reoccurs when I proceed to the next challenge.

I am using Firefox 41.0.1 on Linux Mint 17.
