The preview iframe on the right of the code window shows duplicate code.

When I checked the source code for the iframe, I did see the code duplicated
twice as well.  
This occurs on many, if not all challenges that I have taken so far. A refresh
of the screen seems to temporarily resolve the issue at times, until I go to
the next challenge. At which time, the code duplicates again.
