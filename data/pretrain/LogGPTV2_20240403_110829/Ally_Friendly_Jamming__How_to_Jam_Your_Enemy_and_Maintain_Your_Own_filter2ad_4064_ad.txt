The BER for other modulation methods can be derived
similarly. Again assuming that the SNR is high enough,
SN R can be ignored, we can get the BER as shown in
Figure 10 (a), in which the line for x = 0% shows the
expected BER for an unauthorized device when BPSK is
used for modulation. It is easy to see that when the jamming
signal is 10dB stronger than the power of a transmission,
the BER of the unauthorized device is close to 50%, a value
obtainable with random guesses, and their communication
is disabled.
2) DSSS-based Unauthorized Devices: To jam DSSS-
based unauthorized devices, the ally jammer needs to act as
a broadband jammer [31] by increasing its symbol rate and
injecting jamming signals with a bandwidth approximately
the same as the DSSS signals from unauthorized devices.
Assuming the spreading code length of unauthorized devices
is Gp and BPSK is used for modulation, according to [31],
we can estimate the BER of a DSSS-based unauthorized
device under ally jamming as

Figure 10 (b) shows the BER when SNR= −10dB. It
indicates that to disrupt the reception at an unauthorized
receiver, the jamming signal must overcome the processing
gain of spreading in DSSS. The result is consistent with the
situation when ally friendly jamming is not used.
3) FHSS-based Unauthorized Devices: To jam FHSS-
based unauthorized devices, the ally jammer needs to use
broadband jamming to make sure the jamming signals are
strong enough on all hopping channels. Assuming a fast
hopping system, the probability that the unauthorized device

fails to receive the transmission in one hop is Pek

Figure 10 (c) illustrates the jamming performance against
FHSS-based unauthorized devices. It is clear that when the
JSR increases, the BER of FHSS-based unauthorized devices
reaches 50% quickly and the communication is disabled.
C. JSR Trade-off
Maintaining authorized communication and disabling
unauthorized communication have different requirements for
JSR. JSR needs to be large to obtain effective jamming
against unauthorized communication, but at the same time,
JSR cannot be too large to affect authorized communication.
Assuming that the BER of authorized devices should be at
, and the BER of unauthorized devices should
most P a,u
to disable their communication. Based
be at
on the earlier analysis, we can conclude that in order to
maintain authorized communication and disable ordinary
unauthorized devices, the JSR should be in the following

For unauthorized devices using DSSS or FHSS, the jam-
ming performance also depends on their processing gains
besides JSR. When the processing gain is high enough,
the ally jammer may not ﬁnd a usable JSR to both allow
authorized communication and disable unauthorized ones.
However, authorized devices can also use anti-jamming
techniques such as DSSS and FHSS. As a result, the JSR
upper bound derived earlier can be signiﬁcantly increased to
allow effective jamming of unauthorized devices with anti-
jamming capabilities.

D. Limitations
Ally friendly jamming provides us a desirable capability:
disabling unauthorized wireless communication while still
maintaining authorized wireless communication. This paper
may be viewed as the ﬁrst step toward this goal. Several
problems remain open for future works.
Fast Identiﬁcation of Ally Jammers: Ally friendly
jamming uses pilot frequencies for fast
identiﬁcation of
ally jammers, which may introduce potential vulnerabilities.
The attacker can inject or replay pilot frequency signals to
mislead the authorized receiver’s synchronization process.
Therefore, a more robust fast identiﬁcation approach de-
serves further investigations.
Fast Synchronization: Shifting correlation based syn-
chronization used by the authorized receiver is expensive
in computation, and may have scalability issues, especially
when the sample size and/or the number of ally jammers are
large. Thus, a more computational efﬁcient synchronization
approach is desirable.
Ally Friendly Jamming with MIMO Devices: To make
ally friendly jamming suitable for MIMO devices, we need
to consider authorized/unauthorized MIMO devices (e.g.,
TX, RX) and MIMO ally jammers. One possible way of
extending the current approach to the MIMO ally jammer
case is: using a different key to generate jamming signals
on each of the transmit paths of a MIMO ally jammer,
and let the authorized receiver treat the MIMO ally jammer
as multiple ally jammers. More studies are required for
authorized/unauthorized MIMO devices cases.
Handing Adversarial Jamming: Authorized devices can
use the anti-jamming techniques (e.g., DSSS and FHSS)
to suppress the adversarial jamming signals after removing
the ally jamming signals, which calls for efforts on the
integration of ally friendly jamming and the anti-jamming
techniques.
VI. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
We have implemented an “off-line processing” based
prototype based on GNURadio and USRP. In the following
of this section, we will give the implementation details and
the corresponding evaluation results.
A. Experiment Setup
The prototype system consists of two ally jammers AJ1
and AJ2, a transmitter, and a receiver. Each of them is imple-
mented by a USRP N210 board connected to a laptop. Each
USRP N210 uses a XCVR2450 daughter board operating in
the 2.4GHz range as the RF front end. The receiver acts as
an authorized device by using the techniques in ally friendly
jamming to synchronize and remove the ally jamming sig-
nals, and as an unauthorized device by directly demodulating
the received signals. Our prototype implementation uses
both GNURadio and MATLAB for signal processing. The
USRP N210 uses a 2.5 PPM [3] temperature-compensated
184
crystal oscillator (TCXO) as its frequency reference [4], the
frequency drift is within [−6KHz, +6KHz] (2.4GHz ·2.5
PPM= 6KHz). Therefore, the maximum frequency offset
fmax = 12KHz, and the pilot frequencies for AJ1 and AJ2
are 12KHz and 36KHz, respectively.
The experiments contain three steps as described below.
First, we use a PRNG with two different keys to generate
the random ﬂoating point numbers with precision of 0.1
and uniformly distributed within [−1, 1], which are then
used to form the ally jamming symbols for AJ1 and AJ2
respectively.
Second, we keep the transmitter silent, turn on the receiver
and let two ally jammers emit the ally jamming symbols
simultaneously with the same transmit power. Ally jammers
are about 2 meters away from the receiver. The ally jammer’s
symbol rate is 5×105 sps (symbols per second). The receiver
samples the channel at 106 sps and dumps the received
samples in a ﬁle for the subsequent off-line processing. The
samples collected in this step will be referred to as the TX
Off Samples.
Third, we start the transmitter, which uses DBPSK mod-
ulation and sends packets with the length of 1, 500 bytes
at a data rate of 500kb/s. The interval between packets
is 15ms. Ally jammers and the transmitter are about 2
meters away from the receiver and they all use the default
transmit power with the same transmit gain. Ally jammers
are still jamming the channel and the receiver still records
the received samples in a ﬁle. The collected samples are
termed as the TX On Samples.
B. Evaluation Methodology
The experimental evaluation consists of two parts: micro-
evaluation and macro-evaluation. In micro-evaluation, we
evaluate the performance of critical techniques used in ally
friendly jamming. In macro-evaluation, we compare the
bit error rates and packet
loss rates for authorized and
unauthorized devices under ally friendly jamming, including
the case where unauthorized devices use DSSS for anti-
jamming communication.
C. Micro-Evaluation
1) Synchronization: The authorized receiver does spec-
trum analysis on the TX Off Samples using FFT. Figure 11
shows the result on frequency domain when 10000 samples
is used for FFT, from which we can clearly see that
there is a spike at 7.9KHz, and another one at 32.7KHz.
As 7.9KHz is within [0, 24KHz) and 32.7KHz is within
[24KHz, 48kHz), the authorized receiver knows that AJ1
and AJ2 are jamming the channel.
After identifying ally jammers, the authorized receiver
computes their frequency offsets, compensates for the fre-
quency offsets on the locally generated symbols and cor-
relates with the received jamming signals to synchronize
with both AJ1 and AJ2. As shown in Figure 12, there is a

Synchronizing with multiple ally jammers. The correlation
correlation peak for AJ1 at position 3190, which means that
the timing offset between AJ1 and the authorized receiver is
3190· Tp, where Tp is the sampling interval. The authorized
receiver can use this offset to synchronize with the ally
jammer AJ1. Similarly, there is another correlation peak for
AJ2 at position 22459. The authorized receiver can use the
same process to synchronize with AJ2.
We repeat
this experiment 1,000 times with different
samples. By using the correlation peak position as the
indicator of timing offset, the success rate of synchronization
is 100%. We also measure the time required for initial
synchronization. It takes about 3 seconds for correlating
106 samples with a correlation length of 103 samples. After
the initial synchronization, the re-synchronization takes less
than 1 ms. Note that
timing experiments are conducted
on a laptop with an i7-2760QM CPU. The required time
will be shorter on a dedicated radio chip. All of these
experiments demonstrate that the authorized receiver can
accurately synchronize with ally jammers.
2) Detecting Transmissions under Ally Jamming: In this
experiment, we examine how well the authorized transmis-
sion can be detected under ally jamming by using the TX
On Samples. Since the packet length is 1500 bytes and the
rate is 500kb/s, the packet transmission time is 24 ms. We
set the re-synchronization interval as 10 ms. We adjust the
transmit and receive gains such that the JSR is 5dB, 10dB,
and 15dB, respectively, which are in the JSR trade-off range
shown in Section V-C. Then we examine the true positive
and false positive rates of transmission detection for different
thresholds on the standard deviation of the estimated channel
coefﬁcients. Figure 13 shows the result of the experiment. It
is easy to see that there is a range of threshold values that
allow the transmissions to be detected almost 100% with
close-to-0 false positive rate. In other words, the detection
of transmissions under ally jamming can be performed very
precisely.

3) Removal of Ally Jamming Signals: We want to know
how well the authorized device can estimate and remove
ally jamming signals when only ally jamming signals are
received. We use the TX Off Samples collected when one and
two ally jammers are on, respectively. After synchronization,
we use the ﬁrst 1000 samples to estimate the channel(s),
