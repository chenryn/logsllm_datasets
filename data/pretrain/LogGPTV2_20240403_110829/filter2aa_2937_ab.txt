### Paging and Virtual Memory

#### Overview
Paging and virtual memory are essential concepts in modern operating systems, enabling efficient memory management and protection. The following sections provide a detailed explanation of these concepts, including the structure of page tables, translation lookaside buffers (TLBs), and the PaX PAGEEXEC security mechanism.

#### Page Tables and Directories
- **Page Directory**: Contains 1024 entries, each pointing to a page table.
- **Page Table**: Each page table contains 1024 entries, each representing a 4096-byte page in physical memory.
- **CR3 Register**: Stores the base address of the page directory.
- **Page Directory Entry (PDE)**: Points to a page table.
- **Page Table Entry (PTE)**: Points to a physical page frame.

#### Example Binary Values
- `11011110101011011011111011101111`
- `1101111010` (890)
- `1011011011` (731)
- `111011101111` (3823)

#### TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)
The TLB is a hardware cache that stores recent translations from virtual to physical addresses, significantly speeding up memory access.

- **Instruction TLB**: Caches virtual to physical address translations for instructions.
- **Data TLB**: Caches virtual to physical address translations for data.

#### Page Table Entries
Each PTE is 32 bits and includes:
- **Physical Address of Next Level**: The base address of the next level page table or the physical page frame.
- **Read/Write Permission**: Indicates whether the page can be read, written, or both.
- **User/Supervisor Access**: Determines if the page is accessible by user-level or supervisor-level processes.

#### PaX PAGEEXEC
PaX PAGEEXEC is a security feature that emulates non-executable pages, enhancing system security by preventing code execution in certain regions of memory.

- **User/Supervisor Emulation**: Ensures that only authorized processes can execute code.
- **Non-Executable Pages**: Marks certain pages as non-executable to prevent code injection attacks.

#### PaX Page Fault Strategy
When a page fault occurs, the PaX PAGEEXEC strategy is as follows:
- If the faulting page is a supervisor page and the instruction pointer (IP) is on the faulting page, the process is terminated.
- Otherwise, the user page is set in the PTE, the Data TLB is primed, and the supervisor page is set in the PTE.

#### Page Level Permissions
- **User**: Read, Write, Execute
- **Supervisor**: Read, Write, Execute
- **PaX/NX**: Non-Executable
- **Not-Writable**: Read, Execute
- **Writable**: Read, Write, Execute

#### Code Reuse
- **Return to libc (1997)**: A technique used in exploit development to bypass non-executable stack protections by redirecting the flow of control to existing library functions.

This structured overview provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of paging, virtual memory, and related security mechanisms.
