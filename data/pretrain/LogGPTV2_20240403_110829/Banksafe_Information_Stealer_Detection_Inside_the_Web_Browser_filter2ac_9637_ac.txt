### 2. Start Virtual Machine (VM)
3. Execute malware to infect the system (wait 2 seconds)
4. Launch Internet Explorer
5. Analyze Internet Explorer for hooks until hooks are detected or a timeout occurs

**Determining an Appropriate Timeout:**
Selecting an appropriate timeout is challenging and closely related to the halting problem. Simply observing a program does not provide certainty about whether it will inject itself into a browser. When monitoring a falsely classified sample, it may never modify the browser. Many malware specimens are known to wait for a specific period before initiating malicious activities. For instance, Zeus often exhibits this behavior. Preliminary tests revealed that 96% of the samples became active within the first 110 seconds, while only 41% injected the Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) component within the first 30 seconds. Consequently, a timeout of 130 seconds was chosen for the final evaluation.

### Sample Pool
- **Zeus Samples:** A set of 881 Zeus samples was obtained from the Zeus-tracker.
- **SpyEye Samples:** An additional 164 SpyEye samples were sourced from the SpyEye-Tracker.
- Each sample was executed, and any that crashed were discarded. Malware without detected browser hooks was manually verified for crashes.

**Reasons for Crashed Malware Samples:**
- Incomplete downloads during infection can result in broken samples.
- Some variants bind themselves to the first system they infect and crash on subsequent systems, evading analysis in sandboxes.
- Other malware detects and crashes in a virtual environment.

- **Crash Rates:**
  - Out of 881 Zeus samples, 75 crashed.
  - Out of 164 SpyEye samples, only 4 crashed.

### Results for Zeus
- After removing all crashed samples, 12 different hooking fingerprints were identified among the remaining 806 samples.
- The distribution of these fingerprints, including timeouts and crashed samples, is illustrated in Figure 1.
- More than 75% (607) of the samples had unique fingerprints, including Zeus versions 1 and 2, indicating that browser hooking is not the primary reason for version changes.
- The second largest group, 12.4% (100), consisted of older Zeus versions.
- The remaining groups, with between 1 and 20 samples each, were manually investigated.
  - A group of 20 samples was identified as a component of Fake AV software called Kingsoft Antivirus, which uses MitB techniques to steal user information.
  - Three groups of two samples each were found to belong to the SpyEye family.
  - Six remaining groups contained custom variants of Zeus, confirming the existence of enhanced functionality in customized versions.
- In total, 8 distinct Zeus hooking fingerprints were discovered, with more than 96% of the Zeus samples having one of the two most common fingerprints, demonstrating reliable detection and minor variations from standard hook fingerprints.

### Verification of Zeus Samples
- To ensure the infections were indeed Zeus, a verification using known unique system modifications for Zeus was performed.
- No false positives were encountered in the Zeus sample set.

### Results for SpyEye
- Out of 164 SpyEye samples, only 4 crashed. The low crash rate compared to Zeus may be due to the absence of machine binding in SpyEye.
- 23 samples timed out without performing any system modifications, possibly due to a 130-second timeout being too short or the samples detecting the tools and virtual machine.
- The remaining 137 samples were divided into 13 groups with different fingerprints, as shown in Figure 2.
- The largest group comprised more than 30% of the samples, and the top three fingerprints were found in 80% of the samples.
- The remaining groups had one to seven samples, with four fingerprints unique to one sample each.
- The number of fingerprints reflects the ongoing development of the SpyEye construction kit, which is newer and under heavier development compared to the established Zeus.

### Comparison to Behavior Blockers
- To compare our proposed detection method to common proactive detection solutions, eight popular AV security suites were installed on VirtualBox instances of Microsoft Windows XP SP2:
  - Panda Internet Security 2011
  - Avast Internet Security 5
  - Norton Internet Security 2011
  - G Data Internet Security 2011
  - F-Secure Internet Security 2011
  - McAfee Internet Security
  - Kaspersky Internet Security 2011
  - TrendMicro Internet Security 2011
- Over two weeks, new in-the-wild samples provided by Zeus- and Spyeye-Tracker, with zero signature detection rates by the aforementioned products, were used to evaluate the proactive detection capabilities.
- All trojan samples were manually executed first with the security solution installed and then in reverse order to test retrospective detection.
- None of the eight solutions could detect any Zeus or SpyEye samples that had already infected the system.
- With the security suite already installed, only one product detected the Zeus installation process, while two prevented SpyEye infections proactively.
- Another security suite detected Zeus infections but did not effectively prevent them.
- All samples were successfully detected by Banksafe, achieving perfect classification in this smaller experiment.

### Detection of Other Information Stealers
- While Zeus and SpyEye were the most prevalent information stealers, other popular information-stealing crimeware, such as Patcher, Carberp, Silentbanker, Bebloh, Gozi, and Katusha, were also tested.
- The samples were identified by searching for their names in the VirusTotal database and matching them with AV signature names, then manually verified using known features.
- All trojans, except Katusha, which uses a malicious browser plugin, hooked API functions inside the web browser for form-grabbing and were reliably detected by Banksafe.
- Table 1 provides an overview of the evaluation results for all sample sets tested against Banksafe.
