Figure 4: Estimation accuracy. 
One  application  of  QoS  class  specific  traffic  matrices  is  QoS 
dependent routing - especially if the structure of the QoS traffic 
matrices  differs  from  class  to  class.  The  estimation  result  is 
useful  only,  if  the  structures  are  identified  accurately  by  the 
estimation  method.  The  following  accuracy  test  analyzes  this 
problem. We assume two different QoS classes. Class 1 traffic 
originates at nodes 1 to 12, class 2 traffic originates at nodes 13 
to 26. Each source sends 100000 traffic units to each other node 
of our network. Nodes 1 to 12 and nodes 13 to 26 respectively 
are  not  in  a  close  topological  region.  The  nodes  are  sorted  by 
name alphabetically and numbered from 1 to 26. The estimation 
result  for  the  QoS  class  specific  traffic  matrices  is  shown  in 
Figure  5  and  Figure  6.  The  matrix  elements  are  colored  as 
follows:  green:  less  than  1000  traffic  units,  yellow:  between 
1000 and 50000 traffic units, red: more than 50000 traffic units. 
Therefore, a perfect match is achieved, if the first 12 rows of the 
QoS 1 matrix are red and the others are green and vice versa for 
QoS2. The structures of the QoS traffic matrices are accurately 
identified in the estimation.  
The mean relative error E is 14.6 % for QoS class 1 and 11.2 % 
for class 2. If we calculate the Eα, only the positive elements of 
the  traffic  matrices  are  considered.  In  that  case,  the  mean 
relative error Eα is 6.3 % for class 1 and 5.3 % for class 2.

3.3  Estimation results with real network 
data 
In the following section the QoS class specific traffic matrix 
estimation (TGQ) is applied to data from our backbone 
network. The total traffic matrix is calculated by means of 
the LDP method. In the considered network topology only 
12 of the 26 backbone routers could measure the link 
utilization statistics per QoS class. Therefore, we expect 
more accurate results when all the routers are upgraded to 
an OS version that allows measurements per QoS class. First 
we show the relation of the amount of traffic between the 
four QoS classes ( 
Figure  7).  Obviously,  the  total  traffic  volume  is  dominated  by 
the  best  effort  traffic  (QoS4)  and  the  structure  of  the  QoS4 
matrix  agrees  with  the  structure  of  the  total  traffic  matrix 
(Figure 8). The structures of the QoS1, QoS2 and QoS3 traffic 
matrices are different to the structure of the total traffic matrix. 
This is mainly caused by specific application architectures (e.g. 
position  of  voice  gateway  routers),  or  locations  of  specific 
customers  with  relatively  high  QoS  demands.  From  the  QoS1 
traffic matrix in Figure 9 (voice traffic), we can see that a lot of 
traffic  is  destined  to  node  1  and  node  2,  the  location  of  voice 
gateways. Main sources are the nodes 7 to node 14.

4.  CONCLUSION 
We  have  presented a new model and numerical results from a 
real world network for QoS class specific traffic matrices. We 
demonstrated  that  this  method  can  significantly  improve  the 
estimation quality. The numerical results show the differences in 
the  demand  structure  for  different  QoS  classes.  Thereby  we 
motivate why the availability of good quality QoS class specific 
traffic matrices is important for efficient network planning and 
traffic engineering. 
The  absolute  size  of  the  estimation  errors  is  still  quite  high 
for  the  intended  use of the QoS class specific traffic matrices. 
On the other hand a good estimation of the demand structure of 
the traffic matrices could already be achieved and the need for 
QoS  class  specific  traffic  matrices  will  only  grow  with  the 
traffic growth in non-best-effort traffic classes.  
Figure  7  shows  that  there  is  still  some  time  to  improve  the 
estimation quality. 
Future improvements of our method include the usage of state-
of-the-art  methods  from  numerical  linear  algebra  (e.g.  sparse 
matrix SVD). This would allow us to investigate larger network 
topologies. Furthermore, we aim to incorporate a larger number 
of  QoS  class  specific  link  utilizations  –  not  only  from  links 
within the backbone network but also from ingress links into the 
network - to improve the estimation quality.
