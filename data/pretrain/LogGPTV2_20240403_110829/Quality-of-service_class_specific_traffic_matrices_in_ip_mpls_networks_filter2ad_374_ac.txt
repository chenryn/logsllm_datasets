### 3.2 Estimation Convergence and Accuracy

**Figure 3: Estimation Convergence**

The convergence of the estimation process is depicted in Figure 3, which shows the number of iterations on the x-axis and the error on the y-axis.

**Figure 4: Estimation Accuracy**

The accuracy of the estimation is illustrated in Figure 4, where the mean relative error (MRE) is plotted against the parameter \(\alpha\).

### 3.3 Application to QoS Class-Specific Traffic Matrices

QoS class-specific traffic matrices are particularly useful for QoS-dependent routing, especially when the structure of the QoS traffic matrices varies between different classes. The estimation result is valuable only if the structures are accurately identified by the estimation method. The following accuracy test examines this problem.

We consider two different QoS classes:
- **Class 1**: Traffic originates from nodes 1 to 12.
- **Class 2**: Traffic originates from nodes 13 to 26.

Each source sends 100,000 traffic units to each other node in the network. Nodes 1 to 12 and nodes 13 to 26 are not located in close topological regions. The nodes are sorted alphabetically and numbered from 1 to 26.

**Figure 5: Estimation of QoS 1 Traffic**
- Matrix elements are colored as follows:
  - Green: less than 1000 traffic units
  - Yellow: between 1000 and 50,000 traffic units
  - Red: more than 50,000 traffic units

A perfect match is achieved if the first 12 rows of the QoS 1 matrix are red and the others are green, and vice versa for QoS 2.

**Figure 6: Estimation of QoS 2 Traffic**
- Similar color coding as in Figure 5.

The structures of the QoS traffic matrices are accurately identified in the estimation. The mean relative error (MRE) is 14.6% for QoS class 1 and 11.2% for class 2. When considering only the positive elements of the traffic matrices, the MRE (\(E_\alpha\)) is 6.3% for class 1 and 5.3% for class 2.

### 3.4 Estimation Results with Real Network Data

In this section, we apply the QoS class-specific traffic matrix estimation (TGQ) to data from our backbone network. The total traffic matrix is calculated using the LDP method. In the considered network topology, only 12 of the 26 backbone routers can measure link utilization statistics per QoS class. We expect more accurate results once all routers are upgraded to an OS version that allows such measurements.

**Figure 7: Distribution over QoS Classes**
- The total traffic volume is dominated by best-effort traffic (QoS4), and the structure of the QoS4 matrix aligns with the structure of the total traffic matrix (Figure 8).
- The structures of the QoS1, QoS2, and QoS3 traffic matrices differ from the total traffic matrix, primarily due to specific application architectures (e.g., voice gateway routers) or locations of customers with high QoS demands.

**Figure 8: Overall Traffic Matrix**
- Shows the overall traffic distribution across the network.

**Figure 9: QoS 1 Traffic Matrix**
- Indicates that a significant amount of traffic is destined for nodes 1 and 2, the locations of voice gateways. Main sources are nodes 7 to 14.

### 4. Conclusion

We have presented a new model and numerical results from a real-world network for QoS class-specific traffic matrices. This method significantly improves the estimation quality, and the numerical results highlight the differences in demand structure for different QoS classes. The availability of high-quality QoS class-specific traffic matrices is crucial for efficient network planning and traffic engineering.

While the absolute size of the estimation errors is still relatively high for the intended use, a good estimation of the demand structure has been achieved. The need for QoS class-specific traffic matrices will grow with the increasing traffic in non-best-effort classes.

Future improvements include the use of state-of-the-art methods from numerical linear algebra (e.g., sparse matrix SVD) to investigate larger network topologies. Additionally, we aim to incorporate a larger number of QoS class-specific link utilizations, not only from links within the backbone network but also from ingress links into the network, to further enhance the estimation quality.
