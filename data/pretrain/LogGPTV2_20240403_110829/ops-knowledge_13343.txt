What exactly does this mean? Is my SSL key bad?  If so, what is the correct way to upload the key to the server?  I just opened the crt file in notepad and copied the data out and saved it over ssh.

Assistant: Check 

SSLCertificateFile and 

SSLCertificateKeyFile 

in /etc/http/conf/httpd.conf are both pointing at the correct files.

Check that the SSLCertificateKeyFile is a key with ownership set to root:root and permissions set to 400.

Sounds like you have the .crt in place but not the .key.

See the Apache SSL FAQ for more details.
