User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 complex_boolean_expression 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks for a specific issue in SQL queries that can lead to poor performance. The issue occurs when the "in" clause in a query is too long, which can cause the query to execute slowly. The function looks for instances of this issue in the SQL query and if it finds one where the length of the "in" clause exceeds a certain threshold, it returns a message indicating the issue and provides a suggestion for how to fix it. If the function does not find any instances of this issue, it is not a root cause of the performance problem.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- slow_sql_instance.query
- expression_number
- len(expression)
- monitoring.get_slow_sql_param('large_in_list_threshold')
