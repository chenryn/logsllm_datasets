### Data Set: Historical Website Snapshots

For this analysis, we utilize two primary data sets:

1. **Weekly Crawls (2018-Present):** 
   - We conduct weekly crawls of all domains listed in DNS zone files since 2018. Each crawl captures the first 256K bytes of the landing page, excluding embedded objects such as images.
   - This method provides HTML snapshots for 57 domains, representing approximately 5% of the total.

2. **Web Archive (2013-2019):**
   - Using the Web Archive API, we retrieve one snapshot per domain from the period between 2013 and 2019.
   - This process yields historical snapshots for 428 domains, or about 37% of the total.
   - The intersection of these two data sets results in a combined payload for 468 domains.

### Website Classification

We employed the OpenDNS domain classification scheme [10] to manually classify each domain using two classifications per domain. Some domains did not fit into any of the predefined categories, so we introduced a "No Category" class. Our findings indicate that 94% of the web pages fall into the top six categories, as shown in Table 2.

#### Main Classes of Pages:
- **Parked Domains/No Category:** Domains with no content or errors.
- **Blogs:** Websites with auto-generated content designed to attract traffic.
- **Ecommerce/Shopping and Drugs:** Sites selling narcotics, drugs, or counterfeit products.

| Category                | Number of Pages |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Blogs                   | 152             |
| Parked Domains          | 112             |
| No Category             | 77              |
| Ecommerce/Shopping      | 37              |
| Drugs                   | 33              |
| Business Services       | 31              |
| Other                   | 26              |

### Traffic Perspective

Next, we examine the Internet traffic flows associated with CyberBunker, observed from a tier-1 ISP and a large IXP. By comparing and combining these perspectives, we aim to identify specific features that characterize these types of BPHs (Bulletproof Hosting).

#### 4.1 Data Set

We combine data from two vantage points:
- **Tier-1 ISP**
- **Large IXP**

The traffic flow samples are anonymized and do not contain any payload information. The datasets cover a 6-week period from June 17, 2019, to July 29, 2019, when CyberBunker was still active. The combined volume of transferred data during this period is 18.9 TBytes, corresponding to an average traffic rate of 4.5 Mbps.

#### Complementary Views

Comparing the ISP and IXP datasets, we observe:
- **Geography:** Two largely separate views in terms of traffic geography.
- **Communication Patterns:** Similarities in communication patterns, with a slight overweight of outgoing traffic (68%).

We compiled a top 100 list of source and destination networks for both vantage points and found almost no intersection, highlighting the complementary nature of the datasets. Both vantage points show similar patterns in the number of source and destination networks for certain protocols. Notably, there is a high number of networks that are destinations for outgoing TCP connections from CyberBunker, suggesting scanning activity.

#### 4.2 Application Mix

To understand the hosted Internet applications, we analyzed the port mix of UDP and TCP traffic flows. Each vantage point provided a unique port mix, so we compiled the intersection of the top 100 ports from both perspectives. Common and popular Internet applications related to CyberBunker include:
- **TCP Ports:** 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH)
- **UDP Ports:** 53 (DNS), 1194 (OpenVPN)

Port 22 (SSH) was particularly prevalent, even more frequent than HTTPS. Further investigation revealed that the CyberBunker network was used to scan for SSH vulnerabilities on customer edge routers, targeting over 88,000 /24 networks.

#### 4.3 Traffic Characteristics

We identified unusual traffic patterns, especially those indicative of a C&C (Command and Control) infrastructure. Focusing on HTTP and HTTPS traffic, we observed an atypical distribution of packet sizes. Typically, HTTP and HTTPS communication involves small initial packets (around 64 Bytes) and larger packets (1300 to 1522 Bytes). In the case of CyberBunker, we noticed a large number of packets between 200 and 300 Bytes. Comparing this to other major hosting providers (Figure 2) confirmed the unusual nature of the traffic pattern. Further investigation revealed that around 400 /24 networks were potentially contacted by malware or bots.

### Conclusion and Next Steps

In this study, we analyzed the CyberBunker BPH from both domain and traffic perspectives. Unlike other BPHs, CyberBunker could not be identified by upstream re-wiring in BGP, making it an interesting case. From the domain perspective, we found that web pages hosted by CyberBunker differ significantly from typical legitimate web pages. Additionally, the CyberBunker showed signs of organized web hosting, with a few IPs hosting the majority of domains. The traffic perspective revealed clear deviations from expected patterns of major hosting providers and corresponded with the indictment and post-mortem analysis.

Our analysis raises the following questions:
- Can the identified content of hosted websites and the discovered traffic patterns be used to identify other BPHs?
- Is the CyberBunker an individual case, or are there broader implications?
