can be used and we have to rely on archived versions.
Data set: historic web site snapshots. We base this analysis on
two data sets. First, our own weekly crawls of all domains in DNS
zone files since 2018, which contain the first 256K bytes of the
landing page (without embedded objects such as images). This way,
we obtain HTML snapshots for 57 domains (5%). Second, we obtain
snapshots from the Web Archive (web.archive.org). Using the
Web Archive API, we fetch one snapshot per domain in the period
of 2013 to 2019. This way, we obtain historic snapshots for 428
domains (37%). The intersection results to payload for 468 domains.
Web site classification. We used the OpenDNS domain classifi-
cation scheme [10] to perform a manual content classification of
every domain by using 2 classifications per domain. Some domains
are not classifiable to any of the given categories. Therefore we
extend the OpenDNS domain classification scheme with a “No Cat-
egory”-class. We find that 94% of the web pages are represented
by the top-6 categories, which are shown in Table 2. We identified
three main classes of pages: i) domains that show no content or
errors (Parked Domains; No Category) ii) blogs with auto generated
content to attract traffic (Blogs), and iii) shops selling narcotics,
drugs, or replica/fake products (Drugs; Ecommerce/Shopping).

4 TRAFFIC PERSPECTIVE
Next, we study CyberBunker Internet traffic flows observed from a
tier-1 ISP and a large IXP. We compare and combine these perspec-
tives to study traffic flows, protocols, and application ports to find
specific features that help to characterize these types of BPHs.
4.1 Data Set
We combine two vantage points: i) a tier-1 ISP and ii) a large IXP
from which we obtain traffic flows samples of the the CyberBunker
IP space (see Table 1). The traffic flow samples do not contain any
payload information and are anonymized to the extent that they
cannot be attributed to individual endpoints or users. The two
dataset span a period of 6 weeks from 2019-06-17 to 2019-07-29,
when the CyberBunker was still active. Combining both yields a
volume of 18.9 TByte of transferred data in this 6-week period,
which corresponds to an average traffic rate of 4.5 Mbps.
Complementary views. When comparing the ISP and the IXP data
set, we find two largely separate views in terms of traffic geography,
but also similarities in communication patterns. Incoming and out-
going traffic rates of the CyberBunker network, as seen from both

traffic of 68%. We compute a top 100 list of the source and desti-
nation networks for the IXP and ISP and find that there is almost
no intersection. This might come without surprise, but underlines
the complementary view of the two datasets. Both vantage points
present similar patterns when comparing the number of source
and destination networks for certain protocols. Most noticeable,
we find a very large number of networks that are the destination
of outgoing TCP connections from the CyberBunker, compared to
source networks that communicated into the CyberBunker. This
pattern most likely points to scanning activity outgoing from the
CyberBunker that can be seen by both vantage points, ISP and IXP.
4.2 Application Mix
To understand the hosted Internet applications, we study the port
mix of UDP and TCP traffic flows. First, we notice that each vantage
point renders an individual port mix, when building a top list of
ports sorted by flows and bytes. Therefore, we compile the inter-
section of the top 100 ports from both perspectives, resulting in
a clear representation of the most common and popular Internet
applications related to the CyberBunker.
As in typical Internet traffic, port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
for the TCP protocol and 53 (DNS) and 1194 (OpenVPN) for UDP
are among the top 5 application ports used. Extending this list to the
top 10 reveals numerous application ports used for administering
servers e.g. backup applications, remote desktop applications, and
ports used for TOR and BitTorrent. Most notably, we find port
22/TCP (SSH) to be one of the most prevalent application ports, even
more frequent than HTTPS. We continue our efforts to understand
the anomaly of port 22 (SSH) and find that the network of the
CyberBunker was used to scan for a vulnerability with SSH on
customer edge routers towards an equivalent of more than 88,000
/24 networks. This explains our previous observed similarity in
the communication pattern of outgoing TCP connections from the
CyberBunker that we observed at both the IXP and ISP.
4.3 Traffic Characteristics
We continue to find evidence of unusual traffic patterns, especially
for indications of a C&C infrastructure that might have been hosted
inside the CyberBunker as a post-mortem analysis [7] suggests. We
focus onto HTTP and HTTPS traffic as the post-mortem analy-
sis [7] indicates, from the time when the infrastructure was still
active. Indeed, we find an unusual traffic pattern that potentially
points to C&C communication when looking onto the distribution
of packet sizes of HTTP and HTTPS traffic flows outgoing from
the CyberBunker. Typically, HTTP and HTTPS communication
consists of small initial packets around 64 Bytes and larger packets
that transmit the content in the range of 1300 to 1522 Bytes. In the
case of CyberBunker, we notice a large number of packets with
a size between 200 and 300 Bytes, to verify that this is indeed an
untypical traffic pattern we compare the distribution of packet sizes
of two other major hosting providers by the help of the IXP in
Figure 2. This proofs, for this case, that the CyberBunker reveals a
very unusual traffic pattern. Further investigation of this anomaly
and the targets of this unusual traffic pattern reveals around 400 /24
networks in which potential malware or bots have been contacted.

5 CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS
In this work, we took a domain and traffic perspective on the re-
cent case of the CyberBunker BPH. We find that from well known
BPH characteristics, the CyberBunker could not be identified by
upstream re-wiring in BGP. This difference to other BPH make
the CyberBunker an interesting case study. From our domain per-
spective, we find that web pages hosted by CyberBunker largely
differ from typical examples operational and legitimate web pages.
Additionally, the CyberBunker shows signs of organized web host-
ing activity, where a few IPs host the bulk of the domains. Our
traffic perspective, shows a clear deviation of traffic patterns ex-
pected from major hosting providers and the observed patterns of
C&C-traffic corresponds with the indictment and the post-mortem
analysis. Our analysis leads to the next questions: Can the identified
content of hosted websites and the discovered traffic patterns be used
to identify other BPH or is the CyberBunker an individual case?
