ABSTRACT
In the past decade the increase of for-proﬁt cybercrime has
given rise to an entire underground ecosystem supporting
large-scale abuse, a facet of which encompasses the bulk reg-
istration of fraudulent accounts. In this paper, we present a
10 month longitudinal study of the underlying technical and
ﬁnancial capabilities of criminals who register phone veriﬁed
accounts (PVA). To carry out our study, we purchase 4,695
Google PVA as well as pull a random sample of 300,000
Google PVA that Google disabled for abuse. We ﬁnd that
miscreants rampantly abuse free VOIP services to circum-
vent the intended cost of acquiring phone numbers, in eﬀect
undermining phone veriﬁcation. Combined with short lived
phone numbers from India and Indonesia that we suspect
are tied to human veriﬁcation farms, this conﬂuence of fac-
tors correlates with a market-wide price drop of 30–40% for
Google PVA until Google penalized veriﬁcations from fre-
quently abused carriers. We distill our ﬁndings into a set of
recommendations for any services performing phone veriﬁ-
cation as well as highlight open challenges related to PVA
abuse moving forward.

INTRODUCTION
In the past decade the increase of for-proﬁt cybercrime
has given rise to an entire underground ecosystem support-
ing large-scale abuse, a facet of which encompasses the bulk
registration of fraudulent accounts. Miscreants leverage this
market to obtain cheap email addresses and social network
credentials for as little as 0.50¢ an account [26], in turn fu-
eling spam and abuse at the expense of millions of users.

The deluge of messages that follow seek to monetize victims
in a variety of manners:
from spamvertised products [14]
to phishing and malware attacks that perpetrate software
scams [22], clickfraud [7], banking theft [23], or convert in-
fected victims into assets for the pay-per-install market [5].
Web services attempt to rate limit this torrent of auto-
matically generated accounts through CAPTCHAs, email
veriﬁcation, and most recently phone veriﬁcation. While
CAPTCHAs and email accounts are trivially available from
the underground for relatively low prices [15, 26], ideally
phone numbers represent a scarce resource for criminals that
are otherwise globally accessible to legitimate users [16, 17].
Consequently, when Google deployed phone veriﬁcation as
a signup protection, prices on the underground surged from
$30 per 1K to over $500. Yet there are signs that criminals
have streamlined the circumvention of phone veriﬁcation.
Prices for Google accounts have declined to as low as $85
per 1K at the time of this study.
In this paper, we present a longitudinal study of the un-
derlying technical and ﬁnancial factors inﬂuencing the di-
minishing eﬀectiveness of phone veriﬁcation. To conduct
our study, we track phone veriﬁed account (PVA) abuse on
Google over a 10 month period from July, 2013–April, 2014.
Our perspective includes 4,695 accounts purchased from a
cross-section of 14 account merchants selling Google PVA
on blackmarket forums and storefronts as well as a sample
of 300,000 PVA disabled by Google for abuse. We rely on
these dual datasets to monitor the pricing and organization
of the market for phone veriﬁed accounts; evaluate how mis-
creants circumvent the intended cost of phone veriﬁcation;
and identify a set of recommendations for preserving the
long term viability of phone veriﬁcation.
We ﬁnd that merchants are capable of registering a steady
stream of thousands of PVA that subsequently sell for $85–
$500 per 1K to the underground. This wildly diﬀerent price
range reﬂects both the ﬁnancial barrier imposed by phone
veriﬁcation (where some merchants advertise real SIM cards
from a variety of regions and prices) as well as the inﬂuence
of account resellers operating in a similar fashion to spam
aﬃliate programs [14]. Merchants fulﬁll orders for fully func-
tioning, phone veriﬁed accounts within 24–48 hours, though
the lifetime of accounts is dubious; 68% of the PVA we pur-
chase are disabled within a month of their changing hands
despite laying dormant, likely due to re-used infrastructure.
We analyze the registration process tied to abusive PVA to
understand the root source of phone numbers and the most
frequently abused carriers. We ﬁnd that 24% of PVA dis-
abled by Google are veriﬁed with free VOIP numbers from
Bandwidth.com (which services Google Voice, Pinger, and
other providers [3]), eﬀectively allowing miscreants to cir-
cumvent the cost of acquiring SIM cards. The remaining
accounts in our dataset are veriﬁed with phone numbers
tied to a variety of mobile carriers, the most popular of
which originate from India and Indonesia. We ﬁnd evidence
these regions are traditionally related to CAPTCHA farms
and underground hired labor, suggesting that abusive phone
veriﬁcation may be a manual endeavor. Combined with reg-
ular re-use of short lived phone numbers, this conﬂuence of
factors correlates with a market-wide price drop of 30–40%
for Google PVA from November, 2013–February, 2014 until
Google penalized veriﬁcations from frequently abused carri-
ers.
Based on our ﬁndings, we produce a set of recommen-
dations and best practices for services that rely on phone
veriﬁcation.
In particular, we propose a carrier reputa-
tion system that automatically penalizes SMS and VOIP
providers consistently associated with abusive accounts. Al-
ternative approaches—such as blacklisting phone numbers
upon abuse detection to prevent re-use—are too slow com-
pared to the velocity that phone numbers appear and disap-
pear. Ultimately, we argue that a global phone number rep-
utation similar to IP and domain reputation systems [1, 12]
is required to prevent miscreants from amortizing the cost
of abusive SIMs and VOIP numbers across multiple ser-
vices, as well as to prepare for the potential of compromised
phones—already a challenge for banking two-factor authen-
tication [27]—serving as a platform for verifying accounts in
the future.
In summary, we frame our contributions as follows:
• We conduct a 10-month longitudinal study of the ﬁ-
nancial and technical challenges related to phone ver-
iﬁed abuse.
• We ﬁnd an increased reliance on VOIP numbers and in-
expensive SIMs from India and Indonesia—likely tied
to manual veriﬁcation farms—correlate with a price
drop of 30–40% for Google PVA.
• We evaluate a number of underground practices in-
cluding phone re-use, phone access durations, and pre-
ferred carriers.
• We distill our ﬁndings into a set of recommendations
and best practices for services that rely on phone ver-
iﬁcation.
2. BACKGROUND
Phone veriﬁcation is a single iteration in a long evolution
of abuse safeguards that aim to prevent the bulk registration
of accounts. We provide an overview of the process behind
phone veriﬁcation, how the underground market has under-
mined prior protections, and privacy and ethical standards
we obied by when studying phone veriﬁed abuse.
2.1 Phone Veriﬁcation Process
Phone veriﬁcation serves as both an initial signup protec-
tion as well as an abuse escalation where services prevent
suspicious account from conducting further actions until af-
ter veriﬁcation. To start the veriﬁcation process, a client
provides a number they wish to associate with their account.
The server then sends a challenge PIN via SMS or voice to
that number which the client must correctly enter into a web
form to prove receipt and complete the process. Phone ver-
iﬁcation is currently employed by Google, Facebook, Twit-
ter, LinkedIn, and Craigslist among other services to combat
abuse as well as for security and account recovery purposes.
Phone veriﬁcation imposes a cost on both criminals and
services. For criminals, a single number typically has a hard
limit on the quantity of accounts it can be associated with.
Re-use also exposes bulk accounts to clustering where one
abuse violation can trigger a cascade of deactivations across
correlated accounts. Consequently, miscreants require a con-
stant stream of fresh numbers to seed registrations. Con-
versely, services employing phone veriﬁcation as a defense
incur a fee for each SMS or voice challenge. This exposes
services to typical operational costs as well as resource ex-
haustion attacks where miscreants request SMS veriﬁcation
for a deluge of numbers tied to expensive carriers to incur
exorbitant SMS fees, a threat we discuss further in Section 6.
2.2 Evolution of Abuse Safeguards
Phone veriﬁcation builds on a history of defenses that in-
cludes IP reputation, CAPTCHAs, and email veriﬁcation.
Ideally, these are scarce resources for criminals to acquire
that otherwise exert little friction on legitimate users.
In
practice, many of these components are readily available
from the underground.
IP Addresses: Services can leverage IP addresses as a weak
identity tied to newly registered accounts. When thousands
of accounts are registered from a single IP, there is a strong
likelihood of abuse. To circumvent detection, criminals rely
on compromised hosts and proxy services to acquire access
to tens of thousands of IPs [26]. Anecdotally, we see adver-
tisements for proxies as low as $250/mo for 15,000–30,000
IPs on blackmarket forums.
CAPTCHAs: CAPTCHAs—intended as human-solvable
tasks that prevent automation—have become a staple of
the underground economy [15]. Services such as http://
spamvilla.com advertise automated CAPTCHA solvers with
50% accuracy for $30/mo, while human CAPTCHA farms
such as http:// antigate.com outsource CAPTCHA solving
to an array of laborers operating out of India, Pakistan,
Ukraine, Russia, Vietnam, and Indonesia for $0.70 per 1K
solutions. The availability of manual solvers undermines
the feasibility of CAPTCHAs (though such services are not
free).
Email Veriﬁcation: Email veriﬁcation serves to tie the
rate miscreants can create accounts to the rate they can
acquire email addresses. This eﬀectively outsources abuse
prevention to email providers who in turn must rely on al-
ternative signals. In response, email addresses have become
a fundamental resource of the underground. Hotmail.com
and Yahoo.com accounts are available from merchants for
as low as $5 per 1K [26].
Each of these scenarios highlight how the underground
evolves over time to respond to new defenses. While bleak
from a defenders perspective, each successive protection in-
creases the cost of accounts, cutting into the bottom line of
spam and abuse.
2.3 Privacy and Ethical Considerations
Part of our study requires interacting with underground
merchants selling Google phone veriﬁed accounts as well as
analyzing registration data tied to abusive signups. We build
on the guidelines originally discussed by Thomas et al. [26]
for interacting with the account underground. Prior to our
study, we worked with the authors respective institutions as
well as Google to set down a policy for purchasing accounts.
We conduct all purchases (which would otherwise violate
Google’s Terms of Service) with Google’s express permis-
sion. Furthermore, even though merchants provide us with
passwords, we never access accounts. Finally, we restrict our
analysis to merchants who publicly advertise Google phone
veriﬁed accounts; we do not purchase accounts beyond this
scope nor attempt to deceive or coerce the merchants in-
volved.
3. CAPTURING ABUSIVE ACCOUNTS
To conduct our study, we rely on two sources of phone
veriﬁed accounts (PVA): purchased accounts acquired from
a cross section of the underground economy and a sample
of abusive accounts disabled by Google for Terms of Service
violations related to spam and abuse. We combine these two
datasets to provide insights into the pricing of phone veriﬁed
accounts as well as to understand the scope of Google phone
veriﬁed abuse.
3.1 Purchased Accounts
Our purchased account dataset consists of 2,217 PVA that
we buy in July 2013 at the onset of our study and a sec-
ond set of 2,478 we purchase at the conclusion of our study
in April 2014. We rely on purchasing to validate the au-
thenticity of merchants as well as to understand the market
organization for phone veriﬁed accounts. We provide an
overview of how we identify account merchants, the prices
they charge, and the duration merchants stockpile accounts.
We ﬁnd that 68% of the accounts we purchase in July are dis-
abled by Google’s infrastructure within one month. Given
this high coverage, we elected not to conduct regular repur-
chases and instead concentrate our analysis on PVA disabled
by Google throughout our study. We believe this minimizes
our ﬁnancing of underground merchants without sacriﬁcing
access to a representative sample of PVA abuse. We rely
on our second purchase in April 2014 to understand how
the market has adapted, providing a detailed comparison in
Section 5. We restrict the remainder of our discussion in
this section to our ﬁrst purchase set.
3.1.1 Merchants
We identify a cross section of 14 merchants advertising ac-
cess to Google accounts (among other services) on web store-
fronts, blackhat forums, and freelance labor pages. For oper-
ational concerns we refrain from documenting the identities
of the merchants we solicit. Advertisements range in so-
phistication from automatically generated accounts with no
proﬁle information to “manually generated” accounts with
“real SIM cards” from Eastern Europe which cost substan-
tially more. From this bazaar, we elect to purchase 2,217
PVA split across 3 merchants on blackhat forums and 4 mer-
chants operating their own storefronts in July, 2013. Mer-
chants fulﬁlled all orders in 24-48 hours with working, phone
veriﬁed accounts. We provide a summary of these purchases
in Table 1 which we reference throughout this section.
As an extension of purchasing, we also track the pricing
of Google PVA (and non-PVA) based on public listings ad-
