## Abstract
In the past decade, the rise of for-profit cybercrime has led to an extensive underground ecosystem supporting large-scale abuse, including the bulk registration of fraudulent accounts. This paper presents a 10-month longitudinal study of the technical and financial capabilities of criminals who register phone-verified accounts (PVA). We purchased 4,695 Google PVAs and analyzed a random sample of 300,000 Google PVAs disabled for abuse. Our findings reveal that miscreants exploit free VoIP services to circumvent the cost of acquiring phone numbers, undermining the effectiveness of phone verification. Additionally, short-lived phone numbers from India and Indonesia, likely tied to human verification farms, have contributed to a 30–40% market-wide price drop for Google PVAs until Google penalized verifications from frequently abused carriers. We distill our findings into a set of recommendations for services using phone verification and highlight open challenges related to PVA abuse.

## 1. Introduction
The rise of for-profit cybercrime over the past decade has given rise to an entire underground ecosystem supporting large-scale abuse, including the bulk registration of fraudulent accounts. Miscreants leverage this market to obtain cheap email addresses and social network credentials for as little as $0.50 per account, fueling spam and abuse at the expense of millions of users. The deluge of messages that follow seeks to monetize victims through various means, such as spamvertised products, phishing and malware attacks, click fraud, banking theft, or converting infected victims into assets for the pay-per-install market.

Web services attempt to limit this torrent of automatically generated accounts through CAPTCHAs, email verification, and most recently, phone verification. While CAPTCHAs and email accounts are trivially available from the underground for relatively low prices, phone numbers represent a scarce resource for criminals that are otherwise globally accessible to legitimate users. Consequently, when Google deployed phone verification as a signup protection, prices on the underground surged from $30 per 1K to over $500. However, there are signs that criminals have streamlined the circumvention of phone verification, with prices for Google accounts declining to as low as $85 per 1K at the time of this study.

In this paper, we present a longitudinal study of the underlying technical and financial factors influencing the diminishing effectiveness of phone verification. We track PVA abuse on Google over a 10-month period from July 2013 to April 2014, analyzing 4,695 accounts purchased from 14 account merchants and a sample of 300,000 PVAs disabled by Google for abuse. Our dual datasets allow us to monitor the pricing and organization of the PVA market, evaluate how miscreants circumvent the intended cost of phone verification, and identify recommendations for preserving the long-term viability of phone verification.

We find that merchants can register a steady stream of thousands of PVAs that sell for $85–$500 per 1K on the underground. This wide price range reflects both the financial barrier imposed by phone verification and the influence of account resellers. Merchants fulfill orders for fully functioning, phone-verified accounts within 24–48 hours, but the lifetime of these accounts is dubious; 68% of the PVAs we purchase are disabled within a month, likely due to re-used infrastructure. Our analysis of the registration process reveals that 24% of PVAs are verified with free VoIP numbers, allowing miscreants to circumvent the cost of acquiring SIM cards. The remaining accounts are verified with phone numbers from mobile carriers, primarily from India and Indonesia, suggesting a manual verification process. Combined with the regular re-use of short-lived phone numbers, this confluence of factors correlates with a 30–40% market-wide price drop for Google PVAs until Google penalized verifications from frequently abused carriers.

Based on our findings, we produce a set of recommendations and best practices for services that rely on phone verification, including a carrier reputation system to automatically penalize SMS and VoIP providers consistently associated with abusive accounts.

### Summary of Contributions:
- Conducted a 10-month longitudinal study of the financial and technical challenges related to PVA abuse.
- Found an increased reliance on VoIP numbers and inexpensive SIMs from India and Indonesia, correlating with a 30–40% price drop for Google PVAs.
- Evaluated underground practices, including phone re-use, phone access durations, and preferred carriers.
- Distilled our findings into a set of recommendations and best practices for services using phone verification.

## 2. Background
Phone verification is part of a long evolution of abuse safeguards aimed at preventing the bulk registration of accounts. We provide an overview of the phone verification process, how the underground market has undermined prior protections, and the privacy and ethical standards we adhered to during our study.

### 2.1 Phone Verification Process
Phone verification serves as both an initial signup protection and an abuse escalation measure. To start the verification process, a client provides a phone number, and the server sends a challenge PIN via SMS or voice. The client must enter the PIN into a web form to complete the verification. This method is used by services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Craigslist to combat abuse and for security and account recovery purposes.

Phone verification imposes costs on both criminals and services. For criminals, a single number typically has a hard limit on the number of accounts it can be associated with, and re-use exposes bulk accounts to clustering and deactivation. Services incur fees for each SMS or voice challenge, which can also expose them to resource exhaustion attacks.

### 2.2 Evolution of Abuse Safeguards
Phone verification builds on a history of defenses, including IP reputation, CAPTCHAs, and email verification. These are ideally scarce resources for criminals but are often readily available from the underground.

- **IP Addresses:** Services use IP addresses as a weak identity for newly registered accounts. Criminals use compromised hosts and proxy services to acquire access to tens of thousands of IPs.
- **CAPTCHAs:** Intended as human-solvable tasks, CAPTCHAs are now easily solved by automated solvers and human farms.
- **Email Verification:** Email verification ties the rate of account creation to the rate of email acquisition, outsourcing abuse prevention to email providers.

Each of these scenarios highlights how the underground evolves to respond to new defenses, increasing the cost of accounts and cutting into the bottom line of spam and abuse.

### 2.3 Privacy and Ethical Considerations
Our study involves interacting with underground merchants selling Google PVAs and analyzing registration data tied to abusive signups. We adhere to guidelines for interacting with the account underground, working with our respective institutions and Google to set down a policy for purchasing accounts. We conduct all purchases with Google's express permission and never access the accounts provided by merchants.

## 3. Capturing Abusive Accounts
To conduct our study, we rely on two sources of phone-verified accounts (PVAs): purchased accounts from the underground economy and a sample of abusive accounts disabled by Google for Terms of Service violations related to spam and abuse. We combine these datasets to provide insights into the pricing of PVAs and the scope of Google PVA abuse.

### 3.1 Purchased Accounts
Our purchased account dataset consists of 2,217 PVAs bought in July 2013 and a second set of 2,478 PVAs purchased in April 2014. We use these purchases to validate the authenticity of merchants and understand the market organization for PVAs. We find that 68% of the accounts purchased in July are disabled by Google within one month. Given this high coverage, we focus our analysis on PVAs disabled by Google throughout our study, minimizing our financing of underground merchants without sacrificing access to a representative sample of PVA abuse.

#### 3.1.1 Merchants
We identified a cross-section of 14 merchants advertising access to Google accounts on web storefronts, blackhat forums, and freelance labor pages. Advertisements range from automatically generated accounts to "manually generated" accounts with "real SIM cards" from Eastern Europe, which cost substantially more. We purchased 2,217 PVAs split across 3 merchants on blackhat forums and 4 merchants operating their own storefronts in July 2013. All orders were fulfilled within 24-48 hours with working, phone-verified accounts. Table 1 summarizes these purchases.
