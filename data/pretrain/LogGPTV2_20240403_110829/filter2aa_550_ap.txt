such as that negotiated for chemical weapons. Articles to such a treaty might ban 
supply chain attacks and the disruption of non-combatant networks, as well as in-
crease international management of the Internet. One objection to the second ap-
proach is that it does little to improve cyber attack attribution.382
380 As computer incident response teams began to block hostile network packets, the source of the attack 
moved to countries with less mature and/or helpful network management practices.

tegic Intelligence and Warning, Integrate Counterintelligence Capabilities, and Support Current Op-

NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
The Convention on Cybercrime is the first such international treaty. It describes law 
enforcement powers and procedures related to data interception and the search 
of computer networks. In 2009, forty-six nations were signatories, and twenty-six 
had ratified the treaty.383 Its main objective, set out in the Preamble, is to pursue 
a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, 
especially via national legislation and international cooperation. Deterrence is spe-
cifically mentioned as a goal: “the present Convention is necessary to deter action 
directed against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer systems.”
The continued success of the Convention on Cybercrime requires addressing myriad 
national and international data security and privacy concerns, including the respect 
for national sovereignty. A non-governmental organization in Thailand, for example, 
has claimed that similar legislation there has been used by the government more 
to threaten Thai citizens than to protect them.384 A proposed international treaty 
banning the development and use of hacker tools would be no less challenging to 
sign and enforce, because many hacker tools can properly be called dual-use tech-
nology.385
The Council of Europe’s protocol on criminalizing racist and xenophobic statements 
on the Web may offer a partial solution. Because countries have wildly varying laws 
regarding what constitutes free speech, universally-accessible websites can create 
international legal headaches.386 This protocol recommends a nationally-tailored ap-
proach to regulation that allows for implementation at the local ISP and end-user 
levels. In this way, signatories are able to project their norms of free speech onto the 
Internet, without extending liability beyond national borders.387388
Denial: Credibility
Deterrence theory states that capability and communication alone are insufficient. 
The threatened party must believe that the threat of retaliation – or of a preemptive 
strike – is real. This third requirement of deterrence is the most difficult for national

Cyber defense studies in academia require hacker tools for laboratory purposes.

security leadership to assess because it involves evaluating human psychology, ra-
tionality, the odds of miscalculation, and foreign political-military affairs.
At the beginning of the year 2011, it was still not likely that nation-states would 
sacrifice much to prevent the proliferation of cyber attack tools and techniques. Al-
though it is indisputable that cyber attacks cause enormous financial damage, that 
world leaders increasingly complain of cyber espionage, and that Internet-connect-
ed critical infrastructures are now at risk, deterrence theory was created for nuclear 
weapons. In terms of their destructive power, nukes are in a class by themselves. 
Cyber attacks per se do not cause explosions, deadly heat, radiation, an electro-
magnetic pulse (EMP), or human casualties.389
However, a future cyber attack, if it caused any of the above effects, could change 
this perception. Worldwide technological convergence, as described by Dawson,390 
is constantly expanding what hackers call the “attack surface.” In theory, the suc-
cessful conquest of an adversary’s Internet space could equate to assuming com-
mand and control of the adversary’s military forces, and firing their own weapons 
against their own cities. But for now, this scenario still lies in the realm of science 
fiction.
Cyber Attack Deterrence by Punishment
Deterrence by punishment is a strategy of last resort. It signifies that deterrence by 
denial was not possible or has failed, and that Country X possesses the technology 
it needs to threaten Country Y or its government. The goal of deterrence by punish-
ment is to prevent aggression by threatening greater aggression in the form of pain-
ful and perhaps fatal retaliation. For the strategy to work, Country X must be con-
vinced that victory is not possible, even given the option of using its new technology.
Two key aspects of cyber attacks present challenges to national security planners 
who would seek to deter them by punishment: attribution and asymmetry. The first 
challenge undermines a state’s capability to respond to a cyber attack, and the sec-
ond undermines its credibility.
Punishment: Capability
All nations with robust military, law enforcement, and/or diplomatic might theoreti-
cally have the power to punish a cyber attacker in some way, either in cyberspace

or in the real world. And if a known attacker is beyond the reach of physical pursuit, 
the victim could at least present incriminating evidence in an international forum. 
But in practice, for punishment to be a viable option, the victim must know for sure 
who the attacker is and be able to prove it.
In cyber warfare, the attacker enjoys a formidable advantage: anonymity. Proof in 
cyberspace is hard to come by. Smart hackers hide within the maze-like architec-
ture of the Internet. They route attacks through countries with which the target’s 
government has poor diplomatic relations or no law enforcement cooperation, and 
exploit unwitting third-party networks. Cyber investigations typically end at a 
hacked, abandoned computer, where the trail goes cold. Plausible deniability is also 
a concern. Because hackers obscure the true origin of an attack by hopping through 
a series of compromised computers to reach their target, the real attacker could 
always claim that her computer had merely been hacked and used in someone else’s 
operation. This aspect of cyber attacks also makes “false flagging,” or intentionally 
trying to pin the blame on a third party, an attractive option.
Even in the event that cyber attack attribution is positively determined, deterrence 
by punishment is still inherently less credible than deterrence by denial. It requires 
decision-makers to make more difficult choices. A proactive law enforcement strat-
egy is easier to justify than the use of military force, which can cause physical de-
struction, human casualties, or other collateral damage. At the very least, there will 
be serious diplomatic consequences.
One important decision facing decision-makers in the aftermath of a cyber attack 
would be whether to retaliate in kind or to employ more conventional weapons. It 
may seem logical to keep the conflict within cyberspace, but a cyber-only response 
does not guarantee proportionality, and a cyber counterattack may lack the required 
precision. A misfire in cyberspace might adversely affect critical national infrastruc-
ture, such as a hospital, which could result in a violation of the Geneva Conven-
tion and even bring war crimes charges against national authorities.391 The Law of 
Armed Conflict states that the means and methods of warfare are not unlimited:392 
commanders may use “only that degree and kind of force ... required in order to 
achieve the legitimate purpose of the conflict ... with the minimum expenditure of 
life and resources.”393

Deterrence: Can We Prevent Cyber Attacks?
Punishment: Communication
Whereas deterrence by denial relies on a criminal law framework for support, the 
foundation of deterrence by punishment lies in military doctrine. When bombs be-
gin to fall on adversary targets, diplomatic and law enforcement options have nor-
mally run their course. Military doctrine serves at least two important purposes: 
to prepare a nation’s military forces for conflict, and to warn potential foes of the 
consequences of war.
It should not be surprising that the advent of an open and ubiquitous communica-
tions medium like the Internet demands a reassessment of military strategy, tactics, 
and doctrine. In 2006, a secret Israeli government report argued for a “sea change” 
in military thinking because the national security paradigm of army versus army 
was under assault by suicide bombers, Katyusha rockets and computer hackers, 
none of whom has to have direct ties to government or even be susceptible to po-
litical pressure.394 In China, the potential impact of computer network operations 
on the nature of warfare is thought to be strong enough even to have transformed 
2,500 years of military wisdom; the Chinese military has almost certainly quit the 
defensive depth of the Chinese countryside to conquer international cyberspace.395 
In Washington, one of the first reports that incoming President Obama found on his 
desk was “Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency,” which argued that the U.S. 
must have a credible military presence in cyberspace to act as a deterrent against 
operations by its adversaries in that domain.396
Cyber doctrine must address how military and civilian authorities will collaborate 
to protect private sector critical information infrastructure. Even cyber attacks that 
strike purely military sites are likely to traverse civilian networks before reaching 
their target. In fact, the destruction of civilian infrastructure may be the cyber at-
tacker’s only goal. A further challenge is that private sector enterprises such as 
banks have been reluctant to disclose successful cyber attacks against them for fear 
of an impact on their bottom line. This dynamic could make it difficult for national 
security leadership even to know that an attack on its national territory – in violation 
of its national sovereignty – has occurred. Thus, proactive cyber attack deterrence 
by government to defend civilian infrastructure will be difficult to achieve, and any 
national response may be too little, too late.
The dynamic nature of cyber attacks could ensure that defenders never see the 
same attack twice. Therefore, decision makers will need a range of diplomatic and 
military options to consider for a punitive response. In terms of military doctrine,

NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
one possibility might be the delineation of red lines in cyberspace. Propaganda and 
low-level computer network exploitation (CNE) may trigger the first line of passive 
cyber defense, while the manipulation of code in an operational weapons system 
could be grounds for real-world retaliation. Finally, to support a deterrence strategy, 
cyber doctrine must be clearly written. An adversary should have no doubt what the 
consequences will be if the red lines are crossed.
Punishment: Credibility
As we have seen, the credibility of cyber attack deterrence by denial is low. The po-
litical will and even the capability to attempt such a denial are lacking. Therefore, a 
strategy of cyber attack deterrence by punishment is a more likely scenario.
The trouble with a punishment strategy, however, is that governments are always 
reluctant to authorize the use of military force (for good reason). Deterrence by pun-
ishment is a simple strategy, but one that demands a high burden of proof: a serious 
crime must have been committed, and the culprit positively identified. The challenge 
of cyber attack attribution, as described above, means that decision-makers will 
likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, 
and operations to respond in a timely fashion.
However, there is another characteristic of cyber attacks that undermines the cred-
ibility of deterrence by punishment even more: asymmetry. At the nation-state level, 
some countries are more dependent upon the Internet than others. Some govern-
ments possess sophisticated computer network attack programs, while others have 
none at all. Non-state actors such as a lone hacker or a terrorist group may not 
possess any computer network or other identifiable infrastructure against which to 
retaliate.
The asymmetric nature of information technology and cyber warfare manifests it-
self in countless ways. From a technical perspective, the Smurf attack is a classic ex-
ample. A hacker sitting at computer X pretends to be coming from computer Y, then 
requests data from hundreds of other computers at once. Myriad responses easily 
overwhelm computer Y, creating a denial-of-service condition.397 From a human per-
spective, the case of Briton Gary McKinnon is illuminating. According to McKinnon, 
he is a “bumbling hacker” who was merely looking for UFO data on unsecured Penta-
gon networks. But the U.S. prosecutor seeking his extradition describes McKinnon’s

exploits as “the biggest military computer hack of all time.”398399 In terms of financial 
damages, “MafiaBoy” – a 15 year-old kid from Montreal – in 2001 was able to deny 
Internet service to some of the world’s biggest online companies, causing an esti-
mated $1.7 billion in damage.400
Mutually Assured Disruption (MAD)
There is a growing relationship between computer security and national security. 
Military leaders, fearing the potential impact of cyber warfare as well as the start 
of a cyber arms race, are now considering whether it is possible proactively to deter 
cyber attacks.
At the nation-state level, there are two possible deterrence strategies: denial and 
punishment. In cyberspace, both suffer from a lack of credibility. Denial is unlikely 
due to the ease with which cyber attack technology can be acquired, the immaturity 
of international legal frameworks, the absence of an inspection regime, and the per-
ception that cyber attacks are not dangerous enough to merit deterrence in the first 
place. Punishment is the only real option, but this deterrence strategy lacks cred-
ibility due to the daunting challenges of cyber attack attribution and asymmetry.
At a minimum, attribution must improve before a cyber attacker may feel deterred. 
This will take time. In the short term, organizations must improve their ability to 
collect and transmit digital evidence, especially to international partners. In the long 
term, national security planners should try to create a Distant Early Warning Line 
(DEWL) for cyber war and the capability to select from a range of rapid response 
tactics.
To pave the way forward, a legal foundation for cyber attack, defense, and deter-
rence strategies is needed as soon as possible. Because information technology 
changes so quickly – no one can predict what the next cyber attack will look like – it 
may be necessary to adopt an effects-based approach. If a cyber attack results in a 
level of human suffering or economic destruction equivalent to a conventional mili-
tary attack, then it could be considered an act of war, and it should be subject to the 
existing laws of war. Consequently, national security planners have no time to waste 
in reevaluating, and updating, if necessary, the Geneva, Hague, and Human Rights 
conventions, as well as the Just War theory, and more.

NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Back to the Cold War. By the year 1968, Soviet mastery of nuclear technology had 
made one-sided nuclear deterrence meaningless.401 The U.S. and the USSR were 
forced into a position of mutual deterrence or Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). 
Both sides had the ultimate weapon, as well as a second-strike capability. Although 
cyber attacks do not possess the power of a nuclear explosion, they do pose a se-
rious and increasing threat to international security, and anti-proliferation efforts 
appear futile. Welcome to the era of Mutually Assured Disruption.402

nuclear arms race, that changed the strategic equation in 1968.

WEAPONS?
As world leaders look beyond temporary fixes to the challenge of securing the In-
ternet, one possible solution may be an international arms control treaty for cyber-
space. The 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) provides national security 
planners with a useful model. CWC has been ratified by 98% of the world’s govern-
ments and encompasses 95% of the world’s population. It compels signatories not 
to produce or to use chemical weapons (CW), and they must destroy existing CW 
stockpiles. As a means and method of war, CW have now almost completely lost 
their legitimacy. This chapter examines the aspects of CWC that could help to con-
tain conflict in cyberspace. It also explores the characteristics of cyber warfare that 
seem to defy traditional threat mitigation.
Cyber Attack Mitigation by Political Means
The world has grown so dependent on the Internet that governments may seek far-
reaching strategic solutions to help ensure its security. Every day, more aspects of 
modern society, business, government, and critical infrastructure are computerized 
and connected to the Internet. As a consequence and for the sake of everything from 
the production of electricity to the integrity of national elections, network security 
is no longer a luxury, but a necessity.403
A fundamental challenge to better network security is that computers are highly 
complex objects that are inherently difficult to secure. The Common Vulnerabilities 
and Exposures (CVE) List grows by nearly one hundred every month.404 There are 
likely more pathways into your computer network than your system administrators 
can protect. And to a large degree, this explains the high return on investment en-
joyed by cyber criminals and cyber spies.
In the future, if war breaks out between two or more major world powers, one of
