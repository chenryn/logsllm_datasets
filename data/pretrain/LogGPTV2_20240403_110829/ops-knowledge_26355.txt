User: When writing a Python 3.1 CGI script, I run into horrible UnicodeDecodeErrors. However, when running the script on the command line, everything works.
It seems that open() and print() use the return value of locale.getpreferredencoding() to know what encoding to use by default. When running on the command line, that value is 'UTF-8', as it should be. But when running the script through a browser, the encoding mysteriously gets redefined to 'ANSI_X3.4-1968', which appears to be a just a fancy name for plain ASCII.
I now need to know how to make the cgi script run with 'utf-8' as the default encoding in all cases. My setup is Python 3.1.3 and Apache2 on Debian Linux. The system-wide locale is en_GB.utf-8.
Assistant: Summarizing @cercatrova 's answer:

Add PassEnv LANG line to the end of your /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or .htaccess.
Uncomment . /etc/default/locale line in /etc/apache2/envvars.
Make sure line similar to LANG="en_US.UTF-8" is present in /etc/default/locale.
sudo service apache2 restart
