## Abstract
Privacy policy statements are the primary means for service providers to inform Internet users about their data collection and use practices. However, these policies are often lengthy and lack a clear structure. In this work, we introduce TLDR, a pipeline that leverages various deep representation techniques for normalizing privacy policies through learning and modeling, and an automated ensemble classifier for privacy policy categorization. TLDR advances the state-of-the-art by (i) classifying policy content into nine categories with high accuracy, (ii) detecting missing information in privacy policies, and (iii) significantly reducing the time required to read and understand these policies.

## 1 Introduction
Privacy policy statements are legal documents that inform Internet users about the data collection and usage practices of websites and businesses. These policies are often long and complex, making it difficult for the average user to fully comprehend the content. It has been estimated that reading all encountered privacy policies annually would take an average user 201 hours [7].

A key challenge is the ambiguity and lack of standardization in privacy policies, which can overwhelm users both in terms of the number of policies they must read and the complexity of each policy. While several attempts have been made to improve readability [3], privacy policies still lack a standardized format. Recent studies [5, 6, 9, 10] have used natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to annotate privacy policy content effectively.

To build on these efforts, this work investigates several annotation techniques for practical automation of policy annotation. Our goal is to provide users with high-level annotations on whether various privacy policies meet certain requirements regarding a broad set of privacy and security expectations. We developed an ensemble of classifiers using six word representation techniques and learning algorithms to automate policy annotation.

Our pipeline, called TLDR, operates at the paragraph level and is trained on nine categories that highlight different uses typically found in privacy policies. The ensemble outputs a binary decision for each category, indicating whether a paragraph contains information relevant to a specific privacy policy category.

Through experiments on a widely used dataset, we show that TLDR achieves high performance in categorizing privacy policy practices, with an average F1 score of 91%, and can highlight important paragraphs within a privacy policy. A user study demonstrates that TLDR reduces reading time by 39.14% and improves understandability by 18.84%. Additionally, TLDR's extracted statements are preferred over the original policies 67% of the time.

### Contributions
In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art in privacy policy annotation with the following contributions:
1. **TLDR Pipeline**: We propose TLDR, a pipeline that employs various deep privacy policy representation techniques and an automated ensemble of privacy policy classifiers, achieving a state-of-the-art average F1 score of 91%.
2. **Analysis of Privacy Practices**: Using TLDR, we analyze the privacy practices of the top 10,000 Alexa-ranked websites, uncovering major issues in reporting user tracking and data security practices.
3. **Paragraph Highlighting Mechanism**: We develop a mechanism to reduce the number of paragraphs a user needs to read to identify specific privacy practices.
4. **User Study**: We conduct a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of TLDR in highlighting important paragraphs. The study shows that 67% of participants prefer reading the highlighted paragraphs over the original policies.

## 2 The TLDR Pipeline
The TLDR pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. Below, we describe the implementation of each step in the pipeline.

### Ground Truth and Key Terminology
For baseline privacy policy annotation, we use the Online Privacy Policies (OPP-115) dataset [9]. This dataset includes 115 manually annotated privacy policies, categorized into nine categories, such as first-party data collection, third-party information sharing, and user tracking practices.

### Privacy Policy Preprocessing
For each paragraph, we remove stop words, perform tokenization, and apply other preprocessing steps to prepare the text for analysis.
