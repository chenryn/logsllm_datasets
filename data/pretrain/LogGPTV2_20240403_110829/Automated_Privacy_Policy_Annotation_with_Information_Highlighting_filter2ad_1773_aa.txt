ABSTRACT
The privacy policy statements are the primary mean for service
providers to inform Internet users about their data collection and
use practices, although they often are long and lack a specific struc-
ture. In this work, we introduce TLDR, a pipeline that employs
various deep representation techniques for normalizing policies
through learning and modeling, and an automated ensemble classi-
fier for privacy policy classification. TLDR advances the state-of-
the-art by (i) categorizing policy contents into nine privacy policy
categories with high accuracy, (ii) detecting missing information in
privacy policies, and (iii) significantly reducing policy reading time
and improving understandability by users.

1 INTRODUCTION
The privacy policy statements are legal statements that inform
Internet users about websites and businesses data collection and
information usage practices. Those policies are long and complex,
and it is argued that the ordinary user may not thoroughly under-
stand the context of the policy, nor the website‚Äôs actual practices.
It has been estimated that it would take the average user 201 hours
to read the privacy policies encountered per year [7].
A key challenge in this space that the prior work tried to ad-
dress is the ambiguity and lack of a standard format in privacy
policies. Especially, users would be overwhelmed by both the poli-
cies breadth (i.e., many policies to deal with every year) and depth
(i.e., complexity of the individual policies). While several attempts
are made to improve their readability [3], privacy policies still lack

a standard format, as of the moment of writing this work. Moti-
vated by that, recent studies [5, 6, 9, 10] leveraged natural language
processing and deep learning techniques to effectively annotate the
privacy policies contents.
To improve upon those studies, this work investigates several
annotation techniques for a practical automation of policy annota-
tion. The goal of our annotation is to provide users with high-level
annotations on whether various privacy policies they encounter in
their daily life meet certain requirements with respect to a broad
set of privacy and security expectations. In particular, we built an
ensemble of classifiers using six word representation techniques
and learning algorithms for automating policy annotation.
Our pipeline, called TLDR, operates at the paragraph level, and
is trained on nine categories highlighting different uses typically
found in the privacy policies. The ensemble outputs a binary deci-
sion for each category, positive (i.e., a paragraph contains informa-
tion on the privacy policy category) or negative (i.e., a paragraph
does not contain such information).
Through experiments on a widely used dataset, we show that
TLDR achieves high performance in categorizing privacy policy
practices, with an average ùêπ1 score of 91%, and can highlight im-
portant paragraphs within a privacy policy. Through a user study,
we show that TLDR reduces the reading time by 39.14%. Moreover,
by eliminating unnecessary information in the policy statements,
TLDR improves their understandability by 18.84%. TLDR also is
shown effective in highlighting critical information of the privacy
policy, and its extracted statements are shown to be preferred over
the original policies in 67% of the times, per our user study.
Contribution. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art on
privacy policy annotation by delivering the following contributions:
(1) We propose TLDR, a pipeline that employs various deep
privacy policy representation techniques and an automated
ensemble of privacy policy classifiers. TLDR achieves a state-
of-the-art average ùêπ1 score of 91%.
(2) Using TLDR, we analyze the privacy practices in Alexa top-
10,000 websites, unveiling major issues in reporting user
tracking and data security practices by those websites.
(3) We develop a paragraph highlighting mechanism to reduce
the number of paragraphs that a user needs to read in order
to uncover certain privacy practices in a privacy policy.
(4) We conduct a user study to understand the effectiveness
of TLDR in highlighting important paragraphs within the
privacy policy. In this user study, 67% participants expressed
that they prefer to read the privacy policy with only the
highlighted paragraphs over the original policies.

2 THE TLDR PIPELINE
The TLDR pipeline is shown in Figure 1. In the following, we de-
scribe the process of implementing each of TLDR‚Äôs steps.
Ground Truth and Key Terminology. As a baseline for privacy
policy annotation, we used the Online Privacy Policies (OPP-115)
dataset [9]. The dataset consists of privacy policies collected from
115 websites, manually annotated to 9 categories, including paragraph-
level associated privacy policies, such as first-party data collection,
third party information sharing, and user tracking practices.
Privacy Policy Preprocessing. For each paragraph, the stopwords,
