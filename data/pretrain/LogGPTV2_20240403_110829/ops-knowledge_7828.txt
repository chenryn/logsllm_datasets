User: OS: ubuntu 16.04LTS
Python: 2.7.12 + Anaconda2-4.2.0 (64 bit)
I typed pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL to install tensorflow but terminal showed that my pip verson was 8.1.1, however version 9.0.1 is available. 
Then I typed pip install --upgrade pip to upgrade but it showed 
Requirement already up-to-date: pip in ./anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages, 
I still can't use pip version 9.0.1 to install tensorflow. Does anyone know what's going on ??
Assistant: If you're only installing things to one user account it is also possible to use pip install --user --upgrade pip avoiding the question of to sudo or not to sudo... just be careful not to use that account with system wide installation of pip goodies.
