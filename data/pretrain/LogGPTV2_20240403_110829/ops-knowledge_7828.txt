**Operating System:** Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  
**Python Version:** 2.7.12 + Anaconda2-4.2.0 (64-bit)

I attempted to install TensorFlow by running the command `pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL`, but the terminal indicated that my current pip version is 8.1.1, even though version 9.0.1 is available.

To upgrade pip, I then ran `pip install --upgrade pip`. However, the terminal responded with:
```
Requirement already up-to-date: pip in ./anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages
```

Despite this, I am still unable to use pip version 9.0.1 to install TensorFlow. Can anyone provide some insight into what might be happening?

**Response:**

If you are installing packages for a single user account, you can try using the following command to upgrade pip:
```bash
pip install --user --upgrade pip
```

This approach avoids the need to use `sudo` and installs the package for your user account only. Be cautious, however, as this method should not be used if you intend to perform system-wide installations of pip packages.
