ATT&CK Technique Name:User Account Management
Enforce authentication and role-based access control on the container API to restrict users to the least privileges required.[10] When using Kubernetes, avoid giving users wildcard permissions or adding users to the system:masters group, and use RoleBindings rather than ClusterRoleBindings to limit user privileges to specific namespaces.[11]
