5.  Summary and Conclusions 
This  paper  shows  how  clustered  adjacency  matrices 
reveal  the  underlying  regularities  in  network  attack 
graphs.  Our approach is particularly attractive because it 
avoids  the  edge  clutter  usually  associated  with  literal 
drawings  of  attack  graphs.    The  adjacency  matrix  is 
concise,  representing  each  graph  edge  with  a  single 
matrix  element.    Our  approach  places  no  particular

restrictions  on  the  form  of  the  attack  graph.    It  therefore 
applies to attack graphs based on network vulnerabilities, 
detected  intrusions,  or  combinations  thereof,  and  well  as 
attack  graphs  with  aggregated  vertices,  e.g.,  aggregated 
by  network  machine.    Our  approach  has  low-order 
polynomial  complexity  overall,  for  scalability  to  larger 
networks. 
The  information-theoretic  clustering  algorithm  we 
apply reorders rows and columns of the adjacency matrix 
so  that  rectangular  blocks  of  similarly-connected  attack 
graph elements emerge.  This clustering algorithm is fully 
automatic,  parameter-free,  and  scales 
linearly  with 
problem  size.    We  further  transform  the  attack  graph 
adjacency  matrix  by  raising  it  to  higher  powers,  to 
represent  multiple  attack  steps.    We  can  thus  show 
attacker  reachability  across  the  network  within  any 
number  of  attack  steps.    We  combine  these  per-step 
reachability  matrices  into  a  single  matrix  that  shows  the 
minimum number of steps between any pair of vertices in 
the attack graph.  We also summarize reachability over all 
number of steps via transitive closure. 
Through  our  general  approach,  we  are  able  to 
correlate, predict, and hypothesize about network attacks.  
For  example,  we  can  provide  a  concise  summary  of 
changes  in an attack graph resulting  from changes in the 
network configuration.  We can place intrusion alarms in 
the  context  of  the  vulnerability-based  attack  graph  for 
categorizing alarms.  We can step forward from an attack, 
to  predict  its  impact  and  prioritize  defensive  responses 
according to the number of steps required to reach victim 
machines.  We can also step backward from an attack, to 
predict its origin.
