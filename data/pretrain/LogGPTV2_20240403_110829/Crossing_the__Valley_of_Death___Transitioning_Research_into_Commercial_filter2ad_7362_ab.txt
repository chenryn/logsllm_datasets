source” as a technology transition method can be useful. 
As  mentioned  by  Dr.  Carl  Landwehr,  the  question  of 
“what  results  have  come  from  the  U.S.  Government’s 
investment?” would be an excellent study as we continue to 
try to improve the “bridge” from Research Land to Vendor 
Land. 
IV. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
YEARS
A. Getting Started 
In  June  2003,  Jane  Alexander,  former  DARPA  Deputy 
Director contacted me to see if I’d be interested in coming to 
the  new  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  Science 
and  Technology  (S&T)  Directorate  and  offered  me  the 
opportunity to build the Cybersecurity R&D program within 
DHS S&T from scratch. As my time at DARPA was coming 
to a close, this was a perfect opportunity. I started at DHS 
S&T in October 2003. 
The mission of DHS S&T is to “conduct, stimulate, and 
enable  research,  development,  test,  evaluation  and  timely 
transition of homeland security capabilities to federal, state 
and local operational end-users.” This was ideally suited for 
the types of things I wanted to do that were different from 
what I had experienced at DARPA.  
Because  of  the  strong  customer  focus  on  both  internal 
infrastructure 
DHS  components  and  external  critical 
providers,  we  designed  an  R&D  execution  model  that 
included the full spectrum of what we thought was necessary 
–  research,  development,  test,  evaluation,  and  transition 
(RDTE&T) – to ensure that completed “research products” 
could actually be tested in the hands of an operational end-
user  and  potentially  result  in  a  commercial  product.  This 
model  is  shown  in  the  graphic  below  and  is  affectionately 
known as the “Circle of Life”.

The important components on the graphic include:

Customers – most R&D funded by DHS S&T is in 
response to some customer, either internal to DHS or 
an external entity or national document 
Pre-R&D  –  workshops,  roadmaps,  and  solicitations 
(see below) ensure that the funded R&D is focused 
on the needs identified by the customers 
R&D  and  Supporting  Programs  –  this  is  where  the 
work  gets  done  and  infrastructure  is  developed  to 
support the R&D program 
Post-R&D  –  this  is  where  DHS  S&T  is  very 
different from any other government R&D program 
and provides experimental deployment and outreach 
activities  to  assist  the  researchers  in  the  process  of 
transitioning technology 
B. Changing Standard Solicitations 
One of the first things I felt was needed was a change in 
the  Broad  Agency  Announcement  (BAA)  process  at  DHS 
S&T.  It  was  very  important  to  change  the  model  to 
incorporate technology transition from the start. It has been 
very interesting to watch the R&D community adapt to this 
way  of  thinking  and  the  transition  requirement  has  also 
helped  build  partnerships  that  probably  never  would  have 
been  established  otherwise. 
forced  academic 
researchers  to  work  with  commercial  companies,  which  is 
something 
to  doing 
previously.  The  pertinent  text  from  the  DHS  S&T  BAA  is 
included below: 
they  have  not  been  accustomed 
It  has 
(cid:129)  Type 
“Proposals shall be structured in phases per one of the 
three Type classifications described below, depending on the 
maturity of the proposed technology. The deployment phase 
shall  outline  the  test,  evaluation,  and  deployment  of  the 
technology,  and  shall  be  included  as  an  option  in  the 
proposal for Type I and II technologies: 
(cid:129)  Type  I  (New  Technologies)—Proposals  requesting 
funding for new technologies shall have an applied research 
phase, a development phase, and a deployment phase, with 
the  emphasis  on  research  and  development,  and  the 
deployment  phase  included  as  an  option.  Proposals  may 
request  funding  for  a  timeframe  not  to  exceed  36  months, 
including the deployment phase. 
(Prototype  Technologies)—Proposals 
requesting  funding  for  more  mature  prototype  technologies 
shall  have  a  development  phase  and  a  deployment  phase 
included as an option. Proposals may request funding for a 
timeframe not to exceed 24 months, including the deployment 
phase. 
(cid:129) Type III (Mature Technologies)—Proposals requesting 
funding  for  a  mature  technology  shall  have  a  deployment 
phase only. Proposals may request funding for a timeframe 
not to exceed 12 months. 
The  objective  of  this  structure  is  to  support  immediate 
technology  transition  wherever  possible,  and  to  create 
transition  paths  for  new  capabilities  from  the  outset.
Offerors must also include a description in the proposal of 
their plan for commercializing the technology or other plans 
II 
that 
transition  plans 
for getting the technology into established transition paths. 
Technology 
include  commercial 
partnerships  are  preferred,  but  transition  into  the  open 
source  community  is  also  acceptable.  The  intent  is  for 
offerors  to  provide  evidence  that,  as  part  of  the  technical 
plan  development,  consideration  has  been  given  to  the 
ultimate  commercialization  of  the  outputs  of  DHS-funded 
programs. Such considerations would include expected user 
base,  how  the  technology  will  be  used,  and  how  it  will 
transition  in  to  broad  use.  Of  key  importance  are  the 
identification  of 
that  are 
appropriate  for  the  type  and  maturity  of  the  technology 
involved, and any additional factors that might increase the 
likelihood  of  it  being  commercialized.  Proposals  will  be 
evaluated  with  other  proposals  that  are  submitted  to  the 
same Type (I-III) classification.”
technology  diffusion  paths 
The BAA text was a significant difference from anything 
the  cybersecurity  R&D  community  had  experienced 
previously. DHS S&T has published two BAAs and funded 
over 30 efforts over the past 6 years. Many of the winning 
teams consisted of joint academic and industry partners with 
the  industry  partner  on-board  as  the  technology  transition 
part of the team. There is still plenty of room to improve, but 
I  believe  this  is  an  important  mechanism  for  ensuring 
technologies make it out of the lab and into the marketplace. 
C. DHS S&T Successes 
Having  completed  6  years  at  DHS  S&T,  I  decided  to 
review  the  progress  and  results  of  the  program  and 
determined  that  I  had  been  responsible  for  funding  and 
managing  over  $180  million  dollars  of  research  during  the 
past 6 years. There have been many successes and far fewer 
failures,  which  I  attributed  to  the  change  to  the  RDTE&T 
model. I believe we are doing a much better job of helping 
the government-funded performer cross the ‘valley of death’. 
This  is  still  a  work  in  progress,  the  following  technology 
transitions have occurred within the DHS S&T portfolio: 
x
IronKey, Inc. was funded to develop a secure 
universal serial bus (USB) device that could provide a 
more secure environment for data protection. The 
IronKey device provides secure Web browsing, 
cryptographic authentication, end point security, self-
service password recovery, and secure password 
management.  It can withstand both simple and 
sophisticated attacks protecting critical information for 
emergency responders. IronKey won the Government 
Computer News’ Best of FOSE Award for FY 2007 
and is now available to the public as a more secure 
alternative than standard USB drives. In addition to 
DHS S&T funding, IronKey received over $20M of 
venture funding and has gone from the 2 founders to 
over 100 employees since 2005. 
Secure64 was funded to develop technology to 
make the deployment of Domain Name System 
Security (DNSSEC) easier. Secure64 developed the 
DNSSEC Signer, which is intended to fully automate 
the process of implementing and operating Domain 
Name System Security (DNSSEC). The DNSSEC 
Signer appliance is a turnkey “DNSSEC-in-a-box”

As I mentioned previously, I really didn’t take advantage 
of  the  SBIR  program  while  at  DARPA.  Given  that  DHS 
S&T  was  a  new  environment  and  had  a  much  smaller 
budget, I used the SBIR program as an excellent way to get 
lots of small technology development efforts funded. I have 
managed over 40 SBIR Phase I and over 20 SBIR Phase II 
efforts over the past 6 years and can identify 8 commercial 
products that have been successfully transitioned. A couple 
of these successes include: 
x
In 2005 Komoku, developed an advanced Root-Kit 
Detection Tool. Rootkits are malicious programs 
(malware) that are designed to take control of a 
computer’s operating system at the root level, where 
they can often hide from detection by standard anti-
malware software.  Komoku’s customers have included 
a number of high-security government agencies, 
including DARPA, the U.S. Navy, and the DOD.  
Komoku was acquired by Microsoft in March 2008. 
Endeavor Systems developed a botnet detection 
and mitigation tool called the Inline Botnet Extraction 
and Response System. An extension to their Firstlight 
product line, Endeavor focused on the development of a 
malware analysis engine and malware signature 
distributor. The tool also integrated the inline botnet 
extraction capability, analysis engine, and the signature 
distributor. Endeavor Systems was bought by McAfee 
in January 2009. 
Solidcore developed new techniques for malware 
identification, by extending existing Solidcore 
technology to perform real-time analytics and 
dissemination of analyses, with the ultimate goal of 
responding to attacks as they occur.  Solidcore is a 
leading provider of dynamic whitelisting technology 
that helps enterprises control which applications are 
installed on a computer, resulting in improved IT 
compliance, security, and availability.  Solidcore was 
purchased by McAfee in June 2009.

solution that eliminates most, if not all, of the concerns 
associated with DNSSEC deployment.  These concerns 
include complexity, cost, correct configurations, and 
security, and they are all addressed by the DNSSEC 
Signer.  The DNSSEC Signer also won the Government 
Computer News’ Best of FOSE Award for FY 2009 in 
the security software category. Secure64 has sold 
products to the Department of the Interior, Department 
of Labor, and Department of Commerce. 
The Vulnerability Discovery and Remediation Tool 
was developed by a research team from Stanford 
University, Coverity, and Symantec. The Coverity 
SCAN project uses the developed vulnerability 
discovery technology to scan open-source code to 
identify security holes that can be fixed before software 
or operating systems are released.  The system stores all 
identified bugs in a database which is accessible by 
developers, allowing them to help secure open-source 
software, which is a critical part of the Nation’s 
infrastructure.  The tool is now available as a 
commercial product and has over 900 customers across 
government and private industry. 
VIAssist, a visualization toolkit for netflow 
analytics, was developed by Secure Decisions, Inc. and 
is available commercially. This technology reduces the 
time needed to discover flow anomalies by highlighting 
important information in massive amounts of data. It 
will also present multiple perspectives to allow analysts 
to view data in new ways and understand cyber attacks 
in context. This technology is currently being piloted 
within the US-CERT for use as a visual analysis 
platform for network flow data. 
The award-winning anti-phishing technology, 
known as Password Hash (PwdHash), was developed 
by a research team from Stanford University and 
selected as the winner in Computerworld magazine's 
Horizon Awards competition for cutting-edge 
technologies. Password Hash is a browser plug-in that 
is available as open source and can be download for 
free to protect user’s personal information. It protects 
against attempts by phishers to divert Internet users to 
fraudulent Web sites in order to steal their personal and 
financial information. Password Hash is now available 
as a plug-in for all Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, 
Opera, and Chrome browsers. 
The University of Michigan has developed a 
Botnet Detection and Mitigation Tool.  Based on the 
theory that no single detection approach will 
successfully mitigate the threat of botnets, the 
University of Michigan has developed and deployed a 
system that detects bot behavior rather than specific bot 
symptoms. This more comprehensive approach means 
quicker detection and adaptability as attackers attempt 
to evade the system.  This technology is being piloted 
by United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team 
(US-CERT) and is involved in a regional deployment 
pilot with the City of Seattle. It will be made available 
via open source. 
V.CONCLUDING REMARKS
technology 
transition  needs 
In  order  to  achieve  the  necessary  deployment  of  new 
innovation, 
to  be  a  key 
consideration  for  all  R&D  investments.    This  requires  the 
federal  government  to  move  past  working  models  where 
most  R&D  programs  support  at  most  limited  operational 
evaluations  or  experiments,  most  R&D  program  managers 
consider their job done with final reports, and most research 
performers consider their job done with publications. 
Future  R&D  activities  need  to  focus  on  the  real  goal: 
technology  transition.  Current  R&D  Principal  Investigators 
(PIs)  and  Program  Managers  (PMs)  aren’t  rewarded  for 
technology  transition.  Academic  PIs  are  rewarded  for 
publications, not transition. Future government-funded R&D 
programs need to reward government program managers and 
PIs for transition progress.  
If  we  are  truly  going  to  transform  the  “innovation 
landscape”,  then  R&D  processes  need  to  ensure  that  we 
spend  program  funds  on  technology  transition  and  have  an 
25
adequate  amount  of  program  funds reserved  for  use  late  in 
the  program  to  fund  less  “researchy”,  but  equally  valuable 
processes needed to bridge the “Transition Chasm.”
