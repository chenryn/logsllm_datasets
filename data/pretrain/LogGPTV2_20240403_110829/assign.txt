Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
Assigns a drive letter or mount point to the volume with focus. You can also use this command to change the drive letter associated with a removable drive. If no drive letter or mount point is specified, the next available drive letter is assigned. If the drive letter or mount point is already in use, an error is generated.
A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the select volume command to select a volume and shift the focus to it.
Important
You can't assign drive letters to system volumes, boot volumes, or volumes that contain the paging file. In addition, you cannot assign a drive letter to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partition or any GUID Partition Table (gpt) partition other than a basic data partition.
Syntax
