### Assign Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `assign` command is used to allocate a drive letter or mount point to the volume that is currently in focus. This command can also be used to modify the drive letter associated with a removable drive. If no specific drive letter or mount point is provided, the next available drive letter will be assigned. If the specified drive letter or mount point is already in use, an error will be generated.

**Important Notes:**
- You cannot assign drive letters to system volumes, boot volumes, or volumes that contain the paging file.
- Drive letters cannot be assigned to Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partitions or any GUID Partition Table (GPT) partition other than a basic data partition.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
assign [{letter= | mount=}] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**
- **letter=**: Specifies the drive letter you want to assign to the volume.
- **mount=**: Specifies the mount point path you want to assign to the volume. For detailed instructions on using this parameter, refer to the documentation on assigning a mount point folder path to a drive.
- **noerr**: This parameter is intended for scripting purposes. When an error occurs, DiskPart will continue processing commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**
- To assign the drive letter `E` to the volume in focus, type:
  ```plaintext
  assign letter=e
  ```

**Additional Information:**
- A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the `select volume` command to select a volume and shift the focus to it.
