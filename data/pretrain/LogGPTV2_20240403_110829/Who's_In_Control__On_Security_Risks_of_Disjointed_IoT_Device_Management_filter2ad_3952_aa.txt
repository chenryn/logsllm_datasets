## Abstract
Modern IoT devices can be managed through various channels, such as the device manufacturer’s app, third-party apps like Apple’s Home, or smart speakers. Each channel is supported by a management framework integrated into the device, which we term a Device Management Channel (DMC). Common third-party DMCs include HomeKit, Zigbee/Z-Wave, and smart-speaker Seamless DMCs. These DMCs are standalone systems with full control over the device. However, if their security policies and controls are not aligned, they can be exploited by malicious users to bypass security measures. We refer to this issue as Chaotic Device Management (Codema).

This paper presents the first systematic study on Codema, using a model-guided approach. We analyzed 14 top-rated IoT devices and their integration of multiple DMCs. Our findings indicate that Codema is both widespread and fundamental, as these DMCs are generally not designed to coordinate their security policies. This allows adversaries to gain unauthorized access to sensitive devices like locks and garage doors. We reported our findings to affected parties (e.g., Apple, August, Philips Hue, ismartgate, Abode), all of whom acknowledged the importance of the issue.

To mitigate this threat, we designed and implemented CGuard, a new access control framework that can be easily integrated into IoT devices by manufacturers. Our evaluation shows that CGuard is highly usable, acceptable to users, and effective in enhancing security.

## 1 Introduction
Today’s Internet of Things (IoT) devices are managed through various frameworks, allowing users to configure and control them via mobile apps, local connections (e.g., Bluetooth), or cloud services. Some frameworks are provided by device manufacturers, while others are third-party solutions like Apple’s HomeKit, Zigbee, and Z-Wave. We define such a framework, including all its device- and cloud-side components, as a Device Management Channel (DMC).

Modern IoT devices often support multiple DMCs, including those from manufacturers and third parties. For example, an August smart lock can be controlled by HomeKit, SmartThings hub, and the August app. Each DMC is a standalone system, and their integration, if not done correctly, can have serious security implications, exposing the device to unauthorized access. Despite its importance, this problem has not been systematically studied before.

### Risks of Disjointed DMCs
Our research reveals that the integration of DMCs is fundamentally flawed, leaving different channels on the same device disjointed or inadequately coordinated in their security controls. With heterogeneous architectures and scattered security policies, each DMC can independently determine whether a specific functionality (e.g., door opening) should be granted. However, such decisions are often uncoordinated, allowing security policies configured through one channel to be circumvented through another. We call this risk chaotic device management (Codema).

### Exploiting Codema: Analysis and Discoveries
To understand the real-world impacts of Codema, we focused on four major third-party DMCs (Apple HomeKit, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and BLE-based smart speaker channels) and their integration into popular IoT devices. Using a model-guided approach, we analyzed the security management and policy coordination among different DMCs in a set of highly popular devices. Our analysis revealed that all these channels contain Codema vulnerabilities and can be easily exploited.

For example, an Airbnb homeowner who manages her ismartgate garage controller through Apple HomeKit may leave the manufacturer DMC unprotected. A guest with temporary access to the home Wi-Fi could stealthily configure the manufacturer DMC to gain permanent remote control over the garage door. Additionally, although some manufacturer DMCs include mechanisms to control third-party DMCs, these mechanisms are flawed without proper cross-DMC management protocols. For instance, the Abode smart hub, which manages access to its HomeKit channel, can be compromised by a user with temporary access, even after the right has been revoked through the manufacturer channel.

### Mitigating Codema
Given the significant impact of Codema, finding effective protections is imperative. We introduce Channel Guard (CGuard), a lightweight access control framework for cross-DMC security management. The core idea is to have a centralized access control framework in the device to oversee and govern the accessibility of all DMCs. Manufacturers can easily integrate CGuard into their firmware to ensure no DMC is left in an unexpected accessibility status.

We implemented CGuard and deployed it on a proof-of-concept smart LED light built on Raspberry Pi 3b, supporting multiple DMCs. Our evaluation shows that the prototype eliminates the Codema risk and works properly with mainstream DMCs like Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa. To evaluate usability and practicality, we conducted a user study, which showed that CGuard is highly acceptable and enhances the security and privacy of smart homes. We make the code publicly available on GitHub [15] and discuss a clean-slate design for multiple-DMC IoT to fully solve Codema through joint efforts across DMC providers and device manufacturers.

### Contributions
- **New Understanding**: Our research reveals a new category of security-critical weaknesses in today’s IoT designs, where multiple disjointed DMCs are integrated without proper coordination. We demonstrate that such weaknesses expose many IoT devices to realistic security risks with serious consequences.
- **New Technical Solutions**: Based on our understanding, we designed a new access-control framework (CGuard) to mitigate Codema risks. Our approach can be easily adopted by manufacturers, working well with existing systems like HomeKit. We implemented and demonstrated the efficacy and usability of CGuard, and open-sourced our prototype. This new technique will enhance the security quality of both existing and future IoT devices.

## 2 Device Management Channels
On an IoT device, the user console, IoT cloud, hub, and on-device software stack together form the DMC, allowing the user to manage the device. In this section, we explain the operations of popular DMCs integrated into mainstream IoT devices and the security policies they support.

### 2.1 Manufacturer DMCs
Each manufacturer provides its own DMC (m-DMC) to control its products. m-DMCs typically have one of the following architectures:

- **Cloud-based Architecture**: Many manufacturers run a backend cloud service to support their mobile apps and enable remote control. Commands issued through the manufacturer app are forwarded to the cloud, authenticated, and then delivered to the device.
- **Local-Control Architecture**: Devices can be paired with the manufacturer app through BLE or home Wi-Fi, establishing a connection for receiving commands directly from the user.
- **Hub-based DMC**: Devices are connected to a hub through local communication protocols (e.g., BLE, Z-Wave, Zigbee). The hub relays messages between the device and the manufacturer cloud.

### 2.2 Third-Party DMCs
- **HomeKit DMC**: HomeKit is Apple’s framework for configuring and controlling smart-home devices. It has been widely adopted and integrates with various devices.
- **Zigbee and Z-Wave DMCs**: These are popular third-party frameworks that allow devices to communicate and be controlled through compatible hubs.
- **Smart-Speaker DMCs**: These frameworks, such as Amazon Alexa, allow voice-activated control of IoT devices.

These DMCs, while providing flexibility and convenience, also introduce significant security challenges when not properly coordinated.
