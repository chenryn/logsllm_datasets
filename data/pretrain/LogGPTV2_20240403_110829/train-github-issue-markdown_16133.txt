As a user, I would like support for resource versioning so it is possible to
get the benefits of caching with the ability to refresh changes.
Implementation option #1
* * *
Automatic versioning with file timestamps e.g. /resources/main.123456789.css
Implementation option #2
* * *
Manual versioning with version number e.g. /resources/version-1.0.0/main.css
Both options would require ResourceHttpRequestHandler to strip out the version
number from the request URI to obtain the "real" resource path. In addition, a
view helper function or tag would be needed to generate versioned URLs e.g.
 might generate
http://localhost:8080/app/resources/main.123456789.css.
