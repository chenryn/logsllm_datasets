User: How to use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor Docker containers?
Assistant: Here are some basic steps to monitor Docker containers with Prometheus and Grafana: 1. Install and configure Docker Make sure you have installed and configured Docker, detailed instructions for this process can be found on the Docker official website. 2. Install and configure Prometheus Prometheus is an open source, reliable, and easily scalable monitoring tool. Installing and configuring Prometheus is very simple, you can refer to the official documentation for installation. 3. Configure Prometheus to monitor Docker containers Edit the Prometheus configuration file prometheus.yml and add the following content to monitor containers from Docker: ``` scrape_configs: - job_name: "docker" static_configs: - targets: ['docker-host:9323'] ` `` Here, "docker-host" is your Docker host IP. Then restart the Prometheus service. 4. Install and configure Grafana Grafana is a visualization tool that provides dashboards and query functions for graphical display. Installing and configuring Grafana is very simple, you can refer to the official documentation for installation. 5. Configure Grafana to obtain data from Prometheus In Grafana, add a data source and select Prometheus as the data source. Enter the URL of Prometheus in Prometheus URL. Then click the "Save and Test" button to ensure that Grafana can obtain data from Prometheus and connect successfully. 6. Add a dashboard and create metrics In Grafana, click the "Create Dashboard" button to create a new dashboard. Add a new data source and select the Prometheus data source. Enter the following indicators when creating a dashboard: - Container CPU usage ``` rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{image!=""}[1m]) * 100 ``` - Container Memory usage ``` container_memory_usage_bytes / on (instance) node_memory_MemTotal * 100 ``` 7. Preview the dashboard through Grafana You can preview the dashboard in Grafana at any time and get useful information about Docker container monitoring. That's it for the basic steps to monitor Docker containers with Prometheus and Grafana. You can use these tools to monitor other applications or services.
