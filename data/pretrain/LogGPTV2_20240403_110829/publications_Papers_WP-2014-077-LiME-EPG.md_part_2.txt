# Articles Gatherer and Information Enrichment

## 1. Introduction
The system gathers articles for each category (TV series and soccer games) to enrich the content. The information is collected from external sources through APIs, RSS feeds, or HTML scrapers, and then published to a central message queue. Each news article is sent to an annotation module, which uses two external services to retrieve entities in the content and link them with Linked Open Data (LOD) concepts. The annotated content is attached to a new message and published in the central queue. This component manages the selection of eligible programs to be annotated and enriched.

## 2. Data Model Construction
To store both MEO EPG and news article information, the data model must also represent the current un-enriched MEO EPG. The EPG describes several channels, each transmitting hundreds of TV programs. These programs have basic data such as title, description, and broadcast time. Programs can be transmitted repeatedly on any channel and may have contextual meaning with other TV programs. For example, a TV program may belong to a specific season of a series, as indicated in the title (e.g., "How I Met Your Mother S1 Ep. 15").

Since the MEO EPG is based on SAPO EPG, and we only have access to the latter, our study was conducted using SAPO EPG.

### 2.1 Internet Information
The information extracted from the internet varies by source and can change over time. For example, each news article has a title, but it may not have a subtitle, depending on the source. The model needs to be flexible and generic enough to accept any news article source while representing the information they provide.

We analyzed each principal source, identified the main attributes, and considered the structure of SAPO EPG and the characteristics of each program. We also studied a set of internet sources providing content on soccer, TV series, movies, and soap operas. Table 1 compares the information available in RSS feeds and HTML pages.

## 3. EPG+ Data Model
Figure 4 shows the final EPG+ data model developed for the system. It supports both enriched and non-enriched TV programs and is oriented towards TV programs, unlike SAPO EPG. It provides a new level of contextualization between the same programs with different broadcasts and a new structure that supports the identification of TV series associated with seasons and episodes.

### 3.1 Implementation
Given the system's characteristics, we used JBoss AS 15 and ESB 16, which encapsulate and provide a wide variety of enterprise-level technology services useful for our implementation (e.g., web services, messaging services, persistence). The use of these proven technologies lends robustness to our system, endowing it with a high level of tolerance to changes and adaptability to new sources or features.

In this section, we detail the implementation of the most important modules depicted in Figure 3.

#### 3.1.1 EPG Harvester
The EPG Harvester component is prepared to request, receive, and handle data from SAPO EPG every six hours. To reduce data redundancy, we implemented the Polling Consumer pattern. When the System Controller verifies that the data in the EPG+ is outdated, it requests the EPG Harvester to start its harvesting with the desired time interval and waits for the response with the new EPG information. Our system is flexible enough to accommodate the possibility of adding or switching the EPG data source. To allow such flexibility, we used JAX-Web Services in the construction of our System Controller, providing it with an interface to request the update of the EPG for each source.

Every interval hour, the system starts the processes to gather the most recent news articles from all external sources (soccer and TV series). Any particular source can publish its news articles at any time, and the system must gather each article as soon as possible. The solution we implemented for this situation is based on the Publish-Subscriber Channel pattern using a JMS (Java Messaging Service) queue for communication. Each Internet content extraction module retrieves the news articles from the source, maps it into a message object, and publishes it to the JMS queue CentralQ. To complete the pattern, when a TV program is sent to the Program Enrichment module to be enriched, a consumer is created which reads from the CentralQ the news articles and proceeds with the enrichment process. To optimize this process, we implemented the Selective Consumer pattern, which only reads the message objects matching a set of given criteria. The EPG Harvester and System Controller components also implement the Content Enricher pattern, which allows the augmentation of data, e.g., when adding a news article to an already existing un-enriched TV program.

## 4. Evaluation
We performed several types of evaluations of our system: validation of the EPG+ data model, evaluation of the classification and enrichment of TV programs.

### 4.1 Data Model
The data model evaluation is split into two different processes: 1) functional validation with system usage; and 2) data model support for new external sources.

#### 4.1.1 Functional Validation
Functional validation aims to assess whether the data model can support all of the system’s functionality. Table 2 presents some counting results regarding the data in the EPG+ database at the time of writing this document.

| Type            | Count  |
|-----------------|--------|
| Enriched Programs | 141    |
| Classified Programs | 1537  |
| Total Programs  | 1697   |
| Broadcasts      | 6393   |
| TV Series       | 46     |
| Extra Infos     | 1026   |
| O Jogo          | 519    |
| Mais Futebol    | 292    |
| Sapo Desporto   | 102    |
| TV Prime        | 111    |
| Sllex           | 3      |

With a total of 1697 different TV programs and over 6300 different broadcasts, this indicates that each TV program is transmitted an average of four times. Since our model is oriented to TV programs and each one has a list of broadcasts, it is possible to reduce information redundancy and have a new contextualization over time of broadcasts. It also stores 46 TV series, which is possible since the model can represent a TV series with its different seasons and respective episodes. This is a major improvement in the contextualization of each episode and also allows future new enrichments oriented to entire seasons or series. Finally, all the news articles extracted from the predefined sources were successfully stored, and the relations to their respective TV programs established. With each program having a list of enrichments (extraInfo field), it is possible to maintain a history line of news articles associated with a specific program, and therefore, if the TV program has a new broadcast, it is possible to access previous enrichments.

#### 4.1.2 Support for New External Sources
For the validation of the data model support for new external sources, we checked if it could represent information from a new category that was not considered during the definition: Music. We chose two sources of news articles for this category: MTV and SAPO Músicas. Table 3 shows the information fields each source provides and the comparison with the EPG+ data model.

| Source         | Title | Summary | Description | Source | Date | Rating | Article Link | Image Link | Video Link |
|----------------|-------|---------|-------------|--------|------|--------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Sapo Músicas   |   •   |    •    |      •      |   •    |  •   |   NA   |      •       |     •      |     •      |
| MTV            |   •   |    •    |      •      |   •    |  •   |   •    |      •       |     •      |     •      |
| EPG+ Data Model |   •   |    •    |      •      |   •    |  •   |   NA   |      •       |     •      |     •      |

**Legend:**
- • - contains
- NA - Not Applicable

This validation consisted of a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the news articles provided from the two chosen sources to check if the data model could represent all the information. The only field that our data model did not support was the rating. This field was discarded during the construction of the model. Even without running the system to enrich data of TV programs in the EPG using these two news sources, we have good reasons to believe, based on the previous analysis, that our data model will be capable of capturing all the information that a news source may provide.

### 4.2 Enrichment
To assess the quality of the enrichment process, we needed to collect enough data. We used a different dataset built over two weeks in early June 2013. The current set has a total of 36 enriched TV programs with a total of 228 different news articles associated. The analysis process allowed us to verify the true and false positive enrichments, i.e., the enrichments that are correctly related to the TV program and the ones that were wrongly associated by some misleading entity. During this evaluation, we verified that nearly 50% of the news articles extracted were associated with a TV program in each enrichment process. With a total of 36 TV programs, 228 news articles, 155 True Positive enrichments, and 73 False Positive enrichments, we reach the following conclusions:

- Approximately 68% (155/228) of enrichments are correct, with 155 news articles associated with the respective TV program.
- There is a high percentage, approximately 32% (73/228), of false positive enrichments, which led us to analyze their cause. They were originated from the enrichment of soccer games and caused by two determinant factors:
  - The dataset corresponds to early June, which coincides with the end of the season of almost all soccer competitions. Because of this, national teams played several games, either as friendly matches or as part of international competitions. Also, it is the period when teams start their player transfers, and the majority of the news articles are focused on that subject. These news articles often mentioned the country where the players will be playing for the next season, and this is how the connection between the television program and the news articles is made.
  - The lack of contextualization that each program of the EPG+ has, since there is a national team for each sport type. It is possible to have two different games where the national team of Portugal will be playing, but where each game is from a different sport type. Even with this error in the enrichment, PT Innovations stakeholders considered that the 32% of false positives were acceptable since the news articles will be stored and correctly annotated and can be used by future systems.

## 5. Future Work
Despite the positive results, improvements can be considered for future work. To have better disambiguation between similar TV programs and to improve the enrichment, we believe that a semantic solution should be implemented to give extra contextual knowledge to the EPG+. The exploration of Linked Data, introducing a semantic enrichment, can enhance the EPG+ to a new level of experience and depth of information, enabling browsing over related information and background. One important component that could be improved is the gathering of news articles. As stated before, the information retrieval is done by fetching HTML pages, which are susceptible to change. The implementation of a dynamic information gathering from internet sources would improve the quality of the enrichments. Finally, PT Innovations will integrate this system with its home-TV set-top box-based MEO service.

## 6. Conclusions
We have presented and detailed a possible solution to enrich the information of TV programs in the current EPG of MEO. We do this in two different ways: by gathering data from news articles and by incorporating information from the web of Linked Data. This second approach provides an open door to further improvements of the enrichment of the EGP information and its contextualization, namely resorting to Semantic Web technologies. The implementation of our system based on enterprise solutions and technologies allowed us to have a prototype that is able to adapt itself to new sources of data or expand its enrichment to other categories. The next step is to implement the integration of the EPG+ system with the current MEO service and then provide the enriched TV service to MEO clients.
