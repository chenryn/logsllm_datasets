 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?** Feature
**What is the current behavior?**
The `ref` attribute passed to a DOM node can be either a callback or a
`RefObject`, but not both. Sometimes, that's exactly what's required: for
example, a library like react-pose demands ref forwarding to work with a React
Component, but you'd also like to retain a reference to the _same_ parent DOM
node within that component itself for a different reason. It's often not
possible to nest DOM nodes to achieve a similar thing using two different ref
attributes as that breaks layout.
Here's a link to a naive attempt to achieve this:

I'm not surprised this doesn't work as there's no reason for the parent ref
callback to fire, but I don't know how else to go about it.
**What is the expected behavior?**
The callback provides the component with its own reference to the parent DOM
node, whilst also providing it to the parent component via the passed
`RefObject`.
