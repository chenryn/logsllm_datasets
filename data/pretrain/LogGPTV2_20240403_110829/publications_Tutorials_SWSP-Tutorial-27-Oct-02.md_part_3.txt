Introduction
E-services (Web Services) have been are
announced as the next wave of Internet-based
business applications that will dramatically change
the use of the Internet1.
While in some cases Web services may be utilized
in an isolated form, it is natural to expect that Web
services will be integrated as part of processes2
(Web processes).

Web Services
Discovery and Integration
To compose a process it is necessary to discover
and integrate a set of Web services.
Web Service Discovery
Web Service Integration
80
Web Services
Discovery and Integration
Web Services must be located (Discovery) that
might contain the desired functionality, operational
metrics, and interfaces needed to carry out the
realization of a given task.
Once the desired Web Services have been found,
mechanisms are needed to facilitate the resolution of
structural and semantic differences (Integration).
This is because the heterogeneous Web services
found in the first step need to interoperate with other
components present in a workflow host.
81
Discovery
New Requirements
In traditional workflow processes the selection of
tasks is made from a repository.
Contains tens to a few hundreds of tasks.
The selection is humanly manageable.
In Web processes.
Potentially thousands of Web services are available.
It is impossible for a designer to manually browse
through all of the Web services available and select the
most suitable ones.
Requires the analysis of Web services QoS.
82
Discovery
New Requirements
The autonomy of Web services does not allow for
designer to identify their operational metrics at
design time.
Nevertheless, when composing a process it is
indispensable to inquire the Web services
operational metrics.
Operational metrics characterize the Quality of
Service (QoS) that Web services exhibit when
invoked.

85
Integration
New Requirements
When Web services are put together
Their interfaces need to interoperate.
Structural and semantic heterogeneity need to be resolved*.
Structural heterogeneity exists because Web services
use different data structures and class hierarchies to
define the parameters of their interfaces.
Semantic heterogeneity considers the intended meaning
of the terms employed in labeling interface parameters.
The data that is interchanged among Web services has
to be understood.

Our Approach
We rely on the use of ontologies to describe
Web services and their interfaces.
Interfaces parameters can be specified with
distinct ontological concepts.
We use a QoS model to describe operational
metrics.

Semantic Specification
Web Services
Specification
The importance of Web services has been recognize by
the academia and by commercial organizations.
Several efforts are being carried to develop a
specification language for Web services.
Two main approaches have been proposed.
One of the approaches uses declarative and structured data
based purely on syntax, such as WSDL1 and XLANG2.
A second approach provides a semantic orientation to the
description of Web services. This is the case in the DAML-S3
specification.

Web Services
Specification
As with WSMF*, our approach to Web Process
composition is not dependent on the method chosen to
specify Web services.
Therefore, any of the specification languages mentioned
previously can be employed.
For the system that we have developed we have
selected the DAML-S specification; more precisely, we
use the Service Profile ontology.
The service profile ontology describes the functionality of
a Web service.

We use DAML-S to specify Web services.

Operational Metrics Specification
Operational metrics are described using a QoS model
represented with a suitable ontology.

In their simplest form, the input and output parameters can be

represented by data components.
Web Services
Interfaces
To enhance the integration of tasks and Web services,
workflow components need to have their inputs and outputs
associated with ontological concepts (classes).
This will facilitate the resolution of structural and semantic
heterogeneity.

Since there is a strong analogy between the attributes and data classes of

the association is facilitated.

Mapping Interfaces with
Ontological Concepts
To enhance the discovery and integration of
Web services, it is necessary to increase the
description of their interfaces.
One solution is to associate the interfaces with
ontological concepts.
An ontology is a specification of a representational vocabulary
for a shared domain of discourse.
105
What is an Ontology
An ontology may take a variety of forms.
But necessarily it will include a vocabulary of terms,
and some specification of their meaning.
This includes definitions and an indication of how concepts
are inter-related which collectively impose a structure on
the domain and constrain the possible interpretations of
terms.
The goal is to create an agreed-upon vocabulary
and semantic structure for exchanging information
about that domain.
