### Abstract
The multi-Gbps throughput potential of 60 GHz wireless interfaces makes them an attractive technology for next-generation gigabit WLANs. To enhance coverage and improve resilience to human-body blockage, beamsteering with high-gain directional antennas is becoming an integral part of 60 GHz radios. However, the real-world performance of these state-of-the-art radios in typical indoor environments has not been extensively explored in open literature.

In this paper, we address the following open questions:
- How do these radios perform in indoor line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) locations?
- How sensitive is performance to factors such as node orientation or placement?
- How robust is performance to human-body blockage and mobility?

Our measurement results from a real office setting, using a first-of-its-kind experimental platform called Presto, show that, contrary to conventional perception, state-of-the-art 60 GHz radios perform well even in NLOS locations, in the presence of human-body blockage and LOS mobility. While their performance is affected by node (or more precisely, antenna array) orientation, simply using a few more antenna arrays and dynamically selecting among them shows potential to address this issue. The implications of these observations are in lowering the barriers to their adoption in next-generation gigabit WLANs.

### 1. Introduction
Emerging radios in the unlicensed 57-66 GHz spectrum, colloquially known as "60 GHz" radios, offer the opportunity to enable throughput-intensive, short-range wireless networks and new services such as sync-and-go file transfers. By leveraging a wide channel bandwidth (âˆ¼2 GHz), these radios can support over-the-air multi-Gbps data transfers. However, 60 GHz radios need high-gain directional communication to leverage their throughput potential at distances greater than a few meters. Additionally, signals at these millimeter-wavelength frequencies are blocked by human bodies and attenuated by obstacles (e.g., walls).

To overcome these challenges, state-of-the-art 60 GHz radios use high-gain, switched-beam directional antennas. High antenna gain helps increase the coverage range and overcome attenuation by obstacles, while the ability to switch beams at runtime (i.e., beamsteering) can help steer signals around human-body blockage. A natural follow-up question is whether it is feasible to build general-purpose, gigabit wireless LANs using these state-of-the-art 60 GHz radios. Unlike existing use of this technology restricted to point-to-point, LOS scenarios, is it possible to extend its applicability to environments with NLOS blockage from walls/cubicles, human-body blockage, and user mobility?

To determine this feasibility, we measure 60 GHz link performance in an indoor enterprise environment. Through experiments in a realistic setting, this paper answers the following set of basic and important questions:
- What is the effect of LOS or NLOS node location on performance?
- How sensitive is the performance to node (or more precisely, antenna array) orientation?
- How robust is the performance to human-body blockage and mobility?

To our knowledge, we are not aware of any other network-layer measurements that address all these generic questions in the indoor context. Prior efforts in this domain focused mainly on PHY-layer channel characterization.

### 2. Background
#### Need for Directionality & Beamsteering
With omni-directional antennas, 60 GHz radios cannot support distances greater than a few meters. The millimeter wavelengths at these frequencies lead to reduced antenna aperture areas, which in turn lead to higher path loss and susceptibility to blockage.

Antenna directionality can be used to overcome these limitations since directionality is inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength. The millimeter wavelengths also enable antenna arrays with tens of elements on a single die, promoting beamsteering.

#### Antenna Realization for Beamsteering
Beamsteering is typically enabled by switched-beam directional antennas, which provide a good trade-off among available antenna technologies. They are less bulky than a collection of fixed-beam antennas and simpler to implement than adaptive-beam antennas. A common way to realize switched-beam antennas is by using phased array antennas, which consist of an array of antenna elements. The signals sent to these elements are weighted in both magnitude and phase to reinforce energy in a particular direction, producing a high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) in the desired direction.

To realize beamsteering, several such beam patterns are generated with a phased array antenna, and a specific beam pattern is dynamically chosen during runtime operation. Practical realizations in state-of-the-art 60 GHz radios use square or rectangular arrays of elements in planar patch form, typically polarized in the horizontal or vertical direction, with a limited angular range (< 180 degrees) over which beams can be steered.

These characteristics raise questions about how sensitive performance will be to real-world factors like relative node location, antenna array orientation, temporary blockage by human bodies, and user mobility. These questions motivate our measurements in an indoor enterprise environment. Due to the unavailability of 60 GHz wireless interfaces for PCs, we first build a new experimental platform called Presto.

### 3. The Presto Platform
Presto currently contains two simplex 60 GHz links. The nodes hosting the 60 GHz transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) are 2.8 GHz quad-core general-purpose PCs running Linux. The wireless TX and RX connect to the PCs through customized HDMI interface boards (HIB). 

#### 60 GHz Wireless Transceivers
We use the Vizio XWH200 wireless HDMI TX-RX pairs, which can support a peak MAC throughput of 3 Gbps (at the peak PHY rate of 3.8 Gbps) and are based on Silicon Image, Inc.'s 2nd-generation WirelessHD 60 GHz radios. These devices are traditionally designed to support uncompressed HD video transfer from a Blu-ray player to an HDTV. While the 60 GHz MAC and PHY specifications have sufficiently matured, the protocol adaptation layer (PAL) to interface the TCP/IP networking stack with 60 GHz transceivers is still under development. Consequently, only an HDMI interface is provided. Our first challenge is to interface these transceivers with the PC to support IP-over-wireless-HDMI packet data communications.

#### HDMI-Interface Board (HIB)
To enable IP-over-wireless-HDMI, we use a HDMI interface board (HIB) that interfaces with the PC over the PCIe bus. The HIB is an Altera Aria II GX FPGA development board with Microtronix HDMI transmitter and receiver daughter-cards. The HIB has two HDMI interfaces, one for transmit and one for receive. We consider two design options for the placement of the IP-to-HDMI conversion functionality on the FPGA:
1. Placing full functionality in the FPGA.
2. Splitting the functionality between the FPGA and the host processor.

In the first approach, the FPGA can hide all the complexity of IP-over-HDMI and expose an Ethernet interface to the networking stack. While this enables ease of experimentation, sufficient processing power and memory are needed on the FPGA to support multi-Gbps speeds, which can increase its cost significantly. In the second approach, the FPGA efficiently transfers raw data (in bytes) between the HDMI interface and the PC's RAM. The software on the host CPU can then interface with the RAM, create the abstraction of a network interface, and implement data-link layer functionality (like framing). By offloading most of the functionality to the host PC, such an approach is cost-effective but needs fast CPUs to enable network processing at multi-Gbps speeds. Presto adopts the second approach to keep the FPGA simple and cost-effective, while relying on the ready availability of fast CPUs.

#### FPGA Logic
The software on the FPGA uses scatter-gather DMA (sgdma) logic to take data spread over memory and transfer it over PCIe to or from the Avalon memory-mapped bus on the FPGA. Additional logic transfers data between the Avalon bus and the HDMI transmit/receive ports. This approach enables high-speed transfers from RAM over PCIe to the HDMI ports.

To transfer binary IP traffic over the Vizio adapters, they are modified to use RGB mode to avoid data corruption due to color-space conversion (to YCrCb). This allows us to measure data corruption due to channel-induced errors alone. Among the RGB lines, we use the R-line to indicate that "valid" data from the PC is available on the G- and B-lines. This control-data split is needed since HDMI video data, unlike IP traffic, is always flowing on the connection. This split means that our current prototype can provide at most 2/3 of the raw capacity supported by these 60 GHz radios, i.e., 2/3 of 3 Gbps. We plan to reduce this overhead in future versions of Presto.

#### Kernel-Space Device Driver
To expose a byte-level file abstraction (primarily for ease and efficiency), the FPGA works in unison with a custom-built Linux device driver that hides the complexity of transferring data directly over the PCIe bus by exposing a standard POSIX API (i.e., open, read, write, close system calls). Once the driver is loaded, a `/dev/sgdma` device is created.

As a first case-study with Presto, we measure uni-directional (simplex), 60 GHz wireless link performance in an indoor enterprise environment.

### 4. Experimental Methodology
We conduct our measurements in a typical indoor enterprise environment with offices, cubicles, and corridors. Figure 2 shows our testbed deployed using Presto nodes. We consider four scenarios in eleven different TX, RX locations to capture different environmental effects, as summarized in Table 4(a).

To account for sensitivity to the TX/RX antenna array orientation, we divide the 360-degree X-Y plane into four orientations and vary them for each TX/RX location. This results in 16 TX/RX orientation combinations for each TX/RX location. We index each combination in Table 4(b) to ease our result description.
