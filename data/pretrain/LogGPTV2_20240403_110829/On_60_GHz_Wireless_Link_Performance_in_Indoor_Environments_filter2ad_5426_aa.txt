Abstract. The multi-Gbps throughput potential of 60 GHz wireless in-
terfaces make them an attractive technology for next-generation gigabit
WLANs. For increased coverage, and improved resilience to human-body
blockage, beamsteering with high-gain directional antennas is emerging
to be an integral part of 60 GHz radios. However, the real-world perfor-
mance of these state-of-the-art radios in typical indoor environments has
not previously been explored well in open literature.
To this end, in this paper, we address the following open questions:
how do these radios perform in indoor line-of-sight(LOS) and non-line-
of-sight (NLOS) locations? how sensitive is performance to factors such
as node orientation or placement? how robust is performance to human-
body blockage and mobility? Our measurement results from a real oﬃce
setting, using a ﬁrst-of-its-kind experimental platform (called Presto),
show that, contrary to conventional perception, state-of-the-art 60 GHz
radios perform well even in NLOS locations, in the presence of human-
body blockage and LOS mobility. While their performance is aﬀected
by node (or more precisely, antenna array) orientation, simply using a
few more antenna arrays and dynamically selecting amongst them shows
potential to address this issue. The implications of these observations
is in lowering the barriers to their adoption in next-generation gigabit
WLANs.

Introduction
Emerging radios in the unlicensed 57-66 GHz spectrum (colloquially known
as “60 GHz” radios) [23,6,22,9,1] oﬀer the opportunity to enable throughput-
intensive, short-range wireless networks (e.g. [8]) and new services (such as sync-
and-go ﬁle transfers). By leveraging a wide channel bandwidth (∼2 GHz), these
radios can support over-the-air multi-Gbps data transfers. A caveat, however, is
that 60 GHz radios need high-gain directional communication to leverage their
throughput potential at distances greater than a few meters [4]. In addition,
signals at these millimeter-wavelength frequencies are blocked by human bodies
[3,20] and attenuated by obstacles (e.g. walls) (see Table III in [23]).
To overcome these challenges, state-of-the-art 60 GHz radios use high-gain,
switched-beam directional antennas [21,16]. High antenna gain helps increase

the coverage range and overcome attenuation by obstacles while the ability to
switch beams at run-time (i.e. beamsteering) can help steer signals “around”
human-body blockage. A natural follow-up question is whether it is feasible to
build general-purpose, gigabit wireless LANs using these state-of-the-art 60 GHz
radios? Unlike existing use of this technology restricted to point-to-point, LOS
scenarios [8,17,19], is it possible to extend its applicability to environments with
NLOS blockage from walls/cubicles, human-body blockage, and user mobility?
Towards determining this feasibility, we measure 60 GHz link performance in
an indoor enterprise environment. Through experiments in a realistic setting,
this paper answers the following set of basic and important questions: What is
the eﬀect of LOS or NLOS node location on performance? How sensitive is the
performance to node (or more precisely, antenna array) orientation? How robust
is the performance to human-body blockage and mobility? To our knowledge, we
are not aware of any other network-layer measurements that address all these
generic questions in the indoor context. Prior eﬀorts in this domain focused
mainly on PHY-layer channel characterization [23,3].
To conduct these measurements, due to the lack of availability of 60 GHz wire-
less interfaces for PCs, we build a ﬁrst-of-its-kind experimental platform called
Presto. Presto enables IP-over-60-GHz communication by leveraging commercial
oﬀ-the-shelf (COTS) 60 GHz wireless HDMI radios and interfacing them with
PCs via readily-available FPGAs.
In theory, high antenna gain can help overcome attenuation losses due to wall
or cubicle blockage. Further, multipath reﬂections in indoor environments could
present alternate paths that beamsteering can take advantage of in the pres-
ence of human-body blockage or while adapting to user mobility. We study how
eﬀective state-of-the-art 60 GHz radios are in dealing with these real-world situ-
ations. In particular, we make the following key observations: (1) 60 GHz radios
are able to overcome NLOS blockage due to walls and cubicles; their coverage
range is reduced relative to LOS scenarios but could still be enough to satisfy
the needs of dense WLANs. (2) Antenna array orientation has a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on performance even in the presence of indoor multipath reﬂections; mitigation
strategies that add to the single antenna array at each node and dynamically se-
lect amongst them show potential to address this issue. (3) Finally, beamsteering
is eﬀective in dealing with low levels of human-body blockage and LOS mobility
at walking speeds; existing implementations need to react faster in the presence
of high levels of dynamically-occurring human-body blockage.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Background on state-of-the-art
60 GHz radios and beamsteering is presented in §2. Our experimental platform,
Presto, is described in §3. §4 describes our experimental methodology and §5
presents our results and interpretations from our experiments. §6 concludes.
2 Background
Need for Directionality & Beamsteering: With omni-directional antennas,
60 GHz radios cannot support distances greater than a few meters (see Figure
On 60 GHz Wireless Link Performance in Indoor Environments
149
1 in [4]). The millimeter(mm) wavelengths at these frequencies lead to reduced
antenna aperture areas, which in turn lead to much higher path loss [6] and
susceptibility to blockage [20].
Fortunately, antenna directionality can be used to overcome these limitations
since directionality is inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength
(Chap. 15, [12]). The mm-wavelengths also enable antenna arrays with tens of
elements on a single die thus promoting beamsteering [13,14].
With the realization that directionality and beamsteering are essential, the
WirelessHD [2] and WiGig [22] speciﬁcations, as well as the IEEE 802.11ad draft
standard [9] for 60 GHz radios include the necessary mechanisms and protocol
support at the MAC and PHY layers (see further details in Appendix in [10]).
Antenna Realization for Beamsteering: Typically, beamsteering is enabled
by switched-beam directional antennas that provide a good trade-oﬀ among the
available antenna technologies; they are less bulky than a collection of ﬁxed-beam
antennas [15] and simpler to implement and incorporate than adaptive-beam
antennas [14]. A common way of realizing switched-beam antennas is by using
phased array antennas. Phased array antennas consist of an array of antenna
elements, the signals sent to which are weighted in both magnitude and phase.
The applied weights help reinforce energy in a particular direction, thereby pro-
ducing an antenna beam pattern with high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) over an
omni pattern in the desired direction contributing to a directional/array gain.
To realize beamsteering, several such beam patterns are generated with a phased
), and a speciﬁc beam
array antenna such that they cover the entire azimuth (360
pattern is dynamically chosen from the available set during run-time operation.
Practical realizations in state-of-the-art 60 GHz radios use square or a rectan-
gular array of elements in planar patch form [7]. These planar patch arrays are
typically polarized in the horizontal or vertical direction (i.e. can steer beams
in one of these directions), and have a limited angular range (< 180 degrees)
[16,21] over which beams can be steered. These characteristics raise questions
as to how sensitive performance will be to real-world factors like relative node
location, antenna array orientation, temporary blockage by human bodies and
user mobility? These questions motivate our measurements in an indoor enter-
prise environment. Due to the unavailability of 60 GHz wireless interfaces for
PCs, we ﬁrst build a new experimental platform called Presto.

3 The Presto Platform
Presto currently contains two simplex 60 GHz links (see Figure 1(a)). The nodes
hosting the 60 GHz transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) are 2.8 GHz quad-core
general-purpose PCs running Linux. The wireless TX and RX connect to the
PCs through customized HDMI interface boards (HIB). Figure 1(b) shows a
picture of the HIB, and Figure 1(c) shows the 60 GHz transceivers.
60 GHz Wireless Transceivers: We use the Vizio XWH200 wireless HDMI
TX-RX pairs [21]. These TX-RX pairs can support a peak MAC throughput of

3Gbps (at the peak PHY rate of 3.8Gbps) and are based on Silicon Image, Inc.’s
2nd-generation WirelessHD 60 GHz radios [18] (see further details in Appendix
in [10]). These devices are traditionally designed to support uncompressed HD
video transfer from a Blue-ray player to an HDTV. While the 60 GHz MAC and
PHY speciﬁcations have suﬃciently matured [9,2], the protocol adaptation layer
(PAL) to interface the TCP/IP networking stack with 60 GHz transceivers is
still under development [9,2]. Consequently, only an HDMI interface is provided.
Hence, our ﬁrst challenge is to interface these transceivers with the PC to support
IP-over-wireless-HDMI packet data communications.
HDMI-Interface Board (HIB): To enable IP-over-wireless-HDMI, we use a
HDMI interface board (HIB) that interfaces with the PC over the PCIe bus. The
HIB is an Altera Aria II GX FPGA development board [5] with Microtronix [11]
HDMI transmitter and receiver daughter-cards. The HIB has two HDMI inter-
faces, one for transmit and one for receive.We consider two design options for
the placement of the IP-to-HDMI conversion functionality on the FPGA: (a)
placing full functionality in the FPGA, (b) splitting the functionality between
the FPGA and the host processor.
In the ﬁrst approach, the FPGA can hide all the complexity of IP-over-HDMI
and expose an Ethernet interface to the networking stack. While this enables
ease of experimentation, suﬃcient processing power and memory are needed on
the FPGA in order to support multi-Gbps speeds, which can increase its cost
signiﬁcantly. In the second approach, the FPGA eﬃciently transfers raw data
(in bytes) between the HDMI interface and the PC’s RAM. The software on
the host CPU can then interface with the RAM, create the abstraction of a
network interface and implement data-link layer functionality (like framing). By
oﬄoading most of the functionality to the host PC, such an approach is cost-
eﬀective. But it needs fast CPUs to enable network processing at multi-Gbps
speeds. Presto adopts the second approach to keep the FPGA simple and cost-
eﬀective, while relying on the ready availability of fast CPUs.
FPGA Logic: The software on the FPGA uses scatter-gather DMA (sgdma)
logic to take data spread over memory and transfer it over PCIe to or from
the Avalon memory-mapped bus on the FPGA. Additional logic transfers data

between the Avalon bus and the HDMI transmit/receive ports. Such an approach
enables high-speed transfers from RAM over PCIe to the HDMI ports.
To transfer binary IP traﬃc over the Vizio adapters, they are modiﬁed to use
RGB mode to avoid data corruption due to color-space conversion (to YCrCb).
This allows us to measure data corruption due to channel-induced errors alone.
Among the RGB lines, we use the R-line to indicate that “valid” data from the
PC is available on the G- and B-lines. This control-data split is needed since,
HDMI video data, unlike IP traﬃc, is always ﬂowing on the connection. This split
means that our current prototype can provide at most 2/3 of the raw capacity
supported by these 60 GHz radios, i.e. 2/3 of 3 Gbps. We plan to reduce this
overhead in future versions of Presto.
Kernel-space Device Driver: To expose a byte-level ﬁle abstraction (pri-
marily for ease and eﬃciency), the FPGA works in unison with a custom-built
Linux device driver that hides the complexity of transferring data directly over
the PCIe bus by exposing a standard POSIX API (i.e. open, read, write, close
system calls). Once the driver is loaded, a /dev/sgdma device is created.
As a ﬁrst case-study with Presto, we measure uni-directional (simplex), 60
GHz wireless link performance in an indoor enterprise environment.
4 Experimental Methodology
We conduct our measurements in a typical indoor enterprise environment with
oﬃces, cubicles, and corridors. Figure 2 shows our testbed deployed using
Presto nodes. We consider four scenarios in eleven diﬀerent TX, RX locations to
capture diﬀerent environmental eﬀects, as summarized in Table 4(a).
To account for sensitivity to the TX/RX antenna array orientation, we divide
the 360 degree X-Y plane into four orientations and vary them for each TX/RX
location. This results in 16 TX/RX orientation combinations for each TX/RX
location. We index each combination in Table 4(b) to ease our result description.
