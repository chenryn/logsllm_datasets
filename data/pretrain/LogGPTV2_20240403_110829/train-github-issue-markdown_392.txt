The comment for the `P521` function partially references another function. Specifically, at line 373 of the source code located at [this link](http://golang.org/src/pkg/crypto/elliptic/elliptic.go?s=11710:11727#L364), the comment should be updated to read as follows:

```go
// P521 returns a Curve which implements P-521 (see FIPS 186-3, section D.2.5)
```

This change will ensure that the documentation is accurate and clearly specifies the standard and section being referenced.
