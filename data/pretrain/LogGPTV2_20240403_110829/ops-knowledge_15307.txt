Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system. The DataNode is receiving blocks of size 67108864 from various IP addresses and the FSNamesystem is adding these blocks to the blockMap. Additionally, the FSNamesystem is allocating blocks for various tasks. Finally, the PacketResponders are terminating.
