企业安全架构概述
An Introduction of Enterprise Security Architecture
北海之帝为忽，南海之帝为倏，中央
之帝为混沌。忽与倏时相与遇于混沌之地，
混沌待之甚善。忽与倏谋报混沌之德，曰：
“人皆有七窍，以视听食息，此独无有，尝
试凿之。”日凿一窍，七日而混沌死。

如何保证与战略和业务一致性
•
如何体现价值交付
•
如何评估投入产出
•
大系统的复杂度
•
一处失效，全盘皆输？

管理和技术脱节？
•
技术应用和运维失效
系统论与系统工程
＊SYSTEM APPROACH AND SYSTEM ENGINEERING
万事万物皆为系统
系统的定义：由若干要素以一定结构形式联结构
成的具有某种功能的有机整体。在这个定义中包
括了系统、要素、结构、功能四个概念。
整体性，结构性，关联性，动态平衡性，时序性
系统工程：通过系统解析的方法，分析要素与要
素、要素与系统、系统与环境三方面的关系，优
化解决问题。

企业架构、管理体系、与企业安全架构
＊EA, ISMS AND ESA
企业架构 (Enterprise Architecture) ：
企业架构是构成组织的所有关键元素和关系的综合描述。企业架构框架（EAF）是一个描述企业架
构方法的蓝图，一种通过系统工程，综合全面的解析企业要素和关系，并改善问题的实践性方法。
分层结构：
企业业务架构（EBA，Enterprise Business Architecture）：组织结构、岗位职能和业务流程
企业信息架构（EIA，Enterprise Information Architecture）：数据结构和关系
企业应用架构（EAA，Enterprise Application Architecture）：应用系统
企业技术架构（ETA，Enterprise Technical Architecture ）：基础设施
