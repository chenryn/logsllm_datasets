### Title: BlackHat Asia 2022: To Loot or Not to Loot? State-Nexus APTs Targeting the Online Entertainment Industry

The online entertainment industry has not traditionally been a high-profile target for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks. Historically, APT research has focused on the public sector, including government, military, and critical infrastructure. However, since 2020, security researchers have begun to highlight APT activities targeting the online entertainment sector. For example, TrendMicro's "Operation DRBControl" revealed that China-nexus APT groups, such as APT41 and APT27, had targeted gambling and betting entities.

This presentation will delve into the targeted APT attacks against online entertainment companies, which often possess substantial cash flows and large volumes of personal data. While many of these attacks were initially perceived as financially motivated due to the use of ransomware, our observations over the past few years indicate that espionage is also a significant driver.

We will analyze more than 20 targeted attack operations that TeamT5 has tracked since 2018. Our findings reveal technical connections between these attacks and well-known Chinese APT groups, including APT10 (aka menuPass), APT41 (aka Winnti, Amoeba), and APT27 (aka GreedyTaotie). The presentation will cover the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) employed by these APT groups, which include the use of well-known Chinese-origin malware such as PlugX, ZxShell, and shared tools like Hyperbro, PlugX2016, and CoinDrop. Additionally, some campaigns have deployed ransomware for double extortion purposes.

More importantly, these cases provide insight into China's strategic moves. We believe that these APT attacks are part of a broader initiative by the Chinese government. Following these intensive APT attacks, we have observed official efforts by China to purge the online entertainment and gambling industry. Our strategic intelligence suggests several possible scenarios, leading us to conclude that the ultimate goal of these APT attacks may be multifaceted and aligned with broader geopolitical objectives.
