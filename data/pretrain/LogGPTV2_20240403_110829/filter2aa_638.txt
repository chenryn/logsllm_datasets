### Writing Fiction to Tell the Truth
**By Richard Thieme**

Things are often not what they seem. This is a fact, but the truth can be distorted through images and words, sometimes due to careless thinking, but often as a result of policies implemented by the "national security state." This complex system, which originated during World War II, has continued to evolve and shape our understanding of reality.

The consequences of this shift are profound. During World War II, a regime of propaganda and censorship was established for strategic reasons. The government, for example, kept secret the frequent occurrences of debris and bodies washing up on the Atlantic coast due to U-boat activity. These secrets were well-kept with the cooperation of the media, which served as gateways to the "mind of society."

The Cold War further entrenched these practices. Propaganda and censorship became powerful tools in the global game of perception management. Information operations framed the thinking of both Americans and their perceived enemies, blurring the lines between them.

Under President Eisenhower, assisted by the Dulles brothers at the State Department and the CIA, covert operations such as the overthrow of Iran's Mossadegh and Argentina's Arbenz were conducted with plausible deniability. This set a precedent for future secret operations.

I once asked a historian at the NSA about historical events that we could discuss with a reasonable expectation of shared understanding. He replied, "Anything up to 1945," with a laugh, but he was serious.

The end of the Cold War did not bring an end to these policies. New technologies have enhanced the science of perception management. Cover stories interweave truths, half-truths, and lies, making it nearly impossible for the average citizen to discern what is real. The 9/11 attacks further accelerated this trend, and today, social media serve as conduits for spreading distorted truths.

Governmental secrecy has expanded dramatically, with more documents classified and more people granted clearances under the guise of a "need to know." This compartmentalization means that even within the intelligence community, many individuals do not have the full picture. They, too, must rely on public information to piece together the truth.

Paradoxically, the only way to tell the truth is through fiction. Movies, television, and books present narratives that, while sometimes true and sometimes not, create a shared narrative reinforced by repetition. As these stories permeate society, they bind us in a web of fabrications that seem real but serve other purposes.

A notable example is the TV series "24," which popularized the idea that torture is justified in a ticking bomb scenario. Policymakers have even cited "24" as if it were factual, using fiction to support the real-life decision that torture is an appropriate tool in covert operations. In reality, such scenarios are highly unlikely, but the show effectively convinced many Americans of the utility of torture.

This example illustrates the world of distortion, illusion, and misdirection in which we live. At Def Con, the Las Vegas security conference where I will speak for the 19th year, my talk is titled "Fiction is the Only Way to Tell the Truth."

Over a decade ago, a friend at the NSA advised me to write fiction if I wanted to discuss ethical considerations in intelligence. "It's the only way you can tell the truth," he said. This led to "Mind Games" (Duncan Long Publishing: 2010), a collection of stories that explore "non-consensual realities," such as the worlds of hackers and intelligence professionals.

In the first story, "Zero Day: Roswell," a dying intelligence professional lists "things we do that you don’t know." Because it was fiction, the details, written in 2006, could be dismissed by authoritative voices. Recently, a reader tweeted passages from the story alongside revelations from Edward Snowden, noting their alignment. However, Snowden had to go into exile for his disclosures, while I, as a mere fiction writer, remain here.

Another friend, an intelligence analyst at the NSA, read "Zero Day: Roswell" and called me, chuckling. "95% of this story isn’t fiction," he said, "but you have to know which parts to have the key to the code."

Readers often believed the fictional bits about Roswell aliens but overlooked the accurate details about technology. Without corroboration from authoritative sources, these assertions remained speculative and anomalous, never connecting to the "real."

One negative consequence of living in this national security state is the proliferation of "niches of truthiness," where internet-fed consumers accept everything without critical thinking. This has led to a decline in political discourse. Investigative journalism is waning, while the blogosphere explodes, allowing anyone to say anything. Followers then retweet, repost, and comment from bunkers of invincible ignorance, fostering distrust of official sources and common sense. The rise of angry, distrustful, and well-organized "thought vigilantes," mobilized by shout-show hosts and easy access to arms, is a concerning trend.

Do we need a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing?

After my speeches, I am often asked if I believe we went to the moon or have rovers on Mars. Many people, unsure of what to believe, are willing to believe anything. United in fear, they can be herded into digital corrals, moved without even noticing.

In a speech at the NSA before the Snowden revelations, I warned of the chilling effects of widespread intrusion and surveillance, and the lack of accountability to "we the people." Once Snowden revealed his findings, the discussion quickly shifted to high-level, secret spin strategies.

Empires sow the seeds of their own demise through internal dynamics. External events may catalyze this, but they are not the sole cause. The good news is that we have some control over our choices. The bad news is that history suggests we may not use that freedom wisely.
