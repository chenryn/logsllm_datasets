### Title: CnCHunter: An MITM Approach to Identifying Live CnC Servers

**Abstract:**
Identifying active Command and Control (CnC) servers is crucial for containing and combating botnets. However, this task is challenging due to several factors: CnC servers can frequently change locations to evade detection, use proprietary communication protocols, and often employ end-to-end encryption. Traditional methods typically involve first "learning" the malware's communication protocol and then scanning the Internet for live CnC servers. While these approaches have been useful, they are less effective against sophisticated malware that uses encryption or complex communication protocols, which are difficult to reverse engineer.

In this session, we introduce CnCHunter, a systematic tool designed to efficiently discover live CnC servers. The key innovation of our approach is the use of real, "activated" malware in a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) setup. This method allows CnCHunter to overcome the limitations of previous efforts, as the malware binary inherently knows how to communicate with its CnC server, even in the presence of encryption.

**Methodology:**
- **Sample Selection:** We randomly selected 50 IoT malware samples collected between 2017 and 2021.
- **Activation and Discovery:** CnCHunter was able to automatically activate 96% of the malware samples and dynamically identify their CnC servers.
- **Demonstration of Potential:** To further illustrate the effectiveness of our system, we activated an old Gafgyt malware sample and enabled it to communicate with a live CnC server from a recent sample of the same family. This experiment demonstrated that an older malware binary can be used to scan the Internet and find live CnC servers for the entire malware family.

**Conclusion:**
CnCHunter represents a significant advancement in the identification of live CnC servers. By leveraging the inherent communication capabilities of activated malware, our tool provides a robust and efficient solution for detecting and mitigating the threat posed by botnets.
