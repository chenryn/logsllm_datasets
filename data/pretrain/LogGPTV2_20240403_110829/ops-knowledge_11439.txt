User: How to enhance computer security and protect confidential information from being stolen?
Assistant: Here are a few suggestions for enhancing computer security: 1. Install the latest operating system and software updates - Make sure your computer system and software are up to date, as newer versions often fix known vulnerabilities and security issues. 2. Install an antivirus software program - Installing a strong antivirus software can keep your computer safe from malware, viruses, and other threats. 3. Strengthen your computer's passwords - use complex passwords that include combinations of numbers, letters, and symbols to protect your accounts and computer systems, and change passwords regularly. 4. Use a firewall - Install a firewall on your computer, it blocks unauthorized access and keeps your data safe. 5. Other suggestions - Turn off shared files and printers, and don't install software or run files from strangers. Buy products or pay bills using a secure website. Create a backup and restore plan at the same time, so that data will not be permanently damaged or lost in the event of an unexpected situation.
