Abstract 
In  February  2002,  more  than  50  leaders  in  the 
information  assurance  field  warned  the  President  of 
the United States of a national strategic vulnerability 
in  the  country’s  information  infrastructure  that  could 
cause mortal damage. Six years later, some motion in 
the  direction  of  a  government  strategic  investment  is 
beginning to get under way. This essay will address the 
key  capabilities  needed  at  a  national  scale  and  how 
those capabilities might drive a vigorous research and 
technology  agenda.  The  text  also  addresses  several 
imperative  questions:  How  might  we  organize  a 
government  activity  in  which  many  agencies  surely 
need  to  be  involved  yet  must  march  in  a  coherent 
direction?  What  lessons  can  we  learn  from  the  post-
Sputnik  era  to  regain  leadership  in  the  space  race? 
Has a cyber Sputnik already launched, and, if so, is the 
US already behind in the cyber space race? 
1. Introduction 
Like  many  industrialized  countries,  the  US  is 
vulnerable  to  a  strategically  crippling  cyber  attack 
from  nation-state-class  adversaries.  Most  of  our  real-
world critical assets are controlled via cyber space and 
large  primary  value  such  as  intellectual  property  is 
contained  exclusively  in  cyber  space,  which  makes  it 
as  legitimate  a  part  of  our  territory  as  physical  land, 
thus  the  government  must  “provide  for  the  common 
defense”  of  this  new  territory  as  prescribed  in  the 
preamble of the US Constitution [1]. A strategic multi-
billion-dollar  investment  run  by  the  country’s  best 
experts  can  mitigate  our  risk  of  a  cyber  attack  if  we 
start now [2]. 
This  essay  addresses  the  question  of  why  such  a 
program  is  needed,  what  shape  it  might  take,  what 
sorts of things would need to be done, how we might 
organize  to  accomplish  the  Herculean tasks, and how 
we might get started today on such a path. 
2. National Strategic Threat 
Indications  are 
The Threat: What is the problem, and what is the 
solution?  For  the  problem,  we  must  ask  if  a strategic 
national vulnerability exists, what its scope is, and how 
bad “bad” can get. Without understanding the detailed 
nature  of  the  problem,  the  efficacy  of  any  proposed 
strategy  is  unknown.  We  must  also  ask  how  a 
proposed  national  strategy  would  solve  the  problem, 
and  what  happens  if  it  doesn’t.  These  seem  like 
childishly simple questions, but the answers have been 
elusive. 
that  national  economic 
devastation  is  quite  possible,  and  when  we’re  in  the 
middle  of  a  disaster  isn’t  the  time  to  start  thinking 
about  how  to  respond.  Preparing  for  cyber  war  will

illustrate  the  strategic  damage  a  robust  campaign that 
used multiple attack paths could cause and to create a 
plan  with  sufficient  detail  to  convince  experts  in  the 
domain  of  the  plan’s  validity.  The  plan  took  roughly 
30 days to create. We assumed the adversary had three 
years  of  preparation,  $500  million,  and  30  days  to 
actually execute the attack. The attack campaign’s goal 
was  to  destabilize  the  US  and  depress  the  economy 
with  attacks  on  critical  infrastructure,  thus  reducing 
our ability to project military power, depleting our will 
to  fight,  and  creating  panic  and  distrust  in  the 
government.  
Our 
strategic 
campaign  objectives 
included 
crippling  rail  transportation,  rupturing  oil  and  gas 
pipelines  with  improper  control  (for  example,  with 
cyber  attacks  similar  to  the  one  on  the  Soviet  Trans-
Siberian pipeline that caused a three kiloton explosion, 
as described in “At the Abyss” by Thomas Reed), and 
creating  widespread  power  outages  by  destroying 
hard-to-replace generators and power-line transformers 
with  improper  computer  control  commands.  We  also 
simulated attacks on financial services sectors to create 
mass  confusion  in  transaction  settlement  systems, 
flooded  911  emergency-response 
systems  with 
computer-controlled false alarms to create widespread 
panic,  and  disabled  Internet  service  by  performing 
denial-of-service  attacks  on  the  13  primary  Domain 
Name  Servers  (as  has  been  partially  done  in  actual 
cyber attacks). 
In  our  simulated  campaign,  we  spoofed  attack 
attribution  to  focus  attention  in  the  wrong  direction, 
launched  lethal  first  strikes  (for  example,  hitting  first 
responders  and  backups  before  hitting  primary  cyber 
targets), used a rolling attack barrage to interfere with 
recovery  processes,  delayed  instrument  attacks  until 
they  were  no  longer  needed  in  the  campaign,  bought 
cyber  mercenaries  and  insiders  as  needed  to  gain 
capabilities and access, launched non-cyber (physical) 
attacks  on  “tough”  targets  as  needed,  employed 
psychological  operations 
in 
infrastructure  and  manipulate  public  opinion,  and 
hampered the military by disrupting civilian re-supply 
chains.  
to  create  distrust 
We  vetted  our  simulated  attacks  with  experts  in 
each  of  the  key  critical  infrastructure  domains  and 
verified  the  essence  of  the  plan  and  its  likely  effects. 
There was some uncertainty about the consequences of 
some  attacks—even  now—but  this  was  due  to  a  lack 
of  knowledge  among  the  entire  community  to  fully 
assess such consequences. It would be hubris to think 
and 
than 
our  adversaries  don’t  already  have  a  plan  in  place 
that’s substantially better than our brief sketch or that 
their  capabilities  to  execute  such  an  attack  aren’t 
improving.  
Follow-on.  A  proper  national  strategic 
threat 
assessment  would  parallel  that  of  Dark  Angel  and 
involve top industry experts and business leaders, and 
military  campaign  planners,  economists,  policy 
makers, and others as needed. Sharing across industry 
should  be  encouraged  and 
rewarded.  From  a 
management  perspective,  the  assessment  should  carry 
presidential authority and priority. Essentially, the task 
should involve three separate teams: one for planning 
and  completing  a  concrete  plan,  one  to  execute  the 
plan to the extent needed for demonstration purposes, 
and one to review the results for validity.

The  assessment  must  start  from  the  premise  built 
into  Dark  Angel:  that  cyber  warfare  is  equivalent  to

vulnerability sources must reflect that the organization 
and  design  of  our  production  systems  is  often  more

determining the destruction’s nature and extent. What 
to defend and what kinds of damages to prevent aren’t 
self-evident without such an assessment.

technology 
For illustrative purposes, we estimated the resources 
needed  to  analyze  six  critical  infrastructure  domains 
would take roughly $70 million, 300 top-talent experts, 
and  9  calendar  months.  The  final  report  would  be  a 
definitive  estimate  of  our  true  national  strategic 
vulnerability  to  cyber  attacks,  a  compelling  case  for 
action, and the basis of a prioritized program plan. 
Although we originally created the scenario to help 
policy-makers  understand  the  gravity  of  the  strategic 
threat, further thought suggests that such scenarios can 
provide 
invaluable  driving  metrics  for  assessing 
mitigation programs of the type discussed in this paper. 
An  excellent  and  eerily  parallel  analysis  for  the 
biological threat in terms of such a scenario appears in 
a paper by Richard Danzig [3]. 
3. A New Manhattan Project 
As part of a dialogue with the government in 2002, 
the  PCD  elaborated  on  the  proper  solution  to  the 
strategic vulnerability sketched out by our Dark Angel 
analysis.  Cyber  war  defense  requires  orders  of 
magnitude  more  government 
and 
resources  to  avoid  overwhelming  national  damage 
from strategic attacks. The PCD recommended that the

government (1) step up to a strong defense role against 
serious  attacks,  (2)  focus  on  countering  strategic 
attacks that have real-world effects, (3) develop a top-
down  architecture  and  engineered  approach  to  the 
defined  problem, 
that  current 
technology is insufficient to defend against cyber war, 
and (5) divide the cost burden between the owner (to 
protect  critical  private  cyber  assets)  and 
the 
government  (to  protect  the  integrity  of  the  national 
commons).  
(4)  acknowledge 
As  mentioned  earlier,  the  PCD  chose  the  name 
“Cyber  Manhattan  Project”  to  reflect  the  gravity, 
urgency, priority, focus, top-talent, and funding levels 
needed.  We  acknowledge  that  aspects  of  the  analogy 
are  inapt,  such  as  the  fact  that  (1)  there  is  no  single, 
easily measurable artifact (such as a bomb), (2) a broad 
spectrum of talent and organizations must be involved, 
(3)  much  of  the  work  must  be  conducted  without 
classification  constraint,  and  (4)  once  an 
initial 
capability is achieved, a continued investment will be 
needed  to  maintain  our cyber defense’s effectiveness. 
We sketch the program below. 
Vision.  We  must  rapidly  overcome  our  nation’s 
vulnerability  to  coordinated  strategic  cyber  attacks 
from serious enemies. 
indicating 
Urgency.  Major  potential  adversaries  are  actively 
pursuing  cyber  war  capabilities, 
the 
increasing  probability  of  future  cyber  campaigns. 
Moreover,  current  cyber  defenses  and  best  practices 
are  ineffective,  active  measures  to  shut  down  our 
adversaries’ abilities to attack through physical access 
will drive them to cyber space, and we face potentially 
greater  vulnerability  and  lethality  from  combined 
cyber  and  physical  attacks.  Finally,  developing  a 
defense to this threat is a multiyear effort, so we can’t 
wait until we’re in the midst of our first major strategic 
attack campaign to start defending against it. 
Priority.  A  major  initiative  on  the  order  of  the 
Cyber  Manhattan  Project  is  the  right  path  to  address 
our current situation. The offensive threat is growing, 
so defense must be fielded at a faster rate. A top-down 
approach  with  a  driving  architect  can  address  the 
problem  and  achieve  the  requisite  objectives,  but 
bottom-up  efforts,  even  if  coordinated,  leave  gaps 
because  there’s  no  ownership  of  key  parts  of  the 
problem.  Cyber  defense  mechanisms  must  integrate 
into  a  coordinated  system,  and  cyber  defense 
operations  must comprise a fully integrated defensive 
force.  For  success,  the  creation  of  national  cyber 
defense  capabilities  must  be  a  national  funding 
priority.  Can  you  imagine  the  original  Manhattan 
Project succeeding without such a focus?

of  National 
Feasibility.  Not  only  is  the  creation  of  national 
cyber  defense  capabilities  critically  urgent  and 
important,  it’s  also  feasible.  (1)  Technically,  many 
effective  defensive  technologies  exist  but  are  in 
research stages and must be transitioned to operational 
use, some already have limited field testing, and others 
already exist to address broad classes of novel attacks. 
Moreover,  the  required  computational  resources  for 
intensive  activities  such  as  correlation  of  attack  and 
modeling/simulating  attack  strategies  and  tactics  are 
available  today.  Ongoing  research  sponsored  by  the
