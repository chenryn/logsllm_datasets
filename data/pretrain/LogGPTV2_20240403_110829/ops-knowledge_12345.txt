User: I'm looking at using CouchDB for one project and the GAE app engine datastore in the other.  For relational stuff I tend to use postgres, although I much prefer an ORM.  
Anyway, what use cases suit non relational datastores best?
Assistant: In some cases that are simply nice. ZODB is a Python-only object database, that is so well-integrated with Python that you can simply forget that it's there. You don't have to bother about it, most of the time.
