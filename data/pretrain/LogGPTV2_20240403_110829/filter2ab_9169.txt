**ATT&CK ID:** T0822  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** External Remote Services

Adversaries may exploit external remote services as an initial entry point into a network. These services enable users to access internal network resources from external locations. Common examples include Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), Citrix, and other similar access mechanisms. Remote service gateways typically manage the connections and credential authentication for these services, making them potential targets for malicious actors.
