When viewing the components page of the documentation, the list of sections in
the left navigation is so long that it extends beyond the end of my monitor.
Because it is in a fixed position I can't scroll to see the bottom of the
list. Longer lists of subsections hide more section links because they expand
and push them down. There are two ways I can see what's at the bottom: scroll
through the whole page, or click on one of the sections that has no
subsections and allow the whole list to barely fit.
I'm on a 13" macbook pro w/ retina with default resolution and font / size
settings. I'm using Chrome with the bookmark bar enabled, and I have the
window full screened.
