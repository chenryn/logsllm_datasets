In the current toolchain roadmap page, I find the information regarding Python
versions confusing as the last versions of SciPy are not listed and also there
is no information about the max Python version for a given version of SciPy.
I propose to change the table with the following columns:
SciPy version | Python versions | NumPy versions  
---|---|---  
1.7 | >3.7, =1.16.5, >= 1.20.x  
Right now, I am not sure for most items about the max Python version. This
should also answer: should we drop Python 3.7 for 1.8? Same goes for NumPy
1.16.5.
