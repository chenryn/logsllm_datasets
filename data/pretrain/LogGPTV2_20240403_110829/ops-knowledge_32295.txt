Question: "Consider an x86 system which uses little-endian format for memory storage. If you are given the task of writing a multi-byte value to memory and later reading it back, which of the following considerations should you keep in mind to ensure correct handling of the values?"
 "A": "Always store the most significant byte of the word at the lowest memory address to maintain the correct sequence when reading the value back."
 "B": "Remember that the least significant byte of the word is stored at the lowest memory address, which is crucial when reading or writing values to memory."
 "C": "Ignore the little-endian format when working with memory diagrams, as the diagrams will automatically adjust the byte order."
 "D": "Be aware that using word-sized units on memory diagrams can help abstract away the little-endian byte order, although the actual storage is little-endian."
