User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I reset the local Administrator password for a Windows Vista client connected to a domain? I have a Windows Vista client computer that is connected to a Windows Domain. I can login with the user account for DOMAIN\user1 and also with the Domain Administrator account DOMAIN\Administrator but the local Administrator account is locked. And I need to log in to the local Administrator account to connect the client computer to another domain controller.

How can I reset the local Administrator password for a Windows Vista client connected to a domain?

The server is a Windows SBS 2003.

Assistant: You dont have do disconnect the client from the domain first. Log on with your domain admin-user, and bring up computer management (Right-click "My computer"-->"Manage")

In Computer Management, go to "Local Users and Groups"-->Users. Right-click the administrator and choose "Set Password". Also, make sure the account is enabled if you want to use it (In Vista, by default, the account is disabled).
