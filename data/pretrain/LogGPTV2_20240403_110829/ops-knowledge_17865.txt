User: I have a python daemon running as a part of my web app/ How can I quickly check (using python) if my daemon is running and, if not, launch it?
I want to do it that way to fix any crashes of the daemon, and so the script does not have to be run manually, it will automatically run as soon as it is called and then stay running.
How can i check (using python) if my script is running?
Assistant: I was looking for an answer on this and in my case, came to mind a very easy and very good solution, in my opinion (since it's not possible to exist a false positive on this, I guess - how can the timestamp on the TXT be updated if the program doesn't do it):
--> just keep writing on a TXT the current timestamp in some time interval, depending on your needs (here each half hour was perfect).
If the timestamp on the TXT is outdated relatively to the current one when you check, then there was a problem on the program and it should be restarted or what you prefer to do.
