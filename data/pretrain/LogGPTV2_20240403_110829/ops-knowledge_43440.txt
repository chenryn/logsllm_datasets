User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I prevent apache DoS flood? I've configured a server running apache and a couple of days ago I noticed in the logs that there are bots running endless queries to the site. The logs show that those bots are running about 60 queries per second for about 20 minutes coming from the same IP address. 
How can I limit the queries and what's the appropriate way of dealing with such bots?  

Thanks in advance.

Assistant: Consider installing a rate limiting software, it will help you to defend not only against lawful bots.
You can use mod_evasive for Apache, or you can install Nginx as a frontend and use its HttpLimitZoneModule, it is built in.
