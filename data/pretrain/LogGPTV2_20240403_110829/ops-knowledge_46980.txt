User: I have a script written in tcl, that load a dll file. I want to load this file in python. I am not sure if the dll file is written in tcl, but because the tcl file imports it I think it is written in tcl. I have tried to use WinDLL("path_to_dll") but I get that there is no module with the provided name.
Assistant: The easiest way would be by using the Tkinter package and its built in Tcl interpreter inside your Python Process.
If it is a Tcl extension dll, it makes no real sense to call it from Python without much setup first.
