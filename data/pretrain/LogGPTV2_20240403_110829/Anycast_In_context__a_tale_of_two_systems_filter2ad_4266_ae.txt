### 1. Introduction and Analysis of Deployment Size and Performance

**(a)**
**Figure 7: Impact of Deployment Size on Latency and Inflation**

- **Latency and Deployment Size (Fig. 7a-left):** Larger deployments lead to lower latency because they provide more low-latency options to users (Fig. 7b). However, fewer users visit their closest site (Fig. 7a-right), leading to increased geographic inflation.
- **Inflation and Median Latency (Fig. 7b):** As the number of sites increases, inflation also increases (indicating less efficiency), but median latency decreases. This effect is also observed in Figure 2, where larger root deployments tend to have more inflation but lower latency.

Intuitively, larger deployments are less efficient because BGP may make "wrong" decisions about which routes to export more often. Conversely, they offer lower latency due to the availability of more low-latency options for users. These results suggest that efficiency may not be a useful metric for assessing performance.

**(b)**
**Efficiency and Latency Metrics**

- **Efficiency Definition:** We define efficiency as the percentage of users with zero geographic inflation (i.e., y-axis intercepts in Figures 2a and 5a). This is a rough measure of how optimal routing is, although zero geographic inflation does not guarantee optimal routing if users take a circuitous route to their closest site.
- **Latency Calculation:** The latency to root letters in Figure 7a is the median latency across all RIPE Atlas probes over an hour in 2018 (median per probe, then a median across probes). Latencies to rings are medians from Figure 4a.

The trend that efficiency decreases with deployment size is less clear in the root DNS than in Microsoft’s CDN, likely due to different deployment strategies by various organizations running the root letters. A notable exception is F root, which had the lowest median latency (15 ms) in 2018 and good efficiency (39%). This is because F root partners with Cloudflare, a global CDN, and benefits from a deployment optimized for low user latency.

Interestingly, R95 and F root have similar numbers of sites and low median latency (approximately 15 ms), but F root has considerably lower efficiency. This suggests that low efficiency is not necessarily bad. Conversely, high efficiency does not always result in low latency; for example, 49% of users reach their closest B root site, but the median latency to B root is 160 ms.

Prior work using similar metrics for root letters with data from RIPE Atlas arrived at different conclusions [51], possibly due to the limited coverage of RIPE Atlas.

### 2. Site Coverage and User Proximity

**Figure 7b: Site Coverage and User Proximity**

- **Coverage Definition:** "Coverage" means the closest site is within \(X\) km of users (x-axis). High coverage implies there is a reasonably low latency option for users.
- **Root DNS Coverage:** The root DNS as a whole (All Roots) has impressive coverage, with 91% of Microsoft users within 500 km of a root site. Individual root letters can even have better coverage than rings (e.g., L root has 94% of users within 1,000 km, whereas R110 has 90%).

This figure also demonstrates that approximating root DNS users with Microsoft users (as in Fig. 2) is fair, since root letters have decent coverage of Microsoft users. An exception is D root, which did not have global sites in India at the time, where Microsoft has both anycast sites and a large user population.

### 3. Differing Incentives and Outcomes

**7.3 Differing Incentives Lead to Different Investments and Outcomes**

We now discuss how incentives have shaped deployments and how our findings may extend to other anycast deployments.

**7.3.1 Drivers for Growth**

- **Growth of Root DNS Sites:** Over the past five years, the number of root DNS sites has more than doubled from 516 to 1367. Table 1 summarizes the main reasons for this expansion, primarily driven by the need to reduce latency and improve DDoS resilience.
- **Reasons for Expansion:** Root operators indicated that growth was driven by the need to improve resilience in two dimensions: DDoS and ISP resilience. DDoS resilience involves increasing overall capacity to withstand attacks, while ISP resilience ensures service continuity even if connectivity to the rest of the Internet is severed.
- **Future Plans:** According to operator responses, the increase in root DNS sites will likely slow in the coming years.

**Comparison with Microsoft's CDN**

- **Centralized vs. Decentralized Deployment:** Unlike the decentralized deployment of root DNS, Microsoft’s CDN is centrally managed and latency-sensitive. Operators optimize and monitor latency, minimizing inflation with direct paths to many users.
- **Commercial Motivations:** Microsoft's CDN expansion is driven by business needs to support new markets, contrasting with the root DNS's focus on resilience and latency reduction.

### 4. Generalization and Other Anycast Systems

**7.3.2 Other Anycast Systems**

- **Key Takeaway:** Our results cannot be generalized to other systems using anycast. Anycast must be assessed in the context of the specific system it resides in. Prior work that assumed general applicability of anycast results from one system (root DNS) led to misleading conclusions [51].
- **Other Anycast Services:** Other systems using anycast include Akamai DNS authoritative resolvers, Google Cloud VMs, and Google Public DNS. Each of these services has different performance requirements, and the degree to which performance improvements are due to deployment or route configuration tuning is unknown [9].

### 5. Related Work

**8. Related Work**

- **Root DNS Anycast:** Many prior studies have examined latency and inflation in the root DNS [13, 51, 52, 67, 69]. Our work builds on these studies by analyzing nearly every root letter and calculating inflation for millions of recursive resolvers in 35,000 ASes. We also calculate latency inflation differently, offering a new perspective and allowing direct comparisons between Microsoft’s CDN and root DNS.
- **CDN Anycast:** Some CDNs use IP anycast [16, 21, 30, 65, 75]. Prior work on CDNs found similarly low inflation [16]. Our study presents a much larger dataset, updating numerical results and placing performance metrics in the context of user experience.
- **Recursive Resolvers and Web Performance:** Prior work has examined local resolvers' statistics and latency implications [18, 44]. We present additional pathological behaviors of popular recursives and their impact on root DNS load times. Recent work considers DNS in the context of web performance but does not specifically look at root DNS latency [6].

### 6. Conclusion

**9. Conclusion**

- **Anycast Performance:** While anycast performance is interesting, prior studies have drawn conclusions primarily from root DNS anycast [51]. Our results show that anycast operates differently in CDNs, with less inflation. Differences stem from the impact of anycast service latency and inflation on user-perceived latency.
- **Importance of Context:** Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple subjects in measurement studies and explain why anycast continues to see wide, growing deployment.
