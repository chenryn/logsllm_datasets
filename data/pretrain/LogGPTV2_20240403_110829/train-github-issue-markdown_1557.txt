Based on my knowledge regarding BTrees (I know how they are built, how they
work and I also know what a B+ tree is), which I know is by far not the best,
I think you might really want to use a B+
Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree) if you do not already.  
That would make the predecessor and successor methods currently discussed here
quite fast with considerable memory-overhead, also it would make implementing
iterators (and cursors) and therefore the range API a lot easier and probably
faster.
If I am missing something, please tell me.
