#### Protection Against Buffer Overflows
Third, while the current recompilation-based implementation allows users of open-source software or software companies to recompile their programs with HeapTherapy to protect heap memory security, binary programs cannot be conveniently protected. However, recompilation is not an inherent limitation of the technique discussed in this paper. A binary-instrumentation-based implementation is possible. We are currently developing tools to integrate PCC encoding into programs through binary instrumentation, and the shared library of HeapTherapy can be loaded using LD_PRELOAD.

#### Speed Overhead Due to HeapTherapy
Figure 13 illustrates the speed overhead caused by HeapTherapy. Each bar represents a different experimental setting. For example, "5 patches, 5-page padding" indicates that 5 simulated patches are applied based on the 5-VCCID set, and each vulnerable buffer is padded with 5 pages. The guard page is enabled for all vulnerable buffers. The last bar in each group is based on the related work, DieHarder.

#### Other Potential Applications
While this paper primarily focuses on the heap buffer overflow problem, HeapTherapy can generate patches to address various other memory errors, such as double frees, dangling pointers, and uninitialized heap buffer reads. We can extend the specification of temporary patches to support more bug types and add bug-specific predefined handling to the memory allocation wrapper. Some examples are discussed below.

**Dangling Pointer Bugs:**
One type of dangling pointer bug arises from premature deallocation of some buffers. If a temporary patch is generated to fix a dangling pointer bug, we can implement a simple handling mechanism that is invoked when a free call is hooked. This handling checks if the buffer's CCID matches the VCCID in the patch; if so, the buffer's deallocation is delayed. This ensures that the pointer variable previously containing a dangling pointer can be dereferenced safely.

**Uninitialized Heap Buffer Read Bugs:**
To address uninitialized heap buffer read bugs, we write a simple handling that zero-fills newly allocated buffers. The `malloc` function calls this handling only when the buffer's CCID matches the VCCID of a patch that treats an uninitialized read bug. This approach ensures that the effort of zero-filling is limited to buffers where an uninitialized read may occur.

The memory management wrappers search in the hash table assembled with patches to determine the necessary actions and enforce them on the buffers. Therefore, HeapTherapy is extensible, and new handling functions and patches can be defined to deal with new types of heap bugs.

#### Conclusions
We propose HeapTherapy, an end-to-end solution that performs diagnosis and generates defenses against zero-day heap buffer overflow attacks in real-time. HeapTherapy creatively employs calling context encoding to describe and identify vulnerable buffers precisely and efficiently. It does not produce false positives and remains effective under polymorphic attacks. Our evaluation shows that it incurs a low speed and memory overhead even when dealing with multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously. It does not require infrastructure for request recording and replaying, making it suitable for protecting both personal applications and enterprise services. The technique can be extended to address other heap bugs, such as premature deallocation and uninitialized reads.
