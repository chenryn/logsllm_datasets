## Abstract
Despite significant efforts to increase bandwidth and network penetration, web access remains prohibitively slow in many developing regions. This paper explores the fundamental bottlenecks that cause poor web performance from a client's perspective by carefully dissecting webpage load latency contributors in Ghana. Based on measurements from 2012 to 2014, we identify several issues arising from the increasing complexity of web pages and the number of server redirections required to render page assets. We find that, rather than bandwidth, the primary bottleneck is the lack of good DNS servers and caching infrastructure. The main bottlenecks are: (a) Recursive DNS query resolutions; (b) HTTP redirections; (c) TLS/SSL handshakes. We experiment with well-known end-to-end latency optimizations and find that simple DNS caching, redirection caching, and the use of SPDY can substantially improve user-perceived latency.

## 1. Introduction
Web access in developing regions suffers from a continually widening content-connectivity gap: the rate of growth in connectivity is outstripped by the growth in the complexity of web pages. Despite lagging broadband and latency statistics relative to OECD countries, Internet infrastructure in developing regions has been improving steadily over the past decade [1]. For example, Accra, the capital of Ghana, has several major undersea cable landing sites, including ACE, Main One, Glo1, and WACS [5]. However, the web has seen a 30 to 50-fold increase in average page complexity over the same period [4, 11, 15, 19], significantly outpacing the growth in connectivity.

Recent works have explored various facets of slow internet in developing regions from different perspectives, geographic locations, and infrastructural contexts. Some studies find that high latency, buffer bloat, and packet loss are central causes of poor performance [25]. Others examine problems caused by the interaction between low-bandwidth links and high network contention by TCP flows [16]. Still, other research cites routing protocols and architectural issues, such as Content Distribution Network (CDN) server placement, as key problems [4].

In this paper, we aim to understand the causes of user-perceived web latency in Ghana, one of the most well-connected developing countries [5]. Unlike prior work in developing regions [16, 18, 25] that focuses on access link performance, our measurements detail the core infrastructural issues leading to a poor web browsing experience. Several studies have examined similar web performance issues in fixed/wired or mobile environments [14, 31], but our unique context results in a different set of issues.

Our measurement-driven approach involved collecting download traces of Alexa's [2] top webpages from different locations in Ghana from 2012 to 2014. We also collected similar measurements in three well-connected locations around the world for comparison. Our key findings include:
- Bandwidth is less of a bottleneck than other factors.
- The actual time spent downloading content represents only a small fraction of the end-to-end page download time.
- The main culprit of user-perceived web latency is DNS resolution.
- Caching DNS records can decrease page load times in Ghana by up to five times.
- Other important factors for high end-to-end latency include HTTP redirections and TLS/SSL handshakes for secure pages.
- Caching HTTP redirects can enhance page load time by 20%.
- Long TLS/SSL handshakes are present in 15% of Alexa page requests.
- Experimenting with SPDY, we found that it can reduce some page load times in Ghana by up to 30%, depending on server locations.

## 2. Motivation
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been linked to development [26]. In the last four years, developing nations have experienced a significant increase in the number of internet users, a promising trend. Between 2009 and 2011, Ghana saw a substantial increase in internet users from 5.4% to 14.1% [12], the largest in the country's history. Similar trends are reflected in other developing countries, resulting in millions of new internet users each year. However, the internet these users encounter is often extremely slow and cannot fully utilize available web content.

Very little effort has been expended on understanding and solving internet problems in developing regions, relative to the number of people affected. Even basic questions, like why the internet is so slow, are challenging to answer due to difficulties in data collection and the multitude of possible answers depending on the context. When these problems are investigated, findings range widely from the obvious, such as low bandwidth and high latency, to the esoteric, such as mis-routing due to a lack of peering points and small-packet regimes [20, 13, 25, 16]. Solutions to these problems are similarly varied [24, 23, 17]. Motivated by these differing ideas, this paper seeks to answer why page loading times are so slow in Ghana.

## 3. Methodology
We used standard off-the-shelf tools to collect our traces. We collected HTTP Archive (HAR) browser-level traces using Firefox Version 13 with the Firebug extension and Selenium [7] to automate the process. The browser cache was cleared after each webpage. We also used the Linux `dig` command-line tool to examine DNS requests in more detail.

**Table 1: Experiment Details**

| Time         | Type        | Websites          | Connectivity | Location                                   |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| August 2012  | DNS (dig+trace) | Alexa’s top 500 global | Wi-Fi & 3G   | Accra and Hohoe (3G)                      |
| March-July 2013 | DNS (dig+trace) | Alexa’s top 500 global | Wi-Fi & 3G   | Accra, Abu Dhabi, NY, and Bremen          |
| April 2014   | SPDY        | Alexa’s top 1000 global | Both         | Accra, Abu Dhabi, NY, and Bremen          |
| August 2014  | DNS (dig+trace) | Alexa’s top 500 local | Wi-Fi & 3G   | Accra, Abu Dhabi, NY, and Bremen          |
| August 2014  | Link        | Alexa’s top 500 local | Wi-Fi        | Accra, Abu Dhabi, NY, Bremen, and Kumawu (3G) |

We conducted experiments from six locations: New York City, Bremen (Germany), Abu Dhabi (UAE), Accra (Ghana), Kumawu, and Hohoe (both small cities in Ghana). In New York, Bremen, Abu Dhabi, and Accra, we used state-of-the-art machines with a standard Linux distribution (Ubuntu and CentOS) on university campus networks with over 10 Mbps connections using Wi-Fi and 3G HSPA cellular network connections. In Hohoe/Kumawu, our traces were collected from a 3G HSPA connection. In Hohoe, the fastest wired network was limited to ADSL at a single internet café, and we were unable to collect data from that location.

For our experiments, we collected web traces of Alexa's [2] top 1000 global and top 500 local websites, evaluated DNS performance using the `dig +trace` command, and assessed SPDY performance in Ghana, as detailed in Table 1.

## 4. Dissecting Page Loads
In this section, we focus on identifying problems associated with the webpage download process in Ghana by examining the set of browser-level traces we collected in 2012. Some of the timing information we collected from the HAR files includes:
- **Blocking:** Waiting time of a request in the queue due to the maximum number of parallel TCP connections a browser can open per server.
- **DNS Lookup:** Time required to resolve a host name.
- **Connecting:** TCP connection setup time.
- **Sending:** Time required to send an HTTP request to the server.
- **Waiting:** Time required to receive a response from the server.
- **Receiving:** Time required to read the entire response from the server.
