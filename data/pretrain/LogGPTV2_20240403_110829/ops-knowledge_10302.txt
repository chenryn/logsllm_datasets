User: How to use Prometheus and Grafana for container monitoring and visualization? Please list the configuration file content of Prometheus and the dashboard display of Grafana.
Assistant: 1. Prometheus configuration file content: ``` global: scrape_interval: 15s evaluation_interval: 15s scrape_configs: - job_name: 'prometheus' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9090'] - job_name: 'node_exporter' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] - job_name: 'container_exporter' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9104'] ``` Among them: - `scrape_interval` and `evaluation_interval` represent the time interval and evaluation index of Prometheus crawling data respectively - `scrape_configs` defines the information of the monitored object; - `job_name` indicates the name of the current monitoring object; - `targets` indicates the IP address and port number of the current monitoring object. 2. Grafana's dashboard display: You can create a dashboard through Grafana to display Prometheus monitoring data. For example, here is a dashboard showing the CPU and memory usage of Docker containers: - Usage line graph: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jxzls/app-images/master/grafana-1.png ) - CPU usage per container: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jxzls/app-images/master/grafana-2.png) - Memory usage per container: ![](https ://raw.githubusercontent.com/jxzls/app-images/master/grafana-3.png)
