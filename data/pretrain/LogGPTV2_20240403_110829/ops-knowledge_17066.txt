User: Introduce the basic concepts and implementation principles of Docker containers, as well as application scenarios, advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Basic concepts of Docker containers: 1. Image: The basis of Docker containers, which provide packaging of operating systems, operating environments, and applications at runtime. 2. Container: It can be regarded as a running image, which is a running instance of Docker. 3. Warehouse: store images of different versions, similar to software libraries or libraries. Docker container implementation principle: Docker implements container isolation through the Linux kernel technology cgroup and namespace. Cgroup can limit the memory, CPU and other resource usage of a process group; namespace can realize independent network, file system, process, etc. in the container. Docker container application scenarios: 1. Application deployment: containerized applications can be easily deployed on any host, and the correctness of software dependencies is ensured. 2. Containerized test environment: A containerized test environment can improve test efficiency. 3. Continuous integration: Docker's port performance and flexibility are especially suitable for continuous delivery and integration. Advantages and disadvantages of Docker containers: Advantages: 1. Easy to deploy: Container deployment is not restricted by the environment, and the performance of applications in each environment is basically the same. 2. Easy operation and maintenance: Docker realizes the "packaging" of applications through mirroring + containers, and they can be run wherever they are needed. 3. Saving resources: Containers save more resources than virtual machines. Disadvantages: 1. Learning cost: You need to master the Docker technology stack and Linux foundation. 2. System complexity: The network, storage, and security aspects of containerized applications require certain technical support. 3. Security issues: Container security issues may cause some containers to scan each other, attack each other due to container isolation issues, and you need to pay attention to security configurations.
