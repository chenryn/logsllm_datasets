I had this issue, but a friend of mine started FreeCodeCamp and had a similar
issue. It wasn't browser specific to Chrome or Firefox (occurring in both),
but what seems to happen is if you select something say 3/4 down the page (for
reference my monitor is 1366x768, also happened in my 1920x1080 monitor) your
cursor will be close to, but not where you selected. It's a minor issue but
sufficiently annoying when you try to select something specific in a challenge
and your cursor is jumping around, or you're typing not where you think you
were, and then messing up your code.
The coding window in the later challenges (I'm currently on Seek and Destroy)
don't seem to have these same issues and I noticed it did go away. Since a
friend of mine had the same issue I figured I should submit it.
Challenge Create a Text Field has an issue.
