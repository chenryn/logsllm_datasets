### Environment
  * Dubbo version: master
  * Operating System version: windows
  * Java version: 1.8
In ExtensionLoader, EXTENSION INSTANCES is a ConcurrentHashMap with a default
size, and the extension class provided in Dubbo has exceeded 16.  
Start the program, it will expand at least twice. I think it is more
appropriate to add an initial size of 64 here.  
Other places where ConcurrentHashMap is used should also pay attention to a
suitable initial size
