3.2 Burst Analysis of Screen-off Trafﬁc
Following the methodology in §2.2, Table 3 lists the results of
the burst analysis for screen-off trafﬁc, with that of screen-on trafﬁc
listed for comparison purposes.
We observe that screen-off trafﬁc contains much more bursts
than screen-on trafﬁc, although the total number of packets for
screen-off trafﬁc is smaller. For screen-off trafﬁc, bursts are smaller
in terms of the number of downlink/uplink packets and payload.
Especially, for average downlink payload per burst, screen-on traf-
ﬁc is 7 times that for screen-off trafﬁc. In addition, the average
burst length and the IBT following bursts for screen-off trafﬁc are
both shorter than those of screen-on trafﬁc. The above observations
indicate that screen-off bursts are smaller in size and duration and
appear more often — such behavior is likely to cause longer chan-
nel occupation time in the high energy RRC state and therefore
incur signiﬁcant battery usage.
By studying the screen-off burst behavior of individual processes,
we classify them into two separate groups. The ﬁrst group, which
we call Gathered group, includes Genie Widget, Google Music,
/system/bin/mediaserver and android.process.media.
These processes have a small number of larger bursts in terms of
the number of uplink/downlink packets per burst and the average
downlink payload. Notice that the uplink payload for these bursts
is not necessarily large, since a small uplink payload of HTTP re-
quest can result in a large ﬁle download. The Gathered group also
has longer bursts and longer trailing IBT in average, indicating a
less frequent appearance.

a Each “avg” in this table stands for the average value per burst.
Table 3: Burst analysis of screen-on/off trafﬁc and top processes for screen-off trafﬁc.
The rest of the processes fall into the second group, called the
Scattered group, which generate signiﬁcantly more bursts and on
average, these bursts contain less packets and smaller downlink
payload. In addition, these bursts are shorter in duration and appear
more frequently. A representative process from this group is Face-
book, which includes over 200,000 bursts, and the major reason for
this behavior of Facebook is the periodic keep-alive transfers [14].
Based on this comparison, we believe that it is both easy and im-
portant for mobile application developers to optimize their applica-
tion behaviors during the screen-off stage, e.g., for delay-insensitive
trafﬁc, they can batch the data into larger bursts, or even eliminate
the screen-off data transfers if they are not necessary.
4. RADIO RESOURCE, ENERGY IMPACT
AND OPTIMIZATION
Using the network and power model simulation (§2.3), we now
evaluate the radio resource and energy impact of screen-off trafﬁc
and evaluate some optimization approaches.
4.1 Radio Resource and Energy Impact of
Screen-off Trafﬁc
Table 4 presents highlights of the simulation results using the
LTE network and power model deﬁned in our previous work [9].
∆E, ∆S and ∆D represents the change of network energy, sig-
naling overhead and channel scheduling delay after removing the
trafﬁc of an application or type, and a negative value indicates a
reduction. The results indicate that, compared to screen-on trafﬁc,
screen-off trafﬁc clearly has larger impact on the network energy
E, as well as S and D. For example, removing all screen-off trafﬁc
reduces the total network energy by 58.55%, and for one user, this
reduction is as high as 73.53%.
Comparing the Gathered group and Scattered group discussed
in §3.2, the former has very small impact on E, S and D, while
the later has a substantial impact. This is because, for the Scattered
group, a large number of small bursts could result in a large number
of RRC tails if the IBTs among these bursts are larger than the tail
time and a long channel occupation time otherwise. For example,
