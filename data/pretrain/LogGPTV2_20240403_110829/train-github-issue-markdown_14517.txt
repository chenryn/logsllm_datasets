When using the `=>` (arrow function) syntax within a script inside an HTML file, you may encounter an error message instructing you to set `target: "ES6"` in your `jsconfig.json` file. However, even after making this change, the error persists because the `jsconfig.json` settings only apply to `.js` files and not to inline scripts within HTML files.

To resolve this issue, consider one of the following approaches:

1. **Move the Script to an External File**: Place the script in a separate `.js` file and include it in your HTML using a `<script>` tag. This way, the `jsconfig.json` settings will be applied correctly.
2. **Use a Babel Transpiler**: If you need to keep the script inline, you can use a tool like Babel to transpile your code to a compatible version before including it in the HTML.
3. **Update Browser Compatibility**: Ensure that the browser you are using supports ES6 syntax. If not, you may need to use a polyfill or transpile the code to a more widely supported version of JavaScript.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your arrow functions and other ES6 features work correctly in your HTML files.
