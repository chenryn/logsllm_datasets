User:  Please analyze the following SQL query performance issues and provide optimization suggestions. SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = '12345' AND order_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' ORDER BY order_date DESC LIMIT 10;
Assistant: The query has the following performance problems: 1. No index is used: the customer_id and order_date fields in the query condition should be indexed to quickly locate the qualified rows. 2. Sorting is required: Due to the use of the ORDER BY clause, the database needs to sort the results, which will increase resource consumption and query time. 3. Not using appropriate data types: Comparing field values of date type with strings is clumsy and inefficient. The following are optimization suggestions for the above performance issues: 1. Build indexes: Build indexes on the customer_id and order_date fields. If you want to optimize the query conditions, you can consider combining the two fields into a composite index. 2. Use a more appropriate sorting method: If you only need to fetch 10 rows of data, you can use the TOP/LIMIT clause instead of ORDER BY. 3. Use appropriate data types: Store datetime values in datetime columns for easier comparison and sorting. If the table structure cannot be changed, convert the string value to a datetime type value. In summary, optimization can be achieved by building indexes, changing sorting methods, and modifying data types.
