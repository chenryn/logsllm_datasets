Assistant: To configure the SMTP service and send emails, you can follow the steps below: 1. Select the SMTP email service provider, such as Gmail or Outlook. When choosing a service provider, make sure you know information such as the SMTP hostname, port, username, and password. 2. Configure the SMTP client, such as Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird. Start by opening your mail client and find an option such as "Account Settings" or "Mail Setup" in the menu. In SMTP Settings, enter information such as the SMTP hostname, port, and username. You may need to select the SSL or TLS secure connection option, depending on the requirements of your SMTP service provider. 3. Configure the email content. Compose your message in your mail client, making sure to enter the correct email address in the "To" field. Fill in the relevant information in the subject and body. 4. Send the email. Before sending the email, please make sure that all the information to be sent has been filled out. Click the "Send" button to send the mail to the SMTP server. The SMTP server will then forward the mail to the recipient according to your settings. Please note that SMTP service providers may have some restrictions, such as the number of mails sent per day or per hour, message size, etc. Therefore, take some time to understand the requirements and limitations of your SMTP service provider before configuring your SMTP service.
