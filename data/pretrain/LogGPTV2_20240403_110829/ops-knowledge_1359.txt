Question: In a recent security audit, it was found that the lock screens of the company's Windows clients displayed too much personal information about the users. As a security consultant, which recommendations would you make to enhance security without significantly impacting user experience?
"A": "Recommend removing all personal identifiers from the lock screen, including names and photos, to prevent any chance of social engineering.",
"B": "Suggest configuring the lock screen to display the user's full name and photo for easier identification by colleagues.",
"C": "Advise displaying a generic message such as 'This workstation is locked' instead of any user-specific information.",
"D": "Propose to display the user's department and job title to allow for quick identification while reducing the risk of personal information misuse."
