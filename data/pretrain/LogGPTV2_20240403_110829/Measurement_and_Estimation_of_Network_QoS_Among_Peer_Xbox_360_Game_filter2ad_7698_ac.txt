# of probes
Fig. 12. Capacity variation for preﬁx pairs
Fig. 13. Number of repetitive probes
Based on these results, we believe the Preﬁx History Predictor can adequately predict
the RTT between a pair of consoles based on an NPQ estimate from a prior probe
between consoles in the same pair of preﬁxes. However, this prediction is not as accurate
as the IP History Predictor - so we suggest ﬁrst applying that predictor, and only if it
cannot make a prediction, then using the Preﬁx History Predictor. To show in how
many cases this would apply, we present Figure 13. We plot the CDF of the number of
repeated probes in the entire trace between the same pair of IP addresses, and the same
pair of preﬁxes. Only about 5% of pairs of consoles probed each other more than once,
while about 39% of preﬁx pairs probed each other more than once. Note that we have
clipped the horizontal axis at 30 for presentation purposes - the IP pair line continues to
114 probes, and the preﬁx pair line continues to 14,513.
5.3 Geography Predictor
While 39% of preﬁx pairs is still a signiﬁcant fraction of the number of consoles, and
has the potential to reduce a far larger portion of probes those preﬁxes probed each other
several times, there is still about 61% of preﬁx pairs left. We now consider the Geogra-
phy Predictor - we hypothesize that the geographic distance between two consoles has
a strong correlation with their RTT, and that current databases for mapping IP addresses
to geographic coordinates are reasonably accurate for this. This may be true if distant
IP addresses traverse longer links and more router hops to communicate. This predictor
does not consider past history, and thus could be applied to any pair of consoles.

Fig. 14. Probe distance distribution
Fig. 15. Distance-RTT correlation
It is not clear why geographic distance would be correlated with down/up stream
bottleneck capacity - our analysis indicates the correlations are -0.075 and -0.097, re-
spectively. Thus we omit detailed results on capacity for conciseness and focus on RTT.
We use a MaxMind location database to convert the source and destination IP ad-
dresses in a probe to the geographic coordinates, and apply the great circle distance
algorithm [9] to calculate distance. The distribution in Figure 14 shows a wide range of
distances between probe hosts. About 14% of probes traversed over 5,000 miles, which
indicates there is room for optimization by ﬁltering out these console pairs from the
probe list. The graph also shows that we have enough samples to examine the correla-
tion between distance and delay.
Figure 15 plots the correlation between distance and RTT for 100,000 randomly
selected probes (we were unable to plot over 126 million points on the same graph –
different samples of 100,000 points gave us very similar graphs). We see a very strong
correlation between the geographic distance and minimum RTT. However, there is a lot
of noise above that minimum, which may be due to queuing delays and sub-optimal
routes. We conclude that the Geography Predictor is useful for ﬁltering out pairs of IP
addresses that are too far apart to have a low RTT.
5.4 Using Predictors in Matchmaking
Incorporating these three predictors into matchmaking is not difﬁcult. For the IP History
Predictor, each console will keep a history of previous probes that it was involved in.
It can look up this history before attempting any future probes, and decide which can-
didate game hosts to ignore. For the Preﬁx History Predictor, the Xbox Live server can
ﬁlter the set of candidate game hosts it provides to each console based on their preﬁxes
and past probe history. The server already has the past NPQ estimates, and it can easily
keep fresh BGP tables to look up preﬁxes. The Geography Predictor requires an IP to
geographic coordinate database, on either the Xbox Live server or on each console.
6 Prior Work
Most prior work on network gaming has focused on games with a client-server archi-
tecture [4,5,10] where the server is well-provisioned and dedicated. The literature on
P2P games is very limited. In [6], the authors examine game clients deployed in three
Measurement and Estimation of Network QoS Among Peer Xbox 360 Game Players

access networks: dial-up, cable and ADSL. However, their experiments are limited to
one client per access network, and use only one cable and one ADSL link. The game
trafﬁc of Halo 2 is analyzed in [11] in a LAN environment for trafﬁc modeling and not
for end-to-end network characteristics between real Halo 2 players.
There has been much prior work on efﬁcient and accurate NPQ prediction. For con-
ciseness, we identify those done in the context of network gaming. As before, most of
this work is for client-server games. In [12], a simple server-side method is proposed to
improve server location discovery and reduce probe trafﬁc. Our NPQ prediction meth-
ods focus also on reducing overall probe time since that directly affects user wait time.
Also, we not only utilize the geographic location of consoles but also previous probe
results. A ﬂooding-style server discovery mechanism is proposed in [13] to quickly lo-
cate local servers and prevent single directory server failure. That does not scale to P2P
games, since in our case several hundreds of thousands of consoles can be on-line at
any time. A server selection algorithm is proposed in [14] for distant game players who
want to play speciﬁcally with each other. Our work considers the general case of join-
ing players to any acceptable game, and thus considers NPQ data and correlators across
all on-line consoles. The geographic distribution of game servers and players is used
in [15] to redirect players to close game servers. While [16] does not consider on-line
games, they correlate geographic location and network delay to ﬁnd a host, and their
experimental result about the correlation complements ours.
Outside network games, there has been a lot of research on characterizing NPQ over
the Internet. Many of these [17,18] use PlanetLab nodes. They are mostly located in
high-performance and stable academic networks, and thus do not reﬂect the character-
istics of consumer access networks. In [19], the constancy of NPQ over time among
31 hosts is studied within a stable academic network. Our work signiﬁcantly comple-
ments prior work in terms of scale and diversity of network connectivity. Studies of
hosts behind consumer broadband lines are rare. It is extremely difﬁcult to build a large
testbed of such hosts on the Internet. While [20] characterizes network performance
between consumer broadband hosts, they use only 25 hosts. More recently, [21] studies
residential network link capacities, RTT, and loss rates through relatively large-scale
measurement studies. They use 1,894 hosts behind 11 major DSL and cable providers
in North America and Europe. Our study is much larger in scale, involving over 5.6 mil-
lion hosts. Furthermore, they do not characterize direct network connections between
pairs of broadband hosts since they measure from several vantage points located in aca-
demic networks. Techniques for estimating NPQ have been studied extensively [7,22].
Our work focuses not on the techniques itself, but on the NPQ data.
7 Conclusions
We studied the quality of network paths among Xbox 360 game consoles playing Halo
3. We focused on network delay and capacity measured between players prior to each
Internet game match-up. We studied the general characteristics of the player population
such as geographical diversity and diurnal patterns of game play. We leveraged our
understanding of these characteristics to propose three predictors for determining path
quality without additional probe trafﬁc : IP and preﬁx history-based and geography-
based. Our evaluation of these predictors showed that they can signiﬁcantly reduce the
50

number of probes and hence user wait time during matchmaking. For future work, we
plan on comparing the initial NPQ estimate to actual in-game network performance.
