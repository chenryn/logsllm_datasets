### Adversary Techniques in Container Environments

**Container API**

Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within container environments. These APIs, such as the Docker API and Kubernetes APIs, allow remote management of container resources and cluster components.

- **Docker API**: Adversaries may access the Docker API to collect logs containing credentials for cloud, container, and other resources in the environment.
- **Kubernetes API**: An adversary with sufficient permissions, such as through a pod's service account, can use the Kubernetes API to retrieve credentials from the Kubernetes API server. These credentials may include those needed for Docker API authentication or secrets from Kubernetes cluster components.

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Establish centralized logging for container and Kubernetes cluster components.
- Monitor logs for actions that could be taken to gather credentials, including the use of discovery API calls by new or unexpected users and APIs that access Docker logs.
- Detect adversary use of obtained credentials, such as through valid accounts.

### Domain Hijacking and Subdomain Takeover

**Domain Hijacking**
- **Definition**: The act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant.
- **Methods**:
  - Gaining access to an email account for the domain owner and claiming a forgotten password.
  - Social engineering a domain registration help desk.
  - Taking advantage of renewal process gaps.

**Subdomain Hijacking**
- **Definition**: Occurs when organizations have DNS entries pointing to non-existent or deprovisioned resources.
- **Impact**: Adversaries may take control of a subdomain to conduct operations with the trust associated with that domain.

**Domain Shadowing**
- **Definition**: Creating malicious subdomains under the adversary's control while keeping existing DNS records.
- **Impact**: Service disruption is minimal, making the malicious subdomains go unnoticed for long periods.

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Monitor for anomalous changes to domain registrant information and resolution.
- Focus detection efforts on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.

### SQL Stored Procedures for Persistence

**Overview**
- Adversaries may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent access to systems.
- SQL Stored Procedures are code that can be saved and reused, allowing database users to avoid rewriting frequently used SQL queries.

**Techniques**
- **Malicious Stored Procedures**: Crafted to provide a persistence mechanism in SQL database servers.
- **Command Execution**: Enable additional functionality like `xp_cmdshell` for MSSQL Server to execute operating system commands.
- **CLR Integration**: Use .NET framework languages to write stored procedures, which can execute arbitrary commands.

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Monitor for `xp_cmdshell` usage in MSSQL Servers.
- Enable audit features to log malicious startup activities.

### Network Device Authentication

**Overview**
- Adversaries may use [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) to hard code a password in the operating system, bypassing native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices.

**Techniques**
- **Modify System Image**: Implant code into the operating system image to provide access using a specific password.
- **Password Check**: Upon authentication attempts, the inserted code checks if the user input matches the hardcoded password.

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Verify the checksum of the operating system file and the image in memory.
- Focus detection efforts on closely related adversary behaviors, such as [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601).

### Disk Content Wipe

**Overview**
- Adversaries may erase the contents of storage devices to interrupt availability to system and network resources.

**Techniques**
- **Overwrite Disk Content**: Partially or completely overwrite disk content, rendering data irrecoverable.
- **Direct Access**: Use third-party drivers like [RawDisk](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0364) to directly access and overwrite disk content.

**Impact**
- Maximize impact by using worm-like features to propagate across a network, leveraging techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Monitor for attempts to read/write to sensitive locations like the partition boot sector or BIOS parameter block.
- Collect AAA logging to monitor for `erase` commands that delete critical configuration files.

### Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol

**Overview**
- Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an unencrypted network protocol other than the command and control channel.

**Techniques**
- **Obfuscation**: Use custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (e.g., base64) and embed data within protocol headers and fields.
- **Unencrypted Protocols**: Use natively unencrypted protocols such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS.

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Analyze network data for uncommon data flows.
- Monitor for processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication.
- Collect AAA logging to monitor for `copy` commands being run to exfiltrate configuration files over unencrypted protocols.

### Dylib Hijacking

**Overview**
- Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime.

**Techniques**
- **Insert Malicious Dylibs**: Insert malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.
- **Privilege Inheritance**: Dylibs are loaded into the application's address space, inheriting the application's privilege level and resources.

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Monitor file systems for moving, renaming, replacing, or modifying dylibs.
- Use tools like Objective-See's Dylib Hijacking Scanner to identify vulnerable applications.

### Downgrade System Image

**Overview**
- Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security.

**Techniques**
- **Replace Operating System File**: Download a copy of the desired version of the operating system file and reconfigure the device to boot from that file.
- **Restart the Device**: Implement the change immediately or wait until the next system restart.

**Impact**
- Weaken encryption ciphers and defensive features.
- Can be used in conjunction with [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001).

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Query the operating system for its version number and compare it to what is expected.
- Verify the integrity of the vendor-provided operating system image file.

### Process Argument Spoofing

**Overview**
- Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory.

**Techniques**
- **PEB Manipulation**: Modify the Process Environment Block (PEB) to change command-line arguments.
- **Process Hollowing**: Spawn a process in a suspended state with benign arguments, then override the PEB to modify the arguments.

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Monitor for process creation and access/modifications of these processes via Windows API calls.
- Analyze process behavior to determine if a process is performing actions that do not align with its logged command-line arguments.

**Techniques**
- **Environment Variable Manipulation**: Set `COR_PROFILER` at system, user, or process scopes to load a malicious profiling DLL.
- **Persistence and Privilege Escalation**: Use `COR_PROFILER` to establish persistence and elevate privileges.

**Detection and Mitigation**
- Monitor the Registry for changes to `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH`.
- Monitor for new suspicious unmanaged profiling DLLs loading into .NET processes.
