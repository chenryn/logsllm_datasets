3.2.2 Token to Attacker’s Antenna
After activating the token the next step is to retrieve the to-
ken’s response. The best result for de was obtained using
the A5 antenna with the 1 W ampliﬁer and is shown in Fig-
ure 3(b) along with a comparative measurement at roughly
half the maximum distance. This was a surprising result
as we expected the range to increase but we only achieved
de = 50 cm using the same antenna with the 4 W ampli-
ﬁer and de = 135 cm using the same ampliﬁer with the A4
antenna. This could be attributed to a number of factors.
The amplitude of the load modulation was absolute and not
proportional to the amplitude of the carrier signal. As the
carrier is ampliﬁed the load modulation effect gets smaller
relative to the entire signal. Essentially the modulation in-
dex is decreased each time the carrier is ampliﬁed and the
SNR decreases accordingly. This was the same for tokens
from different vendors with the same card-type form factor.
The amplitude of the reﬂected load modulation decreased
as dp increased. Even though the token can be activated at
the distances mentioned before it had to be moved closer
to the loop antenna to create a sufﬁcient effect in order to
be eavesdropped. That negated the advantage of larger an-
tenna/ampliﬁer combinations. Analysing the spectrum of
the transmitted signal from the reader showed some carrier
leakage into the sidebands. When the carrier is ampliﬁed
the receiver has difﬁculty isolating the sidebands and the
input ampliﬁers saturate before the small data signals can
be seen. In a specially design attacking reader care could be
taken as to the spectral properties of the carrier signal which
should allow for the recovery of smaller sideband signals,
hence increasing dp and de. The threat of this attack seems
slightly diminished as dp ended up quite small for the best
case of de. That said, 15 cm is enough to execute an at-
tack in a crowded area and easily allows reading of a card
in somebody’s pocket or bag.
4. Relay Attacks
This is any attack where information passes through
the attacker’s hardware on its route between the legitimate

reader and the token and presents a practical example of
the grand master chess problem. An attacker can use two
transponders in order to relay the information that a reader
and a token exchange during a cryptographic challenge-
response protocol. A proxy-token device is placed near
the real reader and a proxy-reader device is placed near the
real token, possibly unknown to its holder. Information can
therefore be forwarded over a great distance if a suitable
communication medium is chosen between the proxy-token
and proxy-reader. As a result, the reader will report that
it has veriﬁed the presence of a remote token and provide
access to the attacker.
We implemented a practical relay attack and achieved a
relay distance of 50 m using a cheap FSK RF link [9]. The
timing constraints were not as strict as deﬁned in the stan-
dards, and allowed sufﬁcient time to relay messages, even
with the 20 μs delay our hardware introduced. The neces-
sary hardware parts were easily obtainable and the cost of
the whole system was well under $100, with most of the
cost being an OEM RFID reader. The system was then
modiﬁed using a FPGA development board to implement
an adjustable delay so that the maximum attacking window
could be determined.
It was possible to buffer and delay
the data for a period of time on the condition that it was
clocked out on the rising edge of the reader’s clock. We
systematically increased the delay and tested the system by
reading the token’s ID. At 750 μs the system still functioned
as normal. Errors started occurring when the delay reached
1 ms and no data was read once the delay reached 5 ms.
The allowed time delay might be dependent on the reader
and its setup, so the experiment should be repeated with a
few readers to get an accurate result. We also considered the
possibility that an attacker could alter data before relaying it
back to the reader. Using the same experimental system we
successfully modiﬁed a token’s ID response, which is unen-
crypted and only uses a byte wise XOR for integrity. This
offers possibilities for further work on how this could effect
older payments systems using stream ciphers with limited
integrity checking.
5. Countermeasures
We brieﬂy discuss how tokens are protected and to what
extend the current mechanisms and card data can be com-
promised by the attacks mentioned in the previous sections.
Passive eavesdropping could be negated by implementing
conﬁdentiality and privacy mechanisms while active scan-
ning is prevented by authentication. Papers on RFID secu-
rity concentrate on minimalist cryptography protocols for
EPC type tags. Suggested authentication and privacy proto-
cols use pseudonyms and hash locking [17,23]. Further pro-
tocols suggest modifying the anti-collision protocols [28]
or providing blocking tags [19]. Few of these ideas are
currently implemented with the EPC standard only speci-
fying a 32-bit password and kill code option to prevent ac-
tive scanning. ISO 14443 tokens generally provide stronger
algorithms such as RSA, DES, AES with some vendors pro-
viding proprietary algorithms, e.g. Philips Crypto1. These
tokens have a ﬁxed Unique Identiﬁer (UID) used for anti-
collision that could be used to track a speciﬁc card and the
subsequent Protocol and Parameter Selection (PPS) could
provide more information about the origin/use of the card
before security mechanisms are invoked. Some access con-
trol systems, despite the cryptographic capability of their
tokens, simply use the UID for access control purposes in
the same way as old style proximity cards and are therefore
vulnerable to a simple replay attack. The International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) new password standard, us-
ing ISO 14443 tokens, only speciﬁes mandatory “Passive
Authentication” which only proves that the data is authen-
tic. “Basic Access Control”, which would provide conﬁden-
tiality, is an optional feature and if not implemented would
allow the attacker to eavesdrop the passport owner’s per-
sonal information [18].
Relay attacks cannot easily be prevented by crypto-
graphic protocols that operate at the application layer of
an RFID protocol stack. An attacker executing a relay at-
tack cannot avoid causing a delay in the system. Distance-
bounding or secure-positioning protocols are therefore a
possible defense. Brands and Chaum [4] described the ﬁrst
distance-bounding protocol based on timing the single-bit
round-trip delay in a cryptographic challenge-response ex-
change in order to prevent relay attacks. Since then a num-
ber of protocols based on technology such as RF [3], Re-
ceived Signal Strength (RSS) [8] and Ultrasound [25] have
been proposed. These protocols are not ideal for RFID de-
vices as some require excessive power and processing re-
sources while little attention was paid to practical consider-
ations such as noise and error correction. Kuhn et al. [10]
proposed a new distance bounding protocol for RFID de-
vices. Further research in this area might lead to protocols
with sufﬁcient resolution to prevent unauthorized readers
from accessing tokens from outside a trusted boundary.
6. Conclusion
The RF communication interface of ‘proximity’ tokens
are vulnerable to practical attacks. We showed that an
eavesdropper can intercept a two-way communication se-
quence between a legitimate reader and token from 4 m and
that it is also possible to scan a token’s response from ap-
proximate 1.5 m aways after activating it from a distance of
15 cm using a magnetic loop antenna. We also showed how
relay attacks can successfully spoof the location of authen-
tication tokens and that the permissible system delay further
provides an opportunity for attacks on the system’s integrity

by allowing enough time for the modiﬁcation of legitimate
communication sequences.
Currently these attacks are only at the proof of concept
stage and it is likely that further work would yield better
results, e.g. digital signal processing or specially designed
receivers could all increase the eavesdropping range. Nev-
ertheless the current implementations still present a credi-
ble threat as these are within the capabilities of an attacker
with a limited budget and some RF/electronic knowledge.
It would also be interesting to see similar results for tokens
using standards other than ISO 14443 A, e.g. ISO 14443 B.
We hope that the results we presented can serve as a start-
ing point for more research into security aspects of RFID
communication interfaces.
