User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题File Server Auditing/Logging I am currently setting up a file server with win2k8 server r2 (storage server)
I was wondering is there something I can use to audit/log what happens?

For example

JSmith moved Folder1 to Root.
JSmith created XYZ folder.

etc.
Directory Monitor doesn't show users (which is important)

Obviously something with low overhead would be awesome too.

Thanks in advance

Assistant: If you are open to spending a little bit of money to get reports that are easily generated and easy to read, I highly recommend File System Auditor by Scriptlogic.

This software lets you create custom reports showing any activity in any folder, by any user, and any type of event. It is orders of magnitude easier to read and use than the default auditing built into Windows Server. I use it on my file server which is running Server 2003 but I am sure it will run great on 2008 as well.
