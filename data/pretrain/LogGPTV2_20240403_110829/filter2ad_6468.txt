## Abstract
We analyze multi-relational social interaction networks in a large-scale commercial Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). Our study is based on data from AION, the world's second most-played MMORPG with 3.4 million subscribers as of mid-2010, created and serviced by NCSoft, Inc. We construct and characterize six distinct interactivity networks (Friend, Private Messaging, Party Invitation, Trade, Mail, and Shop), each representing diverse player interaction types.

## 1. Introduction
It has been reported that more than 15 million people worldwide enjoy MMORPGs [1], which feature online social arenas in fantastical settings where gamers can engage in individual or group battles, exchange or trade items, or simply socialize with one another via in-game communication channels. Given that the complexity and variety of in-game interactions may now rival those of real-world interactions, the digital archive of online activities opens up an attractive avenue for researchers to gain a deep understanding of human social behaviors. However, such research is often hindered by the lack of access to data.

In this work, we investigate the multi-relational and collective aspects of MMORPG players' interactions based on data collected from AION, the world's second largest MMORPG from NCSoft, Inc. Specifically, we construct and characterize six distinct interactivity networks, each representing diverse player interaction types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes multi-relational social networks in a large-scale commercial MMORPG.

Our study is based on anonymized database dumps from one AION server out of 41 identically designed but independently running parallel game worlds/servers. The dataset includes all in-game interactions between player characters for 87 days in mid-2010. Each interaction record contains anonymized IDs of the sender and receiver, and the type of the interaction, which falls into one of the following six categories:

1. **Friend (F):** A directed edge is created from user A to B when A adds B to A’s buddy list.
2. **Whisper (W):** A directed edge is created from user A to B when A sends a private message to B.
3. **Party Invitation (P):** A directed edge is created from user A to B when A invites B to join A’s party. A party is a group of up to six players that can carry out missions or engage in battles as a team.
4. **Trade (T):** A directed edge is formed from A to B when A requests a trade of items to B, and B accepts it.
5. **Mail (M):** An edge is formed from user A to B when A sends a mail to B.
6. **Shop (S):** Users can enter a private market mode, becoming a merchant (and unable to do any other actions while in the mode) who can announce publicly the list of items for sale. Other users can then buy items from the merchant using in-game currency, in which case a directed edge is drawn from the buyer to the merchant.

## 2. Results
Table 1 summarizes the basic network characteristics, including the number of nodes, edges, percentage of nodes and edges in the Giant Connected Component (GCC) [2], network diameter, average path length, and average degree for each interaction type. We see that Party Invitation, a truly social activity, is the most prevalent interaction, while Shop is the least prevalent. Note that the GCCs take up approximately 50% of the nodes and edges across the networks, while the second largest connected components are very similar in size. This phenomenon is expected in AION due to its Realm-vs-Realm design, where a player belongs to either of two major tribes (Heavenly and Diabolical) that cannot communicate with each other.

The clustering coefficients [2] in the networks are shown in Figure 1(a), where Trade, Party, Whisper, and Friend networks exhibit clustering coefficients \(C > 0.03\), higher than others. In Figure 1(b), we show how many factors these coefficients are larger than expected in randomized networks with the same number of nodes and edges. Again, we see that the four social-type networks (F, W, P, T) show factors of 20 or larger, indicating a strong clustering tendency.

When we inspect the reciprocity, only two of the social-type networks (F and W) are highly reciprocated, while the other two (P and T) are generally not. This presents an interesting observation: when one invites others to a Party, becoming a "Party Leader," it is not necessarily the case that the invitee will at some point invite the original initiator to join their Party. Similarly, one who initiates a Trade will not necessarily be invited to a Trade by the same person. This suggests that a preferred partner of Party and Trade activities in a gamer’s mind tends not to reciprocate the feeling. Perhaps the level of strategic thinking necessary for starting a Party or Trade for items is higher, making it more likely for one to join stronger players on missions, compared to Friend or Whisper activities that do not require as much strategizing.

Our current ongoing work includes further in-depth investigation of degree distributions [2], triangular motif statistics [5], and the network link and node overlap [4]. We believe these studies will shed light on the correlations and overlap between different types of networks, which in turn would help us understand the organization principles of the social system. In this paper, we report the very first results from the analysis of massive interaction data from AION. We believe there are many promising avenues for more detailed research, for understanding not only human social behavior in a virtual world but also offline behavior that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to study.
