ABSTRACT
We analyze multi-relational social interaction networks in a
large-scale commercial Massively Multiplayer Online Role-
Playing Game (MMORPG). Our work is based on data from
AION, currently the world’s second most-played MMORPG
with 3.4 million subscribers as of mid 2010, created and
serviced by NCSoft, Inc. We construct and characterize six
distinct interactivity networks (Friend, Private Messaging,
Party invitation, Trade, Mail, and Shop), each representing
diverse player interaction types.

INTRODUCTION
It has been reported that more than 15 million people
worldwide enjoy MMORPGs [1] that feature online social
arenas in fantastical settings where gamers can engage in
individual or group battles, exchange or trade items, or sim-
ply socialize with one another via in-game communication
channels. Given that the complexity and variety of in-game
interactions may now rival those of real-world interactions,
the digital archive of online activities opens up an attractive
avenue to researchers for a deep understanding of human
social behaviors. Yet, such research is often hindered by the
lack of access to the data. In this work we investigate multi-
relational social and collective aspects of MMORPG players’
interactions based on data collected from AION1, the world’s
second largest MMORPG from NCSoft, Inc. Speciﬁcally,
we construct and charactersize six distinct interactivity net-
works, each representing diverse player interaction types. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that analyzes

multi-relational social networks in a large-scale commercial
MMORPG.
Our study is based on the anonymized database dumps
from one AION server/world out of 41 identically designed
but independently running parallel game worlds/servers. The
dataset includes all in-game interactions between player char-
acters for 87 days, in mid 2010. Each interaction record
contains anonymized IDs of the sender and receiver, and
the type of the interaction record, most of which fall into
one of the following six categories: (i) Friend F: A directed
edge is created from user A to B when A adds B to A’s
buddy list. (ii) Whisper W: A directed edge is created from
user A to B when A sends a private message to B. (iii) Party
Invitation P: A directed edge is created from user A to user
B when A invites B to join his party. A party is a group of
up to six players that can carry out missions or engage in
battles as a team. (iv) Trade T: A directed edge is formed
from A to B when A requests a trade of items to B, then B
accepts it. (v) Mail M: An edge is formed from user A to
B when A sends a mail to B. (vi) Shop S: users can enter
a private market mode, becoming a merchant (and unable
to do any other actions while in the mode) who can an-
nounce publicly the list of items for sale. Other users can
then buy items from the merchant using in-game currency,
in which case a directed edge is drawn from the buyer to the
merchant.
2. RESULTS
Table 12 shows how many gamers were engaged in each
interaction type, and the number of interactions (for sim-
plicity, we have not considered weights on the edges, which
is the frequency of the interactions between user pairs). We
see that the Party invitation, a truly social activity, is the
most prevalent interaction while Shop is the least so. Note
that the Giant Connected Components (GCCs) [2] take up
approximately 50% of the nodes and the edges across the
networks, while the second largest connected components
(not shown) are very similar in size. While this phenomenon
would be extremely unusual, it is expected in AION, since
it features a Realm-vs-Realm design where a player belongs
to either of two major tribes (Heavenly and Diabolical) that
cannot communicate with each other. The clustering coef-
ﬁcients [2] in the networks are shown in Fig. 1(a), where
Trade, Party, Whisper, and Friend networks exhibit cluster-
ing coeﬃcients C > 0.03, higher than others. In Fig. 1(b),
we show by how many factors they are larger than expected
2Due to space limitations, we refer readers to [2] for the
deﬁnitions of all the graph measures used.

When we inspect the reciprocity, however, only two of
the social-type networks (F and W) are highly reciprocated,
while the other two (P and T) are generally not. This
presents an interesting observation of the two interactions:
when one invites others to a Party, becoming a “Party Leader”,
it is not necessarily the case that the invitee will at some
point invite the original initiator to join their Party. Also,
one who initiates a Trade will not necessarily be invited to a
Trade by the same person. It indicates that a preferred part-
ner of Party and Trade activities in a gamer’s mind tends
not to reciprocate the feeling; perhaps the level of strategic
thinking necessary for starting a Party or Trade for items is
higher – it is conceivable that one may be more interested
in joining stronger players when one goes out on a mission
– than for Friend or Whisper activities that do not require
as much strategizing.
Our current on-going work includes further in-depth inves-
tigation of degree distributions [2], triangular motif statis-
tics [5], and the network link and node overlap [4], etc. We
believe they will shed light on the correlations and overlap
between diﬀerent types of networks, which in turn would
help us understand the organization principles of the social
system. In thie paper we reported on the very ﬁrst results
from the analysis of massive interaction data from AION.
We believe that there are many promising avenues for more
detailed research, for understanding not only human social
behavior themselves in a virtual world, but also oﬄine be-
havior otherwise diﬃcult or impossible to study.

in randomized networks with the same number of nodes and
edges. Again, we see that the four social-type networks (F,
W, P, T) show factors of 20 or larger indicating the strong
clustering tendency.
The Pearson correlation coeﬃcients [3] between the in-
and the out-degree of each node, and the reciprocity [2] of
interactions are shown in Fig. 2. First, we see that in the
four social-type networks (F, W, P, T) the in- and the out-
degrees of nodes are high correlated (green, 0.6 or higher);
if a user has a long buddy list, then they are likely to be in
many buddy lists themselves, and people engaging in Party
or Trade initiation are also likely to be actively invited to
Parties and Trade. Again, Shop and Mail show very small
in- and out-degree correlation. The case of Shop is due to
the nature of the interaction and the preferred role that
users take: Since a high in-degree represents the role of a
merchant, the low correlation means that users who prefer
to be one is seldom a buyer from a merchant, and vice versa.
In Mail, on the other hand, we found that spammers who
send many mails indiscriminately and receive few have a
large eﬀect on the statistics.
