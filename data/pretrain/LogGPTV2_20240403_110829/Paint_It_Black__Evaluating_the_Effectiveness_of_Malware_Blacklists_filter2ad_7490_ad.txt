**Coverage Analysis:**
Three blacklists operated by antivirus (AV) vendors show significantly better performance. The union of these blacklists detects at least 70% of the domains for each malware family, with over 90% coverage for seven out of the 13 families. 

**Individual Blacklist Performance:**
Table 5 highlights the two best-performing blacklists: SBD, managed by Bitdefender, and SMA, by McAfee. Surprisingly, combining these two blacklists significantly increases overall coverage for many families. Due to space constraints, we do not list the remaining two blacklists, but it is worth noting that Norton's performance is similar to Bitdefender and McAfee, while Browserdefender fails to detect any domain for most families and covers only 2-7% of the domains for other malware families.

**Reaction Time Analysis:**
For domains observed in Sandnet and covered by SMal, we estimated the reaction time of the blacklists. This measures the delay between a domain being seen in Sandnet and its addition to the blacklists. Since the domains could have been malicious before being observed in Sandnet, the reaction times are lower bounds. We used passive DNS (pDNS) records and VirusTotal analysis results to investigate the history of each domain. We aggregated pDNS records for 81.3% of all domains and obtained information from VirusTotal for 98% of the domains.

**Key Findings:**
- **Abuse.ch Blacklists:**
  - 23.3% of the domains were listed before appearing in Sandnet.
  - 37.9% of the domains were blacklisted before appearing in VirusTotal.
  - 64.7% of the domains were seen in Sandnet and added to the blacklists on the same day.
  - 80.2% of the Sandnet domains had a reaction time of less than a week, with 96.6% of the domains included within 30 days.

- **Other Blacklists:**
  - UrlBlacklist: 53.5% of the domains had a reaction time higher than a month.
  - MW-Domains: 39.7% of the domains had a reaction time of at least 30 days.
  - After four months, the coverage of all three blacklists was still below 90%.

**DGA-Based Domains:**
Malware using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) poses additional challenges for blacklist operators. DGA-based domains are valid for a limited time and often change. Ideally, blacklists should include these domains before they become valid. We evaluated the coverage of DGA-based domains for five prevalent malware families, implementing the DGAs after obtaining the algorithms or through reverse engineering. Four families generate domains daily, while ZeuS P2P domains are valid for 7 days. We measured the completeness and determined the reaction time for each family, as well as the rate of registered domains in SMal using recorded DNS data.

**Summary:**
- **SMal:**
  - Contains all domains listed by any of the 15 public blacklists since 2012.
  - Includes DGA-based domains that were valid in the past.

**Figure 1: Reaction Times of Selected Blacklists**

- **Y-axis:** Reaction time per blacklist entry in days.
- **X-axis:** Ratio of domains with this reaction time.
- **Negative y-values:** Domains first seen in blacklists, then in Sandnet, pDNS, or VirusTotal.
- **Positive y-values:** Blacklists lagged behind.

**Graph Key:**
- **UrlBlacklist / SANDNET (all families)**
- **Cybercrime / SANDNET (all families)**
- **MW-Domains / SANDNET (all families)**
- **Abuse.ch Trackers / pDNS (Palevo, SpyEye, ZeuS)**
- **Abuse.ch Trackers / SANDNET (Palevo, SpyEye, ZeuS)**
- **Abuse.ch Trackers / VirusTotal (Palevo, SpyEye, ZeuS)**

The low number of domains appearing in Sandnet after being blacklisted (negative y-values) indicates that our ground truth dataset is up-to-date.
