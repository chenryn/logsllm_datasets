User: How to design a set of API interfaces to realize data interaction and function calls between different systems? Please provide a practical case based on API design.
Assistant: API (Application Programming Interface) is a bridge for data interaction and function calls between different systems. The API should be designed to be easy to use, and to be scalable and maintainable so that it can be easily extended and modified in the future. The following are some common API interface design principles: 1. RESTful API: RESTful API is an API design specification based on HTTP protocol and REST architectural style. A RESTful API uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to name resources, HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) actions to perform operations on resources, and HTTP status codes to identify the results of operations. 2. Version control: In the design of the API, version control should be implemented so that existing programs will not be affected when the API is updated. You can specify the version of the API by adding a version number to the URL or using an HTTP header. 3. Parameter design: In the design of the API, all parameters should be placed in the URL as much as possible, so that the API data transmission can be more concise and clear. Parameter optionality should be implemented using query strings. At the same time, API parameters should be checked and validated to ensure that the data entered is legal. 4. Error handling: In the design of the API, exceptions should be handled effectively. Standard HTTP error codes and error response formats should be used to return information about errors to the user. An error response should contain an error code, error message, and error reason. 5. Authentication: The API interface design should implement authentication and permission control to prevent unauthorized users from accessing and changing data. Identity can be verified using, for example, OAuth authentication. The following is a practical case, which is an online store system based on RESTful API, mainly including the following API interfaces: 1. Get user information API: get basic user information. Authorization: Logged in user. Request method: GET. Request URL: /users/{user_id}. 2. Get commodity information API: Get the basic information of the commodity. Authorization: Any user. Request method: GET. Request URL: /products/{product_id}. 3. Add order information API: add a new order. Authorization: Logged in user. Request method: POST. Request URL: /orders. Parameters: order information. Return value: order number. 4. Get order information API: Get the basic information of the order. Authorization: Logged in user. Request method: GET. Request URL: /orders/{order_id}. 5. Confirm Order API: The user confirms the order. Authorization: Logged in user. Request method: PUT. Request URL: /orders/{order_id}/confirm. 6. Cancel order API: The user cancels the order. Authorization: Logged in user. Request method: PUT. Request URL: /orders/{order_id}/cancel. 7. Confirm receipt API: User confirms receipt. Authorization: Logged in user. Request method: PUT. Request URL: /orders/{order_id}/received. These API interfaces can process accounts, commodities, orders, etc. for the online store system, and realize various operations through standardized HTTP protocol and RESTful format. Such an API interface is not only easy to use, but also has good scalability and maintainability.
