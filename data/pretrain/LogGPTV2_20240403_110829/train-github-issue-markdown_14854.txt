When adding a host entry using the hosts module, if the name matches an
existing entry with a different ip, the entire entry line is removed, even if
it contains other aliases. I would expect it to leave the other entries in
place.
Ever more so, if the entry for the current name/ip exists AND the name exists
in another entry, the other entry line is removed and a second instance of the
existing entry is added.
with `ip=192.168.3.10 hostname=vagrant-chef-server state=present`
    127.0.0.1   vagrant-chef-server vagrant-chef-server localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
    ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
bacame:
    192.168.3.10 vagrant-chef-server
    ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
and if I fix that file to put 127.0.0.1 back, the next run produces:
    192.168.3.10 vagrant-chef-server
    ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
    192.168.3.10 vagrant-chef-server
