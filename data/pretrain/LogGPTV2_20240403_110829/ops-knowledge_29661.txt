Question: You are tasked with enhancing the security of a mobile application by implementing fingerprint authentication for users on Android devices. Considering the best practices for biometric authentication, which of the following approaches provides the most secure method for using fingerprint data to authorize user access to a remote service?
"A": "Use the deprecated FingerprintManager class to authenticate users and store the authentication token in Shared Preferences.",
"B": "Implement BiometricPrompt with a symmetric key in the Android KeyStore, unlocked by the user's fingerprint and set with setUserAuthenticationRequired(true).",
"C": "Create an asymmetric key pair in the KeyStore and store the private key unencrypted on the device's internal storage.",
"D": "Utilize the BiometricManager class to check for biometric hardware availability only, without involving any cryptographic operations."
Answer: B
