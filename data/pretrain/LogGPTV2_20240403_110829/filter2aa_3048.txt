IF ( Taiwan War Break out)
+
Then (what China will most likely face)
▪
Cyber  (Propaganda, Economic, Media, Penetration , Psychological )
▪
Space  (Satellite )
▪
Air  (Regular strike , Airborne and landing, Electronic warfare)
▪
Ocean ( Pacific Fleet )
▪
Land (Direct  Force Insertion, “Back Stabbing”)
