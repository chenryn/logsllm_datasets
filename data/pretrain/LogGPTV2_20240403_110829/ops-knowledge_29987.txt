User: Please explain what the Web Socket (WebSocket) protocol is and give an example of how it works in practical applications.
Assistant: WebSocket is a network protocol for bidirectional communication over a single TCP connection. In the Web Socket protocol, data is transmitted in binary format, rather than HTTP-based requests and responses. The role of the Web Socket protocol is to allow web applications to achieve real-time interaction. In traditional web applications, the browser usually collects data by sending HTTP requests to the server. When data is available, the server includes them in the HTTP response, and the browser renders them on the page. The disadvantage of this mode is that it has a certain delay, and the client needs to constantly ask the server whether new data has arrived. The Web Socket protocol allows the browser to send data directly to the server without waiting for the server to send a response by establishing a persistent connection between the client and the server. In this way, web applications can receive and process data in real time without having to wait for HTTP requests and responses. For example, Web Sockets can be used in an online chat application, allowing users to send and receive messages in real time without having to wait for a page refresh. In some of the latest browsers, the Web Socket API also allows the use of JavaScript code to implement Web Socket functions on the client side. This allows web applications to communicate directly using Web Sockets without having to use other technologies like XHR.
