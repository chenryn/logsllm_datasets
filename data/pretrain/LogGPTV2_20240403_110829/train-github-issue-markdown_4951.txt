Hi, I'm noticing that the back button doesn't trigger getInitialProps.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Go to https://wecured.com/condition/depression
  2. Click on 'Symptoms' tab, which will trigger a shallow client transition.
  3. Click on 'hay fever' on the left rail, which will trigger a client transition.
  4. Press back.  
Expected: page should end up on the depression page with symptoms tab.  
Actual: page ended up on hay fever on the symptoms tab.
I did some debugging and found that this is because getInitialProps wasn't
called.
