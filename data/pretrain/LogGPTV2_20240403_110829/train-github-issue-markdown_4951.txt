Subject: Issue with Back Button Not Triggering `getInitialProps`

Hi,

I have noticed that the back button does not trigger the `getInitialProps` method. After searching through the issues in this repository, I believe this is a unique problem.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to [https://wecured.com/condition/depression](https://wecured.com/condition/depression).
2. Click on the 'Symptoms' tab, which will trigger a shallow client transition.
3. Click on 'Hay Fever' in the left rail, which will trigger another client transition.
4. Press the back button.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The page should return to the depression page with the 'Symptoms' tab active.

**Actual Behavior:**
- The page returns to the 'Hay Fever' page with the 'Symptoms' tab active.

### Debugging Findings

During my investigation, I discovered that `getInitialProps` is not being called when the back button is pressed, which is causing the unexpected behavior.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Best regards,
