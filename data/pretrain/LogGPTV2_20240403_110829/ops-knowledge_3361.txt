User: I'm working on a practical work for college, and I have to develop a web-app that could be used by all the teachers from my province. 
The application should let the users (teachers) manage some information related to their daily duties. One of the requirements is that I must use 
Google App Engine platform for developing and hosting the web application. 
I have 2 months to finish the work.
I have some intermediate knowledge of C++, so what language (Python or Java ) and web framework do you think would the best to 
develop the application in less time? 
I know this is not a strictly programming questions, but please don't delete this post at least until I get a 
few answer in order to have an idea of how to proceed.
Many thanks in advance!
Assistant: I would recommend using Python + Django framework. I love Java, but for the Google App Engine there is much more documentation online for Python.
