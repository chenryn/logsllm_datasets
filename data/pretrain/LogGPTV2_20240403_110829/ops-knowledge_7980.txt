User: I am using Python 2.7.5+ on my Linux Mint to write simple programs as .py files and running them in Konsole Terminal. These work fine on my computer, but I need to share them with a friend using Windows (IDLE I suppose) and wonder if these will work as they are without modification.
The programs start with the usual #!/usr/bin/python, you know.
Assistant: Depends on the script. Unless you use anything os-specific, you are golden.
In the standard library most of the modules are totally os-agnostic, and for the rest the rule of thumb is - "if it is possible to provide the same functionality across *nix and windows, it has probably been done".
Python actually makes it pretty easy to write portable programs. Even file paths manipulation is pretty portable if you do it right - os.path.sep instead of '/', os.path.join instead of string concatenation etc.
Notable exceptions are 

sockets - windows sockets are bit different
multiprocessing - windows does not have fork(), that may or may not be a problem.
Needless to say, things related to username, hostname and such.
os and sys are a mixed bag - you should read the compatibility notes in the docs.
Everything packaging and distribution-related.
