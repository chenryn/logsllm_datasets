# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18956.1000
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.3.2171.0
    Any other software? No other software relevant I believe
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Configure a custom `tabTitle` for cmd or PowerShell shells in the profiles.json file, e.g.:
    [...]
    "tabTitle" : "Windows PowerShell",
    [...]
  2. Open a cmd or PowerShell tab, verify the customized `tabTitle` is appearing.
  3. Try to set a custom title programmatically from within the shell, e.g. in PowerShell:
    $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = 'Custom Title :)'
    # OR
    [Console]::Title = 'Custom Title 2 :)'
or in command prompt:
    TITLE Custom Title :)
# Expected behavior
We should be able to programmatically overwrite the customized `tabTitle` set
in the profiles.json file - programmatically setting the tab title DOES work
when no custom `tabTitle` is specified in profiles.json.
I believe the order of precedence should be, from lowest to highest:
  1. Default title / executable path
  2. Gets overwritten by `tabTitle` property in profiles.json
  3. Gets overwritten by scripts or programs setting their own titles
# Actual behavior
When a customized `tabTitle` is specified, it cannot be overwriten or changed
from within the shell.
