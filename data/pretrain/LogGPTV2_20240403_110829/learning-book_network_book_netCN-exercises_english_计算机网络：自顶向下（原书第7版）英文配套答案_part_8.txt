Based on the above table, we find that after 1000 msec, C1’s and C2’s window sizes
are 1 segment each.
b) No. In the long run, C1's bandwidth share is roughly twice as that of C2’s, because
C1 has shorter RTT, only half of that of C2, so C1 can adjust its window size twice as
fast as C2. If we look at the above table, we can see a cycle every 200msec, e.g. from
850msec to 1000msec,inclusive.Within a cycle,the sending rate of C1 is
(40+20+40+20) = 120, which is thrice as large as the sending of C2 given by
(10+10+10+10) = 40.
Problem 51
a）
Similarly as in last problem, we can compute their window sizes over time in the
following table. Both C1 and C2 have the same window size 2 after 2200msec.

b) Yes, this is due to the AIMD algorithm of TCP and that both connections have the
same RTT.
c)Yes, this can be seen clearly from the above table. Their max window size is 2.
d) No, this synchronization won’t help to improve link utilization,as these two
connections act as a single connection oscillating between min and max window size.
Thus, the link is not fully utilized (recall we assume this link has no buffer). One
possible way to break the synchronization is to add a finite buffer to the link and
randomly drop packets in the buffer before buffer overflow. This will cause different
connections cut their window sizes at different times. There are many AQM (Active
Queue Management) techniques to do that, such as RED (Random Early Detect), PI
(Proportional and Integral AQM), AVQ (Adaptive Virtual Queue),and REM
(Random Exponential Marking), etc.
Problem52
Note that W represents the maximum window size.
First we can find the total number of segments sent out during the interval when TCP
changes its window size from W/2 up to and include W. This is given by:
S W/2 + (W/2)*(1+α) +(W/2)*(I+α)² + (W/2)*(I+α)² + .. + (W/2)*(I +α)
We find k=log(1+α)2, then S=W*(2 α+ I)/(2 αx).
Loss rate L is given by:
L= 1/S = (2α) / (W*(2α+ /) ).
The time that TCP takes to increase its window size from W/2 to W is given by:
k*RT7= (log(1+a)2) * RTT,
which is clearly independent of TCP's average throughput.
Note, TCP's average throughput is given by:
（X(+）7) /SSW （X(+）)/SSSW

RTT·√L
where the square root of L appears in the denominator.
Problem53
Let’s assume 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time. From the TCP throughput
,we have
RTT-√L
0 ((）bss1)/ (s 8001)。1=sdq 01
sqrt(L) = 14640 bits / (10^9 bits) = 0.00001464, or
L = 2.14 * 10~(-10)
Problem54
An advantage of using the earlier values of cwnd and ssthresh at t is that TCP would
not have to go through slow start and congestion avoidance to ramp up to the throughput
value obtained at t. A disadvantage of using these values is that they may be no longer
accurate. In particular, if the path has become more congested between ti and t2, the
sender will send a large window’s worth of segments into an already (more) congested
path.
Problem55
a) The server will send its response to Y.
b) The server can be certain that the client is indeed at Y. If it were at some other
address spoofing Y, the SYNACK would have been sent to the address Y, and the
TCP in that host would not send the TCP ACK segment back. Even if the attacker
correct server sequence number (since the server uses random initial sequence
numbers.)
Problem56
a)Referring to the figure below, we see that the total delay is

b)Similarly, the delay in this case is:
RTT+RTT + S/R + RTT + S/R + RTT + S/R + RTT + 8S/R = 5RTT +11 S/R
c)Similarly, the delay in this case is:

1.A network-layer packet is a datagram. A router forwards a packet based on the
packet’s IP (layer 3) address. A link-layer switch forwards a packet based on the
packet's MAC (layer 2) address.
2.The main function of the data plane is packet forwarding, which is to forward
datagrams from their input links to their output links. For example, the data plane's
 sud uengouu  sud d sod nu
at a router, perform link-layer function to interoperate with the link layer at the other
side of the incoming link, and perform lookup function at the input ports.
The main function of the control plane is routing, which is to determine the paths a
packet takes from its source to its destination. A control plane is responsible for
communicating with remote controllers, and performing management functions.
3. The key differences between routing and forwarding is that forwarding is a router's
and forwarding takes place at very short timescales (typically a few nanoseconds),
and thus is typically implemented in hardware. Routing refers to the network-wide
process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from sources to
destinations. Routing takes place on much longer timescales (typically seconds), and
is often implemented in software.
4.The role of the forwarding table within a router is to hold entries to determine the
outgoing link interface to which an arriving packet will be forwarded via switching
fabric.
5.The service model of the Internet’s network layer is best-effort service. With this
service model, there is no guarantee that packets will be received in the order in
which they were sent, no guarantee of their eventual delivery, no guarantee on the
end-to-end delay, and no minimal bandwidth guarantee.
6.Input port, switching fabric, and output ports are implemented in hardware, because
their datagram-processing functionality is far too fast for software implementation. A
routing processor inside a traditional router uses software for executing routing
protocols, maintaining routing tables and attached link state information, and
computing the forwarding table of a router. In addition, a routing processor in a SDN
router also relies on software for communication with a remote controller in order to
receive forwarding table entries and install them in the router's input ports.
Data plane is usually implemented in hardware due to the requirement of fast
processing, e.g., at nanosecond time scale. Control plane is usually implemented in
software and operates at the millisecond or second timescale, for example, for

executing routing protocols, responding to attached links that go up or down,
communicating with remote controllers, and performing management functions.
7.With the shadow copy, the forwarding lookup is made locally, at each input port,
without invoking the centralized routing processor. Such a decentralized approach
avoids creating a lookup processing bottleneck at a single point within the router.
8. Destination-based forwarding means that a datagram arriving at a router will be
forwarded to an output interface based on only the final destination of the datagram.
Generalized-forwarding means that besides its final destination, other factors
associated with a datagram is also considered when a router determines the output
interface for the datagram.Software definednetworking adopts generalized
forwarding. for example,forwarding decision can be based on a datagram’s
TCP/UDP source or destination port numbers, besides its destination IP address.
9.A router uses longest prefix matching to determine which link interface a packet will
be forwarded to if the packet's destination address matches two or more entries in the
forwarding table. That is, the packet will be forwarded to the link interface that has
the longest prefix match with the packet’s destination.
