An important task for the future will be to begin testing
these interpretations so that we can better understand what
psychological processes are responsible for lessening concerns
about privacy and the boundary conditions within which they
operate. Possibly, more extensive interventions involving, for
example, a cover story about the harmful effects of photo
sharing on the mental health of an individual would result
in greater rather than lesser concerns for the privacy of others.
B. Effects of photo valence, history of photo sharing, and
gender
In spite of these counter-intuitive ﬁndings related to the
behavioral
interventions, most of the other ﬁndings from
this study were consistent with our expectations. First, the
emotional valence associated with the subjects of the photos
modulated the likelihood of sharing photos in the expected
direction. Very negative photos were much less likely to be
shared than very positive photos, and the difference between
baseline and PP groups remained signiﬁcant across three of
the four valence levels. By contrast, the mean responses of
the PT group were more variable such that they were very
similar to the baseline group for the very negative photos
and very similar to the PP group for very positive photos.
Recall from the Introduction that adopting a self-perspective
can make one more self-aware and concerned about
the
opinions of others [18]. It also facilitates perspective taking
through which participants are more likely to put themselves
in another’s place. As such, these participants may be more
inclined to lessen sharing of negative photos and increase
sharing of positive photos in service of pro-social responding.
Alternatively, this response could be viewed as a form of
reputation management which is related to trusting ones’
partners [71]. Knowledge of others’ reputation permits the
choice of better partners and provides incentives to be more
cooperative. Individuals who have gained a reputation for
cooperative behavior are more likely to be chosen as partners
and to receive rewards. The type of responses displayed by
self-perspective participants are consistent with reciprocal and
cooperative behaviors and are thus likely to improve their
reputation.

Second,
the effects of photo valence on photo sharing
were modulated by participants’ self-reported history of photo
sharing. As we reported, the likelihood of sharing photos was
signiﬁcantly greater for those participants who had established
a high-frequency habit of photo sharing [36], [37] through
their everyday interactions with social media. The ﬁnding
that there was a signiﬁcant relationship between self-reported
photo-sharing frequency and photo sharing responses is con-
sistent with the evidence that established habits predict future
performance in similar situations. Although photo sharing
frequency was modestly correlated with age,
the obtained
pattern of results was maintained even after age was covaried
from the analyses. We are thus conﬁdent in concluding that
the previous history of photo sharing and not age, per se,
modulated participants’ likelihood of sharing photos in our
study. One possible reason that high-frequency photo sharers
responded with less concern for the privacy of others is that
they were more likely to respond automatically or at least
with less reﬂection regarding their decisions than those who
were less experienced with sharing photos. The logic here is
somewhat akin to the difference between experts and novices.
Those who are experts have a great deal of experience and are
often capable of bypassing working memory and responding
reﬂexively or automatically [72]. As such, they are less likely
to think about their choices before making a decision and
responding. If high-frequency photo sharers were forced to
slow down their decisions during our study, it is conceivable
that they would decrease their likelihood of sharing photos.
Lastly, male participants were more likely to share very
negative and negative photos than were female participants.
If greater sharing is considered consistent with less concern
about privacy or higher levels of risk taking, then our results
follow empirical evidence on gender differences in decision
making [33], [34]. Similarly, these ﬁndings are consistent with
empathy or communal concern differences between men and
women shown in previous research. Women tend to care more
than do men about others’ inner states and experiences (i.e.,
empathy) [35], which could explain our ﬁnding that women
are less willing to share negative photos of others.
C. Future directions
The lessons of our ﬁndings can serve as guidelines in
designing psychological interventions in the speciﬁc context of
photo-sharing online as well as the broader context of online
privacy. First, it is important to consider other background
variables that might inﬂuence a speciﬁc behavior, and how
the intervention to be used might interact with those variables.
More speciﬁcally, instead of providing a sense of control over
sharing decisions, an intervention might try to portray the
loss of actual control over information after sharing it. An
example might be informing the user that the service providers
own the shared content, they can reuse it for other purposes,
and the action cannot be undone and might result in a large
cascade of re-shares. If there is a possibility of an undesired
reaction as a result of a seemingly unnecessary intervention,
or habituated ignoring of frequent (and same) interventions,
a better approach might be to craft interventions based on
the severity of the consequence, such as using different colors
and fonts to cue the levels of danger. In the speciﬁc context
of photo sharing, ‘face in-painting’ [55] seems promising
since we found that negative photos were much less shared
when participants imagined themselves in the photos. Another
approach would be to explore interventions that inﬂuence the
way in which photos are shared. Prior work has shown that
it is possible to apply privacy-enhancing redactions that are
visually appealing as well [54], [56], [57]. Inducing people
to apply such redactions may be effective for people who are
prone to share the images anyway (as we observed with high
photo sharers), since these images can be shared ‘safely’. Fi-
nally, our ﬁndings reinforce the idea that interventions should
take account of the individual differences of the recipient [73],
[74], and interventions should be customized based on the
sharing history and demographics of the users.
VI. LIMITATIONS
There were some limitations to these studies that should
be mentioned. First, the data were collected using Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk, and this platform introduces some noise into
the data [75], [76]. To reduce noise, we included two attention
check questions and removed participants’ responses with one
or more wrong answers to maintain data quality. Similarly,
recruiting participants from this platform involves a limited
test population as well. Although participants reported robust
variability in individual differences such as age and photo-
sharing frequency, it will be important for future research
to replicate the present ﬁndings across additional participant
populations. Finally, an oversight in our recruiting method led
to a small amount of overlap in participants between Studies
1 and 2 (23 of 778 completed both studies). This overlap,

however, was quite small and reanalyzing the data without
these participants did not change our results.
Second, it is difﬁcult to know for certain how much the
task demands of the study inﬂuenced the results. Our task
could only approximate the online activity of participants.
Photos were neither self-selected nor sent to participants by
known friends. Moreover, it is artiﬁcial to make decisions
about sharing 98 photos in succession. In spite of these cir-
cumstances, there was a signiﬁcant concordance between self-
reported photo-sharing behaviors and photo-sharing responses
in the study. Furthermore, the behavioral manipulations did
make a difference with regard to participants’ performance. If
their responses were simply a function of the task demands,
then there was no reason to expect response differences as a
function of condition.
Third, we did not have independent measures to validate
that our two behavioral interventions increased the likelihood
of adopting either a self-perspective or a privacy-perspective.
It
is possible that our manipulations were responsible for
creating some network of activation that was not centered on
either a self- or privacy-perspective, per se, but nevertheless
was responsible for increasing the likelihood of photo-sharing
responses. For our purposes, the ﬁnding that the behavioral
interventions differentially changed photo-sharing responses
was most important, and conﬁrms that the responses were not
simply an artifact of some other unspeciﬁed process.
Finally, the present research focused exclusively on meme-
like photos. Whereas these photos are consistently shared
using traditional social media platforms such as Facebook,
it is unclear whether the present results would generalize to
more ephemeral photo-sharing platforms such as Snapchat.
The more ephemeral nature of these media may encourage
additional risk-taking (i.e., sharing very personal or embar-
rassing photos), which may make the paradoxical effects of
our interventions even more potent in such contexts. However,
more research is certainly needed to understand how the
ephemeral nature of such social media may interact with
behavioral interventions to inﬂuence photo-sharing decisions.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In sum, we set out to test two behavioral interventions for
reducing photo sharing and improving concerns about privacy.
Contrary to our predictions, adopting a self-perspective or a
privacy-perspective increased, as opposed to decreased, the
likelihood of participants sharing photos. This paradoxical
result does not appear to be a function of the task demands
of the study nor does it appear to be speciﬁc to only one type
of behavioral intervention. Instead, it appears to represent a
robust phenomenon that is in need of further research and a
more complete explanation. Not surprisingly, photo sharing
was also modulated by other factors including the emotional
valence of the photos as well as the participants’ history of
photo sharing. Furthermore, individual differences, such as
gender, concerns for personal privacy, and previous experience
posting embarrassing photos of someone else online or having
regrets about posting these photos online were associated with
participants’ likelihood of photo sharing. The goal of develop-
ing new interventions for reducing photo sharing, especially of
embarrassing or unﬂattering photos, is clearly a multivariate
problem that will require a great deal more research.
