### Managing NetBoot Service

This chapter provides guidance on the day-to-day tasks required to maintain efficient and reliable NetBoot service, including load balancing across multiple volumes or servers.

#### Controlling and Monitoring NetBoot

The following sections detail how to stop NetBoot service, disable individual images, and monitor or restrict client access.

##### Turning Off NetBoot Service

To prevent clients from using NetBoot on the server, you can disable the service on all Ethernet ports. Here’s how:

1. **Open Server Admin** and select **NetBoot** in the Computers & Services list.
2. Click **Stop Service**.

To stop service on a specific Ethernet port:
1. Click **Settings**, then **General**.
2. Deselect the **Enable** checkbox for the port.

To stop serving a particular image:
1. Click **Settings**, then **Images**.
2. Deselect the **Enable** checkbox for the image.

To stop service to a particular client:
1. Click **Settings**, then **Filters**.
2. Select **Enable NetBoot Filtering**.
3. Choose **Deny only clients listed below**.
4. Add the client’s hardware address to the list.

**From the Command Line:**
You can also use the `serveradmin` command in Terminal to stop NetBoot service or disable images. For more information, refer to the system image chapter of the command-line administration guide.

##### Disabling Individual Boot or Install Images

Disabling an image prevents client computers from starting up using that image.

1. **Open Server Admin** and select **NetBoot** in the Computers & Services list.
2. Click **Settings**, then **Images**.
3. Deselect the checkbox in the **Enable** column for the image.
4. Click **Save**.

**From the Command Line:**
You can also disable images using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the system image chapter of the command-line administration guide.

##### Viewing a List of NetBoot Clients

Server Admin allows you to view a list of clients that have booted from the server. This is a cumulative list, showing all clients that have connected, along with their last boot time.

1. **Open Server Admin** and select **NetBoot** in the Computers & Services list.
2. Click **Clients**.

##### Checking the Status of NetBoot and Related Services

You can use Server Admin to check the status of NetBoot service and the supporting services (such as NFS and TFTP).

1. **Open Server Admin** and select **NetBoot** in the Computers & Services list.
2. To see a summary of service status, click **Overview**.
3. To view the log file, click **Logs**.

**From the Command Line:**
You can check the status of NetBoot and its supporting services using commands in Terminal. See the system image chapter of the command-line administration guide.

##### Viewing the NetBoot Service Log

Server Admin allows you to view a log containing diagnostic information.

1. **Open Server Admin** and select **NetBoot** in the Computers & Services list.
2. Click **Logs**.

**From the Command Line:**
You can view the log by examining the contents of the log file in Terminal. For more information, see the system image chapter of the command-line administration guide.

#### Performance and Load Balancing

For optimal startup performance, it is crucial that the NetBoot server be available to the client computer. Here are some strategies to ensure responsive and reliable NetBoot service:

##### Staggering Boot Times

Many sites achieve acceptable responsiveness by staggering the boot times of client computers to reduce network load. Generally, it is not necessary to boot all client computers simultaneously. Instead, they can be booted early in the morning and remain booted throughout the workday. You can program staggered startup times using the Energy Saver preferences pane (Mac OS X version 10.3 or later) or control panel (Mac OS 9).

##### Adding Additional NetBoot Servers

If heavy usage and simultaneous client startups are overloading a NetBoot server, consider adding additional NetBoot servers to distribute the load. When incorporating multiple NetBoot servers, use switches in your network infrastructure to avoid the shared nature of hubs, which can create a single shared network where additional servers would compete for time.

##### Distributing Boot Images Across Servers

If you set up more than one NetBoot server on your network, you can place copies of a particular boot image on multiple servers to distribute the load. By assigning the copies the same image ID in the range 4096–65535, you can advertise them to your clients as a single image.

1. **Open Network Image Utility** on the server where the original image is stored.
2. Click **Images** (near the top of the window) and select the image in the list.
3. If the image’s Index is 4095 or lower, click **Edit** and give the image an index in the range 4096–65535.
4. Use the **Export** button to place copies of the image on the other servers.
5. On each of the other servers, use **Server Admin** to enable the image.

Clients will still see the image listed only once in their Startup Disk preferences, but the server that delivers its copy of the image will be automatically selected based on the current load.

##### Distributing Boot Images Across Server Disk Drives

Even with a single NetBoot server, you might improve performance by distributing copies of an image across multiple disk drives on the server. By assigning the copies the same image ID in the range 4096–65535, you can advertise them to your clients as a single image.

**Note:** Do not distribute images across different partitions of the same physical disk drive, as this can reduce performance.

1. **Open Server Admin** and select **NetBoot** in the Computers & Services list.
2. Click **Settings**, then **General**.
3. Click in the **Images** column for each volume you want to use for storing images. Choose volumes on different physical disk drives.
4. Click **Save**, then click **Images**.
5. If the image’s ID in the **Index** column is 4095 or lower, double-click the ID, type an index in the range 4096–65535, and save the change.
6. Open **Terminal**, switch to the root user, and use the `cp` command to copy the image to the NetBootSPn share points on the other volumes. For example:

```sh
sudo cp -R /Library/NetBoot/NetBootSP0/ImageName /Library/NetBoot/NetBootSP1/
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your NetBoot service remains efficient and reliable, even under high demand.
