  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I'm not able to see `console.log('some message')` when applied to a pages
getInitialProps.
Taking a fresh copy of next and creating an index page like so:
    import React, { Component} from 'react'
    export default class Index extends Component {
      async getInitialProps() {
        console.log('show your self')
      }
      render() {
        return (
          Index Page
        )
      }
    }
Running the server (in dev mode) and hitting the index page shows no message
in terminal.
## Current Behavior
No log's at all
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Create a new version of next.js project
  2. Apply the above code to pages/index.js file
  3. Run dev server
  4. Check for logs after visiting localhost:3000
