with genomic data, we can ﬁnd ways to mitigate them to move forward [Altman
et al., 2013]. Some solutions are eﬃcient enough for practical use, while others
will need further development to become practical.
In particular, practical
solutions often exploit the special nature of the genomic data to ﬁnd ways to be
eﬃcient under relevant domain assumptions.
VII.A Healthcare
Personalized medicine promises to revolutionize
Personalized medicine.
healthcare through treatments tailored to an individual’s genomic makeup and
genome-based disease risk tests that can enable early diagnosis of serious dis-
eases. Various players have diﬀerent concerns here. Patients, for instance, are
concerned about the privacy of their genomes. By contrast, healthcare orga-
nizations are concerned about their reputation and the trust of their clients.
And for-proﬁt companies, such as pharmaceutical manufacturers, are concerned
about the secrecy of their disease markers (proprietary information of business
importance).
A disease risk test can be expressed as a regular expression query tak-
ing into account sequencing errors and other properties of sequenced genomic
data. Oblivious automata enable regular expression queries to be computed over
genome sequence data while preserving the privacy of both the queries and the
genomic data [Troncoso-Pastoriza et al., 2007; Frikken, 2009]. Cryptographic
schemes have been developed to delegate the intensive computation in such a
scheme to a public cloud in a privacy-preserving fashion [Blanton et al., 2012].
Alternatively, it has been shown that a cryptographic primitive called Au-
thorized Private Set Intersection (A-PSI) can be used in this setting [Baldi et al.,
2011; Cristofaro et al., 2012]. In personalized medicine protocols based on A-
PSI, the healthcare organization provides cryptographically-authorized disease
markers, while the patient supplies her genome. In this setting, a regulatory
authority, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), can also cer-
tify the disease markers before they can be used in a clinical setting. Despite
its potential, this protocol has certain limitations. First, it is not very eﬃcient
in terms of its communication and computation costs. Second, the model as-
sumes that patients store their own genomes, which is not necessarily the case
in practice.
To address the latter issue, it has been suggested that the storage of the
homomorphically encrypted variants (e.g., SNPs) can be delegated to a semi-
honest third party [Ayday et al., 2013c]. A healthcare organization can then
request the third party to compute a disease susceptibility test (weighted aver-
age of the risk associated with each variant) on the encrypted variants using an
interactive protocol involving (i) the patient, (ii) the healthcare organization
and (iii) the third party. Homomorphic encryption based methods can also be
used to conduct privacy-preserving computation of disease risk based on both
genomic and non-genomic data (e.g., environmental and/or clinical data) [Ayday
et al., 2013d]. One of the problems with such protocols, however, is that storage
19
of homomorphically encrypted variants require orders of magnitude more mem-
ory than plaintext variants. However, a trade-oﬀ between the storage cost and
level of privacy can be composed [Ayday et al., 2013b]. A second problem is that
when an adversary has knowledge of the LD between the genome regions and
the nature of the test, the privacy of the patients will decrease when tests are
conducted on their homomorphically encrypted variants. This loss of privacy
can be quantiﬁed using an entropy-based metric [Ayday et al., 2013e].
Raw aligned genomic data. Raw aligned genomic data, that is, the aligned
outputs of a DNA sequencer, are often used by geneticists in the research pro-
cess. Due to the limitations of current sequencing technology, it is often the case
that only a small number of nucleotides are read (from the sequencer) at a time.
A very large number of these “short reads”10, covering the entire genome are
obtained, and are subsequently aligned, using a reference genome. The position
of the read relative to the reference genome is determined by ﬁnding the ap-
proximate match on the reference genome. With today’s sequencing techniques,
the size of such data can be up to 300GB per individual (in the clear), which
makes public key cryptography impractical for the management of such data.
Symmetric stream cipher and order-preserving encryption [Agrawal et al., 2004]
provide more eﬃcient solutions for storing, retrieving, and processing this large
amount of data in a privacy-preserving way [Ayday et al., 2014].
Genetic compatibility testing. Genetic compatibility testing is of interest
in both healthcare and DTC settings. It enables a pair of individuals to evaluate
the risk of conceiving an unhealthy baby. In this setting, PSI can be used to
compute genetic compatibility, where one party submits the ﬁngerprint for his
or her genome-based diseases, while the other party submits her or his entire
genome. In doing so, the couple learns their genetic compatibility without re-
vealing their entire genomes [Baldi et al., 2011]. Unfortunately this protocol can
leak information about an individual’s disease risk status to the other party and
its requirements for computation and communication may make it impractical.
Pseudo-anyonymization. Pseudo-anonymization is often performed by the
healthcare organization that collects the specimen (possibly by pathologists) to
remove patient identiﬁers before sending the specimen to a sequencing labora-
tory. In lieu of such information, a pseudonym can be derived from the genome
itself and public randomness, independently at the healthcare organization and
sequence laboratory for symmetric encryption [Cassa et al., 2013]. This process
can mitigate sample mismatch at the sequencing lab. However, since the key is
derived from the data that is encrypted using the same key, symmetric encryp-
tion should guarantee circular security (security notion required when cipher is
used to encrypt its own key), an issue which is not addressed in the published
protocol.
10A short read corresponds to a sequence of nucleotides on DNA. The raw genomic data of
an individual consists of hundreds of millions of short reads, each including around 100
nucleotides.

VII.B Research
Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS). Genome-Wide Association
Studies, 11 are conducted by analyzing the statistical correlation between the
variants of a certain genomic region in a case group (i.e., phenotype positive)
and control group (i.e., phenotype negative). GWAS is one of the most common
types of studies performed to learn genome-phenome associations. In GWAS
the aggregate statistics (e.g., p-values) are published in scientiﬁc articles and
are made available to other researchers. As mentioned earlier, such statistics
can pose privacy threats as explained in Section VI.
Recently,
it has been suggested that such information can be protected
through the application of noise to the data. In particular, diﬀerential privacy,
a well-known technique for answering statistical queries in a privacy preserv-
ing manner [Dwork, 2006], was recently adapted to compose privacy preserv-
ing query mechanisms for GWAS settings [Fienberg et al., 2011; Johnson and
Shmatikov, 2013]. In [Fienberg et al., 2011] the authors propose methods for
releasing diﬀerentially private minor allele frequencies (MAFs), chi-square statis-
tics, p-values, the top-k most relevant SNPs to a speciﬁc phenotype, and speciﬁc
correlations between particular pairs of SNPs. These methods are notable be-
cause traditional diﬀerential privacy techniques are unsuitable for GWAS due to
the fact that the number of correlations studied in GWAS are much larger than
the number of people in the study. However, diﬀerential privacy is typically
based on a mechanism that invokes Laplacian noise, and thus requires a very
large number of research participants to guarantee acceptable levels of privacy
and utility. In [Johnson and Shmatikov, 2013] , Johnson et. al. [Johnson and
Shmatikov, 2013] explain that computing the number of relevant SNPs and the
pairs of correlated SNPs are the goal of a typical GWAS and are not known
in advance. They provide an elegant distance-score mechanism to add noise to
the output. All relevant queries required by a typical GWAS are supported in-
cluding the number of SNPs associated with a disease and locations of the most
signiﬁcant SNPs. Empirical analysis suggests that the new distance score-based
diﬀerentially private queries produce acceptable privacy and utility for a typical
GWAS.
A meta-analysis of summary statistics from multiple independent cohorts
is required to ﬁnd associations in a GWAS. Diﬀerent teams of researchers of-
ten conduct studies on diﬀerent cohorts and are limited in their ability to share
individual-level data due to Institutional Review Board (IRB) restrictions. How-
ever, it is possible for the same participant to be in multiple studies, which can
aﬀect the results of a meta-analysis. It has been suggested that one-way crypto-
graphic hashing can be used to identify overlapping participants without sharing
individual-level data [Turchin and Hirschhorn, 2012].
Sequence comparison. Sequence comparison is widely used in bioinformatics
(e.g., in gene ﬁnding, motif ﬁnding, and sequence alignment). Such compari-
son is computationally complex.
It has been shown that fully homomorphic
11http://www.genome.gov/20019523
21
encryption (FHE), secure multiparty computation (SMC) and other traditional
cryptographic tools [Atallah et al., 2003; Jha et al., 2008] can be applied for
comparison purposes, but they do not scale to a full human genome. Alter-
natively, more scalable provably secure protocols exploiting public clouds have
been proposed [Blanton et al., 2012; Atallah and Li, 2005]. Computation on
the public data can be outsourced to a third party environment (e.g., cloud
provider) while computation on sensitive private sections can be performed lo-
cally; thus, outsourcing most of the computationally intensive work to the third
party. This computation partitioning can be achieved using program specializa-
tion which enables concrete execution on public data and symbolic execution
on the sensitive data [Wang et al., 2009b]. This protocol takes advantage of the
fact that genomic computations can be partitioned into computation on public
data and private data, exploiting the fact that 99.5% of the genomes of any two
individuals are similar.
Moreover, genome sequences can be transformed into sets of oﬀsets of dif-
ferent nucleotides in the sequence to eﬃciently compute similarity scores (e.g.,
Smith-Waterman computations) on outsourced distributed platforms (e.g., vol-
unteer systems). Similar sequences have similar oﬀsets, which provides suﬃcient
accuracy, and many-to-one transformations provide privacy [Szajda et al., 2006].
Although this approach does not provide provable security, it does not leak sig-
niﬁcant useful information about the original sequences.
Until this point, all sequence comparison methods we have discussed work on
complete genomic sequences. Compressed DNA data (i.e., the variants) can be
compared using novel data structure called Privacy-Enhanced Invertible Bloom
Filter [Eppstein et al., 2011]. This method provides communication-eﬃcient
comparison schemes.
Person-level genome sequence records. Person-level genome sequence
records contrast with the previous methods, which obscure sequences and report
on aggregated data rather than that of a single person. Several techniques have
been proposed for enabling privacy for personal-level genome sequences. For
instance, SNPs from several genomic regions can be generalized into more gen-
eral concepts – e.g.; transition (change of A↔G or T↔C.), transversion (change
of A↔C, A↔T, C↔G or G↔T.), and exact SNP positions into approximate
positions) [Lin et al., 2002]. This generalization makes re-identiﬁcation of an
individual sequence diﬃcult according to a prescribed level of protection.
In
particular, k-anonymity can be used to generalize the genomic sequences such
that a sequence is indistinguishable from at least other k − 1 sequences. Also,
the problem of SNP anonymization can be expanded to more complex variations
of a genome using multiple sequence alignment and clustering methods [Malin,
2005b; Li et al., 2012]. However, such methods are limited in that they only
work when there are a large number of sequences with relatively small number
of variations.
Given the limitations of generalization-based strategies, it has been sug-
gested that cryptographic techniques might be more appropriate for maintain-
ing data utility. In particular, it has been shown that additive homomorphic
22
encryption can be used to share encrypted data while still retaining the ability
to compute a limited set of queries (e.g., secure frequency count queries which
are useful to many analytic methods for genomic data) [Kantarcioglu et al.,
2008]. Yet, this method leaks information in that it reveals the positions of
the SNPs, which in turn reveals the type of test being conducted on the data.
Moreover, privacy in this protocol comes at a high cost of computation.
Cryptographic hardware at the remote site can be used as a trusted compu-
tation base (TCB) to design a framework in which all person-level biomedical
data is stored at a central remote server in encrypted form [Canim et al., 2012].
The server can compute over the genomic data from a large number of peo-
ple in a privacy-preserving fashion. This enables researchers to compute on
shared data without sharing person-level genomic data. This approach is eﬃ-
cient for typical biomedical computations. This approach is limited though in
that trusted hardware tends to have relatively small memory capacities, which
dictate the need for load balancing mechanisms.
Sequence alignment. Sequence alignment is fundamental to genome sequenc-
ing. The increase in the quantity of sequencing data is growing at a faster rate
than the decreasing cost of computational power, thus the delegation of read
mapping to the cloud can be very beneﬁcial. However, such delegation can
have major privacy implications. Chen et. al. [Chen et al., 2012] have shown
that read mapping can be delegated to the public cloud in a privacy preserv-
ing manner using a hybrid cloud-based approach. They exploit the fact that
a sequence of small number of nucleotides (≈20) is unique and two sequences
of equal length with edit distance of x, when divided into x + 1 segments will
have at least one matching segment. Based on this fact, computation is divided
into two parts: (i) the public part is delegated to the public cloud, in which the
public cloud ﬁnds exact matches on encrypted data and returns small number
of matches to the private cloud, whereas (ii) the private part takes place in a
private cloud, which computes the edit distance using only the matches returned
by the public cloud. This approach reduces the local computation by a factor
of 30 by delegating 98% of the work to the public cloud.
VII.C Legal and Forensic
Paternity testing. Paternity testing determines whether a certain male in-
dividual is the father of another individual. It is based on the high similarity
between the genomes of a father and child (99.9%) in comparison to two unre-
lated human beings (99.5%). It is not known exactly which 0.5% of the human
genome is diﬀerent between two humans, but a properly chosen 1% sample of
the genome can determine paternity with high accuracy [Gibbs and Singleton,
2006]. Participants may want to compute the test without sharing any infor-
mation about their genomes.
Once genomes of both individuals are sequenced, a privacy-preserving pa-
ternity test can be carried out using PSI-Cardinality (PSI-CA), where inputs
to PSI-CA protocol are the sets of nucleotides comprising the genome. The size
