mitigation methods decrease the prediction accuracy compared to
the no-defense baseline.
In Fig. 17(b), we compare ECDFs using E𝑖(𝑙1) (recall Section 5.3.1).
The lower score implies better marginal fitness. The experimental
result shows that the improved defense outperforms the naive
defense, and is on par with the no-defense baseline. The improved
defense succeeds in compensating the statistical deviation caused
by the naive defense (see Fig. 16(c)). More ECDFs of the naive
defense and the improved defense are shown in Figs. 19, 20, and 21.
In summary, both naive and improved defenses protect against
TableGAN-MCA and in part preserve learning ability of released
synthetic data. Moreover, the improved defense achieves better
marginal fitness than the naive defense. Despite the potentially
effective mitigation, TableGAN-MCA still remains a threat since
the proposed defenses achieve sub-optimal privacy-utility trade-
offs, e.g., reduced synthetic data diversity, under-performance for
tiny-domain datasets (see Compas datasets for details).
8 RELATED WORK
Membership privacy is the existence of individuals [25, 36]. Existing
studies show membership disclosure on discriminative machine
learning models, e.g., classifiers [28, 33, 41–43, 47] and genera-
tive machine learning models, e.g., Generative Adversarial Net-
works [7, 20, 21, 35]. In the discriminative settings, an adversary
infers whether a specific data point is used to train a target model
by querying classifier APIs and using predicted probability vec-
tors, labels, logits, etc., to train attack models. For instance, Shokri’s
shadow model [43] infers membership against overfitted multi-class
classifiers by training an attack model with labeled synthetic data,
which mimic the private training data. Subsequent works further
relax the adversary’s background knowledge [42] by extending
attacks to the white-box [33] and the label-only settings [9, 26].
In the track of inferring membership against the generative
models, there are several successful approaches, such as, table-
GAN [35], LOGAN [20], MC [21] and GAN-leaks [7]. Note that
some of these approaches is originally proposed against image data,
however, they are possibly extendable to attack tabular data. That is,
they are all related to this study. Hence, we briefly summarize these
methods in this section. The conceptual comparisons are shown in
Table 1. LOGAN [20] and table-GAN [35] leverage the output of the
overfitting discriminator to train an attack model, which is a variant
of Shokri et al. [43] in the context of GAN synthesis. However,
their attacks require the predicted probability vector of the target

A DP-WGAN
We list the DP-related hyper-parameters in differentially private
WGAN in Table 8. As a result, we show the ECDFs of marginals for
(𝜖, 𝛿)-DP synthesized data in Fig. 18. Smaller training dataset size
usually gains less satisfactory generation quality under DP training
with a similar privacy budget.
B NAIVE AND IMPROVED DEFENSES
We show additional ECDFs of marginals for “Remove Colliding
Members” mitigation and “GAN-constrained Training” mitigation
in Figs. 19, 20, and 21.
