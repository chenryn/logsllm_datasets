 SQL Injection
 An attack technique used to exploit web sites that construct SQL 
statement from user input
 Normally it is used to read, modify and delete database data
 In some cases, it is able to perform remote code execution
3
 What is a stacked query ?
 Condition where multiple SQL statements are allowed. SQL statements 
are separated by semicolon
 Stack query commonly used to write a file onto the machine while 
conducting SQL Injection attack
 Blackhat Amsterdam 2009, Bernando Damele demonstrated remote code 
execution performed through SQL injection on platforms with stacked 
query
 Today I will demonstrate how to conduct remote code execution through 
SQL injection without stacked query
 MySQL-PHP are widely use but stacked query is not allowed by default to 
security reason
4
 Abusing stacked queries on MySQL
query.aspx?id=21; create table temp(a blob); insert into temp 
values (‘0x789c……414141’)--
query.aspx?id=21; update temp set a = replace (a, ‘414141’, 
query.aspx?id=21; update temp set a = replace (a, ‘414141’, 
9775…..71’)--
query.aspx?id=21; select a from temp into dumpfile
‘/var/lib/mysql/lib/udf.so’--
query.aspx?id=21; create function sys_exec RETURNS int
SONAME 'udf.so‘--

 Remote code execution on MySQL-PHP
 Traditionally, simple PHP shell is used to execute command
 Command is executed as a web server user only
 Weak and has no strong functionality 
 We need a reliable shell!
 Metasploit contains variety of shellcodes
 Meterpreter shellcode for post exploitation process
 VNC shellcode for GUI access on the host

 File read/write access on MySQL-PHP platform
 SELECT .. LOAD_INFILE is used to read file
 SELECT .. INTO OUTFILE/DUMPFILE is used to write file
 Remote code execution technique on MySQL-PHP 
platform
platform
 Upload the compressed arbitrary file onto the web server 
directory
 Upload the PHP scripts onto the web server directory
 Execute the PHP Gzuncompress function to decompress the 
arbitrary file
 Execute the arbitrary file through the PHP System function
8
 Challenge on writing arbitrary through UNION SELECT
 GET request is limited to 8190 bytes on Apache
 May be smaller when Web Application firewall in use
 Data from the first query query can overwrite the file header
 Data from extra columns can add extra unnecesary data into our 
 Data from extra columns can add extra unnecesary data into our 
arbitrary data. This can potentially corrupt our file
9
 Fixing the URL length issue
 PHP Zlib module can be used to compress the arbitrary file
 9625 bytes of executable can be compressed to  630 bytes 
which is able to bypass the max limit request 
 Decompress the file on the destination before the arbitrary file is 
executed
executed
10
 Removal of unnecessary data 
 UNION SELECT will combine the result from the first query with 
the second query
query.php?id=21 UNION SELECT 0x34….3234,null,null--
 Result from the first query can overwrite the file header
 Non existing data can be injected in the WHERE clause
11
First Query
Second Query
Result from first query data + executable code
12
First Query
Executable code
 Fixing the columns issue
 In UNION SELECT, the second query required the same amount 
of columns as the first query
 Compressed arbitrary data should be injected in the first column 
to prevent data corruption
 Zlib uses Adler32 checksum and this value is added at the end of 
 Zlib uses Adler32 checksum and this value is added at the end of 
our compressed arbitrary data
 Any injected data after the Adler32 checksum will be ignored 
during the decompression process
13
query.php?id=44444 UNION SELECT 0x0a0e13…4314324,0x00,0x00, 
into outfile ‘/var/www/upload/meterpreter.exe’
Random data after the Adler32 checksum

Adler32 Checksum
 Remote code execution on LAMP (Linux, Apache, 
MySQL, PHP)
 By default, any directory created in Linux is not writable by  
mysql /web server users
 When the mysql user has the ability to upload a file onto the 
web server directory, this directory can be used to upload our 
web server directory, this directory can be used to upload our 
arbitrary file
 By default, uploaded file on the web server through INTO 
DUMPFILE is not executable but readable. This file is owned by a 
mysql user
 Read the file content as a web server user and write it back onto 
the web server directory
 Chmod the file to be executable and execute using the PHP 
system function
15
 Remote code execution on WAMP (Windows, 
Apache, MySQL, PHP)
 By default, MySQL runs as a Local System user
 By default, this user has the ability to write into any directory 
including the web server directory
 Any new file created by this user is executable
 PHP system function can be used to execute this file

MySqloit
 MySqloit is a MySQL injection takeover tool
Features
 SQL Injection detection – Detect SQL injection through deep 
blind injection method
blind injection method
 Fingerprint Dir – Fingerprint the web server directory
 Fingerprint OS – Fingerprint the Operating System 
 Payload – Create a shellcode using Metasploit
 Exploit – Upload the shellcode and execute it
