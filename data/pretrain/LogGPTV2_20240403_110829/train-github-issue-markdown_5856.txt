    I don't know if there are relevant open bugs for this. I didn't see any on a quick
    glance.
    This issue is for tracking work toward being able to call Go from C programs (perhaps
    linked into the program already, perhaps as a dynload .so file).
    Elias Naur has done some good work getting the raw technical details of things like
    large-model, position-independent code working.
    The biggest step that remains is defining what it means to enter a Go program. Do we use
    the usual 'run main.init+main.main' that we use for standalone binaries? Do we use
    something else? Is os.Args defined? And so on.
    I expect this to happen after Go 1.1.
