4.3 Clustering Analysis
Since only 14.59% of suspected promotion accounts claim their
organizations, we clustered distinct groups of suspected promotion
accounts for further analysis. Note that our measurements are only
associated with 28,258 suspected promotion accounts detected in
2018, due to the strict rate limit of GitHub API interface. We first
grouped these 28,258 suspected promotion accounts into different
groups by the “following” relationship between them. Then we
calculated if these groups share any common suspected promotion
accounts. The clustering analysis of suspected promotion accounts
can provide complementary information about these accounts.
Although suspected promotion accounts may actively follow
others to make a profit, it is not easy for them to be followed by
normal accounts. After analyzing the communications with promo-
tion service providers being infiltrated, we learned that suspected
promotion accounts may follow one another to form a group. This
is because these service providers attempt to give others an impres-
sion that these accounts are reliable and reputable. By analyzing
the clustered groups of promotion accounts, we can have a deep
understanding of their topological structure.

that 973 of the sampled 1,000 suspected promotion accounts had
starred or forked more than three suspected repositories, indicating
the effectiveness of our approach.
3.8 Ethical Issues
To better understand how GitHub promotion service providers
work and gain profits, as well as to learn the providers’ strategies
from the inside, we purchased two GitHub promotion services at
the cost of about $295 in total. This may raise an ethical concern
that the GitHub promotion service providers were funded by us.
However, we argue that our influence is very limited compared to
the projected total profit of $3.41 million, as shown in Section 4.8.
Another concern is that our test accounts and repositories may have
brought negative impact on GitHub. To eliminate such a potential
negative impact, we deleted these two accounts and all related
repositories at the end of our study.
4 MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS
Using our SVM classifier trained in Section 3, we identified 63,872
suspected promotion accounts. In this section, we first investigate
the temporal dynamics and organization distributions of these sus-
pected promotion accounts. Second, we cluster them into groups
to study the topological structure in every group and the relation-
ship among different groups. Third, we check how many suspected
promotion accounts are officially banned by GitHub, observing
that only less than 5% of these accounts are detected and banned
by the existing defense mechanism in GitHub. Next, we compare
average star and fork counts between normal users and suspected
promotion accounts, as well as the profile information of both types.
Finally, we examine the lifespan of suspected promotion accounts
in GitHub, exploring when these accounts are registered and esti-
mating the revenue of this kind of promotion service.
4.1 Temporal Dynamics
The number of suspected promotion accounts against time ranging
from 2015 to 2019 is shown in Figure 5, which shows a rapid growth
trending. We can see that there were only 3,893 suspected promo-
tion accounts about five years ago. In 2016 and 2018, the number

Figure 6: Top 10 Groups of Suspected Promotion Accounts.
Every bar represents a group. The line between two groups
represents the amount of shared accounts. The thicker the
line, the more accounts they share.
In detail, we analyzed the “following” relationship among sus-
pected promotion accounts in four steps. (1) For each suspected
promotion account 𝑎, we crawled all its followers, and conducted
the logic “AND” operation with those followers that are also sus-
pected promotion accounts, and form 𝑎’s follower group, 𝐹𝑎, which
includes accounts that are both 𝑎’s followers and suspected promo-
tion accounts. (2) We labeled “𝑎” as a core element and merged “𝑎”
into its followers’ group 𝐹𝑎, resulting a group node 𝐴. It is possible
that some accounts can be grouped into more than one group, and
we call them “shared accounts.” (3) For any two groups 𝐹𝑥 and
𝐹𝑦, if one of them is a subset of others or their “shared accounts”
have more than 20% occupancy in their individual follower group
“𝐹𝑥/𝑦”, we merged them together. (4) Finally, we sorted the gen-
erated groups by counting group members, while the number of
“shared accounts” between any two groups determines the num-
ber of connections between these two group nodes.
Then, let 𝐺 = denote the undirected graph of suspected
promotion account groups. 𝑉 represents each group of suspected
promotion accounts, and 𝐸 denotes each connection among these
groups.
We show our result in Figure 6. From the figure, we can see
that these groups are almost fully connected to each other, nearly
forming a completely connected graph. Some suspected promotion
accounts belong to more than two groups. This implies that some
suspected promotion accounts join in multiple promotion groups
for making more profit. The largest group shown in the figure
contains 400 suspected promotion accounts.
4.4 Banned Accounts
GitHub must have various detection mechanisms for detecting
malicious activities. Once detected, GitHub would ban the related
accounts and respond with a 404 page when others visit their
homepages or repositories. But by receiving only the 404 page,
one cannot determine whether the corresponding account does
not exist at all or is banned. However, we can distinguish these
two scenarios by checking the log file, because the recently banned
accounts must have been recorded in the log file.
Figure 7: Average number of fork and star operations be-
tween normal and promotion accounts.
To check whether a suspected promotion account is banned
by GitHub, we visited each of these 28,258 suspected promotion
accounts’ homepage and observed that only 1,184 of them are ac-
tively banned by GitHub. In other words, only 4.19% are banned by
GitHub. This implies that only few of these suspected promotion
accounts trigger the detection mechanism of GitHub while most
of them can evade. Therefore, it is obvious that GitHub needs to
significantly improve its detection mechanisms for more effective
promotion detection, and our work is able to help GitHub to reach
this goal.
4.5 Fake Stars and Forks
Since the profit of GitHub promoters mainly comes from stars and
forks, they must perform numerous star and fork operations. Thus,
on average, a promotion account is likely to perform more star and
fork operations than a normal account. More importantly, since
promotion accounts need to finish the promotion target within a
short time period, their star and fork operation behaviors are more
bursty than those of normal accounts. Therefore, we investigated
the average operation number of stars and forks for suspected
promotion accounts and compared with that of normal accounts in
2018. For normal accounts, the average operation number of forks
is 4.50 and that of stars is 21.17, while for suspected promotion
accounts, the average operation number of forks is 8.92 and that of
stars is 91.54. Suspected promotion accounts have much more (1.98
times) fork operations and (4.32 times) star operations than normal
accounts. Note that the difference in stars between promotion and
normal accounts is clearly larger than that in forks. We believe
that this is because star is a more straightforward indicator during
recruitment, thus it is more widely used and becomes more popular
in promotion services. Our observation is also supported by [12]
and [23]. The result is shown in Figure 7.
4.6 Profile Comparison
To better distinguish promotion accounts from normal ones, we
further inspected and compared the profile information of suspected

accordance with our common sense that mature accounts are more
reputable.
However, these mature accounts are also likely not created by
promotion service providers. We speculate that promotion service
providers need to leverage different ways to convert these aged
accounts into promotion accounts. For example, some of these
mature accounts could be compromised. We found that there were
at least two security accidents that happened in 2016 and 2018
respectively [1, 5]. Moreover, some of these mature accounts are
paid or leased by promotion service providers to become promotion
accounts. This has been confirmed by our observation that there
are a number of merchants selling GitHub accounts in Darknet to
promotion service providers, as presented in Section 2.
4.8 Revenue Estimation
Since the profit of a GitHub promoter is related to the number
of star and fork operations being performed, we count the num-
ber of star and fork operations of suspected promotion accounts.
Note that there are a few uncertain factors in estimating the to-
tal revenue of this underground economy. The first factor is that
the existing number of star and fork operations in a repository is
not accurate, because suspected promotion accounts can star or
fork the repository for only a specific time period, then cancel this
operation. The second factor is that some promotion accounts per-
form star and fork operations not only on customers’ repositories,
but also on popular projects for disguising themselves. We assume
that the most authoritative developers and organizations do not
need promotion services. So, we first calculated all fork and star
operation counts of these suspected promotion accounts. Then we
crawled the popular repositories list in https://gitstar-ranking.com/,
obtaining 1,000 repositories. Therefore, we can estimate the lower
bound of the revenue of the promotion service. According to our
observations about price (i.e., $0.50 for each fork operation and
$0.40 for each star operation) in Section 2.2, the lower bound of the
revenue of all promotion service providers could have been up to
$3.41 million in 2018 and $4.37 million in 2019.
5 CASE STUDIES
Here we show case studies of the suspected promotion accounts and
the associated repositories that are potentially promoted by these
accounts. We first focus on forging retroactive commits, which help
suspected promotion accounts to disguise themselves as normal
accounts and can be abused by promotion service providers to
help customers pretend to be hard-working developers. Then, we
describe some small businesses that utilize GitHub promotion as
advertisements for selling their products.
5.1 Forging Retroactive Commits
GitHub provides a functionality that allows accounts to modify
a committed message in case the owner has submitted private
information, and permits accounts to add retroactive commits if he
uploads important files (e.g., database IP and password) or if there
is no Internet access during the development period.
However, we found that promotion service providers can abuse
this functionality and forge retroactive commits. As shown in Fig-
ure 11 in Appendix A, the left sub-figure is the original commit
Figure 8: User profile setting of promotion accounts.
promotion accounts with that of normal accounts. In GitHub, for
avatar, if an account has not set its personalized avatar, GitHub
would set a default one. This default avatar uses only two different
colors and its size is 420 x 420. We extracted the avatar URL of each
suspected promotion account by visiting a promotion account’s
homepage via web interface. We detected if an account’s avatar is
default by checking the avatar’s size and colors, using the python
library Pillow [8]. Finally, we found 6,130 (21.69%) of suspected
promotion accounts using default avatars and 22,036 (78.31%) of
them using personalized avatars.
It is impossible to crawl all normal accounts’ avatars, and so we
randomly sampled 100K accounts from the user list and inspected
them. Surprisingly, only 25,698 (25.70%) accounts had personalized
avatars while 74,302 (74.30%) used default avatars. This is surpris-
ing because normal accounts have a higher likelihood of using
default avatars than suspected promotion accounts. This also indi-
cates that suspected promotion accounts are more likely to utilize
personalized avatars to disguise as normal.
As for organization information in a profile, we found that 4,106
(14.58%) of suspected promotion accounts have no such informa-
tion while 24,060 (85.42%) of them do. For the personal homepage
link and company information, we found 9,913 (35.19%) and 7,916
(28.10%) of suspected promotion accounts have valid information,
respectively. This result shows that suspected promotion accounts
do not care much about profile information settings, but most of
them use personalized avatars to indicate that they are not bot
accounts. Figure 8 shows these results.
4.7 Registration Time
We examined the registration time of these 28,258 suspected pro-
motion accounts in 2018 to check when they were registered. We
cannot retrieve an account’s registration time precisely from its
web interface because there is no such information provided, so
we had to query GitHub APIs [17]. We queried all 28,258 suspected
promotion accounts through API and extracted their registration
time. From the result we find that the registration time ranges from
2008 to 2018, and most of them were registered between February
2013 and July 2016. This means that promotion service providers
prefer to use mature accounts rather than new ones, which is in
Understanding Promotion-as-a-Service on GitHub

history of our honeypot repository. It shows that it had only two
contributions in 2016. The right sub-figure is modified by forging
historical commits from promotion service providers, and it shows
that we had 190 contributions in 2016, which can deceive others
into thinking that we are productive developers.
To forge retroactive commits, one must first change historical
records stored separately in two local files named “pack-*.idx” and
“pack-*.pack.” Then, one must forge a temporary file and tamper
with its content, such as adding and deleting characters. By up-
loading these files back to GitHub via API, the promotion service
providers can change historical records at will. Figure 12 in Appen-
dix A shows the forging process.
We reported this abuse to GitHub, and they indicated that they
would pass our findings on to the corresponding team for serious
consideration. Note that though this feature has been discovered
before for creating pixel art on a personal homepage in GitHub [3],
we are the first to report how this can be abused for promotion.
5.2 Promotion by Small Businesses
In our research, we found that some small businesses, especially
IT companies, exploit GitHub to promote their businesses. In such
a situation, a company can publish the repository on GitHub and
place a link to their homepage on GitHub. By exploiting GitHub’s
web ranking, their links are also promoted, similar to “blackhat SEO”
illustrated in [30, 50]. Here we give an example of GitHub “blackhat
SEO” utilized, in which we inspect the strategy for this company
to promote their business via GitHub. As shown in Figure 9, the
company first publishes the repository on GitHub and places the
link in their source code, homepage hyperlink or “readme.md” to
their online shop’s homepage, showing a hyperlink from GitHub. In
most cases, the source code they published on GitHub is a free trial
version that provides only limited services, specifically, supporting
only few users with restricted functionalities.

5.3 Potentially Compromised Accounts
It has been reported that there are more than 2.1 million organiza-
tions in GitHub [11]. However, we found 4,122 (14.59% of 28,258
in 2018) suspected promotion accounts belong to at least one orga-
nization. We present an example in Figure 10, where one account
from IBM was identified as a suspected promotion account since it
forked our honeypot repository during the test period. Moreover,
we observed that this account forked more than 100 repositories
from December 30th, 2018 to January 20th, 2019. Therefore, we
speculate that this account has been compromised.
