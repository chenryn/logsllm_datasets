### 4.3 Clustering Analysis
Only 14.59% of suspected promotion accounts declare their organizational affiliations, which motivated us to cluster these accounts for further analysis. Our analysis is based on 28,258 suspected promotion accounts detected in 2018, constrained by the strict rate limits of the GitHub API. 

First, we grouped these accounts into distinct clusters based on their "following" relationships. We then determined if any common suspected promotion accounts were shared among these groups. This clustering analysis provides additional insights into the structure and behavior of these accounts.

Although suspected promotion accounts may actively follow others to generate profit, they are less likely to be followed by normal accounts. Our analysis of communications with compromised promotion service providers revealed that suspected promotion accounts often follow each other to form interconnected groups. This strategy is employed to create an impression of reliability and reputation. By examining these clustered groups, we can gain a deeper understanding of their topological structure.

**Figure 5: Time Distribution of Suspected Promotion Accounts**
Our analysis also showed that 973 out of 1,000 sampled suspected promotion accounts had starred or forked more than three suspected repositories, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

### 3.8 Ethical Issues
To better understand the operations and profit strategies of GitHub promotion service providers, we purchased two such services at a total cost of approximately $295. This raises ethical concerns about funding these providers. However, our financial contribution is minimal compared to the estimated total profit of $3.41 million, as detailed in Section 4.8.

Another concern is the potential negative impact of our test accounts and repositories on GitHub. To mitigate this, we deleted these accounts and all related repositories at the conclusion of our study.

### 4 MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS
Using the SVM classifier trained in Section 3, we identified 63,872 suspected promotion accounts. In this section, we investigate several aspects of these accounts:

1. **Temporal Dynamics and Organizational Distributions**: We analyze the temporal trends and organizational affiliations of these accounts.
2. **Clustering and Topological Structure**: We cluster the accounts to study the topological structure within and between groups.
3. **Banned Accounts**: We check how many of these accounts are officially banned by GitHub, finding that less than 5% are detected and banned by existing mechanisms.
4. **Comparison of Star and Fork Counts**: We compare the average star and fork counts between normal users and suspected promotion accounts.
5. **Lifespan and Revenue Estimation**: We examine the registration times and estimate the revenue generated by these promotion services.

### 4.1 Temporal Dynamics
Figure 5 shows the number of suspected promotion accounts from 2015 to 2019, indicating a rapid growth trend. In 2015, there were only 3,893 such accounts, but the numbers increased significantly in 2016 and 2018.

### 4.2 Detailed Clustering Process
We analyzed the "following" relationships among suspected promotion accounts in four steps:

1. **Follower Group Formation**: For each account \(a\), we crawled its followers and identified those who are also suspected promotion accounts, forming a follower group \(F_a\).
2. **Group Merging**: We labeled \(a\) as a core element and merged it into its follower group \(F_a\), creating a group node \(A\). Some accounts may belong to multiple groups, known as "shared accounts."
3. **Group Consolidation**: If one group is a subset of another or if the shared accounts exceed 20% of the individual follower groups, we merged these groups.
4. **Sorting and Visualization**: We sorted the groups by member count and visualized the connections based on the number of shared accounts.

**Figure 6: Top 10 Groups of Suspected Promotion Accounts**
This figure shows the interconnectedness of the groups, with some accounts belonging to more than two groups, suggesting they join multiple groups for greater profit. The largest group contains 400 suspected promotion accounts.

### 4.4 Banned Accounts
GitHub employs various detection mechanisms to identify and ban malicious accounts. We visited the homepages of 28,258 suspected promotion accounts and found that only 1,184 (4.19%) were actively banned. This indicates that most suspected promotion accounts evade detection, highlighting the need for improved detection mechanisms.

### 4.5 Fake Stars and Forks
Promotion accounts perform numerous star and fork operations to generate profit. On average, suspected promotion accounts performed 8.92 forks and 91.54 stars, compared to 4.50 forks and 21.17 stars for normal accounts. This significant difference, especially in star operations, suggests that stars are a more popular and straightforward indicator in promotion services.

**Figure 7: Average Number of Fork and Star Operations**

### 4.6 Profile Comparison
To distinguish promotion accounts from normal ones, we compared their profile information. Surprisingly, 78.31% of suspected promotion accounts used personalized avatars, while only 25.70% of randomly sampled normal accounts did. This indicates that promotion accounts use personalized avatars to appear legitimate.

### 4.7 Registration Time
We examined the registration times of 28,258 suspected promotion accounts, finding that most were registered between February 2013 and July 2016. This preference for mature accounts suggests that promotion service providers aim to use established accounts for greater credibility.

### 4.8 Revenue Estimation
We estimated the revenue of promotion services by counting the star and fork operations. Despite uncertainties, we calculated a lower bound of $3.41 million in 2018 and $4.37 million in 2019, based on observed prices of $0.50 per fork and $0.40 per star.

### 5 CASE STUDIES

#### 5.1 Forging Retroactive Commits
Promotion service providers can abuse GitHub's functionality to forge retroactive commits, making accounts appear more productive. We reported this to GitHub, and they indicated that they would consider our findings seriously.

**Figure 11: Original and Modified Commit History**

#### 5.2 Promotion by Small Businesses
Some small businesses, particularly IT companies, use GitHub to promote their products. They publish repositories and include links to their online shops, leveraging GitHub's web ranking for "blackhat SEO."

**Figure 9: Promotion Strategy of Small Businesses**

#### 5.3 Potentially Compromised Accounts
We found that 4,122 (14.59%) of suspected promotion accounts belonged to organizations. An example is an IBM account that forked our honeypot repository and over 100 other repositories in a short period, suggesting it was compromised.

### 6 DISCUSSION
We have reported our findings through GitHub's "Report abuse" page, and they have acknowledged our report.
