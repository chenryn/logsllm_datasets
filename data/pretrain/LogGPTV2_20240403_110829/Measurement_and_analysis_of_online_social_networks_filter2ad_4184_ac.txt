### 5.1 Link Symmetry

The directed nature of links in information networks, such as the Web graph, can be leveraged to locate and rank content. For example, algorithms like PageRank [43] interpret a directed link from a source to a destination as an endorsement of the destination by the source, but not vice versa. Prominent websites, such as cnn.com or nytimes.com, receive numerous incoming links from other pages, while they themselves link back to very few. Search engines use this asymmetry to identify reputable sources of information, as pages with high indegree are often considered authoritative [21].

In the social networks we studied, with the exception of Orkut, links are directed, allowing users to link to any other user they choose. The target of the link may reciprocate by creating a link back to the source. Our analysis of the symmetry in social networks, presented in Table 1, reveals that the three social networks with directed links (Flickr, LiveJournal, and YouTube) exhibit a significant degree of symmetry. This high level of symmetry is consistent with that observed in offline social networks [20]. Additionally, social networking sites notify users of new incoming links, which may contribute to the high level of symmetry.

Regardless of the underlying causes, the symmetric nature of social links influences the network structure. For instance, symmetry increases overall connectivity and reduces the network's diameter. However, it also complicates the identification of reputable sources of information, as these sources tend to dilute their importance by linking back to arbitrary users who link to them.

### 5.2 Power-Law Node Degrees

To examine the graph structure, we first consider the node degree distribution. As discussed in Section 3, many complex networks, including offline social networks, have been shown to follow power-law distributions. Therefore, it is not surprising that social networks also exhibit power-law degree distributions. However, our analysis reveals that the degree distributions in social networks differ from those of other power-law networks in several ways.

Figure 2 shows the outdegree and indegree complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDF) for each measured social network. All networks display behavior consistent with power-law networks, where most nodes have small degrees, and a few nodes have significantly higher degrees. To test how well the degree distributions fit a power-law model, we used the maximum likelihood method [13] to calculate the best power-law fit. Table 2 presents the estimated power-law coefficients along with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit metric [13]. While the power-law coefficients approximate the distributions well for Flickr, LiveJournal, and YouTube, the Orkut data deviates significantly.

Two factors contribute to this deviation. First, our Orkut crawl reached only 11.3% of the network, and partial breadth-first search (BFS) crawls tend to undersample nodes with lower degrees, leading to a flatter head in the distribution [29]. Second, both LiveJournal and Orkut impose artificial caps on the number of outgoing links a user can create, which distorts the distribution at high degrees. Specifically, Orkut caps the outdegree at 1,000, and LiveJournal at 750. These caps were implemented after the networks were established, so some users exceed them. Flickr has since instituted a cap of 3,000 non-reciprocal links, but the data analyzed here was collected before this cap was in place.

We also tested the stability of the power-law coefficient estimates by running the maximum likelihood estimator over varying subsample sizes of our data [53]. We found that the estimates were remarkably stable, varying by less than 6% from those in Table 2 even when considering as few as 1,000 data points.

Table 2 also highlights a difference between the structure of social networks and previously observed networks. In the Web, the indegree and outdegree power-law exponents differ significantly, whereas in our social networks, the power-law exponents for indegree and outdegree distributions are very similar. This implies that in online social networks, the distribution of outgoing links is similar to that of incoming links, whereas in the Web, incoming links are more concentrated on a few high-degree nodes than outgoing links.

Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of incoming and outgoing links across nodes in the Web and Flickr graphs. The difference is clear: 5% of Web nodes account for 75% of all incoming links but only 25% of all outgoing links. In all social networks we considered, the distributions of incoming and outgoing links across nodes are very similar.

### 5.3 Correlation of Indegree and Outdegree

Studies of the indegree and outdegree distributions in the Web graph have helped researchers find better ways to identify relevant information. In the Web, the population of active pages (those with high outdegree) is not the same as the population of popular pages (those with high indegree) [21]. For example, many individual user pages actively link to a few popular pages like wikipedia.org or cnn.com. Web search techniques effectively separate a small set of popular pages from a larger set of active pages.

In social networks, nodes with very high outdegree also tend to have very high indegree. In our study, for each network, the top 1% of nodes ranked by indegree overlaps more than 65% with the top 1% of nodes ranked by outdegree. The corresponding overlap in the Web is less than 20%. Hence, active users (those who create many links) in social networks also tend to be popular (they are the target of many links). Figure 4 shows the extent of the overlap between the top x% of nodes ranked by indegree and outdegree.

Figure 5 plots the cumulative distributions of the outdegree-to-indegree ratio for the four social networks and the Web. Social networks show a remarkable correspondence between indegree and outdegree; for all networks, over 50% of nodes have an indegree within 20% of their outdegree. The distribution for the Web is markedly different; most nodes have considerably higher outdegree than indegree, while a small fraction of nodes have significantly higher indegree than outdegree.

The high correlation between indegree and outdegree in social networks can be explained by the high number of symmetric links. The high symmetry may be due to the tendency of users to reciprocate links from other users who point to them. This process results in active users (who place many outgoing links) automatically receiving many incoming links, leading to the distributions we observed.

### 5.4 Path Lengths and Diameter

Next, we examine the properties of shortest paths between users. Table 3 shows the average path lengths, diameters, and radii for the four social networks. In absolute terms, the path lengths and diameters for all four social networks are remarkably short. Interestingly, despite being comparable in size to the Web graph we considered, the social networks have significantly shorter average path lengths and diameters. This property may result from the high degree of reciprocity within the social networks.

Incidentally, Broder et al. [12] noted that if the Web were treated as an undirected graph, the average path length would drop from 16.12 to 7.

### 5.5 Link Degree Correlations

To further explore the differences in network structure between online social networks and previously observed networks, we examine which users tend to connect to each other. Specifically, we focus on the joint degree distribution (JDD), which describes how often nodes of different degrees connect to each other. This property is also referred to as the 2K-distribution [33] or mixing patterns [42].

#### 5.5.1 Joint Degree Distribution

The JDD provides insights into the structural properties of networks. For example, networks where high-degree nodes tend to connect to other high-degree nodes are more likely to be subject to epidemics, as a single infected high-degree node will quickly infect other high-degree nodes. Conversely, networks where high-degree nodes tend to connect to low-degree nodes show the opposite behavior; a single infected high-degree node will not spread an epidemic very far.

The JDD is approximated by the degree correlation function \( k_{nn} \), which maps outdegree to the average indegree of all nodes connected to nodes of that outdegree. An increasing \( k_{nn} \) indicates a tendency of higher-degree nodes to connect to other high-degree nodes, while a decreasing \( k_{nn} \) represents the opposite trend. Figure 6 shows a plot of \( k_{nn} \) for the four networks we studied.

The trend for high-degree nodes to connect to other high-degree nodes can be observed in all networks except YouTube. The unexpected bump at the head of the Orkut curve is likely due to the undersampling of users. This suggests that high-degree nodes in social networks tend to connect to other high-degree nodes, forming a "core" of the network. Anecdotally, the different behavior seen in YouTube may be due to its more "celebrity"-driven nature, with a few extremely popular users to whom many unpopular users connect.
