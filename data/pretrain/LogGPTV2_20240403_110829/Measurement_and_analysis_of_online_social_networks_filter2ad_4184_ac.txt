5.1 Link symmetry
The fact that links are directed can be useful for locat-
ing content in information networks. For example, in the
Web graph, search algorithms such as PageRank [43] con-
sider a directed link from a source to a destination as an
endorsement of the destination by the source, but not vice-
versa. For instance, numerous Web pages point to sites like
cnn.com or nytimes.com, but very few pages receive pointers
back from these sites. Search engines leverage this to iden-
tify reputed sources of information, since pages with high
indegree tend to be authorities [21].
With the exception of Orkut, links in the social networks
we studied are directed and users may therefore link to any
other user they wish. The target of the link may reciprocate
by placing a link pointing back at the source. Our anal-
ysis of the level of symmetry in social networks, shown in
Table 1, reveals that all three social networks with directed
links (Flickr, LiveJournal, and YouTube) have a signiﬁcant
degree of symmetry. Their high level of symmetry is consis-
tent with that of oﬄine social networks [20]. Furthermore,
social networking sites inform users of new incoming links,
which may also contribute to the high level of symmetry.
Independent of the causes, the symmetric nature of social
links aﬀects the network structure. For example, symmetry
increases the overall connectivity of the network and reduces
its diameter. Symmetry can also make it harder to identify
reputable sources of information just by analyzing the net-
work structure, because reputed sources tend to dilute their
importance when pointing back to arbitrary users who link
to them.
5.2 Power-law node degrees
We begin to examine the graph structure by considering the
node degree distribution. As discussed in Section 3, the de-
gree distributions of many complex networks, including of-
ﬂine social networks, have been shown to conform to power-
laws. Thus, it may not be surprising that social networks
also exhibit power-law degree distributions. However, as our
analysis shows, the degree distributions in social networks
diﬀer from that of other power-law networks in several ways.
Figure 2 shows the outdegree and indegree complementary
cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for each measured
social network. All of the networks show behavior consistent
with a power-law network; the majority of the nodes have
small degree, and a few nodes have signiﬁcantly higher de-
gree. To test how well the degree distributions are modeled
by a power-law, we calculated the best power-law ﬁt using
the maximum likelihood method [13]. Table 2 shows the
estimated power-law coeﬃcient along with the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov goodness-of-ﬁt metric [13]. While the best power-
law coeﬃcients approximate the distributions very well for
Flickr, LiveJournal, and YouTube, the Orkut data deviates
signiﬁcantly.
Two factors contribute to this deviation. First, our Orkut

crawl reached only 11.3% of the network — partial BFS
crawls tend to undersample nodes with lower degree, which
can explain the ﬂat head of the distribution [29]. Second,
both LiveJournal and Orkut artiﬁcially cap a user’s num-
ber of outgoing links,9 which leads to a distortion in the
distribution for high degrees.
Additionally, we tested the stability of the power-law co-
eﬃcient estimates by running the maximum likelihood esti-
mator over varyingly sized subsamples of our data [53]. We
found that the estimates of the power-law coeﬃcient were
remarkably stable; the estimates varied by less than 6% from
those provided in Table 2 when we considered as few as 1,000
data points.
Table 2 also shows a diﬀerence between the structure of
social networks and that of previously observed networks.
In the Web, for example, the indegree and outdegree power-
law exponents have been shown to diﬀer signiﬁcantly, while
the power-law exponents for the indegree and outdegree dis-
tributions in each of our social networks are very similar.
This implies that in online social networks, the distribution
of outgoing links is similar to that of incoming links, while in
the Web, the incoming links are signiﬁcantly more concen-
trated on a few high-degree nodes than the outgoing links.
Focusing on this diﬀerence, Figure 3 shows the distribu-
tion of incoming and outgoing links over nodes in the Web
9Orkut caps the outdegree at 1,000, and LiveJournal at 750.
Both of these caps were instituted after the networks were
established, and some users therefore exceed the caps. Also,
Flickr has since instituted a cap of 3,000 non-reciprocal links;
however, the data shown here was collected before this cap
was established.

and Flickr graphs.10 The diﬀerence is readily apparent: 5%
of the Web nodes account for 75% of all incoming links, but
for only 25% of all outgoing links.
In all social networks
we considered, the distributions of incoming and outgoing
links across the nodes are very similar. We now examine
this phenomenon in more detail.
5.3 Correlation of indegree and outdegree
Studies of the indegree and outdegree distributions in the
Web graph helped researchers ﬁnd better ways to ﬁnd rel-
evant information in the Web. In the Web, the population
of pages that are active (i.e., have high outdegree) is not
the same as the population of pages that are popular (i.e.,
have high indegree) [21]. For example, many Web pages of
individual users actively point to a few popular pages like
wikipedia.org or cnn.com. Web search techniques are very
eﬀective at separating a very small set of popular pages from
a much larger set of active pages.
In social networks, the nodes with very high outdegree
also tend to have very high indegree. In our study, for each
network, the top 1% of nodes ranked by indegree has a more
than 65% overlap with the top 1% of nodes ranked by out-
degree. The corresponding overlap in the Web is less than
20%. Hence, active users (i.e., those who create many links)

Outdegree to Indegree Ratio

Figure 5: CDF of outdegree to indegree ratio. Social
networks show much stronger correlation between
indegree and outdegree than the Web.
Next, we compared the indegree and outdegree of individ-
ual nodes in the social networks. Figure 5 plots the cumula-
tive distributions of the outdegree-to-indegree ratio for the
four social networks and the Web. The social networks show
a remarkable correspondence between indegree and outde-
gree; for all networks, over 50% of nodes have an indegree
within 20% of their outdegree. The distribution for the Web
is markedly diﬀerent; most nodes have considerably higher
outdegree than indegree, while a small fraction of nodes have
signiﬁcantly higher indegree than outdegree.
The high correlation between indegree and outdegree in
social networks can be explained by the high number of
symmetric links. The high symmetry may be due to the
tendency of users to reciprocate links from other users who
point to them. This process would result in active users (who
place many outgoing links) automatically receiving many in-
coming links, and lead to the distributions we have observed.
5.4 Path lengths and diameter
Next, we look at the properties of shortest paths between
users. Table 3 shows the average path lengths, diameters,
and radii11 for the four social networks. In absolute terms,
the path lengths and diameters for all four social networks

are remarkably short. Interestingly, despite being compara-
ble in size to the Web graph we considered, the social net-
works have signiﬁcantly shorter average path lengths and
diameters. This property may again result from the high
degree of reciprocity within the social networks.
Inciden-
tally, Broder et al. [12] noted that if the Web were treated
as an undirected graph, the average path length would drop
from 16.12 to 7.
5.5 Link degree correlations
To further explore the diﬀerence in network structure be-
tween online social networks and previously observed net-
works, we examine which users tend to connect to each
other. In particular, we focus on the joint degree distribu-
tion (JDD), or how often nodes of diﬀerent degrees connect
to each other. This property is also referred to as the 2K-
distribution [33] or the mixing patterns [42].
5.5.1 Joint degree distribution
The JDD provides many insights into the structural proper-
ties of networks. For example, networks where high-degree
nodes tend to connect to other high-degree nodes are more
likely to be subject to epidemics, as a single infected high-
degree node will quickly infect other high-degree nodes. On
the other hand, networks where high-degree nodes tend to
connect to low-degree nodes show the opposite behavior; a
single infected high-degree node will not spread an epidemic
very far.
The JDD is approximated by the degree correlation func-
tion knn, which is a mapping between outdegree and the
average indegree of all nodes connected to nodes of that out-
degree. Clearly, an increasing knn indicates a tendency of
higher-degree nodes to connect to other high-degree nodes;
a decreasing knn represents the opposite trend. Figure 6
shows a plot of knn for the four networks we studied.
The trend for high-degree nodes to connect to other high-
degree nodes can be observed in all networks except YouTube
(the unexpected bump at the head of the Orkut curve is
likely due to the undersampling of users). This suggests that
the high-degree nodes in social networks tend to connect to
other high-degree nodes, forming a “core” of the network.
Anecdotally, we believe that the diﬀerent behavior seen in
YouTube is due its more “celebrity”-driven nature; there are
a few extremely popular users on YouTube to whom many
unpopular users connect.
graph is then the minimum eccentricity across all vertices,
and the diameter is the maximum eccentricity across all
vertices. Due to the computational complexity associated
with determining the actual radius and diameter, the num-
bers presented here are from determining the eccentricity of
10,000 random nodes in each network. Therefore, the diam-
eter should be viewed as a lower bound, and the radius as
an upper bound.
