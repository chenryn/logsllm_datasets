## 1. Introduction to EFAIL and New Non-Crypto Attacks

### Recap: EFAIL (2022)
- **Major Attack with a Logo:** EFAIL was a significant attack that gained widespread attention.
- **Novel Techniques:** The attack introduced new methods targeting S/MIME and PGP.

### Current Focus: Non-Crypto Attacks
- **Targeting Encryption and Digital Signatures:** These attacks exploit the structure of emails rather than breaking cryptographic algorithms.

## 2. Overview

1. **Introduction**
2. **Attacks on Encryption**
3. **Attacks on Signatures**
4. **Evaluation**
5. **Mitigation**

## 3. Technology's Promise and Its Vulnerabilities

### Claims:
- **Strong Crypto is Virtually Unbreakable:** This claim is often made, but can be bypassed with non-crypto attacks.
- **Digital Signatures Will Prevail:** Even digital signatures can be compromised by manipulating email content.

### What If...
- A single reply to a benign-looking email could bypass these claims?

## 4. Traditional vs. Encrypted Emails

### Traditional RFC822 Email
```plaintext
From: PI:EMAIL
To: PI:EMAIL
Subject: Important news
Some ASCII text message…
```

### Traditional PGP/Inline
```plaintext
From: PI:EMAIL
To: PI:EMAIL
Subject: Important news
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
…
-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
```

### Multipart MIME Email
```plaintext
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="XXX"
--XXX
Content-Type: text/plain
Some ASCII text message…
--XXX
Content-Type: text/plain
This is the 2nd part
--XXX--
```

### Multipart MIME with Multiple Types
```plaintext
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="XXX"
--XXX
Content-Type: text/html
HTML message…
--XXX
Content-Type: application/pdf
%PDF-1.4 […]
--XXX--
```

### S/MIME
```plaintext
From: PI:EMAIL
To: PI:EMAIL
Subject: Important news
Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime
MIAGCSqGSIb3DQEHA6CAMIACAQAxggHJMIIB…
```

### OpenPGP (RFC 4880) vs. S/MIME (RFC 5751)
- **OpenPGP:**
  - Favored by privacy advocates.
  - Uses web-of-trust (no authorities).
- **S/MIME:**
  - Favored by organizations.
  - Utilizes multi-root trust-hierarchies.

## 5. Attacker Model

- **Eve has captured ciphertext.**
- **Can modify email structure.**
- **Can re-send it to the victim (either recipient or sender).**
- **Both can decrypt the email.**

## 6. Covert Content Attack: Decryption Oracle

### Example
```plaintext
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="XXX"
--XXX
Content-Type: text/plain
Secret message, for Johnny's eyes only…
--XXX
Content-Type: text/plain
What's up Johnny?
--XXX--
```

### Exploitation
- **Decryption Oracle:**
  - Manipulates the email structure to include both secret and benign messages.
  - The recipient sees the benign message, but the secret message is also decrypted.

## 7. Covert Content Attack: Signing Oracle

### Example
```plaintext
From: PI:EMAIL
To: PI:EMAIL
Content-Type: text/html
What's up Johnny?
I hereby declare war.
```

### Exploitation
- **Signing Oracle:**
  - Hides covert content on mobile devices but shows it on desktop devices.
  - The recipient signs the message, unknowingly including the covert content.

## 8. Evaluation

### Conditional Rules
- **Targeting Device Type (@media):** Hides content based on device type.
- **Targeting Email Client (@supports):** Hides content based on the email client.
- **Targeting User Account (@document):** Hides content based on the user account.

## 9. Mitigation

- **◐ Plaintext merged with attacker-text.**
- **○ No vulnerabilities found.**
- **– Cryptosystem not available.**

### Key Points
- **Decryption Oracles:** Covert rules are kept in the reply message.
- **Signature Oracles:** Covert rules apply only to received mail.

By understanding and mitigating these vulnerabilities, we can enhance the security of email end-to-end encryption.
