# Analysis and Estimation of Hidden Links in the AS-Graph

## 1. Introduction
This document provides an analysis of the number of hidden links in the Autonomous System (AS) graph, using a capture-recapture based technique. The results are validated against existing data and provide insights into the growth trends of the Internet.

## 2. Methodology and Results

### 2.1 AS-Graph Estimates for October 2007
The following figures and tables present the estimates of the AS-graph for October 2007, with respect to the number of classes \( C \).

- **(a) AIC Values**: The minimum value is indicated by a marker.
- **(b) Estimated Number of Links**: The number of links estimated.
- **(c) EM Iterations and CPU Times**: The number of iterations and the corresponding CPU times in seconds.

| Number of Classes \( C \) | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |
|----------------------------|---|---|---|----|
| EM Iterations              | 105 | 104 | 103 | 102 |
| CPU Time (seconds)         | 101 | 100 | 99  | 98  |

### 2.4 Trend in the Number of Links
**Figure 4: Trend in the Number of Links**

- **Asterisks**: Show previous estimates from [6, 9, 13].
- **Trend Estimate**: Growth rate of 18.7 links per day, compared to 16 per day for observed links.
- **Yearly Growth Rate**: Around 1,000 hidden links.

## 3. Class Analysis
### 3.1 Meaning of Classes
We have treated classes as an abstract division of the links, motivated by peer-to-peer (p2p) vs. customer-provider (c-p) links. The classes incorporate various factors, including geographic and topological bias.

**Figure 5: Breakdown of Link Types into Classes**

- **Class 1**: Largely made up of p2p links.
- **Classes 3-7**: Dominated by c-p and s2s links in roughly similar proportions.

**Table 3: % of Classes by Link Policies**

| Class | p2p (%) | c-p (%) | s2s (%) | Observed Links | Estimated Links |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1     | 74.25   | 2.32    | 2.33    | 4,830          | 15,990          |
| 2     | 14.50   | 4.27    | 6.98    |                |                 |
| 3     | 2.66    | 4.01    | 5.81    |                |                 |
| 4     | 1.75    | 6.31    | 0.78    |                |                 |
| 5     | 1.43    | 8.92    | 3.49    |                |                 |
| 6     | 1.09    | 5.04    | 5.81    |                |                 |
| 7     | 4.33    | 69.12   | 74.81   | 48,760         | 57,400          |
| Total | 90%     | 90%+    | 90%+    | 258            | 300             |

## 4. Monitor Requirements
### 4.1 Number of Monitors Needed
To guarantee observing a given link from class 1 with probability \( 1 - q_j \), we need:

\[ K = \left\lceil \frac{\ln(q_1)}{\ln(1 - p_1)} \right\rceil \]

For \( q_1 = 0.05, 0.01, \) and \( 0.001 \), the required number of monitors \( K \) is 299, 459, and 684, respectively.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper provides a method for estimating the number of hidden links in the AS-graph. The technique performs well against the best available validation data and allows us to estimate the trend in the size of the Internet. We estimate that 700 route monitors would see at least 99.9% of links. Future work includes improving the model and investigating the possibility of missing entire classes of links.
