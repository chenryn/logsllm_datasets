## Abstract
Tor users are vulnerable to deanonymization by adversaries who can observe certain Tor relays or parts of the network. We demonstrate that previous network-aware path-selection algorithms, which aim to address this problem, are still susceptible to attacks across multiple Tor connections. We propose a trust-based approach for path selection, where trust is modeled as a probability distribution over the locations of potential adversaries. This Trust-Aware Path Selection (TAPS) algorithm helps users avoid traffic-analysis attacks while maintaining the anonymity provided by the default path selection. We evaluate TAPS in two scenarios using a high-level map of Internet routing: (i) avoiding a global adversary with a chance to control each Autonomous System (AS), Internet Exchange Point (IXP), and Tor relay family, and (ii) avoiding deanonymization by any single country. We also assess the performance of TAPS using the Shadow network simulator.

## 1. Introduction
Tor is a widely used tool for low-latency anonymous communication, with an estimated 1.5 million daily users. Clients establish a three-hop path from over 7000 volunteer relays, chosen based on available bandwidth. This path consists of an entry guard, middle relay, and exit relay, providing cryptographic unlinkability against passive, non-global adversaries.

However, a global adversary capable of observing both ends of a circuit can perform "first-last" traffic-correlation attacks, matching traffic patterns to deanonymize users. Such adversaries can observe or control significant portions of the network, including ASes, IXPs, and fast relays.

Previous approaches to improving resilience against traffic observation and correlation attacks have been limited. One approach focuses on avoiding AS or IXP observation, but it fails to account for multiple connections, which can leak information about the client's location. Another approach involves choosing trusted relays, but it can be compromised through congestion attacks and has a restrictive trust model.

In contrast, our paper develops defenses against traffic correlation using a general probabilistic model of network adversaries. This model considers diverse resources, such as network providers, exchange points, physical cables, and Tor relays. Users express their trust beliefs by specifying a probability distribution over potential adversary locations and a weight indicating their level of concern.

We design Trust-Aware Path Selection (TAPS), a novel path-selection algorithm that minimizes the probability of an adversary observing both ends of a Tor circuit while ensuring that the user's path selection behavior does not stand out. TAPS addresses the deficiencies of prior proposals and provides security against adversaries that can monitor and link user activity across multiple connections.

For adoption, we propose both long-term and short-term strategies. In the long term, all Tor users would use the TrustAll version of TAPS. In the short term, security-conscious users can opt for the TrustOne version, which blends in with standard Tor usage.

We evaluate TAPS using modified versions of the Tor Path Simulator (TorPS) and the Shadow simulator. Our analysis shows a significant reduction in the probability of successful first-last attacks and the number of countries that can compromise a stream.

## 2. Attacks on Network-Aware Path Selection
Several proposals aim to improve Tor security by considering network entities that can observe a circuit. However, these proposals do not consider anonymity across multiple connections, which is essential for realistic Tor usage. We present two specific attacks that can deanonymize users by analyzing multiple connections:

### A. Multiple-Connection Attacks
#### Chosen-Destination Attack
An adversary running web servers and Tor relays can force a client to visit multiple malicious servers, linking these connections to the same client. By observing the exits and guards, the adversary can infer the client's location. This attack is particularly effective against path-selection algorithms like Astoria, which choose relays based on the client's location.

To demonstrate, we construct an AS-level Internet map using traceroute data, inferred AS relationships, and BGP routing tables. We simulate Astoria's path selections for 1000 random destination ASes, repeating the simulation 100 times. We assume the adversary runs the four most likely middle relays.

Table 1 shows the probability of the adversary observing the client's guards as the number of destinations increases. With 300 destinations, the adversary observes all guards with 94% probability.

| Destinations | Pr. 0 Guards Observed | Pr. 1 Guard Observed | Pr. 2 Guards Observed | Pr. 3 Guards Observed |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 0            | 0.96                  | 0.04                 | 0                      | 0                      |
| 100          | 0.04                  | 0.14                 | 0.52                   | 0.30                   |
| 200          | 0                     | 0.01                 | 0.25                   | 0.74                   |
| 300          | 0                     | 0                    | 0.06                   | 0.94                   |

Figure 1 shows the average entropy of the posterior client-AS distribution as the number of attack destinations increases. By 300 destinations, the entropy is less than 4 bits, and by 1000 destinations, it is less than 2.5 bits for all locations. Identifying the client AS can reveal the user's country and ISP, posing a significant risk.

This attack can be completed within seconds, highlighting the need for more robust path-selection algorithms.
