User: How to perform load balancing and disaster recovery backup for large-scale website services, and ensure high availability and data security?
Assistant: To achieve load balancing and disaster recovery backup of large-scale website services while ensuring high availability and data security, the following measures can generally be adopted: 1. Use load balancing technology to distribute traffic to multiple servers to disperse a single server The pressure to ensure the stability and reliability of the website. 2. Set up the master-standby relationship in multiple servers. Once a server fails, it can be switched to the standby server in time to ensure the continuity and high availability of website services. 3. Perform data backup for the entire system. When the main server has a problem, it can quickly switch to the backup server and restore the backup data to the main server. 4. To perform data redundancy backup on the database, you can use master-slave backup or synchronous active-active mode to ensure high availability and security of database data. 5. Use web application firewall technology to prevent DDoS and other attacks, and prevent website services from being down due to malicious attacks. 6. Establish a monitoring system to monitor the entire website system in real time, discover and deal with faults in time, and improve the stability and reliability of the website server. 7. Establish a security authentication system to strengthen the protection of important data such as user information and transaction data, prevent data leakage and theft, and ensure the security and reliability of user data.
