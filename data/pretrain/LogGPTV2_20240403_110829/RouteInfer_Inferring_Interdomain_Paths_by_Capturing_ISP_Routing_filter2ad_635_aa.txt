Abstract. Accurate inference of interdomain paths between arbitrary
source and destination is the foundation for many research areas, espe-
cially for the security of the Internet routing system. The widely used
method to solve this problem is using standard policies based on the
business relationship model, but it is far from satisfactory. We conduct
an in-depth analysis on the inherent limitations of the path inference by
standard routing policies and show that the routing behaviors of ISPs are
diverse and standard import policies are oversimpliﬁed. Then we develop
RouteInfer, an algorithm for accurately inferring interdomain paths by
capturing ISP routing behaviors diversity and generality. RouteInfer uses
a 3-layer policy model to extract the ﬁne-grained policies and coarse-
grained policies of ASes and can achieve high accuracy as well as good
generalization ability. After extracting policies, we ﬁnd another inherent
challenge that there is still a huge number of ASes without inferred poli-
cies. To overcome this challenge, RouteInfer formulates the prediction of
route decisions as a ranking problem and develops a learning-based app-
roach especially for predicting route decisions. We carefully design node,
link, and path features based on the understanding of actual route deci-
sions. Overall, on average, RouteInfer achieves 81.64% accuracy. Com-
pared with state-of-the-art inference algorithms, RouteInfer increases the
inference accuracy by about 30.04% to 182.3%. Furthermore, we analyze
the inferred policies and the route decision model to understand routing
behaviors deeply. We ﬁnd that many ASes set ﬁne-grained policies for
CDN ASes. Besides, most of the violations of the standard preference
rule are related to p2p links in European IXPs.

destinations. The interdomain routing protocol (i.e., BGP) and a huge num-
ber of network operators together determine the selected paths between any
source-destination pairs in the Internet. Interdomain path inference is of great
importance for a wide range of applications and research areas, such as deploying
BGP security mechanisms [1–3], optimizing peer-to-peer applications [4], design-
ing routing-based attacks and countermeasures towards bitcoin [5–8], censorship
[9,10], Tor [11], etc.
The widely used method to solve this problem is using standard routing
policies in the business relationship model [12]. The business relationship model
assumes there are commonly two classes of AS relationships including customer-
provider (c2p) and peer-peer (p2p). In terms of standard import policies, each AS
sets local preferences as follow (which we also call the standard preference rule):
prefer paths received from customers over paths received from peers over path
received from providers. In terms of standard export policies, ASes would never
announce routes received from a provider or a peer towards another provider or
peer (also called the valley-free rule).
However, prior works have found path inference based on standard policies
performs poorly [13,14]. In this paper, we ﬁrst use multiple data sources to take
an in-depth look at the problem of path inference by standard policies, including
BGP routing data, Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data, and BGP community
data. The analysis shows that interdomain path inference by standard policies
is faced with several fundamental problems. First, routing behaviors of ISPs
are diverse, i.e., ISPs not only consider the business relationships with neighbor
ASes when setting policies but also set policies for a speciﬁc preﬁx (which are
denoted as preﬁx policies) or a speciﬁc destination AS (which are denoted as
destination AS policies) or a speciﬁc neighbor (which are denoted as neighbor
policies) to achieve their performance or economical goals. Three kinds of policies
(preﬁx policies, destination AS policies, and neighbor policies) are all widely
used by each AS. Over 40% ASes set multiple kinds of policies. However, to our
knowledge, all inference algorithms [4,15–18] use the single-kind policy model
to model routing policies, e.g., modeling all policies by preﬁx policies [15–17], or
neighbor policies [4], or standard policies [18]. Second, the inaccuracy of path
inference is mainly due to the oversimpliﬁed standard import policies. Third,
there is still a huge number of ASes whose policies we cannot infer from BGP
routing data. Prior works use some naive default policies as the routing policies
of those ASes. But we prove that they also perform poorly in path inference.
These problems are overlooked by state-of-the-art inference algorithms.
To address the above problems, we design and develop RouteInfer1, an algo-
rithm that infers interdomain paths between arbitrary sources and destinations
in the Internet by capturing ISP routing behavior diversity and generality. First,
to capture routing behavior diversity, RouteInfer uses a 3-layer policy model to
model ISP routing policies. The 3-layer policy model uses three kinds of policies
to represent an AS’s routing behaviors. Each AS has ﬁne-grained policies and

coarse-grained policies at the same time. We try to infer the internal details
of an AS’s policies as much as possible. Second, to predict route decisions of
ASes without inferred policies, we explore the intrinsic generality and similarity
of route decisions among diﬀerent ASes. RouteInfer uses a kind of data-driven
approach, learning to rank, to train a route decision model learned from empir-
ical data. Our model considers various well-designed useful attributes including
node, link, and path features. We use the model to predict route decisions of
ASes without inferred policies.
Overall, RouteInfer takes into account a full consideration of the diversity
and generality of routing behaviors among ISPs. Our evaluations show that, on
average, RouteInfer achieves 81.64% accuracy. Compared to the current state-
of-the-art algorithms, RouteInfer increases the accuracy by about 30.04% to
182.3%. The two key components (3-layer policy model and route decision model)
both beneﬁt the whole algorithm. Compared with single-kind policy models,
our 3-layer policy model increases the accuracy by up to 133% and has good
generalization ability. The route decision model based on the learning to rank
algorithm performs up to 313% better than predicting route decisions by default
policies and is an explainable model which gives us opportunities to understand
routing behaviors deeply.
Furthermore, we conduct analyses of inferred policies and the explainable
route decision model to improve our understanding of ISP routing behaviors.
We make the following observations from the analysis:
– ASes in high tiers tend to set ﬁne-grained policies while ASes in low tiers
tend to set coarse-grained policies.
– We ﬁnd that many ASes set preﬁx policies for the preﬁxes belonging to CDN
ASes.
– We ﬁnd the tier of next-hop AS is the most important feature in the route
decision model. The business relationship is a less important feature in the
route decision.
– We ﬁnd that many ASes prefer the routes received from providers to the
routes received from peers, which does not follow the standard preference
rule. We also ﬁnd those violations are related to p2p links in European IXPs.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces existing research
eﬀorts in interdomain path inference. Section 3 discusses the inherent problems
in path inference by standard policies. Section 4 details RouteInfer’s design and
implementation. Section 5 compares RouteInfer with state-of-the-art algorithms.
Analyses of inferred policies and the route decision model are also presented in
Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 Related Work
Inferring interdomain paths have been a long-standing problem in the past two
decades and the pioneering and most classic approach is using standard routing
policies [12,19] proposed by Lixin Gao and Jennifer Rexford. Several algorithms
RouteInfer: Inferring Interdomain Paths
219
[18,20] infer interdomain paths by computing paths that are compliant with
standard policies. However, many works [13,21] have proven the accuracy is
disappointing.
Thus some researchers try to conduct measurement analysis to understand
routing behaviors of ASes in the real world [13–15,21,22]. First, they ﬁnd that
business relationships are too coarse-grained to model routing policies [13,14].
For example, Anwar et al. [14] ﬁnd about 14–35% of route decisions cannot be
explained by the business relationship model and preﬁx policies can explain 10–
20% of unexpected routing decisions. Second, Muhlbauer et al. [13] ﬁnd that
ﬁne-grained policies can be aggregated into coarse-grained policies and actual
routing policies are somewhere in-between preﬁx policies and neighbor policies.
Third, they ﬁnd the main problem of standard policies is the standard preference
rule rather than the standard export policy rule [13,21,22]. For example, Deng et
al. [21] ﬁnd that using the standard preference rule causes signiﬁcant degradation
of the overall accuracy, compared with only using standard export policies to
infer paths. Giotsas et al. [22] use the BGP community data to infer ground-
truth of export policies and found only 1.7% of paths violate the valley-free rule.
Fourth, Muhlbauer et al. [15] found the path diversity in Internet routing, i.e.,
there may exist multiple paths between a source AS to a destination preﬁx. One
router per AS is not suﬃcient to capture path diversity because one router only
contains one route towards a destination preﬁx.
Inspired by the above measurement and analysis studies, several works pro-
posed the improvement of path inference algorithms [4,15–17]. To overcome the
challenge of path diversity, Muhlbauer et al. [15] allow each AS to consist of
multiple quasi-routers. A quasi-router is a logical router rather than a physi-
cal router. A quasi-router represents part of routers in an AS that all choose
the same best path towards a destination. If an AS has multiple paths towards
a preﬁx, then multiple quasi-routers account for each route towards the pre-
ﬁx. To overcome the challenge that business relationship is too coarse-grained,
researchers proposed to use ﬁne-grained policy models to infer routing policies.
For example, [15–17] model ISP routing policies by a preﬁx policy model (i.e.,
each policy is set for a speciﬁc destination preﬁx). Madhyastha et al. [4] model
policies by a neighbor policy model (i.e. each policy is set for a speciﬁc neighbor).
In this paper, we prove modeling routing policies by single-kind models cannot
capture ISP routing behaviors diversity and cannot achieve high accuracy. To
solve this problem, we propose to use a three-layer policy model to extract and
represent the routing policies of ASes.
Many works [16,17] have found that if inferring paths by ﬁne-grained policy
model such as preﬁx policy model, there are some ASes whose policies they
cannot infer. To tackle this problem, prior works use default policies for those
ASes without inferred policies. For example, Muhlbauer et al. [15] let the ASes
without inferred policies select the shortest path when they make route decisions,
[16,17] use standard policies as the default policies of the ASes without inferred
policies. Tian et al. [23] are the ﬁrst to introduce a data-driven learning-based
approach to model route decisions of ISPs. However, they only use one kind
220
T. Wu et al.
of feature which cannot capture enough information related to route decisions.
In this paper, we develop a particular learning-based approach to train a route
decision model for predicting the route decisions of the ASes without policies. We
take full consideration of node, link, and path features related to route decisions
in practice.
3 Limitation of Standard Routing Policy
In this section, we elaborate the inherent problems of using standard policies to
infer interdomain paths.
The widely used standard policies for path inference is based on the business
relationship model [19]. The model assumes that all ASes set standard routing
policies on the basis of neighbor’s relationship. Standard routing policies say all
ASes prefer routes learned from customers over routes learned from peers over
routes learned from providers and they would never announce routes learned
from a provider or a peer towards another provider or peer. However, there are
at least two problems. First, if multiple neighbors with the same relationship
send routes towards a preﬁx to an AS a, which one AS a prefers? Second, if
AS a receives multiple shortest paths with the highest preference, which one to
choose? Standard routing policies cannot answer these questions. Besides, the
terrible accuracy (only 14% in prior validations [13,21]) also arouses our curios-
ity. Therefore, we have a strong temptation to answer the questions: “Whether
standard routing policies can capture ISP routing behaviors? If not, why?” We
conduct three measurement experiments based on three data sources to ﬁnd
the answer. The details of the datasets and the process of data sanitization are
presented in Sect. 5.1.

BGP Routing Table. We ﬁrst use BGP routing tables to ﬁnd the answer.
We split BGP routing data into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%). The
training set is used to infer business relationships between ASes by the state-of-
the-art AS relationship inference algorithm AS-Rank [24]. Based on the topology
with relationships, we infer AS paths towards the destination ASes in the test
set. We simulate the process of route announcement and route decision of the
RouteInfer: Inferring Interdomain Paths
221
ASes in the Internet according to standard policies. After routing convergence,
we examine whether the inferred paths are consistent with the observed paths
in the test set. For example, there is a path AS1, AS2, AS3, AS4, p1 in the test
set. p1 is the destination preﬁx and AS4 is the destination AS. We ﬁrst examine
the inferred path between AS3 to p1, then between AS2 to p1, then between
AS1 to p1. Once we ﬁnd a mismatch (supposing the inferred path between AS2
to p1 is not equal to AS2, AS3, AS4), then we stop the examination and try to
ﬁnd reasons of the mismatch. There are three kinds of reasons. (1) Violation of
standard export policy: a neighbor AS should not announce the best route to
the AS in standard export policy, while the neighbor AS announces in reality,
(2) Violation of standard import policy: an AS chooses a route received from
a provider rather than the route received from a customer, or chooses a route
received from a provider rather than the route received from a peer, or chooses
a route received from a peer rather than the route received from a customer, (3)
No answer in standard import policies: no answer means that standard import
policies do not tell us which one is the best route among several routes with
the highest preference and shortest path length. If an AS does not choose the
best route among several routes with the highest preference and shortest path
length, then we say this path is inferred wrongly due to the no answer problem
in standard import policies.
Figure 1(a) shows the result. Only 3.66% of paths are inferred wrongly due
to violation of standard export policy. 35.64% of paths are inferred wrongly due
to violation of standard import policy and 47.04% of paths are due to no answer
in standard import policies. Obviously, violation of standard import policies and
the no answer problem are the main culprits of terrible accuracy.
