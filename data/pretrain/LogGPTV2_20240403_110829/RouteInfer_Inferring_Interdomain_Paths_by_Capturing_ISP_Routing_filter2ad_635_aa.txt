## Abstract
Accurate inference of interdomain paths between arbitrary source and destination ASes is fundamental to many research areas, particularly for the security of the Internet routing system. The widely used method based on standard policies derived from business relationship models has been found to be inadequate. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the inherent limitations of path inference using standard routing policies, highlighting the diversity and complexity of ISP routing behaviors. We introduce RouteInfer, an algorithm that accurately infers interdomain paths by capturing this diversity and generality. RouteInfer employs a 3-layer policy model to extract both fine-grained and coarse-grained policies, achieving high accuracy and good generalization. To address the challenge of ASes without inferred policies, RouteInfer formulates route decision prediction as a ranking problem and develops a learning-based approach. Our experiments show that RouteInfer achieves an average accuracy of 81.64%, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 182.3%. Additionally, we analyze the inferred policies and the route decision model to gain deeper insights into ISP routing behaviors.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet routing infrastructure plays a crucial role in ensuring the reachability and availability of online services. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and a large number of network operators collectively determine the paths between any source-destination pairs. Accurate interdomain path inference is essential for various applications, including BGP security mechanisms, peer-to-peer application optimization, and designing routing-based attacks and countermeasures.

The traditional approach to interdomain path inference relies on standard routing policies based on the business relationship model, which assumes two types of relationships: customer-provider (c2p) and peer-peer (p2p). However, prior studies have shown that this method performs poorly. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis using multiple data sources, including BGP routing data, Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data, and BGP community data. Our analysis reveals several fundamental issues with standard policy-based inference, such as the diversity of ISP routing behaviors and the oversimplification of standard import policies.

To address these issues, we develop RouteInfer, an algorithm that captures the diversity and generality of ISP routing behaviors. RouteInfer uses a 3-layer policy model to represent both fine-grained and coarse-grained policies and employs a learning-based approach to predict route decisions for ASes without inferred policies. Our evaluations demonstrate that RouteInfer significantly improves path inference accuracy compared to existing methods.

## 2. Related Work
Interdomain path inference has been a long-standing problem, with the most classic approach being the use of standard routing policies. Several algorithms infer paths by computing routes compliant with these policies, but their accuracy is often disappointing. Recent studies have focused on understanding real-world routing behaviors through measurements, revealing that business relationships are too coarse-grained and that fine-grained policies are necessary. Some works have proposed improvements, such as using multiple quasi-routers per AS and fine-grained policy models. However, these approaches still face challenges, such as the inability to capture diverse routing behaviors and the need for default policies for ASes without inferred policies.

## 3. Limitations of Standard Routing Policies
Standard policies for path inference are based on the business relationship model, which assumes that ASes prefer routes from customers over peers and providers. However, this model has significant limitations. For example, it does not specify how to handle multiple routes from neighbors with the same relationship or multiple shortest paths. Our analysis using BGP routing tables, IRR data, and BGP community data shows that violations of standard import policies and the lack of clear answers in standard import policies are the main reasons for poor inference accuracy.

## 4. Design and Implementation of RouteInfer
RouteInfer addresses the limitations of standard policies by using a 3-layer policy model to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained policies. The 3-layer model includes prefix policies, destination AS policies, and neighbor policies. To predict route decisions for ASes without inferred policies, RouteInfer formulates the problem as a ranking task and uses a learning-based approach. The model considers various features, including node, link, and path attributes, to make accurate predictions.

## 5. Evaluation and Analysis
Our evaluations show that RouteInfer achieves an average accuracy of 81.64%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. The 3-layer policy model and the learning-based route decision model both contribute to the improved performance. We also analyze the inferred policies and the route decision model to gain insights into ISP routing behaviors, finding that high-tier ASes tend to set fine-grained policies, while low-tier ASes set coarse-grained policies. Additionally, many ASes set specific policies for CDN ASes and prefer routes from providers over peers, especially in European IXPs.

## 6. Conclusion
This paper presents RouteInfer, an algorithm for accurate interdomain path inference that captures the diversity and generality of ISP routing behaviors. Our evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of RouteInfer and provide valuable insights into ISP routing practices.
