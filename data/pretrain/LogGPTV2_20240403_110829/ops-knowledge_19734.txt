User: We need to monitor the disk space usage on the server, and automatically trigger an alarm when the space is insufficient. Please provide an implementation plan.
Assistant: The following is an implementation plan: 1. First, you need to install a monitoring tool, such as Zabbix, Nagios or Prometheus, etc. These tools can monitor the disk usage of the server and provide real-time status reports and alarm functions. 2. Use email or SMS notification to create an alarm, and you can choose to use SMTP email, SMTPS email, SMS interface, etc. according to the actual situation. 3. In the monitoring tool, set the threshold of disk usage, once the disk usage reaches the preset value, an alarm can be triggered automatically. For example, set disk usage to send an alert at 80% or send a critical alert at 90%. 4. In order to avoid false positives and inexplicable alarms, it is recommended to confirm before the alarm, for example, by verifying a script or manual operation to understand the specific disk usage. 5. Finally, it is necessary to regularly maintain and update monitoring tools, adjust thresholds and other maintenance work in time to maintain the best monitoring effect of monitoring tools.
