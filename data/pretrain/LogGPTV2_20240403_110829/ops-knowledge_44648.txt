User: Please analyze the structure of IP address and IP address classification.
Assistant: IP address structure: An IP address is a 32-bit binary number, which is usually divided into four 8-digit numbers (that is, 4 bytes) and presented in a decimal point segmented format, usually in the form of XXXX. IP address classification: According to the division method of IP addresses, IP addresses can be divided into five categories: A, B, C, D, and E. Class A address: 7-bit binary number starting with 0, such as 0.XXX to 127.XXX, the highest bit of the first byte is 0, the remaining 7 bits are used to identify the network, and the last three bytes are used to Identify the host. Therefore, the network number of a class A address uses the first byte, and the host number uses the remaining three bytes. Class B address: 14-bit binary number starting with 10, such as 128.0.XX to 191.255.XX, the first two bytes are used to identify the network, and the last two bytes are used to identify the host. Class C address: 21-bit binary number starting with 110, such as 192.0.0.X to 223.255.255.X, the first three bytes are used to identify the network, and the last byte is used to identify the host. Class D address: 28-bit binary number starting with 1110, such as 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, used for multicast. Class E addresses: 31-bit binary numbers starting with 11110, such as 240.0.0.0 to 247.255.255.255, are reserved addresses and are not allocated for use.
