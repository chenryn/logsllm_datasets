**Notes:**
1. EDB does not sell its software by perpetual license. The license to use all EDB Postgres software is bundled into a yearly subscription that includes all licensing, software maintenance, and support costs.
2. Oracle core factors affect the list price of the database depending on the hardware architecture employed. For example, if deploying on commodity x86 hardware, Oracle’s per-core prices listed above would be reduced to $23,750. However, after adding in commonly used and popular features such as RAC, Active Data Guard, Partitioning, and Spatial, the price increases to $55,500 per core.
3. EDB Postgres provides the ability for a single database program instance to manage multiple databases (i.e., database schemas) independently and in this sense is multi-tenant. However, this is only a subset of the features in Oracle’s multi-tenant database.

### Hidden Costs of Moving Off Oracle

Many companies move away from Oracle to another database, but often not one that is compatible with Oracle. This introduces two significant hidden costs: learning a new SQL dialect for new applications and rewriting old business logic into the new SQL dialect when migrating applications.

While many databases adhere to the SQL standard, they do so to varying degrees. Learning a new SQL dialect and rewriting code takes longer than using existing SQL skills and code. In general, new SQL dialects can be learned, but the process can be tricky and prolonged. Syntax and semantics of commands can differ, leading to unexpected application behaviors, more bugs, more testing, and slower deployment times until mastery is achieved.

For example, Oracle has numerous SQL extensions that are not part of the SQL standard but provide features desirable by developers and DBAs. While convenient when using Oracle, these features can become troublesome when moving off Oracle because analogous features may not be present in the new database.

### Hidden Savings of Moving Off Oracle

Organizations using EDB Postgres instead of Oracle enjoy various real, year-after-year hidden savings. These savings are realized when updating or migrating applications, writing new applications, and operating and managing an EDB Postgres database infrastructure.

By using an Oracle-compatible database like EDB Postgres, a company’s key asset and competitive differentiator—its business logic written in PL/SQL—is preserved, avoiding the risks and delays inherent in rewriting the application.

EDB Postgres dramatically reduces the hidden costs described in the previous section by providing a SQL language that is compatible with Oracle’s PL/SQL. This means that application developers and DBAs can continue using the same Oracle commands and techniques they use today for new applications. When migrating applications from Oracle to EDB Postgres, little to no re-writing of business logic is needed.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server understands and executes Oracle PL/SQL natively, without compatibility layers, emulation engines, or code translations to another SQL dialect. This produces the same results and behavior you expect from Oracle, avoiding the poorer performance and development delays associated with non-native execution strategies.

With EDB Postgres, you still need to test any applications migrated from Oracle, but this represents the bulk of your effort and is much faster to complete and repair with fewer errors than a complete rewrite of your Oracle code.

EDB Postgres provides additional savings in the form of fewer bugs, fewer rewrites, less time, and fewer risks for IT managers who are accustomed to building in significant amounts of these expense factors when planning a change to an existing application regime.

Further savings are achieved when writing new applications, with shorter learning cycles and fewer mistakes. EDB Postgres enables very short learning times for your staff in multiple ways:

- Developers can continue using their Oracle PL/SQL skills and not learn an entirely new language.
- Time-saving function packages written in Oracle can be brought over to EDB Postgres for use with new or migrated applications, preventing additional code rewrites.
- Oracle views of database objects allow DBAs to inspect and analyze their EDB Postgres databases the same way they did with Oracle without learning completely new names and techniques.
- Compatible versions of important everyday tools like SQL*Plus and SQL*Loader are available in EDB Postgres, ensuring staff become productive immediately.
- A Replication tool, XA support, Database Links, and Data Adapters ensure minimal time is required to integrate EDB Postgres applications into existing Oracle environments.

### Long-Term Operational Cost Savings

A common argument made by traditional database vendors against open-source-based alternatives is that, while initial acquisition costs may be lower, the ongoing annual operational costs will be much higher. However, EDB customers have found the opposite to be true.

In an IDC research paper investigating the ROI of using EDB Postgres, it was found that EDB customers enjoyed an average of 42% reduction in their three-year cost of operations. The result was a composite analysis across multiple organizations of different sizes and industries (e.g., Natural Resources, Transportation, Communications, Financial Services, Professional Services, Education). The cost of operations was categorized as IT staff time spent deploying and configuring databases, as well as the time spent maintaining and administering them.

To quote one organization participating in the analysis:
"The administration around EnterpriseDB as compared to other databases is relatively low. We didn’t expect this and calculated that we would have to invest more time in administrating the database, but that was not true. It’s even less... I think what’s important is that Postgres is less complex than some other database management systems."

In the same research paper, EDB Postgres users attributed additional operational savings to Risk Mitigation, User Productivity Benefits, Business Productivity Benefits, IT Infrastructure Cost Reductions, and IT Staff Productivity Benefits. For a more detailed look at the data and analysis on savings attributable to using EDB Postgres and customer comments, download the white paper: *The Economic and Business Advantages of EnterpriseDB Postgres Database Solutions*.

### Reducing the Risks of Adoption

While cost savings are a key driver for moving off Oracle, achieving those savings is not without risk. EDB makes a special effort to reduce the technical, re-training, and integration risks of deploying EDB Postgres in an Oracle environment by developing compatible software and tools.

For more details on exactly how database compatibility is achieved, view the 12-minute video titled: *Database Compatibility for Oracle® Explained*.

However, while compatible software is necessary, it is not sufficient to ensure success. The software must also be adopted in a proven and efficient way that introduces change while minimizing risk, maximizing savings, and clearly demonstrating the benefits being pursued. Many factors must be accounted for in the adoption process, including:

- Application Profile
- Risk
- Time
- Effort
- Benefits
- Savings

EDB has years of experience helping customers navigate the waters of Postgres adoption. The following table shows a multi-customer composite of a prototypical EDB Postgres adoption roadmap.

**EDB Postgres Adoption Roadmap**

| **Application Profile** | **Risk** | **Time** | **Effort** | **Benefits** | **Savings** |
