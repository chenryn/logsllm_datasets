In an environment where database costs are mismatched to their usage value, and businesses are
under pressure to modernize, price does matter and redirecting budget from the likes of Oracle to new
applications can make a huge difference in IT and business initiatives.
Below are the acquisition costs for the databases and selected options.

Note 1: EDB does not sell its software by perpetual license. The license to use all EDB Postgres software
is bundled into a yearly subscription that includes all licensing, software maintenance and support costs.
Note 2: Oracle core factors affect the list price of the database depending on the hardware architecture
employed. For example, if deploying on commodity x86 hardware, then Oracle’s per-core prices listed
above would be reduced to $23,750. However, after adding in commonly used and popular features such
as RAC, Active Data Guard, Partitioning, and Spatial, the price increases to $55,500 per core.
Note 3: EDB Postgres provides the ability for a single database program instance to manage multiple
databases (i.e. database schemas) independently and in this sense is multi-tenant. However that is only a
subset of the features in Oracle’s multi-tenant database.

THE HIDDEN COSTS OF
MOVING OFF ORACLE
Many companies move off Oracle to another database but often not one that is compatible with Oracle.
This introduces two significant hidden costs: learning a new dialect of SQL for new applications and re-
writing old business logic into the new SQL dialect when migrating applications.
While many databases adhere to the SQL standard per se, they do so to different degrees. Learning a
new SQL dialect and re-writing code takes longer than using existing SQL skills and code. In general,
new dialects of SQL can be learned but that process can be tricky and prolonged.
Syntax and the semantics of commands can be different and cause unexpected application behaviors
creating more bugs to track down and fix, more testing, and slower deployment times overall until
mastery is achieved.
For example, Oracle has numerous SQL extensions that are not part of the SQL standard but provide
features desirable by developers and DBAs. While convenient when using Oracle, they can become
troublesome when moving off Oracle because analogous features aren’t present in your new database.

THE HIDDEN SAVINGS OF
MOVING OFF ORACLE
There are a variety of real year-after-year hidden savings enjoyed by organizations using EDB Postgres
instead of Oracle. Real bottom line savings are achieved when updating or migrating applications, writing
new applications, and operating and managing an EDB Postgres database infrastructure.
By using an Oracle compatible database like EDB Postgres, one of a company’s key assets and
competitive differentiators — their business logic written in PL/SQL — is preserved and avoids the many
risks and delays inherent in rewriting the application.
EDB Postgres dramatically reduces the hidden costs described in the previous section by providing a
SQL language that is compatible with Oracle’s PL/SQL. This means that application developers and DBAs
can continue using the same Oracle commands and techniques they use today for new applications.
It also means that when migrating applications from Oracle to EDB Postgres, little to no re-writing of
business logic is needed.
EDB Postgres Advanced Server understands and executes Oracle PL/SQL natively – there are no
compatibility layers, emulation engines, or code translations to another SQL dialect. EDB Postgres
produces the same results and behavior you expect from Oracle so you don’t suffer the poorer
performance and development delays associated with non-native execution strategies.

With EDB Postgres, you still need to test any applications migrated from Oracle but that represents the
bulk of your effort and is much faster to complete and repair with fewer errors than a complete rewrite of
your Oracle code.
EDB Postgres provides additional savings in the form of fewer bugs, fewer rewrites, less time, and fewer
risks for IT managers who are accustomed to building in significant amounts of these expense factors
when planning a change to an existing application regime.
Further savings in using EDB Postgres are achieved when writing new applications – shorter learning
cycles and fewer mistakes. EDB Postgres enables very short learning times for your staff in multiple
ways by allowing them to continue using their years of investment in Oracle skills in the EDB Postgres
environment:
• EDB Postgres allows your developers to continue using their Oracle PL/SQL skills and not learn
an entirely new language.
• Time-saving function packages written in Oracle can be brought over to EDB Postgres for use
with new or migrated applications preventing additional code rewrites.
• Oracle views of database objects allow DBAs to inspect and analyze their EDB Postgres
databases the same way they did with Oracle without learning completely new names and
techniques.
• Compatible versions of important everyday tools like SQL*Plus and SQL*Loader are available in
EDB Postgres so staff become productive immediately.
• A Replication tool, XA support, Database Links, and Data Adapters ensure minimal time is
required to integrate EDB Postgres applications into existing Oracle environments.

The last long-term additional saving comes in the form of reduced operational costs. A common
argument made by traditional database vendors against open source-based alternatives is that, while
initial acquisition costs may be lower, the ongoing annual operational costs will be much higher. EDB’s
customers have found that just the opposite is true.
In an IDC research paper investigating the ROI of using EDB Postgres, by interviewing EDB customers,
IDC found that EDB customers enjoyed an average of 42% reduction in their three-year cost of
operations. The result was a composite analysis across multiple organizations of different sizes and
across different industries (e.g., Natural Resources, Transportation, Communications, Financial Services,
Professional Services, Education). The cost of operations were categorized as IT staff time spent
deploying and configuring databases as well as the time spent maintaining and administering them.
THREE-YEAR COST OF OPERATIONS PER DATABASE
To quote one organization participating in the analysis:
“The administration around EnterpriseDB as compared to the other database is relatively low. We didn’t
expect this and calculated in that we would have to invest more time in administrating the database, but
that was not true. It’s even less...I think what’s important is that Postgres is less complex than some other
database management systems.”
In the same research paper, EDB Postgres users attributed additional operational savings to Risk
Mitigation: User Productivity Benefits, Business Productivity Benefits, IT Infrastructure Cost Reductions
and IT Staff Productivity Benefits. For a more detailed look at the data and analysis on savings
attributable to using EDB Postgres and customer comments, download the white paper: The Economic
and Business Advantages of EnterpriseDB Postgres Database Solutions.

REDUCING THE RISKS
OF ADOPTION
While cost savings are a key driver for moving off Oracle, achieving those savings is not without risk.
As noted in the previous section EDB makes a special effort to to reduce the technical, re-training and
integration risks of deploying EDB Postgres in an Oracle environment by developing compatible software
and tools.
For more details on exactly how database compatibility is achieved, view this 12 minute video titled:
Database Compatibility for Oracle® Explained.
However, while compatible software is necessary, it is not sufficient to ensure success. The software must
also be adopted in a proven and efficient way that introduces change while minimizing risk, maximizing
savings, and clearly demonstrating the benefits being pursued. Many factors must be accounted for in
the adoption process, not the least of which are:
• Application Profile
• Risk
• Time
• Effort
• Benefits
• Savings
EDB has years of experience helping customers navigate the waters of Postgres adoption. The following
table shows a multi-customer composite of a prototypical EDB Postgres adoption roadmap.
