## Expected Behavior
As a user who is navigating the react-router enabled site using the keyboard,
I have made my way to a Tabs component, and it is displaying keyboard focus
properly. To select the focused tab, I hit space bar, and react-router updates
my view to the corresponding component.
## Current Behavior
When selecting the keyboard focused tab by hitting spacebar, a javascript
error is thrown from Material UI.
    ButtonBase.js:149 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'start' of null
