### Issue Description
I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
As a user navigating a React-Router-enabled site using the keyboard, I should be able to:
1. Navigate to a `Tabs` component.
2. See the keyboard focus properly displayed on one of the tabs.
3. Select the focused tab by pressing the space bar, which should update the view to the corresponding component.

## Current Behavior
When selecting the keyboard-focused tab by pressing the space bar, a JavaScript error is thrown from Material-UI. The error message is as follows:

```
ButtonBase.js:149 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'start' of null
    at TouchRipple. (ButtonBase.js:149)

    at HTMLUnknownElement.callCallback (react-dom.development.js:1299)
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Press the Tab key until the keyboard focus is on the "Bar" item.
2. Press the space bar.
3. Observe the JavaScript error.
