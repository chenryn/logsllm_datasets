The SciPy documentation site does not load securely (in Google Chrome) due to
mixed content (HTTPS vs HTTP). This seems to have been resolved in the Sphinx
repo in this commit and in the SciPy Sphinx Theme repo in this commit.
However, it doesn't appear that the doc site has been updated with these
changes.

I couldn't find another issue with this, but if I overlooked it, feel free to
refer me to the duplicate. Thanks.
