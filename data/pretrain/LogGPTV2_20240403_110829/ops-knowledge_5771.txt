User:  Please guide how to use Git for source code version control, and explain what Git's basic operations (such as add, commit, push, etc.) do.
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system that can be used to manage source code during software development. The following are the basic operations and functions of Git: 1. Initialize the warehouse Use the "git init" command to create a new Git warehouse locally. 2. Add files Use the "git add" command to add files to be tracked to the Git index. 3. Commit changes Use the "git commit" command to submit the files that have been added to the Git index and the changes made to the local repository. 4. View the status Use the "git status" command to view the status of the files in the current warehouse. 5. View differences Use the "git diff" command to view the differences between the files in the current working directory and the last committed version. 6. Undo changes Use the "git checkout" command to roll back to the last submitted state or delete local uncommitted files. 7. Remote warehouse operation Use the "git remote" command to add the remote warehouse address, the "git push" command to push the local code to the remote warehouse, and the "git pull" command to pull the code from the remote warehouse to the local. In short, Git allows developers to manage and maintain code more efficiently, thereby ensuring the quality and stability of the code.
