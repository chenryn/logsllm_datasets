User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 insert_large_data 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks whether a query related table has a large number of inserted tuples. If the number of inserted tuples is greater than or equal to the specified threshold (stored in the variable "inserted_tuples_threshold"), it is considered a root cause. The function then calculates the ratio of inserted tuples to live tuples and provides a suggestion to make adjustments to the business. If the number of inserted tuples is less than the threshold, the function checks for insert operators and if any of them have a large number of rows inserted (greater than the threshold), it is considered a root cause and a suggestion is provided. If neither of these conditions are met, it is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- n_tuples_inserted
- inserted_tuples_threshold
- live_tuples
- table_structure
- plan_parse_info
- rows
