Thank you for your feedback in issue #5185 ðŸŒ¹. It would be greatly appreciated if we could add autocomplete support for string literals in the following scenario:

```typescript
type Foo = "aReallyLong" | "bReallyLong";
let foo: Foo;
foo = "aReallyLong"; // Enable autocomplete for this line
```

This request is related to issue #5554 (comment).

Thank you for your consideration.
