    The deadline support in lookupIPDeadline is apparently not a real deadline, in the sense
    that a goroutine is leaking on every lookup that does not return timely.
    I have a bug report for mgo where someone got to 50k+ goroutines hanging on it:
    https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MGO-41
    I'll have to do something else as I need to support existing releases, but it'd be good
    to get this fixed so that deadlines are real, at some point.
