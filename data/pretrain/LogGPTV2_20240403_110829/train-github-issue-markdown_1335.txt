The `lookupIPDeadline` function does not appear to enforce a true deadline. Specifically, if a lookup does not complete in a timely manner, it results in a goroutine leak. I encountered a bug report for the mgo package where a user experienced over 50,000 goroutines hanging due to this issue: [MGO-41](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MGO-41).

While I will need to implement a workaround to support existing releases, it would be beneficial to address this problem and ensure that deadlines are properly enforced in the future.
