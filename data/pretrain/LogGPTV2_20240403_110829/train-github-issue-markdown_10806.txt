Subject: Issue with Tooltip Positioning and Link Functionality After BS3 Upgrade

Hello,

Since upgrading to Bootstrap 3 (BS3), I have encountered the following problem:

I have a vertical menu consisting of five links, each stacked one below the other. Each link has a tooltip positioned at the top. 

After the upgrade, when I hover over the links in Firefox, the tooltips appear in random positions. This issue is specific to Firefox, as it does not occur in Chrome. The console in Firefox displays the following error:
```
TypeError: this.remove is not a function
```
This error is generated by jQuery (version 1.9.1).

Additionally, the links no longer function properly. I suspect that the tooltips may be overlapping the links, preventing them from being clickable.

As a temporary workaround, I changed the tooltip placement to the right, which resolved the issue with the links. However, the console errors persist.

Could you please investigate this issue?

Thank you,
