Hello,
Since the upgrade to BS3 I have the following problem:
I have a vertical menu with 5 links one below the other. Each link has a
tooltip with position - top.
After the upgrade to BS3, rolling over the links makes the tooltips to appear
randomly in firefox (and only there, chrome works fine). Error in console is :
'TypeError: this.remove is not a function' and is given by JQuery (v 1.9.1).
Moreover, the links dont work anymore (since I guess the tooltip is above them
somehow).
Eventually, I had to move the tooltips with placement - right and the links
worked again (but the console errors remain).
Can you please check this up?
