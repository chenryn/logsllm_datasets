User: I have some independent tasks which I am currently putting into different/independent workers.
To be understood easily I will walk you through an example. Let's say I have three independent tasks namely sleep, eat, smile. A task may need to work under different celery configurations. So, I think, it is better to separate each of these tasks into different directories with different workers. Some tasks may be required to work on different servers.
I am planning add some more tasks in the future and each of them will be implemented by different developers. 
Providing these conditions, there are more than one workers associated to each individual task.
Now, here is the problem and my question. 
When I start three smile tasks, one of these will be fetched by smile's worker and carried out. But the next task will be fetched from eat's worker and never will be carried out.
So, what is the accepted, most common pattern? Should I send each tasks into different queues and workers should listen its own queue?
Assistant: In a similar setup, I decided to go with specific queues for different tasks, and then I can decide which worker listens on which queue (which can also be changed dynamically !).
