OVERVIEW OF ESA CONSTRUCTIONS
We recall some common ESA constructions based on both
STE and ORAM.
Baseline (BSL). Let Σmm = (Setup, Get) be a
response-revealing multi-map encryption scheme and SKE =
(Gen, Enc, Dec) be a symmetric-key encryption scheme. Con-
sider the ESA scheme BSL = (Setup, Search) where each
algorithm works as follows:
• BSL.Setup(1k, D): it builds a multi-map MM that maps
each keyword w ∈ W to the tuple D(w). It then computes
(K1, EMM) ← Σmm.Setup(1k, MM) and, for all i ∈ [n],
cti ← Enc(K2, Di), where K2 ← SKE.Gen(1k). It
outputs (K, ED), where K = (K1, K2) and ED =
(EMM, ct1, . . . , ctn).
the parties execute (⊥; I) ←
Σmm.Get(K1, w; EMM) after which the server returns
(cti)i∈I to the client. For all i ∈ I, the client computes
Di := SKE.Dec(K2, cti).
• BSL.Search(cid:0)K, w; ED(cid:1):
If the multi-map encryption scheme Σmm is instantiated
with any of the standard constructions [19], [18], [17], [10],
[11], [3], the SSE scheme will have leakage proﬁle
and its search and communication complexity will be
O
#D(w) +
which is optimal.
D∈D(w)
Opaque (OPQ). As far as we know,
the construc-
tion we now describe has not appeared in prior work. It
has a relatively low leakage proﬁle and optimal search and
communication complexity at the cost of additional storage.
Let Σmm = (Setup, Get) be a response-hiding multi-map
encryption scheme and let SKE = (Gen, Enc, Dec) be a
symmetric-key encryption scheme. Consider the structured
ESA scheme OPQ = (Setup, Search) where each algorithm
works as follows:
• OPQ.Setup(1k, D): it builds a multi-map MM that maps
each keyword w ∈ W to a tuple t = (t1,··· , ta/B)
composed of B-sized blocks, where ti is the ith block of
Its storage complexity will be
ΛBSL =(cid:0)(cid:63),(cid:0)qeq, rid, vol(cid:1)(cid:1).
