### Internet Filtering and Surveillance Solutions

A variety of internet filtering and surveillance products, such as DansGuardian, Fortinet, Internet Sheriff, K9, N2H2, Naomi, Net Nanny, SmartFilter, squidGuard, Surf Control, We-Blocker, and Websense, are available for both educational and governmental use. These tools can be configured to suit the needs of a classroom or an entire nation. By default, they filter out common vices like pornography and gambling. While these companies often face criticism from privacy advocates, from a free market perspective, their software is politically neutral.

**Example: DansGuardian**

DansGuardian, an open-source tool, exemplifies the sophistication and flexibility of such software. It is marketed as a free, advanced internet filtering solution that aims to create "a cleaner, safer place for you and your children." The software's settings range from "unobtrusive" to "draconian," allowing for granular control over content. Features include filtering by URL, IP, domain, user, content, file extension, and POST. Advanced capabilities encompass PICS labeling, MIME type, regular expressions, HTTPS, ad blocking, compressed HTML, intelligent algorithm matches for phrases in mixed HTML/whitespace, and phrase-weighting to minimize over- and under-blocking. Additionally, it offers a whitelist mode and a stealth mode, where access is granted to users while alerts are sent to administrators.

### Outlook on Cyber Governance

The internet, while transformative, also presents significant challenges. The primary goals of a cyber governance office should be to monitor all network traffic within the country and ensure that political messages originate only from authorized sources. Simultaneously, we must deny adversaries similar opportunities. Each citizen will have a unique internet address, and with full control over national telecommunications, we can dictate who sees what information. Censoring the internet is just the beginning; in the future, we could manipulate the so-called "truth" in cyberspace. This could involve copying and altering websites of adversaries and reposting them, or running cyber sting operations to expose dissenters. The average user, lacking deep technical knowledge, will either trust or distrust the information they see, but either way, we maintain control.

### Exodus Non-Governmental Organization Survey: The Most Repressive Governments in Cyberspace

This Top Ten list, compiled using data from organizations such as Reporters Without Borders, the OpenNet Initiative, Freedom House, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the ITU Digital Access Index, and the Central Intelligence Agency, evaluates the level of internet repression and surveillance globally. For example, RSF assesses each country based on factors like murders, imprisonment, harassment of cyber-dissidents, censorship of news sites, and the availability of independent ISPs. The task of evaluating human rights and surveillance is ongoing, and we welcome corrections to any errors in fact or judgment.

#### #10 Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe once had one of the best telecommunications systems in Africa, but it has deteriorated significantly. Internet access is available in Harare and planned for other major towns. The government aims to control all gateways, having purchased an internet monitoring system from China and working towards a monopoly for the state-owned Tel*One. Legislation, such as the Interception of Communications Bill, mandates ISPs to support government monitoring, with no legal recourse for citizens. In October 2006, the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) met to infiltrate ISPs and identify journalists spreading "negative information" about the government. Jail terms for such offenses can be up to 20 years.

#### #09 Iran

Iran's internet usage is growing rapidly, with 10 million users in 2006 and a projected 25 million by 2009. Despite sophisticated surveillance, many strict rules are not routinely enforced. Cyber cafés and broadband usage are increasing. Former President Ali Mohammad Khatami stated that the government aims for minimal control, emphasizing Muslim values but only censoring truly insulting content. However, the OpenNet Initiative reports that about one-third of all websites are blocked, including political, pornographic, and blogging sites. Accessing non-Islamic sites is illegal, and media outlets receive weekly lists of banned subjects. Despite this, Iranian internet users are savvy, with significant participation in blogging and alternative media.

#### #08 Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia's telecommunications system is highly developed, and its citizens have been using the internet since 1994. The government seeks to create a "moral" internet by requiring ISPs to adhere to Muslim values. KACST, the central proxy server, uses cached sites, banned URLs, and cyber-triage to monitor traffic. Encryption is forbidden, and citizens often use international access to bypass restrictions. Censorship is evident through pop-up warnings, and officials claim to block all major porn sites. However, there is evidence of political censorship, with unofficial histories and opposition sites being targeted. Citizens can appeal blocks through a Blacklist Removal form, with KACST receiving over 500 forms daily.

#### #07 Eritrea

Eritrea's oral traditions remain strong, and radio plays a crucial role in both government and anti-government communications. The political battle is now shifting to the internet, with local factions reaching regional and international audiences. Eritrea went online in November 2000, with four ISPs sharing a single national pipe. By 2005, the number of internet users had grown to 70,000. Initially, internet access was unimpeded, but since 2001, human rights have declined, and all cyber cafés were transferred to "educational and research" centers in 2004, ostensibly to combat pornography.

#### #06 Belarus

In Belarus, the Presidential Administration controls all information channels, including the internet. Beltelecom, the state-owned monopoly, provides telephone and internet connectivity, with about 30 ISPs connecting through it. The only reported independent link is through the academic network BasNet. Beltelecom is accused of "persecution by permit" and requiring political loyalty for services.
