DansGuardian, Fortinet, Internet Sheriff, K9, N2H2, Naomi, Net Nanny, 
SmartFilter, squidGuard, Surf Control, We-Blocker, Websense, and more.  
These products can be configured for either a schoolroom or a nation-
state.  Default filters include common vices like pornography and 
gambling.  These companies are often the focus of privacy advocates' 
criticism, but from a free market standpoint, there is a logical 
defense: filtering software is politically neutral. 
A good example of such software is the open source tool DansGuardian.  
It is advertised as sophisticated, free Internet surveillance, and “a 
cleaner, safer, place for you and your children”.  Its settings can be 
configured from “unobstructive” to “draconian”.  With this software, 
the Cyber Office can filter by technical specifications such as URL, 
IP, domain, user, content, file extension, and POST.  Advanced 
features include PICS labeling, MIME type, regular expressions, https, 
adverts, compressed HTML, intelligent algorithm matches for phrases in 
mixed HTML/whitespace, and phrase-weighting, which is intended to 
reduce over- and under-blocking.  Furthermore, there is a whitelist 
mode, and stealth mode, where access is granted to the user but an 
alert is nonetheless sent to administrators. 
Outlook 
The Internet itself is a Trojan horse that we cannot trust.  The Cyber 
Office’s primary goals will be to have visibility on all network 
traffic within the country, and to ensure that all political messages 
come only from you.  At the same time, we will deny your adversaries 
the same opportunities.  All citizens will have an Internet address 
that can be associated with them personally.  Because we own all 
national telecommunications, we therefore own the entire 
infrastructure, and can decide precisely who sees what information.  
And censoring the Internet is only the beginning.  In the future, it 
will even be possible to manipulate the so-called “truth” in 
cyberspace.  We intend to copy the websites of our adversaries, change 
the information they contain, and repost them in our country.  And we 
can run cyber sting operations that are designed solely to bring 
cockroaches out of the woodwork.  The average user knows very little 
about these matters, and he will either have to trust the information 
he sees, or not to trust it.  Either way, we win.
Exodus Non-Governmental Organization Survey 
The Most Repressive Governments in Cyberspace 
This Top Ten list has been compiled using information and analysis provided by, among others, 
Reporters Without Borders (www.rsf.org/), the OpenNet Initiative (opennet.net/), Freedom House 
(www.freedomhouse.org/), Electronic Frontier Foundation (www.eff.org/), ITU Digital Access 
Index (www.itu.int), Central Intelligence Agency (www.cia.gov), and subjective analysis of 
current events.  By way of example, the RSF website states that the “[a]ssessment of the situation 
in each country (good, middling, difficult, serious) is based on murders, imprisonment or 
harassment of cyber-dissidents or journalists, censorship of news sites, existence of independent 
news sites, existence of independent ISPs and deliberately high connection charges.”  The 
evaluation of human rights and/or Big Brother-style cyber surveillance across the planet will be a 
never-ending task.  Further, the well of ignorance and misunderstanding will always be too deep 
for this to be a conclusive report.  Therefore, we are constantly on the lookout for corrections to 
errors in both fact and judgment.  That said, here are the current Exodus Top Ten: 
# 10  Zimbabwe 
Telecommunications in Zim were among the best in Africa, but like everything else in the 
country – as the government desperately clings to power – have gone downhill precipitously.  
Internet connection is available in Harare and is planned for all major towns and for some of the 
smaller ones.  There are two international digital gateway exchanges, in Harare and in Gweru. 
One of the primary government strategies appears to try to own the gateways leading into and out 
of the country.  The government has purchased an Internet monitoring system from China, and is 
working toward a monopoly solution for the state-owned Tel*One telecoms firm.  The goal here 
is two-fold: to force all communications through one pipe, for the sake of total visibility on 
internal and external traffic, and to increase the cash flow into quasi-government coffers. 
Legislation, including the Interception of Communications Bill (ICB), forces ISPs, some of 
which have threatened to shut down in protest, to spend their Zim dollars on hardware and 
software to support the government's monitoring programs.  In country, there are no court 
challenges to government intercepts allowed. 
In October, 2006, it was reported that President Robert Mugabe's Central Intelligence 
Organisation (CIO) met with the purpose of infiltrating Zim Internet service providers (ISP), in 
order to “flush out” journalists who were using the Internet to feed “negative information” about 
the government to international media.  According to the report, police were informed that they 
should to pose as cyber café attendants and Web surfers.  However, they were also told that it 
would be necessary for them to undergo “some computer training” first. 
A police spokesman announced that the government would do “all it can” to prevent citizens 
from writing “falsehoods against the government.”  Jail terms for such offenses are up to 20 years 
in length. 
# 09  Iran 
Life on the Iranian Net is already vibrant, and growing at a dizzying speed.  There were 1M 
Internet users in 2001, 10M today, and there could be 25M in 2009.  The expansion has been 
phenomenal, especially regarding the posting of Farsi-language material online.  Cyber cafés and 
the use of broadband are rising sharply. 
While Internet surveillance in Iran is reported to be among the most sophisticated in the world, 
the country’s political culture is also the most advanced in our Top Ten list, and many of the 
strict rules regarding Internet usage do not appear to be routinely enforced.  Cyber café 
monitoring is reported to be only the occasional inspector, and while journalists are required to be 
free of “moral corruption” – and anonymous publications of any sort are officially prohibited – 
some news media are openly critical of the government, and the Web is the “most trusted” news 
source. 
Former president Ali Mohammad Khatami stated in an interview that the Iranian government 
tries to have the “minimum necessary” control over the Internet.  He explained that while Muslim 
values would be emphasized within Iranian network space, only sites that are “truly insulting” 
towards religious values would be censored.  He argued that political sites which oppose official 
Iranian government viewpoints were available to the public. 
According to the OpenNet Initiative, however, about one-third of all websites are blocked by the 
Iranian government.  Among the frequently blocked sites were politics (Voice of America 
www.voanews.com), 
pornography, 
translation, 
blogging 
(www.movabletype.org), 
and 
anonymizing software.  Similar content is more likely to be blocked if in Farsi.  Commercial 
software known to have been used in Iran is SmartFilter by Secure Computing. 
Furthermore, it is technically illegal to access “non-Islamic” Internet sites, and such offenses can 
elicit severe punishments.  Media receive a list of banned subjects each week, ISPs must install 
mechanisms to filter Web and e-mail content, and there is a dedicated press court.  Iranian 
publications are not to conflict with government goals.  Since 2000, 110 news outlets are reported 
to have been closed, and over 40 journalists detained. 
While it has been reported that Iran has engaged in widespread censorship, it has also been 
alleged that the government is attempting to control user behavior to a far lesser degree.  In fact, 
Iranian Internet users are Net savvy.  Since the year 2000, Iranian citizens have participated in a 
remarkable amount of mainstream and alternative blogging.  Even President Mahmud 
Ahmadinejad’s has one: http://www.ahmadinejad.ir/.  On the downside, at least one death threat 
was lodged against blogger Hoder (Hossein Derakhshan), and hard-line newspaper Kayhan 
accused the CIA of using Iranian blogs to undermine Iranian government. 
On the bright side, there is significant movement inside the country limit the power of the 
government in cyberspace.  In August 2004, a number of reformist news sites were blocked, but 
the content was quickly mirrored on other domains.  In other case, an anonymous system 
administrator posted an alleged official blacklist of banned sites.  Even some reformist Iranian 
legislators have openly complained about censorship, even online.  One current trend among the 
population is a rise in Real Simple Syndication (RSS) to evade blocking. 
# 08  Saudi Arabia 
The telecommunications system in Saudi is first-rate, encompassing extensive microwave radio 
relay, coaxial cable, and submarine fiber-optic cable systems.  Like Iran, Saudi Arabia boasts a 
highly educated citizenry; they have been surfing the Internet since 1994. 
Government authorities in Riyadh have articulated that they seek to create a “moral” Internet 
through the elimination of its “negative” aspects.  The primary strategy has been to require ISPs 
to conform to Muslim values, traditions, and culture in order to obtain an operating license.  
Upstream, the King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) represents a single, 
centralized international connection from Saudi Arabia to the outside world.  KACST is a 
national-level proxy server uses a complicated system of cached sites, banned URLs and cyber-
triage to keep an eye on inbound and outbound traffic.  Encryption is forbidden.  Still, Saudi 
officials have admitted that in the race between technology and bureaucracy, they struggle to 
keep up.  Citizens commonly use international telephone and satellite access to foreign ISPs.  
To the Saudi Web surfer, censorship appears in the form of a pop-up window, warning that the 
content they seek has been disallowed (in Arabic and in English) and that their request for said 
information was logged by government servers (in Arabic only).  Officials insist that they are 
reasonable when it comes to blocking Internet sites.  Included in the range of information that 
OpenNet Initiative researchers have seen withheld are religion, health, education, humor, 
entertainment, general reference works, computer hacking, and political activism.  In Saudi 
Arabia, pornography is the first thing to go.  Officials contend that “all” major porn sites are 
identified and blocked. 
However, there is evidence that censorship is based on a strong mix of morality and politics.  As 
in the book 1984, “unofficial” histories of the Saudi Arabia are banned.  Officially, political sites 
are not supposed to be blocked, but a well-known cat-and-mouse game between Riyadh and an 
anti-government group called (MIRA) tells otherwise.  Initially, the government tried to block the 
site by IP.  The site’s owners were forced into marathon contest of hide-and-seek via IP hopping 
and port randomization, while sending constantly changing addresses to its patrons by email.  The 
challenge was to make its readership aware of the new Web location before the authorities could 
find it.  On average, MIRA was able to stay ahead of the government for about a week at a time.  
Web application logins reportedly made it more difficult for the government to see where its 
citizens were going.  Evidently, officials decided that the effort was too much work, and finally 
give up. 
In a Web filtering system like this, which uses a primitive type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to 
evaluate Internet sites it has never seen before, the total number or percentage of banned sites and 
information cannot easily be known, but easily runs into the millions.  At its most basic level, 
keywords are used to recognize and block certain types of information.  In order to prevent 
unnecessary over-blocking, one of the unique aspects of the Saudi system is that citizens can fill 
out a Blacklist Removal form (there are also Blacklist Addition forms).  Thus, if an individual 
thinks that certain information is being withheld from them in error, they have an efficient 
appeals process.  KACST management claim that they receive over 500 forms every day. 
# 07  Eritrea 
Oral traditions in Africa are still strong, have a historical resonance, and are widely used to foster 
national solidarity.  Radio and clandestine radio stations in the Horn of Africa play a vital role in 
both government and anti-government forces.  Recently, one sole Sudanese transmitter offered 
service to three separate anti-Eritrean radio stations. 
Political battles in the Eritrea are now shifting from the radio spectrum to cyberspace.  Local 
factions, as they appeal to the hearts, minds, wallets of their supporters, are able to reach both 
regional and international audiences via the Internet.  Sites such as Pan-African News 
(www.africanews.org) and Eritrea Online (www.primenet.com/ephrem) feature images from the 
frontlines, analysis, and everyone from African leaders to humanitarian groups making daily 
statements in support of their causes. 
In November 2000, Eritrea became the last African country to go online.  Four ISPs shared one 
national pipe and 512 kilobits per second.  By 2005, the number of Internet users had grown to a 
reported 70,000.  However, since few Eritreans are wealthy enough to own a computer, ISPs 
typically offer walk-in use.  Initially, the national Telecommunications Service of Eritrea (TSE) 
announced that Internet access in the country would be unimpeded, and opposition and Ethiopian 
websites were accessible. 
Since 2001, however, human rights in Eritrea have steadily gone downhill.  There are no foreign 
correspondents in the country, and prison inmates have been confined to cells consisting of cargo 
containers.  No International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visits have been allowed.  In 
2004, all cyber cafés, previously only under government “supervision”, were physically 
transferred to “educational and research” centers.  The reason given was “pornography”, but 
international diplomats were highly skeptical of the move. 
Since that time, some ruling party members decided to post an announcement of a new political 
party to the Web, but the posting was made from outside Eritrea. 
# 06  Belarus 
Life in Minsk has not changed much since the Cold War.  The Presidential Administration 
directly controls all information flowing through the printing press, radio, television, and now 
cyberspace.  Independent stations typically avoid news programming altogether, and even 
Russian TV is heavily censored. 
The Beltelecom state-owned monopoly is the sole provider of telephone and Internet 
connectivity, although about 30 ISPs connect through Beltelecom.  The only reported 
independent link is through the academic network BasNet.  Beltelecom has been accused of 
“persecution by permit” and of requiring a demonstration of political loyalty for its services.  At
