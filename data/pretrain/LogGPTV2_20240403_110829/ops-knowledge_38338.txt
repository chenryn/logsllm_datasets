User: I'm calling a C/C++ program from python with Popen, python code should observe behavior of child process and collect some data for his own work.
Problem is that C code already uses pipes for calling some shell commands - so after my execution from python, C program cannot execute bash shell command.
Is there any way in calling from Popen to specify that, child process should execute his own pipe command in shell??? 
I tried with shell=True, but doesn't help!
Assistant: The best way is probably to use a TCP connection to localhost. If you are using a *nix, you can probably do it by opening a temporary file and polling it from the host application.
