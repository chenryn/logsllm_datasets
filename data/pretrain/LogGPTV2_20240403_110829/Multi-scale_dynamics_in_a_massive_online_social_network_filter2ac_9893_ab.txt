stream, and use them to identify structural changes in the
large Chinese social network. We monitor average degree,
average path length, average clustering coeﬃcient, and as-
sortativity. As before, the analysis of each metric starts from
November 21, 2005.
Average Degree. As shown in Figure 1(c), average node de-
gree grows for much of our observed time period, because the
creation of edges between nodes out paces the introduction
of new users to the network. When we take a closer look,
we see that around days 120, 275, 475 and 650, the average
degree grows faster. This means that more edges are created
around this time period, which happens to match up nicely
with the beginning of new academic semesters over multiple
years. On day 305, however, a period of rapid growth in
users starts to reduce average degree in the network. This
comes from a sudden inﬂux of new users due to several suc-
cessful publicity campaigns by the social network. Next, on
day 386 (December 2006), average degree drops suddenly
when 670K loosely connected nodes from a competing social
network merges with our social network. Average degree re-
sumes steady growth following the event, again showing edge
growth out pacing node growth and increasing network den-
siﬁcation [22].
Average Path Length. We follow the standard practice of
sampling nodes to make path length computation tractable
on our large social graphs. We compute the average path
length over a sample of 1000 nodes from the SCC for each
snapshot, and limit ourselves to computing the metric once
every three days. As seen in Figure 1(d), the results are
intuitive: path length drops as densiﬁcation increases (i.e.
node degree increases). There is a signiﬁcant jump when
nodes from the second online social network join the large
social network on day 386, but the slow drop resumes as
densiﬁcation continues after the merge.
Average Clustering Coeﬃcient. Clustering coeﬃcient is a
measure of local density, computed as the ratio of the exist-
ing edges between the immediate neighbors of a node over
the maximum number of edges possible between them. We
plot average clustering coeﬃcient in Figure 1(e).
In early
stages of network growth (before day 60), the network was
very small and contained a large number of small groups
with loose connections between them. Groups often formed
local cliques or near-cliques, resulting in high clustering co-
eﬃcients across the network. Once the network grows in
size, average clustering coeﬃcient transitions to a smooth
curve and decreases slowly. The network merge produces a
small jump, since the competing social network had many
small clusters of 3 or 4 nodes that boosted average clustering
coeﬃcient.
Assortativity. Finally, we plot assortativity in Figure 1(f).
Assortativity is the probability of a node to connect to other
nodes with similar degree, computed as the Pearson corre-
lation coeﬃcient of degrees of all node pairs. In the early
stages of the network, the graph is sparse and dominated
by a small number of supernodes connecting to many leaf
nodes. This produces a strong negative assortativity that
ﬂuctuates and then evens out as the network stabilizes in
structure. Assortativity evens out at around 0, meaning
nodes in our network have no discernible inclination to be
friends with nodes of similar or diﬀerent degree.
Summary. We observe that the high-level structure of
our network solidiﬁes very quickly. Several key properties
stabilize after the ﬁrst 2 months, with others establishing a
consistent trend after 100 days. While the notable network
merge with a second, competing social network introduces
signiﬁcant changes to network properties, the eﬀects quickly
fade with time and continued inﬂux of new users to the
merged network.
3. EDGE EVOLUTION
In this section, we study the behavior of individual nodes
in terms of how they build edges over time. Many studies
have shown that nodes build edges following the preferential
attachment (PA) model [5, 21, 26, 10]. Speciﬁcally, when a
new node joins the network and creates edges, it chooses the

destination of each edge proportionally to the destination’s
degree. In other words, nodes with higher degrees are more
likely to be selected as the destination of new edges, leading
to a “rich get richer” phenomenon.
Using our dynamic network data, we extend the analysis
of this model in two new dimensions. First, while PA deﬁnes
how a sequence of edges is created in logical order, we seek
to understand how node activities correlate with absolute
time. Second, we are interested in whether, as the network
evolves, the PA model’s predictive ability grows or weakens
over time.
3.1 Time Dynamics of Edge Creation
Edge Inter-arrival. We begin by analyzing the edge cre-
ation process in absolute time, focusing on the speed that
nodes add edges. First, we look at the inter-arrival time
between edge creation events. For each node, we collect the
inter-arrival times between all its edges, then place them
into buckets based on the age of the node when the edge
was created. We then aggregate all users’ data together for
each bucket, e.g.
the “Month 1” bucket contains all edge
inter-arrival times where one or both of the nodes was less
than 1 month old.
We plot the results in Figure 2(a). We observe that the
time gap between a node’s edge creation events follows a
power-law distribution. The scaling exponent is between 1.8
and 2.5, shown in Figure 2(a). The exponent values can be
used in an edge creation gap model. However, it is diﬃcult to
evaluate its signiﬁcance without a direct comparison to data
from other networks. Overall, this power-law distribution
provides a realistic model of a user’s idle time between edge
creations at diﬀerent stages of her lifetime.
Edge Creation Over Lifetime.
The above result moti-
vates us to examine the normalized activity level within each
user’s lifetime. We plot in Figure 2(b) the distribution of
new edges based on the normalized age of the users involved.
To avoid statistical outliers, we consider only nodes with at
least 30 days of history in our dataset and degree of at least
20. As expected, users create most of their friendships early
on in their lifetimes. Edge creation converges to a constant
rate once most oﬄine friends have been found and linked.
Node Age and Edge Creation.
We observe above that
nodes tend to generate a signiﬁcant portion of their edges
soon after joining the network. Since most generative graph
models use new nodes to drive edge creation, we ask the
question “What portion of the new edges created in the net-
work are driven by the arrival of new nodes?” For each day
in our dataset, we take each edge created on that day and
determine its minimal age, i.e. the minimum age of its two
endpoints. The distribution of this value shows what portion
of new edges are created by new nodes.
We compute and plot this distribution in Figure 2(c). We
show the relative contribution by nodes of diﬀerent ages by
plotting three stacked percentages, showing the portion of
daily new edges with minimal age ≤ 1 day, ≤ 10 days, and ≤
30 days. We see that when the network is young (≤ 60 days),
the vast majority of new edges connect brand new nodes (i.e.
1 day old). As the network stabilizes and matures, that
portion quickly drops, and continues to decrease over time.
Edges with minimal age of 10-30 days dominate new edges
for much of our trace, but their contribution steadily drops
over time from 95% around day 100 to 48% by day 770. Note
that this drop occurs even after the daily relative network
growth has reached a constant level (see Figure 1(b)). It is
reasonable to assume that in today’s network (4.5 years past
the end of our data), the vast majority of new edges connect
mature users who have been in the network for signiﬁcant
amounts of time.
This result in Figure 2(c) is important, because it shows
a dramatic change in the driving force behind edge creation
as the network matures. Most generative graph models as-
sume edge creation is driven by new nodes. However, our
data indicates that existing models will only accurately cap-
ture the early stages of network creation. Capturing the
continuous evolution of a mature network requires a model
that not only recognizes the contribution of mature nodes
in edge creation, but also its continuous change over time.
3.2 Strength of Preferential Attachment
Next, we take a look at the preferential attachment model
and how well it predicts changes over time and network
growth. We follow the method in [21] to measure the
strength (or degree) of preferential attachment using edge
probability pe(d). This function deﬁnes the probability that
an edge chooses its destination with degree d, normalized by
the total number of nodes of degree d before this time step:
pe(d) =
Σt{et(u, v) ∧ dt−1(v) = d}
Σt|v : dt−1(v) = d|

where {et(u, v) ∧ dt−1(v) = d} = 1 if the destination v of
the edge et(u, v) is of degree d, and 0 otherwise.
Intuitively, if a network grows following the PA model, its
edge probability pe(d) should have a linear relationship with
d: pe(d) ∝ d. The authors of [21] veriﬁed this conclusion
using synthetic graphs, and also tested the PA model on
four real social networks: Flickr, Delicious, Answers, and
LinkedIn. The ﬁrst three networks follow the PA model
pe(d) ∝ dα with α ≈ 1, while for LinkedIn, α = 0.6. From
these observations, we can deﬁne a criterion for detecting
preferential attachment: when α → 1, the network grows
