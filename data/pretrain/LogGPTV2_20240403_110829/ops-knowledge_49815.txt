User:  company needs to build a real-time monitoring system that can monitor server running status, business data, etc., and provide a feasible solution.
Assistant: In order to build a real-time monitoring system, the following are feasible solutions: 1. Select the appropriate monitoring tool: First, you need to choose a monitoring tool that suits the company's needs. Common monitoring tools include Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, etc. These tools are scalable and large-scale deployment capabilities, and support multiple protocols and data sources. 2. Determine the source of monitoring data: System monitoring needs to collect various data sources, such as logs, performance statistics, network traffic, etc. Therefore, key metrics, log locations, and other important data need to be identified to ensure complete analysis and collection of monitoring data. 3. Set monitoring roles and permissions: Limited permissions should be set to control which data and settings each user or system administrator can access. By empowering system administrators, flexibility and scalability in the monitoring system can be controlled. 4. Choose cloud monitoring or local deployment: There are two common monitoring models: cloud monitoring and local deployment. Cloud monitoring can reduce the burden and cost of IT, while local deployment is more secure and controllable. 5. Visual monitoring data: Visualize monitoring data so that managers can quickly analyze and grasp the status of key business information. Some common data visualization tools include Grafana, Kibana, Tableau, etc. After the above steps are determined, the monitoring system can be deployed as required. At this point, a real-time monitoring system can play a role in detailed monitoring of server running status, business data, etc.
