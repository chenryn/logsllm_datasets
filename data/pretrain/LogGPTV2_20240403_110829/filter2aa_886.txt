Silent Banker author forgets to seed the PRNG 
Honey, I Shrunk the Entropy!
Off to a bad start…
Zeus, September 2007
PRNG used to avoid hash-based detection
Silent Banker, Feburary 2008
PRNG used to generate temporary file names
Recipe for disaster - step 1
Silent Banker, July 2008
PRNG used to generate encryption key
Recipe for disaster
1.
Seed the PRNG
2.
Generate 16 byte key with 1000 calls to rand()
3.
Generate 8 byte number from 16 byte key
4.
Generate another 8 byte number from the first 8 
byte number and “secd” value from INI 
configuration file 
5.
Explode the second 8 byte number into 32 
bytes
6.
Encrypt stolen data with original 16 byte key 
from step 2 
7.
Send the exploded 32 byte number along with 
stolen data
Recipe to exploit the disaster
1.
Seed the PRNG TO ZERO
2.
Generate 16 byte key with 1000 calls to rand()
3.
Generate 8 byte number from 16 byte key
4.
Generate another 8 byte number from the first 8 
byte number and “secd” value from INI 
configuration file 
5.
Explode the second 8 byte number into 32 
bytes
6.
Encrypt stolen data with original 16 byte key 
from step 2 
7.
Send the exploded 32 byte number along with 
stolen data
Disaster recovery
The one that got away…
Torpig installs MBR rootkit to get a DLL 
Injected into user-mode programs
I created a hyper cool MBR 
rootkit and all I got was this 
old trojan DLL
The nasty side
The funny side
The nice side
Attacker’s trojan defaults to xor
due to invalid size DES key
To DES or not to DES?
Always make backups!
xor backup method
How to shoot yourself in the foot
MSDN to the rescue 
Conficker.B’s flawed IP generator only 
scans a portion of the Internet
Honey, sorry to bother you 
again, I shrunk the Internet
The flawed method
What’s the big deal?
1.
Excludes multicast, private, broadcast, etc
2.
Excludes IPs on blacklisted subnets (researcher and A/V networks)
3.
Excludes any IP with an octet set to 255
4.
Excludes any IP with a last octet set to 0
5.
Excludes any IP with a 1 in the upper bit of octets 2 and 4
Simulating the flawed method
A/V vendors miss detection of $10m trojan
for 15 months because of NOOPS
Baffled by the NOOP
Neosploit screws everyone
Thanks for the cash, now 
we’re going to dash
Laqma arbitrary file upload
PHP 
cookies…mmmm…cookies
Coreflood authors re-invent 
“location dependent encryption”
You did what with what?
Location dependent encryption ;-)
