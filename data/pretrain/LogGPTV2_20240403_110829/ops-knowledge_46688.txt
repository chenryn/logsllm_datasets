Question: A developer is reviewing a C/C++ code snippet for potential security and maintenance issues. Identify the issue present in the following code:

#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

What should the developer do to improve the code quality?
"A": "Replace both instances with #include <sys/waitpid.h> for better process control.",
"B": "Remove one of the #include <sys/wait.h> directives as it is redundant.",
