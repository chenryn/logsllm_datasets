ATT&CK ID:M1015
ATT&CK Technique Name:Active Directory Configuration
Ensure certificate authorities (CA) are properly secured, including treating CA servers (and other resources hosting CA certificates) as tier 0 assets. Harden abusable CA settings and attributes.For example, consider disabling the usage of AD CS certificate SANs within relevant authentication protocol settings to enforce strict user mappings and prevent certificates from authenticating as other identifies.[4] Also consider enforcing CA Certificate Manager approval for the templates that include SAN as an issuance requirement.
