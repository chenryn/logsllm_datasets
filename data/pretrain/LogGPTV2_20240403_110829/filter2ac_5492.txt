**ATT&CK ID:** T1007  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** System Service Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to gather information about registered local system services. This can be accomplished using various tools and operating system utility commands, such as `sc query`, `tasklist /svc`, `systemctl --type=service`, and `net start`. These commands provide detailed information about the services running on the system, which can help adversaries identify potential targets for further exploitation or understand the system's configuration.
