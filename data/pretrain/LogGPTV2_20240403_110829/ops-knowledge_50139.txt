User: I am looking for an approach / design through which i want to automate the process of FTP from windows location to IFS location present on AS400 environment when ever there is a new file added to windows path. 
Below is the approach I thought, Please refine it if needed.

We have an option WRKJOBSCDEthrough which we can run a CL program in a     scheduled threshold of 1hr.
To write a CL program which invokes a script(pyton/shell) to talk to windows location(say X:drive having its IP as xx.xxx.xx.xx).
Shell script has to search for latest file in the location X:drive and FTP that jar(of size 5mb max) to IFS location(say /usr/dta/ydrive) on AS400 machine.
Thus, CL program we invoked in STEP2 has to mail to me using SNDDSTthe list of all the jars ftp'd by the scheduler job that runs every 1 hr in STEP1.



All I am new to CL programming/RPGLE . Please help me with some
  learning stuff and also design of such concepts.
Assistant: The CL command RUNRMTCMD can be used to invoke a command on a PC running a rexec() client.  iSeries Access for Windows offers such a client, and there are others available.  With the iSeries client, the output of the PC command is placed in a spool file on the AS/400, which should contain the results of the FTP session.
You can copy the spool file to a file using the CPYSPLF command and SNDDST it to yourself, but I am not sure the contents will be converted from EBCDIC to ASCII.
Check out Easy400.net for the MMAIL programs developed by Giovanni Perotti.  This package includes an EMAILSPL command to email a spool file.  I believe you will need to pay $50 for the download.
I think you are on the right track, but the are a lot of details.
