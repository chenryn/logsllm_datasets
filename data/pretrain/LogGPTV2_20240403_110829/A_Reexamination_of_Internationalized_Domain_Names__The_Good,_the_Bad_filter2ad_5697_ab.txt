### Overview of IDN Characteristics and Analysis

#### Introduction
The dataset contains 6,241 Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), representing 0.42% of the total, as detailed in Table I. Most of these malicious IDNs are registered under normal generic top-level domains (gTLDs), with only 152 IDNs under internationalized TLDs (iTLDs).

#### Data Collection and Analysis
- **Alexa Top Sites**: Attackers often target well-known brand domains, such as `apple.com`. In this study, we selected the top 1,000 second-level domains (SLDs) based on Alexa website rankings to identify potential victims of IDN abuse.
- **SSL Certificates**: We collected SSL certificates associated with IDNs to evaluate the implementation of security practices, such as traffic encryption. This was done using OpenSSL to connect to port 443 of remote hosts and fetch the certificate chains. The validity of all certificates was also checked. For comparison, we collected SSL certificates from a sample of 1.2 million non-IDNs.

#### Limitations of the Data
- **Third-Level or Deeper Unicode Characters**: Our IDN list does not include domains with Unicode characters at the third level or deeper due to limitations in zone files. Previous studies indicate that such cases account for only 6.05% of observed IDNs, so the impact on our results is minimal.
- **Country-Code TLDs (ccTLDs)**: We did not collect IDNs under ccTLDs because most zone files are kept private by their registries. Including a subset of ccTLDs could introduce bias related to registrants' language and geographic location. For example, almost all IDNs under the `.cn` ccTLD contain Chinese characters.
- **Blacklist Accuracy**: False positives and false negatives are inherent in the blacklists used. Manual analysis suggests that false positives are rare, but false negatives are more common, as many IDNs may not have been encountered by security companies. To address this, we used an in-house detector based on visual resemblance to identify new malicious IDNs and augment the blacklisted ones.

### IDN Characteristics

#### Language Distribution
- **Introduction**: IDNs enable domain names to include characters from languages other than English. Despite the growing number of IDNs (over 1.4 million listed by surveyed TLDs), only a small proportion are in active use. This highlights both the benefits and challenges, including new attack vectors like homograph attacks.
- **Language Analysis**: We used LangID, a tool that predicts the most likely language of each IDN with high accuracy (ranging from 0.904 to 0.992). Our findings show that over 75% of IDNs are registered in East Asian languages, particularly Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai. This aligns with the promotional efforts in countries like China, Japan, and Korea, where IDNs are more attractive to Internet users.

#### Registration Characteristics
- **Total IDNs**: We identified over 1.4 million IDNs from 154 million SLDs, indicating that while non-IDNs still dominate, IDNs have significant business value.
- **Creation Dates**: 6.16% (90,708) of IDNs were created before 2008, suggesting long-term commitment from serious registrants. Figure 1 shows the creation dates, with notable spikes in 2000 and 2004, corresponding to major events in the domain community. Malicious registrations also showed spikes in 2015 and 2017, often linked to cyber-squatting.
- **Registrant Behavior**: A few registrants performed large-scale opportunistic registrations, grabbing 29,318 (4%) IDNs. These registrations often focus on specific topics like online gambling and shopping. Table III lists the top 5 registrant emails, showing that all IDNs owned by a registrant serve the same purpose.
- **Registrar Activity**: At least hundreds of registrars offer IDN registrations, with 55% of IDNs registered by the top 10 registrars. Table IV shows the most active registrars, with East Asian market-facing registrars being more prominent. For example, GMO, a Japanese company, accounts for 23% of IDNs.

#### DNS Statistics
- **Active Time and Query Volume**: IDNs generally have shorter active times compared to non-IDNs, except for malicious IDNs. For instance, 60% of `.com` IDNs stayed active for less than 100 days, compared to 40% of non-IDNs. The differences are even more pronounced under other TLDs. Figure 2 illustrates these distributions.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the current state and challenges of IDNs, highlighting the need for continued monitoring and security measures.
