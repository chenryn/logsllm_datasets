contain 6,241 IDNs (0.42%), the details shown in Table I.
Most of malicious IDNs are under normal gTLDs and only
152 IDNs are under iTLDs.
Alexa Top Sites. Attackers abusing IDNs usually target well-
known brand domains,
like apple.com. In this study, we
selected the top 1K SLDs based on Alexa website ranking
as the potential victims of IDN abuse.
SSL certiﬁcates. Finally, we collected SSL certiﬁcates as-
sociated with IDNs to study whether security practices, i.e.,
trafﬁc encryption, are followed and how they are executed.
In particular, we used OpenSSL to connect to port 443 of
remote hosts associated with IDNs and fetch the certiﬁcate
chains of IDNs. The validity of all certiﬁcates were checked
by OpenSSL as well. Similarly, we collected SSL certiﬁcates
from our sampled 1.2 million non-IDNs for comparison.
Limitations of data. Although we tried to make the study as
comprehensive as possible by using data from many sources,
there are still limitations. First, our IDN list does not contain
IDN domains with Unicode characters at 3rd level or deeper,
due to the limitation of zone ﬁles. Nevertheless, previous study
showed that IDNs of those cases only account for 6.05% of all
IDNs they observed [37]. As a result, the measurement result
would not differ signiﬁcantly. Second, we did not collect IDNs
under country-code TLDs (ccTLD) because most of the zone
ﬁles are kept private by their registries. Additionally, including
IDNs under a subset of ccTLDs could introduce bias regarding
registrants’ language and geographic location. For example,
nearly all IDNs under cn ccTLD contain Chinese characters.
Finally, false positives and false negatives are unavoidable in
the blacklists we use. Regarding false positives, their quantity
should be very small, as reﬂected from our manual analysis
on a sample of domains. False negative is a bigger issue as
many of the IDNs were not even encountered by security
companies. As such, we scanned all IDNs using an in-house
detector based on visual resemblance (elaborated in Section VI
and VII), detected many new malicious IDNs and augmented
the blacklisted IDNs.
IV. OVERVIEW OF IDN CHARACTERISTICS
The introduction of IDN enables domain names to contain
characters from languages other than English. Registration
of IDN has been growing substantially since its birth (more
than 1.4 million IDNs are currently listed by the TLDs
we surveyed), making the Internet more accessible to users
worldwide, which meets its original design purpose. However,
problems do exist. Despite the sheer volume of domains, the
fact that only a small proportion of IDNs are actually in
use implies the less value provided by them to the Internet
community than non-IDNs. Other than beneﬁts, IDN opens up
new attack surface (e.g., homograph attack) and incurs more
cost on the side of brand owners for protection. In this section,
we describe our examination of the ecosystem around IDN and
give quantitative analysis regarding each ﬁnding.
A. Language
The ﬁrst question we ask is what languages are favored by
IDN registrants. By looking into the language distribution, we
are able to learn which countries are actively promoting IDN
development, as well as attackers’ preferences. In particular,
we leveraged a tool called LangID to identify the most likely
language of each IDN [40, 41]. LangID uses a multinomial
Bayes learner trained by ﬁve language-labeled datasets to pre-
dict the probability of each language on an IDN. LangID could
achieve reasonable accuracy for this task: as demonstrated in
the prior works [40], the accuracy ranges from 0.904 to 0.992
on different datasets. In the end, we were able to identify the
language for all IDNs. Below, we describe our ﬁndings.
Finding 1. More than 75% of all IDNs are registered
in languages spoken in east Asian countries. East Asian
countries turn out to stay at the forefront of IDN promotion.

As shown in Table II, more than 75% of all IDNs are related
to Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai. Meanwhile, among
all 150 iTLDs approved by ICANN, more than 60% are in
east-Asian languages (e.g., 62 in Chinese, 9 in Japanese, 4
in Korean and 4 in Mongolian). In fact, countries including
China, Japan and Korea have launched many promotional
programs to push IDN registration [10]. Our results suggest
these efforts are well rewarded so far. Another explanation
could be that compared to western countries whose residents
are more familiar to English, IDN is more attractive to Internet
users in east Asia.
Next, we looked into the languages presented by the 6, 241
malicious IDNs labeled by blacklists. We found the distribu-
tion is similar to the overall: languages having more IDNs are
more likely to contain malicious domains. Chinese tops the
chart for both overall and malicious IDNs. By investigating
the semantic meanings of malicious IDNs in Chinese, we
found that underground business (e.g., online gambling, which
is illegal in China) is using IDN to promote their illegal
products and services. Different from homograph IDN used for
phishing, IDNs registered under this setting do not impersonate
brand domains.
B. Registration Characteristics
We identiﬁed more than 1.4 million IDNs from 154 million
SLDs. Though the ratio of IDN is still small (only 1%),
suggesting non-IDNs are dominating the domain business,
its absolute number proves the business value of this IETF
initiative. By correlating IDNs with WHOIS data, we studied
how they are distributed across registrars, registrants and
registration time windows. We report our key ﬁndings below.
Finding 2: 6.16% (90, 708) IDNs were created before
ten years. Although our
2008, registered for at
snapshots of zone ﬁles were all collected recently, a large
number of IDNs registered 10 years ago were still recorded,
suggesting there are serious registrants willing to keep IDNs
for long-term business. Figure 1 presents the creation dates
of IDNs, with malicious ones shown separately. In general,
the number of registrations rises along the timeline (similar
for malicious IDNs) but we did observe several spikes. The
least

spikes of overall registration seem to be relevant to big events
in domain community: the spike in 2000 overlaps with the
launch of IDN testbed by Verisign GRS [28] and the spike in
2004 follows the introduction of German and Latin characters
in domain names [27]. For malicious registrations, we also
found two spikes in 2015 and 2017. After inspecting the
registrants’ emails, we found the spikes were caused by cyber-
squatting by a few registrants. As an example, a registrant
under PI:EMAIL registered 126 IDNs in Chinese
in Mar. 2017, with all being related to online gambling.
Finding 3. A few registrants performed large-scale
opportunistic registrations and grabbed 29, 318 (4%) IDNs.
A registrant performing opportunistic registration grabs many
domains they believe are attractive to other buyers or can be
monetized through parking. They usually have no intention in
developing websites on top of the domains. Often, opportunis-
tic domains under one registrant are of one speciﬁc topic (e.g.,
online gambling and shopping) or pattern (e.g., short words
and city names). Through manual analysis, we observed a few
registrants performing opportunistic registration extensively.
Since personal emails are used for all such registration, the
registrations are unlikely to be defensive (i.e., registration
performed by a reputable company for brand protection).
Table III shows the top 5 registrant emails ordered by number
of IDNs. We found all IDNs owned by a registrant are
dedicated for the same purpose, by analyzing the meaning
of domain names. As an example, all 1, 562 IDNs registered
by PI:EMAIL are related to online gambling.
Finding 4. At least hundreds of registrars offer IDN
registrations. 55% IDNs were registered by top 10 reg-
istrars. We identiﬁed over 700 registrars through clustering
IDNs by their registrar ﬁeld, showing IDN registration is
an indispensable business category for many registrars. As
shown in Table IV, more than half of IDNs belong to 10
registrars and 70% belong to top 20. Interestingly, though

GoDaddy dominates the global domain market, it only takes
a small share of 1.88% when it comes to IDNs. Registrars
facing east-Asian markets are more active: for example, GMO,
a Japanese Internet company, accounts for 23% IDNs and
HiChina Zhicheng accounts for 10.86% IDNs. By contrast,
the sampled 1.2 million non-IDNs belong to more than 1, 500
registrars, suggesting not all registrars offer IDN service.
C. DNS Statistics
Our passive DNS dataset allowed us to assess the visits
ﬂowing to IDNs and estimate their popularity among Internet
users. Here we consider two metrics, active time and query
volume, for this measurement. Active time is the time span in
which DNS requests are observed (the time difference between
the ﬁrst and last requests). Query volume is the total number of
requests. As comparison, we also computed the same metrics
for non-IDNs. Lastly, we extracted the observed IP addresses
in their DNS responses to learn how IDNs are located.
Finding 5. IDNs have signiﬁcantly shorter active time
than non-IDNs, except for malicious IDNs. Illustrated in
Figure 2, the distributions of active time between IDN and
non-IDN are clearly separated. As an example, 60% of com
IDNs stayed active for less than 100 days, while 40% non-
IDNs under com have the same property. The differences
become even larger under other TLDs. However, we notice
