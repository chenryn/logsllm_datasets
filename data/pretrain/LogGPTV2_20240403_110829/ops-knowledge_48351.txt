User: I have noticed that several mature Python libraries have precompiled versions for most architectures (Win32/Win-amd64/MacOS) and versions of Python. What is the standard way to cross-compile your extensions for different environments? Wine? Virtual machines? Crowd sourcing?
Assistant: SWIG provides a path for multiplatform code generation.
