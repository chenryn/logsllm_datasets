User: How to protect data security on the server? Please introduce several common security measures.
Assistant: 1. Firewall settings: Use a firewall to restrict network connections, prevent unauthorized access and protect servers from attacks. 2. Access control: Set access rights for the server, restrict unnecessary user access, and ensure that sensitive information is only accessed by authorized users. 3. Data backup: Back up data frequently to prevent data loss or threats. Also, make sure that backups of your data are stored in a safe place. 4. Security patches: Security patches can fix vulnerabilities in the operating system, software, and applications to avoid exploiting vulnerabilities to attack servers. 5. Password protection: Servers should be protected with strong passwords, reinforced by changing passwords regularly, restricting password access, and using multi-factor authentication. 6. Security log record: record security events, so that the attack can be tracked and located when a security threat occurs. 7. Security scan: Regular security scans are performed on the server to detect vulnerabilities and take measures to repair them to ensure the security of the server. 8. Limit services: Only install and run necessary services to limit the attack surface and avoid the exploitation of security holes.
