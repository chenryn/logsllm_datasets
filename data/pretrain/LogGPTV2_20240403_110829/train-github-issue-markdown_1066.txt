We recently started to use the cluster sniffing feature in the Java API for
node discovery which works great. But in our cluster setup we have 3 nodes
(out of 9) which have different hardware (disk, less iops) and those are
causing performance problems when they have to handle requests. To solve the
issue I disabled sniffing again and didn't connect to those 3 nodes.
In order to still have node discovery in case a node is added or removed
to/from the cluster it would be great to have an exclusion feature.
    Settings.Builder settingsBuilder = Settings.settingsBuilder()
                    .put("cluster.name", "cluster")
                    .put("client.transport.sniff", true).
                    .putArray("client.transport.sniff.exclude", "node1", "node2", ...);
So sniffing would detect every x seconds all the nodes in the cluster, but it
will not connect to the ones which are excluded.
