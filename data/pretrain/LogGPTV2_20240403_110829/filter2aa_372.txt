## Introduction
Hello, Defcon 19! My name is Paul Craig, and I am a penetration tester at Security-Assessment.com. Hacking is not just my profession; it's my passion. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email me.

People in my life have often mentioned that I have an addictive personality. My obsession with kiosk hacking has become a significant part of my life, to the point where it almost controls me. Colleagues at Security-Assessment.com jokingly refer to me as "That Crazy Kiosk Guy." It's a secret addictionâ€”whenever I see an internet kiosk, I feel compelled to hack it. 

I've come to accept this as a unique challenge. If someone needs to be hacking these kiosks, why not me? I believe that without my efforts, vendors might win, and security vulnerabilities might go unnoticed. So, I decided to embrace my passion and take on the kiosk software industry head-on.

## Overview
### What is an Internet Kiosk?
- **Definition:** A machine that allows users to pay for internet access.
- **Hardware:** Typically an x86 desktop running Windows or Linux.
- **Locations:** Hotels, motels, airports, libraries, lobbies, and casinos.
- **Appearance:** [Example Image]

### How Kiosks Are Secured
Kiosk vendors take security seriously, and most of the functionality in kiosk software is security-related. A secure kiosk is often an expensive one, with features like:
- **User Interface Security:** Graphically jailed into a kiosk interface with reduced functionality.
- **Activity Blacklist:** Monitors and blocks unlawful activities.
- **Locked-Down Host Environment:** Kiosk user has no rights or privileges.

### Key Learnings
1. **Blacklists Don't Work:** There are countless ways to bypass blacklists.
2. **Websites Visited from a Kiosk Are Overlooked:** Remote websites can have more access than the user.
3. **Browsers Implement 'Security by User Interaction':** Browsers trust the person on the keyboard.
4. **Physical Access Always Wins:** Microsoft's Ten Immutable Laws of Security emphasize that local user trust must be blocked.

### Hacking Kiosks
Hacking kiosks is like solving a puzzle. Our goal is to pop a shell (spawn cmd, explorer, xterm) using only the browser and no taskbar. This involves finding a way to escape the kiosk environment.

### iKAT: Interactive Kiosk Attack Tool
- **Description:** A SaaS website designed to help escape jailed browser environments.
- **Features:** Simple tools in one place.
- **History:** Launched at Defcon 16, now up to version 4.
- **Usage:** On average, 25-30 kiosks per day visit iKAT, with a tenfold increase during Defcon 18.

### My Approach for Hacking Kiosks
1. **Identify the Platform and Vendor Software:**
   - Look for logos or brand names.
   - Determine if the look and feel is similar to Windows or Linux.
   - Use iKAT to detect installed applications.

2. **Enumerate All Available Windows:**
   - Click every button, window, and link.
   - Use Shift-Click, Ctrl-Click, Double Click, Right Click.
   - Try to spawn common dialogs.

3. **Enumerate Registered File Handlers:**
   - Use file types to spawn binaries or escape the kiosk.
   - Test file types like PDF, ASX, DOCX, XLS.

4. **Enumerate Registered URI Protocol Handlers:**
   - Spawn applications from URI handlers.
   - Check for common dialogs and content launch capabilities.

5. **Install/Run Browser Add-ons:**
   - Use ActiveX, Java, SilverLight, Flash.
   - Signed vs. Unsigned Code: The $500 Problem.

6. **Crash the Kiosk:**
   - Create unhandled exceptions to crash the browser.
   - Exploit vulnerabilities in Flash, ActiveX, Java, JavaScript, VBScript, PDF files, HTML rendering, and malformed images.

7. **Windows Shell Hacking:**
   - Use ShowWindow() to enable hidden windows.
   - Bypass Group Policy and SRP rules.

### iKAT v4: New Features
- **Windows Group Policy + SRP Bypass:**
  - Pre-patched Windows binaries to bypass local group policies.
- **Metasploit Integration:**
  - Dedicated Metasploit instance for download_exec payloads.
  - One-click shells.
- **File Reflection:**
  - Analyze content from kiosks via file upload.
  - Tools include a web-based hex editor and cache analyzer.

## Conclusions
- **Personal Note:** I am addicted to kiosks, and hacking them is both enjoyable and creative.
- **Call to Action:** If you haven't tried kiosk hacking before, give it a shot. If one guy from New Zealand can do this, imagine what you can achieve.
