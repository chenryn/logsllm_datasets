Internet Kiosk Terminals  
The Redux

Defcon 19 – Las Vegas 
 Hello Defcon 19 
 My name is Paul Craig 
 I work at Security-Assessment.com as a penetration tester. 
 I love to hack stuff, its my life, and my profession.  
 If you have any questions or comments – Please email me 
 PI:EMAIL 
 People in my life have told me that I have an  
 Addictive Personality 
My obsession with Kiosk hacking began to have a negative effect on my 
life… Hacking Kiosks controlled me. 
“Paul, You just need a distraction” 
 My colleagues at SA know me as “That Crazy Kiosk Guy” 
 “All I do is Hack Internet Kiosks” 
 Its my secret addiction. 
 Whenever I see an Internet Kiosk, I have to hack it. 
 I cant stop myself. 
 I have a problem, its an addiction. 
 The 8 Stages of Grief: #7 Acceptance 
 “Someone has to be hacking these damn Kiosks, so why not you?” 
 I am the only guy in the world with a Kiosk addiction. 
Without my effort the vendors might win. 
 I decided to take ownership of my passion 
 Embrace my addiction 
 “Ill just fucking hack all of them” 
 Every vendor, every product, every platform. 
 Yeah fuck it, why not.?

 What is an Internet Kiosk ? 
 A machine that takes payment to let you surf the internet 
 Typically an x86 desktop running Windows or Linux 
 Found at hotels, motels, airports, libraries, lobbies, casinos.. 
They look like this: 
How Kiosks Are Secured 
 Kiosk vendors take security seriously 
 The majority of functionality in Kiosk software is security related 
 A secure Kiosk is an expensive Kiosk 
 Lock Downed, Secured, Hardened, Protected Environments 
This is because hackers LOVE hacking Kiosks! 
How Kiosks Are Secured 
1.
User Interface Security 
 Graphically jailed into a Kiosk interface 
 Cut-down/reduced functionality desktop 
 No way to get back to “Windows” or run explorer, cmd.exe 
2. Activity Blacklist 
 Everything you do is monitored and unlawful activity is blocked 
 Configurable blacklists: 
 Windows displayed, Buttons clicked 
 Processes executed, API‟s called 
3. Locked-Down Host Environment 
 Kiosk user has no rights, no privileges 
 Cannot run binaries on the Kiosk 
 Four things I have learnt about Kiosks 
 1) Blacklists Just Don‟t Work 
 The security industry knows this, why don‟t Kiosk vendors ? 
 Thousand different ways to do anything 
 Kiosk blacklists are never able to stop EVERY method 
 2) Websites Visited From A Kiosk Are Overlooked 
 A remote website often has more access to the Kiosk than you. 
 Kiosks rely on a default browser security policy (Typically Internet Explorer) 
 3) Browsers Implement „Security By User Interaction‟ 
 Browser technology will trust the person on the keyboard 
 “Are you sure you want to run this?” 
 4) Physical Access Always Wins. 
Microsoft‟s Ten immutable laws of security. 
 Operating systems will trust the local user 
 Kiosk software must go against the grain of design 
 “It Only Takes One Instance” 
 Every instance of trusting the local user has to be blocked 
 It only takes one instance of trust to hack a Kiosk 
 Hacking Kiosks 
 The great thing about hacking Kiosks is that its easy! 
 Its like solving a puzzle or doing a Sudoku 
 Our goal: Pop Shell ( Spawn cmd, explorer, xterm) 
 How could you run cmd.exe on Windows 
 If you only had Internet Explorer open 
 And no Task Bar (“Start”) 
 In a nut shell this is what Kiosk hacking is all about. 
 Finding a way of escaping the Kiosk environment 
 What is iKAT ? – Interactive Kiosk Attack Tool 
 iKAT is a SAAS website that you visit from a Kiosk 
 One-Stop-Shop for escaping jailed browser environments 
 Contains simple tools in one handy place 
 First launched at Defcon 16, iKAT is now up to v4 
 Defcon 19 - iKAT Vengeance Edition 
 iKAT has become the de facto standard for Kiosk hacking 
 On average 25-30 Kiosks per day „visit‟ iKAT 
 During Defcon 18 my traffic stats increased ten fold! 
 My Approach for Hacking Kiosks: 
 This is how I break Kiosk software 
 #1 - Identify the platform and vendor software in use 
 Look for a logo or brand name associated with the Kiosk 
 Is the look and feel similar to Windows, or Linux ? 
 Determining the platform allows for specific targeting 
 Find what applications are installed 
 iKAT : “Detect Installed Applications” 
 #2 – Enumerate All Available Windows 
 Systematically click every button, window, link 
 Shift-Click, Ctrl-Click, Double Click, Right Click 
 Can you spawn a common Dialog ?  
 File -> Open, File -> Save, File-> Print 
 Common Dialogs have Explorer controls 
 Browse to C:\Windows\system32, cmd.exe open… 
 Controls are also WebDAV Enabled (They can Download / Upload ) 
 #3 – Enumerate Registered File Handlers 
 Any installed application can be used to escape a Kiosk 
 Image Viewer, Media Player, PDF Reader 
 Use an innocent file type to spawn a binary or escape the Kiosk 
 PDF File with /Launch cmd.exe 
 ASX With embedded web content 
 DOCX with embedded binaries 
 XLS with embedded VBA Macro‟s 
 What file types will the Kiosk let us download 
 Direct file type “test.exe”, “test.exe?.txt” 
 Content Disposition attachment download 
 Flash DownloadURL object 
 #4 – Enumerate Registered URI Protocol Handlers 
 Spawn an application from a URI handler 
 mailto://. Callto://, hcp://, shell::, file://, mms://, ftp:// 
 Image Viewer, Media Player, PDF Reader 
 Can we spawn one of these URI handlers 
 Does the handling application contains a common dialog ? 
 Can we launch content from within the URI handler 
 Does the Kiosk software support any internal URI handlers ? 
 Admin:// 
 Skconfig:// 
 #5 – Can I Install / Run My Own Browser Add-on 
 ActiveX, Click Once(.NET), Java, SilverLight, Flash 
 Java, ActiveX and ClickOnce can spawn processes. 
 They can also create Common Dialogs 
 iKAT v1 was full of browser add-ons. 
 Vendors caught up quickly: ”Trusted CA *Signed* Add-ons only” 
 Signed Vs Unsigned Code: The $500 Problem. 
 “Please donate to iKAT so I can buy a Code Signing Certificate” 
 iKAT now supports 100% signed code, from a trusted CA 
 #6 – Crash the Kiosk 
 The fastest way to escape a Kiosk jail is to crash it. 
 Emo-Kiosking: “I cut myself to release the pain” 
 Create an unhandled exception in the browser 
 Crash the browser back to the desktop 
 Flash, ActiveX, Java, JavaScript, VBScript, PDF files, 
HTML Rendering, Malformed Images 
 Browsers just love to crash! 
 Unhandled exceptions are a huge security issue with Kiosks. 
 #7 – Win Shell Hacking 
 iKAT features tools to help you hack the Windows Shell environment. 
 Make Visible – Use ShowWindow() to enable all hidden Windows 
 Anti Virus, Backup, Remote Admin, Kiosk Software often have hidden 
Windows that are set WS_Visible False.  
 Debug Windows 
 Hidden Administrative Windows 
 Log messages 
iKAT – What's New? 
 When iKAT was first launched  it had GREAT success 
 “5 seconds, 50 shells.” 
 Then the vendors found out and fixed my attack vectors. 
 Some vendors simply blocked ikat.ha.cked.net 
 Other vendors used iKAT as a testing bed for their own security. 
 Cat and Mouse Game 
 Every year I find new vulnerabilities in Kiosk products 
 Every year the vendors fix the vulnerabilities I discover 
 The following year it gets harder. 
 Its getting much harder.. But I keep trying! 
 Finding new features to add to iKAT also becomes harder 
 Windows Group Policy + SRP Bypass 
 Kiosk admins love to implement Windows group policy 
 “Command Prompt has been Disabled by your System administrator” 
 iKAT V features an extensive collection of “Unlocked” Windows binaries 
 cscript, cmd, osk, regedit, explorer, control, taskmgr, sc, wscript, 
runonce, rasphone.  
 Pre-patched Windows binaries which will not validate any local group 
policies 
 Modified to bypass SRP + App Locker rules (hash, certificate, file name) 
 iKAT has added MetaSploit Magic 
 The iKAT server now hosts a dedicated Metasploit instance 
 Serving download_exec payloads which will run iKAT payloads 
 Dedicated “AutoPwn” Server 
 One Click – Shells. 
 Most Kiosks are shipping with unpatched browser libraries 
 Kiosks themselves are not patched 
 Metasploit Autopwn has a good rate of success. 
 File Reflection 
 The iKAT server now services to help you compromise a Kiosk 
 “Send me content from a Kiosk via File Upload and iKAT will analyse it 
for you” 
 Windows Registry Files 
 Web Based Hex Editor 
 Cache Analyser 
 Ok, enough talking 
 Lets hack some Kiosks. 
 Conclusions 
 I am addicted to Kiosks 
 Hacking Kiosks is easy, enjoyable and creative 
 If you haven't done it before, try it. 
 If one guy from NZ can do this, just think what you can do.
