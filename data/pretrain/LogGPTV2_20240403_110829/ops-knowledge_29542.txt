User: I messed up my IDLE shortcut. What is the way to start IDLE from the cmd.exe shell in Windows?
Assistant: You can just add a path in your Environment variables tab in My Computer Properties --> Advanced as c:\Python27\Lib\idlelib. After adding this path just write idle.pyw in cmd whenever you want to run IDLE.  
Just make sure you replace the folder name with whatever directory name you have.
