User: How to perform performance testing on software or system? Please provide tools and indicators.
Assistant: Performance testing is a test method for evaluating the performance of software or systems under specific loads. It can detect and measure the response time, throughput, concurrency, stability, etc. of the system under access, concurrent users, and load conditions. Performance. The following are commonly used tools and metrics when performing performance testing. Tools: 1. Apache JMeter: An open source stress testing tool developed in Java for testing static and dynamic resources. 2. LoadRunner: A powerful stress testing software that can simulate realistic loads for testing and supports multiple protocols and technologies. 3. Gatling: A Scala-based high-performance load testing tool for Web applications, HTTP, WebSocket, and JMS. 4. Locust: A Python tool for load testing, which can use the powerful functions of Python for testing and supports distributed testing. Metrics: 1. Response time: The time from when a user sends a request to when the system responds. 2. Throughput: The number of requests that the system can handle within a certain period of time. 3. Number of concurrent users: the maximum number of users who can access the system at the same time. 4. Resource utilization: the utilization of system resources such as CPU, memory, and disk. 5. Error rate: The ratio of the number of errors to the total request volume during the test period of the system. 6. Average load: the CPU load of the system during the test period. 7. Database performance: database query performance, concurrent access capability, response time, etc.
