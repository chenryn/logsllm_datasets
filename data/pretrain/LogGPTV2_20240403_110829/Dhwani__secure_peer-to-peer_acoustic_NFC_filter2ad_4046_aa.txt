ABSTRACT
Near Field Communication (NFC) enables physically proximate
devices to communicate over very short ranges in a peer-to-peer
manner without incurring complex network conﬁguration overheads.
However, adoption of NFC-enabled applications has been stymied
by the low levels of penetration of NFC hardware.
In this paper, we address the challenge of enabling NFC-like
capability on the existing base of mobile phones. To this end,
we develop Dhwani, a novel, acoustics-based NFC system that
uses the microphone and speakers on mobile phones, thus elimi-
nating the need for any specialized NFC hardware. A key feature
of Dhwani is the JamSecure technique, which uses self-jamming
coupled with self-interference cancellation at the receiver, to pro-
vide an information-theoretically secure communication channel
between the devices. Our current implementation of Dhwani achieves
data rates of up to 2.4 Kbps, which is sufﬁcient for most existing
NFC applications.

INTRODUCTION
Near-Field Communication (NFC) enables low data rate, bidi-
rectional communication between devices within close proximity,
usually within a few centimeters, in a peer-to-peer manner. The key
advantage of NFC is that it eliminates the need for cumbersome
network conﬁguration efforts required to set up a communication
channel using alternatives such as Bluetooth or WiFi. This is due
to its inherent property of association by physical proximity — if
two devices can communicate using NFC, then it implies that they
must be co-located. As an example, using an NFC enabled mobile
phone, a user can make payments by simply bringing the phone
close to a reader at the checkout counter, without having to ﬁrst
identify the reader or connect to it.

Several NFC-based applications have been proposed or demon-
strated, e.g., contact-less payment, access control, social network-
ing, ticketing, museum services, etc. In many cases, NFC is used
to automatically initiate and set up a high data rate communica-
tion channel such as WiFi or Bluetooth. However, the adoption
of these applications has been stymied by the low levels of pen-
etration of NFC hardware, estimated to be just 3-5% [11] among
mobile phones worldwide and only about 12% [10] even in an ad-
vanced market such as the U.S., as of 2012. Even as far out as
2016, the penetration is expected to be under 50%. Correspond-
ingly, the prevalence of NFC-enabled point-of-sale (POS) terminals
is also low — under 5% today and expected to rise to only about
49% globally by 2017 [9]. Even disregarding the optimism that
usually colours such forecasts, it seems likely that the majority of
phones and POS terminals globally will not be NFC-enabled even
3-4 years from now. Thus, the opportunities for using NFC appli-
cations such as peer-to-peer transfers or contact-less payments will
remain rather limited.
Can we enable NFC-like functionality on today’s devices? We
answer this question in the afﬁrmative by presenting Dhwani, a
novel, acoustics-based system that uses the existing microphones
and speakers on phones to enable NFC, thus, eliminating the need
for specialized NFC hardware. As in conventional NFC, where
communication through magnetic coupling is conﬁned to a short
range, acoustic communication in Dhwani is conﬁned to a short
range (few cm). Thus, similar to conventional NFC, Dhwani en-
ables the “association by proximity” functionality needed for ap-
plications such as P2P transfers and contact-less payments.
A key advantage of Dhwani over conventional NFC is that it is a
purely software-based solution, that can run on legacy phones, in-
cluding feature phones, so long as they have a speaker and a micro-
phone. Consequently, much of the installed base of phones today
could use Dhwani to perform P2P NFC communication. That said,
the use of acoustic communication means that, unlike conventional
NFC, Dhwani is not amenable to implementation in passive tags.
A second signiﬁcant advantage of Dhwani over conventional NFC
is in terms of information-theoretic, physical-layer security. As dis-
cussed in Section 3.1, the security model in Dhwani is that the de-
vices seeking to communicate are trusted and immune to tamper-
ing. However, in their midst might be one or more eavesdroppers.
Conventional NFC does not incorporate any security at the physical
or MAC layers since the short range of communication (about 10
cm) is in itself presumed to offer a degree of protection. However,
in [16], the authors demonstrate that it is possible to snoop on NFC
communications from a distance of 20-30 cm using an oscilloscope
and a standard tag antenna. The authors also conjecture that with a
more sophisticated sniffer antenna, such snooping should be possi-
ble from a distance of a meter or more.
63Dhwani provides security at the physical layer using a novel self-
jamming technique, JamSecure, wherein the receiver intentionally
jams the signal it is trying to receive, thereby stymying eaves-
droppers, but then uses self-interference cancellation to success-
fully decode the incoming message. The security thus obtained is
information-theoretic, i.e., Dhwani inherently prevents the leakage
of information to an eavesdropper. This is in contrast to crypto-
graphic security, which is based on assumptions about computa-
tional hardness. Even if cryptographic security protocols are em-
ployed at the higher layers, Dhwani enables key exchange without
the need for any shared secret or certiﬁcates to be set up a priori.
This is a signiﬁcant advantage, since creating a public key infras-
tructure (PKI) spanning billions of devices would be challenging.
In order to enable Dhwani we implemented an Acoustic Soft-
ware Deﬁned Radio (ASDR) on the mobile devices that uses speak-
ers and microphones to receive and transmit data. Our ASDR de-
sign had to address several challenges unique to the nature of the
acoustic signal propagation and speaker-microphone characteris-
tics. For example, we found the gain of the speaker-microphone
combination in phones to be extremely non-uniform across the range
of frequencies (frequency selectivity), presumably due to the me-
chanical properties of their electro-mechanical parts (e.g.,vibrating
membranes). Further, the high degree of ringing in the acoustic
channel (reverberations), compared to Radio Frequency (RF), ren-
dered the existing RF self-interference cancellation techniques in-
adequate. Consequently, for Dhwani, we present a novel and efﬁ-
cient technique for self-interference cancellation, which takes ad-
vantage of the fact that the jamming sequence can be predetermined
by the receiver.
We present the design and implementation of Dhwani, an anal-
ysis of its security properties, and an experimental evaluation on
mobile devices such as phones and laptops. To sum up, the main
contributions of our work are
• A characterization of the acoustic hardware and environment in
the context of mobile phones.
• An Acoustic Software Deﬁned Radio suitable for operation on
mobile phones.
• The JamSecure self-jamming technique for providing information-
theoretic, physical-layer security.
2. AN NFC PRIMER
As described in Section 1, NFC enables conﬁguration-free low
data rate communication between two devices in close physical
proximity. NFC standards (ISO/IEC 18092/ECMA-340, NFC IP-
1, ISO/IEC 14443) have evolved from RFID technology. However,
while RFID readers can read tags up to distances of a few meters,
NFC readers are designed to read at distances of a few centimeters.
NFC devices can operate either in an active mode, in which the
device (e.g., a reader) generates its own electromagnetic ﬁeld, or in
a passive mode, in which the device (e.g., a tag) is powered by the
electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by another device in its proximity.
There are three modes of NFC interaction available for a mobile
device such as a phone:
• Read/Write: An NFC-enabled phone, operating in active mode,
can Read/Write data from/to a passive tag.
• Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Two NFC-enabled phones, each operating
in active mode, can exchange data.
• Card Emulation: An NFC-enabled phone can emulate a smart
card, allowing an active reader to read from it.
In this paper, we limit ourselves to the P2P mode of NFC.
How NFC works. Current day NFC technology works on the prin-
ciple of magnetic induction. Each NFC device is equipped with an
antenna coil. Typically, one of the devices initiates communication
by passing a current through its antenna coil. This current gener-
ates a magnetic ﬁeld, which then induces current in the receiving
device’s antenna coil. Thus, the two devices essentially form an
air-core transformer. Data is transmitted by modulating the current
passed through the transmitter coil.
Existing NFC standards employ Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
in the 13.56 MHz spectrum, with a bandwidth of about 1.8 MHz.
Three different data rates are supported: 106, 212 and 424 Kbps.
Typically, Manchester coding with 10% modulation is used, imply-
ing that the low and high amplitudes are 10% off on either side of
the carrier amplitude.
NFC is intended only for small data transfers; e.g., NFC tags are
typically equipped with a memory size of 96 to 512 bytes. Often,
when a large amount of data needs to be transferred, NFC is only
used to set up the initial connection for a higher data rate standard
such as Bluetooth or WiFi. Instant user gratiﬁcation is an impor-
tant requirement of NFC, so the communication delay should not
exceed a few seconds.
Security in NFC. The air interface and data link layer for NFC
does not include any provision for security (NFCIP-1 [4]), with
information being transmitted in the clear. For the P2P mode of
NFC, newer security standards, layered on top of the data link layer,
have been deﬁned. NFC-SEC [7] deﬁnes the framework for secu-
rity services, including a shared secret service and a secure channel
service. The actual security protocols are speciﬁed in NFC-SEC-
01 [6], including Elliptic Curves Difﬁe-Hellman (ECDH) for key
agreement and the AES algorithm for data encryption and integrity.
However, as noted in [5], NFC-SEC-01 does not protect against
man-in-the-middle attacks because no entity authentication can be
provided when the peer NFC devices do not share any secret a
priori. It is further noted that the practical risk of a man-in-the-
middle attack is low due to the short operating distance, but that
users should be aware of and carefully evaluate the potential vul-
nerability in their setting.
The authors in [13] discuss various attacks, including eavesdrop-
ping and data modiﬁcation, that could be mounted on NFC at the
physical layer. They report eavesdropping ranges of 1m and 10m,
respectively, for the passive and active modes. Furthermore, an at-
tacker can perform data modiﬁcation (particularly with the 10%
modulation that is commonly employed) by injecting signal en-
ergy during a “low” period to make the corresponding amplitude
higher than in the following “high” period, thereby ﬂipping the cor-
responding bit.
Compared to the NFC security enhancements, such as NFC-
SEC-01, the physical-layer security provided by Dhwani avoids
the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks by allowing the peers
to securely establish a secret without requiring any a priori shared
secret or third-party communication.
3. DHWANI - THE KEY IDEAS
The goal of Dhwani is to enable NFC-like functionality, i.e.,
conﬁguration-free short-range communication, in a wide array of
existing mobile devices, while also ensuring physical-layer secu-
rity. In this section, we present an overview of Dhwani highlighting
the key novel aspects.
3.1 Security Model in Dhwani
The security goal of Dhwani is to ensure the secrecy and integrity
of messages exchanged between a transmitter and receiver pair lo-
cated within close proximity (a few centimeters), in the presence of
attackers. In this section we make the following assumptions about
Dhwani’s operation and security model:
64• Both transacting devices (transmitter and receiver) are trusted
entities. These devices are assumed to function correctly and
execute the Dhwani protocol faithfully. Any failure is presumed
to be only accidental (e.g., due to a power outage).
• The attacker is presumed to be capable of mounting both pas-
sive (e.g., eavesdropping) and active attacks (e.g., message in-
sertion). However, we assume that the attacker is unable to di-
rectly tamper with the trusted entities or alter their functioning.
• The communication range of the transacting devices is limited
to a few centimeters.
The above assumptions are consistent with the NFC model, wherein
association, and the consequent transaction, happen implicitly through
physical proximity. So, for instance, users who swipe their NFC-
capable cards at a point-of-sale (POS) terminal are presumed to
have satisﬁed themselves about the authenticity of the POS termi-
nal, say based on its location in the check-out area of a reputable
store. The only concern would be the possibility of attackers lurk-
ing in the vicinity. Note that as discussed in Section 8, Dhwani’s
security can be potentially subverted, albeit with great difﬁculty,
using sophisticated directional antenna or antenna arrays. How-
ever, we believe that Dhwani raises the bar for active and passive
attackers signiﬁcantly compared to the state of the art.
3.2 Acoustic Characterization
While the use of the acoustic channel for NFC offers the promise
of a broad footprint, we have to contend with the peculiarities of
both the acoustic hardware (speakers and microphones) in mobile
devices and the acoustic environment. While acoustic communi-
cation has been studied with specialized hardware and in speciﬁc
domains such as underwater communication, we are not aware of
prior work on characterizing off-the-shelf mobile devices in the
context of over-the-air communication, as we present in Section 4.
We ﬁnd a high degree of ambient noise, signiﬁcant ringing (rever-
berations), and highly frequency selective fading due to the electro-
mechanical nature of the speakers and microphones. These ﬁndings
inform the design of the Acoustic Software Deﬁned Radio and also
the JamSecure technique in Dhwani.
3.3 Acoustic Software Deﬁned Radio
Dhwani provides an Acoustic Software Deﬁned Radio (ASDR)
service, which applications can use to transmit or receive pack-
ets. As described in Section 5, Dhwani’s ASDR implements almost
all of the functionality of a standard modern day radio, including
OFDM modulation and demodulation, error correction coding, etc.
However, a key difference in Dhwani’s ASDR compared to tradi-
tional RF radios is that it has no notion of a carrier frequency and
a separate baseband. The reason is that the ADC is able to sample
at a rate (44 KHz) that is sufﬁcient for the entire acoustic band-
width supported by the speaker and microphone. A sampling rate
of 44 KHz allows operating (at best) in the 0-22 KHz band. Con-
sequently, Dhwani implements a carrier-less OFDM over the entire
0-22KHz band, simply suppressing (i.e., nulling) sub-carriers that
are not suitable for use, either because of the ambient noise (Sec-
tion 4.1) or because of the speaker and microphone characteristics.
3.4 JamSecure
JamSecure is a novel self-jamming technique used by the re-
ceiver in Dhwani to cloak the message being transmitted by the
transmitter, thereby preventing an attacker from receiving the mes-
sage. Figure 1 depicts the key idea behind JamSecure. Transmitter
