only hardware devices used in both physical ﬁeld and train-
server communications are considered. Although we are aware
that software fails more frequently than hardware, it is difﬁcult
to measure the life spans and failures of software components
at the time of this work. Thirdly, in our model, we do not
incorporate the effect of device aging and maintenance on the
MTTF of hardwares. Fourthly, in practical, the operation of the
train service consists of multiple instances of traction power
sub-systems,
train communication sub-systems and rolling
stock sub-systems. However, due to the computation limit of
existing tool, we only consider one instance of each. It is
intuitive that the calculated MTTF of this train service model
is the lower bound for that of the whole train system since all
these instances will be composed by OR gates.
A. Traction Power Sub-System (TPSS)
TPSS is used for extracting power from power source to
feed the train. The topology sketch is drafted in Figure 6.

Fig. 8: A Device of Train Communication Sub-System
In order to ensure the data integrity, a consensus logic
is designed in certain components. For example, there are
three identical inputs from three running devices where the
component will output the majority’s data. Thus at least two
of the inputs should be identical in order for the component
to output a successful data, i.e., if faults occur in two input
devices, the component fails. This features a voting gate as
shown in Figure 8.
Failure in train communication system is induced by com-
ponent failures, such as an actual defect of the communication
media, a defect of trackside equipment, faults in wireless
network, or failures in central server. The whole DFT of
signalling system consists of 24 basic events connected over 5
SPARE gates, 1 VOTING gate, 2 AND gates and 7 OR gates.
C. Rolling Stock Sub-System (RSSS)
A rolling stock system is referred as the operation system
deployed on trainborne. It draws power supplied by TPSS
and is controlled by signalling system for operation. Thus,
we separately describe this sub-system according to the power
ﬂow and the control ﬂow. A simpliﬁed process is shown in
Figure 9.
There are usually two motor cars on each head of a train.
Each motor car consists of two bogies. To ensure normal
operation, at most one bogie of the four bogies is allowed
to fail. As shown in Figure 9, each bogie involves two shoes
on each side of the train, PFD1, PFD2, PFD3 (PFD stands
for power ﬂow device which is used to replace the real names
of these devices) and two traction motors. During operation,
two shoes of a motor car on the same side, each from one
bogie, are used for picking up power from 3rd rail. They are
designed for redundancy purposes such that if one shoe fails,
the train can still operate normally. However, if two shoes on
the motor car are damaged at the same time, this car would
not be able to draw any power from the 3rd rail. The train may
still operate but in a degraded mode which results in reduced
speed, or it may stop. The PFD1 and PFD2 are shared by two
bogies and are used for transmitting electricity power. PFD3
receives control commands from signalling system to propel
the two traction motors.
When a control message reaches the train, a trainborne
ATC will issue commands to initiate the duty circle. This
command is encoded and transmitted to CFDP (Control Flow
Device- Propulsion). At the same time, CFDM (Control Flow
Device- Motor) will be energised by ATC to decide if the

In TPSS, power is initially drawn from the public grid
located in two locations with a backup power grid. Power
is drawn to a common bus after being collected from the
source, and then ﬂows to each TPSS through certain devices
to electrify the 3rd rail. Several circuit breakers are used to
control the voltage and current in the system. Voltage and
current are monitored at certain points. In the normal mode,
circuit breakers are closed to transmit power to 3rd rail. These
circuit breakers ensure current
the 3rd
rail despite the existence of neutral gaps. Power supply on
3rd rail can be switched off by opening the relevant circuit
breakers. These circuit breakers on 3rd rail have redundancies.
According to the design of neutral gap, three track feeder
DC circuit breakers are used to control the power around one
natural gap. Two more circuit breakers are regarded as backup
for them. When the master circuit breakers fail, the backup
can take over to control the power supply around the certain
neutral gap.
to ﬂow throughout
Failure in power supply can be induced by several oper-
ational failures in TPSS such as the failure of public grid or
failure of set of circuit breakers. The whole DFT consists of 4
OR gates, 4 SPARE gates, 2 AND gates and 14 basic events.
A representative part of model is shown in Figure 7.
B. Train Communication Sub-System (TCSS)
Train communication sub-system is responsible for the
communication between train and signalling server. In modern
Communications-based train control (CBTC) systems, there
are central automatic train supervision (ATS) servers monitor
and control the train operations. A command from the ATS
server traverses wireless and wired communication channels
to reach the automatic train control (ATC) units resides both
trackside and on trainborne. ATCs are used to control the train
operations including accelerating, decelerating, braking etc.. At
the same time, the train is reporting its status to ATS servers
periodically.

2) Results: Table I summarises the minimal cut sets. A
complete computation over the whole system DFT model
yields the result that there are 5 single point failures. Note
that in the train communication system, there is only one
media for wireless communication. Although this media is
of high reliability, once it fails the whole system fails or in
a greatly degraded mode. Besides, from our knowledge, the
device PFD1 A is shared by 2 bogies on one motor car. Once
it fails, two bogies in the motor car will fail causing the train
system to be a degraded mode. It is similar in the case of
PFD1 B on the other motor car, PFD2 A and PFD2 B.

train is on propulsion mode and thus instruct CFDP to react
accordingly. The control unit is shared by all four bogies thus
we would consider the bogie is functionally dependant on the
control unit, as shown in Figure 10. The rolling stock system
model is then composed of four bogie models using a 2:4
voting gate.
Rolling stock failure is mainly sourced to propulsion failure
which is induced by either disruption of power collection
or the disruption of signal control. Propulsion signal control
disruption will be induced from encoder’s failure, trainborne
ATC failure, CFDM failure or CFDP failure. Power collection
disruption can be caused by a defect of current collecting shoe,
a defect from propulsion unit, i.e. traction motor and PFD3, or
a defect in breakers or switches. The whole DFT for propulsion
scenario in rolling stock includes 34 basic events connected by
4 FEDP gate, 9 AND gates, 9 OR gates, and 1 VOTING gate.
D. Compose All Models
We composed the aforesaid three cases (i.e., TPSS, TCSS,
and RSSS) into a whole DFT model, taking the train service
disruption as a top event. Special interest is taken in the ATC
components that are trainborne. The rolling stock sub-system
is functionally dependent on them who belongs to signalling
system. In this way, these two sub-systems are entangled. At
the higher level, all the three sub-models are composed by an
OR logic gate, as any of sub-system’s failure would cause the
whole system’s failure, that is, train service disruption. The
integrated DFT model for the whole system consists of 70
basic events connected over 9 SPARE gates, 4 FEDP gates, 2
VOTING gates, 13 AND gates, and 21 OR gates.
IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
Finally, two typical problems are being studied which are 1)
is the system vulnerable to single point failures by computing
the minimal cut sets? 2) what is the overall service reliability
based on low-level devices’ reliability information?
A. Minimal Cut Set Solution
1) Goal: Although redundancy design is widely adopted in
the train system, the coverage is unknown. Thus, the purpose
of this calculation is to ﬁnd out if the system suffers single
point failure. We use Dugan’s top-down algorithm.

B. Mean Time To Failure and Reliability Solution
1) Goal: To validate the composed DFT model, adopted
an open source tool, DFTCalc introduced in Section II-C,
to quantitatively analyse the train system. The web-version
DFTCalc tool is used in this work, it takes the DFT models in
Galileo [6] format. Besides, for safety and security purpose,
anonymised data is used.
2) Results:
a) MTTF: For each of the DFT model, we plotted the
mean time to failure of each sub-system and the probability
that the system will fail over time. The results are shown in
Figure 11 and Table II summarises the mean time to failure
for each model.

Note: Since the state space is too large for computation, we
replace the TPSS system as a single event. The ﬁnal result
won’t be affected since it is a standalone system, meaning no
sharing components with other sub-systems.
b) Failure Between Timed Interval: This experiment
explores the distribution of failures along time, in other words,
when is the failure most likely to happen. For an example, in
the black curve of Figure 12, the second star point indicates
that the probability of ﬁrst system failure happens between
25k hours and 50k hours is highest. In the ﬁgure, the X axis
stands for a timed interval and the Y axis stands for the
probability of the ﬁrst system failure. The legend indicates
the time units used for each experimented sub-system. For
example, T P SS(10khrs) indicates that the time units used
in black curve is 10,000 hours. The failure rate would ﬁrst

fail in the very early stage of the running system and much
more likely to fail when the system has run till the time around
MTTF and afterwards, the unreliability will drop because most
likely the system has already failed.
C. Observations
inspection. With our systematic analysis, industry people are
able to thoroughly inspect the system for all possibilities. How-
ever, solutions to compensate for these single point failures are
not known at the moment.
Secondly, from our experiment results, the train system
is more vulnerable to failures in the signalling system. The
