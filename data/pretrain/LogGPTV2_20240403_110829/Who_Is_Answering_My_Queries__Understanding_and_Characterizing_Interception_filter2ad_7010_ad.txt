• DNSIntercept is found to exist in 198 ASes glob-
ally. For the public DNS services we investigate, up to
0.66% of DNS requests over TCP sent from the client
are intercepted. Meanwhile, interception behaviors
exist in both reputable ASes and those with a lower
ranking.
• As for interception scenarios, Request redirection and
Request replication are both found in top 20 ASes
with most intercepted requests to Google DNS. Direct
responding is rare, as it is more likely to be discovered
by clients.
• For most of top 20 ASes, only one interception type
is found within an AS, suggesting uniﬁed intercep-
tion policies. Moreover, it is found that an intercep-
tor can exclusively intercept DNS trafﬁc sent to spe-
ciﬁc public DNS services (e.g., Google Public DNS).
The concrete strategies differ among different inter-
ceptors. We also discover 82 ASes are intercepting
more than 90% DNS trafﬁc sent to Google Public
DNS.
5 TCP/UDP DNS Interception Analysis
(China-wide)
order
to
learn more
characteristics
In
about
DNSIntercept, we design another experiment called
China-wide analysis.
In this section, we ﬁrst, on the
whole, give an analysis on interception characteristics
towards different kinds of DNS packets. Moreover,
we also discuss issues regarding DNS lookup per-
formance and response manipulation introduced by
DNSIntercept. Finally, we discuss potential motiva-
tions of such interception behavior.
5.1
Interception Characteristics
In our experiment setup, we launch DNS packets with
diverse ﬁeld values from our clients to public DNS ser-
vices. On the whole, by comparing the interception ratio
of packets of different ﬁeld values, we ﬁrst investigate
what kinds of packets are more likely to be intercepted.
Table 5 presents our summary of results in this phase.
Transport protocol. Compared to those over TCP, DNS
requests over UDP from clients are more likely to be in-
tercepted. For instance, 27.9% DNS requests sent to
Google Public DNS over UDP are redirected or repli-
cated, the ratio being only 7.3% when it is through TCP.
In fact, most of DNS requests in the real world are over
UDP, and intercepting UDP trafﬁc is technically easier.
Therefore, it is reasonable for UDP trafﬁc to be primar-
ily intercepted.
Targeted public DNS services. DNSIntercept targets
DNS trafﬁc sent to not only renowned public DNS ser-
vices but also less prevalent ones. Similar to our ﬁndings
of Global analysis, the interception ratio for renowned
public resolvers is signiﬁcantly higher. For instance,
27.9% UDP-based DNS packets sent to Google are inter-
cepted, the ratio being 9.8% for our in-house EDU DNS.
DNS RR Types. We ﬁnd that A-type requests are slightly
preferred to be intercepted, possibly because it’s the most
common RR type. Meanwhile, we notice in Table 5 that
for Request replication, clients receive no in-band re-
sponses of CNAME, NS or MX-type requests. We speculate
that on-path devices, while replicating requests, block re-
sponses of the three RR types from public DNS services,
reiterating the unethical nature of the interception behav-
ior.
TLD of requested domain. Due to the extra time over-
head introduced by inspecting requested domain names,
it is unlikely that on-path devices specify certain domains
and merely intercept requests of them. Shown in Table 6,
the ratio of intercepted DNS requests does not change
much for domains under different TLDs.
Case Study.
In total, we ﬁnd 61 ASes out of 356
(17.13%) are problematic. In Table 7, we list the top ﬁve
ASes from which most DNS requests (292K in total) are
sent by the client. As our clients are mainly from China,
the top 5 ASes belong to three largest Chinese ISPs. We
ﬁnd that ASes of China Mobile have signiﬁcantly higher
interception ratio than ASes of other Chinese ISPs. Re-
garding alternative resolvers, they are mostly locating in
the same AS as their clients. However, we ﬁnd that they
may also locate in a different AS of the same ISP (e.g.,
AS56046 in Table 7).
