### Environment Details
- **Apache Airflow Version**: 1.10.12
- **Kubernetes Version**: 1.18.6

### Issue Description
**Observed Behavior**:
- Airflow is running in a Kubernetes cluster using the `KubernetesExecutor`.
- When attempting to run a task on demand within a DAG (e.g., by selecting "Ignore all dependencies"), the following error message is displayed:
  ```
  Only works with the Celery or Kubernetes executors, sorry.
  ```

**Expected Behavior**:
- The task should be executed successfully.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Ensure that Airflow is configured to use the `KubernetesExecutor`.
2. Create or open an existing DAG.
3. Attempt to run a task on demand by selecting "Ignore all dependencies".
4. Observe the error message: "Only works with the Celery or Kubernetes executors, sorry."

### Additional Information
- This issue occurs despite the fact that the `KubernetesExecutor` is being used, which should support on-demand task execution.
