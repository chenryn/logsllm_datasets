User: How to build a scalable web application architecture? Please analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the existing web application architecture, and propose improvements.
Assistant: There are three main types of existing web application architectures: 1. Traditional single-tier architecture: UI, business logic, and database access are all deployed on the same server, which is suitable for small-scale systems, but the disadvantage is poor scalability. 2. Layered architecture: The system is divided into multiple layers, such as the browser layer, web server layer, application server layer, and database server layer. Each layer interacts through interfaces, which is suitable for small and medium-sized systems, but the call chain is long , the communication overhead is large. 3. Microservice architecture: split the system into multiple small, independent services, each service is independently deployed, independently expanded, and independent of each other. The advantage is that it has good scalability, but it is difficult to develop and deploy, and issues such as communication between services and business splitting need to be considered. In order to build a scalable web application architecture, the following measures can be taken: 1. Microservice-based architecture: split the system into multiple small, independent services, and interact through lightweight communication protocols (such as HTTP/RESTful) , to achieve loose coupling between services. 2. Adopt business domain-driven design (DDD): divide the business of the system into independent business domains, encapsulate the domain objects in the service, and improve the scalability and maintainability of the system. 3. Introduce API gateway: Unified management and aggregation of services through API gateway, decoupling client and back-end services, and improving system security and scalability. 4. Use asynchronous communication mechanism: By introducing mechanisms such as message queues and distributed messages, decoupling and asynchronous processing between services are realized, and the scalability and fault tolerance of the system are improved. 5. Application load balancing: By introducing load balancing, the traffic is distributed to multiple service nodes to improve the availability and scalability of the system.
