Abstract. In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of
malicious traﬃc generated by mobile devices using Deep Packet Inspec-
tion (DPI) records and security event logs from a large US based cellu-
lar provider network. Our analysis reveals that 0.17 % of mobile devices
in the cellular network are aﬀected by security threats. This propor-
tion, while small, is orders of magnitude higher than the last reported
(in 2013) infection rate of 0.0009 %. We also perform a detailed compari-
son of infection rates of various mobile platforms and show that platforms
deemed to be more secure by common opinion such as BlackBerry and
iOS are not as safe as we think. However, Android still remains the most
aﬀected platform with an infection rate of 0.39 %. We present a detailed
discussion of the top threat families targeting mobile devices observed in
our dataset. Lastly, we characterize the aggregate network footprint of
malicious and benign traﬃc in the cellular network and show that sta-
tistical network features can be used to distinguish between these traﬃc
classes.
1 Introduction
The pervasive use of mobile devices such as smartphones to access an array of
personal and ﬁnancial information makes them rich targets for malware writ-
ers and attackers. Studies have revealed threats and attacks unique to mobile
platforms, such as SMS and phone call interception malware [1]. The claims
about prevalence of mobile malware were recently disputed when Lever et. al [2]
showed that mobile malware appears only in a tiny fraction (0.0009 %) of devices
in their dataset, indicating that mobile application markets are providing ade-
quate security for mobile device users. However, the work in [2] failed to provide
a comprehensive view of malicious network traﬃc since the analysis was limited
to threats which issue DNS requests to known malicious domains. Also, [2] did
not quantify the prevalence of speciﬁc types of threats aﬀecting the network in
their characterization study.

In this paper, we performed a detailed characterization of malicious traﬃc gen-
erated by mobile devices using deep-packet ﬂow records and security event logs
from a major US-based cellular network. Our analysis revealed that 0.17 % of over
2 million devices in the cellular network triggered security alerts. This fraction,
while still small, is orders of magnitude higher than the previous infection rate
reported in [2] and is in agreement with recent direct infection rate measurements
focusing on the Android platform [3]. This alarming infection rate calls for a more
careful and thorough study of malicious traﬃc in the mobile ecosystems.
A second area of our focus deals with the problem of ‘detecting’ malicious
hosts/URLs. Previous studies such as [4,5] treat this as a supervised learning
problem where a classiﬁer learns on a combination of DNS, WHOIS, lexical, and
other features associated with a given host to decide whether it is malicious or
benign with high accuracy. Other studies such as [6,7] exclusively utilize lexical
features to achieve similar goals. A diﬀerent approach, Nazca [8], was proposed
recently to detect malware distribution networks by tracking web requests asso-
ciated with malware downloads and installations.
Instead of focusing on features associated with the malware or hosts (e.g.,
URL content, WHOIS, etc.), we examined the network-level statistical features of
traﬃc associated with malicious domains. We observed that there are distinctive
network access patterns that can be leveraged to distinguish between benign and
malicious sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that applies
such network-level features to the malicious host identiﬁcation problem.
The contributions of our work are two-fold:
(a) We provide a large-scale characterization of malicious traﬃc by analyzing
DPI records and security alerts of over 2 million devices. Apart from revealing
higher infection rate, we show that four classes of threats: privacy-leakage,
adware, SIP attacks and trojans - are most prevalent in mobile devices. Also,
we ﬁnd that 0.39 % of Android devices are infected, while the infection rates
of BlackBerry and iOS devices which are commonly considered more secure
are observed to be comparatively high (0.32 % and 0.22 % respectively).
(b) We analyze the aggregate network-level features of user traﬃc for both
malicious and benign domains, and demonstrate that they are suﬃciently
distinct. This allows us to build a machine learning classiﬁer that identi-
ﬁes malicious domains utilizing statistical properties of network traﬃc. We
believe that this opens up an interesting direction for detection of unknown
malicious domains.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview
of our datasets and methodology. In Sect. 3 we present the ﬁndings of our charac-
terization study of mobile threats. Section 4 describes the nature of network foot-
prints of malicious traﬃc. Section 5 concludes the paper.
2 Data Summary and Methodology
Our dataset, collected at a distribution site operated by a US cellular service
provider, is multiple terabytes in size and logs HTTP activities of over two million

DNS requests seen to known malicious domains
(a) The HTTP request header contains a known malicious
user agent string or URI

information through a HTTP header or URI

(d) DNS request to a known malicious domain (Utilizes a
diﬀerent set of malicious domains from IDS-1)
(e) Known malicious behavior. Eg. Attempt to trigger a

AV-1
Known malware detected on a device through a signature
subscribers for a week-long period in summer 2013. What makes the dataset more
interesting is the associated security alert logs generated by commercial systems
deployed in the network.
Speciﬁcally, the following traces are contained in our dataset:
– Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Records: These records log HTTP activity of
subscribers in the network and contain ﬂow level information associated with
each HTTP request, such as, the timestamp, duration, bytes transmitted in
each direction, source IP address, URL, and User Agent of the ﬂow.
– Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Anti-Virus (AV) Alert Logs: These logs
contain threatname (usually vendor speciﬁc), subscriber IP address, timestamp,
destination HTTP domain, and destination port of the alerted activity.
– IP Assignment Records: These records map dynamically assigned IP addresses
to anonymized subscriber device IDs.
– VirusTotal, McAfee scan results: We performed additional scans on certain
domains and IP’s in the IDS and AV logs to obtain additional information
about the threats and number of malware detection engines ﬂagging it as
positive (malicious).
We perform two processing tasks to help characterize malicious events in the
carrier’s network. We describe each of these tasks in greater detail below.
(a) Building Ground Truth for Malicious Traﬃc: As mentioned earlier, the car-
rier deploys two separate commercial IDS’s in its premises. Each IDS pas-
sively monitors diﬀerent characteristics of traﬃc and ﬂags security events
without initiating any ‘block’ actions. We utilize logs produced by these
appliances in our characterization study. We also use records logged at AV
scanners deployed at select end-client devices as an additional auxiliary
source of security evidence. Table 1 describes the alert triggering mecha-
nism of these IDS and AV systems. We collect IP’s and URL’s associated

with the alert events and submit them to commercial URL scanners such
as VirusTotal [9] to eliminate false positives and to gather detailed informa-
tion about the threats associated with these alerts. In addition, we manually
group the most prominent threats in the network into four general cate-
gories or “Threat classes”as: Trojans, Privacy leakage threats, Potentially
Unwanted Applications(PUA) and SIP threats based on the common char-
acteristics and infecting behavior of the threats.
(b) Identifying Devices and Platforms: The events in our malicious traﬃc ground
truth database could have been triggered by either mobile devices such as
smartphones and tablets or laptops and desktops that connect to the cellu-
lar network via hotspots/modem devices. We were provided with the regis-
tered make, model and operating system information for about half of the
anonymized subscribers in the trace. For the other subscribers, we infer the
device type, make, and OS type using the User-Agent ﬁelds from their DPI
records with the help of an in-house tool1. The devices in our alert datasets
are then classiﬁed manually as one of the four general categories: phones,
tablets, hotspots/modems and other devices.
3 Characterizing Mobile Threats
3.1 Prevalence of Malicious Traﬃc
As described earlier, we do not limit our characterization to web traﬃc gener-
ating DNS requests to malicious domains. Instead, we include non-HTTP mali-
cious traﬃc such as VoIP security events occurring on ports 5060 and 5061 and
a number of security events on non-standard ports such as 8080/8090 in our
study. Thus, we capture a more complete view of malicious traﬃc in the cellular
network.

unknown device to make an estimate of its make, model and platform.

(a) Cross-Device Threats
(b) Mobile Only Threats
Fig. 2. Infection Eﬀectiveness of Threats
In the dataset, 0.23 % of devices were observed to trigger security alerts
and 73.2 % of these events originated from mobile devices such as smartphones
and tablets while the rest are triggered by devices behind wireless hotspots or
modems, and hence cannot be uniquely identiﬁed as being mobile or non-mobile.
This puts the lower bound of the overall infection rate of mobile devices at 0.17 %,
which is orders of magnitude higher than those reported in the most recent
work by Lever et al. [2]. Also, our observed infection rate is in agreement with
the reported rate in a recent study focusing on direct measurement of Android
malware infection rates [3]. We note that our notion of ‘infection’ is similar
to that of [2]. We mark a device as infected when we observe a security alert
originating from it. This is reasonable since (a) The IDS systems in the network
are passively monitoring threats and do not engage in ‘blocking’ malicious traﬃc,
(b) We only use alerts which are known true positives and (c) This allows us to
do a one-to-one comparison of infection rates with previous work.
Further, we rank the individual infected devices based on the total number
of security alerts generated by them over the course of the week, and found that
the top 20 % of the devices account for more than 80 % of the security alerts.
Interestingly, the top 20 % of the infected devices primarily consisted of Android
and iOS based phones/tablets.
Based on the methodology described in Sect. 2, we extracted detailed infor-
mation about the threat associated with each security event by leveraging com-
mercial virus-scanning tools, and through manual inspections. We found 327
unique threats in our malicious traﬃc groundtruth dataset that spans over the
course of one week. After performing device classiﬁcation, we further categorized
these 327 threats into three classes with 75 % conﬁdence intervals as follows:
(a) mobile-only threats that infect mobile devices (b) non-mobile threats that
infect non-mobile devices, and (c) cross-device threats that infect both types of
devices. Figure 1a characterizes the macroscopic alerting behavior of the three
classes of threats in the network. The x-axis in this graph represents the top n %
of threats in terms of the total number of alerts generated. In general, a small
fraction of threats (5–15 %) are responsible for a major proportion (over 80 %) of
the observed alert traﬃc. However, we note that mobile threats in general tend
to generate less number of alerts than their non-mobile counterparts. This might

indicate that attackers have adapted mobile malware to be stealthier and harder
to detect on the network. Moreover, some mobile-speciﬁc threats (e.g., privacy
leakage) generate less network footprints and hence trigger less number of alerts.
Exploring this further, we see that the number of alerts observed to be gen-
erated per threat is a function of the threat family (e.g. botnet, data leakage,
etc.) and the number of devices aﬀected by the threat. Privacy leakage threats
such as threats responsible for leaking IMEI or location information from a
device generally do not generate as many alerts as devices aﬀected by a botnet
threat (as shown in Fig. 1b). A ‘zombie’ bot device makes regular call-backs to
command and control servers for downloading instructions, data exﬁltration and
so on, hence generating a much larger footprint in the security alert logs. This
implies that mining alert logs generated by network access activities could be
eﬀective in early detection and prevention of botnet-like threats. However, sim-
ilar methodology will be ineﬀective for other threats, such as data leakage, that
leave very little footprints.
3.2 Top Mobile Threats
Next, we examine the threats that infected the most number of mobile devices.
Malware writers often aim to infect as many devices as possible in order to
maximize their ﬁnancial or other gains. Therefore we use the number of devices
aﬀected by a threat to quantify its success in the cellular network.
Figure 2 plots the infection eﬀectiveness of two categories of threats: cross-
device threats and mobile-only threats, respectively. The x-axis plots threat id in
decreasing order of rank based on the total number of devices aﬀected (i.e., the
ﬁrst threat id aﬀects the most number of devices). Notice from this graph that
only a few threats are able to successfully aﬀect a large number of devices (either
