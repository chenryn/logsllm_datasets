Hello, This is a step by step of what I remember happening leading up to the
duplication of the file.
Opened a Wordpress theme package in Atom, when I was finished I closed that
window (I did not close atom).  
Selected 'Open...' from the menu and opened a different project.  
Opened a few pages and made some edits.  
Opened settings and saw that a theme was out of date so I updated it.  
Pasted some info from a website into a file and saved it.
It was when hitting 'control s' that I noticed a new file appear (page.php):
![atom-
files](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/775993/4430240/52a763d8-4625-11e4-9b1a-d94cf6d6feea.png)
This file was from the previous Wordpress project and it was now in the new
project.  
I can't recall if I had been editing that file or if it was open when I closed
the previous project.
I have since upgraded to version 0.132.0 (The request to upgrade was in the
menu) So I guess the version was the one before this.  
The theme I updated was Monokai (https://atom.io/packages/monokai).
