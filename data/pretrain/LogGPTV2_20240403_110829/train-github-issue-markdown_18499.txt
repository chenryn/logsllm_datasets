Subject: Detailed Account of File Duplication Incident in Atom

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to provide a step-by-step account of the events leading up to an unexpected file duplication issue I encountered while using Atom.

1. **Opening Initial Project**: I opened a WordPress theme package within Atom for some modifications. Upon completion, I closed this specific project window but kept the Atom application running.
   
2. **Switching Projects**: From the main menu, I selected 'Open...' and proceeded to open a different project unrelated to the initial WordPress theme.

3. **Making Edits**: In this new project, I opened several files and made necessary adjustments.

4. **Updating Settings**: During my work, I accessed the settings and noticed that one of the themes, specifically Monokai (available at https://atom.io/packages/monokai), required an update. I proceeded with updating it.

5. **Pasting Information**: I then copied content from a website and pasted it into one of the files in the current project, saving the changes by pressing 'Control + S'.

6. **File Duplication Discovery**: It was at this point that I observed the creation of a new file named `page.php` appearing in my project directory. This file originated from the previously opened WordPress theme project. I am uncertain whether I had been actively editing this particular file or if it was simply open when I switched projects.

7. **Version Upgrade**: Since experiencing this issue, I have updated Atom to version 0.132.0, as prompted by the software itself. Therefore, the version I was using prior to the incident must have been the immediate predecessor to 0.132.0.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or clarification regarding this matter.

Best regards,
