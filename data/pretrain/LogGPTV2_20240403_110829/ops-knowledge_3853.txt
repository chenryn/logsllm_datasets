User: We need to encrypt some sensitive data, but try not to affect the current system performance, please propose a solution.
Assistant: An efficient encryption scheme is to use hardware accelerators to handle encryption operations. Hardware accelerators can provide high-speed encryption and decryption functions, and can reduce system load. In addition, the use of symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES can improve encryption efficiency, and AES can easily achieve hardware acceleration on today's computers. In addition, storage encryption technology can be used. Storage encryption technology can encrypt data on the disk, so as to ensure that the data is safe when stored on the disk. This scheme does not affect computing performance because encryption and decryption operations are only performed when the file is read and written. Finally, data can also be encrypted at the network layer using security protocols such as SSL/TLS. This ensures that data is secure while in transit. On modern computers, SSL/TLS has no significant impact on network performance.
