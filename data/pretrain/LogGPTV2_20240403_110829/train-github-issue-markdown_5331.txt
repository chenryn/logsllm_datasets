Hi @mpdehaan,

Here are the steps for the upcoming release:

1. **Bump the specfile** to reflect the new version.
2. **Review the man pages** to ensure that any new parameters or changes are documented.
3. For good measure, run the following commands:
   ```sh
   touch VERSION
   make docs
   ```
4. **Tag the release as 0.7**.
5. **Ping me** once the tagging is complete so I can start working on the corresponding Fedora update.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
