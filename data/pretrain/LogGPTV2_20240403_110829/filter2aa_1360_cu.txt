The results appear similar to the following.

This script should query the username of intekechniques against numerous online sendees. It does not present 
any results when complete, but did locate and store valuable data. To view the results, type the following.
Now that the module is loaded, we can add any input desired. Since this module queries usernames, we will add 
our target of "inteltechniques" with the following command. Note that SOURCE is uppercase, which is required.
This provides the detailed description, and whether the utility requires an API key or other dependencies. It also 
confirms we have not installed the module. We will execute this option later in the chapter. For now, we must 
set up our first investigation.
Before we can conduct any research within this program, we must create a workspace. A workspace is a container 
that will isolate your work from one investigation to another. Think of a workspace as a case file. You may have 
a stack of cases on your desk, each with its own folder. All of your work on a case stays within the folder 
associated. Workspaces are similar. You should create a new workspace for each investigation. They can be 
deleted later or preserved for additional work. You can type workspaces list at any time to see the currently 
used workspaces. For now, we will create a new workspace tided OSINT by executing die command of 
workspaces create OSINT.
After creation, you will automatically begin using the new workspace. If you have created more than one 
workspace, such as one tided OSINT2, you can switch to it by typing workspaces load 0SINT2. You might 
have a workspace for every target suspect or a single workspace for an entire case. Each situation will be unique. 
Now that you have a space created, we can begin. Let's start with a very simple yet powerful query, using the 
Profiler module previously mentioned. First, we must install the module with the following command within 
Recon-ng.

Let's conduct another example within a different module. First, we must leave our current module by typing 
back. This returns us to our workspace. Next, install four additional modules with the following commands.

In just a few seconds, we queried dozens of online services and immediately received only the three which 
contained the presence of our target username. This demonstrates the ability to save a substantial amount of 
time by using Recon-ng. If you were tasked to locate online profiles of ten suspects, this could be completed in 
a few minutes. Let's repeat the process, but with another username, with the following commands.

Let's reflect on how this can be beneficial. Assume that you are investigating numerous websites. Recon-ng 
provides dozens of utilities which automate queries and provides immediate information. Magnify this y tens 
or hundreds of domains, profiles, or other target data, and you have an easy way to replicate several hours o
s, while submitting show contacts afterward displays the 
email addresses identified. Each of these addresses are now
social-engineer.be 
social-engineer.ch 
social-engineer.com 
social-engineer.de 
social-engineer.dev 
social-engineer.info
These are all new leads that should be analyzed later. We could now repeat our previous module execution o 
bing_domain_web and google_site_web to likely grow our list of hosts substantially. This is a good time to pause 
and consider what is happening here. As we find data, Recon-ng stores it within our workspace. Ever} time ue 
conduct a new search, or repeat a previous search, all of the new data is appended. This prevents us rom 
documenting everything that we locate because Recon-ng is keeping good notes for us. This can allow us to 
collect an amount of data otherwise impossible to manage manually. Let's move on to individual contacts.
Typing show contacts will display any contacts stored within the current workspace. You likely do not ha\e 
any, so let's add some. First, type back to make sure you are out of the previous module. Next, oa ano er 
module with modules load pgp_search. This will scan all of the stored domains that we have locate an scare 
for any email addresses associated with public PGP keys within those domains. We have not set a source 
this module, but you likely already have some ready for you. In a previous example, you searche socl 
engineer.org within other top-level domains and received numerous results. If you type input wit in is 
module, you should see those same domains listed. This is because Recon-ng is constantly storing found ata 
and making it available for future use. If we type run, this list will be searched, but no results will be foun . i otc 
that this list does not possess our target domain of social-engineer.org, and only the additional names ou 
previously. Therefore, you may wish to remove these sources, and then add a new source, with the o owing 
commands.
Typing run and striking enter executes the process, 
results. The following is the partial output with new t* 
stored in your workspace, ready for the next round of research.
notifies us 38 total (15 new) hosts found, which indicates that Bing found more hosts than Google, and 
Google found 15 hosts that we did not have in our collection from Bing. Since Recon-ng can parse out 
duplicates, we should have a list of unique hosts with a combined effort from both Google and Bing. Typing 
show hosts will display all of them. Below is a small portion.
Next, let's type back to leave the current module and then modules load brute_suffix to load our next demo. 
Since there is no domain set as our source for this module, we will add one with options set SOURCE social­
engineer, org. There are many top-level domains (TLDs) aside from .com and .org. Executing run will scour 
the various TLDs such as .net, .tv, and others. After completion, typing show domains again will display our 
updated set of target addresses ready for further searching. In this example, I was notified that 11 additional 
domains were located, including the following.

This chapter explains only a small portion of the capabilities of Recon-ng. Please consider revisiting the modules 
listed at the beginning and experiment with the execution of each. Overall, it would be very difficult to break 
the application, and any errors received are harmless. You will receive best results by requesting API keys from 
the services which require them. The "Info" screen of each Recon-ng module displays any requirements within 
the "Required Keys" field. Many API keys are free and open new possibilities. Overall, an entire book could be 
written about this application alone. The goal of this section was simply to familiarize you with the program and 
demonstrate the power of automated queries.
This seems like a good time to back away, create a report, and start a new set of actions. The following commands 
will back out of our current module; install the reporting feature; instruct Recon-ng that we want to use the 
reporting tool; mandate a graphical html (web) template be used; set the "Customer” as IntelTechniques; set the 
"Creator" as M.Bazzell; and execute the process.
Note the output after the final command. It identifies that the report is complete, and provides the storage 
location. Since I am running Recon-ng from my OSINT virtual machine, the default location is —/.recon- 
ng/workspaces/OSINT/results.html. Therefore, I can open the home folder on my desktop; double-click the 
".recon-ng" folder; double-click the "workspaces" folder; double-click the "OSINT’ folder, and then open the 
"results" file. Please note you must have "Show Hidden Files" option enabled from within the preferences menu 
of the Files application. Figure 27.06 displays the partial file from this example. Note that the Domains, Hosts, 
and Contacts sections are not expanded, but contain a lot of information. At the bottom of this file, the "Created 
by", date, and time clearly identify these report details.
If you would like more information about Recon-ng, please visit the official Github page at 
https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng. From there, you can join a dedicated Slack group in order to 
participate in group discussions about errors, features, and overall usage.
work. In another scenario, you are investigating a list of potential email addresses connected to a case. Entering 
these into Recon-ng allows you to execute your searches across all accounts. 'The effort to check one address is 
the same to check thousands. This impressive capability is only a small fraction of what can be done with this 
application.
Hopefully this demonstration explained the usage of Recon-ng. Executing exit in the window closes everything,
