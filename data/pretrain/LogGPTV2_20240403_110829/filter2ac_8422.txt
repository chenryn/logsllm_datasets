titleblackhat:eu-21 Your Trash Kernel Bug, My Precious 0-day
The advance of kernel fuzzing techniques significantly benefits the discovery of kernel bugs. According to our statistics on Syzbot, Syzkaller has already unveiled more than 2,000 kernel bug reports on Linux over the past two years. From the security analysts' perspectives, a kernel bug report that demonstrates memory corruption usually receives more attention than those exhibiting only WARNING or NULL pointer dereference. It is simply because memory corruption is typically the prerequisite for exploiting the Linux kernel and obtaining unauthorized root privilege. In this talk, we will introduce a new technical method to turn those bugs with seemingly low-risk into memory corruption vulnerabilities. We will demonstrate how we leverage the proposed technique to escalate Linux kernel non-security bugs into exploitable vulnerabilities. Along with our demonstration, we will show unprecedented exploitability against broadly-adopted Centos and many Centos-based distros like TencentOS and Alibaba Cloud Linux OS. Last but not least, we will release our technical approach as a tool for the community to thoroughly assess a kernel bug's severity and exploitability.
