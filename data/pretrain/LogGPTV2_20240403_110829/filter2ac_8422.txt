**Title:** Your Trash Kernel Bug, My Precious 0-day

**Abstract:**

The advancement of kernel fuzzing techniques has significantly enhanced the discovery of kernel bugs. According to our analysis of Syzbot data, Syzkaller has uncovered over 2,000 kernel bug reports in Linux over the past two years. From a security analyst's perspective, kernel bug reports that demonstrate memory corruption tend to receive more attention than those that only show warnings or null pointer dereferences. This is because memory corruption is often a critical prerequisite for exploiting the Linux kernel and gaining unauthorized root access.

In this presentation, we will introduce a novel technical approach that transforms seemingly low-risk kernel bugs into memory corruption vulnerabilities. We will demonstrate how our method can escalate non-security-related kernel bugs into exploitable vulnerabilities. Our demonstration will include unprecedented exploitability against widely-used CentOS and other CentOS-based distributions such as TencentOS and Alibaba Cloud Linux OS.

Finally, we will release our technical approach as a tool for the community, enabling thorough assessment of the severity and exploitability of kernel bugs. This tool will help security researchers and developers better understand and mitigate potential risks associated with kernel vulnerabilities.
