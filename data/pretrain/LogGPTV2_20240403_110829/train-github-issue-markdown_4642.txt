Howdy!
This issue cropped up (or at least I noticed it) around 0.199, but it remains
in 0.200.
I have one deprecation warning (which sticks around even in safe mode):
    your local styles.less file
      /Users/tylersticka/Dropbox (Personal)/Atom/styles.less
      Style elements within text editors using the atom-text-editor::shadow selector or the .atom-text-editor.less file extension. If you want to target overlay elements, target them directly or as descendants of atom-overlay elements.
If I click that error, I am taken to what appears to be an empty file:

If I go to the Atom menu and select "Open Your Stylesheet," this is what it
looks like:
    /*
     * Your Stylesheet
     *
     * This stylesheet is loaded when Atom starts up and is reloaded automatically
     * when it is changed.
     *
     * If you are unfamiliar with LESS, you can read more about it here:
     * http://www.lesscss.org
     */
    .tree-view {
    }
    atom-text-editor {
    }
    atom-text-editor .cursor {
    }
I thought maybe I had _inherited_ this stylesheet from an older version, so I
tried commenting out everything within it... but the deprecation warning
remains.
(Apologies if this issue is duplicated, I swear I searched for it before
creating a this one!)
**Edit:** I should also mention that I have my `.atom` directory symbolically
linked to Dropbox (if you're wondering why my paths aren't simply
`/Users/tylersticka/.atom`).
