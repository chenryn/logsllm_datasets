User: Tornado web framework seems to expose a method RequestHandler.prepare() which is called before the actual handler method. I was wondering if there's a similar method which is called after the handler ?
Assistant: Starting Tornado 2.2 now you can override RequestHandler.on_finish for post-request processing.
