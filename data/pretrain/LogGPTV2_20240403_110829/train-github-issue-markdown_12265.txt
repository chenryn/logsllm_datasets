I'm using Next.js framework and react-player component to play some music on
my site. Everything is good until I navigate to the second page. Then the
music player stops and when I go back to the first page, the music starts
playing again.
While I want the music to not be interrupted by going to different pages and
be an upstream component that I can change the music files from different
pages.
What way do you suggest to this case?
