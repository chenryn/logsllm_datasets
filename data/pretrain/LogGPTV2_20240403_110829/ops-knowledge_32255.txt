User: I'm using Node-Red, hosted on a Raspberry Pi for an IoT project.
How do I trigger a Python script that is on the raspi from Node-Red? I want to run a script that updates the text on an Adafruit LCD shield which is sitting on the Pi
Should I be looking to expose the Python script as a web service somehow?
I'm using a Raspberry Pi B+
Assistant: I hope you have installed red-node along with Python.
If not, install it using following either in Power shell or CMD:
npm install -g node-red-contrib-python3-function
After starting node-red, you can find pythonshell node in Node Panel of node-red.
Drag and Drop it and double click it to get "node properties" panel,
Enter Python.exe path in Name and Python File in Py File and click on Done.
Have and msg-payload node connected to it and Deploy.
Click on PythonShell node input, you will get your python program executed and displayed in output.
