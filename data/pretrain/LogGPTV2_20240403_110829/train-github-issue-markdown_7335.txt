# Description
In Calling Tasks:
> You can also inspect the exception and traceback if the task raised an
> exception, in fact result.get() will propagate any errors by default:
    >>> res = add.delay(2)
    >>> res.get(timeout=1)
This example is not working as described because `add.delay(2)` results in the
following error before the user is able to call `res.get(timeout=1)`:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "", line 1, in 
      File "/home/abd/python/celery/env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/celery/app/task.py", line 425, in delay
        return self.apply_async(args, kwargs)
      File "/home/abd/python/celery/env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/celery/app/task.py", line 530, in apply_async
        check_arguments(*(args or ()), **(kwargs or {}))
    TypeError: add() missing 1 required positional argument: 'y'
I suppose `check_arguments()` is a new function?
# Suggestions
Change the example from:
    >>> res = add.delay(2)
    >>> res.get(timeout=1)
To an integer and string addition:
    >>> res = add.delay(2, '2')
    >>> res.get(timeout=1)
This way `res = add.delay(2, '2')` won't raise `TypeError: add() missing 1
required positional argument: 'y'`. And `res.get(timeout=1)` will propagate
the following exception:
