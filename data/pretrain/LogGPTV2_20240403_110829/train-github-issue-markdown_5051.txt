In a simple component with an Output as follows:
    @Output() final trigger = new LazyEventEmitter();
This error is thrown:  
"Bad state: Stream has already been listened to."
Under the hood, the component uses a LazyEventEmitter (which is just a wrapper
of Stream/Stream Controller), but it is **not broadcast**. Changing the
controller to instantiate a broadcast stream fixes this, but up until now, we
have been able to expect only one subscription from Angular framework.
    @Output() final trigger = new LazyEventEmitter.broadcast();
