# Digital Active Self-Defense

## Introduction
- **Digital Threats**: Despite the increasing use of security technologies, digital threats persist. These include issues related to confidentiality, integrity, availability, and copyright.
- **Hardening and Reaction**: Many solutions exist in the information security field, but laws often fail to address certain types of activities. The natural temptation is to fight back against attackers, but there are few solutions that use active countermeasures.
- **Active Defense**: This is an interesting field of research and development.

### Current Threats
- **Known Limitations for Defense Technologies**: Even with advanced security measures, vulnerabilities remain.
- **External Threats**: Firewalls, proxies, and hardened services can help, but ethical hackers, corporate spies, and cyber terrorists still find ways to breach defenses.
- **Internal Threats**: Easier and faster access by trainees, outsourced personnel, and employees can also pose significant risks.

### From Hardening to Reaction
- **Blocking Evil Traffic**: Routers, firewalls, and proxies can be used to block malicious traffic, but attackers often find ways around these defenses.
- **Countermeasure Technologies**: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can detect attacks, but the delay between detection and response can allow some packets to reach the victim.

### Countermeasure Problems
- **Detection and Response Delay**: The time between detection and response is not instantaneous, which can lead to partial or complete attack success.
- **Examples of Problems**: SQL-Worms and multiple-source attacks highlight the challenges of timely and effective responses.

### Prevention and Countermeasure
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Firewalls**: Combining IDS and firewalls can help prevent attacks, but this is a new concept that needs further development.
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Network IPS (NIPS) and Host IPS (HIPS) offer inline detection and prevention, including bait and switch honeypots and sandboxing techniques.

### Prevention and Deception
- **Diverting Evil Traffic**: Techniques like "Building an Early Warning System in a Service Provider Network" and bait and switch honeypots can divert malicious traffic to a fake network.
- **Example**: When an attacker's IP is detected, all future actions from that IP are redirected to a deception network.

### Diversion and Drawbacks
- **Concept Limitations**: While the bait and switch approach is innovative, it has limitations such as single points of failure, evasion techniques, and denial of service through IP spoofing.

### Attacks Against IPS
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: IDS and IPS are vulnerable to state table attacks and packet bombing.
- **Ruleset Abuses**: Evasion techniques and zero-day exploits can bypass IDS/IPS rules.
- **Spoofing and Distributed Attacks**: Coordinated attacks from multiple sources can overwhelm and deceive IPS systems.

### Active Defense
- **Usual Methods**: Blocking incoming traffic, applying rate limitations, and diverting traffic using bait and switch technologies.
- **Aggressive Methods**: Consideration of more aggressive self-defense and counterstrike measures to disable, destroy, or control the attacker.

### Legal Issues
- **Digital Self-Defense**: The concept of digital self-defense is analogous to physical self-defense, where force is used to protect property.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Necessity**: No other adequate alternatives.
  - **Proportionality**: The response must be reasonable and proportional to the threat.
  - **Unlawful Threat**: The threat must be unlawful.

### Proportional Response
- **Classification of Attacks**: A classification system is needed to determine appropriate responses.
- **Challenges**: Subjectivity and interpretation make it difficult to define proportional responses.

### No Adequate Alternatives
- **Proving Necessity**: It can be challenging to prove that no other alternatives were available, especially given the many security solutions available.
- **Information Warfare**: Legal considerations in information warfare are complex and not fully recognized by international conventions.

### Technical Considerations
- **Striking Back**:
  - **Identify Tools and Sources**: Use IDS, logs, and network captures to identify the source of the attack.
  - **Avoid Spoofing**: Ensure that the source is genuine to avoid attacking innocent parties.
  - **Decision Making**: Use white lists and black lists to determine the destination of counterstrikes.
  - **Risk of Spoofing**: Attacking innocents due to spoofed IP addresses is a significant risk.

### Summary
- **Introduction**: Overview of digital threats, hardening, and active defense.
- **Legal Issues**: Discussion of the legal aspects of digital self-defense.
- **Technical Considerations**: Detailed exploration of technical methods and their limitations.
- **Conclusions**: Final thoughts on the effectiveness and challenges of active defense in the digital realm.
