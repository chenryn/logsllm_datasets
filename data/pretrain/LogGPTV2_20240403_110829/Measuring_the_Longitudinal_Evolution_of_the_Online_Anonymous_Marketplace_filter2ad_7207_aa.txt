Abstract
February 2011 saw the emergence of Silk Road, the ﬁrst
successful online anonymous marketplace, in which buy-
ers and sellers could transact with anonymity properties
far superior to those available in alternative online or of-
ﬂine means of commerce. Business on Silk Road, pri-
marily involving narcotics trafﬁcking, rapidly boomed,
and competitors emerged. At the same time, law enforce-
ment did not sit idle, and eventually managed to shut
down Silk Road in October 2013 and arrest its operator.
Far from causing the demise of this novel form of com-
merce, the Silk Road take-down spawned an entire, dy-
namic, online anonymous marketplace ecosystem, which
has continued to evolve to this day. This paper presents a
long-term measurement analysis of a large portion of this
online anonymous marketplace ecosystem, including 16
different marketplaces, over more than two years (2013–
2015). By using long-term measurements, and combin-
ing our own data collection with publicly available pre-
vious efforts, we offer a detailed understanding of the
growth of the online anonymous marketplace ecosystem.
We are able to document the evolution of the types of
goods being sold, and assess the effect (or lack thereof)
of adversarial events, such as law enforcement operations
or large-scale frauds, on the overall size of the economy.
We also provide insights into how vendors are diversi-
fying and replicating across marketplaces, and how ven-
dor security practices (e.g., PGP adoption) are evolving.
These different aspects help us understand how tradi-
tional, physical-world criminal activities are developing
an online presence, in the same manner traditional com-
merce diversiﬁed online in the 1990s.

Introduction
In February 2011, a new Tor hidden service [16], called
“Silk Road,” opened its doors. Silk Road portrayed it-
self as an online anonymous marketplace, where buyers
and sellers could meet and conduct electronic commerce
transactions in a manner similar to the Amazon Market-
place, or the ﬁxed price listings of eBay. The key inno-
vation in Silk Road was to guarantee stronger anonymity
properties to its participants than any other online mar-
ketplace. The anonymity properties were achieved by
combining the network anonymity properties of Tor hid-
den services—which make the IP addresses of both the
client and the server unknown to each other and to out-
side observers—with the use of the pseudonymous, de-
centralized Bitcoin electronic payment system [33]. Silk
Road itself did not sell any product, but provided a feed-
back system to rate vendors and buyers, as well as escrow
services (to ensure that transactions were completed to
everybody’s satisfaction) and optional hedging services
(to buffer ﬂuctuations in the value of the bitcoin).
Embolden by the anonymity properties Silk Road pro-
vided, sellers and buyers on Silk Road mostly traded
in contraband and narcotics. While Silk Road was not
the ﬁrst venue to allow people to purchase such goods
online—older forums such at the Open Vendor Database,
or smaller web stores such as the Farmer’s Market pre-
dated it—it was by far the most successful one to date at
the time due to its (perceived) superior anonymity guar-
antees [13]. The Silk Road operator famously declared
in August 2013 in an interview with Forbes, that the
“War on Drugs” had been won by Silk Road and its pa-
trons [18]. While this was an overstatement, the business
model of Silk Road had proven viable enough that com-
petitors, such as Black Market Reloaded, Atlantis, or the
Sheep Marketplace had emerged.
Then,
in early October 2013, Silk Road was shut
down, its operator arrested, and all the money held in es-
crow on the site conﬁscated by law enforcement. Within
the next couple of weeks, reports of Silk Road sellers and
buyers moving to Silk Road’s ex-competitors (chieﬂy,
Sheep Marketplace and Black Market Reloaded) or start-
ing their own anonymous marketplaces started to sur-
face. By early November 2013, a novel incarnation

of Silk Road, dubbed “Silk Road 2.0” was online—set
up by former administrators and vendors of the origi-
nal Silk Road.1 Within a few months, numerous mar-
ketplaces following the same model of offering an on-
line anonymous rendez-vous point for sellers and buy-
ers appeared. These different marketplaces offered var-
ious levels of sophistication, durability and specializa-
tion (drugs, weapons, counterfeits, ﬁnancial accounts,
...). At the same time, marketplaces would often disap-
pear, sometimes due to arrests (e.g., as was the case with
Utopia [19]), sometimes voluntarily (e.g., Sheep Market-
place [34]). In other words, the anonymous online mar-
ketplace ecosystem had evolved signiﬁcantly compared
to the early days when Silk Road was nearly a monopoly.
In this paper, we present our measurements and anal-
ysis of the anonymous marketplace ecosystem over a pe-
riod of two and a half years between 2013 and 2015.
Previous studies either focused on a speciﬁc marketplace
(e.g., Silk Road [13]), or on simply describing high-level
characteristics of certain marketplaces, such as the num-
ber of posted listings at a given point in time [15].
By using long-term measurements, combining our
own data collection with publicly available previous ef-
forts, and validating the completeness of our dataset us-
ing capture and recapture estimation, we offer a much
more detailed understanding of the evolution of the on-
line anonymous marketplace ecosystem.
In particular,
we are able to measure the effect of the Silk Road take-
down on the overall sales volume; how reported “scams”
in some marketplaces dented consumer conﬁdence; how
vendors are diversifying and replicating across market-
places; and how security practices (e.g., PGP adoption)
are evolving. These different aspects paint what we be-
lieve is an accurate picture of how traditional, physical-
world criminal activities are developing an online pres-
ence, in the same manner traditional commerce diversi-
ﬁed online in the 1990s.
We discover several interesting properties. Our analy-
sis of the sales volumes demonstrates that as a whole the
online anonymous marketplace ecosystem appears to be
resilient, on the long term, to adverse events such as law
enforcement take-downs or “exit scams” in which the op-
erators abscond with the money. We also evidence stabil-
ity over time in the types of products being sold and pur-
chased: cannabis-, ecstasy- and cocaine-related products
consistently account for about 70% of all sales. Analyz-
ing vendor characteristics shows a mix of highly special-
ized vendors, who focus on a single product, and sellers
who sell a large number of different products. We also
discover that vendor population has long-tail characteris-
tics: while a few vendors are (or were) highly successful,
the vast majority of vendors grossed less than $10,000

over our entire study interval. This further substantiates
the notion that online anonymous marketplaces are pri-
marily competing with street dealers, in the retail space,
rather than with established criminal organizations which
focus on bulk sales.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides a brief overview of how the various on-
line marketplaces we study operate. Section 3 describes
our measurement methodology and infrastructure. Sec-
tion 4 presents our measurement analysis. We discuss
limitations of our approach and resulting open questions
in Section 5, before introducing the related work in Sec-
tion 6 and ﬁnally concluding in Section 7.
2 Online Anonymous Marketplaces
The sale of contraband and illicit products on the Internet
can probably be traced back to the origins of the Internet
itself, with a number of forums and bulletin board sys-
tems where buyers and sellers could interact.
However, online markets have met with consider-
able developments in sophistication and scale, over the
past six years or so, going from relatively conﬁdential
“classiﬁeds”-type of listings such as on the Open Vendor
Database, to large online anonymous marketplaces. Fol-
lowing the Silk Road blueprint, modern online anony-
mous markets run as Tor hidden services, which gives
participants (marketplace operators and participants such
as buyers and sellers) communication anonymity proper-
ties far superior to those available from alternative solu-
tions (e.g., anonymous hosting); and use pseudonymous
online currencies as payment systems (e.g., Bitcoin [33])
to make it possible to exchange money electronically
without the immediate traceability that conventional pay-
ment systems (wire transfers, or credit card payments)
provide.
The common point between all these marketplaces is
that they actually are not themselves selling contraband.
Instead, they are risk management platforms for partici-
pants in (mostly illegal) transactions. Risk is mitigated
on several levels. First, by abolishing physical inter-
actions between transacting parties, these marketplaces
claim to reduce (or indeed, eliminate) the potential for
physical violence during the transaction.
Second, by providing superior anonymity guarantees
compared to the alternatives, online anonymous market-
places shield – to some degree2 – transaction participants
from law enforcement intervention.
Third, online anonymous marketplaces provide an es-
crow system to prevent ﬁnancial risk. These systems are
very similar in spirit to those developed by electronic
2Physical items still need to be delivered, which is a potential inter-
vention point for law enforcement as shown in documented arrests [4].

were crawled, the time the measurements spanned, and the number of
snapshots that were taken. ∗ denote market sites seized by the police,
† voluntary shutdowns, and ‡ (suspected) fraudulent closures (owners
absconding with escrow money).
Second, we want the scrapes to be complete, instanta-
neous, and frequent. Scrapes that are instantaneous and
complete convey a coherent picture about what is taking
place on the marketplace without doubts about possible
unobserved actions or the inconsistency that may be in-
troduced by time delay. Scraping very often ensures that
we have high precision in dating when actions occurred,
and reduces the chances of missing vendor actions, such
as listing and rapidly de-listing a given item.
Third we want our scraper to be reliable even when the
marketplace that we are measuring is not. Even when a
marketplace is unavailable for hours, the scraper should
hold state and retry to avoid an incomplete capture.
Fourth,
the scraper should be capable of handling
client-side state normally kept by the users browser such
as cookies, and be robust enough to avoid any detection
schemes that might be devised to thwart the scraper. We
attempt to address these design objectives as follows.
Avoiding censorship Before we add a site to the scrap-
ing regimen, we ﬁrst manually inspect it and identify
its layout. We build and use as input to the scraper a
conﬁguration including regular expressions on the URLs
for that particular marketplace. This allows us to avoid
following links that may cause undesirable actions to be
performed such as adding items to a cart, sending mes-
sages or logging out. We also provide as input to the
scraper a session cookie that we obtain by manually log-
ging into the marketplace and solving a CAPTCHA; and
parameters such as the maximum desired scraping rate.
In addition to being careful about what to request from
a marketplace, we obfuscate how we request content. For
each page request, the scraper randomly selects a Tor cir-
cuit out of 20 pre-built circuits. This strategy ensures that
the requests are being distributed over several rendez-
vous points in the Tor network. This helps prevent trig-
gering anti-DDoS heuristics certain marketplaces use.5
This strategy also provides redundancy in the event that
