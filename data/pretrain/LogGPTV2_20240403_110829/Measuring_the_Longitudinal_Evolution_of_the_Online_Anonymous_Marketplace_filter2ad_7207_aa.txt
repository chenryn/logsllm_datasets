## Abstract

In February 2011, Silk Road, the first successful online anonymous marketplace, emerged, enabling buyers and sellers to transact with superior anonymity compared to traditional online or offline means. Primarily involved in narcotics trafficking, Silk Road's business rapidly boomed, leading to the emergence of competitors. Despite law enforcement efforts, which culminated in the shutdown of Silk Road in October 2013, the ecosystem of online anonymous marketplaces continued to evolve. This paper presents a long-term measurement analysis of 16 different marketplaces over more than two years (2013–2015). By combining our own data collection with publicly available previous efforts, we provide a detailed understanding of the growth and evolution of this ecosystem. We document the types of goods sold, the impact of adversarial events (such as law enforcement operations), vendor diversification, and the evolution of security practices (e.g., PGP adoption). Our findings shed light on how traditional physical-world criminal activities are developing an online presence, similar to the diversification of traditional commerce in the 1990s.

## 1. Introduction

In February 2011, a new Tor hidden service, "Silk Road," was launched, positioning itself as an online anonymous marketplace where buyers and sellers could conduct transactions with enhanced anonymity. This was achieved through the use of Tor hidden services and the Bitcoin payment system, providing stronger anonymity guarantees than any other online marketplace. Silk Road did not sell products directly but provided feedback systems, escrow services, and optional hedging services.

The anonymity provided by Silk Road emboldened users to trade primarily in contraband and narcotics. While not the first, Silk Road was the most successful due to its perceived superior anonymity. The business model proved viable, leading to the emergence of competitors such as Black Market Reloaded, Atlantis, and Sheep Marketplace.

In October 2013, Silk Road was shut down, and its operator was arrested. However, this event did not cause the demise of the ecosystem. Instead, it led to the rapid emergence of new marketplaces, including Silk Road 2.0, set up by former administrators and vendors. These marketplaces offered various levels of sophistication, durability, and specialization, and the ecosystem evolved significantly from the days when Silk Road was nearly a monopoly.

In this paper, we present measurements and analysis of the anonymous marketplace ecosystem over a period of two and a half years between 2013 and 2015. Previous studies have focused on specific marketplaces or high-level characteristics. By using long-term measurements and combining our data with previous efforts, we offer a detailed understanding of the ecosystem's evolution. We measure the impact of the Silk Road takedown, the effect of reported scams, vendor diversification, and the evolution of security practices. Our findings provide insights into how traditional criminal activities are developing an online presence, similar to the diversification of traditional commerce in the 1990s.

## 2. Online Anonymous Marketplaces

The sale of contraband and illicit products on the Internet can be traced back to the early days of the Internet, with forums and bulletin board systems. However, over the past six years, online markets have become more sophisticated and scaled, evolving from confidential listings to large online anonymous marketplaces. Following the Silk Road blueprint, these marketplaces run as Tor hidden services, providing superior communication anonymity and using pseudonymous currencies like Bitcoin for transactions.

These marketplaces do not sell contraband themselves but act as risk management platforms for participants in illegal transactions. They mitigate risk by reducing the potential for physical violence, providing superior anonymity, and offering escrow services to prevent financial risk. Additionally, they provide a feedback system to enforce quality control, which is crucial for our measurements.

## 3. Measurement Methodology

Our methodology involves crawling and parsing online anonymous marketplaces. Table 1 lists the marketplaces for which we have data. We scraped 35 different marketplaces a total of 1,908 times, resulting in a dataset of 3.2 TB. The size of the data corpus and other challenges led us to develop a custom web scraping framework built on Scrapy and Tor.

### 3.1 Scraping Marketplaces

We designed the scraping framework with several goals in mind:
1. **Stealthy Scraping:** Avoid alerting marketplace administrators to our presence.
2. **Complete and Instantaneous Scrapes:** Ensure a coherent picture of the marketplace without unobserved actions.
3. **Reliability:** Handle marketplace unavailability and retry failed requests.
4. **Robustness:** Handle client-side state and avoid detection schemes.

To achieve these goals, we manually inspect each site, build a configuration with regular expressions for URLs, and use session cookies obtained by solving CAPTCHAs. We also obfuscate requests by randomly selecting Tor circuits to distribute requests and avoid triggering anti-DDoS heuristics.

## 4. Measurement Analysis

Our analysis reveals several interesting properties. The online anonymous marketplace ecosystem appears resilient to adverse events such as law enforcement takedowns or exit scams. The types of products sold remain stable over time, with cannabis, ecstasy, and cocaine-related products consistently accounting for about 70% of all sales. Vendor characteristics show a mix of specialized and diversified sellers, with a few highly successful vendors and many grossing less than $10,000. This suggests that online anonymous marketplaces primarily compete with street dealers rather than established criminal organizations.

## 5. Limitations and Open Questions

While our approach provides valuable insights, it has limitations. For example, the accuracy of our sales volume estimates depends on the completeness and reliability of the feedback data. Future work should address these limitations and explore additional aspects of the ecosystem.

## 6. Related Work

Previous studies have focused on specific marketplaces or high-level characteristics. Our work builds on these efforts by providing a long-term, comprehensive analysis of the ecosystem.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper presents a detailed analysis of the longitudinal evolution of the online anonymous marketplace ecosystem. Our findings highlight the resilience of the ecosystem, the stability of product types, and the evolving vendor landscape. These insights contribute to our understanding of how traditional criminal activities are adapting to the online environment.
