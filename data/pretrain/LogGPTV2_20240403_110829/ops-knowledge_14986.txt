User: How can I configure windows command dialog to run different python versions in it? For example when I type python2 it runs python 2.7 and when I type python3 it runs python 3.3? I know how to configure environment variables for one version but two? I mean something like Linux terminal.
Assistant: I also met the case to use both python2 and python3 on my Windows machine. Here's how i resolved it: 

download python2x and python3x, installed them. 
add C:\Python35;C:\Python35\Scripts;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts to environment variable PATH.
Go to C:\Python35 to rename python.exe to python3.exe, also to C:\Python27, rename python.exe to python2.exe.
restart your command window. 
type python2 scriptname.py, or python3 scriptname.py in command line to switch the version you like.
