I am not an advanced user of CSS so forgive me if this issue is due to my
misunderstanding.
I am using the latest (v2.0.3) bootstrap Hero example to show this issue. When
I create a single_long_word of text greater than about 1/2 the column size
(due to a large font or simply a large number of characters in a single word),
the text extends past the column before the layout adjusts as I make the
browser window smaller
All I had to do was change the text in the column to make a large or long word
and then reduce the window size of the browser. The column layouts do
eventually adjust to allow for more width, but not before the long word
exceeds the boundary of the column it is in.
This happens for both normal and fluid containers in with a responsive grid.
It is easy to duplicate in Chrome by just going to this page and editing the
text after inspecting a column element.

I have also posted the issue to

suggestions.
