**Subject: Retrieving Python Installation Path on Windows Command Line**

Hi,

I am looking for a way to get the installation path of Python from the command line in Windows, without setting an environment variable. 

Could you please provide some guidance on how to achieve this?

Thank you.

**Response:**

Hello,

You can retrieve the Python installation path by checking the Windows Registry. The relevant keys are located at:

- For system-wide installations:
  ```
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\<PYTHON_VERSION>\InstallPath
  ```

- For user-specific installations:
  ```
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\<PYTHON_VERSION>\InstallPath
  ```

Replace `<PYTHON_VERSION>` with the specific version of Python you have installed (e.g., `3.9`).

Alternatively, you can use the `where` command in the Command Prompt to find the Python executable, which will give you the path to the directory where Python is installed:

```sh
where python
```

This command will list all the locations where the `python` executable is found in the system's PATH.

I hope this helps!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
