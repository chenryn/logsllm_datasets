### What problem does this feature solve?
If you have a duplicate key in v-for or a key that isn't a primitive type, you
get a helpful warning in the console in development mode. But if you spell the
key name wrong `:key="object.typ"` instead of `:key="object.type"`, the `key`
becomes undefined and there's no warning or error, even though all keys are
undefined and therefore duplicates.
### What does the proposed API look like?
Same API but with browser console error like is shown for other v-for key
errors.
