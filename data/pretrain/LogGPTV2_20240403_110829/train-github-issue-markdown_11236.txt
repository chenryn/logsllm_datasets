### Problem description
Cannot use more than one MuiThemeProvider, using `1.0.0-alpha.22`. We use
multiple themes at once, but in this alpha version it seems to loose this
capability. When we change the theme inner into the tree, the MuiThemeProvider
in the upper tree breaks, the classnames are generated normally for the
components when using multiple themes, but when the inner MuiThemeProvider
changes, it shifts the stylesheets in the upper MuiThemeProvider in the head.
It might be related with React Router, having different MuiThemeProvider
inside the routes.
