We assess each of the four MTD perturbations in terms of (i)
attack detection and (ii) operational cost.
For attack detection, we inject an attack of the form a =
Htc into the modiﬁed power network (after the MTD), and
examine its BDD residual. For illustration, we consider two
attacks – attack 1 in which c = [0, 1, 1, 1]T and attack 2 in
which c = [0, 0, 0, 1]T – and set η = 0.2. For simplicity,
we ignore measurement noises. The BDD residuals under the
four MTD perturbations are listed in Table I. Note that in
the absence of measurement noise, a non-zero value of the
residual indicates the presence of attack. We observe that for
each of the four perturbations, there exist attack vectors of the
form a = Htc, which continue to bypass the BDD for the
perturbed power network.
We also enlist the post-pertubration OPF cost in Table III.
We observe that

four cases, compared to its pre-perturbation cost, and the
perturbation ∆x3 incurs the least cost.

C. MTD Perturbation Selection Challenges
Based on the above illustrating example, we make the
following conclusions. First, it is evident that a subset of
the attacks of the form a = Htc continue to bypass the
BDD after the MTD. Since the defender does not have prior
knowledge of the actual attack vector (note that c is chosen
by the attacker), he cannot make an informed choice of
which perturbation to adopt. Without such knowledge, the
defender must select the MTD that is capable of detecting
a largest subset of the possible attacks. The second design
criterion is the MTD’s operational cost, i.e., other things being
equal, the defender prefers a least-cost MTD. In the following
G1Bus 4Bus 1170 G2Bus 2Bus 3200 150  50sections, we characterize formally the MTD’s effectiveness
and its operational cost, and present a framework for choosing
appropriate MTD perturbations that balance between the two
concerns.
V. MTD’S EFFECTIVENESS OF ATTACK DETECTION
In this section, we address the problem of selecting effective
MTD reactance perturbations from an attack detection point
of view. The goal is to select reactance perturbations within
the physical constraints of the D-FACTS devices to effectively
invalidate the attacker’s knowledge for bypassing the BDD.
The section is divided into two parts. In the ﬁrst part, we
devise a metric to quantify the effectiveness of the MTD. In
the second part, we derive the conditions and propose design
criteria for MTD perturbations to preclude stealthy FDI attacks
in practice.
Henceforth, we use the notation “MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)” to refer to a
reactance perturbation that changes the measurement matrix
t(cid:48). We let A denote the set of all attack vectors
from Ht to H(cid:48)
of the form a = Htc, i.e.,
A = {a : a = Htc,||a|| ≤ amax, c ∈ RN}.
t(cid:48), where P (cid:48)
For an attack vector a, we let P (cid:48)
D(a) denote its detection
D(a) = P(r(cid:48) ≥ τ ).
probability under MTD H(cid:48)
We denote by A(cid:48)(δ) ⊆ A the subset of attacks in A whose
detection probability under MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) is greater than a given
δ ∈ [0, 1], i.e.,
A(cid:48)(δ) = {a : a = Htc,||a|| ≤ amax, P (cid:48)
A. Metric to Quantify MTD’s Effectiveness
D(a) > δ, c ∈ RN}.
First, we devise a metric to quantify the MTD’s effective-
ness. Intuitively, an MTD perturbation “A” is more effective
than a perturbation “B” if it can detect more FDI attacks in
the set A with high probability. However, A, a subset in the
n-dimensional space (Rn), has inﬁnitely many attack vectors.
For these sets, the Lebesgue measure generalizes the notion of
length (one-dimensional), area (two-dimensional), or volume
(three-dimensional) to n-dimensions [28]. The effectiveness of
t(cid:48) for a given δ ∈ [0, 1], which we denote by η(cid:48)(δ),
an MTD H(cid:48)
can be quantiﬁed as
η(cid:48)(δ) =
λ(A(cid:48)(δ))
λ(A)
,
(2)
where λ(A(cid:48)(δ)) and λ(A) denote the Lebesgue measures of
the respective sets. Intuitively, η(cid:48)(δ) represents the ratio of
the number of attack vectors of the form a = Htc whose
detection probability under MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) is greater than δ to the
total number of attacks in the set A. Since A(cid:48)(δ) ⊆ A, 0 ≤
η(cid:48)(δ) ≤ 1.
Of particular interest are the sets A(cid:48)(α) and A\A(cid:48)(α), and
the latter is the set of undetectable attacks under MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)
(refer to Section III for the deﬁnition of undetectable attacks).
An ideal MTD is one that admits no undetectable attacks of
the form a = Htc, i.e., A(cid:48)(α) = A and η(cid:48)(α) = 1. In the
following subsection, we derive conditions on the MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)
that can ensure the property.
B. MTD Admitting No Undetectable Attacks
We start by characterizing the condition for an attack a =
Htc to remain undetectable under MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48).
Proposition 1. An attack of the form a = Htc is undetectable
under MTD perturbation H(cid:48)
it satisﬁes the condition
t(cid:48)
rank(H(cid:48)
is the
augmented matrix.
t(cid:48) Htc]), where [H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) = rank([H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) Htc]
if
t(cid:48), since rank(H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) Htc]) for the attack vector a = Htc ∈ Col(H(cid:48)
The proof of this proposition is presented in Appendix A.
Intuitively, the proposition implies that an attack vector of the
form a = Htc is undetectable under MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) if it lies in
the column spaces of both Ht and H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) =
rank([H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)).
The result allows us to give conditions for the MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)
to ensure no undetectable attacks of the form a = Htc. In
particular, to achieve the aforementioned property, MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)
must be selected such that no attack vector a in the column
space of Ht lies in the column space of H(cid:48)
t(cid:48). The following
theorem states the condition.
Theorem 1. An MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) has no undetectable attacks of the
form a = Htc if Col(H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) is the orthogonal complement of
Col(Ht). Furthermore, for a given attack vector a, such an
MTD achieves the maximum value of P (cid:48)
D(a) among all the
possible MTD perturbations.
The proof is presented in Appendix B. The ﬁrst statement
of this theorem implies that for the MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) satisfying the
orthogonality condition, there are no attacks of the form a =
Htc for which P (cid:48)
D(a) is as low as the FP rate α (in general,
α is chosen by the SO to be a small value). However, this
result does not automatically imply that the attacks will also be
detected with high probability, which is the desired outcome.
But the second statement of Theorem 1 shows that this is
indeed the case, since such an MTD also maximizes P (cid:48)
D(a)
among all possible MTD perturbations.
From Theorem 1, we conclude that purely from an attack
detection point of view, an MTD perturbation should be se-
lected to achieve the stated orthogonality condition. However,
this may not always be feasible due to practical limitations,
e.g., the D-FACTS devices may only allow the reactances to
be perturbed within a certain range. In these cases, we require
an additional design criterion to select the MTD perturbations,
which is the subject of the following subsection.
C. Heuristic Design Criteria for Selecting MTD Perturbation
to meet
Intuitively,
if the reactance adjustment capability of D-
FACTS is insufﬁcient
the orthogonality condition
of Theorem 1, the MTD perturbation should be selected to
make Col(H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) as orthogonal to Col(Ht) as possible within
the constraints of the D-FACTS device. To formalize this
notion, we introduce the concept of principal angle between
subspaces, deﬁned as follows:
Fig. 4: Orientation of Col(H(cid:48)
γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) ≤ π/2, and (c) γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) with respect to Col(Ht), (a) γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) = π/2 (orthogonal column spaces).
t(cid:48)) = 0 (perfectly aligned column spaces), (b) 0 ≤
Deﬁnition V.1 ([29]). The smallest principal angle (SPA) 0 ≤
θ ≤ π/2 between the subspaces F,G ⊆ CN is deﬁned as
cos(θ) =
max
u∈F ,u∈G
||u||=1,||v||=1
|uH v|.
The SPA generalizes the concept of angle between a pair of
vectors to a pair of n-dimensional subspaces. Let γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48))
denote the SPA between Col(Ht) and Col(H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)). We conjec-
ture that MTD perturbations with a higher value of γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48))
are more effective in terms of attack detection. Thus, SPA
can be utilized as a design criterion for selecting good MTD
perturbations.
t(cid:48)).
The conjecture is based upon the following observations. (i)
In Appendix C, we present arguments which suggest that the
attack detection probability P (cid:48)
D(a) increases as we select MTD
perturbations with higher γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)). (ii) In the following, we
give some observations to suggest that the measure of the set of
undetectable attacks decreases by selecting MTD perturbations
with higher γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
We examine MTD perturbations in two extreme cases as
illustrated in Fig. 4. First, consider MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) = (1 + η)Ht,
for which it can be veriﬁed that γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) = 0. For such an
MTD, the column spaces of the matrices Ht and H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) are per-
fectly aligned. Hence all attacks of the form a = Htc remain
undetectable after the MTD (i.e., A(cid:48)(α) = ∅ and λ(A(cid:48)(α)) =
0). Thus, an MTD perturbation with γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) = 0 is the
least effective in detecting FDI attacks. Second, for MTD
H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) satisfying the orthogonality condition of Theorem 1, it
can be veriﬁed that γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) = π/2. As shown in the
previous subsection, in this case, A(cid:48)(α) = A and there are
no undetectable attacks of the form a = Hc.
These arguments suggest that MTD perturbations for which
γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) is closer to π/2 are more effective in detecting FDI
attacks, a trend that is also conﬁrmed by our simulation results
using the IEEE 14-bus system (see Section VII). A natural
follow up question is how to select the reactance perturbation
vector ∆xt,t(cid:48) to achieve the aforementioned design criteria.
In the next section, we present an optimization framework to
numerically compute ∆xt,t(cid:48) while also considering the MTD’s
operational cost.
VI. MTD’S COST-BENEFIT TRADEOFF
Thus far, we have investigated the MTD from an attack
detection point of view only. In this section, we formally deﬁne
the operational cost of MTD in an optimization framework.
MTD Operational Cost
We quantify MTD’s cost in terms of the increase in OPF
cost due to the MTD relative to its value without MTD, i.e.,
CMTD,t(cid:48) =
