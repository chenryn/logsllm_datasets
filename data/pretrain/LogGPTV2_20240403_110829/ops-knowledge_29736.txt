User: Please introduce a distributed system deployment solution, how to solve the communication problem between nodes?
Assistant: A deployment solution of a distributed system may be deployed using container technology. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Write the system code. Write the code required by the system as a service. 2. Package the service into a container image. This allows services to run on different nodes. 3. Deploy containers to each node. Deploying containers on different servers enables multiple nodes to work together to provide services and process requests. 4. Perform service discovery and load balancing. Use the service registry to implement service discovery and load balancing. 5. Solve the communication problem between nodes. Communication can be done using REST API or gRPC based on HTTP or TCP protocol. At the same time, distributed consensus protocols such as Zookeeper or ETCD can also be used to achieve synchronization between nodes. In short, by using containers to deploy distributed systems, the scalability, reliability, and elasticity of the system can be improved, and more technical means need to be combined to solve the communication problem between nodes.
