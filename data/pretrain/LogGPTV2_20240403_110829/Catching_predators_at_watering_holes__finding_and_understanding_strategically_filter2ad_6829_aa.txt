ABSTRACT
Unlike a random, run-of-the-mill website infection, in a strategic
web attack, the adversary carefully chooses the target frequently
visited by an organization or a group of individuals to compro-
mise, for the purpose of gaining a step closer to the organization
or collecting information from the group. This type of attacks,
called “watering hole”, have been increasingly utilized by APT ac-
tors to get into the internal networks of big companies and gov-
ernment agencies or monitor politically oriented groups. With its
importance, little has been done so far to understand how the attack
works, not to mention any concrete step to counter this threat.
In this paper, we report our ﬁrst step toward better understand-
ing this emerging threat, through systematically discovering and
analyzing new watering hole instances and attack campaigns. This
was made possible by a carefully designed methodology, which re-
peatedly monitors a large number potential watering hole targets to
detect unusual changes that could be indicative of strategic com-
promises. Running this system on the HTTP trafﬁc generated from
visits to 61K websites for over 5 years, we are able to discover and
conﬁrm 17 watering holes and 6 campaigns never reported before.
Given so far there are merely 29 watering holes reported by blogs
and technical reports, the ﬁndings we made contribute to the re-
search on this attack vector, by adding 59% more attack instances
and information about how they work to the public knowledge.
Analyzing the new watering holes allows us to gain deeper un-
derstanding of these attacks, such as repeated compromises of po-
litical websites, their long lifetimes, unique evasion strategy (lever-
aging other compromised sites to serve attack payloads) and new
exploit techniques (no malware delivery, web only information gath-
ering). Also, our study brings to light interesting new observations,
including the discovery of a recent JSONP attack on an NGO web-
site that has been widely reported and apparently forced the attack
to stop.

as you always did in countless prior visits. This time, however, the
menu stealthily drops a piece of malware on your ofﬁce computer,
which later silently collects your personal and business information
and further propagates across your company’s internal network. It
turns out that the malware was actually strategically planted there
for the purpose of inﬁltrating your company, due to the popularity
of the restaurant among the company’s employees. This is an exam-
ple of targeted inﬁltrations, which aim at one speciﬁc organization,
population group or industry of high value. They are the ﬁrst step
of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
[34, 45], a continuous,
multi-stage and stealthy hacking process for such serious purposes
as international espionage, sabotage, intellectual property theft and
domestic surveillance, etc. In the past few years, APT attacks have
led to the breach of critical national infrastructures [29] and the
computing systems of leading companies [48], news agencies [53]
and political dissidents [55]. According to various published re-
ports (e.g., [34, 45]), such an attack involves several phases, among
which the most important are the steps (reconnaissance and deliv-
ery) that get adversaries a foothold into the target system. This
is often achieved through social engineering, such as spear phish-
ing [39, 42] and increasingly strategic website compromising1 ,
dubbed “watering hole attacks” [29], as described in the above ex-
ample.
Strategic site targeting. Simply put, in a watering hole attack, the
adversary carefully selects a set of websites frequently visited by
his targets and by compromising these sites gains opportunities to
penetrate the targets’ systems, in a way much like the predator lurk-
ing around a watering hole to wait for its prey to show up. Since the
selected websites are typically trusted by the target, such an attack
is often very effective, as pointed out by a Symantec report: “Any
manufacturers who are in the defense supply chain need to be wary
of attacks emanating from subsidiaries, business partners, and as-
sociated companies, as they may have been compromised and used
as a stepping-stone to the truly intended target” [54]. Examples in-
clude the compromise of the Council on Foreign Relation website
for attacking other agencies [37], the infection on forbes.com that
targets the defense industry [53] and the use of a restaurant menu
to get into an oil company’s network [59].
Defense against watering hole attacks is challenging. These at-
tacks often involve zero-day exploits, malware or other unique tech-
niques, which are hard to detect. Limiting access to all such fre-
quently visited sites is not a viable solution, given the inconve-
nience it would bring in. Without scalable techniques, monitor-
1Throughout this paper, we use the two terms “Strategic compromise” and “watering
hole” interchangeably.
ing these sites for malicious activities is difﬁcult, due to their large
number (e.g., 120K sites we found to be visited for at least 10 times
within 8 months from a company’s trafﬁc traces). Most impor-
tantly, given the fact that such targeted attacks only aim at a small
set of carefully selected targets, and therefore are much less fre-
quent [46, 39, 42] and stealthier than random compromises, so far
only 29 watering hole instances have been reported and made pub-
lic. In the absence of adequate real-world attack data, our under-
standing of this emerging threat is very limited, making it hard to
come up with any effective response.
Finding watering holes. In this paper, we report the ﬁrst system-
atic study on watering holes, making an important step toward bet-
ter understanding such elusive but signiﬁcant threat, through dis-
covery of new strategic compromises and in-depth analysis of these
cases. This was achieved using a new methodology which helped
ﬁnd new watering holes by continuously analyzing the network
trafﬁc triggered during the visit to a set of likely target websites.
At the center of the methodology is Eyeson, a system that performs
a lightweight persistent surveillance of the likely targets by inspect-
ing only the headers of the HTTP requests to the site. From such
thin information, Eyeson automatically builds a model for the rate
of the change (based upon quantiﬁed features such as hostnames,
content types, URL patterns, ﬁle names, etc.) observed across dif-
ferent visits to the same site. Once a sudden big change occurs (dis-
covered from HTTP headers), which are supposed to be unlikely to
happen according to the model, the site is ﬂagged and goes through
other analyses to determine if it is indeed compromised.
The simplicity and efﬁciency of the methodology enable contin-
uous monitoring and analysis of a large number of potential tar-
gets of watering hole attacks. In our research, we ran Eyeson on
61K websites (selected from a company’s internal trafﬁc logs), and
178 other likely targets. For each targeted website, we collected its
HTTP trafﬁc, leveraging archive.org, from 2010 to 2015 to analyze
their change rates. Addionally, we performed continuous real time
crawling of a smaller list of targets. As a result of the study, 30
possible strategic compromises were sent to our industry partner
for validation and in 3 months, 17 sites among them and 6 cam-
paigns never reported before have so far been conﬁrmed. Note
that conﬁrming watering holes is extremely complicated and time-
consuming, requiring resources, experience and cyber intelligence
to infer the adversary’s intentions. As an example for the complex-
ity of this task, iphonedevsdk.com is reported to be compromised
twice: one is strategic and the other is not (Section 3.3). Given
the difﬁculty in ﬁnding and validating this new type of targeted at-
tacks, so far only 29 watering hole cases were made public (through
blogs [48, 53, 22, 55], technical reports [30, 29], etc.). Our study
brings to light over 59% more attack instances and 6 new cam-
paigns, a signiﬁcant contribution to the effort of understanding and
mitigating this emerging threat.
Our discoveries.
Indeed, our study has already led to new in-
sights into how such elusive attacks work. As a prominent example,
we found that RSF-chinese.org, a Chinese NGO, was strategically
compromised and implanted with malicious JavaScript code that
exploits the JSONP vulnerabilities within leading Chinese websites
like baidu.com to collect identity information from the visitor, such
as her email address, name, etc.The attack technique here has never
been reported before and is important in a sense that it can defeat
the protection of popular privacy enhancing technologies like TOR
provides to the visitors of politically sensitive sites. This ﬁnding
has been conﬁrmed by an AV vendor and received intensive me-
dia coverage [23, 58, 51, 64]. Also found in our study are other
high proﬁle political sites such as boxun.com, which was compro-
mised multiple times, the Carter Center, cartercenter.com and other
politically oriented watering hole campaigns. For the attacks on
enterprises, we observed new instances and interesting strategies.
For example, an India shipyard’s website was found to be strategi-
cally compromised and a new watering hole running the ScanBox
framework [22] was found to exhibit targeting behavior never re-
ported before, e.g., delivering malicious payload to website visitors
from a computing center in San Diego but not from a university.
These new ﬁndings help us better understand such strategic com-
promises. Particularly, our study presents strong evidence that the
watering hole perpetrators not only aim at a speciﬁc organization
but also at a group of politically oriented people. Further, the
repeated compromises of political sites demonstrate that they are
relatively soft targets compared with the corporate websites that
are better protected and rarely exploited multiple times. Also, we
found that watering holes are characterized by a long lifetime, in
some cases, a few years, and unique evasion tricks, which hide their
attack payloads, redirection scripts etc. on legitimate (but compro-
mised) or legitimate looking third party domains, or even utilize
these domains as command and control (C&C) centers. In terms
of attack techniques, it is surprising to see that the adversary may
not deliver any malware or compromise the victim’s system at all:
sometimes, all they do is just collect information through the vic-
tim’s browser (e.g., the JSONP watering hole).
Contributions. The contributions of the paper are outlined below:
•New understanding of the watering hole attacks. We conducted
the ﬁrst systematic study on strategic compromises leading to the
discovery of high impact watering hole attacks never reported be-
fore. Compared with the state of the art, these ﬁndings enable us
to gain a better understanding about the motivations, targets and
strategies of the APT actors. Now we know how politically ori-
ented sites are targeted and exploited and how unique strategies
were deployed to collect information and spread infections. This is
critical for developing effective responses and will inspire follow
up work on the emerging threat.
•New methodology. Such a new understanding was gained through
analyzing a set of new attack instances and campaigns our research
contributes to the APT research community. These instances were
discovered by a lightweight methodology that only inspects the
headers of HTTP requests, which is therefore capable of continu-
ously monitoring a large number of potential targets to track down
the changes occurring there. Although Eyeson, at its current state,
was only used to ﬁnd us more watering hole instances, the system
has the potential to be deployed in a corporate environment as a
pre-ﬁltering mechanism, after proper improvement and evaluation.
2. BACKGROUND
Here, we present overview about the strategic attacks on web-
sites, and outline the adversarial model used in our research.
Strategically compromised websites. For an APT actor attempt-
ing to inﬁltrate an organizational network, one effective approach is
to compromise the site frequently visited by the employees and use
it as an infection vector to disseminate malware. The details of this
type of website compromise were ﬁrst revealed by RSA FirstWatch
in 2012, which reported a “VOHO” campaign aiming at business
and government agencies in certain geographic areas [29]. In the
campaign, the adversary infected carefully selected sites (e.g., Mas-
sachusetts Bank [10]) and planted a malicious JavaScript there. The
compromised site checked whether a visiting system was running
Windows and a speciﬁc version of Internet Explorer, and if so, redi-
rected the browser to torontocurling.com, also a compromised site,
using an iframe to exploit the browser and install a remote access
Trojan (RAT) called Gh0st [57]. This attack ﬁrst used a zero-day
vulnerability in Microsoft XML Core Services, and then switched
to a known Java vulnerability.
More recently, a few more watering hole cases are reported [53,
38, 30, 31]. A prominent example is the attack on Forbes.com,
in which malware infection was hiding inside the “Thought of the
Day” Flash widget that automatically shows up once the website
is visited. Those running vulnerable browsers were then automati-
cally infected. The true targets of the attack appeared to be senior
executives and professionals in major corporations, as indicated by
Invincea [53], which further indicated that its customers in the de-
fense industrial base were particularly targeted by the malware.
In all these attacks, the adversary apparently gathered informa-
tion to identify the frequently visited websites trusted by the target
organization, and also carefully selected those less protected, in-
volving different types of vulnerabilities. Due to the stealthiness of
these attacks and their targeting nature, only a very small set of wa-
tering hole cases were made public: only 29 so far. In addition, the
technical details of the attacks were often not fully revealed. To un-
derstand and mitigate this threat, it is necessary to ﬁnd more attack
instances and collect more information regarding attack techniques.
Adversarial model. We consider an adversary trying to exploit
trusted popular external sites to inﬁltrate a target. The adversary
we studied in this case was able to acquire high proﬁle information
about the target, might leverage advanced techniques (e.g., zero-
day vulnerabilities) and invest a lot of effort in orchestrating the
attack. They can perform a number of actions such as arbitrarily
changing the content of the website, redirecting trafﬁc to other sites
under their control, monitoring visitors to the website etc. How-
ever, they can not completely hide the traces of their campaigns, as
the malicious payload has to be embedded in the web page of com-
promised sites, which could be observed by the network monitors
deployed by the organization, web crawlers operated by security
companies or security experts inevitably.
3. METHODOLOGY
A watering hole attack aims at the external websites frequently
visited by the victim or her organization, exploiting their long es-
tablished relation to ﬁnd an easy avenue for inﬁltrating the target.
On the other hand, such a relation can also be leveraged to im-
prove the chance to ﬁnd strategic compromises: after all, looking
back at the long history of interacting with a familiar site, an in-
dividual or an organization has a pretty good idea about how it is
supposed to behave, and how it evolves over time, even though the
amount of observable information for each visit is limited. The
key idea of Eyeson is to continuously monitor these strategic sites
