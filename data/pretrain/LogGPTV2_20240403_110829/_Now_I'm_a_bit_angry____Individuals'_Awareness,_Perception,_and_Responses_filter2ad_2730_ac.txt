asked participants how long they had been using the email
account, how frequently they checked it, and what they pri-
marily used it for. The majority of email accounts were used
for an extended period (mean: 8.75 years, median: 8). Most
(81%) were checked daily; the rest were checked less fre-
quently (14% weekly, 4% monthly, and 1% yearly). Partic-
ipants reported multiple uses for their email address (mean:
2.74, median: 3): 74% were used for personal correspondence,
followed by signing up for medium-sensitive accounts like
social media (68%), signing up for sensitive accounts like
banking (51%), signing up for low-value accounts (49%), and
professional correspondence (32%).
Overview of breaches. We observed 189 unique breaches
across 431 email addresses queried against HIBP. 302 (70%)
email addresses, or 73% of participants, were exposed in one
or more breaches. The average number of breaches per email
address was 5.12 (median: 3, sd: 6.21, max: 46), or 5.36 per
participant (median: 3, sd: 6.23). The number of breaches per
email address formed a long-tail distribution: 34% of email
addresses appeared in 1 to 5 breaches, and only 2% were

associated with 21 or more breaches.
For the 189 unique breaches, we examined their date, the
total amount of breached accounts, and the types of com-
promised data according to HIBP. The majority (69%) of
breaches occurred in 2015–2019; 15 breaches occurred in
2020. The average number of breached accounts captured
by HIBP was 46.52M (median: 4.79M; sd: 125M), indicat-
ing a distribution skewed by several large breaches (max:
772.90M). 66 different data types were leaked in our sam-
ple’s breaches. The average number of leaked data types per
breach was 4.86, and the maximum was 20 (median: 4, sd:
2.58). Aside from participants’ email addresses (which were
present in all breaches as HIBP uses them as references),
the other commonly breached data types included passwords
(162, 86%), usernames (110, 58%), IP addresses (82, 43%),
names (74, 39%), and dates of birth (47, 25%). The frequency
distribution of data types in our sample’s breaches falls off
steeply (see Figure 2), suggesting a broad range of leaked
data types with a much smaller set of commonly leaked data.
We used Cisco’s website content taxonomy3 for cross-
referencing breached organizations’ industry, excluding 25
(13%) non-applicable cases.4 Gaming companies were rep-
resented the most in our sample (40, 21%). Other repre-
sented industries included general business (17, 9%), comput-
ers/Internet (16, 8%), shopping (10, 5%), and online commu-
nities (10, 5%). We used Alexa’s ranking of global websites5
as of October 14, 2020 as a proxy for a breached organiza-
tion’s popularity.6 Excluding 33 organizations with missing
data, the average ranking was 650.73K (median: 24.85K, sd:
1,768K). 19 organizations appeared in the top 1K list, indi-
cating that while the majority of organizations in our sample
were not mainstream, a few were relatively well-known.

5.1 RQ1: Likelihood of Breaches
We conducted a logistic regression on whether an email ad-
dress had been breached in relation to the email account’s
age, checking frequency, and purpose of use. Results in Ta-
ble 2 show that an email address was signiﬁcantly more
likely to be breached as the account’s age in years increased

1.35x more likely to be part of a breach or gains 1.08x more
breaches than the previous year. Conversely, the signiﬁcant
intercept in both models suggests that a new and rarely used
email address is less likely to be involved in a breach. While
these results are somewhat intuitive, they indicate the perva-
siveness of data breaches: most email addresses queried in
our study had appeared in one or more breaches even though
they were only used in ordinary ways.
5.2 RQ2: Perceived Causes and Impacts of Be-
ing Affected by Breaches
We asked participants to speculate why or why not their email
address was part of a data breach and name any experienced
impacts or anticipated future impacts from a speciﬁc breach.
Perceived reasons for being affected by breaches. We an-
alyzed 302 open-ended responses to Question 10 in which
participants speculated why their email address was exposed
in one or more data breaches. The most common explanation,
cited in 159 (53%) cases, was that it was due to participants’
own email-related practices. Speciﬁcally, 70 (23%) mentioned
using the email address to sign up for many different sites
(e.g., “it’s on the website of every business I have an online
relationship with”). Another 31 (10%) mentioned the email’s
age as a relevant factor, saying it had been used for a long time.
23 (8%) expressed that breaches were inevitable, especially
for an old or widely-used email address (e.g., “there are a lot
of companies or organizations that have my email [address]
and chances are one of them is going to get hacked”). Fur-
thermore, in 31 (10%) cases, participants mentioned using
the email to sign up for seemingly sketchy websites, some-
times with a clear intention to do so despite knowing that the
website might be insecure.
Participants mentioned other insecure behaviors as poten-
tial reasons for being affected by a breach in 31 (10%) cases.
13 cases referred to password-related behaviors, such as using
simple passwords, reusing a password across accounts, or not
changing passwords frequently. Incautious clicking behavior
was mentioned ﬁve times (e.g., “because I was not careful
with what emails I clicked”). Other participants indicated their
exposure to breaches was due to infrequent monitoring of the
email account, easily guessed answers for security questions,
or being signed into the email account for too long. While
these are indeed insecure behaviors, password choices do not
impact one’s likelihood of being involved in a breach; they
impact a breach’s consequences by increasing the possibil-
ity of account hijacking due to credential stufﬁng. Similarly,
clicking on untrustworthy links may make the email address
appear in spam lists, which will be reported by HIBP if found
on the public web. However, this action on its own does not

Experienced and anticipated impacts of data breaches.
Participants with at least one breach were asked to describe a
given breach’s experienced or potential impacts (Question 16).
Of the 792 responses, more than half assessed the breach’s
impact as none (343, 43%) or very little (85, 11%); another 77
(10%) were unsure. Only 19 (4%) breaches were perceived
as having a large impact. In 135 (17%) cases, participants de-
scribed emotional feelings without naming concrete impacts,
such as “no impact just rage.”
In 149 (19%) instances, participants described speciﬁc ex-
perienced impacts or anticipated future impacts. The most
