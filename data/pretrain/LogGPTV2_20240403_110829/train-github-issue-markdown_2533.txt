### Problem Description
This feature aims to address the challenge of converting certain Bootstrap 4 components (or components from other CSS frameworks) into a more flexible and compatible format. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to nest components such as `progress-group` and `progress`. 

In Bootstrap 4, nested `div` elements within a component can disrupt the intended structure, as the framework is not designed to handle nested parent elements. For example, if you try to create a `progress-group` that contains multiple `progress` components, the existing parent element for each component can interfere with the overall layout. This problem extends to other components as well, such as:

```html
<div class="price">$</div>
<div class="amount">00</div>
```

In this case, the `div` elements cannot be nested without breaking the Bootstrap 4 structure.

To resolve this, I am requesting the implementation of a **containerless** feature. This feature would allow components to be created without a parent element wrapper, making it easier to convert CSS frameworks into a complete Vue toolbox.

### Proposed API
I propose adding a configuration option to enable the containerless feature. A possible implementation could look like this:

```javascript
{
  containerless: true
}
```

This configuration would allow developers to specify that a component should be rendered without an additional parent element, thus preserving the desired structure and ensuring compatibility with Bootstrap 4 and other CSS frameworks.
