### What problem does this feature solve?
This is a problem to convert some Bootstrap 4 components (or other CSS
frameworks) for example:
We can not create two components `progress-group` and `progress` because
inside dives can not accept another div (`parent element`). Bootstrap 4 does
not work in this way.
Existing `parent element` for each component destroys the Bootstrap 4
structure I can show you another examples:
        $
        .00
and a lot more.
So I want to ask for **containerless (a component without`parent element` as a
wrapper) feature** for component design system. It can help us to convert a
CSS framework to complete Vue toolbox.
### What does the proposed API look like?
I am not sure the right way may be a config as `{ containerless : true }`
