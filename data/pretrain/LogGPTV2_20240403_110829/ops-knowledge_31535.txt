User: How to build a web server using AWS EC2 instance?
Assistant: The following are the steps to build a web server on AWS EC2: 1. Create an EC2 instance Log in to the AWS console, enter the EC2 service, and click the "Launch Instance" button to create a new instance. Select an appropriate AMI (Amazon Machine Image). It is recommended to choose an AMI based on Amazon Linux 2. Select the instance type (t2.micro is recommended, it is free), and set options such as VPC and subnet. 2. After connecting to the EC2 instance and successfully creating the instance, you can see the public IP address of the instance in the console. Using an SSH client such as PuTTY, connect to the EC2 instance using this IP address. 3. Install the web server After connecting to the EC2 instance, use the following commands to update the packages and install the Apache server: - sudo yum update - sudo yum install httpd Start the Apache server: - sudo service httpd start Access the public IP address, you can see The default Apache welcome page is now available. 4. Configure the firewall to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic, the corresponding ports need to be opened in the AWS console. Go to Security Group settings, edit inbound rules, add HTTP and HTTPS rules. 5. Deploy the web application Copy the web application to the /var/www/html/ directory on the EC2 instance, then start the Apache server. Now, the website can be accessed using the public IP address. It is important to note that it is usually necessary to use a domain name rather than an IP address to access a website. You can resolve the domain name to the public IP address of the EC2 instance, or set up the Amazon Route 53 service to manage the domain name and DNS resolution.
