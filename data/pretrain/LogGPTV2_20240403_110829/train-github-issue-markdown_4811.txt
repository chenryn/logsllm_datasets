**Current behavior**
I am creating an editable table with add and remove row feature in the
FormGroup with validation.  
The table works when the rows add or remove from last. When the row is removed
from the middle of the table, angular throw an error "There is no FormControl
instance attached to form control element with name name_2".  
On adding the row I have used the "addControl" method to add control in the
group and on the removal of the row I am using "removeControl" method.  
**Expected behavior**
There should be no error, from whichever place I remove or add the row.  
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
