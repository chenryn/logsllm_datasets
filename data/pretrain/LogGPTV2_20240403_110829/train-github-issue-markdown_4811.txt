**Current Behavior:**
I am developing an editable table with add and remove row functionality within a `FormGroup` that includes validation. The table functions correctly when rows are added or removed from the end. However, if a row is removed from the middle of the table, Angular throws an error: "There is no FormControl instance attached to form control element with name 'name_2'." I am using the `addControl` method to add controls to the group and the `removeControl` method to remove them.

**Expected Behavior:**
The table should function without errors, regardless of where rows are added or removed.

**Minimal Reproduction:**
Please provide a minimal reproduction of the problem with clear instructions.
