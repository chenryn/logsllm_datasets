User: This seems to be a dumb question, but how do I ssh into the kivy-remote-shell?
I'm trying to use buildozer and seem to be able to get the application built and deployed with the command, buildozer -v android debug deploy run, which ends with the application being pushed, and displayed on my android phone, connected via USB.
However, when I try ssh -p8000 admin@127.0.0.1 from a terminal on the ubuntu machine I pushed the app from I get Connection Refused.
It seems to me that there should be a process on the host (ubuntu) machine in order to proxy the connection, or maybe I just don't see how this works?
Am I missing something simple, or do I need to dig in a debug a bit more?
Assistant: Don't know you found the answer or not. But what i have understood is that you are trying to connect android device from Ubuntu. If I am right then (go on reading) you are following wrong steps.
First :- Your Ubuntu does not have ssh server by default so you get this error message.
Second :- You are using 127.0.0.1 address i.e your Ubuntu machine itself.
Method to do this shall be
Give your android machine a static address or if it gets dynamic its OK.
know the IP address of android and then from Ubuntu typessh -p8000 admin@IP_Of_andrid_device and this should solve the issue.
