Because the reserved and available ASes are not registered, we were not
able to ﬁnd registration information for them. Instead, we looked at the BGP

topology of these preﬁxes, and investigated on the evolution of the blackspace
preﬁx through time. For 33 % of the cases where a blackspace preﬁx is origi-
nated from a reserved AS, the origin AS remains reserved throughout the
whole observation period. The preﬁxes were marked as reserved. These net-
works are usually single-homed and peer either directly with a tier-1 provider,
or with a tier-3. The other 66 % preﬁxes show a state transition from, or to,
reserved. In all the cases we observed, this was due to a network owner either
bringing up a new network, or decommissioning an old one. For example, half a
dozen blackspace preﬁxes were originated from a reserved AS for six months
through a tier-1 AS. On one day, the AS status changed to assigned and the
name matched a well-known airline. The next day, the preﬁxes were all given
inetnum entries in the IRR. Our interpretation is that the preﬁxes and ASN
were reserved for the growth of said airline, and that they started using these
resources before the paperwork had been fully processed. In another case, the
preﬁxes and ASN were allocated, but one day turned to reserved. By look-
ing up the company’s name, we were able to ﬁnd a letter from ICANN, informing
the company that they had breached their registrar accreditation agreement by
failing to meet technical requirements, and also by failing to pay the accredita-
tion fees. The day following the date of the letter, all of that company’s resource
where changed to reserved. In some cases, there are transitions from allo-
cated, to reserved, and then back to allocated. In this situation, we believe
the situation was similar to the one of the last example, except that they cor-
rected their behaviour to meet the requirements during the grace period. In the
case of available ASes, there were only a handful of situations in which the AS
(and the announced blackspace preﬁx) ended up as allocated or assigned.
In these situations, it was the result of a new network being connected to the
global Internet.
In conclusion, by looking at the routing-level characteristics, we were able
to identify a set of blackspace preﬁxes that appear to be benign. Some pre-
ﬁxes appear to be in the blackspace because they have just been allocated, or
because they are being phased out. Moreover, some blackspace networks are
originated by tier-1 ISPs. Consequently, these networks are unlikely to be mali-
ciously announced. All other networks need to be further analyzed in order to
assess their threat level. To carry out this analysis, the next Section will be
focusing on uncovering the application-level services running in the blackspace
and seeking for hosts associated with malicious network activities.
3.3 Data Plane and Application-Level Analysis
A. Introduction. In the previous Sections, we have explored the routing-level
characteristics of blackspace networks. We have identiﬁed a small number of
network practices leading to benign blackspace announcements. In order to be
able to assess the security risk that is posed by the remaining set of blackspace
preﬁxes, we need to know more about their network activities, e.g. which
application-level services are running and whether they are known to be the
source of some malicious network traﬃc. For this, we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd out live

IP addresses and domain names, and we will then look at the services that
these machines are running and check them against logs of malicious network
activities. Table 1 summarizes our ﬁndings.
In order to discover live IP addresses, we lightly probed each of the blackspace
networks once per day in February and March 2015, except for ten days between
Feb 16 and Feb 26 when our modem broke down. Using zmap [7], we sent a
TCP SYN packet to each IP address included in a blackspace preﬁx on ports 21
(FTP), 22 (SSH), 25 (SMTP), 80 (HTTP), 137 (NetBios), 179 (BGP), and 443
(HTTPS). We run the scan from a machine located in AS3215 (Orange), and
wait for SYN/ACK replies. Please note that the number of ports that we can scan
is limited by the bandwidth we have been allowed to use for our experiments.
The particular choice of the port number reﬂects what we believe to be the most
popular services running on the Internet.
Figure 8 plots the number of SYN/ACK received per day and per port from
the blackspace. There is quite a large number of web servers running in the
blackspace. We customarily get replies from between 6 k and 8 k machines on
port 80, and 2.5 k machines on port 443. Next is port 22, with around 1 k daily
SYN/ACKs. There are around 100 FTP servers, and around 50 hits on port
179, suggesting that these IP addresses are border routers. Finally, we only get
a handful of TCP replies on the NetBios port, and no reply at all on port 25.
Figure 9 plots the variation of the live IP addresses in the blackspace, which
indicates the persistence of these IP addresses. As we can see, the variation is
quite high. These results need to be put into perspective of Fig. 4 which showed
that there was a very small variation in the blackspace networks. This suggests
that the hosts inside blackspace networks are not static, but dynamically come
and go. In other words, these networks appear to be actively conﬁgured, and not
left in a ‘legacy’ state.

B. Websites, URLs, and Domain Names. In the previous Section, we
located a set of highly volatile live IP addresses in the blackspace, and we saw
that we found thousands of web servers daily. In this Section, we look at the
contents of these websites and their associated URLs and domain names which
we match with a domain whitelist and blacklist. A simple way to know what’s
going on with these servers is to check the web page they serve. As a result, we
supplement our scan with a simple HTTP client that just fetches the default
page returned by the server, using the simple request GET / HTTP/1.0.
Using the returned HTTP headers, we ﬁnd that over 90 % of pages inside the
blackspace are served by an Apache server; then come IIS, and Cisco IOS. Other
pages are returned by nginx and lighthttpd, various application platforms, even
including a print server. Because we get thousands of pages per day, we cannot
manually go through all of them. In order to help our analysis, we used an unsu-
pervised machine learning tool that clustered our pages based on the similarity
of their raw content. We get between 60 and 80 clusters. The most important
one contains over 4000 Apache error pages. This implies that, for the most part,
the default page of web servers located in the blackspace is an Apache error
124
Q. Jacquemart et al.
page. Other clusters include default web pages of each HTTP daemon (e.g. your
installation was successful). Websites hosted in the blackspace are usually in
small clusters containing two or three IP addresses, which we checked in order
to conclude that they represent wide variety of websites. A number of login pages
are available, either to enter a conﬁguration interface (e.g. a router/printer con-
ﬁguration login page), but also web applications such as Microsoft applications
(e.g. Outlook Web Access), remote desktops (e.g. Citrix), content management
systems, and other proprietary corporate software. A large airline consistently
served their default web page. We also found some SME businesses, such as
technology ﬁrms (e.g. tier-3 ISPs and local shops), a second-hand car dealer, a
law ﬁrm, and a private security company. Finally, a small number of clusters
contained online forums. From the content of the topics available on the default
page, their content varied from standard community interest (e.g. online gam-
ing), to obvious copyright infringing ﬁle sharing boards. In some rare cases, the
retrieved page contained a lot of obfuscated JavaScript code. We used wepawet
[5,25] to check it out, and it always remained benign.
We further extracted from a passive DNS database we maintain all fully qual-
iﬁed domain names (FQDNs) that resolved to an IP address within a blackspace
IP preﬁx at the time the preﬁx was announced in BGP. We found a total 1,428
distinct FQDNs that accounted for 556 distinct domain names. We then checked
these domain names against various blacklists including Spamhaus DBL [17] and
VirusTotal [23]1 to search for scam, phishing or malware hosting activities asso-
ciated with them. We also used the Alexa top 10,000 domain names as a means
to determine whether some truly benign domains ended up being hosted on
blackspace IP address space.
The correlation yielded 35 domains deemed malicious by the queried black-
lists. These malicious domains were observed in no less than 222 diﬀerent
FQDNs, which appear to have resolved to 142 distinct IP addresses in 81 dis-
tinct blackspace IP address blocks. However, ﬁve domain names were also found
in the Alexa top 10,000 ranked websites suggesting they were most probably
benign. All of these were whitelisted, and belonged to well-known web appli-
cations, airlines, and technology companies. The remaining 516 domains could
not be classiﬁed as either benign or malicious. From these observations we can
see that while some blackspace announcements seem to be related to legitimate
activities, cybercriminals also appear to leverage such IP address space when
performing nefarious activities.
C. Malicious IP Addresses. In order to locate host-level malicious activities
inside blackspace preﬁxes, we were able to secure a list of malicious IP addresses
from a IP-based reputation system that we maintain for operational purposes.
These IP addresses were classiﬁed as either adware, phishing, scam, and other
kinds of miscellaneous activity.
We looked for IP addresses that were included in blackspace preﬁxes exclu-
sively on the days during which we detected the preﬁx in the blackspace. In
1 VirusTotal includes more than 60 diﬀerent website and domain scanning engines.
Demystifying the IP Blackspace
125
other words, we explicitly discarded any matching IP address and its covering
blackspace preﬁx where a match occurred outside of the blackspace period, even
if there were matches during the blackspace period. The reasoning behind this
(overly) strict matching is that we are looking for malicious activity that is the
result of an individual abusing the blackspace in order to remain hidden. Thus,
any matching malicious activity outside of the blackspace period could be argued
to be the result of a previous owner of the preﬁx, and not from the blackspace
itself. With these strict matches, we matched 46 malicious IP addresses in 28
distinct blackspace preﬁxes. Four of these IPs addresses were involved in scam
activities, and the remaining 42 others in phishing activities.
We then looked into these eight BGP preﬁxes to see if we could obtain more
information from the announcements. One of the BGP preﬁxes was reserved
and originated by an AS that was marked as available, through what appears
to be a tier-3 ISP in Thailand. Six of the other BGP preﬁxes were also all
reserved, and originated by registered ASes. Two of these were country-wide
ISPs, one was a television by satellite broadcaster, and one belonged to a hosting
provider. A European preﬁx was being announced by the AS of a Japanese
corporation, on which we were unable to ﬁnd any information.
The remaining BGP preﬁx is 192.0.0.0/2, which we had previously classi-
ﬁed as a route leak becaused it mached the descriptions in [11]. This preﬁx was
announced between October 15, 2014 and October 20, 2014. This announce-
ment resulted in an additional 2,970 preﬁxes in the blackspace (see Fig. 1).
Among these, 22 contain IP addresses marked as malicious, exactly during the
announcement period. More precisely, a single /24, as well as a /19, both contain
11 individual malicious IP addresses, a /22 contains ﬁve, a /20 contains two. The
remaining four IP addresses are spread across diﬀerent blackspace preﬁxes. It is
important to stress that the matches were done exclusively on the blackspace
period. Actually, none of these preﬁxes were routable before or after this leak.
The route also had a low visibility: it was only seen by 3 (out of 13) RIPE RIS
collector routers; and there is only one single AS path leading to the origin. The
origin AS was 65000, a private AS number (Fig. 6), and the route was propa-
gated through one cloud services and hosting provider, and then through a tier-3
ISP in the USA. Section 4 further discusses this peculiar situation.
D. Spam Campaigns. In an eﬀort to further characterize the footprints of
blackspace preﬁxes while they were announced and determine whether they pose
a security threat to the Internet, we extracted spam source IP addresses in these
preﬁxes that were blacklisted in Spamhaus SBL and DROP (Don’t Route Or
Peer) [17], Uceprotect [21], PSBL [13] and WPBL [24]. Furthermore, we retained
only those IP preﬁxes where spam activities were exclusively reported while the
preﬁxes were announced as blackspace to ensure that the observed activities
were not related to the previous or next status of the preﬁxes. We identiﬁed
a total of 206,404 distinct spam sources in 58 IP preﬁxes. Figure 10 shows the
BGP announcements and blacklisted spam sources related to a sample of 15 out
of 58 blackspace preﬁxes while they were announced as blackspace.
