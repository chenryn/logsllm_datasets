### Figure 7: Percentage of Blackspace Prefixes Originated by ASes According to Their Status

Since reserved and available ASes are not registered, we could not find registration information for them. Instead, we analyzed the BGP topology of these prefixes and investigated the evolution of blackspace prefixes over time.

- **Reserved ASes**: For 33% of the cases where a blackspace prefix is originated from a reserved AS, the origin AS remains reserved throughout the entire observation period. These networks are typically single-homed and peer either directly with a tier-1 provider or with a tier-3 provider.
- **State Transitions**: The remaining 66% of prefixes show a state transition from, or to, reserved. In all observed cases, this was due to a network owner either bringing up a new network or decommissioning an old one. For example, several blackspace prefixes were originated from a reserved AS for six months through a tier-1 AS. On one day, the AS status changed to assigned, and the name matched a well-known airline. The next day, the prefixes were given inetnum entries in the IRR. Our interpretation is that the prefixes and ASN were reserved for the growth of the airline, and they started using these resources before the paperwork was fully processed.
- **Another Case**: In another instance, the prefixes and ASN were allocated but later turned to reserved. By looking up the company’s name, we found a letter from ICANN informing the company that they had breached their registrar accreditation agreement by failing to meet technical requirements and by failing to pay the accreditation fees. The day after the letter, all of the company’s resources were changed to reserved.
- **Allocated to Reserved and Back**: In some cases, there are transitions from allocated to reserved and then back to allocated. We believe this situation is similar to the previous example, except that the company corrected its behavior during the grace period.
- **Available ASes**: There were only a few instances where the AS (and the announced blackspace prefix) ended up as allocated or assigned. These situations resulted from a new network being connected to the global Internet.

### Conclusion on Routing-Level Characteristics

By analyzing routing-level characteristics, we identified a set of blackspace prefixes that appear to be benign. Some prefixes are in the blackspace because they have just been allocated or are being phased out. Additionally, some blackspace networks are originated by tier-1 ISPs, making them unlikely to be maliciously announced. All other networks require further analysis to assess their threat level.

### 3.3 Data Plane and Application-Level Analysis

#### A. Introduction

In the previous sections, we explored the routing-level characteristics of blackspace networks and identified a small number of network practices leading to benign blackspace announcements. To assess the security risk posed by the remaining set of blackspace prefixes, we need to know more about their network activities, such as which application-level services are running and whether they are associated with malicious network traffic. We first need to identify live IP addresses and then examine the services running on these machines, checking them against logs of malicious network activities. Table 1 summarizes our findings.

#### B. Websites, URLs, and Domain Names

We located a set of highly volatile live IP addresses in the blackspace and found thousands of web servers daily. We examined the contents of these websites and their associated URLs and domain names, matching them with a domain whitelist and blacklist. A simple HTTP client was used to fetch the default page returned by the server using the request `GET / HTTP/1.0`.

- **Web Server Types**: Over 90% of pages inside the blackspace are served by an Apache server, followed by IIS and Cisco IOS. Other pages are served by nginx and lighthttpd, various application platforms, and even a print server.
- **Content Clustering**: Using an unsupervised machine learning tool, we clustered the pages based on the similarity of their raw content. The most significant cluster contained over 4,000 Apache error pages. Other clusters included default web pages of each HTTP daemon, login pages for configuration interfaces, and various web applications.
- **Domain Analysis**: We extracted fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that resolved to an IP address within a blackspace IP prefix at the time the prefix was announced in BGP. We found 1,428 distinct FQDNs, accounting for 556 distinct domain names. We checked these domain names against various blacklists, including Spamhaus DBL and VirusTotal, and the Alexa top 10,000 domain names. This yielded 35 domains deemed malicious, observed in 222 different FQDNs, resolving to 142 distinct IP addresses in 81 distinct blackspace IP address blocks. Five domain names were also found in the Alexa top 10,000, suggesting they were likely benign.

#### C. Malicious IP Addresses

To locate host-level malicious activities inside blackspace prefixes, we secured a list of malicious IP addresses from an IP-based reputation system. We looked for IP addresses included in blackspace prefixes exclusively during the days when the prefix was detected in the blackspace.

- **Matches**: We matched 46 malicious IP addresses in 28 distinct blackspace prefixes. Four of these IPs were involved in scam activities, and the remaining 42 in phishing activities.
- **BGP Prefix Analysis**: One BGP prefix was reserved and originated by an AS marked as available, through a tier-3 ISP in Thailand. Six other BGP prefixes were also reserved and originated by registered ASes, including country-wide ISPs, a television by satellite broadcaster, and a hosting provider. A European prefix was announced by the AS of a Japanese corporation, but no information was found.

#### D. Spam Campaigns

To further characterize the footprints of blackspace prefixes and determine their security threat, we extracted spam source IP addresses in these prefixes that were blacklisted in Spamhaus SBL and DROP, Uceprotect, PSBL, and WPBL. We retained only those IP prefixes where spam activities were reported exclusively while the prefixes were announced as blackspace.

- **Spam Sources**: We identified a total of 206,404 distinct spam sources in 58 IP prefixes. Figure 10 shows the BGP announcements and blacklisted spam sources related to a sample of 15 out of 58 blackspace prefixes while they were announced as blackspace.

This comprehensive analysis provides a detailed understanding of the nature and potential risks associated with blackspace prefixes, enabling more informed decisions regarding their management and security.
