User: How to use Ansible mirroring to remotely manage multiple servers? Please provide a specific playbook and explain what each step does.
Assistant: Ansible is an automation tool that can be used to remotely manage multiple servers. Through the Ansible image, we can run Ansible in the container and connect to multiple servers to execute commands or configurations. Here is an example playbook for remotely managing multiple servers using Ansible mirroring: ``` --- name: Configure Webservers hosts: webservers become: true vars: web_root: "/var/www/html" index_file: "index. html" tasks: - name: Install Apache apt: name: apache2 state: present - name: Configure Index template: src: index.tpl dest: "{{ web_root }}/{{ index_file }}" - name: Restart Apache service : name: apache2 state: restarted ``` This playbook assumes we have an Ansible hostgroup named "webservers" that contains multiple web servers to manage. The "become: true" directive in the playbook is used to elevate the Ansible user to administrator privileges in order to perform tasks that require root privileges. Two variables are defined in the Variables block, one for the web root directory and the other for the homepage filename. The "tasks" block contains three tasks. First, install Apache using the "apt" module. Then, use the "template" module to render the "index.tpl" file into the index.html file in the web root directory. Finally, restart Apache with the "service" module. This playbook can be run with the following command: ``` ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml ``` where "inventory_file" points to the Ansible inventory file for our hostgroup and playbook.yml is our playbook file. When running this command, Ansible will connect to all servers to perform tasks, namely install Apache, configure the home page, and then restart the Apache service.
