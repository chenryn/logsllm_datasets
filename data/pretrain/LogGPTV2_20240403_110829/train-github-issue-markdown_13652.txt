### Bug Report

When running `pip install matplotlib` on a Mac, the installation fails due to an error with the `kiwisolver` package. This issue appears to be related to a recent update of `kiwisolver` (see the [release history](https://pypi.org/project/kiwisolver/#history)). The relevant issue is tracked in [nucleic/kiwi#66](https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi/issues/66).

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create a new Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n kiwi-bug python=3.6
   ```

2. Activate the new environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate kiwi-bug
   ```
   (Alternatively, you can use `source activate kiwi-bug` if you are using an older version of Conda.)

3. Attempt to install `matplotlib`:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

**Expected Outcome:**
- `matplotlib` should install successfully.

**Actual Outcome:**
- The installation fails with an error related to `kiwisolver`.
