User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can't log into Windows, mac-spoofing issue or malware? My computer won't let me log into my account. On the Windows sign in screen it has my account name, but when I put in my password, it always says my password is wrong. No Caps Lock. 

This happened just after I configured MadMACs to "Run on Startup" and rebooted Windows! Can MadMACs change/corrupt Windows' login password? I'm using Windows 7 x64 Ultimate.  



Here's the MadMACs' source code

I already reinstalled Windows but I'm afraid if it was a malware some data might be stolen (bitcoin wallet and other important stuff).

Assistant: Well we may never know what the cause was but I would have dropped in the ophcrack livecd and at least checked to see if the password had changed.
