User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I log users' bash commands? I'm running a debian etch server where users will be logging into (hopefully) a chroot jail through ssh. How can I have the commands they execute logged in a way they cannot delete, nor prevent?

Assistant: install snoopy. If you only want to log the one user, do some syslog filtering fu.
