ABSTRACT
For Securing BGP Protocol, this paper proposes an identity-
based private key infrastructure (iPKI ) for managing self-
attested IP (sIP ) addresses. An sIP address endows the cur-
rent IP address self-attested characteristic, which does not
rely on any credential based PKI. Based on the sIP address,
we design the In-Band Self Origin Veriﬁcation (IBSOV ) pro-
tocol and self Route Origin Authorization (sROA) to provide
a lightweight origin veriﬁcation for the BGP protocol, which
has a much lower overhead than the existing works.

INTRODUCTION
In this work we propose a novel identity-based private key
infrastructure that mitigates the problem of preﬁx hijacking
in inter-domain routing with the help of self-attested Inter-
net number resources and origin routing validation.
The essence of solution to preﬁx hijacking problem is to
validate whether the AS is in reality authorized to advertise
a speciﬁc IP address. Several secure inter-domain routing
mechanisms have been proposed to relieve the preﬁx hijack-
ing problem in BGP protocol. Nevertheless, due to the com-
plexity and high-overhead authentication procedures, these
mechanisms often fall short of practicality. S-BGP [6] em-
ploys two PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) trees, four types
of certiﬁcates and two types of attestations to accomplish
route validation. However, S-BGP introduces high cost of
authentication framework because of the certiﬁcates and re-
vocation list maintaining. Moreover, it needs a separate
out-of-band certiﬁcate distribution mechanism, which brings

high deployment cost. Huston proposes RPKI (Resource
PKI) to attest to resource allocation and sign Route Origi-
nation Authorizations (ROAs) [5]. Although RPKI can eas-
ily attest a holder’s “right-of-use” of IP number resources by
using the extended X.509 certiﬁcate, it will lead to several
new kinds of vulnerabilities, such as malicious or uninten-
tionally means for IP preﬁx takedowns [2], path-shortening
attack [3]. Work on changes to RPKI speciﬁcations to pre-
vent abusing RPKI that downgrades routes in BGP is pro-
posed. However, the scholars also point out that it will in-
troduce large overheads to solve the preﬁx takedown prob-
lem [4]. Unlike the PKI-based mechanisms, the Accountable
IP (AIP) [1] proposes the self certiﬁed address that uses
the hash of a domain’s (host’s) public key as the domain’s
(host’s) address. The AIP self certiﬁed address does not
need any global trusted authority or credentials, which pro-
vides a simple solution to secure BGP protocol. However,
AIP is incompatible to the existing Internet architecture,
which makes it hardly possible to be deployed. On the other
hand, Wang et al. employs the Identity-based Cryptogra-
phy (IBC) to address the security issues in BGP protocol
[7]. They propose LAP mechanism and IDAPV mechanism
to verify origin AS and AS PATH authenticity, respectively.
However, the LAP requires the origin AS to publish As-
signment Path and Attestations (APAs) to repository to be
downloaded by any other ASes. And all ASes have to main-
tain a word-wide AS-preﬁxes map. Moreover, map in each
AS is supposed to renew timely so as to keep up-do-date.
Therefore, the LAP mechanism introduces too large mem-
ory and communication overhead to be practical. Besides,
the IDAPV mechanism using identity-based aggregate sig-
nature scheme to secure AS PATH is compromised to the
out-of-order AS PATH forgery.
In our work, we explore a novel lightweight authentication
framework to endow the current IP addresses self-attested
characteristics, and propose an incremental deployable and
eﬀective solution for BGP route origin validation. Speciﬁ-
cally, the main contributions of our work are: (1) we propose
an identity-based private key infrastructure called iPKI to
manage self-attested IP (sIP ) addresses. The iPKI elimi-
nates the use of certiﬁcates and third-party authentication,
which dramatically mitigates the complexity and the cost of
attesting identity-public key association. (2) we propose the
In-Band Self Origin Veriﬁcation (IBSOV ) protocol that ef-
fectively mitigate preﬁx hijacking problem, utilizing the sIP
addresses and a signed object named self Route Origin Au-
thorization (sROA). Comparing to the prior arts, the IBSOV
1632protocol introduces trivial overheads of veriﬁcation because
no extra data need to be transmitted out of band.

IPKI DESIGN AND UTILITY
In this section, the architecture of iPKI and the manage-
ment of sIP addresses are described, followed by the illumi-
nation of the IBSOV protocol.
2.1 Self-attested IP Address Infrastructure
We propose self-attested IP (sIP) address to lay the foun-
dation of secure routing protocol. Unlike the AIP which is
a redesign of IP structure and incompatible to the existing
IP protocol, an sIP address is an ordinary IP address that
can act as its public key and owns a corresponding private
key. We leverage the principle of Identity-based Cryptogra-
phy (IBC) [8] to assign IP the asymmetrical cryptographic
key pair. According to IBC, the sIP address’ private key
is generated by a trusted party, which is referred to as Pri-
vate Key Generator (PKG). IP PKGs are used to generate
private keys for sIP addresses in our work. Due to the self-
attested characteristic of sIP address, it is unnecessary for
the holder to use a certiﬁcate to attest the right-of-use of
the IP address. Thus trusted parties, such as Certiﬁcate
Authorities (CAs) used in RPKI, can be eliminated during
the route veriﬁcation procedures.
We establish hierarchical identity-based Private Key In-
frastructure (iPKI) to manage the private key assignment of
sIP addresses. Following the guide of the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA), IP addresses are generally as-
signed by authorized organizations in a hierarchical manner.
Derived from the IANA, each organization is assigned an al-
location of IP addresses and assigns a sub-allocation of IP
addresses to a lower-level organization. Paralleling to the IP
assignment architecture, the iPKI is also organized as a tree
hierarchy with a root IP PKG and lower-level IP PKGs in
diﬀerent tiers. The IANA is selected as the root, and any IP
address holder with the ability to further allocate address is
delegated as a domain IP PKG. While allocating IP address,
the IP PKG generates and assigns the corresponding private
key to the IP holder based on the hierarchical IBC (HIBC)
[8]. In addition, we propose a proved-security blinding tech-
nique to remove the secure channel for key distribution [8].
Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the hierarchical IP address
and private key allocation.
Besides the private key allocation, the iPKI also utilizes
the keys to provide signing and veriﬁcation algorithm. More
concretely, the iPKI consists of the following algorithms:
• Setup (k → P arams). The setup algorithm is run
by the root IP PKG (the IANA). It takes a security
