SecurityPolicy
· A high-level statement of purpose and intent
· Answers three essential questions:
· Who should be allowed access?
· To what system and organizational resources should access be
allowed?
· What types of access should each user be allowed for each
resource?
· Should specify
. The organization's security goals (e.g., define whether reliable
service is a higher priority than preventing infiltration)
· Where the responsibility for security lies (e.g., the security group or
the user)
. The organization's commitment to security (e.g., defines where the
security group fits in the corporate structure)

Assessment of Current Security Status
· A risk analysis-a systemic investigation of the
system, its environment, and what might go
wrong—forms the basis for describing the current
security state
· Defines the limits of responsibility for security
· Which assets are to be protected
. Who is responsible for protecting them
· Who is excluded from responsibility
· Boundaries of responsibility

## Page 6
SecurityRequirements
· Security requirements are functional or performance demands
placed on a system to ensure a desired level of security
· Usually derived from organizational business needs,
sometimes including compliance with mandates imposed from
outside, such as government standards
· Characteristics of good security requirements:
· Correctness
· Consistency
·Completeness
· Realism
· Need
·Verifiability
.Traceability

Responsibilityfor Implementation
· A section of the security plan will identify which people (roles) are
responsible for implementing security requirements
. Common roles:
· Users of personal computers or other devices may be responsible for the
security of their own machines. Alternatively, the security plan may designate
· Managers may be responsible for seeing that the people they supervise
implement security measures.
· Database administrators may be responsible for the access to and integrity of
data in their databases.
·Information officers may be responsible for overseeing the creation and use of
data; these officers may also be responsible for retention and proper disposal
ofdata.
· Personnel staff members may be responsible for security involving employees,
for example, screening potential employees for trustworthiness and arranging
security training programs.

Timetable and Plan Maintenance
· As a security plan cannot be implemented instantly, the
plan should include a timetable of how and when the
elementsinitwillbeperformed
. The plan should specify the order in which controls are to
be implemented so that the most serious exposures are
coveredas soon aspossible
. The plan must be extensible, as new equipment will be
acquired, new connectivity requested, and new threats
identified
. The plan must include procedures for change and growth
·. The plan must include a schedule for periodic review

Security Planning Team Members
· Security planning touches every aspect of an organization
and therefore requires participation well beyond the
security group
. Common security planning representation:
· Computer hardware group
· System administrators
· Systems programmers
·Applications programmers
· Data entry personnel
·.Physical security personnel
· Representative users

Assuring Commitment to a Security Plan
· A plan that has no organizational commitment collects
dust on a shelf
· Three groups of people must contribute to making the
plan asuccess:
affectedby the plan.
· Those affected by the security recommendations must understand
 s   lm  m a  sa id a rm
perform their business activities. In particular, they must see how
what they do can affect other users and other systems.
 Management must be committed to using and enforcing the
security aspects of the system.

Business Continuity Planning
· A business continuity plan documents how a
business will continue to function during or after a
computer security incident
· Addresses situations having two characteristics:
· Catastrophic situations, in which all or a major part of a
computing capability is suddenly unavailable
Long duration, in which the outage is expected to last
for so long that business will suffer

Continuity Planning Activities
· Assess the business impact of a crisis
· What are the essential assets?
· What could disrupt use of these assets?
· Develop a strategy to control impact
· Investigate how the key assets can be safeguarded
· Develop and implement a plan for the strategy
·Define:
· Who is in charge when an incident occurs
· What to do when an incident occurs
· Who does what tasks when an incident occurs

Incident Response Plans
· A security incident response plan tells the staff how to
deal with a security incident
· In contrast to a business continuity plan, the goal of
incident response is handling the current security incident
without direct regard for the business issues
· An incident response plan should
· Define what constitutes an incident
· Identify who is responsible for taking charge of the situation
· Describe the plan of action
---
## Page 15

Incident ResponseTeams
· The response team is charged with responding to the
incident. It may include
· Director : The person in charge of the incident, who decides what
actions to take
· Technicians: People who perform the technical part of the response
· Advisors: Legal, human resources, or public relations staff
members as appropriate
· Matters to consider when identifying a response team?
· Legal issues
· Preserving evidence
· Records
· Public relations

CSIRTS
· Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSlRT) are
teams trained and authorized to handle security incidents
· Responsibilities of a CSIRT include
· Reporting: Receiving reports of suspected incidents and reporting
as appropriate to senior management
· Detection: Investigation to determine if an incident occurred
 Triage: Immediate action to address urgent needs
Response: Coordination of effort to address all aspects in a manner
appropriate to severity and time demands
· Postmortem: Declaring the incident over and arranging to review
the case to improve future response
· Education: Preventing harm by advising on good security practices
and disseminating lessons learned from past incidents

RiskAnalysis
· Risk analysis is an organized process for identifying the
most significant risks in a computing environment,
determining the impact of those risks,and weighing the
desirability of applying various controls against those risks
·A risk is a potential problem that the system or its users
mayexperience
· Characteristics of a risk:
· Associated loss (also known as a risk impact)
· Likelihood of occurring
· Degree to which we can change the outcome (risk control)
· We can theoretically quantify the effects of a risk, or risk
exposure, by multiplying likelihood by risk impact

Strategies for Dealing with Risk
· Avoid the risk by changing requirements for security or
other system characteristics
. Transfer the risk by allocating the risk to other systems.
people, organizations, or assets or by buying insurance to
· Assume the risk by accepting it, controlling it with
available resources, and preparing to deal with the loss if

Step 1: Identify Assets
·Hardware: Processors, boards, keyboards, monitors, terminals,
microcomputers, workstations, tape drives, printers, disks, disk drives, cables,
connections, communications controllers, and communications media
· Software: Source programs, object programs, purchased programs, in-house
compilers), and maintenance diagnostic programs
archival data, updatelogs, and audit records
· People: Skilled staff needed to run the computing system or specific
programs, as well as support personnel such as guards
· Documentation: On programs, hardware, systems, administrative procedures,
andtheentiresystem
well as power, heating and cooling, and necessary buildings or shelter
·Reputation: Company image
· Availability: Ability to do business, ability to resume business rapidly and
efficiently after an incident

Step 3: Estimate Likelihood of Exploitation
· Because it is impossible to know all of a system's
vulnerabilities or all the ways those vulnerabilities can be
exploited,isalso impossibletoaccurately assess
likelihoodofexploitation
· Possible approaches to estimation:
· Apply frequency probability using observed data for a similar
system
· Use an analyst familiar with such systems to estimate number of
occurrences in a given time period
· Use descriptive adjectives or a simple rating system
. The Delphi approach

Step 4: ComputeExpected Loss
. In addition to the obvious costs, such as the cost to
replace a hardware asset, there are hidden costs:
· Cost of restoring the system to a previous state
· Cost of downtime
· Legal fees
· Loss of reputation and confidence
· Loss of confidentiality
· Some hidden costs may be impossible to accurately
evaluate, but considering them will nonetheless aid in risk
management

Step 5: Survey and Select New Controls
· Once you understand your assets, vulnerabilities.
estimated likelihood of exploitation, and cost of
exploitation, you have enough information to select
controls
· Each vulnerability may have one or more controls
associated with it, and each control may work for many
assetsandmultiplevulnerabilities
· One approach is to use graph theory to select a minimal
set of controls to address all vulnerabilities
---
## Page 27

Step 6: Project Costs and Savings
. This step is meant to determine whether the costs of
implementing controls outweigh the expected benefits
· The effective cost of a given control is the actual cost of
the control (including purchase price, installation and
deployment costs, and training costs) minus the expected
loss the control is expected to prevent
or introduces new risks to the system, or it may be
negative if the expected reduction in risk is greater than
the cost of the control

Summary
· A security plan is both an official record of current security
practices and a blueprint for orderly change to improve
thosepractices
· Business contingency and incident response planning
help establish an orderly, carefully considered response to
emergenclesand other securityincidents
· Risk analysis is a complex and imperfect process but
forces an organization to carefully consider important
assets, vulnerabilities, risks, and control options
Prepare for disasters by contingency planning, insuring
assets, backing up data, and deploying failover sites
