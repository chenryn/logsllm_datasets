utility on the Android platform. By means of an Android
tool, called CloakDroid, they show that providing applica-
tions with less precise locations does not substantially hinder
their functionality. A more encompassing approach, taken by
Henne et al. [14], enables Android users to specify different
obfuscation algorithms for each Android application, including
location truncation.
As users are not able to anticipate the privacy threats
against them caused by the information they share, there are
several attempts to formalize the desirable location privacy
requirements that obfuscation mechanisms should fulﬁll and
the metrics to quantify them. Examples of such pieces of
work are Krumm [19], Decker [8], and Duckham [9]. In
a follow-up of these works, Shokri et al. provide a frame-
work [30] to quantify location privacy, and a game-theoretic
methodology [31] to optimize location privacy while respect-
ing users’ utility requirements. Despite all the efforts to design
obfuscation mechanisms and quantify their effect on users’
location privacy, no methodology is proposed for quantitatively
estimating the utility loss caused by different obfuscation
mechanisms. Few studies that include utility aspects of location
obfuscation mechanisms only reﬂect the application dimension
of it, for example, by measuring the fraction of restaurants
that a user misses, or the error of trafﬁc information due to
location perturbation [15], [23]. Our work completes this line
of studies, by providing a methodology to design user-centric
utility functions for location check-ins.
III. SURVEY AND DATA COLLECTION
In this work, we investigate (on a per-check-in basis)
the effect of geographical and semantic location obfuscation
(i.e., generalization) on the perceived utility of (Foursquare)
check-ins. In order to better understand users’ behaviors and
preferences when they check into venues, we ran a user study
in early 2014. The study consists of a personalized online
survey, where participants are asked to provide additional in-
formation about their past check-ins on Foursquare. Foursquare
is a very popular location-based mobile social network (unlike
Facebook, users can only check-in from their mobile devices),
whose primary feature is to check-in to venues: From the
Foursquare mobile application or website, users can select a
venue close to their current location (from the Foursquare
database) and share their presence at
this venue, possibly
together with a text message and some pictures.3 Each venue
is associated with a street address and a semantic tag (from
a predeﬁned set of tags, organized as a tree). Foursquare also
provides incentives (e.g., badges, “mayorship”, and rewards
upon check-in) and gaming features (e.g., treasure hunts in
which participants must check-in at speciﬁc venues).
In the survey, we ask the participants to state the purpose of
some of their past Foursquare check-ins, as well as to specify
to what extent their purpose would still be met if their check-
ins were obfuscated at several levels (both geographical and
semantic). Our ﬁndings are then used to evaluate an automated
system that predicts the purpose and the extent to which such
a purpose would still be met, if the original check-in were
replaced by an obfuscated version of it.
In the following subsections, we discuss the details about
the participants and the contents of the survey.
A. Participants and Remuneration
To recruit participants, we made use of the Amazon Me-
chanical Turk (MTurk) platform, which allowed us to draw
candidates from a pool of users with diverse backgrounds and
to limit the bias of the results towards academic and student
behavior, inherent to on-campus surveys. We screened partici-
pants according to the following criteria: (i) aged between 18
and 80 years, (ii) with an active Foursquare account, (iii) with
at least 75 check-ins over the last 24 months, (iv) with at least
20 check-ins containing some text. Furthermore, to ensure a
minimal level of diversity in the check-ins, we allowed only
the participants who had checked-in to at least 15 different
venues, stemming from at least 5 different venue types (with
at least 2 different venues for each type). Note that we only
considered venues that have both precise geographic and se-
mantic information, and that have a non-negligible number of
unique visitors. Moreover, we screened the MTurk participants
according to their past performance on the platform: They had
to have a minimum Human Intelligence Task (HIT) approval
rate of 95% and at least 100 past approved HITs. This was a
preliminary step to preventing inexperienced and non-serious
workers from participating in our survey.
Our survey is based on the participants’ actual check-ins on
Foursquare posted over the last 24 months (that we collected
through a speciﬁc application we developed), and it requires
a signiﬁcant amount of time to complete (30-45 minutes). To
encourage the participants to participate in the survey and to
grant us access to their Foursquare data, we rewarded them
with a ﬁxed amount of money (US $4.5 per HIT [2], [22]). At
the end of the study, the average per-hour remuneration for the
participants was US $8.50. The total budget for the experiment
was $600.
3We chose Foursquare because of its popularity and because check-ins
constitute its main feature. Moreover, its API allowed us to easily access
all the information required to generate the survey.

B. Online Survey
The survey, divided into two parts, was composed of a
total of 68 questions. In the ﬁrst part, participants replied
to 18 questions pertaining to general demographics, as well
as technology and location-sharing habits. The remaining 45
questions were constructed by using information collected
from the users’ own Foursquare check-ins.
Before beginning the survey, the participants were pre-
sented with a welcome page that indicated the scope and
purpose of the study. After agreeing with the privacy and data
use policies4, they were asked to log in to their Foursquare
account and grant us access to their check-ins and friend
lists. After this step, our application veriﬁed if the participants
actually fulﬁlled the admission criteria and, if so, it allowed
them to continue to the ﬁrst (static) set of questions.
Following the ﬁrst part, the participants were presented
with the second (personalized) part of the survey, where they
answered a set of 9 questions for each of the 45 check-ins,
totaling 405 personalized questions. For each of their check-
ins, the participants were presented with the time of the check-
in, the venue (its name and its location displayed on a map),
and the associated text message, if any (see Figure 1).5
important detail
These questions allowed participants to select one answer
per question item, among a set of pre-deﬁned choices. We
asked participants to state (1) the primary and (optionally)
secondary purpose of the check-in, (2) whether the text in the
check-in is related to the location, (3) the extent to which the
purpose of the check-in would still be met if it were replaced
by a less detailed check-in (we had four different versions
with varying levels of geographical and semantic obfuscation),
(4) the most
in the check-in and (5) the
most similar check-in in terms of purpose, among two other
suggested check-ins present in the user’s own questions. In
particular, for (1) we allowed users to either select one among
a set of 13 proposed choices (based on [27], [28] and our
internal experiment) or to specify a different one in free-text.
We considered two levels of obfuscation (low and high),
both at the geographical and at the semantic levels. Geographic
obfuscation reveals only some of the geographic information
(among the street number, street name, zip code, city, state,
and country); semantic obfuscation reveals only an ancestor,
in Foursquare’s semantic hierarchy, of the semantic tag of the
venue (in our dataset, semantic tags have 3 to 4 ancestors). The
four combinations of obfuscation levels are deﬁned as follows
and are illustrated on a sample venue in Table I:

2)
Low semantic obfuscation, Low geographical obfus-
cation (Ls-Lg): Instead of the full venue information,
we show only the immediate ancestor in the semantic
hierarchy of the venue, and we display only the street
name/city/state/country (without the street number).
(Hs-Lg): We
High semantic, Low geographical
show the second ancestor, and display the street
name/city/state/country.
4They approve a data retention and processing agreement, informing them
that all data collected in our study is used solely for the purpose of our
academic research project, and that we will not disclose or use it in any other
way than what is explicitly mentioned.
5Note that we did not include the pictures associated with the check-ins; in
our dataset, only 6% of the check-ins contained pictures.

Geographical obfuscation relies on the Google Geocoding
API to convert the venue addresses to a structured format
(street number, street name, zipcode, city, state, country),
whereas semantic obfuscation relies on the tree structure of the
set of tags provided by Foursquare. Table I shows an example
of a check-in with the four alternatives, where a participant has
to state, on a discrete 5-point scale (where 1 means “Not at
all” and 5 means “Perfectly”), the extent to which her purpose
would still be met if her original check-in were replaced by
each of the alternative ones. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of
our survey website for a sample check-in.
In order to detect and discard sloppy answers, we per-
formed two tests: time analysis and purpose diversity. For both
parts of the survey, we analyzed how long it took participants
to complete them, and we discarded the participants whose
timings were lower than twice the standard deviation around
the mean time. Regarding the diversity in the stated pur-
pose, we retained participants who chose at least two distinct
purposes at least twice in their answers. To avoid wasting
participants’ time, we did not
include “dummy” questions
in the survey, as our previous experience showed they were
answered correctly, even by the participants who provided
sloppy answers.

create a set of 13 dummy binary variables {md}13
d=1 to encode
the 13 possible purposes; similarly, we generate 4 dummy
variables for the time of the day to encode 5 different possibili-
ties (morning, noon, etc.). Moreover, we take into account the
correlation and mutual dependence between obfuscation and
purpose by having them appear as factors in the regression
function. In the end, we obtain 13 binary variables for the
purpose (md), 3 variables for the obfuscation levels (os·og, os,
og) and 23 for the venue and user characteristics, where each
of the 7 variables ki is converted to several binary variables
k(j). The linear regression function is deﬁned as:
ulin(m, o, k) =a0 + (
13(cid:2)
23(cid:2)
bd · md) + (
cj · k(j))+
d=1
e0 · os · og + e1 · og + e2 · os
j=1
where a0, bi, ci, ei are the coefﬁcients that we estimate by
using the least squares method. Second, we use the WEKA
toolkit in order to evaluate the non-linear model and ascertain
whether there is a signiﬁcant difference between the two
models. We expect the non-linear model to perform better than
the linear one; however, the linear model will provide us with
results that can be interpreted on a per-feature basis, and will
allow us to compare their relative coefﬁcients in the regression
function, as shown hereafter.
A. Linear Model of Utility vs. Purpose
1) Actual Purpose vs. Utility: In this scenario, we consider
the actual reported purposes of the check-ins when optimizing
the regression coefﬁcients. Hence, the purpose vector m is a
binary vector, where there is at most one occurrence of the
value 1 for each such vector.
The linear model achieves a R2 = 0.20, with a mean error
of 1.19 over the range [1, 5], and a p-value < .01. In terms of
motivation coefﬁcients, we observe that the largest has a value
−0.63 (p < .01) for the purpose “inform about people around
me”, whereas the only one that has a positive effect on utility
is “say that I like it”, with a value of 0.41 (p < .01). In general,
most motivation predictors are signiﬁcant, although they have
a relatively small contribution (< −0.3) on the overall utility.
With respect to the coefﬁcients for the semantic and geographic
obfuscation, we observe that both of them have a negative
effect on utility (−0.73 and −0.40, respectively). However,
there is also a clear difference in their magnitudes: The one for
the semantic obfuscation is almost two times higher than the
one for the geographic obfuscation. In this respect, our ﬁndings
corroborate the prior results in [27], [28], by quantifying the
impact on the utility of both different motivations and levels
of detail [26] for real Foursquare check-ins.
Overall, the regression results show that when the actual
purposes are known, the linear model does not achieve good
results in terms of ﬁt, and it still maintains a modest mean error
over the considered range. It shows, however, how some of the
motivations and obfuscation parameters are indeed signiﬁcant
for the prediction of utility.
