Log monitoring: - Enable logging to record system operations, login and error messages, etc. - Regularly analyze logs to discover potential security threats and anomalies. 6. Use encryption technology: - Use SSL/TLS encryption protocol to ensure the security of external communication. - Use file encryption technology to protect the security of sensitive files. 7. Disable unnecessary services: - Turn off unnecessary services to reduce the attack surface of the system. - Disable dangerous and non-standard commands to avoid malicious attacks. 8. Regularly back up data: - Regularly back up system and application data and files to ensure data security. - Store backup data in a safe place to prevent data leakage or loss.
