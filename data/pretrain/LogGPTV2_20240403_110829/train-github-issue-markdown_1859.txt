why the number of vertices is being rendered 8 or 9 times more than the actual
number can it be simplified or at least rendered the same? Is the WebGl taking
additional resources for vertices?
Also I tried lots of simplifiers but even after simplifying still not reaching
the target which is 30000 vertices.  
the current number is around 260000 vertices
