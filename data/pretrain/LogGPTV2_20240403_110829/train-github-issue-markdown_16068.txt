# Environment
    Windows build number: [19041.330]
    PowerToys version: v0.19.0
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): PowerToys Run
# Steps to reproduce
Altering the shortcut of PowerToys Run to ‘Win’ key + letter key will cause
shortcut conflicts.  
If you change the shortcut to 'Win+R' and trigger it, the 'Start' will pop up
sometimes.  
When you press the key quickly, the probability of this situation is very
high.
