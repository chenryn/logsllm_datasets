Question: "A web application uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch and display content based on the URL's hash fragment. An attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL where the hash fragment points to a malicious site that sends back a payload with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set to the victim's domain. What is the security flaw in the application, and how should it be addressed?"
 "A": "The flaw is that the application improperly validates the `location.hash` before using it in a CORS request, which can lead to the execution of malicious scripts. The application should implement strict input validation and sanitization on the URL fragment before usage."
 "B": "The application flaw is the use of `XMLHttpRequest`, which is less secure than the Fetch API. The application should switch to using the Fetch API with built-in security features to mitigate this flaw."
 "C": "The security flaw is in the server configuration that allows any origin in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, not in the application itself. The server should be configured to only allow known origins."
 "D": "There is no flaw in the application because CORS requests are inherently safe due to the browser's same-origin policy. The attack scenario described is not feasible."
Answer: A
