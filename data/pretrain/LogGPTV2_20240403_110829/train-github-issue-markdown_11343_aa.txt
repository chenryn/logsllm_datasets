## 🐛 Bug
code: E1866  
file: ArrayRef.h  
desc: attribute does not apply to any entity  
line: 278  
line 278: C10_DEFINE_DEPRECATED_USING(IntList, ArrayRef)
## To Reproduce
Download the latest stable or nightly build of libtorch, no cuda. Make a new
C++ Project in Visual Studio 2017, import additional includes and libs:  
C:\Users\XX\Documents\libtorch\include\torch\csrc\api\include;  
C:\Users\XX\Documents\libtorch\include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)  
C:\Users\XX\Documents\libtorch\lib;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)
Make a new .cpp file in the Project called 'example-app.cpp'. Put the code
from example-app example on:
https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html#minimal-example
Go to Project properties -> C/C++ Language -> Conformance mode -> No.  
This is done according to supposed fix on: #19336
## Expected behavior
I expected it to compile without errors.
## Environment
I guess that the enviornment refers to python enviornemnt only?
  * PyTorch Version (e.g., 1.0): Tried 1.4 and nightly
  * OS (e.g., Linux): Windows 7 64 bit
  * How you installed PyTorch (`conda`, `pip`, source): downloaded the zip on get started and extraced.
  * Build command you used (if compiling from source): No commands, clicked "Local Windows Debugger" to start
  * Python version: 3.6.6
  * CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
  * GPU models and configuration: N/A
  * Any other relevant information: N/A
## Additional context
When I try to compile with this error on libtorch 1.4 (followed by nightly) I
