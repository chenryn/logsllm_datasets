Is it possible to build a subset of babel to just use the `transform` function
for compiling es6/es7/jsx to js in the browser, does it generally have to be
this huge? Are there any tricks for using it with webpack?
`JSXTransformer` and `react-tools` are going away and babel seems to remain
the only available option for transpiling JSX in the browser, however it's 10
times bigger than those two which is often quite a problem.
