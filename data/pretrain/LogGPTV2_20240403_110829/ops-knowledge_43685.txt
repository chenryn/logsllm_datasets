User: How to do code version control? Please introduce a common version control tool.
Assistant: Code version control is the process used to manage and track all code changes in a software development project. Among them, the most commonly used version control tool is Git. Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds that allows multiple people to work together, track code changes, merge code, etc. Git has the following characteristics: 1. Git has a powerful and flexible branch function, which can quickly create and switch branches, allowing developers to experiment and develop on their own branches without affecting others. 2. Git has a localized version control function that centralized version control tools do not have, and it can be used without networking. 3. Git has the characteristics of high security, easy expansion, fast speed, and very convenient to use. The steps to use Git for version control are as follows: 1. Create a Git repository. 2. Add files to the repository. 3. Commit the file to the repository. 4. Use branches for code development. 5. Push the code to the remote server. 6. Merge the branches. 7. Pull the latest code. 8. Resolve conflicts. 9. Roll back the code. In short, Git is a very useful version control tool, which can greatly simplify the process of code management and collaboration, and improve the efficiency of software development.
