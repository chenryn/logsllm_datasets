### Cross-Analysis of Botnet Victims: New Insights and Implications

#### 1. Introduction to Manhattan Distance
The Manhattan Distance between two items is the sum of the absolute differences of their feature values. It is commonly used to measure the similarity between two data distributions. For example, if the Manhattan Distance between the data distributions of A and B is smaller than that between A and C, it indicates that A and B are more similar to each other than A and C.

Formally, the Manhattan Distance between two distributions \( x \) and \( y \), each with \( n \) elements, can be defined as:
\[
\text{Manhattan Distance} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|
\]

#### 2. Application to Botnet Infection Distributions
We applied the Manhattan Distance to the probability distributions of infected networks for the Conficker, MegaD, and Srizbi botnets over IP address spaces. The results are as follows:
- Manhattan Distance between Conficker and MegaD: 1.1427
- Manhattan Distance between Conficker and Srizbi: 1.1604
- Manhattan Distance between MegaD and Srizbi: 0.8404

From these results, we observe that the distance between Type I (Conficker) and Type II (MegaD and Srizbi) botnet distributions is larger than the distance between the two Type II botnets. This suggests that the infection patterns of botnets with the same type (Type II) are more similar to each other than those of different types.

#### 3. Insights and Predictive Capabilities
This finding provides an insight that if two botnets share the same infection vectors (i.e., they are of the same type), the distribution patterns of their infected networks are likely to be similar. This similarity can be leveraged to predict unknown infected networks of one botnet using the historical data of another botnet of the same type.

To verify this, we performed a cross-prediction test where we used the training data from one botnet and the testing data from another. The results, shown in Table 4, indicate that this approach can predict unknown infected networks with over 83% accuracy.

| **Botnet** | **Training (train), Testing (test)** | **K** | **Prediction Accuracy** | **False Positive Rate** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| MegaD(train), Srizbi(test) | 1 | 87.80% | 7.41% |
| MegaD(train), Srizbi(test) | 3 | 86.75% | 7.49% |
| MegaD(train), Srizbi(test) | 5 | 86.45% | 7.69% |
| Srizbi(train), MegaD(test) | 1 | 84.09% | 6.53% |
| Srizbi(train), MegaD(test) | 3 | 83.89% | 6.31% |
| Srizbi(train), MegaD(test) | 5 | 83.65% | 5.09% |

#### 4. Practical Example
Consider a network administrator who has historical data on infected networks by the Srizbi botnet. If a new botnet, such as MegaD, starts spreading, the administrator can use the Srizbi data to predict which networks are likely to be infected by MegaD. This predictive capability can help in early detection and mitigation of potential infections.

#### 5. Limitations and Discussions
Our study, like any empirical analysis, has some limitations. We have a relatively smaller amount of data for the MegaD and Srizbi botnets compared to Conficker, which might introduce some bias. Additionally, the dynamic nature of IP addresses can lead to overestimation. To mitigate these effects, we generalized our analysis over /24 subnets instead of individual hosts.

We also leveraged previous work to obtain information on the distribution of dynamic IP addresses over countries, although this information is not complete. Despite these limitations, the provided insights are still valuable for understanding and predicting botnet behavior.

#### 6. Related Work
Several studies have analyzed the victim distributions of specific botnets. CAIDA and Krishnan et al. provided detailed analyses of the Conficker botnet, while Mori et al. and John et al. focused on the Srizbi and MegaD botnets, respectively. Our work differs in that we perform a cross-analysis of different botnets and propose a cross-prediction method for early warning systems.

#### 7. Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we conducted a large-scale cross-comparison analysis of different botnets, revealing interesting findings and insights into botnet victims. Our results show fine-grained infection information and highlight the relationship between geopolitical issues and malware infection. This study can guide the design of better botnet prediction and defense systems.

In future work, we will explore new approaches to explain the relationships between geopolitical locations and malware infection more clearly. We will also collect more botnet data to investigate diverse categories and discover correlations with different malware infection types.
