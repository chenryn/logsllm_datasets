### Example Code
    val = 1    
    async def functionOne(self) -> JSONResponse:
            try:
                await addOne(); // adds one to value.
                return JSONResponse(status_code=200, content={"message": "example"})
            except ValueError as e:
                return JSONResponse(status_code=400, content={"message": e.args[0]})
    router.get('/example')(self.functionOne)
### Description
the value of the val should be 2 but getting 3 because I am getting duplicate
requests in a single hit.
