User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Force Dovecot not to log connect/disconnect messages My /var/log/mail.log gets constantly flooded with Dovecot connect/disconnect messages like this:

Mar 29 18:15:48 summit dovecot: IMAP(foo@bar.baz): Disconnected: Logged out bytes=63/2126          
Mar 29 18:15:50 summit dovecot: imap-login: Login: user=&lt;baz@bar.foo&gt;, method=PLAIN, rip=4.3.2.1, lip=1.2.3.4, TLS


These are repeated ad infinitum (to the tune of 11MB of logs per day), and they're obscuring the more important authentication failures and Postfix deliveries/receptions. I've checked Dovecot's wiki page for logging, but no option there stops these messages. Is there any configuration variable I can set within dovecot.conf to stop these messages being sent to mail.log?

Clarification: I still want Dovecot to log to mail.log; I just don't want it logging these frivolous connect/disconnect messages.

Assistant: If you are using rsyslog or syslog-ng you can filter syslog messages. Here is an example from the rsyslog help:

with a simple statement:

:msg, contains, "imap-login" ~


or with the if-else script language:

if $programname == 'dovecot' then {
   action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/dovecot.log")
   if $msg contains 'imap-login' then
     action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/dovecot-login.log")
   else
     action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/dovecot.log")
}
