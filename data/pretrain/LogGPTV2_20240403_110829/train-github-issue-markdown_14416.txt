Google Chrome Extension does not work anymore.
Google Chrome is up to date  
Version 83.0.4103.116 (Official Build) (64-bit)
Most of the time, the new developer tabs never show up.
If I kill the whole process and re-load it, sometimes it will load, sometimes
it doesn't.
The plugin has access to all data on all sites.
Was this plugin ever updated to use the new plugin format?
Note: I didn't initially realize this is the entire react project and not the
dev tools plugin. Not sure why the dev tools plugin page in Chrome sent me
here for support.
