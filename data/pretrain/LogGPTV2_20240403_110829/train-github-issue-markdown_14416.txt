I am experiencing an issue with a Google Chrome Extension, which has ceased to function. My version of Google Chrome is up to date (Version 83.0.4103.116, Official Build, 64-bit). Most of the time, the new developer tabs do not appear at all. When I terminate the entire process and reload it, the extension sometimes works, but often it does not.

The plugin in question has access to all data on all websites. I am unsure if this plugin was ever updated to comply with the latest plugin format.

Additionally, I initially did not realize that this was an entire React project rather than just a developer tools plugin. I'm also uncertain why the dev tools plugin page in Chrome directed me here for support.
