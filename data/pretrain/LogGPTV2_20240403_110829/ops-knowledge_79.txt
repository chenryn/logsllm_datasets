User: Please write an Ansible script to automate the process of deploying Docker containers on multiple servers.
Assistant: Here is a sample Ansible script: ```yaml --- - name: Deploy Docker containers to multiple servers hosts: all tasks: - name: Install Docker become: true apt: name: docker.io state: present - name: Start Docker service become: true service: name: docker state: started - name: Pull Docker image become: true docker_image: name: {{ image_name }} source: pull - name: Create Docker container become: true docker_container: name: {{ container_name }} image: {{ image_name }} state: started ``` This script: 1. Install Docker on all hosts and start the Docker service 2. Obtain the specified image from the Docker mirror warehouse 3. Create Docker on each host Container, and use the specified image to start the container You need to replace the following parameters with actual values: - `image_name`: the name of the Docker image, such as `nginx` or `alpine` - `container_name`: the name of the Docker container to be created , such as `webserver` or `database`
