some encouraging news. Although hundreds of organizations
are responsible for invalid IP preﬁxes, most of the errors
are caused by a small number of organizations, as shown in
Figure 14. Speciﬁcally, only 20 organizations are responsible
for issuing the ROAs causing 50% of the errors. We discuss
the signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding, in terms of driving RPKI
deployment, in Section VII.
B. Inter-Organization Dependencies
Another potential reason for the disappointingly small
number of ROAs in RPKI are inter-organization dependencies
that arise when to issue an RC and/or ROA for a preﬁx an
organization must wait for other organizations to take action
ﬁrst. Two such dependencies exist: upward and downward.
The upward dependency is for issuing RCs: the RC for
preﬁx p must be signed by an entity already in possession
of a valid RC for a super-preﬁx containing p. Figure 15
illustrates the hierarchical structure of RPKI and the inter-
organizational upward dependencies that it entails. Level 3
Communications is one of the largest ISPs worldwide. It
was allocated its IP addresses directly from ARIN, the RIR
for North-America, but did not issue an RC. Consequently,
over 500 other organizations are unable to obtain RCs and
issue ROAs to protect
their thousands of preﬁxes. These
organizations include, for example, Twitter, LinkedIn, and
eBay, as illustrated in Figure 15.
The downward dependency is for issuing ROAs: if a preﬁx
p originates from some AS a, but p has a subpreﬁx ¯p that
originates from a different AS b (belonging to a different
organization), then publishing a ROA specifying a as the origin
AS of p, before a ROA specifying b as the origin AS of ¯p,
would invalidate BGP advertisements of ¯p, as in the example
of Orange and its customers in Figure 11. (See discussion in
Section II on issuing RCs and ROAs.)
We next investigate the extent to which upward and down-
ward dependencies explain the slow adoption of RPKI. Our
results show that while there are not many inter-organizational
dependencies, downward dependencies pose obstacles to RPKI
deployment for some of the largest ISPs worldwide.
Quantifying upward dependencies. We utilize our mapping
from RCs and ROAs to quantify upward dependencies. Fig-
ure 16 depicts the upward dependencies. See Appendix B
for a detailed exposition of our measurement methodology.
We ﬁnd that about 20% of the preﬁxes are upward-dependent
on another organization. In fact, when looking at the portion
of the IP address space (the green bars in Figure 16), we
ﬁnd that these preﬁxes hold less than 10% of the whole IP

address space, probably since organizations with large preﬁxes
typically received their preﬁxes directly from the RIRs and so
have no upward dependencies. Similar measurements focusing
only on the preﬁxes advertised in BGP exhibit the same trends.
We also ﬁnd that the number of preﬁxes with no upward
dependency, i.e., preﬁxes that may be covered by a certiﬁcate
but their owners refrain from doing so, is very high as shown
in the blue ‘no dep.’ bar in Figure 16.
Quantifying downward dependencies. As explained above,
downward dependencies arise when to issue a ROA for its
IP preﬁx an organization must wait for other organizations
advertising a subpreﬁx of that preﬁx to issue ROAs ﬁrst.
We next quantify downward-dependencies (see detailed de-
scription of our measurement methodology in Appendix B).
Figure 17 describes our results: about 90% of the IP preﬁxes
not protected by ROAs are not downward-dependent.
Unfortunately,
the
that
relatively few preﬁxes
are
downward-dependent constitute a large portion of the IP-
address space (compare blue and green bars for those with
more than 100 dependencies in Figure 17) and belong to
some of the largest ISPs worldwide (Orange and Level 3
in Figures 11 and 15 are but a few examples). Figure 18
illustrates this problem, observe the sharp curve showing that
few organizations have most of the downward dependencies.
This is no surprise as the vast majority of ASes are smaller
organizations (that do not sell/lease IP address blocks to
other organizations), whereas large ISPs own large IP address
blocks and suballocate IP addresses to customers. We present
a solution to downward dependencies in Section VII.
VII. DRIVING RPKI FORWARD
We present below several concrete proposals for addressing
the concerns pertaining to RPKI and ROV deployment dis-
cussed in the previous sections. We ﬁrst brieﬂy present three
high-level directions and then dive into the details.
Targeting the large ISPs. Our results in Section IV establish
that ROV adoption by the largest ISPs can lead to signiﬁcant
improvements in global security. Thus, concentrating efforts on
the top ISPs can yield signiﬁcant incentives for issuing ROAs,
hopefully breaking the vicious circular dependency between
the non-issuing of ROAs and the non-enforcement of ROV.
Improving RPKI’s reliability and integrity. As shown in
Section VI-A, relatively few organizations are responsible for
10

the majority of badly issued ROAs. Thus,
the number of
BGP advertisements incorrectly categorized as invalid due
to human error can be signiﬁcantly decreased via focused
effort. To alert network operators about badly issued ROAs
and inform them about their organization-speciﬁc obstacles to
RPKI deployment, we present ROAlert. We argue that ROAlert,
if adopted by the relevant entities (e.g., the RIRs), could aid
in building trust in RPKI and boosting its adoption.
Eliminating downward dependencies with wildcard ROAs.
We present a new kind of ROAs, compatible with today’s for-
mat, which eliminates downward dependencies. As explained
in Section VI-B, this form of inter-organization dependencies
pertains to a signiﬁcant portion of IP addresses and to some
of the world’s largest ISPs.
A. ROAlert
As shown in Figure 12, one of the biggest obstacles to
performing ROV is the signiﬁcant number of bad ROAs. To
mitigate this problem we developed ROAlert, an automated
system that detects bad ROAs and alerts the corresponding
network administrators (through emails and web interface).

TABLE I: Examples of networks and issues raised in the paper
Online, proactive notiﬁcation. ROAlert periodically retrieves
ROAs from RPKI’s publication points and then compares them
against the BGP advertisements retrieved from Route Views
using CAIDA’s BGPStream architecture [5] (every 5 minutes)
so as to identify and classify bad ROAs (both invalidating BGP
advertisements and “loose”). ROAlert uses the RIRs’ Whois
databases to alert the network administrator (at most once a
month for the same violation). Figure 19 illustrates ROAlert’s
design.
Web interface, ROAlert.org. ROAlert also provides a web
interface that allows network operators to check whether their
network is (correctly) protected by ROAs. In the event that
the network is not properly protected, ROAlert explains the
causes for this situation (be it loose ROAs, inter-organization
dependencies, etc.). We encourage the reader to enter the
ROAlert website to ﬁnd out whether her/his IP address is
protected by RPKI and also to learn more details about the
networks mentioned in this paper (Table I) and other networks.
Differences from existing systems. ROAlert is not the ﬁrst
system that compares BGP advertisements and ROAs to detect
errors. In particular, RIPE allows network administrators issu-
ing a ROA to check how that ROA would effect the preﬁxes
advertised through BGP [20], [46]. However, in contrast to
existing systems, ROAlert is not an opt-in service. This is
particularly important when an IP preﬁx of one organization
becomes invalid due to a ROA issued by another organization
(like in the example in Figure 11). In this scenario, the victim
may not even be aware of that ROA issuance or may not fully
comprehend the intricacies of RPKI. Furthermore, ROAlert
is constantly running (whereas [20], [46], for instance,
is
only active when registering a new ROA). Hence, if BGP
announcements change, and “good” ROAs become “bad”,
alerts are issued in real time. ROAlert also identiﬁes loose
ROAs, which are not detected by other systems (since such
ROAs are valid according to RPKI). Lastly, ROAlert notiﬁes
both offenders and victims with concrete suggestions as to how
to ﬁx a given issue.
Importantly, beyond error-detection, ROAlert also serves
another important purpose: identifying organization-speciﬁc
challenges to deployment. To accomplish this, ROAlert relies
11
on careful data analysis of multiple datasets (e.g., to map
RCs, ROAs, and IP preﬁxes to organizations, as explained
in Appendix B). Through such data analyses ROAlert can,
for instance, inform a network operator interested in issuing a
ROA which organizations its network is upward- or downward-
dependent on.
Feedback from network operators. We have received feed-
back and engaged in discussions with 52 of the network
administrators who received our alerts. Of these responders, 40
reported ﬁxing the problem. Five administrators who received
notiﬁcation that another organization had caused their preﬁx
to become invalid reported that they had subsequently engaged
with the offenders. The rest of the responses mostly explained
problematic scenarios that they have difﬁculty addressing, such
as BGP advertisements sent to peering networks, which were
supposed to only be used by these internally, but were in fact
“leaked” onwards. Two responses indicated that the preﬁx was,
in fact, hijacked (probably due to conﬁguration errors at the
offending AS).
Measurements. We have sent notiﬁcations to a total of 552
victims and offenders through ROAlert over the course of six
months, yet only 168 emails did not “bounce” (see discussion
of limitations below). We checked whether one month after
notiﬁcation the problem was ﬁxed by re-examining the ROAs
and BGP route-advertisements via ROAlert. The results of
these follow-up checks reveal that ROAlert notiﬁcations, when
reaching the network operator’s mailbox, are effective. Over
42% of “bad ROA” alerts resulted in ﬁxing the problematic
ROA one month later, this is contrasted with about 15% of
ROAs ﬁxed involving operators that ROAlert could not contact.
