### Encouraging News on RPKI Deployment

Encouraging news: although hundreds of organizations are responsible for invalid IP prefixes, a small number of them cause the majority of these errors. Specifically, only 20 organizations are responsible for issuing the ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations) that cause 50% of the errors, as shown in Figure 14. This finding is significant for driving RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) deployment, which we discuss in Section VII.

### Inter-Organization Dependencies

Another potential reason for the low number of ROAs in RPKI is inter-organization dependencies. These dependencies arise when an organization must wait for other organizations to take action before it can issue an RC (Resource Certificate) and/or ROA for a prefix. There are two types of such dependencies: upward and downward.

#### Upward Dependency
The upward dependency pertains to issuing RCs. For a prefix \( p \), the RC must be signed by an entity already in possession of a valid RC for a super-prefix containing \( p \). Figure 15 illustrates the hierarchical structure of RPKI and the inter-organizational upward dependencies. For example, Level 3 Communications, one of the largest ISPs worldwide, was allocated its IP addresses directly from ARIN, the RIR (Regional Internet Registry) for North America, but did not issue an RC. Consequently, over 500 other organizations, including Twitter, LinkedIn, and eBay, are unable to obtain RCs and issue ROAs to protect their thousands of prefixes, as illustrated in Figure 15.

#### Downward Dependency
The downward dependency pertains to issuing ROAs. If a prefix \( p \) originates from AS \( a \), but has a subprefix \( \bar{p} \) that originates from a different AS \( b \) (belonging to a different organization), then publishing a ROA specifying \( a \) as the origin AS of \( p \) before a ROA specifying \( b \) as the origin AS of \( \bar{p} \) would invalidate BGP advertisements of \( \bar{p} \). An example of this is shown in Figure 11 with Orange and its customers.

### Quantifying Dependencies

We next investigate the extent to which upward and downward dependencies explain the slow adoption of RPKI. Our results show that while there are not many inter-organizational dependencies, downward dependencies pose obstacles to RPKI deployment for some of the largest ISPs worldwide.

#### Upward Dependencies
Using our mapping from RCs and ROAs, we quantify upward dependencies. Figure 16 depicts the upward dependencies. See Appendix B for a detailed exposition of our measurement methodology. We find that about 20% of the prefixes are upward-dependent on another organization. However, these prefixes hold less than 10% of the whole IP address space, likely because organizations with large prefixes typically received their prefixes directly from the RIRs and thus have no upward dependencies. Similar measurements focusing only on the prefixes advertised in BGP exhibit the same trends. The number of prefixes with no upward dependency, i.e., prefixes that may be covered by a certificate but whose owners refrain from doing so, is very high, as shown in the blue 'no dep.' bar in Figure 16.

#### Downward Dependencies
Downward dependencies arise when an organization must wait for other organizations advertising a subprefix of its prefix to issue ROAs first. We quantify downward dependencies (see detailed description of our measurement methodology in Appendix B). Figure 17 describes our results: about 90% of the IP prefixes not protected by ROAs are not downward-dependent. Unfortunately, the relatively few prefixes that are downward-dependent constitute a large portion of the IP address space (compare blue and green bars for those with more than 100 dependencies in Figure 17) and belong to some of the largest ISPs worldwide (e.g., Orange and Level 3 in Figures 11 and 15). Figure 18 illustrates this problem, showing that a few organizations have most of the downward dependencies. This is expected, as the vast majority of ASes are smaller organizations (that do not sell/lease IP address blocks to other organizations), whereas large ISPs own large IP address blocks and suballocate IP addresses to customers. We present a solution to downward dependencies in Section VII.

### Driving RPKI Forward

We present several concrete proposals for addressing the concerns related to RPKI and ROV (Route Origin Validation) deployment discussed in the previous sections. We first briefly present three high-level directions and then delve into the details.

#### Targeting Large ISPs
Our results in Section IV establish that ROV adoption by the largest ISPs can lead to significant improvements in global security. Thus, concentrating efforts on the top ISPs can yield significant incentives for issuing ROAs, hopefully breaking the vicious circular dependency between the non-issuing of ROAs and the non-enforcement of ROV.

#### Improving RPKI’s Reliability and Integrity
As shown in Section VI-A, relatively few organizations are responsible for the majority of badly issued ROAs. Thus, the number of BGP advertisements incorrectly categorized as invalid due to human error can be significantly decreased via focused effort. To alert network operators about badly issued ROAs and inform them about their organization-specific obstacles to RPKI deployment, we present ROAlert. We argue that ROAlert, if adopted by the relevant entities (e.g., the RIRs), could aid in building trust in RPKI and boosting its adoption.

#### Eliminating Downward Dependencies with Wildcard ROAs
We present a new kind of ROAs, compatible with today’s format, which eliminates downward dependencies. As explained in Section VI-B, this form of inter-organization dependencies pertains to a significant portion of IP addresses and to some of the world’s largest ISPs.

### ROAlert System

ROAlert is an automated system that detects bad ROAs and alerts the corresponding network administrators (through emails and a web interface). Figure 12 shows that one of the biggest obstacles to performing ROV is the significant number of bad ROAs. To mitigate this problem, we developed ROAlert, which periodically retrieves ROAs from RPKI’s publication points and compares them against BGP advertisements retrieved from Route Views using CAIDA’s BGPStream architecture (every 5 minutes) to identify and classify bad ROAs. ROAlert uses the RIRs’ Whois databases to alert the network administrator (at most once a month for the same violation). Figure 19 illustrates ROAlert’s design.

#### Web Interface
ROAlert also provides a web interface at ROAlert.org, allowing network operators to check whether their network is (correctly) protected by ROAs. In the event that the network is not properly protected, ROAlert explains the causes for this situation (e.g., loose ROAs, inter-organization dependencies, etc.). We encourage readers to visit the ROAlert website to find out whether their IP address is protected by RPKI and to learn more details about the networks mentioned in this paper (Table I) and other networks.

#### Differences from Existing Systems
ROAlert is not the first system that compares BGP advertisements and ROAs to detect errors. RIPE, for example, allows network administrators issuing a ROA to check how that ROA would affect the prefixes advertised through BGP [20], [46]. However, in contrast to existing systems, ROAlert is not an opt-in service. This is particularly important when an IP prefix of one organization becomes invalid due to a ROA issued by another organization (as in the example in Figure 11). In such scenarios, the victim may not even be aware of the ROA issuance or may not fully comprehend the intricacies of RPKI. Furthermore, ROAlert is constantly running, whereas [20], [46] are only active when registering a new ROA. Hence, if BGP announcements change and “good” ROAs become “bad,” alerts are issued in real time. ROAlert also identifies loose ROAs, which are not detected by other systems (since such ROAs are valid according to RPKI). Lastly, ROAlert notifies both offenders and victims with concrete suggestions on how to fix a given issue.

#### Identifying Organization-Specific Challenges
Beyond error-detection, ROAlert serves another important purpose: identifying organization-specific challenges to deployment. To accomplish this, ROAlert relies on careful data analysis of multiple datasets (e.g., to map RCs, ROAs, and IP prefixes to organizations, as explained in Appendix B). Through such data analyses, ROAlert can, for instance, inform a network operator interested in issuing a ROA which organizations its network is upward- or downward-dependent on.

#### Feedback from Network Operators
We have received feedback and engaged in discussions with 52 network administrators who received our alerts. Of these responders, 40 reported fixing the problem. Five administrators who were notified that another organization had caused their prefix to become invalid reported that they had subsequently engaged with the offenders. The rest of the responses mostly explained problematic scenarios that they have difficulty addressing, such as BGP advertisements sent to peering networks, which were supposed to be used internally but were in fact "leaked" onwards. Two responses indicated that the prefix was, in fact, hijacked (probably due to configuration errors at the offending AS).

#### Measurements
We have sent notifications to a total of 552 victims and offenders through ROAlert over the course of six months, but only 168 emails did not “bounce.” We checked whether one month after notification the problem was fixed by re-examining the ROAs and BGP route-advertisements via ROAlert. The results of these follow-up checks reveal that ROAlert notifications, when reaching the network operator’s mailbox, are effective. Over 42% of “bad ROA” alerts resulted in fixing the problematic ROA one month later, compared to about 15% of ROAs fixed involving operators that ROAlert could not contact.
