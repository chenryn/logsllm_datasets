Parameters
Parameter
Description
-o rsize=
Sets the size in kilobytes of the read buffer. Acceptable values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32; the default is 32 KB.
-o wsize=
Sets the size in kilobytes of the write buffer. Acceptable values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32; the default is 32 KB.
-o timeout=
Sets the time-out value in seconds for a remote procedure call (RPC). Acceptable values are 0.8, 0.9, and any integer in the range 1-60; the default is 0.8.
-o retry=
Sets the number of retries for a soft mount. Acceptable values are integers in the range 1-10; the default is 1.
-o mtype={soft|hard}
Sets the mount type for your NFS share. By default, Windows uses a soft mount. Soft mounts time out more easily when there are connection issues; however, to reduce I/O disruption during NFS server reboots, we recommend using a hard mount.
-o anon
Mounts as an anonymous user.
-o nolock
Disables locking (default is enabled).
-o casesensitive
Forces file lookups on the server to be case sensitive.
-o fileaccess=
Specifies the default permission mode of new files created on the NFS share. Specify mode as a three-digit number in the form ogw, where o, g, and w are each a digit representing the access granted the file's owner, group, and the world, respectively. The digits must be in the range 0-7, including:0: No access1: x (execute access)2: w (write access)3: wx (write and execute access)4: r (read access)5: rx (read and execute access)6: rw (read and write access)7: rwx (read, write, and execute access)
-o lang={euc-jp|euc-tw|euc-kr|shift-jis|Big5|Ksc5601|Gb2312-80|Ansi)
Specifies the language encoding to configure on an NFS share. You can use only one language on the share. This value can include any of the following values:euc-jp: Japaneseeuc-tw: Chineseeuc-kr: Koreanshift-jis: JapaneseBig5: ChineseKsc5601: KoreanGb2312-80: Simplified ChineseAnsi: ANSI-encoded
-u:
Specifies the user name to use for mounting the share. If username isn't preceded by a backslash ( \ ), it's treated as a UNIX user name.
-p:
The password to use for mounting the share. If you use an asterisk (*), you'll be prompted for the password.
Specifies the name of the NFS server.
