Original title: _**"Cosine" affinity type in FeatureAgglomeration somehow
casue memory overflow in a particular dataset**_
#### Description
Please carefully test the codes below! Using "cosine" affinity type in
FeatureAgglomeration, the codes will cause memory overflow with a particular
dataset (Download here). It is all right with other affinity types. And this
issue cannot be reproduced using simulation data (like using
make_classification in sci-kit learn). Not sure why it happened.
#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
    from sklearn.cluster import FeatureAgglomeration
    import numpy as np
    import time
    train_data = np.genfromtxt('fold_2_trainFeatVec.csv', delimiter=',')
    train_labels= np.genfromtxt('fold_2_trainLabels.csv', delimiter=',')
    fa = FeatureAgglomeration(affinity="cosine", linkage="average") # no matter linage ="average" or "complete"
    time_start= time.time()
    fa.fit(train_data, train_labels) # memory keeps increasing here
    time_end = time.time()
    print('Time usage:',time_end-time_start)
