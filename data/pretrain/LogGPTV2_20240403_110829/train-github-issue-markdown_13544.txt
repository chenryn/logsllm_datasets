Let say we have this code:
    @Component({
        selector:'my-app',
        template:`
        Chess
    `
    })
    class Chess {}
It doesn't work and it is right. Attribute in router-outlet directive is like
a 'const' modifier in typescript. You can set it only manually in a template.  
But what if I develop application and set routes and outlets dynamically. How
expensive it will be to allow router-outlet directive to be dynamic?
