User: Please explain the concepts of service fault tolerance and service degradation, and provide corresponding solutions.
Assistant: Service fault tolerance and service degradation are two approaches to achieve high availability in distributed systems. Service fault tolerance: When there is a dependency between services, if a service fails, it will affect the stability of the entire system. Therefore, the purpose of service fault tolerance is to minimize the impact of failures. Improve the fault tolerance of the system through the deployment of multiple nodes, load balancing, one node backup, and grayscale upgrades. Service degradation: When the system experiences abnormal load peaks or insufficient resources, the system may experience intermittent interruptions, delays, or even downtime. In order to avoid the collapse of the entire system, service degradation can be implemented. Separate the important functions of the system from the secondary functions, restrict the secondary functions, and give priority to ensuring the availability of the core business. For example, when the server load is high, some non-core function services can be suspended, and the results of these requests can be returned directly instead of timeout or failure. Solution: 1. Service fault-tolerant solution: (1) Multi-node deployment: through multi-node deployment, the service is deployed on multiple nodes. When a node fails, other nodes can take over the service to ensure the availability of the system. (2) Load balancing: Through load balancing, requests are distributed to different nodes, system resources are used reasonably, and the influence of single point of failure is avoided. (3) One node is backup: Through the one node is backup scheme, the data of multiple nodes is synchronized. When the master node goes down, the backup node can take over the service in time. 2. Service downgrading scheme: (1) Flow limiting and downgrading: By limiting the request flow of the system or the number of concurrent requests processed at the same time, avoid high load on the service. (2) Fuse downgrade: When the service is abnormal or timed out, you can use the fuse to suspend the service and avoid continuous attempts to access and increase the load on the system. (3) Responsive downgrade: Improve user experience and usability by still returning a response to prompt service downgrade instead of a failure response.
