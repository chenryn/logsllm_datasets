## Abstract
While many cloud storage systems allow users to protect their data through encryption, few support collaborative editing on that data. A significant challenge in enabling such collaboration is the need to enforce cryptographic access control policies securely and efficiently. In this paper, we introduce IBBE-SGX, a new cryptographic access control extension that is efficient in terms of computation and storage, even for large and dynamic workloads of membership operations, while offering zero-knowledge guarantees.

IBBE-SGX builds upon Identity-Based Broadcasting Encryption (IBBE). We address IBBE's impracticality for cloud deployments by leveraging Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to reduce computational complexity. Additionally, we propose a group partitioning mechanism to ensure that the computational cost of membership updates is bound to a fixed constant partition size rather than the size of the entire group. Our implementation and evaluation show that IBBE-SGX performs membership changes 1.2 orders of magnitude faster than the traditional Hybrid Encryption (HE) approach, with group metadata that are 6 orders of magnitude smaller than HE, while still providing zero-knowledge guarantees.

## 1. Introduction
Cloud storage services like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure have seen rapid adoption in recent years [1]. However, these services often lack trustworthiness and confidentiality guarantees for end users. Threats can originate from malicious adversaries, insider threats, or government surveillance. To mitigate these issues, many approaches rely on client-side encryption to secure data before it reaches the cloud provider [2].

To enable collaborative operations on encrypted data, cryptographic access control policies must be enforced. In an untrusted cloud storage context, such policies should minimize traffic overhead, be computationally efficient, and provide zero-knowledge guarantees. Furthermore, existing user credentials should suffice for membership operations, avoiding complex trust establishment protocols.

Several cryptographic constructions have been proposed for access control, including Hybrid Encryption (HE), which combines symmetric and public-key cryptography [4], and pairing-based schemes like Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) [5], Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) [6], and Identity-Based Broadcasting Encryption (IBBE) [7]. However, these schemes suffer from performance issues and do not guarantee zero-knowledge.

In this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic access control scheme that is both computationally and storage-efficient for dynamic and large sets of membership operations, while providing zero-knowledge guarantees. Zero knowledge is achieved by executing cryptographic access control membership operations in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Our scheme is based on IBBE, known for its flexibility in producing small, constant policy sizes but with high computational costs. By executing IBBE within the TEE, we can use a master secret key, reducing computational complexity. We also propose a group partitioning mechanism to limit the computational cost for users to a fixed constant partition size.

We implemented our scheme using Intel SGX as the TEE and deployed it on a commercially available public cloud storage. Our evaluation shows that our scheme requires minimal resources, outperforms HE, and provides zero-knowledge guarantees.

### Contributions
- **New Approach to IBBE:** We leverage Intel SGX to lower the computational complexity of a well-studied IBBE scheme, requiring TEE support only for a minimal set of administrators.
- **Partitioning Scheme:** We propose a novel partitioning scheme that reduces the time required by users to process access control changes.
- **Implementation and Evaluation:** We fully implemented and evaluated our system, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Our solution can be applied to various scenarios, such as peer-to-peer networks or pay-per-view TV, beyond cloud storage.

## 2. Model
We consider groups of users performing collaborative editing on cryptographically protected data stored on untrusted cloud storage systems. The data is protected using a block cipher encryption algorithm like AES, with a symmetric group key \( gk \). Our goal is to design a system for group access control, where \( gk \) is cryptographically protected and derivable only by group members. Given the potential for frequent member additions and revocations, we investigate the implications of numerous membership changes.

### Actors
- **Administrators:** Perform all group membership operations, including creating groups, adding, or revoking members. They are honest-but-curious, meaning they correctly serve requests but may try to discover \( gk \).
- **Users:** Listen for group membership changes and derive the new \( gk \) when it changes. Users are considered trusted.

### Cloud Storage
The cloud storage stores group definitions (metadata), member lists, and actual group data. It acts as a broadcasting interface for group access control changes. Administrators communicate with the cloud during membership operations to notify users of updates. The cloud storage is also honest-but-curious and may collude with curious administrators or revoked users.

### Scale
We target a solution for very large-scale groups, with administrators performing membership changes for multiple groups simultaneously. Authenticity is ensured only for administrator identities, and the focus is on confidentiality rather than hiding member identities or operation types.

## 3. Background
Our access control extension leverages Intel SGX, Hybrid Encryption, and Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption. This section provides an overview of these technologies and the challenges they address.

### Intel SGX
Intel SGX is an instruction set extension available on modern x86 CPUs, designed to shield code execution and data from unauthorized access. It creates a trusted execution environment (TEE) that isolates sensitive computations and data from the rest of the system.

### Hybrid Encryption
Hybrid Encryption (HE) combines symmetric and public-key cryptography. Symmetric encryption is used for the actual data, while public-key cryptography is used to encrypt the symmetric key. This approach balances security and efficiency but can be computationally expensive for dynamic access control.

### Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption
Identity-Based Broadcasting Encryption (IBBE) allows a sender to broadcast encrypted messages to a group of receivers, each identified by a unique identity. IBBE is flexible and produces small, constant policy sizes but has high computational costs, making it impractical for large-scale deployments.

## 4. Construction
### Leveraging SGX
By executing IBBE within the TEE provided by Intel SGX, we can use a master secret key, significantly reducing computational complexity. The TEE ensures that the secret key remains within the trusted computing boundary, providing zero-knowledge guarantees.

### Group Partitioning
To further reduce computational costs, we propose a group partitioning mechanism. This ensures that the computational cost for users to process membership changes is bound to a fixed constant partition size rather than the size of the entire group.

## 5. Design and Implementation
We implemented our access control system using Intel SGX and deployed it on a commercial public cloud storage. Our system is designed to handle large-scale, dynamic membership operations efficiently while maintaining zero-knowledge guarantees.

## 6. Evaluation
We conducted extensive evaluations, including micro- and macro-benchmarks, to compare our system with state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show that IBBE-SGX outperforms traditional methods in terms of computational efficiency and resource usage, while providing strong security guarantees.

## 7. Related Work
We review related work in the fields of cryptography, access control systems, and SGX, highlighting the unique contributions of our approach.

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, IBBE-SGX offers a novel and efficient solution for cryptographic group access control in untrusted cloud environments. Future work will explore additional optimizations and applications in other domains, such as peer-to-peer networks and pay-per-view TV.
