Hi, I've been using Electron for a few months, but autoupdate started
returning an error after `0.33.4`. I've been using the same endpoint hosted by
Github.
## Error message
    2015-11-18 22:31:12.249 Electron[71075:3518387] NSURLSession/NSURLConnection 
    HTTP load failed (kCFStreamErrorDomainSSL, -9802)
    [DeskDrive] Uncaught exception: Error: An SSL error has occurred and a secure
    connection to the server cannot be made.: (null) Error: An SSL error has occurred
    and a secure connection to the server cannot be made.: (null)
        at Error (native)
    ^C
( _DeskDrive_ is the name of the app I'm working on.)
## Repro Code
    const autoUpdater = require('auto-updater');
    autoUpdater.setFeedURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylang/DeskDrive-releases/master/auto_updater.json');
    autoUpdater.checkForUpdates();
**Note:** App must be built _and signed_ for `autoUpdater` to show this error.
## Versions
  * Was working in 0.33.4, but has been failing in every build up to 0.35
  * Testing in OS X 11.1 (El Capitan)
  * Tested with and without firewall/proxy/etc.
