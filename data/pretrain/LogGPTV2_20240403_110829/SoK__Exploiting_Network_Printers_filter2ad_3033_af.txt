It appears that the text you provided contains a mix of non-printable characters, Unicode control characters, and other symbols that do not form coherent sentences. I will attempt to reconstruct and optimize the content based on the readable parts. Here is the optimized version:

### 7.3. Print Job Manipulation

#### Content Overlay
To implement the attack described in Section 5.3, we redefined the `showpage` operator, which is present in every PostScript document to print the current page. By hooking into this operator, we can execute our own code and then call the original version of the operator. This allows us to overlay all pages to be printed with a custom document. This attack was applicable to 14 devices.

#### Content Replacement
Replacing text in PostScript files is challenging because strings can be dynamically built by the PostScript program itself. Simple parsing and replacing within the document source code is not a general solution. We used the approach by Nevill-Manning et al. [44] and redefined the `show` operator, which is used to paint current strings. This simple approach is most effective for text documents created, for example, with LaTeX.

### 7.4. Information Disclosure

In this section, we present different attacks leading to information disclosure, such as revealing content stored in memory, files on the file system, or print jobs.

#### Memory Access
We were unable to reproduce memory dumping using PostScript as described in Section 5.4, as we did not have access to Xerox devices. However, our evaluation showed that Brother MFC-9120CN, Brother DCP-9045CDN, and Konica bizhub 20p were vulnerable to arbitrary NVRAM access using PJL. Listing 13 shows an example attack vector, where `X` is an integer referring to the accessed memory address. Our prototype implementation increments this value to dump the NVRAM.

**Listing 13: Read byte at location X.**
```plaintext
@PJL RNVRAM ADDRESS = X
```

This critical attack leads to the disclosure of user PINs and passwords for the embedded web server, POP3, SMTP, FTP, and Active Directory profiles.

#### File System Access
To evaluate PostScript and PJL implementations for their ability to access the file system, we implemented this functionality in PRET according to the standards [8], [46].

Accessing files with PostScript was supported by various devices in our test printer pool but was sandboxed to a specific directory, limiting the attacker's actions to mostly harmless ones like font modification. Only the HP LaserJet 4200N was prone to path traversal, allowing access to the entire file system. This issue affects almost 40 other HP devices and was discussed in [5]. An example of PostScript file system access on the HP LaserJet 4200N is given in Listing 14.

**Listing 14: Read password file with PostScript.**
```plaintext
%!
read { byte exch 0 exch put
infile
(% stdout )
{ infile
file byte write string }
/ byte
/ infile
{
exit } if else
( ../../../etc/passwd )
( r )
file def
( 0 ) def }}
(w)
closefile
} loop
```

The HP developers attempted to fix this issue in the firmware for the HP LaserJet 4250N. However, we could bypass this protection with a new attack using `%*%` special characters as disk prefix and `.././` instead of `../` for path traversal. This allowed us to access the entire file system even for the latest firmware version. The impact is significant; passwords for the embedded web server can be found in `/dev/rdsk_jdi_cfg0`, while the RAM is available for reading and writing at `/dev/dsk_ram0`.

OKI MC342dn allowed us to execute one level of path traversal, where a directory called `hidden/` contained stored fax numbers, email contacts, local users' PINs, and the SNMP community string. More interestingly, this MFP can be integrated into a network using features like Email-to-Print or Scan-to-FTP. An attacker can find in the `hidden/` directory passwords for LDAP, POP3, SMTP, outbound HTTP proxy, FTP, SMB, Webdav, as well as the IPsec pre-shared keys. This is a good example of how an attacker can escalate their way into a company’s network, using the printer device as a starting point.

Four tested devices allowed us to access the file system with PJL commands. HP LaserJet 4200N and HP LaserJet 4250N were prone to path traversal attacks, which are well known for both devices and have been discussed in [3]. An example of PJL file system access on the HP LaserJet 4200N is given in Listing 15.

**Listing 15: Read password file with PJL.**
```plaintext
@PJL FSQUERY NAME = "0:\..\..\etc\passwd"
@PJL FSUPLOAD NAME = "0:\..\..\etc\passwd" OFFSET=0 SIZE=23
```

### 8. Countermeasures

There is no single solution to counter all design-immanent flaws in printers. However, there are various short- and long-term recommendations, best practices, and workarounds to mitigate the risks until they are fixed by printer manufacturers. Network administrators should never leave their printers accessible from the Internet and disable raw port 9100/tcp printing if not required. While this does not prevent all the presented attacks, it complicates them and mitigates the attacker’s ability to leak data. A more secure approach is to completely sandbox all printing devices into a separate VLAN, only accessible by a hardened print server as proposed by Costin [18] and shown in Figure 9. If the printer supports authentication, it should be configured to accept print jobs from authorized personnel only.
