### Introduction
For those of us in the security field, the rise of Web 2.0 has been both fascinating and concerning. Promiscuous sharing of information, client-side JavaScript, blogging, micro-blogging, and social networks have created a platform where anyone can create content, connect, and share. This contrasts sharply with the principles we advocate in information security: "Validate all user input, authenticate and tokenize everything, sanitize all output, audit rigorously, limit functionality, and trust no one."

From a security perspective, giving users an open platform to create and share content and applications seems like a recipe for disaster. Yet, even the most paranoid among us, such as attendees and speakers at BlackHat and DefCon, are being drawn into these platforms. These organizations, whose members often use pseudonyms and have faced legal and travel issues, are now inviting participants to join LinkedIn groups and micro-blog on Twitter.

The appeal of social networks lies in their ability to bring a human touch to digital interactions. The thrill of making a new connection or receiving a response evokes the same excitement as finding a new bulletin board system (BBS) back in the day. Even the most security-conscious individuals are being drawn in, and it’s clear that social networks are here to stay. So, how bad is it really? How far behind the curve are we in terms of safety versus features?

### Vivisecting The Social Net Model
To understand how social networks can be attacked, we need to break down their components. Most social networking sites share basic functionalities, ranging from simple platforms like Twitter to more complex ones like Facebook and MySpace.

#### Connections, Entities
An entity in a social network is anything that can form connections with other entities, such as bots, groups, applications, or humans. A connection implies a degree of trust, and each entity in a connection list extends this trust transitively. Connections and links between entities form the backbone of social networks, and many attack vectors exploit these relationships.

#### Personae and Simulacra
Social networks encourage users to present idealized versions of themselves. Users use flattering photos and bombastic resumes to build a better-than-real-life persona. Attackers can exploit this by appealing to vanity or providing ways to further enhance the persona.

#### Culture of Trust
Social networks are built on a foundation of trust. Unlike other social media, there is little democracy, and users have limited means to police bad actors. The culture of trust and sharing makes social networks attractive targets for attackers.

#### Framework and Platform
Social network frameworks facilitate connections and rapport between users. Providers constantly add new features to match potential connections, send messages, and share media, creating more opportunities for targeted advertising. Open APIs like OpenSocial allow for cross-site functionality, increasing shared exposure and potential vulnerabilities.

### Attacking Social Networks
Social networks are prime targets due to their large user base. The trusting nature of these environments makes it easier for attackers to succeed. Users are less likely to think they would be targeted and may perceive browser-based software as less dangerous than installed software, making them more likely to download and install social applications.

#### Attacking Social Network Functionality
Attackers have several methods at their disposal when targeting social networks. The user-generated content model introduces many potential vulnerabilities. Stricter restrictions can make the network less appealing, but too few restrictions increase vulnerability.
