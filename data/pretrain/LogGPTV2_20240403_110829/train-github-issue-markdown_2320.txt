### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
I'm using `npm@8.5.2` and making use of the workspaces feature, my
(simplified) project's structure is the following:
    my_project
    |_ packages
       |_ commons
       |_ logger
       |_ metrics
       |_ tracing
    package.json 
In my `package.json` file I have the following config:
    "workspaces": [
        "packages/*"
     ]
The project uses TypeScript and the packages `logger`, `metrics`, `tracing`
all depend on `commons`.
When I run `npm ci` in my CI/CD environment (GitHub Actions) after installing
the dependencies npm tries to build (`tsc`) the packages but appear to do so
in parallel and so the build of all the dependant packages fails because it's
being done before `commons` is ready.
### Expected Behavior
Npm to understand that some packages of the workspace are dependant on others
and build accordingly.
Alternatively to allow me to specify that I want to use a remote (i.e. not
linked) version of the package even though the version number is the same as
the local one.
### Steps To Reproduce
Read above, also you can see the error (with `logLevel == silly`) here
