Question: "Consider the following pseudo x86 assembly code sequence:

mov eax, 5
push eax
pop ebx

After the execution of this code sequence, what statements are correct regarding the stack and the registers?"
 "A": "The value 5 is removed from the stack and the esp register is incremented."
 "B": "The esp register points to the bottom of the stack, and the value below esp is undefined."
 "C": "The value 5 is still accessible in the stack because it is not wiped from memory after the pop instruction."
 "D": "The value in the ebx register is undefined because the pop instruction does not copy values into registers."
Answer: AB
