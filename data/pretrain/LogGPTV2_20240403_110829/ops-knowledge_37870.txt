Assistant: The process of deploying a web application on a cloud server includes the following steps: 1. Apply for an EC2 instance: Open the management console provided by the cloud service provider, select the option to create a virtual server instance (EC2), select the instance type and configuration, and set security group rules and SSH keys and other information, and finally start the instance. 2. Install the web server: log in to the operating system of the EC2 instance, use the corresponding command or package manager to install the required web server software, such as Nginx or Apache, and then perform related settings and configurations (such as binding domain name, SSL certificate, etc.) to ensure that the server operates correctly. 3. Upload the application: upload the locally developed web application to the deployed server through FTP or SCP to ensure that the program can work normally and respond to user requests. 4. Configuration service: Perform server configuration according to specific application requirements, such as setting database connections, timing tasks, log records, etc., to ensure that web applications run stably on the server. 5. Start the service: After completing the above steps, start the Web server and Web application to provide services to users. At the same time, error logging and monitoring are carried out to solve potential problems in time to ensure the stability and security of web applications.
