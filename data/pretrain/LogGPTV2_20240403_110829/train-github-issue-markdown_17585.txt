I've had the zones reset to their default almost every time I upgrade the
application to a new version.  
More annoyingly, on the latest version (v0.23.0) they also get reset every
reboot.  
Please make sure these settings survive a reboot as well as an application
upgrade.
Even better, store them per monitor (some unique ID) so that the settings are
remembered for different monitors. For instance when using a laptop which is
sometimes connected to monitor A (at home) and sometimes to monitor B (at
work). So you can set the zones up differently for each monitor.
Please let me know if there is any additional information needed to
troubleshoot this issue.
P.S. I'm running Win10 (v2004, build 19041.508) on a desktop with 2 monitors
permanently connected.
