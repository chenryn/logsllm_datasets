User: How to check if application in Tornado listen some url ?
I need to listen lot off urls, for new game I create new and add programmatically handler for that url, but I first need to check. How to check if Tornado already listen url?
Assistant: I believe you'll need a fine-grained access to the active games, so better keep them in your domain model.
Still, you can examine tornado.web.Application.handlers of your app.
