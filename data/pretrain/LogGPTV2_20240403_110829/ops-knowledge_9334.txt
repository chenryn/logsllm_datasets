### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk details the initialization and setup of a Spark Executor on a Mesos Slave. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the key events:

1. **Signal Handler Registration**:
   - At `17-06-09 20:10:40`, the `executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` registers signal handlers for `TERM`, `HUP`, and `INT`.

2. **Security Configuration**:
   - The `spark.SecurityManager` changes the view and modify ACLs to include `yarn` and `curi`.
   - It confirms that authentication and UI ACLs are disabled, and specifies that `yarn` and `curi` have both view and modify permissions.

3. **Logging Initialization**:
   - At `17-06-09 20:10:41`, the `slf4j.Slf4jLogger` starts.

4. **Remoting Service**:
   - The `Remoting` service starts and listens on the address `akka.tcp://sparkExecutorActorSystem@mesos-slave-07:55904`.
   - The `util.Utils` service successfully starts the `sparkExecutorActorSystem` on port `55904`.

5. **Storage Management**:
   - A local directory is created at `/opt/hdfs/nodemanager/usercache/curi/appcache/application_1485248649253_0147/blockmgr-70293f72-844a-4b39-9ad6-fb0ad7e364e4`.
   - The `storage.MemoryStore` is started with a capacity of 17.7 GB.

6. **Executor Connection and Registration**:
   - At `17-06-09 20:10:42`, the `executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` connects to the driver at `spark://CoarseGrainedScheduler@10.10.34.11:48069`.
   - The executor successfully registers with the driver.
   - The `executor.Executor` starts with ID `5` on the host `mesos-slave-07`.

7. **Block Transfer Service**:
   - The `util.Utils` service starts the `org.apache.spark.network.netty.NettyBlockTransferService` on port `40984`.
   - The `netty.NettyBlockTransferService` server is created on port `40984`.

8. **Block Manager Registration**:
   - The `storage.BlockManagerMaster` attempts to register the `BlockManager`.
   - The `BlockManager` is successfully registered with the `BlockManagerMaster`.

This log provides a detailed sequence of events during the initialization and setup of a Spark Executor, including security configurations, logging, remoting, storage, and block management.
