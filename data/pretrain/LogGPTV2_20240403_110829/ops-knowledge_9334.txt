Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of a Spark Executor on a Mesos Slave. It begins by registering signal handlers for TERM, HUP, and INT. It then sets view and modify access control lists (ACLs) for yarn and curi. The Slf4jLogger is started, followed by the Remoting service. A local directory is created, and the MemoryStore is started with a capacity of 17.7 GB. The Executor then connects to the driver, registers with it, and starts on the host. The NettyBlockTransferService is started on port 40984, and the BlockManager is registered with the BlockManagerMaster.
