ABSTRACT
Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has
been increasingly applied to fabricate highly intellectual prop-
erty (IP) sensitive products. However, the related IP protec-
tion issues in 3D printers are still largely underexplored. On
the other hand, smartphones are equipped with rich onboard
sensors and have been applied to pervasive mobile surveil-
lance in many applications. These facts raise one critical
question:
is it possible that smartphones access the side-
channel signals of 3D printer and then hack the IP infor-
mation? To answer this, we perform an end-to-end study
on exploring smartphone-based side-channel attacks against
3D printers. Speciﬁcally, we formulate the problem of the
IP side-channel attack in 3D printing. Then, we investigate
the possible acoustic and magnetic side-channel attacks us-
ing the smartphone built-in sensors. Moreover, we explore a
magnetic-enhanced side-channel attack model to accurately
deduce the vital directional operations of 3D printer. Ex-
perimental results show that by exploiting the side-channel
signals collected by smartphones, we can successfully re-
construct the physical prints and their G-code with Mean
Tendency Error of 5.87% on regular designs and 9.67% on
complex designs, respectively. Our study demonstrates this
new and practical smartphone-based side channel attack on
compromising IP information during 3D printing.

INTRODUCTION
After decades of development, additive manufacturing (AM),
also known as 3D printing, has been becoming a mainstream
manufacturing process in various industry ﬁelds. Speciﬁ-
cally, it refers to a process by which 3D digital design data
(in the cyber domain) is used to build up a 3D physical
object in layers by depositing material (in the physical do-
main). Compared with the conventional manufacturing tech-
niques, 3D printing has the following advantages: 1) eﬃ-
ciency:
fast and cost-eﬃcient production with less waste
material; 2) creativity: ﬂexible with more complex geome-
tries construction; 3) accessibility: aﬀordable price of 3D

printers and materials. The global value of 3D printing is
estimated to reach over 20.2 billion dollars by 2021 [42].
With the wide expansion of 3D printing and new merging
materials in application ﬁelds, there are increasingly more
highly intellectual-property (IP) sensitive products manu-
factured by 3D printers. Key industries, such as medical
[26, 17], aerospace [15, 28] as well as biomedical sectors [39,
37], contain conﬁdential IP from personal health-care to na-
tional strategic products. Therefore, IP security in the 3D
printing process chain has received increasing attention in
the last two years. Speciﬁcally, 3D printing can be divided
into the cyber domain and the physical domain. In 2014,
Strum et al.
[38] raised the idea of cyber-vulnerability in
3D printing where a malicious software can alter design ﬁles.
Later on, many security technologies such as encryption and
watermark, were adopted to protect IP in the cyber domain
[13, 19]. However, IP protection in the physical domain of
3D printing is still underexplored.
Considering that smartphones are equipped with a rich set
of on-board sensors, we ask one question: is it possible to in-
fer IP information when a smartphone is placed nearby and
record side-channel signals during the 3D printing process?
This question raises a potentially more serious concern on
IP protection issues in 3D printing. Compared with profes-
sional devices, smartphones are more commonly used and
accessible in daily life, and the side-channel attack using a
smartphone can be inconspicuously launched because of its
portability and pervasiveness. This observation motivates
us to investigate the IP leakage potential in side channels of
3D printers using commercial oﬀ-the-shelf smartphones.
In this paper, we perform an end-to-end study on explor-
ing smartphone-based side-channel attacks against 3D print-
ers. We formulate the IP deﬁnition and attack protection
problem in the 3D printing application. These formal def-
initions can systematically evaluate potential attacks and
guide defense models. After that, we analyze the working
mechanism of 3D printers in-depth and reveal the possible
side channels and their relationship to the 3D design infor-
mation. During the printing process, multiple electrome-
chanical parts in 3D printers will emit diverse side-channel
signals according to the G-code instructions, which contain
the 3D design information. Accordingly, we investigate mul-
tiple side channels (e.g., acoustic and magnetic signals) and
develop a fusion model to infer the 3D digital design. Ex-
periment results show that by exploiting the side-channel
information collected by a smartphone, we can successfully
reconstruct the physical prints and their G-codes with the
Mean Tendency Error of 5.87% on regular designs and 9.67%
on complex designs. Our study reveals that IP protection in
the 3D printing process deserves more attention, especially
in the era of smartphones and internet of things.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst study to
explore practical side-channel attacks on 3D printers via the
smartphone. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We formalize IP information and side-channel attack
problem in 3D printing.
• We analyze the 3D printing mechanism and explore
multiple side-channel attacks against 3D printers via
the smartphone.
• We validate the feasibility and eﬀectiveness of the
smartphone-based side-channel attack against 3D print-
ers in a real case study.
• We discuss a few defense mechanisms to improve the
design of IP protection in 3D printing against side-
channel attacks.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: we introduce
the background of 3D printing and formulate the related
side-channel IP attack problem in Section 2. We investigate
the acoustic and magnetic side channels in Section 3 and
Section 4 respectively. Based on the analysis, we discover
a smartphone-based side-channel attack in Section 5. We
evaluate the performance of the approach in Section 6. Af-
terwards, we discuss limitation and describe future work in
Section 7. The defense mechanism is explored in Section
8. We review the related work in Section 9. The work is
summarized in Section 10.

MULATION
3D Printing Overview
2.1
study, we investigate 3D printers based on the Fused De-
position Modeling (FDM) technology because it is the most
commonly used type in the cost-eﬀective 3D printing market
[29].
2.2
3D Printing Mechanism
Figure 2: The semantic structure of a real 3D print-
ing G-code, which contains the ﬁle handler as well
as the object code.
Figure 2 shows a G-code example for an object, which
contains the ﬁle handler as well as the object code. The ﬁle
handler initializes the printer settings including unit, coor-
dinates, temperature, etc. In the object code section, each
instruction line controls the printer to perform certain op-
erations. Since it is fully compatible with commercial 3D
printers, successful IP attacks on the G-code will directly
result in the IP leakage and product replication. Consider-
ing that the G-code has a one-to-one relationship with the
printer operation, we plan to obtain the G-code by investi-
gating the mechanism of the printer operations.
Figure 1: The 3D printing chain includes the cyber
domain and the physical domain.
As shown in Figure 1, a standard 3D printing chain com-
prises the cyber domain and the physical domain. First, the
designer creates the object model in CAD (computer aided
design) software. The CAD software converts the CAD
model into the standard object ﬁle (STL), where the model
is represented by the surface geometry composed of trian-
gular facets. Second, after receiving the STL ﬁle, the CAM
(computer aided manufacturing) module slices the model
into uniform layers and generates the toolpath ﬁle. G-code
is the most widely used toolpath ﬁle format [11]. It includes
the operational instructions of 3D printers to control the fab-
ricating process. In other words, G-code naturally contains
all IP information of the 3D digital design, such as shapes,
dimensions and volumes. Last, the 3D printer conducts the
physical manufacturing and fabricates the object.
In this
Figure 3: A 3D FDM printer (Ultimaker 2 Go) and
its inner physical structure, including stepper mo-
tors, a heating nozzle, cooling fans and actuation
systems (transmission belt and deformed bar).
A typical FDM 3D printer is shown in Figure 3. The
printing header is placed at the top of the printer and can
only move in the horizontal plane. A nozzle is located at the
bottom of the header. A platform stays in the middle and
can move vertically. The coordinates of the platform are
illustrated in the ﬁgure. When the printing process starts,
the platform is raised up to an initial height (the ﬁrst layer)
along the Z axis. After the ﬁrst layer is printed in the X-
Y plane, the platform moves down by one layer height and
the printer prints the next layer upon the ﬁrst one. This
process continues till the end when the last layer is ﬁnished.
Particularly, there are four primitive operations involved.
Layer Movement infers whether the printer prints the layer
in the X-Y plane or changes layer in the Z axis. When
the printer prints in the X-Y plane, Header Movement de-
termines whether the header moves at the printing speed
or aligns the position with a fast speed. Axial Movement
corresponds with the speciﬁc axis the nozzle moves along
with in the X-Y plane. In each axis, the nozzle can move
in two directions, which is identiﬁed by Directional Move-
ment. During printing, the nozzle will be heated to change
the state of the material from solid into quasi-solid. Cooling
fans are equipped next to the nozzle to control its temper-
ature. There are four stepper motors, where three motors
control the platform or nozzle movement in diﬀerent axes
and the fourth one (extrusion motor) extrudes the material.
The printing operations are controlled by four motors via

operations are listed as follows:
• Layer Movement: whether the printer prints in a layer
• Header Movement: whether the header prints object
• Axial Movement: whether the nozzle moves in X or Y
• Directional Movement: which direction the nozzle moves
or change to the next layer;
or aligns position;
axis in the X-Y plane;
in the X or Y axis;
As described above, there are a few diﬀerent eletrome-
chanical parts in 3D printers. These parts will generate a
set of side-channel signals during the 3D printing process.
Given the ubiquity of smartphones, these observations mo-
tivate us to explore the possible side-channel attacks against
3D printing through smartphone built-in sensors.
2.3 Deﬁnition and Problem Formulation
In this part, we begin by deﬁning the key terms in the
3D printing study. We also formulate the side-channel IP
attack problem.
2.3.1 Terminologies
Deﬁnition 1 (IP Pile and IP Set): For a 3D printing
process, let s denote the IP pile that is achieved by certain
attack method. We deﬁne IP set S as a set that contains all
possible IP piles. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne s0 be the complete
IP pile that has all the information about the design and
the 3D printing process (the complete G-code). Therefore,
∀s ∈ S,∅ ⊂ s ⊆ s0.
(1)
Figure 4 shows two examples of s. The left one is the
complete G-code (s0) and the right one is the partial G-code
where part of the information is lost.
Deﬁnition 2 (Side-channel Pile): Let ˆu be the side-
channel data pile collected by the smartphone’s built-in sen-
sors. Correspondingly, it contains multiple side-channel sig-
nals in time series. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne u0 to be the com-
plete side-channel pile containing all possible side-channels
that are accessible by the smartphone. Therefore,
ˆu ⊆ u0.
(2)
Figure 5 is an example of the collected side-channel pile,
which contains the timestamp as well as the side-channel
signals.
Figure 4: Two examples of s. The left one is the
complete G-code and the right one is the partial G-
code.
Figure 5: An example of u, which is the side-channel
pile collected by the smartphone’s built-in sensors.
Deﬁnition 3 (Status Analysis Function): We denote the
status analysis function p as any function which can analyze
the 3D printer status at a speciﬁc timestamp. Therefore,
let P be a set which contains a number of selected status
analysis functions:
P = {p1(), ..., pk()}.
(3)
Deﬁnition 4 (IP Conversion Function): Let Q() be a
mapping function which converts a series of 3D printer sta-
tus into the standard IP pile (G-code). The speciﬁc im-
plementation of Q() responds to the G-code grammar and
mechanism of the 3D printer design.
2.3.2 Problem Formulation
Formulation 1 (Printing Plan Extraction): The goal of
printing plan extraction is to extract the mechanical and the
product-related information from the collected side-channel
pile U . Speciﬁcally, a status analysis function set P is ap-
plied. We deﬁne A be the result set after applying P on
ˆu:
A = {a1 ← p1(U ), ..., ak ← pk(U )}.
(4)
Therefore, A is the integration set of 3D printer status in
time series. It contains information such as the nozzle co-
ordinates, the platform height, the printing speed, the tem-
perature, etc.
Formulation 2 (IP Reconstruction): The purpose of IP
reconstruction is to achieve the reconstructed IP pile (s)
from the 3D printer status collection A using IP conver-
sion function Q(). Speciﬁcally, Let sIP−Leak be the recon-
structed IP pile obtained by the attacker. Therefore,
sIP−Leak = Q(A) ⊆ s0.
(5)
Formulation 3 (IP Attack Assessment): We verify the
reconstructed IP pile sIP−Leak and assess the 3D printing
IP attack into two levels. Speciﬁcally, we compare sIP−Leak
with the original IP set s0. We term Full IP Attack and
Partial IP Attack as follows:
(cid:40)
sIP−Leak
⇒ Full IP Attack
= s0
⊂ s0 ⇒ Partial IP Attack
(6)
2.4 Threat Model
After formulating the problem, we describe the adversary
attacking scenario and goal. Suppose a design is printed
by a 3D printer and the attacker attempts to obtain the
original IP pile s0 of the design for illegal usage. The at-
tacker does not have any prior knowledge about the target
printer and therefore, can be any common people with a
smartphone. After entering the space where the 3D printer
locates, the attacker places the smartphone near the printer
to collect side-channel information. Note that the smart-
phone does not need any physical contact with the printer.
This is completely unsuspicious due to the pervasiveness of
the smartphone nowadays and it is normal for people to
place their smartphones on the table. With the recording
application running on the smartphone, the attacker does
not even need to be at scene. During the printing process,
the smartphone records the side channel data simultane-
ously. Once the printing process is ﬁnished, the attacker
fetches the smartphone and obtains the side-channel data
pile ˆu. After applying the well-selected printer status analy-
sis functions, the attacker integrates the printer status A in
time series. In the end, the attacker performs the IP recon-
struction using IP conversion function Q() to retrieve the IP
pile sIP−Leak of the design. If sIP−Leak is the same as s0,
then the attacker performs a Full IP Attack. Otherwise,
it is a Partial IP Attack. The attack is unobtrusive and
easy to launch.
3. EXPLORING ACOUSTIC SIDE CHAN-
NEL
The determination of printer operations, especially the ax-
ial and directional movements of the nozzle, is of great im-
portance to reconstruct the product’s contour in each layer
as well as the design IP. There are four basic nozzle move-
ments with respect to the axis and the direction: X-Left, X-
Right, Y-Up, Y-Down. In this section, we validate whether
the smartphone’s acoustic data can be utilized to deduce the
movements.
To conduct the validation, we implement an application
on Nexus 5 (Android OS v6.01) to collect the acoustic data.
We separate the data into the training and the testing set.
Speciﬁcally, we train a support vector machine (SVM) model
based on the training set and evaluate the performance on
the testing set. The detailed experiment setup is described
in Section 4. Figure 6 depicts the validation results. The
classiﬁer well predicts the axial Movement, but poorly de-
tects the directional Movement in each axis. There are lots
of mis-classiﬁcation between X-Left and X-Right, or Y-Up
