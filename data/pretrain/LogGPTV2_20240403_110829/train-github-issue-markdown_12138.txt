### Detailed Description

For my project, I need to install OpenCV, and I chose the latest version, 3.4.0. I followed the installation instructions, and everything seemed to go well with no errors. However, when I tried to build and execute the `make` command, the process was interrupted with the following errors:

```
[ 39%] Generating perf_precomp.hpp.gch/opencv_perf_dnn_RELEASE.gch  
/home/pi/opencv-3.4.0/build/modules/dnn/perf_precomp.hpp:12:20: fatal error: canâ€™t write PCH file  
using namespace dnn;  
^  
compilation terminated.  
modules/dnn/CMakeFiles/pch_Generate_opencv_perf_dnn.dir/build.make:62: recipe for target 'modules/dnn/perf_precomp.hpp.gch/opencv_perf_dnn_RELEASE.gch' failed  
make[2]: *** [modules/dnn/perf_precomp.hpp.gch/opencv_perf_dnn_RELEASE.gch] Error 1

make[1]: *** [modules/dnn/CMakeFiles/pch_Generate_opencv_perf_dnn.dir/all] Error 2  
Makefile:160: recipe for target 'all' failed  
make: *** [all] Error 2
```

I attempted to disable C examples by setting the relevant option to `OFF`, but the failure persisted. What steps should I take to resolve this issue and successfully run OpenCV? Should I consider using a different version of OpenCV? I have already spent three days debugging this problem with no progress. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
