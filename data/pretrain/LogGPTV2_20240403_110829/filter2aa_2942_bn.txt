### Operational Downtime Losses Due to Cloud Service Provider Disruption

A disruption at a key cloud service provider can result in operational downtime, leading to financial losses ranging from $1.5 million to $15 million.

### Likelihood in Information Security Risk Analysis

In the context of information security risk analysis, likelihood is a weighted factor based on a subjective assessment of the probability that a given threat will exploit a specific vulnerability [CNSSI 4009]. General likelihood assumptions should be derived from the enterprise's broader risk management process and then refined to account for C-SCRM (Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management) implications. If these general assumptions do not yet exist, they must be developed. The likelihood analysis in the framing step sets the enterprise’s long-term assumptions about the relative likelihood of different adverse cybersecurity events. Likelihood can vary significantly in the short term based on internal and external conditions and must be regularly updated and refined during the assessment phase.

#### Adversarial and Non-Adversarial Cases

- **Adversarial Cases**: Likelihood determinations are made using intelligence trend data, historical data, and expert intuition, considering:
  - Adversary intent
  - Adversary capability
  - Adversary targeting

- **Non-Adversarial Cases (e.g., structural, environmental, accidental)**: Likelihood determinations rely on expert intuition and historical data. Historical data, when available, can help reduce uncertainty about which cybersecurity risks are likely to occur within the supply chain. Organizations can use internal sources such as past incident trackers or external sources like ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) to approximate the likelihood of different cyber events.

#### Contextualizing Likelihood

To ensure that likelihood is appropriately contextualized for decision-makers, enterprises should make time-bound likelihood estimates for cybersecurity events affecting the supply chain (e.g., likelihood within a given year). Likelihood analysis can leverage many of the same expert elicitation protocols as those used for consequences and impact. Both qualitative and quantitative forms of likelihood determinations may be employed, drawing on similar techniques.

### Likelihood Analysis Across Three Levels

Table G-5 outlines the considerations and methods specific to each level:

| Level | Likelihood Consideration | Methods |
|-------|--------------------------|---------|
| **Level 1** | - General threat and likelihood assumptions for the enterprise<br>- Level 2 and Level 3 likelihood findings<br>- Overall engagement models with suppliers that alter opportunities for contact with threat sources | - Analyze critical national infrastructure implications that may increase the enterprise’s target value.<br>- Refine analyses from Level 2 and Level 3 to determine aggregate exposure to threat source contact. |
| **Level 2** | - Mission/process level threat and likelihood assumptions<br>- Mission/process level engagement model with suppliers (e.g., criticality of assets interacted with)<br>- Level 3 findings for relevant systems | - Evaluate mission and business process level conditions that present opportunities for threat sources to come into contact with processes or assets via the supply chain.<br>- Evaluate the aggregate supply chain threat conditions facing key systems relied on by mission and business processes. |
| **Level 3** | - Enterprise system threat and likelihood assumptions<br>- Supplier and system target value<br>- Location and operating conditions<br>- Supplier and system security policies, processes, and controls<br>- Nature and degree of supplier contact with system (inputs, services) | - Analyze the nature of system inputs that come through the supply chain into the SDLC and that alter the likelihood of encountering threat sources.<br>- Evaluate the system roles in Level 1 and Level 2 processes that alter the target value for potential adversaries.<br>- Analyze supply chain characteristics (e.g., location of supplier) that may increase the likelihood that a system is affected by a threat source. |

### Risk Management Process Constraints

**Task 1-2: Identify constraints on the conduct of risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring activities within the enterprise.**

#### Supplemental Guidance

Identify the following two types of constraints to ensure that the cybersecurity supply chain is integrated into the agency risk management process:

1. **Agency Constraints**
2. **Supply Chain-Specific Constraints**

Table G-6 lists the specific agency and cybersecurity supply chain constraints:

| Level | Agency Constraints | Supply Chain Constraints |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Level 1** | - Enterprise policies, strategies, and governance<br>- Applicable laws and regulations<br>- Mission and business processes<br>- Enterprise processes (security, quality, etc.)<br>- Resource limitations | - Enterprise C-SCRM policy based on existing agency policies, strategies, and governance; applicable laws and regulations; mission and business processes; and enterprise processes<br>- Acquisition regulations and policy<br>- Available, mandated, or restricted sources of supply or products |
| **Level 2** | - Mission and business processes<br>- Criticality of processes<br>- Enterprise architecture<br>- Mission-level security policies | - C-SCRM mission and business requirements incorporated into mission and business processes and enterprise architecture<br>- Supplier service contracts, product warranties, and liability agreements |
| **Level 3** | - Functional requirements<br>- Security requirements | - Product and operational level C-SCRM capabilities<br>- Supplier-provided system component warranties and service agreements |

### C-SCRM Policy and Roles

One primary method for articulating constraints is through a policy statement or directive. An enterprise’s C-SCRM policy is a critical vehicle for directing C-SCRM activities, driven by applicable laws and regulations. This policy should support enterprise policies, including acquisition and procurement, information security, quality, and supply chain and logistics. It should address the goals, objectives, and requirements articulated by the overall agency strategic plan, mid-level mission and business process strategy, and internal or external customers. The C-SCRM policy should also define the integration points for C-SCRM with the agency’s Risk Management Process and SDLC.

C-SCRM policy should define the C-SCRM-related roles and responsibilities of the agency C-SCRM team and any dependencies or interactions among those roles. These roles include:

- **C-SCRM PMO**: Provides overarching guidance on cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.
- **Procurement Officer and Maintenance Engineer**: Responsible for identifying and replacing defective hardware.
- **Delivery Enterprise and Acceptance Engineers**: Verify that the system component is acceptable to receive into the acquiring enterprise.
- **System Integrator**: Responsible for system maintenance and upgrades.
- **System Security Engineer/Systems Engineer**: Ensures that information system security concerns are properly identified and addressed throughout the SDLC.
- **End User**: Uses cyber systems, components, and services.

### Risk Appetite and Tolerance

**Task 1-3: Identify the levels of risk appetite and tolerance across the enterprise.**

#### Supplemental Guidance

- **Risk Appetite**: Represents the types and amount of risk that an enterprise is willing to accept in pursuit of value [NISTIR 8286].
- **Risk Tolerance**: The readiness of the enterprise or stakeholder to bear the remaining risk after a risk response to achieve their objectives, influenced by legal or regulatory requirements [NISTIR 8286].

Enterprises should establish risk appetite and risk tolerance statements that set risk thresholds. These statements should be monitored and modified over time, and C-SCRM should align with these statements from the enterprise risk management process.

#### Examples of Risk Appetite and Tolerance

Table G-7 shows additional examples of how risk appetite and risk tolerance statements work together to frame risk within an enterprise:

| Enterprise Constraints | Supply Chain Constraints |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Low appetite for risk with respect to market objectives and requires 24/7 uptime | Low tolerance (i.e., no more than 5% probability) for service provider downtime that causes system disruptions to exceed contractual service level agreements (SLAs) by more than 10% |
| Low appetite for risk with respect to production objectives that require >99% on-time delivery of products to customers with national security missions | Near-zero tolerance (i.e., no more than 5% probability) for supply chain disruptions that cause production levels to fall below 99% of target threshold for military products |
| Low appetite for risk related to national security objectives that require 99% effectiveness of security processes | Low tolerance (i.e., no more than 1% of contractor access authorizations) for inappropriate contractor access that exceeds authorized windows by more than 10% in systems with classified information |
| Moderate appetite for risk related to operational objectives of non-mission critical areas that require 99.5% availability | Moderate tolerance (i.e., no more than 15% probability) for system component failures causing non-critical system disruptions that exceed recovery time objectives by more than 10% |

### Priorities and Trade-offs

**Task 1-4: Identify priorities and trade-offs considered by the enterprise in managing risk.**

#### Supplemental Guidance

Priorities and trade-offs are closely linked to the enterprise’s risk appetite and tolerance statements, which communicate the amount of risk that is acceptable and tolerable to the enterprise in pursuit of its objectives. Priorities take the form of long-term strategic objectives or near-term strategic imperatives that alter the risk decision calculus. From priorities and trade-offs, C-SCRM receives critical strategic context required for Response step activities, such as Evaluation of Alternatives and Risk Response Decision.

Priority and trade-off considerations will differ across the three levels:

- **Level 1**: May favor existing supplier relationships in established regions at the expense of new supplier cost advantages to maintain confidence and stability.
- **Level 2**: May favor centralized C-SCRM governance models that cover product teams for greater security practice standardization.
- **Level 3**: May favor system components/sub-components produced in certain geographies to avoid environmental or geopolitical risks.
