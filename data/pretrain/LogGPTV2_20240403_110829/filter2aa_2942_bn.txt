Disruption at a key cloud service provider results in operational downtime losses between 
$1.5 – $15 million dollars. 
Likelihood 
In an information security risk analysis, likelihood is a weighted factor based on a subjective 
analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability 
[CNSSI 4009]. General likelihood assumptions should be inherited from the enterprise’s 
enterprise risk management process and refined to account for C-SCRM-specific implications. 
However, the general assumptions may need to be developed if they do not yet exist. The 
likelihood analysis in the Frame step sets the enterprise’s long-term assumptions about the 
relative likelihood of different adverse cybersecurity events. Likelihood is subject to extreme 
short-term variations based on point-in-time conditions (i.e., internal and external) and must be 
updated and refined as part of the Assess step. 
In adversarial cases, a likelihood determination may be made using intelligence trend data, 
historical data, and expert intuition on 1) adversary intent, 2) adversary capability, and 3) 
adversary targeting. In non-adversarial cases (e.g., structural, environmental, accidental), 
likelihood determinations will draw on expert intuition and historical data. When available, 
historical data may help further reduce uncertainty about which cybersecurity risks throughout 
the supply chain are probable to occur. Organizations may find historical data by looking to 
internal sources such as past incident trackers or external sources such as ISACs in order to 
approximate the likelihood of experiencing different cyber events. Likelihood analysis can 
leverage many of the same expert elicitation protocols as consequences and impact. Similar to 
consequences and impact, likelihood determinations may rely on qualitative or quantitative 
forms and draw on similar techniques. To ensure that likelihood is appropriately contextualized 
for decision makers, enterprises should make time-bound likelihood estimates for cybersecurity 
events that affect the supply chain (e.g., likelihood within a given year).

Agencies should identify which approaches they will use to determine the likelihood of a supply 
chain cybersecurity compromise, consistent with the overall approach used by the agency’s risk 
management process. Agencies should ensure that appropriate procedures are in place to 
thoroughly document any risk analysis assumptions that lead to the tabulation of the final risk

exposure, especially in cases where high or critical impact risks are involved. Visibility into 
assumptions may be critical in enabling decision makers to take action.   
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS CONSTRAINTS  
TASK 1-2: Identify constraints64 on the conduct of risk assessment, risk response, and risk 
monitoring activities within the enterprise.  
Supplemental Guidance  
Identify the following two types of constraints to ensure that the cybersecurity supply chain is 
integrated into the agency risk management process: 
1. Agency constraints  
2. Supply chain-specific constraints 
Agency constraints serve as an overall input to framing the cybersecurity supply chain policy at 
Level 1, mission requirements at Level 2, and system-specific requirements at Level 3. Table G-
6 lists the specific agency and cybersecurity supply chain constraints. Supply chain constraints, 
such as the C-SCRM policy and C-SCRM requirements, may need to be developed if they do not 
exist.

warranties and service agreements 
One the primary methods by which constraints are articulated is via a policy statement or 
directive. An enterprise’s C-SCRM policy is a critical vehicle for directing C-SCRM activities. 
Driven by applicable laws and regulations, this policy should support enterprise policies, 
including acquisition and procurement, information security, quality, and supply chain and 
logistics. The C-SCRM policy should address the goals, objectives, and requirements articulated 
by the overall agency strategic plan, mid-level mission and business process strategy, and 
internal or external customers. The C-SCRM policy should also define the integration points for 
C-SCRM with the agency’s Risk Management Process and SDLC. 
C-SCRM policy should define the C-SCRM-related roles and responsibilities of the agency C-
SCRM team and any dependencies or interactions among those roles. C-SCRM-related roles will 
articulate responsibilities for collecting supply chain cybersecurity threat intelligence, conducting 
risk assessments, identifying and implementing risk-based mitigations, and performing 
monitoring processes. Identifying and validating roles will help to specify the amount of effort 
required to implement the C-SCRM plan. Examples of C-SCRM-related roles include: 
• C-SCRM PMO that provides overarching guidance on cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain to engineering decisions that specify and select cyber products as the system 
design is finalized 
• Procurement officer and maintenance engineer responsible for identifying and replacing 
defective hardware  
• Delivery enterprise and acceptance engineers who verify that the system component is 
acceptable to receive into the acquiring enterprise 
• System integrator responsible for system maintenance and upgrades, whose staff resides 
in the acquirer facility and uses system integrator development infrastructure and the 
acquirer operational infrastructure 
• System security engineer/systems engineer responsible for ensuring that information 
system security concerns are properly identified and addressed throughout the SDLC 
• The end user of cyber systems, components, and services 
C-SCRM requirements should be guided by C-SCRM policies, mission and business processes, 
their criticality at Level 2, and known functional and security requirements at Level 3. 
RISK APPETITE AND TOLERANCE  
TASK 1-3: Identify the levels of risk appetite and tolerance across the enterprise.

Supplemental Guidance  
On a broad level, risk appetite represents the types and amount of risk that an enterprise is 
willing to accept in pursuit of value [NISTIR 8286]. Conversely, risk tolerance is the enterprise 
or stakeholder’s readiness to bear the remaining risk after a risk response in order to achieve their 
objectives with the consideration that such tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory 
requirements [NISTIR 8286]. This definition is adapted from COSO, which states that risk 
tolerance is the acceptable level of variation relative to achievement of a specific objective. 
Often, risk tolerance is best measured in the same units as those used to measure the related 
objective [COSO 2011]. When establishing a risk management framework, it is recommended 
that enterprises establish risk appetite and risk tolerance statements that set risk thresholds. Then, 
where applicable, C-SCRM should align with risk appetite and tolerance statements from the 
enterprise risk management process. Once established, risk appetite and risk tolerance should be 
monitored and modified over time. For C-SCRM, these statements should be contextualized to 
inform decisions in the C-SCRM domain. Those responsible for C-SCRM across the enterprise 
should work with and support enterprise leaders on the development of C-SCRM-related risk 
appetite and risk tolerance statements. This should be done in accordance with criteria provided 
from the enterprise risk strategy (e.g., based on ERM risk categories).  
Risk appetite and tolerance statements strongly influence the decisions made about C-SCRM 
across the three levels. Some enterprises may define risk appetite and risk tolerance as part of 
their broader enterprise risk management activities. In enterprises without a clearly defined risk 
appetite, Level 1 stakeholders should collaborate with enterprise leadership to define and 
articulate the enterprise’s appetite for risk within the scope of the C-SCRM program’s mandates. 
Enterprises with multiple organizations may choose to tailor risk appetite statements for specific 
organizations and mission and business processes. In general, risk appetite at Level 1 may be set 
to empower the enterprise to meet its value objectives (e.g., high appetite for supplier risk in 
support of reducing operating costs by 5 %). At Level 2 and Level 3, an organization’s risk 
appetite statements are operationalized through risk tolerance statements. For example, an 
organization with a low appetite for supply chain cybersecurity risk may issue risk tolerance 
statements that necessitate restraint and control by Level 2 and Level 3 decision makers as they 
pursue strategic value (e.g., tolerance statement crafted based on strict production targets for an 
organization that supports a national security-related mission).

Fig. G-4: Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance 
Together, risk appetite and risk tolerance provide expectations and acceptable boundaries for 
performance against the organization’s strategic objectives. Figure G-4 illustrates how risk 
appetite and risk tolerance may be used as guidelines for the organization’s operational decision 
makers. Risk tolerance may be set with boundaries that exceed risk appetite to provide a degree 
of flexibility for achieving the organization’s strategic objectives. However, operational decision 
makers should strive to remain within risk appetite during normal conditions and exceed the 
boundaries only as absolutely necessary (e.g., to capitalize on significant opportunities, avoid 
highly adverse conditions). Observed periods of performance in the Review Zone, which lies 
outside of risk appetite boundaries, should trigger a review of operational decisions and defined 
risk appetite and tolerance statements. The review is critical to ensuring that the organization’s 
appetite for risk remains appropriate and applicable given the organization’s internal and external 
operating conditions. For example, an organization operating during a global pandemic may find 
it necessary to take on additional levels of cyber risk exposure via alternative suppliers in order 
to circumvent supply shortages. Figure G-5 below provides an illustrative risk appetite and risk 
tolerance review process.

In some cases, organizational leaders may find it necessary to rebalance guidance to avoid excess 
risk aversion behavior (i.e., performance below appetite) or excess risk-seeking behavior (i.e., 
performance above appetite) by decision makers.

99.5 % availability 
Moderate tolerance (i.e., no more than 15 % 
probability) for system component failures causing 
non-critical system disruptions that exceed recovery 
time objectives by more than 10 % 
To ensure that leadership has the appropriate information when making risk-based decisions, 
enterprises should establish measures (e.g., key performance indicators [KPIs], key risk 
indicators [KRIs]) to measure performance against defined risk appetite and risk tolerance 
statements. The identification of corresponding data sources for measurement should play a key 
role in the enterprise’s defined processes for setting and refining risk appetite and tolerance 
statements. Risk appetite and risk tolerance should be treated as dynamic by the enterprise. This 
requires periodic updates and revisions based on internal (e.g., new leadership, strategy) and 
external (e.g., market, environmental) changes that impact the enterprise.  
Enterprises should consider supply chain cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, constraints, and 
criticality when establishing, operationalizing, and maintaining the overall level of risk appetite 
and risk tolerance.65 
PRIORITIES AND TRADE-OFFS  
TASK 1-4: Identify priorities and trade-offs considered by the enterprise in managing risk.  
Supplemental Guidance 
Priorities and trade-offs are closely linked to the enterprise’s risk appetite and tolerance 
statements, which communicate the amount of risk that is acceptable and tolerable to the 
enterprise in pursuit of its objectives. Priorities will take the form of long-term strategic 
objectives or near-term strategic imperatives that alter the risk decision calculus. From priorities 
and trade-offs, C-SCRM then receives critical strategic context required for Response step 
activities, such as Evaluation of Alternatives and Risk Response Decision. As a part of 
identifying priorities and trade-offs, enterprises should consider risk appetite, risk tolerance, 
supply chain cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, constraints, and criticality.  
Priority and trade-off considerations will manifest different across the three levels. At Level 1, 
priority and trade-off considerations may favor existing supplier relationships in established 
65 The governance structures of federal departments and agencies vary widely (see [NIST SP 800-100, Section 2.2.2]). 
Regardless of the governance structure, individual agency risk decisions should apply to the agency and any subordinate 
organizations but not vice versa.

regions at the expense of new supplier cost advantages due to a desire to maintain confidence 
and stability. At Level 2, priority and trade-off considerations may favor centralized C-SCRM 
governance models that cover product teams in favor of greater security practice standardization. 
At Level 3, priorities and trade-offs may favor system components/sub-components that are 
produced in certain geographies in an effort to avoid environmental or geopolitical risks to the
