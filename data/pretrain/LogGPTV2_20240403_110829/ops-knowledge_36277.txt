User: How to configure domain name resolution server to resolve multiple domain names?
Assistant: To configure the domain name resolution server to resolve multiple domain names, follow the steps below: 1. Register the domain name to be resolved with the domain name registrar, and record the address of the domain name server (NS record or DNS record). 2. Deploy a DNS server and install DNS software (such as BIND, PowerDNS, etc.) on the server. 3. Configure multiple domain names to be resolved and their related records (for example: A record, CNAME record, MX record, etc.) on the DNS server. 4. Point the NS record or DNS record of the domain name registered at the registrar to the IP address of the deployed DNS server (you can use the A record to point to the IP address of the DNS server, or use the NS record to point to the host name of the DNS server). 5. Under the DNS server, start the corresponding DNS service (for example: named), and ensure that the service is running normally. 6. Check whether the configuration of the DNS service is correct and whether domain name resolution is available. 7. If there is a DNS resolution failure, you can check the log file of the DNS server to determine the problem. It should be noted that for load balancing, high availability and security requirements, additional configuration and optimization may be required. The specific configuration method and details need to be adjusted according to the actual situation and requirements.
