User: Based on the given IP address and subnet mask, calculate the network address and broadcast address.
Assistant: The calculation method of network address and broadcast address is as follows: 1. Perform binary conversion on IP address and subnet mask. 2. For the subnet mask, perform a mathematical operation on all 1 bits to find the number of 1s in the mask. For example, in 255.255.255.0, the number of 1s is 24. 3. Divide the binary IP address according to the subnet mask, and the divided part is the network address and the host address. 4. The network address is the result of setting all the host addresses of the IP address to 0. 5. The broadcast address is the result of setting all the host addresses of the IP address to 1. 6. If a bit in the subnet mask is 0, then this bit must be 0 in the network address or broadcast address, because both the network address and the broadcast address are the result of the bitwise AND of the IP address and the subnet mask. For example, suppose the IP address is 192.168.0.100 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. According to the above method, it can be obtained: 1. The binary IP address is: 11000000 10101000 00000000 01100100 2. The binary subnet mask is: 11111111 11111111 1111 1111 00000000 3. The number of 1s in the subnet mask is 24, because 24 bits are 1s. 4. The binary network address is: 11000000 10101000 00000000 00000000, which is 192.168.0.0. 5. The binary broadcast address is: 11000000 10101000 00000000 11111111, namely 192.168.0.255. 6. The last bit of the subnet mask is 0, so the last bit of the network address and broadcast address must be 0.
