### 4.1 Analysis of Privacy Policies in Voice-App Stores

#### 4.1.1 Duplicate and Missing Privacy URLs
- **Duplicate URLs:** We identified 239 skills with duplicate privacy policy URLs, totaling 1,012 instances.
- **Top Duplicate URLs:**
  - http://corp.patch.com/privacy
  - http://www.lottostrategies.com/script/showpage/1001029/b/privacy_policy.html

#### 4.1.2 Official Voice-Apps Violating Requirements
- **Google and Amazon Violations:** We found that both Google and Amazon have official voice-apps that do not meet their own privacy policy requirements.
- **Example:** The "Weather" skill by Amazon asks for the user's location but does not provide a privacy policy (Figure 5). This skill is often automatically enabled on Alexa devices, demonstrating a violation of Amazon’s own requirement.

**Figure 5: An official "Weather" skill lacks a privacy policy despite collecting user location data.**

- **Amazon Official Skills:** 
  - **Total Collected:** 98
  - **With Privacy Policy URLs:** 59 (all are duplicates)
  - **Breakdown of Links:**
    - 30 links to general Amazon privacy notice
    - 6 links to AWS privacy notice, Amazon payment privacy, or Alexa terms of use
    - 23 links unrelated to privacy (17 to Amazon homepage, 6 to insurance pages)

- **Google Official Actions:**
  - **Total Collected:** 110
  - **Without Privacy Policy:** 101
  - **With Privacy Policy:** 9 (links to two different general Google privacy policies)

**Conclusion:** Both platforms fail to enforce their own requirements for app-specific privacy policies.

### 4.2 Content Analysis of Privacy Policies

#### 4.2.1 Irrelevance to Specific Voice-Apps
- **General Privacy Policies:** Many skills and actions use general privacy policies that do not specifically address the data practices of the voice-app.
- **Mentioning App Names:**
  - **Alexa Skills:** 3,233 out of 17,952 (18%) mention the skill name.
  - **Google Actions:** 1,038 out of 1,967 (53%) mention the action name.

- **Kids Skills:** Some kids' skills mention data collection in their privacy policies, which is prohibited. For example, "Headspace Bedtime Story" (Figure 6) discloses personal data collection, violating Amazon’s privacy requirements.

**Figure 6: Privacy policy URL provided with a kids skill "Headspace Bedtime Story" disclosing the collection of personal data.**

- **Data Collection Issues:** 137 skills in the kids category provide general privacy policies without specific details on data collection, potentially violating Amazon’s privacy requirements.

#### 4.2.2 Zero Data Practices
- **Data Practices Identified:**
  - **Average Data Practices:**
    - **Alexa Skills:** 24.2
    - **Google Actions:** 16.6
  - **Maximum Data Practices:** 428 (likely a general policy)

- **Zero Data Practices:**
  - **Alexa Skills:** 1,117
    - **Issues:**
      - 670 URLs lead to unrelated pages
      - 251 URLs lead to actual privacy policy pages with no data practices
      - 120 URLs redirect to other pages
      - 76 URLs lead to non-existent pages

  - **Google Actions:** 95
    - **Issues:**
      - 37 URLs lead to non-existent pages
      - 25 URLs are privacy policies with no data practices
      - 11 URLs lead to unrelated pages
      - 5 URLs contain the link to the actual privacy policy
      - 17 actions provide privacy policies as Google Docs with incorrect permissions

#### 4.2.3 Inconsistency Between Privacy Policy and Description
- **Inconsistent Skills:**
  - **Total Identified:** 50
  - **Data Types Requested:**
    - 19 skills ask for address or location
    - 10 skills request email/account/password
    - 7 skills ask for name
    - 4 skills require birthday
    - Other skills ask for phone number, contact, gender, or health data

- **Example:**
  - **Skill:** "Running Outfit Advisor"
  - **Issue:** Collects gender information but does not mention this in the privacy policy (Figure 9).

**Figure 9: "Running Outfit Advisor" skill mentions collecting gender information in the description but not in the privacy policy.**

#### 4.2.4 Missing Required Privacy Policies
- **Google Actions:** 234 actions do not have a privacy policy, violating Google’s requirement.
- **Amazon Alexa Skills:** Developers can collect personal data through the conversational interface without a privacy policy, bypassing Amazon’s requirement.

#### 4.2.5 Cross-Platform Inconsistency
- **Different Privacy Policies:**
  - **Total Pairs Identified:** 23
  - **Examples:**
    - "Did Thanos Kill Me" (Alexa: General privacy policy, Google: Specific privacy policy)

**Table 7: Same voice-apps with different privacy policies on two VA platforms.**

#### 4.2.6 Potential Noncompliance with Legal Regulations
- **COPPA Violations:**
  - **Skills in Kids Category:** 3 skills (e.g., "First Name Analysis," "Haircut Scheduler") lack a privacy policy, violating COPPA regulations.

- **HIPAA and CalOPPA:**
  - **Health Information:** Some skills can collect health-related information without a privacy policy, potentially violating HIPAA.
  - **General Information:** 137 kids skills provide general privacy policies without specifics, potentially violating CalOPPA.

### 4.3 Usability Issues

#### 4.3.1 Lengthy Privacy Policies
- **Length:**
  - **Average Words:**
    - **Alexa Skills:** 2,336
    - **Google Actions:** 1,479
  - **Reading Time:** 12 minutes for 1,500 words

- **Impact:** Long policies discourage users from reading them, making it difficult to understand data practices.

#### 4.3.2 Hard to Access
- **Current Architecture:**
  - **VA Devices:** No direct access to privacy policies on devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home.
  - **Access Methods:** Users must find the privacy policy URL on the store webpage or companion app.

- **Permissions Prompt:** Permissions are shown in the smartphone companion app, but developers can collect data during conversations without a privacy policy.

### 5. User Study

#### 5.1 Methodology
- **Platform:** Amazon Mechanical Turk
- **Participants:** USA residents with a HIT acceptance rate >98% and at least 500 approved HITs.
- **Objective:** Understand user engagement with privacy policies and identify issues.

#### 5.2 Findings
- **Frequency of Checking Privacy Policies:** Participants rarely check privacy policies.
- **Usability Issues:** Length and accessibility of privacy policies are major concerns.

**Conclusion:** Improving the usability and accessibility of privacy policies is crucial for enhancing user trust and compliance with legal regulations.
