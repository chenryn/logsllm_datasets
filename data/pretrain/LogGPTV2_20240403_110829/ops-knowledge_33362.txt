Question: "A web application developer needs to secure a session cookie to prevent CSRF attacks. Given the following four options to configure the session cookie, which option(s) will effectively mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks and adhere to best security practices?"
 "A": "Set the cookie with `sameSite: 'None'` and ensure all requests requiring the cookie are made using the POST HTTP method."
 "B": "Set the cookie with `sameSite: 'Strict'` to ensure the cookie is only sent with same-domain requests."
 "C": "Set the cookie with `sameSite: 'Lax'` which sends the cookie with top-level cross-domain GET requests but not with other methods that could mutate state."
 "D": "Do not set a SameSite attribute, relying solely on the secure flag to encrypt the cookie with HTTPS."
