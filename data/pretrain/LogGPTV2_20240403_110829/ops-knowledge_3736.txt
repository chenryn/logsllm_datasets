User: How to set up SSH login security of a Linux server to prevent unauthorized user logins and attacks?
Assistant: The following are some measures I know about setting up SSH login security for Linux servers for your reference: 1. Change the default SSH port number: Usually the default SSH port number is 22. Unauthenticated users may attempt to log in to your server by brute-forcing passwords. Therefore, changing the SSH default port number can reduce these attacks. 2. Disable root user remote login: users with root authority can make changes to your server, and prohibiting root user remote login can improve server security. 3. Login with key: login with key is a more secure method, and it is more difficult to crack than login with password. Generate the public key and private key and add the public key to the server, then use the private key to log in. 4. Disable password login: Disabling password login can further improve the security of the SSH server, which can be set by editing the SSH configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config. 5. Use Fail2Ban software: Fail2Ban is an automated protection software against brute force cracking and DDoS attacks, which can detect cracking attempts made by a certain IP address and prevent them from logging in. 6. Firewall: Configuring a firewall can restrict access to the SSH port. For example, use iptables settings to allow only specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses to access the SSH port. 7. Use SELinux: SELinux is a mandatory access control mechanism that restricts certain users' access to system resources. This can help prevent unauthorized users from accessing the server.
