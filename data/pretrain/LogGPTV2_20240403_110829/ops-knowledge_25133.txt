User: I have a python script which runs on a Windows machine. On this machine I have mounted a Samba filesystem (on a Linux host).
When I now try to change file permissions on the filesystem with os.chmod(S_IXUSR) it doesn't set the excutable permission, since it is hardcoded in Windows to not do anything as some research I did suggests. 
Do I have any chance to change unix file permissions from a Windows host using python?
Assistant: Short answer: No.
Slightly longer answer: It would perhaps not be impossible to write a Windows Samba driver which supports this, but you seem to be asking for an existing solution.
