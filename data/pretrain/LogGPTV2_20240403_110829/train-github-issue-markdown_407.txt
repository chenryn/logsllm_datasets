Referring the documentation provided by playwright, seems like the hooks
(example: afterAll / beforeAll) can be used only inside a spec/ test file as
below:
// example.spec.ts  
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
test.beforeAll(async () => {  
console.log('Before tests');  
});
test.afterAll(async () => {  
console.log('After tests');  
});
test('my test', async ({ page }) => {  
// ...  
});
My question: is there any support where there can be only one AfterAll() or
beforeAll() hook in one single file which will be called for every test files
? the piece of code that i want to have inside the afterAll and beforeAll is
common for all the test/ specs files and i dont want to have the same
duplicated in all the spec files/ test file.  
Any suggestion or thoughts on this?
TIA
