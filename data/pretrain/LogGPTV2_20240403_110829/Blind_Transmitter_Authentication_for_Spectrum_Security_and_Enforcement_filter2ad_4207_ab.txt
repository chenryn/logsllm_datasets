terference depends on the BTA scheme utilized to embed
the authentication signal into the message signal.
Blind Authentication: The blind receiver is not the in-
tended recipient of the transmitted signal, and hence it does
not know the transmission parameters, e.g., frame format,
preamble samples, modulation scheme, and pilot samples.
However, the blind receiver needs to be able to verify the
authentication signal. This criterion takes into account the
minimum amount of information needed by Dave to extract
the authentication signal from the received signal.
Security: There are four facets of security that need to
be considered: privacy, integrity, impersonation, and re-
play. To protect the privacy of Alice from Eve, the BTA
scheme should not reveal the identity of Alice through the
authentication signal. To ensure integrity, the BTA scheme
should prevent Eve from modifying/corrupting Alice’s mes-
sages without being detected by Dave. To thwart imperson-
ation, the BTA scheme should prevent Eve from creating
valid proofs of authenticity for her messages that can be used
to impersonate Alice. To thwart replay attacks launched by
Eve, Alice’s authentication signal should incorporate coun-
termeasures that deter the interception and replay of the
authentication signal.
4. DESCRIPTION OF FEAT
We propose a BTA scheme that we refer to as Frequency
oﬀset Embedding for Authenticating Transmitters (FEAT).
In the following text, we describe FEAT in the context of
the authentication scenario depicted in Figure 1.
Alice embeds the authentication signal in the form of em-
bedded frequency oﬀset (EFO) in each frame of the mes-
sage signal in the baseband. The embedded signal in the
baseband is sent to the oscillator where it gets up-converted
and transmitted along with the inherent carrier frequency
oﬀset (CFO) due to the inaccurate oscillator. This over-
all frequency oﬀset does not aﬀect the decoding procedure
of the message signal by Bob and Charlie as being the in-
tended receivers, they estimate and correct any frequency
oﬀset present in the received signal with the help of the
preamble symbols, and the pilot samples. Dave estimates
the authentication signal blindly. Further, we discuss in de-
tail the generation of the message signal (M Sa) and authen-
tication signal (ASa), and embedding of ASa into M Sa by
Alice followed by extraction of the message signal (M Sb)

message signal (M Sc) by Charlie, extraction of the authen-
tication signal (ASd) by Dave, and veriﬁcation of ASb and
ASd. The notations for the important parameters used in
the paper are provided in Table 1.
Generation of M Sa: The message data to be transmit-
ted is assumed to be a sequence of quadrature amplitude
modulated (QAM) samples which are statistically indepen-
dent and identically distributed with zero mean and average
power represented by σ2
s . For each OFDM symbol, Alice
generates Nf samples by taking the Inverse Fast Fourier
Transform (IFFT) of Nu QAM samples corresponding to
Nu non-zero sub-carriers loaded with data or pilot samples.
The last Nc samples out of the Nf samples are repeated at
the beginning of the Nf samples as the cyclic preﬁx (CP) to
generate an OFDM symbol of No = Nf + Nc samples. The
message signal is transmitted in frames, and each frame con-
tains Ns = Np + Nd OFDM symbols, where Np represents
the number of symbols carrying the preamble and Nd rep-
resents the symbols carrying data. The samples of a frame
is represented by {s(n)}, where n = 0, 1,··· Ns · No − 1.
Figure 2 illustrates the symbol and frame structure of M Sa.
Generation of ASa: The authentication signal contains
three pieces of information:
frequency, location and time
(represented by F , L and T , respectively) at which the
message signal is authorized to be transmitted. A time-
stamp, represented by T S, is also used to prevent replay of
the authentication signal. This information, represented by
Am = {T S, F, L, T}, is digitally signed using a privacy pre-
serving group signature scheme [3], and the signature of Am
is represented by sign(Am). Here, we assume that a unique
membership certiﬁcate has been issued by a designated cer-
tiﬁcate authority (CA) to each member (including Alice) of
the group of secondary users, and Dave has access to all
the information available at the designated CA. Hence, one
authentication sequence is given by As = {Am, sign(Am)}.
Each As is channel-coded with an error-correcting code (e.g.,
convolution code), and synchronization and guard bits are
appended to generate ASa of Ka bits.
Embedding of ASa into M Sa: For embedding the
authentication signal into the message signal, we propose a
novel scheme called Frame Frequency M odulation (FFM)
where the frequency oﬀset of each frame of the message sig-
nal is modiﬁed (modulated) according to the authentication
signal. FFM of order M (M -FFM) is represented by a set
of M possible frequency oﬀsets corresponding to M = 2b
possible b-bit authentication symbols. Here, an authentica-
tion symbol is deﬁned as a set of b authentication bits, and
is obtained by using b-bit Gray code. The set of frequency
oﬀsets in M -FFM can be represented by {fm} such that

where m = 1, 2,··· , M , and fa is the maximum positive
frequency oﬀset that can be used to embed the authentica-
tion signal into a frame of the message signal. Figures 3a
and 3b represent the mapping schemes for 1-bit authentica-
tion symbols and 2-bit authentication symbols, respectively.
Note that fM−m+1 = −fm, for m = 1, 2,··· , M
2 .
In kth frame of the message signal, we embed the authenti-
cation symbol, represented by ak, by embedding a frequency
oﬀset, fk. Hence, for n = 0, 1··· Ns · No − 1, each sample
of a frame of the embedded signal in the baseband is given
by x(n) = s(n) · ej2π
n, where Fs is the sampling fre-
quency. The embedded signal is up-converted to the carrier
frequency (Fc) and transmitted. Assuming that CFO due
to the inaccurate oscillator at Alice is ft, the total frequency
oﬀset of the transmitted signal is fk + ft.

Extraction of M Sb, ASb, and M Sc: After down-
converting and sampling the received signal, Bob, with the
knowledge of the preamble symbols and the pilot samples,
can estimate and correct the frequency oﬀset in each frame
and extract the message signal, M Sb. Also, Bob maps the
frequency oﬀset in each of the frames to the closest one
among {fm}, for m = 1, 2··· M , given by equation (1)
and estimates the authentication signal, ASb. Charlie, also
equipped with the knowledge of the preamble symbols and
the pilot samples, can correct the frequency oﬀset in each
frame and extract the message signal, M Sc. Since Charlie
is not interested in the frequency oﬀsets of the frames of the
message signal, the information contained in these frequency
oﬀsets is simply discarded by Charlie.
Extraction of ASd: Dave, the blind receiver, does not
have the knowledge about the preamble symbols or the pilots
samples inserted in the message signal. Hence, to blindly es-
timate the transmitted authentication signal, Dave needs to
carry out four tasks—signal detection and sampling, sym-
bol synchronization, frame synchronization, and frame fre-
quency estimation.
Signal Detection and Sampling: Since Dave has the knowl-
edge of the center frequency and sampling frequency of the
transmitted signal, it down-converts and samples the re-

Symbol Synchronization: Estimation of symbol bound-
ceived signal in the considered frequency band. Assum-
ing a Gaussian channel, Dave observes the received sig-
nal with Nr discreet samples which can be represented by
n · x(n) + w(n) for n = 0, 1,··· Nr − 1, where
r(n) = ej2π fr
fr is the frequency oﬀset due to the oscillator at Dave. The
additive noise w(n) is assumed to be independent of x(n),
and circularly complex Gaussian with zero mean, and σ2
w
variance.
It can be observed that the frequency oﬀset in
each frame of the received signal has one constant part,
fc = ft +fr, and a variable part, fk, carrying authentication
signal.
aries includes estimation of the IFFT size ((cid:98)Nf ), the CP size
((cid:98)Nc) and the sample oﬀset ((cid:98)α). Dave estimates these three
Λ(r, (cid:101)Nf , (cid:101)Nc,(cid:101)α), can be expressed by
parameters using the sub-optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
scheme described in [33] which utilizes the correlation in the
received signal induced due to CP. The likelihood function,
