▪ As white hats, phishing should be just as easy as for black hats, right? 
• Write a crafty e-mail that directs readers to a web site. 
• Build a one-form web site to collect credentials. 
• Get client approval of the product of steps 1 and 2. 
• Send e-mail to as many people as possible at company. 
• Watch the passwords fly in. 
▪ Sometimes you get lucky and it really is this easy.  Whew! 
▪ Expect 10–40% of employees to give their passwords.
Why isn't this simple?

"""
▪ Larry once had a phishing campaign with a success 
rate in excess of 100%. 
▪ The company targeted a subset of its employees. 
▪ His "give us passwords or we cut off your access" call 
to action worked really well. 
▪ They forwarded the phishing e-mail to their co-workers! 
• Oh, and tested the privilege-separated accounts. 
• All of them…
Success Rates in Excess of 100%

"""
▪ A professional phishing engagement should "harden" 
an organization's staff. 
▪ More specifically: 
• increase individual resilience in every staff member. 
• train the organization in collaborative detection. 
▪ After a couple phishing campaigns, employees will 
detect scams and report at higher percentages.
Why Phish?
4
"""
▪ Most people’s first few professional attempts don’t go 
this well.  
▪ Years ago, when we started phishing, we'd watch our 
consultants get so frustrated with the situation.  We 
got better. 
▪ The rest of this talk details ours and others' frustrating 
situations, teaching you how to avoid them entirely 
and achieve success.
Why this talk?

Layer 8
"""
▪ This isn’t about red team phishing - we do that too, but it 
rarely involves these challenges. 
▪ Eleven stories of failure, each with specific solutions. 
▪ Generalizing… 
▪ Setting up any professional phishing campaign involves: 
• Collaboration 
• Communication 
• Negotiation 
▪ For that matter, anything in life with more than one person 
involves negotiation.
TL;DR
6
"""
▪ Red Team phishing is phishing solely to get initial access, not to test everyone 
▪ Incredibly small target pool - usually 1-2 e-mails 
• Manually determine targets 
• Use open source recon: LinkedIn, Connect.com, Company website 
▪ Low and slow - we must not get caught 
• It can help to have a pre-established persona with a LinkedIn profile 
• Pretext focused on specific job function, e.g. recruiters open resumes 
• Payload needs to be stealthy, topical and never cause suspicion 
▪ Pro-tip: use Gmail or Office365 since many organizations whitelist these.
Penetration Test Phishing vs Red Team Phishing

"""
▪ We're going to tell you eleven stories from real life experience. 
▪ Each informed the way that we run a phishing engagement. 
▪ We give this advice as if you fill one of these roles: 
• Consultant working for multiple clients 
• Security professional inside a single organization
Eleven Stories

"""
▪ We gave our client three scenarios to choose from. 
▪ He chose one, we got the pretext built by Wednesday, sent the URL to the client 
and told him we'd be sending the e-mails on Friday. 
▪ He showed the URL to his manager on Thursday, who objected to the entire 
scenario. 
▪ You've just blown your schedule to bits.

"""
▪ Guide the client/organization through the process strongly from the beginning. 
▪ Tell the org what you're going to need before you even start brainstorming 
pretexts. 
▪ Find out on Day 0 who can veto a pretext.  Explain the risk of a late-stage veto. 
▪ Set and remind org of deadlines for pretext acceptance. 
▪ Prototype pretexts: don't build a site until final agreement on pretext. 
▪ Involve the org contact in developing pretexts. 
▪ Realize that you're in a multi-party negotiation and rock it accordingly.

• assigning blame 
== • lamenting failure
"""
14
"""
▪ You spend substantial time developing a pretext e-mail and landing page, but then 
none of your e-mails make it through the organization's spam filters. 
▪ Spam filters trigger because: 
• your domain is too new 
• your domain lacks or has broken SPF/DKIM/MTA configs 
• they get lucky 
▪ Back to the drawing board! The schedule suffers and the org contact is annoyed.
Story 2: SPAM Filters
15
"""
16
"""
▪ On the technical side, configure: 
• SPF 
– make sure to include your IPv6 address 
• DKIM 
• MTA with a domain that has existed for at least a week.  
▪ An even better solution is to explain to your contact that you're testing the 
humans, not the technology, and ask for a spam filter whitelist. 
▪ Make sure to budget time and test the whitelist!

"""
▪ You use all the best tools (including Maltego) and get only 15 e-mail addresses. 
▪ If you want to test the organization as a whole, you need a heck of a lot of e-
mail addresses. 
▪ Black Hats get to: 
• brute force mail servers to find valid e-mail addresses 
• buy mailing lists

▪ Let's stipulate that an attacker could get a very comprehensive list of e-mail addresses. 
▪ RED TEAM TACTICS: White Card event 
▪ Present options to the client: 
• We'll find addresses, include them in the report, but then client gives us a 
comprehensive list of e-mail addresses. 
• We can brute force your mail server with spam. 
• Just give us a complete set of e-mail addresses.

▪ Your e-mail says it's from Robert Smith, the Director of Information Technology.

24
"""
▪ Know your target.   
▪ If you are a third party, ask your client contact about: 
• Where everyone sits 
• How they communicate 
• Their escalation procedure 
– Do they call compliance, help desk, or HR?   
▪ Better still, make your client/boss contact and at least one level of management above her 
part of the pretext brainstorm.  Catch pretext problems early.

26
"""
▪ Your client asks you to send the phishing e-mails slowly, to avoid detection. 
▪ Your victims start to talk.  By the time you've got ten e-mails out, someone has 
alerted the security folks, compliance or the help desk, who send out a mass e-
mail. 
▪ The jig is up!

"""
28
"""
▪ Phishing truly is about speed.  You must rush. 
▪ You’re racing an organization’s ability to communicate and collaborate.   
▪ Make sure your e-mail gives so short a deadline that people rush to take your 
desired action, before: 
• Someone warns them 
• They get a chance to think about whether this is a good idea.

▪ Can you agree to brainstorm domains as a larger group?
Negotiation

phishes they get.

"""
▪ Share with the org about how broken grammar fails to harden the staff against 
phishers who write well.

broken grammar/spelling

▪ You have to lead the phishing project.  Make involving HR, Legal and/or 
Compliance a mandatory part of the test.

where to place your debugger breakpoints.

how to use it.

stagnate. 
▪ Spin up a few mail servers (MTA’s) then write scripts/processes to change the domain names 
around.

time truly creating.

"""
▪ Phishing is all about collaboration, communication and negotiation. 
• If there are 2 people talking, it’s a negotiation. 
▪ Most of the failures we’ve described are failures to think ahead and 
communicate, collaborate and lead with the org. 
▪ Use and spread these stories to persuade, plan and win. 
• If anyone loses a negotiation here, everyone loses.
