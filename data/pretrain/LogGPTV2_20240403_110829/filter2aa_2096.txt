## Introduction
As cybersecurity professionals, we often assume that phishing should be as straightforward for us as it is for malicious actors. The process typically involves:
1. Crafting a convincing email that directs recipients to a website.
2. Building a one-form website to collect credentials.
3. Gaining client approval for the email and website.
4. Sending the email to as many employees as possible.
5. Monitoring the incoming passwords.

Sometimes, this process works seamlessly, with success rates ranging from 10% to 40%. However, it is not always this simple.

## Why Isn't This Simple?

### Success Rates in Excess of 100%
Larry once conducted a phishing campaign where the success rate exceeded 100%. The targeted company had a subset of employees who, upon receiving the phishing email, forwarded it to their colleagues. The email, which claimed that access would be cut off unless passwords were provided, was highly effective. This incident highlighted the importance of testing privilege-separated accounts and the potential for unexpected outcomes.

### Professional Phishing Engagements
A professional phishing engagement aims to "harden" an organization's staff by:
- Increasing individual resilience.
- Training the organization in collaborative detection.

After a few phishing campaigns, employees are more likely to detect and report scams.

### Why Phish?
Many initial attempts at professional phishing can be frustrating. Over the years, we have learned from these experiences and improved our methods. This talk will detail some of the challenges we and others have faced, and provide solutions to avoid them.

### Why This Talk?
This discussion is not about red team phishing, which typically involves minimal targets and stealthy techniques. Instead, we will share eleven real-life stories of failure, each with specific solutions. These stories will cover the essential aspects of setting up a professional phishing campaign, including collaboration, communication, and negotiation.

## Penetration Test Phishing vs. Red Team Phishing
Red team phishing focuses on gaining initial access with a very small target pool, usually just one or two emails. This approach requires:
- Manual target identification.
- Open-source reconnaissance (e.g., LinkedIn, Connect.com, company websites).
- Stealth and a low profile to avoid detection.
- Use of pre-established personas and topical payloads.
- Utilization of whitelisted email services like Gmail or Office365.

## Eleven Stories

### Story 1: Schedule Fail
We presented three scenarios to a client, who chose one. We built the pretext by Wednesday and planned to send the emails on Friday. However, the client showed the URL to his manager on Thursday, who vetoed the entire scenario, disrupting the schedule.

**Fix:**
- Guide the client through the process from the beginning.
- Clearly communicate what you need before brainstorming pretexts.
- Identify key decision-makers and explain the risks of late-stage vetoes.
- Set and remind the organization of deadlines for pretext acceptance.
- Prototype pretexts and involve the client in their development.
- Recognize and manage multi-party negotiations effectively.

### Story 2: SPAM Filters
Despite developing a well-crafted pretext email and landing page, none of the emails made it through the organization's spam filters due to issues such as a new domain, broken SPF/DKIM/MTA configurations, or pure luck.

**Fix:**
- Configure SPF, DKIM, and MTA with a domain that has existed for at least a week.
- Explain to the client that you are testing human behavior, not technology, and request a spam filter whitelist.
- Budget time and test the whitelist.

### Story 3: Numbers Game Fail
Using the best tools, we only obtained 15 email addresses, which is insufficient for testing the entire organization. Malicious actors can brute force mail servers or buy mailing lists.

**Fix:**
- Present options to the client, such as providing a comprehensive list of email addresses, brute-forcing the mail server, or obtaining a complete set of email addresses.

### Story 4: The Open Floor Plan
An email from a high-ranking executive led to immediate detection in an open floor plan office, as employees quickly alerted the executive.

**Fix:**
- Understand the target environment, including seating arrangements and communication practices.
- Involve the client and management in the pretext brainstorming to catch potential issues early.

### Story 5: Low and Slow
The client requested a slow, staggered email delivery to avoid detection, but this allowed victims to alert security, compliance, or the help desk, leading to a mass warning email.

**Fix:**
- Emphasize the importance of speed in phishing.
- Create a sense of urgency in the email to prompt quick action.

### Story 6: Poor Domain Choice
Choosing a domain with a single letter change or omission, even with a valid TLS certificate, led to easy detection by trained employees.

**Fix:**
- Use domain names that include the company's true name.
- Collaborate with the organization and colleagues to select effective domains.

### Story 7: Broken Grammar
The client requested the use of broken grammar and spelling to simulate weak phishes, which lowered the success rate and provided a false sense of security.

**Fix:**
- Educate the client about the ineffectiveness of broken grammar in hardening staff against sophisticated phishers.
- Offer to conduct rounds with both perfect and broken grammar.

### Story 8: The SEC Investigation
The organization did not involve HR, Legal, or Compliance, leading to an SEC investigation after a compliance department call.

**Fix:**
- Make involving HR, Legal, and Compliance a mandatory part of the test.
- Share relevant stories and understand escalation paths.

### Story 9: Success and an Unhappy Client
Despite a successful campaign, the client felt there was insufficient communication, or they called frequently for updates.

**Fix:**
- Provide frequent updates and make the client feel valued.
- Manage expectations and set clear communication schedules.

### Story 10: Re-inventing the Wheel
Each phishing campaign involved creating new infrastructure from scratch, leading to inefficiency and lack of innovation.

**Fix:**
- Use existing free tools and teach everyone how to use them.
- Automate processes to reduce errors and focus on true innovation.

### Story 11: Unknown Impact
Failing to follow up with the right people after the campaign left the impact unknown.

**Fix:**
- Plan how to inform affected staff and focus on proactive improvement.
- Monitor reporting rates, escalation, and alerting improvements.
- Recommend regular self-phishing for the organization.

## Overall Lesson
Phishing is fundamentally about collaboration, communication, and negotiation. Most failures stem from a lack of foresight and effective communication. By sharing and learning from these stories, we can persuade, plan, and succeed. Remember, if anyone loses in a negotiation, everyone loses.
