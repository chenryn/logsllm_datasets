dynamic, dynamic, dynamic, dynamic, BGP, AS number) for the
(router name, interface name, IP address, subnet, protocol, routing
process id) attributes. Finally, we group all BGP routing processes
with the same AS number into a single routing instance.
Given a network, we consider all the static and connected routes
across the routers to form a distinct routing instance. This routing
instance can be redistributed into any routing protocol.
To illustrate our method, we consider the example network de-
picted in Figure 2. Figure 3 highlights the boundaries of the rout-
ing instances for this network, in which the underlying router level
topology is depicted in shade. Router A and router Q have different
AS numbers thus there are two BGP instances in the ﬁgure. Also,
to avoid clutter in the ﬁgure, the routing instance comprising the
static and connected routes is not represented. Figure 4 shows the
routing instances without the routers, and also depicts the intercon-
nections between the routing instances. These edges are further
described in the next section. This example network has multiple
routing instances. Each instance is assigned a globally unique iden-
tiﬁer and the default administrative distance is indicated in brack-
ets. Instances 1 and 2 have default AD values of (20/200). This is
because BGP differentiates external routes (AD=20) from internal
routes (AD=200). Similarly, instance 6 has a default AD value of
(5/90/170) because EIGRP distinguishes 3 types of routes: sum-
mary (AD=5), internal (AD=90) and external (AD=170) routes.
3.2 Identiﬁcation of routing instance intercon-
nections
We propose the following method to study the interconnections
(or route propagation paths) between the routing instances. When
a route redistribution is conﬁgured between two routing processes
(i.e., across the boundaries of two routing instances), we represent
it by a directed edge from the source routing instance into the tar-
get routing instance. The edges are labeled to indicate the router
that is conﬁgured to perform the redistribution. When the default
AD of a routing process is overridden at a router, we add the cus-
tomized AD value of the routing process(es) to the edge. A redis-
tribution from u to v by router R, with customized AD values d1
for u and d2 for v is represented by the label “d1,R,d2”. When a
routing process has multiple AD values at a router (e.g., one per
preﬁx), it is represented by the symbol “+”. For example, in the
graph from Figure 4, the edge from routing instance 3 to routing
instance 5 labelled “105, M” indicates that router M is conﬁgured
to redistribute routes from M.3 to M.5. In addition, the label high-

lights that the AD value of the source routing process has been
customized to 105. Finally, since the AD value of the target rout-
ing process is not indicated, one can derive that router M uses the
default AD value (i.e., 110) for M.5.
We call the resulting graph using our above proposed method
a routing instance interconnection graph. Figure 4 shows such a
graph for the network of Figure 2. The routing instance intercon-
nection graph enables us to highlight several important characteris-
tics of the network.
• Routers M and N have a customized AD value (105) for in-
stance 3. This indicates that routing instance 5 prefers to for-
ward trafﬁc to routing instance 3 instead of routing instance 4
when both offer a route to the same destination.
• Router V is only redistributing routes from routing instance 4
into routing instance 7. Thus, the routing information exchange
is only one-way, from instance 4 to 7. One may infer that routing
instance 7 is hosting a monitoring entity which is only interested
in receiving updates.
• Finally, routing instances 5 and 6 have two redistribution points
that are performing mutual route redistribution. Such conﬁgu-
ration enables load sharing and is more robust to network fail-

ures: in the event of a router or link failure, another router is
still present to connect the two routing instances. However, such
conﬁguration can result in routing anomalies [10]. A closer look
at the policies is needed to verify whether adequate means are
implemented to prevent instabilities. Similarly, the graph high-
lights that routes are redistributed between BGP and IGPs at
two interconnection points (B, S) potentially resulting in rout-
ing anomalies.
While a network may comprise a large number of routers, the
routing instance interconnection graph exposes the most important
routers to look at when analyzing the interactions between routing
instances. The graph is particularly valuable for large networks. As
will be shown later, some of the operational networks in our dataset
consist of hundreds or even thousands of routers.
3.3 Impact of incomplete conﬁgurations
As will be shown in Section 4, for a fraction of the networks
we do not have all the conﬁguration ﬁles. In such networks, our
methodology can overestimate the number of routing instances. To
illustrate this point, we focus on routers N, W , Y , Z, X and L
in Figure 3. These six routers belong to the same EIGRP routing
instance. Now, we assume that the conﬁguration ﬁle for router W
is missing. In this case, router N would appear to be disconnected
from the other routers2 and therefore N seems to belong to a dif-
ferent EIGRP routing instance than routers Y , Z, X and L.
4. DATASET
The data we analyzed consists of the router conﬁguration ﬁles
from more than 1600 networks. All the corresponding routers are
Cisco routers and the networks are from three different types: en-
terprise, university campus and tier-1 service provider.
Figure 5 depicts the size distribution of the networks. 52% of
the networks have three or fewer routers. This can in part be ex-
plained by the fact that a portion of the data is obtained from a
tier-1 ISP that manages enterprise networks as part of its offered
services. As such, a fraction of the networks does not present the
complete conﬁgurations from all the routers but instead consists of
only the conﬁgurations from the routers located at customer sites
but managed by the ISP. Despite being incomplete, these conﬁgu-
rations were still valuable given the focus of this study: we were
able to use them to analyze the interconnections between the cus-
tomer networks and their provider ISP.
Figure 6 describes the size distribution of the conﬁguration ﬁles.
The average conﬁguration ﬁle size is 675 lines. The graph shows

Yet, a small number of routers present signiﬁcantly larger conﬁgu-
rations, each of which contains more than 9000 command lines.
5. PREVALENCE OF ROUTE REDISTRI-
BUTION
We ﬁrst apply the previously described algorithm to identify the
routing instances in each network. Then, we look at the redistri-
butions between these routing instances. Noting that route selec-
tion and route redistribution are widely used, we more closely look
at the redistributions to understand whether routes are exchanged
from an IGP into BGP, from BGP into an IGP or directly between
IGPs. This high level classiﬁcation provides some ideas on how op-
erators use route selection and route redistribution. The subsequent
section will further delve into this question.
Figure 7 represents the distribution of the networks in terms of
routing instances. Every network has a routing instance corre-
sponding to the connected and static routes. In addition, networks
typically run one or multiple routing protocol instances (e.g., EIGRP,
BGP, OSPF, RIP). We observe that 46% of the networks have only
two routing instances (one of them being the routing instance cor-
responding to the connected and static routes.) These networks
mainly consist of customers where only the conﬁgurations from the
customer-premise equipments (CE routers) were available. These
routers are running an instance of BGP to advertise the customer’s
routes into the provider network. The customer site might be a
small one which has one router, or it might running its own IGP
and pointing to the border router for the default route. Unfortu-
nately, we do not have access to the remaining conﬁguration ﬁles,
if any. On the other hand, we note that about 10% of the networks
have 10 or more routing instances, and some networks can even
have more than 400 routing instances. Most of these networks cor-
