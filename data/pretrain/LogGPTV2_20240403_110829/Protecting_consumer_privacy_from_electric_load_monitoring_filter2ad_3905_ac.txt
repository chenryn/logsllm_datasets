state can be maintained. Following several high amplitude loads at
the beginning of the trace, the steady state converges to durations
of half a day or more by Apr. 22nd.
A number of large features appear in u outside of the steady state.
These features tend to appear at the peaks of comparatively steady
high-amplitude loads. Examples of such events occur on Apr. 18th
and 28th. These features, which are also some of the largest in d,
either cause or occur during low recovery state. When the battery is
recharging, the target load KL is set to allow the maximum rate of
charge, causing the large yet steady load below the visible features.

After sustained periods of steady state operation or light loads in
d, a sharp decrease will occur in u as NILL enters a high recovery
state. This happens when the battery has reached full charge while
maintaining KSS. In this state, the target load KH is chosen to be
just below some of the recently sampled demand values, so as to
allow the battery to discharge at a low rate. As can be seen, in the
majority of cases, the choice of KH is correct on the ﬁrst try. On a
few occasions, most notably after mid day on Apr. 18th, the initial
guess is too high, and KH is lowered by 0.6 kW to allow the battery
to discharge. In several instances (such as just prior to Apr. 26th)
the NILL controller chose KH to be slightly below zero, meaning
that the battery is effectively discharging to the grid. This is only a
concern if the meter can detect reverse power ﬂows, in which case
the NILL system can be conﬁgured to never set KL below zero.
Having now covered how NILL reacts to loads, it should not
be surprising that on the larger scale of days to weeks, the NILL
graph looks similar to the original load. This is result of both the
limited capacity batteries afforded by current technology, and typ-
ical weather and occupant behavioral patterns. While these larger
trends reveal information about customers, most notably the likeli-
hood of human presence in the house, they do not reveal the more
ﬁne-grained details such as how many occupants are at home or
what their activities are. Thus, we now turn our analysis to quan-
tifying NILL’s effectiveness in removing individual appliance fea-
tures from load proﬁles.
4.4 Countering NILM
NILM algorithms exploit the amplitude changes in load pro-
ﬁles. These “features” are indicative appliance ON/OFF events
(and appliance-internal state changes that effect energy consump-
tion, e.g., washing machine cycles [3]). Features exploited by NILM
are represented by (time, amplitude). Here, amplitude is not the
absolute metric of energy, but the relative change in energy use
from the last sample. For example, a system exhibiting a 5-second
load proﬁle: {t0 : 0W, t1 : 100W, t2 : 200W, t3 : 200W, t4 :
200W, t5 : 100W} would yield features: {(t1, +100W), (t2, +
100W), (t3, 0W), (t4, 0W), (t5,−100W)}. Samples with ampli-
tude with no change are not features, and are ignored for analysis.
Table 3 shows the feature reduction for the simulated environ-
ments. The original TED proﬁle data (Non-NILL) contains just
over 1 million features on the 60 day proﬁle of the large house
H1, down to the 380 thousand features in the 29 day proﬁle for the
small townhouse T1. When the load proﬁle is simulated in NILL-
enabled residences (NILL), the number of features drops signiﬁ-
cantly (around 95% or more). This reduces the number of features
from several hundred an hour to as few as 16 in the case of T1.
A key question asks if the residual features left after NILL are
useful for the NILM analysis. Recall from Section 2 that NILM rely
on pairs of symmetric ON/OFF “sister” features to infer appliance
usage. We performed a sister matching algorithm that would match
all events of greater than 10 W –about 1/6th the draw of a light
bulb–as a pairing of positive charge increase and decrease (with a
tolerance of 5 W). The matching algorithm linearly scans forward
in the trace for the equal and opposite OFF event for each ON event.
Table 3 shows that each simulated environment experienced 94% or
greater reduction in identiﬁable sister features.
Raw feature reduction sketches the aggregate behavior of NILL,
but only provides a crude estimate of privacy-preservation over
time. A feature mass (F M (w, D)) is the number of non-zero fea-
tures from over a discrete sample set D = (d0, d1, . . . , dw), e.g.,
the number of features over a given time window of size w. In this
work, the feature mass is the number of non-zero energy transitions
occurring within a time-series interval sample D of length w:
wP
F M (w, D) =
(di (cid:54)= 0)
The relative feature mass (RFM) for an interval w is the ratio of the
feature mass for two sample sets (in this case NILL over non-NILL)
over w, e.g.:
i=0
RF M (w, D) = F M (w,DN ILL)
F M (w,DN ON_N ILL)
RFM measures the relative number of features of the original and
NILL data. Intuitively, as RFM approaches zero, there is very little
signal relative to the original proﬁle for a NILM algorithm to oper-
ate on. Figure 8 shows the RFM computed at ten minute intervals
with a one hour sliding window, i.e., w = 1 hour, over two days
at A1 (11 days into the trace) and H1 (29 days into the trace).
The most visible characteristic in Figure 8 is the oscillation of
RFM. Most of the trace shows the RFM at 1% or less, and at zero
for some of the time (note that the Y axis is on a log scale). The
reason for this is the nature of the battery system. When the battery
is in the low recovery state, it is unable to suppress most appliance
features, and they become visible in the load proﬁle. (We investi-
gate the impact of features occurring during low recovery state in
the next section). RFM increases in this off state, peaking in the
case of H1 at almost 0.5 RFM for a few minutes. T1 has fewer and
less pronounced increases in RFM. Note that the prolonged RFM
of zero represents perfect privacy.
To get a sense for the behavior of steady state NILL, consider
the normal steady state. We arbitrarily deﬁne the system to be in
a NILL-effective state when the RFM is less than 0.1–which repre-

sents 10% residual features resulting from NILL. Table 4 shows
the features present during intervals when the system is NILL-
effective.
In all experiments the features, features per hour, and
sister features are reduced by over 99%. Table 5 shows that this
state is the norm–where between 65% to over 85% of the simulated
time was in this state in the simulated environment. One might
(incorrectly) attribute the success of in these instances to periods
when the load is quiescent. Quite the contrary, the majority of total
features in the original data are present during these periods. 83%
of the original features for H1 are observed during a NILL effective
state, 78.5% of H2, 82% of A1, and 90% of T1.
Figure 9 shows RFM as a CDF–the Y-axis indicates the simu-
lated time in which the system encounters a RFM (X-axis) or less.
For all traces the feature mass is zero for 65% to over 80% of the
time. Trace time rises steadily until around an RFM of 50%, which
is around 2% of the trace for all simulated environments.
4.5 Residual Features
A residual feature is any feature that appears in the original pro-
ﬁle that also appears in the NILL trace, e.g., an energy transition
that appears at (or about) the same time with similar amplitude
(within few watts). Because they precisely reﬂect appliance activ-
ities, these are the only features that are of value to current NILM
algorithms. Such features slip through the NILL control system
and are observable by the adversary. Table 6 shows the residual
features occurring in the simulated environments.
One reason for the presence of residual features is the low re-
covery state, hereafter called simply low state for brevity, during
which the battery is recharging. Table 7 describes NILL behavior
