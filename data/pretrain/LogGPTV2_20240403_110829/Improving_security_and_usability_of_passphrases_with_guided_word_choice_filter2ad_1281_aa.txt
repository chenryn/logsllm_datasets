Improving security and usability of passphrases with guided
word choice
Nikola K. Blanchard, Clément Malaingre, Ted Selker
ABSTRACT
Passphrases have many uses, such as serving as seeds for passwords.
User-created passphrases are easier to remember, but tend to be
less secure than ones created from words randomly chosen in a
dictionary. This paper develops a way of making more memorable,
more secure passphrases. It investigates the security and usability
of creating a passphrase by choosing from a randomly generated set
of words presented as an array. A usability experiment shows that
participants using this method are weakly affected by the word’s
position in the array, and more importantly by word familiarity.
Passphrases chosen from randomly generated lists achieved 97% to
99% of the maximal entropy in randomly generated passphrases and
caused less than half of the memory mistakes. Prompting a person
with random words from a large dictionary is an effective way of
helping them make a more memorable high-entropy passphrase.

1 INTRODUCTION
It is hard to make high entropy (highly random) codes, and it is hard
to remember them. Typical uses of passwords have suffered from
serious usability and security problems [Cranor 2014, 2016]. Low-
entropy selection methods, poor memorability, and rules that make
passwords difficult to retrieve all reduce their utility. Biometric
methods are promising, but they still suffer from many vulnerabili-
ties, typically being hacked within six months of introduction [Cao
and Jain 2016; Reddy et al. 2008; Ruiz-Albacete et al. 2008; Smith
et al. 2015]. Biometric security approaches also have an increased
risk of unmitigatable leaks about a particular user [Simoens et al.
2009] (as a retina is harder to change than a password). As well as

the typical HCI research, the usability of systems is deeply effected
by our access problems.
Systems have a critical need for security alternatives that can
handle sharing and changing the access method (such as giving
a database password to someone for the evening). Longer lists
of words – or passphrases – have been suggested as a possible
solution for improving security [Shay et al. 2014; Topkara et al.
2007]. Although they were introduced as early as 1982 [Porter
1982], dozens of years later passphrases still suffer from problems
similar to the ones passwords have.
Passphrases have been shown to typically be made from inse-
cure, linguistically easy-to-crack patterns [Kuo et al. 2006], like
song lyrics or famous quotes. A significant number of passphrases
created by the Amazon PayPhrase system were easily hackable,
with 1.3 percent of accounts being vulnerable to a 20,000-word
dictionary of terms used in popular culture [Bonneau 2012; Bon-
neau and Shutova 2012]. In another study [Yang et al. 2016], one
passphrase method led 2.55% of users to choose the same sentence.
Despite multiple protocols encouraging users to make personalized
sentences, five out of six methods had many occurrences of different
users ending up with the same passphrase. With the single method
that had no two users choose the same password, they still observed
some quotes and famous sentences, but few enough not to have
collisions on a database of only 777 passwords. These studies show
that letting people choose a passphrase with no constraints leads
to low-entropy passphrases, even when giving them instructions
to make personalized passphrases.
For passphrases to be useful, they need to have high entropy. To
achieve this, they have to be not only longer but, more importantly,
less predictable. High-entropy passphrases can then be useful for
many purposes, such as seeding diverse passwords [Blocki et al.
2014] or creating other codes. As opposed to complex passwords
which are hard to remember [Komanduri et al. 2011; Pilar et al.
2012; Yan et al. 2004], passphrases benefit directly from our natural
abilities to remember sequences of words [Baddeley and Hitch
1974; Miller 1956]. They can then serve as a high-entropy source
for methods which avoid the pitfalls of password reuse [Lipa 2016;
Segreti et al. 2017; Wash et al. 2016].
To avoid users choosing common passphrases, one could take
inspiration from standard password practice and draw words uni-
formly from a dictionary. However, this has two drawbacks: first,
the passphrases generated are not individualized and can suffer
from low memorability. Second, to make sure that the user knows
all the words generated, the dictionary from which the words are
drawn must be of limited size.
This paper explores a method of guiding the user to choose
their passphrase from an imposed set of random words. A usabil-
ity experiment explores the factors affecting the word choice, the
participants’ ability to remember their passphrases, and the type
of mistakes they make. Both for primary and secondary English
speakers, this method leads to highly increased memorability of
Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

the passphrases created. Moreover, since the user can choose from
several words, the dictionary need not be made of only words that
are sure to be known to a user, allowing the use of much bigger
dictionaries, leading to an increase not only in usability but also in
security.
2 METHOD
An online usability experiment explored the impact of creating a
passphrase by choosing words from an array.
2.1 Word choice
Presented guide words were drawn uniformly (each word having
the same probability) from a dictionary crafted for this purpose.
This dictionary is based on the first third of Peter Norvig’s 300000
most frequent n-grams [Norvig 2009]. As those 100000 words still in-
cluded words from other languages such as "unglaublichen" as well
as some non-words like "unixcompile", only ones which were also
in the SOWPODS (list of admissible words in English Scrabble tour-
nament) were kept. This created a list of the 87691 most frequent
English words. Thanks to shared roots in words, there is evidence
that most people would know a large majority of them [Brysbaert
et al. 2016; Hartmann 1946]. As the participants chose only 6 words
from the array, having a few unknown words in it did not change
the process or outcome.
To get a variety of behaviours, we experimented with word
arrays of different sizes. To give participants a real choice, the
guide array to choose from was created to be several times the
length of the passphrase created from it. It also needed to not be
so long that people got confused or took too much time making
decisions. An array of size 100 was the biggest that could reliably
fit on a computer screen, and 20 was the smallest that guaranteed
enough possibilities for the user to choose from (38760 in total,
discouting order). Both the 20 and 100 word arrays tested were
also big enough to ensure that the participants could choose from
a sufficient number of words they knew.
2.2 Protocol
The experiment was hosted on a privately hosted server and ac-
cessed remotely over the web. It ran on the Scala Play framework
and a PostgreSQL database. Participants were shown the following
pages, with instructions at the top of each:
(1) A welcome page that gave participants an overview of the
activity and informed them of their rights.
(2) A question asking their age and another asking the main
language they used in everyday life.
(3) A dynamically generated array of either 20 or 100 words (A/B
testing) presented in five columns of either 4 or 20 words.
Participants were told to select 6 words, in the order of their
choice, and input them in the 6 text-boxes at the bottom of
the page.
A control experiment was run to create a baseline for re-
membering a 6-word passphrase. Instead of choosing their
words from an array, a sequence of 6 randomly generated
words was directly given, while informing them that it had
been randomly created.
(4) A page that repeated the passphrase, then prompted partici-
pants to repeat it to themselves until they could remember
it.
(5) A text-box was presented with instructions to type in the
first two letters of each of their words.
(6) A page was presented, showing an array of words that had
previously been presented to another participant. They were
then told to try guessing what words the other participant
had chosen.
(7) A page informing them which if any of their guessed words
were correct, and telling them that they could try to guess
more passphrases if they wanted, or could continue with the
rest of the experiment.
(8) A page asking them to repeat all six words from their passphrase
in the same order, or as many as they could think of if they
didn’t remember all of them. If some were missed, they were
then presented with their original array of words as a clue
and asked to find all six of them .
(9) A page thanking them for their participation and inviting
them to encourage others to become participants.
The experiment collected of the following data for analysis:
• Any information entered in the text-boxes.
• All the words and arrays shown to the participants.
• Time spent on each page.
• List of (keystroke/timestamp) couples.
To make sure that no one would try the experiment multiple times
to improve their performance, IP addresses associated with the par-
ticipants were temporarily kept. A single occurrence of a second try
by a participant was detected and was excluded from the database.
2.3 Design choices
Passphrases of length 6 were chosen as they provide the entropy
required in previous work on password generation from passwords.
Moreover, this is compatible with known bounds on memory and
information processing ability [Miller 1956].
The guide array was purposely designed not to line up with the
spaces for words in the passphrase below (as shown on Figure 1) to
avoid confusion in step 3 and separate the guide words from the
user-chosen passphrase. Participants were also told to try to make
their passphrase memorable, for example, by creating a phrase,
rhyme, or sentence from their selected words.
Step 5 was meant to help learn the passphrase and check whether
it was memorized. Step 6 was then introduced as a distractor ex-
ercise introduced to interfere with their short term memory for
passphrases. The idea was to eliminate short term memory of
their initial passphrase by making them think of someone else’s
passphrase.
3 DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
3.1 Participant selection
The principles of informed consent (including right to quit and
right to privacy), not using people in protected classes, beneficence,
justice and minimal deception were followed. All the participants
were volunteers, and were informed of the length of experiment and
that they could quit at any point. They were told that it was an op-
portunity to help them test their memory and for us to understand
