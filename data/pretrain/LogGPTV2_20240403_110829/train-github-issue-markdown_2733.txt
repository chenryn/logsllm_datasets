Hi,
Using **v0.191** installed on _Linux_ with this command `script/grunt install
--install-dir ~/.local`.
Steps to reproduce:
  * Type following in a shell
    $ touch /tmp/hihi
    $ atom /tmp &
  * Right click on `hihi`
  * Select _Delete_
**Result:** File is still on disk.  
**Expected:** File removed.
Thanks for the fine work.
