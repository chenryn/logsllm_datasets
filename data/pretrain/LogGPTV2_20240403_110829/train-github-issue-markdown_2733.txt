Subject: Issue with File Deletion in Atom v0.191 on Linux

Hi,

I am using **Atom v0.191** installed on _Linux_ with the following command:
```sh
script/grunt install --install-dir ~/.local
```

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:
   ```sh
   touch /tmp/hihi
   atom /tmp &
   ```
2. Right-click on the `hihi` file.
3. Select _Delete_ from the context menu.

### Result:
- The file `hihi` remains on the disk.

### Expected:
- The file `hihi` should be removed from the disk.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Best regards,
KÃ©vin
