Aggregation per day. We observed in Section 5 that, while it
is o(cid:137)en possible to detect Alexa Enabled devices within an hour,

the same is not always true for Samsung IoT devices. (cid:140)erefore,
Figure 11(b) reports the same data but this time using an aggrega-
tion period of a day.3 We see that the total number of observed
subscriber lines does not change drastically from day to day. How-
ever, we also note that the number of subscriber lines with Alexa
Enabled devices roughly doubled, while those with Samsung in-
creased by a factor of 6. (cid:140)e reason is that detecting Samsung
IoT devices is more challenging because they are contacting their
Primary domain less frequently than Alexa Enabled devices. (cid:140)us,
their detection is heavily helped by the increase in the observation
time period. For the other IoT devices we see these e(cid:130)ects, whereby
the increase is correlated to the expected time for detection. Note,
certain Samsung domains are contacted by both Samsung IoT and
Non-IoT devices. In our analysis, we only consider domains that
are exclusively contacted by Samsung IoT devices. By adding those
domains, the number of detected Samsung devices will be increased
at least by a factor of two, but this also adds false positives to our
results.
Detecting speci(cid:128)c devices. So far, we have focused on the su-
perclass of Alexa Enabled and Samsung IoT devices. However, by
adding more specialized features, our methodology allows us to
further di(cid:130)erentiate them. For example, some subsets of domains
are only contacted by speci(cid:128)c products. (cid:140)us, in Figure 12 we
show which fraction of the Alexa Enabled IoT devices are con-
(cid:128)rmed Amazon products and which fraction of these are Fire TVs
using a conservative detection threshold of 0.4. For Samsung IoT
devices, we show how many of them are Samsung TVs. Again, the
3Most subscriber lines are not subject to new address assignments within a day. Most
addresses remain stable as the ISP o(cid:130)ers VoIP services.

Subscriber lines churn. While the ISP’s overall churn of sub-
scriber line identi(cid:128)er is pre(cid:138)y low (as was also con(cid:128)rmed by the
ISP operator), some changes are possible and may bias our results.
Possible reasons for such changes are: unplugging/rebooting of the
home router, regional outages, or daily re-assignment of IPs for
privacy reasons. Yet, as most IoT devices are detectable within a
day (recall Section 5), the churn should not bias our results. Still, to
check for such artifacts, we move to larger time windows: see the
upper panel of Figure 13, which plots the cumulative number of sub-
scriber lines with detected Alexa Enabled and Samsung IoT devices,
respectively, for up to two weeks. Here, we see that the fractions
increase. However, we may have substantial double counting due
to identi(cid:128)er rotation. To underline this conclusion, we consider
penetration at the /24 pre(cid:128)x aggregation level, see the lower panel
in Figure 13. (cid:140)e penetration lines stabilize smoothly, but at dif-
ferent levels and with di(cid:130)erent speed. (cid:140)e la(cid:138)er is related to the
popularity of an IoT device. If it is already popular, the likelihood
of moving from a known to an unknown subscriber line identi(cid:128)er
is lower with respect to less popular IoT devices.
Detecting other IoT devices in-the-wild. Figure 14 reports the
detected number of the IoT devices that are neither Alexa Enabled
nor Samsung IoT. We report them using a heatmap, where each
column corresponds to a day and each row to an IoT device anno-
tated with its detection level. (cid:140)e color of each entry shows the
number of subscribers lines during that day. Our (cid:128)rst observation
is that the number of subscriber lines for each device class is very
stable across the duration of our study. Next, we point out that
our experiments include popular devices from both the European
as well as the US market. For a reference, we report the relative
popularity of each IoT device in the Amazon ranking for that de-
vice, in the country where the ISP operates. If a ranking of a device
is not available, we categorize them as “other.” Popular devices
are more prominent than unpopular ones or the ones that are not
available in the country’s market. For example, on the one hand
there are Philips devices that are popular and in heavy use with
more than 100 K subscription lines on a daily basis. On the other
hand there is Microseven camera that is not in the country’s market.
Yet, we can still observe some deployments, these results highlight

that our methodology is able to detect both popular and unpopular
IoT devices when the domains and associated service IPs that IoT
devices visit can be extracted.
6.3 Vantage Point: IXP
Next, we apply our detection methodology at the IXP vantage
point. Here, we have to tackle a few additional challenges: First,
the sampling rate at the IXP is an order of magnitude lower than at
the ISP. Second, the vantage point is in the middle of the network,
which means that we have to deal with routing asymmetry and
partial visibility of the routes. (cid:140)ird, while the ISP does aggressive
spoo(cid:128)ng prevention, e.g., with reverse path (cid:128)ltering, this is not
possible at the IXP. Spoo(cid:128)ng prevention is the responsibility of
individual IXP members. (cid:140)us, we require TCP tra(cid:129)c to see at
least one packet without (cid:131)ags, indicating that a TCP connection
was successfully established. While this may reduce visibility, it
prevents us from over-estimating the presence of IoT tra(cid:129)c.
While the IXP o(cid:130)ers network connectivity for every ASes, only
a few member ASes are large eyeballs [30]. It is not that surprising
that we did not observe any activity of the ground truth experi-
ment, recall Section 3. Still, we are able to detect signi(cid:128)cant IoT
activity. Figure 15 shows the number of IPs for which we detected
IoT activity per day for our two-week study period (November
15th-28th, 2019). We are able to detect roughly 90k Samsung de-
vices, 200k Alexa Enabled devices, and more than 100k of other IoT
devices. (cid:140)is underlines that our methodology, which is based on
domains and generalized observations from a single subscriber line,
is successful. Most IXP members are non-eyeball networks. As
such, we expect that the detected IoT activity is concentrated on
these members. Figure 16 shows an ECDF of the distribution of IoT
activity per AS for one day (November 15th, 2019) and three IoT
device types, namely, Samsung IoT, Alexa Enabled, and the other
IoT devices. (cid:140)e distributions are all skewed—a small number of
member ASes are responsible for a large fraction of the IoT activity.
Manual checks showed that these are all eyeball ASes. Yet, we also
see a fairly long tail. (cid:140)is underlines that some IoT devices may not
only be used at home (and, thus, send their tra(cid:129)c via a non-eyeball
AS).

7 DISCUSSION
7.1 Device Usage Detection
A natural question is whether sampled (cid:131)ow data also allows one
to distinguish if an IoT device is in active use. Our results indicate
that the answer is positive. First, our ground truth experiments
show that for some devices, the domain sets used during the idle
experiments di(cid:130)er from those during active experiments. Hence we
can use these domains to determine the mode (active/idle) of an IoT
device. Second, the amount of tra(cid:129)c also varies depending on the
mode. To highlight this, Figure 17 shows the number of observed
packets at the Home-VP for a single Alexa Enabled device, as well
as the ISP-VP for both modes. Activities cause spikes above 1K at
the home vantage points and above 10 at the ISP-VP. (cid:140)ese ranges
are never reached during the idle experiments.
When using the (cid:128)rst insight for, e.g., devices from TP-link (TP-
link Dev.), we are able to capture active use for only 3.5% of the
devices. (cid:140)e reason is that these are plugs, which have a total tra(cid:129)c
volume so low that it limits the detectability due to the low sampling
rate at the ISP. When using the second insight for Alexa Enabled
devices, we (cid:128)nd that we can detect signi(cid:128)cant activity. Figure 18
shows both the subscriber lines with Alexa-enabled devices per
hour, per day as well as the subscriber lines with active Alexa-
enabled devices. Based on the above-mentioned observations, we
used the threshold of 10 for packet counts per hour to (cid:128)lter out
subscribers that actively used Alexa-enabled devices in a given hour.
Based on this threshold, we see that the number of actively used
devices reaches 27,000 during the day and weekends (November
23rd-24th, 2019), following the diurnal pa(cid:138)ern of human activity.
(cid:140)e ability to distinguish active from idle usage of IoT devices in
the wild may raise ethical/privacy concerns. However, the goal of
this paper is not to analyze user behavior, but rather to point out
the privacy concerns associated with having these IoT devices at
home [3].
7.2 Potential Security Bene(cid:128)ts
(cid:140)e ability to detect IoT services can be used in a constructive
manner or even as a service by ISPs. For example, if there are
known security problems with an IoT device, the ISP/IXP can block
access to certain domains/IP ranges or redirect their tra(cid:129)c to benign
servers. (cid:140)e methodology can also be used for troubleshooting,
incident investigation, and even incident resolution. For example,
an ISP can use our methodology for redirecting the IoT devices
12
Figure 18: ISP: # Subscribers with active Alexa Enabled/hour.
tra(cid:129)c to a new backend infrastructure that o(cid:130)ers privacy notices or
security patches for devices that are no longer supported by their
manufacturers.
Moreover, if an IoT device is misbehaving, e.g., if it is involved
in network a(cid:138)acks or part of a botnet [31], our methodology can
help the ISP/IXP in identifying what devices are common among
the subscriber lines with suspicious tra(cid:129)c. Once identi(cid:128)ed, their
owner can be noti(cid:128)ed in a similar manner, as suggested by [32],
and it may be possible to block the a(cid:138)ack or the botnet control
tra(cid:129)c [33].
7.3 Limitations
Our methodology has some limitations.
Sample devices. We need to have sample devices in order to
observe which domains are being contacted.
Superclass detection. We mostly check for false negatives and
limitedly for false positives as we only have tra(cid:129)c samples from a
subset of IoT devices, but not for all possible IoT devices. If an IoT
device relies on a shared backend infrastructure or common IoT
APIs, we only detect the superclass, e.g., at the manufacturer level.
Network activity. We rely on the network activity of IoT devices.
As such, if the tra(cid:129)c volume is very low detectability decreases,
and detection time increases.
Shared infrastructures. We cannot detect IoT services that rely
on shared infrastructures. If the IoT devices change their backend
infrastructure, e.g., a(cid:137)er an update, we may have to update our
detection rules too.
7.4 Lessons Learned
Our analysis could be simpli(cid:128)ed if an ISP/IXP had access to all DNS
queries and responses as they do in [34] and [26]. Even having
a partial list, e.g., from the local DNS resolver of the ISP, could
improve our methodology. Yet, this raises many privacy challenges.
An increasing number of end-users rely on technologies like DNS
over TLS [35], or public DNS resolvers, e.g., Google DNS, OpenDNS,
or Cloud(cid:131)are DNS, rather than the local ISP DNS server [36]. Yet,
this also points to another potential privacy issue—the global data
collection and analysis engines at these DNS operators, which can
identify IoT devices at scale from the recorded DNS logs using our
insights. Capturing DNS data from the network itself would require
deep packet inspection and thus, specialized packet capture, which
is beyond the scope of this paper.

only on the device and its tra(cid:129)c intensity, but also on the tra(cid:129)c
capture sampling rates. (cid:140)e lower this rate, the more time it may
take to detect a speci(cid:128)c IoT device. Moreover, identifying the rele-
vant domains for each IoT device does require sanitization, which
may involve manual work, e.g., studying manuals, device docu-
mentation, vendor web sites, or even programming APIs. Given
that we are unable to identify IoT services if they are using shared
infrastructures (e.g., CDNs), this also points out a good way to hide
IoT services.
7.5 Future Directions
We can use our insights to develop signatures that allow an ISP to
identify households that use speci(cid:128)c IoT services. If such services
are, e.g., subject to security concerns they can use such signatures to
notify the corresponding customer of the potential problem and (cid:128)x.
