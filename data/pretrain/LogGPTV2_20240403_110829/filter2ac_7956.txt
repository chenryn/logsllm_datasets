titleblackhat:us-22 Automatic Protocol Reverse Engineering
Protocol reverse engineering is the process of extracting the specification of a network protocol from a binary code that implements it. Extraction of protocol specification is useful in several security-related contexts, such as finding implementation bugs, determining conformance to a standard, or discovering a botnet's command and control (C&C) protocol.Manual reverse engineering of a protocol can be time-consuming. We present a tool that automatically reverse engineers a protocol directly from the binary. Namely, given a binary sample, the tool automatically extracts the protocol specification, including message formats and protocol state machine! The tool leverages symbolic execution and automata learning algorithms. This is the first tool that extract a protocol’s specification without relying on captures of the protocol’s traffic, with no prior knowledge of message formats and without assuming there is an active remote protocol peer (such as a C&C server).This is a joint work with Prof. Orna Grumberg from the Technion.
