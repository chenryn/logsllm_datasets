### A Comprehensive Analysis of API-Xray: Attacks, Countermeasures, and Limitations

#### Introduction
A perfect malware analysis solution is unattainainable. The ongoing cyber arms race between malware developers and defenders has evolved into an intense tug-of-war. Cybercriminals are highly motivated to circumvent any new defense mechanism, such as API-Xray, once it becomes public. While we do not assume that evading API-Xray is strictly impossible, it can significantly increase the cost and complexity for malware developers. This section discusses potential attacks on API-Xray, our countermeasures, the limitations of API-Xray, and its application to Linux malware.

#### 6.1 Possible Attacks and Countermeasures

**Attacks on BTS Mechanism**
- **Description**: The Branch Trace Store (BTS) mechanism can only be manipulated at the kernel level. Starting with Windows 10 (version 1607), the operating system enforces mandatory driver signing, which means that only drivers signed by the Windows Hardware Dev Center program [13] are loaded.
- **Countermeasure**: This enforcement leaves little room for malware to hack into the OS kernel, thereby mitigating potential attacks on the BTS mechanism.

**Attacks on NX Bit**
- **Description**: Unlike the BTS mechanism, the No-eXecute (NX) bit can be detected and manipulated at the user level. Malware can use APIs like `VirtualQuery` to detect if the NX bit is enabled for DLLs' virtual memory pages and `VirtualProtect` or `VirtualAlloc` to disable it.
- **Countermeasure**: API-Xray's kernel module intercepts these detection and manipulation attempts. For instance, when malware uses `VirtualQuery` to check the NX bit, API-Xray hooks the corresponding native API `ZwQueryVirtualMemory` and modifies the return value to hide the NX bit. Similarly, API-Xray hooks `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwAllocateVirtualMemory` to prevent the NX bit from being disabled. Our evaluations show that API-Xray successfully defeats these attacks (Table 9).

**Statically-Linked Libraries**
- **Description**: If system libraries are statically linked into the malware, API-Xray cannot resolve API names because the malware will not call APIs from the monitored DLLs.
- **Countermeasure**: Static linking is not a preferred method for spreading malware due to incompatibility issues across different Windows versions and the significant increase in binary size, which compromises portability.

**Stolen Function**
- **Description**: In this attack, the entire body of an API is copied to another memory space, bypassing the need to jump to the original API.
- **Countermeasure**: To counter this, we can use the "Execute-no-Read" idea [5] to protect DLL memory pages. When the target API function is copied, our page fault handler monitors it, and we use the API information to reconstruct the import tables.

**Argument-Sensitive Trampoline**
- **Description**: Custom trampoline code can be created to handle specific API arguments, making it more challenging for API-Xray to monitor.
- **Countermeasure**: In such cases, we resort to symbolic execution to explore feasible paths to the target API, although this is more resource-intensive.

**Fake API Calls**
- **Description**: Packers can generate many fake or null API calls before invoking the target API, increasing the overhead for API-Xray.
- **Countermeasure**: Although this attack increases the overhead, it also imposes a significant burden on the packed malware itself. Our experiments (Table 10) show that API-Xray remains resilient even under a high volume of fake API calls.

#### 6.2 Limitations

**Custom DLLs**
- **Issue**: 1.6% of malware samples call APIs from custom DLLs, which API-Xray cannot restore in the absence of these DLLs in the testing environment.
- **Mitigation**: Future work will focus on addressing this limitation.

**OEP Obfuscation**
- **Issue**: 9.5% of unpacked PE files with complete import tables crash at runtime due to OEP obfuscation schemes, which cause generic unpacking tools to miss the real OEP locations.
- **Mitigation**: Addressing OEP obfuscation is a separate challenge, and we plan to tackle it in future work.

#### 6.3 Application to Linux Malware

API-Xray is designed to work on Intel CPUs, and both Windows and Linux provide interfaces to manipulate BTS and NX bit. Linux executable file formats also have similar import table structures. According to Cozzi et al. [21], Linux malware is generally less complex than Windows malware, but if it evolves, API-Xray's techniques can be adapted for Linux malware.

#### 7. Conclusion

API-Xray is the first hardware-assisted solution aimed at bridging the gap in generic binary unpacking by automating import table reconstruction. It complements existing binary unpacking tools by producing standard PE files that can be executed and analyzed independently, simplifying the malware analysis process for security analysts.
