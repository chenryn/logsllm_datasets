User: How can i copy a .exe file through python? I tried to read the file and then write the contents to another but everytime i try to open the file it say ioerror is directory. Any input is appreciated.
EDIT:
ok i've read through the comments and i'll edit my code and see what happens. If i still get an error i'll post my code.
Assistant: Use shutil.copyfile(src, dst) or shutil.copy(src, dst). It may not work in case of files in the C:\Program Files\ as they are protected by administrator rights by default.
