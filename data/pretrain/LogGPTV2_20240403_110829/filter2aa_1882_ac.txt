Picking a vulnerability scanning Tool 
Open source vs Commercial 
• 
Pick one to suit your business requirements 
• 
Consider features 
• 
Look at false positive rates 
• 
Look at reporting and output formats etc. 
• 
Scope of features 
Cloud vs On Premises 
• 
Pick solutions to fit your requirements 
• 
Do you need to test air gapped networks? 
• 
Ensure plugins are up to date 
Interpreting Output 
Asset Categorisation 
• 
The act of grouping assets 
o Organization/Defender View 
o “Pentester” View 
Adjudication 
The act of going through and evaluating the threat those pose to the target organisation. 
False Positives 
When a service is incorrectly identified as being vulnerable when it is in fact, not vulnerable.

Exploits & Payloads 
Exploit 
An exploit is the action/mechanisms to exploit a vulnerability (e.g. Unauthenticated RCE, Path 
Traversal, Code Injection) 
Payload 
A payload is the code that will run on the target e.g. 
• 
Meterpreter 
Staged vs Upstaged Payloads 
A staged payload is small payload which downloads the full payload. 
An untagged payload simply runs following the exploit. 
Cross Compiling Code 
Exploit Modification 
• 
Debugging 
• 
Shell Code creation 
Exploit Chaining 
The act of chaining multiple exploits together. 
Proof of Concepts 
An exploit that is created to highlight and validate a vulnerability and exploit chain.

Network Penetration Testing 
Attacks 
Ethernet & TCP/IP Networks 
• 
Sniffing 
o Network cards including Wireless cards must be in promiscuous mode 
o TPC, IP, ARP, ICMP, IGMP, LDAP, SNMP, SMTP, SMB, FTP DNS DHCP, POP3, IMAP, 
UDP, and HTTP can all be sniffed (any cleartext protocol) 
• 
Eavesdropping 
• 
ARP Poisoning 
o The act or sending our AC address out identifying as the default gateway to route 
traffic through our host 
▪ 
IP forwarding 
▪ 
DNS Poisoning 
▪ 
Ettercap 
• 
TCP Session Hijacking 
o The user/machine must have authenticated before 
o Requires a clear text protocol (e.g. TELNET/RLOGIN) 
o Increasing TCP sequence numbers must be detected and guest (they are pseudo 
random) 
o Signing is not in use (e.g. SMB singing is not ENABLED) 
o ARP Poison 
o Send FIN packets to the target to disconnect the client 
o Requires you to spoof IP and MA 
o Tools include: 
▪ 
Tsight 
▪ 
Juggernaut 
▪ 
Hunt 
• 
Browser Hijacking 
o Cookie Sniffing (ARP Poison and HTTP session theft
