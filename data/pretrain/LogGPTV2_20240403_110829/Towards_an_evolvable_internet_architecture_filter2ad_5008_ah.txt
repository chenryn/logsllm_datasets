discussion of “tussles” in cyberspace [52], while [53] articulates
the need to “take explicit, architected action to preserve the ability
to change, evolve and advance (network) technology”. Of course,
whether our proposal represents the right embodiment of the dis-
cussions in [11, 52, 53] is entirely debatable! We look forward to
such debates in future work and instead present this paper as, at the
very least, offering a concrete on-the-table proposal as a starting
point for future discussions.
The technical framework for evolvability described in Sec-
tion 3.1 has two main components, the use of anycast-based redi-
rection and the construction of, and routing over, multi-provider
virtual networks. RFC 1546 [28] ﬁrst proposed the concept of an
anycast service but does not address its implementation. As men-
tioned, some of our proposals for anycast routing are inspired by,
but somewhat different from, GIA [31], a proposal for scalable IP
anycast by Katabi et al. In recent work, Ballani et al. [54] propose
PIAS, a proxy-based approach to deploying a global anycast ser-
vice. PIAS proposes using a hybrid of native IP anycast (to reach
the proxy service) and overlay routing (to implement anycast be-
tween proxies). While using a service such as PIAS is certainly a
possibility that we intend to explore in the future, we chose not to
for the immediate future due to the current lack of deployment of
a PIAS service and also as it isn’t readily apparent how ISPs might
control the operation of an infrastructure such as PIAS.
Most relevant to our discussion on vN-Bones, is the work on
testbeds such as the MBone and XBone [25, 26, 55]. Our proposal
for vN-Bones, is identical in spirit and differs only in some of our
proposals to automate much of the topology and route construc-
tion. Also relevant here is the large body of work on overlay net-
works [18, 20, 21, 56, 57]. While we could (and do) leverage many
of their ideas, vN-Bones differ from the majority of overlays in
two important aspects: (1) vN-Bones are deployed and operated
by multiple ISPs acting in concert and (2) vN-Bones operate at the
router-level path between two endhosts in a manner that is com-
pletely transparent to the endhosts. These two differences lead to
somewhat different needs and solutions to the problem of routing
on the virtual network.
Not surprisingly, mechanisms similar to some discussed in this
paper can be found in the vast body of work on assisting the de-
ployment of IPv6 [34,58–60]. Our contribution lies in relating such
mechanisms to the question of incentives (speciﬁcally universal ac-
cess) and unifying them into a cohesive and general plan for the
deployment of future IPvN.
Finally, this section would be incomplete without paying tribute
to the vision of active networks [15] whose authors were probably
the ﬁrst to tackle the need to enable innovation within the network
infrastructure. However, as should be clear, our approaches are
diametrically opposite. Active networks advocates new services
being loaded into the infrastructure on demand and allows endhosts
to deﬁne these new services. Instead, we rely on ISPs to deploy
new IP functionality and limit endhosts to choosing between ISP
offerings – a much more limited and hence more tractable approach
to supporting innovation in the network infrastructure.
6. DISCUSSION
The inability to evolve IP, which lies at the very core of the Inter-
net architecture, has long vexed the research community. Overlays,
by either circumventing or undermining the control of ISPs, offer
one solution to evolving today’s architecture. This paper explored
an alternate approach. Rather than achieve evolution by overhaul-
ing the administrative and operational structure of today’s Internet,
we look for what is missing from today’s architecture that would
make evolution by its incumbent operators economically desirable
and technically feasible. A difference, in some sense, between
evolving a network and architecting a network for evolvability.
We set out on our exploration fully expecting to discover that
achieving evolvability would require a dramatic re-architecting
of today’s network, rendering our study into a mostly academic
thought exercise. Instead, we found that our current architecture is
largely evolvable as is. (A testament to the wisdom of the current
architecture!). The one missing piece in the puzzle is widespread
support for a global IP anycast service. This is good news because
global support for anycast need not be a pipe dream; on the contrary
deployment of anycast is well within reach even today.
Thus, we leave this paper with one concrete proposal for action –
that it is worth resurrecting the case for a global IP anycast service.
While our proposed plan for evolvability does not strictly require
global deployment of anycast, it would certainly be assisted by such
deployment. Anycast has been proposed and discussed in the past
but has never achieved signiﬁcant momentum in terms of global
deployment or wide-area evaluation. This was in part because its
target usage was fairly narrow (DNS conﬁguration, server selec-
tion, RP location) and partly because, often, similar functionality
could be achieved through equivalent application-layer solutions
(e.g., Akamai redirection for server selection). This paper has ar-
gued that instead, IP anycast could be just the mechanism needed
to evolve the Internet.
Finally, we point out that even though our discussion in this
paper caters to ISPs and their retaining control over the Internet,
it also lays the seeds for new entrants to enter the ﬁeld as pro-
posed in [1].
In particular, ISPs might choose to sell their will-
ingness to route anycast to the third-party Next Generation Service
Providers (NGSPs) proposed in [1]. NGSPs can then deploy their
boxes in various ISP domains and use our framework for evolv-
ability to stitch these together into a single global provider of a
next-generation service. In fact, such an architecture would free
NGSPs from having to deploy the client-side proxies that are oth-
erwise needed to connect endhosts to the NGSP network.
