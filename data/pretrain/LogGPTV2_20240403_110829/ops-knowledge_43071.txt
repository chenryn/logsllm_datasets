User: I have the temperature coming from my arduino through the serial port on my mac. I need to write the data to a file, i don't want my script to write the data from /dev/tty.usbserial-A5025XZE (serial port) if the data is the same or if it is nothing. The temperature is the the format "12.32" and is sent every 5s.
Assistant: Just save the output from the arduino to a temporary variable and compare it to another that is the last value written to a file. If it is different, change the last value written to the new temperature and write it to the file.
