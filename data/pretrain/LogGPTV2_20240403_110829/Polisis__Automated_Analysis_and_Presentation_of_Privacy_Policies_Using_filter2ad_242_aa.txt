## Abstract
Privacy policies are the primary means through which companies inform users about their data collection and sharing practices. However, these policies are often lengthy and difficult to understand. Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have been shown to be useful but face significant scalability challenges due to the number of policies and their frequent updates. Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable tools to manage the breadth and depth of privacy policies.

To address these challenges, we propose an automated framework for privacy policy analysis called Polisis. This framework enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on natural language privacy policies. At its core, Polisis uses a privacy-centric language model built with 130,000 privacy policies and a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers that account for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of privacy practices.

We demonstrate the modularity and utility of Polisis with two applications: 
1. **Structured Querying**: Automatically assigning privacy icons from privacy policies, achieving an accuracy of 88.4%.
2. **Free-Form Querying**: PriBot, the first free-form question-answering system for privacy policies, which can produce a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions. An MTurk user study with 700 participants showed that at least one of PriBot’s top-3 answers is relevant to users for 89% of the test questions.

## 1. Introduction
Privacy policies are a common way to provide notice and choice online, informing users about how companies collect, store, and manage their personal information. Despite some improvements in comprehensibility and readability, privacy policies remain excessively long and difficult to follow. In 2008, McDonald and Cranor estimated that it would take an average user 201 hours to read all the privacy policies encountered in a year. Since then, the proliferation of services and associated policies, along with new forms of user interfaces (e.g., voice-controlled devices, wearables), has made existing techniques for presenting privacy policies less suitable.

### Problem Description
Users, researchers, and regulators struggle to process or understand the content of privacy policies, especially at scale. Users are often surprised by data practices hidden in long, vague, and ambiguous policies. Researchers use expert annotators to analyze a subset of available privacy policies, while regulators rely on companies to self-certify their compliance with privacy practices. The lack of usable and scalable tools to handle the breadth and depth of privacy policies is a significant challenge.

Several proposals have aimed at alternative methods and UIs for presenting privacy notices, including machine-readable formats, nutrition labels, privacy icons, and short notices. However, these approaches face a significant scalability hurdle: the human effort needed to retrofit new notices to existing policies and maintain them over time is substantial. Existing research towards automating this process has been limited in scope.

### Our Framework
We overcome the scalability hurdle by proposing an automatic and comprehensive framework for privacy policy analysis, Polisis. It divides a privacy policy into smaller, self-contained segments and automatically annotates each segment with a set of labels describing its data practices. Unlike prior research, Polisis annotates the privacy policy at a much finer-grained scale, predicting for each segment the set of classes that account for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of embedded privacy information. This enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on privacy policies.

At the core of Polisis is a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers involving 10 high-level and 122 fine-grained privacy classes for privacy-policy segments. We leverage techniques such as subword embeddings and multi-label classification, and seed these classifiers with a custom, privacy-specific language model generated using a corpus of more than 130,000 privacy policies from websites and mobile apps.

Polisis provides the underlying intelligence for researchers and regulators to design a set of queries that power their applications. It does not replace the privacy policy as a legal document but decouples the legally binding functionality from its informational utility.

### Applications
We demonstrate and evaluate the modularity and utility of Polisis with two robust applications:
1. **Structured Querying**: Extracting short notices in the form of privacy icons from privacy policies. We show a solution that can automatically select appropriate privacy icons from a privacy policy, and we empirically demonstrate that existing privacy-compliance companies might adopt permissive policies when assigning such privacy icons.
2. **Free-Form Querying**: Designing, implementing, and evaluating PriBot, the first automated Question-Answering (QA) system for privacy policies. PriBot extracts the relevant privacy policy segments to answer the user’s free-form questions, demonstrating a more intuitive and user-friendly way to present privacy notices and controls.

### Contributions
- **Design and Implementation**: We design and implement Polisis, an approach for automatically annotating previously unseen privacy policies with high-level and fine-grained labels from a pre-specified taxonomy.
- **Accuracy in Assigning Privacy Icons**: We demonstrate how Polisis can assign privacy icons to a privacy policy with an average accuracy of 88.4%, computed by comparing icons assigned with Polisis’ automatic labels to those assigned based on manual annotations by three legal experts.
- **PriBot QA System**: We design, implement, and evaluate PriBot, a QA system that answers free-form user questions from privacy policies. Our evaluation shows that PriBot produces at least one correct answer in its top three for 82% of the test questions and as the top one for 68% of the test questions. An MTurk user study with 700 participants found that users find a relevant answer in PriBot’s top-3 for 89% of the questions.
- **Public Availability**: We make Polisis publicly available by providing three web services: a service giving a visual overview of the different aspects of each privacy policy, a chatbot for answering user questions in real time, and a privacy-labels interface for privacy policies. These services are available at [https://pribot.org](https://pribot.org).

## 2. Framework Overview
Figure 1 shows a high-level overview of Polisis, comprising three layers: Application Layer, Data Layer, and Machine Learning (ML) Layer. Polisis treats a privacy policy as a list of semantically coherent segments and utilizes a taxonomy of privacy data practices.

### Application Layer
The Application Layer provides fine-grained information about the privacy policy, allowing users to pose queries with high modularity. It includes a Query Module that receives user queries and forwards them to lower layers for processing. The Class-Comparison module identifies segments with privacy classes matching those of the query and passes the matched segments back to the application.

### Data Layer
The Data Layer preprocesses the privacy policy using a Segmenter module in three stages: extraction, list handling, and segmentation. Given the URL of a privacy policy, the segmenter scrapes the policy’s webpage, removes irrelevant HTML elements, and handles ordered/unordered lists. It then performs an initial coarse segmentation and further subdivides segments using GraphSeg, an unsupervised algorithm that generates semantically coherent segments.

### Machine Learning Layer
The ML Layer produces rich and fine-grained annotations of the data segments. It takes as input the privacy-policy segments from the Data Layer and the user query from the Application Layer. The Segment Classifier probabilistically assigns each segment a set of class-value pairs describing its data practices. The Query Analyzer extracts privacy classes from the user’s query, and the class-value pairs of both the segments and the query are passed back to the Class Comparison module.

## 3. Data Layer
The Data Layer preprocesses the privacy policy using a Segmenter module in three stages:

### Policy Extraction
Given the URL of a privacy policy, the segmenter scrapes the policy’s webpage, removing irrelevant HTML elements. It handles dynamically viewable content, ensuring that the scraped content covers, on average, 99.08% of the manually fetched policy.

### List Aggregation
The segmenter handles ordered/unordered lists by combining short list items (maximum of 20 words per element) with the introductory statement into a single paragraph. Longer list items are transformed into a set of paragraphs, each prepended by the list’s introductory statement.

### Policy Segmentation
The segmenter performs an initial coarse segmentation by breaking down the policy according to HTML tags. It then subdivides segments using GraphSeg, an unsupervised algorithm that generates semantically coherent segments. The segmenter outputs a series of fine-grained segments to the Machine Learning Layer for analysis.

## 4. Machine Learning Layer
This section describes the components of Polisis’ Machine Learning Layer in two stages: building domain-specific word vectors and training a hierarchy of privacy-text classifiers.

### 4.1 Privacy-Specific Word Embeddings
Traditional text classifiers use words and their frequencies as features, but they have limited generalization power, especially with small training datasets. Word embeddings solve this issue by extracting generic word vectors from a large corpus, enabling transfer learning. We trained custom word embeddings for the privacy-policy domain using a corpus of 130,000 privacy policies.

These custom embeddings result in better classification accuracy compared to general-purpose pre-trained embeddings like Word2vec and GloVe. The features in the classifiers become the word vectors, allowing the classifier to account for words outside the training set as long as they are part of the large corpus used to train the word vectors.

By leveraging these components, Polisis provides a powerful and flexible framework for analyzing and presenting privacy policies, addressing the significant challenges faced by users, researchers, and regulators.
