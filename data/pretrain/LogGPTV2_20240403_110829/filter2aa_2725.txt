## Introduction
### Standard Pin-Tumbler Locks

- **Vulnerabilities:**
  1. **Key Duplication:** Keys can be easily copied at any hardware store.
  2. **Manipulation:** Susceptible to picking, impressioning, etc.

---

## The Schlage Primus
- **Mechanism:** Based on a pin-tumbler lock with an additional independent locking mechanism.
- **Security Features:**
  - Manipulation is possible but extremely difficult. Some skilled individuals can pick these locks in under a minute, but most cannot.
  - Focus of this presentation: Key duplication and its implications.

## 1. Reverse-Engineering the Primus
- **Patent Analysis:**
  - Security through patents.
  - Look up the patent for detailed specifications.
- **Service Manual:**
  - Available at: [w3.securitytechnologies.com/IRSTDocs/Manual/108482.pdf](http://w3.securitytechnologies.com/IRSTDocs/Manual/108482.pdf)
  - Additional online resources are available.
- **Sidebar Operation:**
  - Finger pins must be lifted to the correct height and rotated to the correct angle.
- **Disassembly:**
  - Obtain a lock and take it apart to fill in any missing details.

## 2. 3D Modeling Primus Keys
- **Top Biting Specifications:**
  - MACS = 7
  - Blade Width: 0.343"
  - Depth Tolerance: +0.002" -0"
  - Spacing Tolerance: Â±0.001"
  - Increment: 0.015"
  - Progression: Two Step
- **Side Biting Specifications:**
  - Scan 10 keys at 1200 dpi and extract parameters.
  - Example positions and measurements provided.
- **Modeling Requirements:**
  - Minimum slope: finger pin must settle to the bottom of its valley.
  - Maximum slope: key must go in and out smoothly.
  - Radiused bottom: matches the radius of a finger pin.
- **Key Cross-Section:**
  - One shape fits all Primus locks.
  - Dictated by physical constraints.
- **OpenSCAD Implementation:**
  - Programming language that compiles to 3D models.
  - Full implementation of Primus key is a few hundred lines of code.
  - Example code provided.

## 3. Fabricating Primus Keys
- **Hand Machining:**
  - Materials: Hardware store key blank ($1), Dremel-type rotary tool ($80), calipers ($20).
  - Process: Cut, measure, and repeat until the key is accurate.
  - Time: Rob can complete one in less than an hour.
- **Computer-Controlled Milling:**
  - Similar to the Schlage factory process.
  - High setup cost (hundreds of dollars) makes it impractical for one-off jobs.
  - Low-cost precision micromills are worth monitoring.
- **3D Printing:**
  - Game-changing technology.
  - Options:
    1. **Shapeways "Frosted Ultra Detail":**
       - Cost: $5 setup fee plus $2 per key.
       - Precision: Very good.
       - Strength: Insufficient to retract a latch.
    2. **Shapeways "White, Strong, and Flexible":**
       - Cost: $2 setup fee plus $1 per key.
       - Precision: Acceptable (operation is less smooth but functional).
       - Strength: Sufficient for most locks.
    3. **i.materialise "Titanium":**
       - Cost: $150 per key.
       - Precision: Very good.
       - Strength: Similar to a brass key.
  - Future Expectations: Prices are likely to decrease further.

## 4. Implications and Recommendations
- **Primus-Specific Results:**
  - Key decoding is easy.
  - Key duplication is easy.
  - Master key extrapolation is easy.
  - Keyless manipulation remains difficult.
- **Recommendations:**
  - The Schlage Primus should not be used for high-security applications.
  - Existing installations should reevaluate their security needs.
- **General Implications:**
  - This is an industry-wide problem.
  - Key duplication will become more accessible.
  - Physical security will increasingly depend on information security.
  - Patent protection will become less useful.
  - Examples: 3D printed car key by Ryan Weaving and 3D printed disc detainer key by Nirav Patel.

## Audience Projects
- **Contribute 3D Models:** Share 3D models of other keys (e.g., Medeco).
- **Integrate with Software:** Combine 3D models with existing image-to-key decoding software.
- **Website for Exchange:** Start a website for the exchange of 3D models of interesting keys.
- **Example:** New York City "master keys." What will happen once 3D models of these become available?
