### Conceptual Similarity to Related Work

Our approach is conceptually similar to the work of Marchal et al. [33], who propose using Markov chains based on past phishing websites to proactively predict future phishing URLs. In a different but complementary direction, we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown significant accuracy improvements in other fields compared to traditional machine-learning classifiers. However, CNNs typically require much larger ground-truth datasets, making them less practical for our current needs. We anticipate that our proposed classifier, or a simplified heuristic such as alerting on tweets containing unregistered domain names, could generate the necessary dataset, enabling a transition to more advanced classifiers in the future.

### Related Work

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to draw attention to the phenomenon of unintended URLs in social media and to characterize the threat they pose to users.

#### Twitter and Spam Research

Due to its popularity, Twitter has been a target for various forms of abuse, leading to extensive research. Studies have quantified spam activity on the platform [25, 48, 21, 42] and developed methods to detect fake accounts [47, 43, 19] and differentiate them from compromised accounts [22, 51]. These efforts have also extended to other popular social networks [24, 6]. A key differentiator in our work is that the unintended URLs are posted by legitimate, benign users, not spammers. As demonstrated, attackers can register these accidentally-introduced URLs, exposing followers to malicious content.

#### Username Changes and Web Cloaking

Researchers have also investigated the security implications of allowing users to change their usernames on social platforms [34] and the potential for attackers to confuse users through web cloaking [40].

#### Typosquatting and Domain Squatting

The negative consequences of typos on security and privacy have been extensively studied in the context of domain squatting. Typosquatting, where attackers register mistyped domain names (e.g., twitte.com) to capture traffic, has been characterized in various studies [14, 17, 28, 35, 52, 45]. While typos are one reason for unintended URLs, our research shows that the primary cause is the semantic gap between what a user types (e.g., a sentence with a missing space or an Instagram ID) and what Twitter interprets as a URL.

#### Expansion of Valid TLDs

Social media platforms, including Twitter, are increasingly identifying URLs due to the constant expansion of valid top-level domains (TLDs). Besides traditional generic TLDs (like .com and .org) and country-code TLDs (like .it and .es), ICANN has approved over 1,200 new gTLDs since 2013, such as .life, .love, and .beer [5]. This expansion, combined with user typos, increases the likelihood of unintended URL identification. Some researchers have questioned whether these new TLDs meet real user needs or simply create more opportunities for domain squatting and trademark abuse [26, 37].

### Conclusion

In this paper, we demonstrated that the automatic link-rendering feature of popular social media, combined with incorrect spelling and punctuation, can result in unintentional URLs. We presented a threat model where adversaries exploit this phenomenon to launch attacks on users who click on these unintended links. Our evaluation of several online platforms, with a focus on Twitter, highlighted the extent of this problem.

Given the volume of Twitter data, we proposed features for supervised machine learning to identify unintended URLs in user tweets. Over a period of seven months, our classifier processed millions of tweets and discovered 26,596 unintended URLs. We analyzed the properties of these URLs and characterized the potential abuse by registering 45 domains found in unintended URLs. We found that attackers who register these domains shortly after they are posted on Twitter can receive visits from hundreds of unsuspecting users following trusted accounts.

Finally, we introduced a lightweight browser extension that warns users when they are about to tweet text containing an unintended URL. Our study sheds light on the previously unexplored issue of unintended URLs and encourages online platforms to re-evaluate their link-rendering algorithms and consider warning users about unintended URLs. Additionally, it highlights the importance of being cautious when authoring messages on social media, where a simple typo can be weaponized to expose millions of users to malicious content.
