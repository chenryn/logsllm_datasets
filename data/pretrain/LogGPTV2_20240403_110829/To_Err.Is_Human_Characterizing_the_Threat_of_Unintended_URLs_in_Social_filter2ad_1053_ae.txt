conceptually similar to the work of Marchal et al. who
propose Markov chains built from past phishing websites, to
proactively predict future phishing URLs [33]. Orthogonally
to predictive classiﬁcation, a separate direction is to experi-
ment with convolutional neural networks that have exhibited
immense accuracy improvements in other ﬁelds, compared to
traditional machine-learning classiﬁers. These classiﬁers tend
to require signiﬁcantly larger ground-truth datasets compared
to traditional machine-learning algorithms which made them
inapplicable for us. We expect that our proposed classiﬁer
(or our simpliﬁed heuristic of alerting on tweets including
unregistered domain names) could produce such a dataset and
therefore enable a transition to more advanced classiﬁers in
the long run.
VII. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst one
to draw attention to the phenomenon of unintended URLs in
social media and to characterize the threat that they pose to
users.
Due to its popularity, Twitter has attracted large amounts of
abuse and commensurate amounts of past research. Spam has
always been an issue which has inspired work that quantiﬁes
the spam activity on the platform [25], [48], [21], [42] as
well as methods to detect fake accounts [47], [43], [19] and
differentiate them from compromised accounts [22], [51], both
on Twitter as well as other popular social networks [24],
[6]. An important differentiator of our work is that the un-
intended URLs are legitimately posted by benign users, not
by spammers controlling fake and compromised accounts. As
we showed in this paper, attackers can, after the fact, register
the accidentally-introduced URLs and therefore expose the
followers of the original Twitter users to arbitrary malicious
content.
Orthogonally to spam and account hijacking, researchers
have also investigated the security side-effects of allowing
users to change their usernames on popular social network
platforms [34] as well as whether attackers can confuse users
about the nature of posted URLs via web cloaking [40].
The negative consequences of typos to the security and pri-
vacy of users have been extensively studied in the area of do-
main squatting. Typosquatting speciﬁcally, refers to attackers
registering mistyped domain names (such as twitte.com)
in an attempt to capture all the trafﬁc from users who mistype
a website’s URL in their browsers. Past research has charac-
terized the typosquatting abuse in the wild [14], [17], [28],
[35], [52], [45] as well as the effects of typos in related areas,
such as, website development [36], package managers [2], and
mobile app stores [27]. In this paper, we discovered that while
typos are one of the reasons for unintended URLs (where a
Twitter user intends to tweet one URL but tweets another), the
main culprit of unintended URLs is the semantic gap between
what a user types (such as a sentence with a missing space or
an Instagram ID) and what Twitter infers that that user typed
(i.e., a URL).
One of the reasons why Twitter and other social network
platforms are so eager to ﬁnd URLs in user tweets, is the
constant expansion of valid domain TLDs. Next to traditional
generic TLDs (such as “.com” and “.org”) and country-code
TLDs (such as “.it” and “.es”), ICANN has, since 2013,
approved more than 1,200 new gTLDs, such as, “.life,”
“.love” and “.beer”
[5]. These new gTLDs combined
with user typos are making it more likely that a social network
platform will identify URLs when users never intended them.
For at least some of these TLDs, researchers have questioned
whether they fulﬁll a real user need or are just creating more
opportunities for domain squatting and trademark abuse [26],
[37].
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we showed that the automatic link-rendering
feature of popular social media, combined with incorrect
spelling and punctuation, can result in unintentional URLs.
We presented a threat model on social media platforms in
which an adversary abuses this phenomenon to launch attacks
on users who click on those unintentional links. We evaluated
the link-rendering behavior of several online platforms to show
13
the extent of the problem and focused on the manifestation of
unintended URLs on Twitter.
Given the volume of Twitter data, we proposed features that
can be used in the context of supervised machine learning to
identify unintended URLs in user tweets and used our classiﬁer
over a period of 7 months, processing millions of tweets and
discovering a total of 26,596 unintended URLs. We analyzed
the properties of these unintended URLs and characterized the
abuse that attackers could inﬂict by registering 45 domains
found in unintended URLs. There, we discovered that, as long
as attackers register unintended domains shortly after they
are posted on Twitter, they will receive visits from hundreds
of unsuspecting Twitter users who are merely following the
links posted by trusted user accounts. Lastly, we presented
a lightweight browser extension which will warn users when
they are about to tweet text that includes an unintended URL.
Our study sheds light on the previously unexplored issue
of unintended URLs which we hope will be used by online
platforms to re-evaluate their link-rendering algorithms and
consider warning users when unintended URLs are about to be
posted. At the same time, our work highlights the importance
of being careful when authoring messages on social media,
where the absence of a space can now be weaponized to expose
millions of users to malicious content.
