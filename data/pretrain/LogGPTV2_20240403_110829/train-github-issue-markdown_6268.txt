  * VSCode Version: 1.1.0
  * OS Version: Windows 8.1 Pro
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Create new/edit existing SQL file.
  2. Enter a string with a backslash as the last character before the terminating single quote.
  3. Syntax highlighting thinks the terminating quote is escaped.
SSMS does not behave like this, and will parse the same script without this
issue.
Also reproduces when starting VSCode with the --disable-extensions command
line argument.

The select statement on line 4 shouldn't be that colour, since it is not part
of the string.
The same snippet in SSMS:
