When I make use of the built-in `withStyles` HOC I don't get the automatic
vendor prefixing despite the following pieces of documentation claiming
otherwise:
  * When should I use inline-style vs withStyles()? it says that we can make use of `withStyles` in order to gain the benefit of vendor prefixing.
  * CSS-in-JS states that Material UI uses JSS at its core with the `jss-preset-default` which includes the `jss-vendor-prefixer` plugin.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Vendor prefixes should be generated for certain style rules like `display:
'flex'` or `transform: 'translateX(100px)'`
## Current Behavior
No vendor prefixes are generated
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

  1. Inspect the element `Test`
  2. Notice that no vendor prefixes are generated when looking at the class `.ExampleContainer-root-1`
