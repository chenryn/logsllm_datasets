Assistant: There are some important safety steps you should follow when upgrading the operating system kernel and rebooting the server. 1. Back up data: Before upgrading the kernel, you should back up the data in the system. In this way, even if problems such as upgrade failure or data loss occur, you can restore to the previous state. 2. Update the package manager: Before upgrading the operating system kernel, the package manager should be updated first. This ensures that all packages are up to date, reducing the chance of failed OS kernel upgrades. 3. Upgrade the kernel: After backing up the data and updating the package manager, you can start upgrading the operating system kernel. The specific steps can be adjusted according to your operating system. 4. Verify the kernel upgrade: After upgrading the operating system kernel, you should verify that it is installed and working properly. The verification method can be to check the upgrade log, check the kernel version number, etc. 5. Restart the server: If the kernel upgrade was successful, the server should be restarted. Before restarting, you should ensure that the settings server does not start automatically. This allows you to do further checks before rebooting. 6. Monitor the restart process: After restarting the server, you should pay close attention to its entire restart process. If any issues are found, immediate action needs to be taken to resolve them. 7. Restore data: If any problem occurs during the restart process, you can use the backed up data to restore to the previous state. In conclusion, upgrading the operating system kernel requires caution and following strict security procedures. This ensures that system upgrades are successful and data is adequately protected.
