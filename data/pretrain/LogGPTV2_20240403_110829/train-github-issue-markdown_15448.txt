Compressing our debug info might offer a significant, cheap file size win.
Things to do:
  * Figure out which targets to compress debug info for by default.
  * Provide a linker flag to control compression on/off.
  * Teach the linker to compress debug info.
  * Teach the Go packages how to read compressed debug info.
