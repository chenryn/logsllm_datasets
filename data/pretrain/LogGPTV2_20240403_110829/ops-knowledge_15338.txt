Question: A debate is ongoing about the importance of firmware update capabilities in Internet-connected devices. One argument claims that external security measures are sufficient to protect devices without firmware update capabilities. Which of the following best counters this argument?
"A": "Firmware updates are not necessary if the device is not storing any sensitive information.",
"B": "Specifying requirements for firmware updates and ensuring integrity checks can prevent installing untrusted firmware, countering the need for external measures.",
"C": "Designing devices to be disposable after a short period can be more cost-effective than implementing firmware updates.",
"D": "External security measures cannot correct the root weakness in the firmware, leaving devices permanently vulnerable."
Answer: D
