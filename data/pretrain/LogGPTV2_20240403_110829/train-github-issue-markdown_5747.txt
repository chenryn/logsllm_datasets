Subject: Issue with "data-dismiss" Attribute in Bootstrap Modals

Hi Team,

I have encountered an issue while testing the modals on the Bootstrap documentation page. Here are the steps to reproduce:

1. Visit [Bootstrap JavaScript - Modals](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals).
2. Click the "Launch Demo Modal" button twice to open and close the modal.
3. Observe that the escape key (on the keyboard) successfully closes the modal.
4. However, clicking the "Close" button (which uses `data-dismiss="modal"`) fails to close the modal.

This functionality worked correctly in RC1.

Best regards,  
Mike
