## INVESTIGATING THE UNEXPECTED {#c01.xhtml#head-2-12}
::: section
[]{#c01.xhtml#c01-sec-0013}
You\'re sitting in your office, putting the final touches on a
presentation that you\'re giving in an hour on cybersecurity trends that
your specific industry is experiencing to the C‐level employees at your
company. You\'re feeling confident with your data. You are hitting the
Save button after every major change. You\'re concentrating on the
agenda in your presentation when a balloon in your task pane from your
antivirus software pops up and notifies you that an IP address will be
blocked for 600 seconds.
As most end users do, you click the X with no hesitation and continue
building your presentation. Then you notice you have mail in your inbox
from your firewall. It is an alert notification. You start to worry less
about your presentation and start thinking a possible breach is being
attempted against your host.
You open a command shell and drop a `netstat –nao`. Not only will this
give you the protocol, local/foreign address, and state but also the
process identifier (PID) associated with that communication. You can
easily get overwhelmed by the data displayed, but check your taskbar.
Are there any network‐centric applications running? Close your browsers
and try `netstat –nao` again.
Did anything change? Are there any foreign addresses or odd port numbers
that you\'ve never seen before?

Two ports to be wary of are 4444 and 31337. Port 4444 is the default
port that Metasploit will use as a default listening port. Port 31337
spells *eleet*.
*Leet speak* originated in the 1980s when message boards discouraged the
discussion of hacking. The purposeful misspelling of words and
substitution of letters for numbers was a way to indicate you were
knowledgeable about hackers and circumvent the message board police.
When we substitute letters with numbers to enhance our passwords, we are
using leet speak for good.
If either of these two ports shows up in your NetStat statistics, it\'s
time for a procedure that has been previously agreed upon to kick in.
Either pull the network cable on this machine or alert your incident
response (IR) team so they can triage the situation and make the best
decision on how to stop the attack. My own personal recommendation is
that if you have an IR team, use it. If you pull the plug on an
attacker, you lose valuable forensic information.[]{#c01.xhtml#Page_14

## PuTTY {#c01.xhtml#head-2-13}
Up until now, all the tools discussed are embedded in your operating
systems. This tool will require a little more effort on your part. PuTTY
is a free, open‐source terminal emulation, serial console, and network
file transfer program. Originally written for Windows, it has evolved to
be used with other operating systems. PuTTY is an amazingly versatile
tool that allows you to gain secure remote access to another computer
and is most likely the most highly used SSH client for the Microsoft
Windows platform.
I believe that many IT professionals who have been in the industry for a
while lose track of where we have been. We keep adding knowledge and
experience and expertise to our repertoire and think, "Everyone should
know that." As an educator, I am not allowed to do that. It\'s my job to
show you how to use all these new shiny things in your toolbox. I can
hear some people saying, "You had me until SSH!"
Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol for creating an encrypted
channel over an unencrypted network. The Internet is *way* unsecured.
You don\'t want your data out there in the World Wide Web dangling
freely for all to see! SSH provides a computer administrator with a safe
way to reach a system that is remote using strong authentication and
secure, encrypted data transmission. There have been times as an
administrator when part of my responsibilities were to manage computers
I could not reach out and physically touch---execute commands or move
files from one computer to another. SSH is the protocol most hosts
support. An SSH server, by default, will listen on TCP port 22.
As I mentioned earlier in this chapter, SSH creates an encrypted channel
to communicate over. The first version of SSH debuted in 1995. Brad Pitt
was the Sexiest Man Alive, Mel Gibson\'s *Braveheart* won Best Picture,
and [Match.com](http://Match.com) was new and the only online dating
site. A lot...and I mean a lot has changed since then. Over the years,
several flaws were found in SSH1, and it is no longer used. The current
SSH2 was adopted in 2006 and uses a stronger encryption algorithm to
improve security. As of yet, there are no known exploitable
vulnerabilities in SSH2, although there have been rumors that the
National Security Agency (NSA) may be able to decrypt some SSH2 traffic.
In [Lab 1.6](#c01.xhtml#c01-fea-0008){#c01.xhtml#R_c01-fea-0008},

1.  [You can download a copy of PuTTY from `www.putty.org`. There will
    be a link on the page that takes you to the package file. Make sure
    you are getting the correct version for the hardware you are
    running. One size does not fit all.]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0031}
2.  [Double‐click the file you just downloaded. Follow the instructions
    until you finish the installation and then open PuTTY by
    double‐clicking the icon that looks like two old computers linked
    together with a lightning bolt.[]{#c01.xhtml#Page_15 .pagebreak
    title="15" role="doc-pagebreak"}]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0032}
    When the software starts, a PuTTY Configuration window should open,
    such as what you see in [Figure
    1.10](#c01.xhtml#c01-fig-0010){#c01.xhtml#R_c01-fig-0010}. The
    window pane on the left side lists the categories: Session,
    Terminal, Window, and Connection. The right side of the window will
    change depending on what category you have selected on the left.

    window](Images/c01f010.jpg){.center width="491" height="476"}
3.  [In the Session view, enter the domain name or IP address you want
    to connect to. Port 22 specifies that you will be using SSH. The
    Connection Type setting lets you choose one of the following
    options:]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0033}
    -   [**Raw**: This is usually used by developers for
        testing.]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0034}
    -   [**Telnet**: Telnet is no longer secure. Passwords are sent in
        clear text. This is a bad idea.]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0035}
    -   [**Rlogin**: This is legacy, which means old (like 1982 old). It
        uses port 513 and only connects Unix to Unix. Ignore
        it.]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0036}
    -   [**SSH**: This is the protocol most hosts support. An SSH
        server, by default, will listen on TCP port
        22.]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0037}
    -   [**Serial**: This is used for controlling some physical
        machinery or communication devices.]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0038}
4.  [After you have supplied the IP or domain address, you should get a
    terminal window, which will ask for your credentials. If you are
    able to supply them, you will have a command‐line terminal on the
    machine you just accessed. Some useful commands include the
    following:]{#c01.xhtml#c01-li-0039}
      --------- -----------------------------------------
      `pwd`     Present working directory
      `cd`      Change directory
      `cd ~`    Go to the home folder
      `ls`      List files
      `ls –h`   List files with the size
      `cp`      Copy a file
      `cp –r`   Copy a folder with all the files inside
      `mv`      Move a file
      `mkdir`   Make a directory
      `rm`      Delete a file
      --------- -----------------------------------------
    The session will terminate when you press Ctrl+D.

### NOTE
[]{#c01.xhtml#Page_16 .pagebreak title="16" role="doc-pagebreak"}The
first time you connect another system, you may be prompted to accept the
server\'s SSH key or certificate. It might have some wording like "The
server\'s host key is not cached in the registry." You see an example in
[Figure 1.11](#c01.xhtml#c01-fig-0011){#c01.xhtml#R_c01-fig-0011}. This
is normal. When you click Yes, you are establishing trust between the
two hosts.

I truly hope that I have given you a foundation to start to build on and
that you have added these tools to your cybersecurity toolkit. Some of
these tools may have just been a review for you, and some of them might
have been new. These tools will help you not only with troubleshooting
networks but with securing them as well.

In 2012, I left the great state of Louisiana for Colorado to take a
position with the Communications‐Electronics Command (CECOM) at Fort
Carson for the U.S. Army. My job was to train soldiers for information
assurance (IA). The Department of Defense has a requirement that any
full‐ or part‐time military service member or contractor with privileged
access must have certain computer certifications. This was known as DoDD
8570. My role was to teach these certification classes to help soldiers
achieve the correct IA level needed so they could perform their job.
My commandant Ryan Hendricks is a networking guru, and he wanted to stay
in his Cisco classes. Someone was needed to teach A+, Network+,
Security+, Server+, CASP, and CISSP as well as Microsoft Active
Directory, SCCM, and SharePoint. We both held the opinion that it
wasn\'t fair for us to teach the class if we didn\'t hold the
certification. He continued down the Cisco path, and I skipped down the
CompTIA/Microsoft certification path.
While studying for these certifications, I had many "aha" moments that
are still relative today. In fact, when I am teaching my certification
classes for Rapid7, I often take a few moments while everyone is getting
settled into his or her seat after lunch to show class members some of
these cool troubleshooting tricks for Windows. It\'s a bit of a bonus
for coming back to class on time.
