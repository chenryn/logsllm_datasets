## Abstract
Open proxies forward traffic on behalf of any Internet user. These proxies, often listed on open proxy aggregator sites, are frequently used to bypass geographic restrictions or circumvent censorship. They can also provide a weak form of anonymity by concealing the requestor’s IP address.

To better understand their behavior and performance, we conducted a comprehensive study of over 107,000 listed open proxies, involving 13 million proxy requests over a 50-day period. While previous studies have focused on malicious open proxies that manipulate HTML content to insert or modify ads, our study provides a broader examination, including availability, success rates, diversity, and (mis)behavior of these proxies.

Our results show that the majority (over 92%) of listed open proxies are unresponsive to proxy requests. More concerning, we found numerous instances of malicious open proxies that manipulate HTML content for cryptocurrency mining (cryptojacking). We also detected TLS man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks and discovered instances where binaries fetched through proxies were modified to include remote access trojans and other malware. For comparison, we conducted a similar study on Tor exit relays and found no instances of TLS MitM or content manipulation, suggesting that Tor offers a more reliable and secure form of proxied communication.

## 1 Introduction
Open proxy servers are unrestricted proxies that allow access from any Internet user. They are prevalent on the Internet, with several websites maintaining large lists of available open proxies. Unlike VPNs and some anonymity systems, open proxies require minimal configuration changes, making them easy for users to use.

There is a variety of types of open proxies with differing capabilities, leading to varied usage. Open proxies have been misused for malicious purposes, such as sending spam, injecting ads, and serving as stepping stones for various attacks. However, they have also been used for legitimate reasons, such as circumventing censorship and accessing regionally restricted content. Along with VPNs, proxies have been suggested as a means of enhancing Internet privacy and protecting browsing history.

The motivations for running open proxy servers are not well understood. Some proxies may be due to misconfiguration or compromise, while others are operated by choice, possibly as a political statement about privacy and information access. A more sinister motivation is that proxy operators can eavesdrop on communication, perform MitM attacks, and monetize their service by injecting ads.

We are not the first to suggest that open proxies should be treated with skepticism. Our study builds on previous work, particularly Tsirantonakis et al. [46], who explored the extent to which open proxies modify proxied HTML pages to inject ads, collect user information, and redirect users to malware-containing pages. Our study complements theirs by conducting a larger and more comprehensive analysis of the Internet’s open proxies.

## 2 Background
The Socket Secure (SOCKS) protocol was introduced in 1992 to ease the configuration of network firewalls. SOCKS allows clients to tunnel TCP and UDP traffic through a proxy to their chosen destinations. SOCKSv4 and SOCKSv5 are both deployed on the Internet, with the latter adding authentication features for access control. In this paper, we use the term "SOCKS proxies" to describe proxies running either version.

More commonly, open proxies use HTTP as a transport mechanism, supporting clients whose local firewall policies prohibit non-HTTP traffic. We distinguish between two types of HTTP-based proxies:
1. **HTTP Proxies**: These allow clients to specify a fully-qualified URL as part of an HTTP GET request. The proxy fetches the URL and forwards the response back to the client. However, HTTP proxies are incompatible with end-to-end security protocols like TLS.
2. **CONNECT Proxies**: These use the HTTP CONNECT method to establish end-to-end tunnels between the client and the destination web server, supporting TLS/HTTPS connections.

Open proxies are listed on aggregator sites, which sometimes categorize them as transparent (supporting at least end-to-end TCP tunneling) and anonymous (not revealing the client’s IP address).

## 3 Related Work
Previous studies have investigated the use and misuse of proxies on the Internet. Weaver et al. [52] found that 14% of tested connections were proxied. Scott et al. [40] provided insights into the use, distribution, and traffic characteristics of open proxies but did not focus on detecting malicious behavior. Jessen et al. [41] explored the abuse of open proxies for spam. Tyson et al. [47] studied HTTP header manipulation, and Huang et al. [31] showed that ASes sometimes interfere with HTTP traffic. Durumeric et al. [25] examined HTTPS interception, and Waked et al. [49] found that TLS middleboxes do not perform sufficient validation checks.

Tsirantonakis et al. [46] conducted an in-depth analysis of malicious behavior by open HTTP proxies, focusing on JavaScript injection. Our study complements theirs by providing a broader analysis of 107,000 unique open proxies, evaluating their availability, performance, and behavior across a wide range of potential attacks. We also compare our findings with those of Tsirantonakis et al. and evaluate the behavior of open proxies based on different client locations.

## 4 Methodology & Experimental Setup
Our study aimed to measure the availability, composition, and performance of open proxies and to assess the degree to which they exhibit malicious behavior. We conducted our study over a 50-day period, from 2018-04-12 to 2018-05-31, using 16 geographically diverse client locations, including 15 AWS regions and one installation at Georgetown University.

### Data Collection
From each client location, an automated process performed the following steps daily:
1. **Populate**: We collected and combined lists of advertised proxies from various aggregator sites and augmented this list with results from ProxyBroker [22]. The complete list of sources is shown in Table 1.
2. **Classify**: We attempted to classify each proxy by testing its availability and behavior.

**Table 1: Sources of Open Proxies**
| Source                     | Number of Proxies |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| clarketm [10]              | 6,343             |
| multiproxy.org (all) [5]   | 1,524             |
| multiproxy.org (anon) [6]  | 373               |
| NordVPN [9]                | 29,194            |
| ProxyBroker [22]           | 73,905            |
| workingproxies.org [15]    | 1,250             |
| xroxy [16]                 | 345               |
| **Total (Unique Proxies)** | 107,034           |

This comprehensive approach allowed us to gather detailed data on the behavior and performance of open proxies, providing a robust basis for our analysis.
