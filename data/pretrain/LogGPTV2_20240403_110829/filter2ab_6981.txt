**ATT&CK ID:** T1555.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Keychain

Adversaries may attempt to acquire credentials from the macOS Keychain, which is a credential management system that securely stores various types of sensitive information, including account names, passwords, private keys, certificates, sensitive application data, payment details, and secure notes. There are three primary types of Keychains:

1. **Login Keychain:** This is the default Keychain and is used to store user-specific passwords and other sensitive information. It is unlocked automatically when the user logs in.

2. **System Keychain:** This Keychain stores items that are accessed by the operating system, such as shared resources among multiple users on a single host. The System Keychain is typically protected by a different set of permissions compared to the Login Keychain.

3. **Local Items (iCloud) Keychain:** This Keychain is used for syncing sensitive information across devices via Appleâ€™s iCloud service. It allows users to access their stored credentials on any device linked to their iCloud account.

By targeting these Keychains, adversaries can gain access to a wide range of sensitive data, potentially compromising the security of the affected system and its users.
