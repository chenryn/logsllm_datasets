This is on OSX 10.10.1 with Atom 0.15.0
I had an issue today where I ran out of disk space, and Atom seemed to wipe
out a previously saved file.
As in, this file had already been saved, I opened it in Atom, saved, then I
quit Atom. Then when I restarted Atom, the file was empty.
I checked with `ls`, the file was empty and 0 bytes.
I do understand that running out of disk space is certainly not a normal
condition, but is there any explanation that would explain how Atom would
completely wipe out the contents of the file as a result?
