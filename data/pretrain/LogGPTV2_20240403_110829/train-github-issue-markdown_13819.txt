## üìù Performance Stats on Taskbar

This feature allows users to toggle the display of performance statistics on the taskbar, with the option to customize which specific stats are shown.

Displaying performance stats on the taskbar, rather than on the main screen, helps conserve valuable screen real estate. It also enables users to quickly check their computer's status without needing to move or minimize any open windows. This is particularly useful compared to tools like RainMeter and Sidebar Diagnostics, which can be more intrusive.
