## 📝 Performance Stats on Taskbar
This feature is On/Off, with ability to customize what kind of stats are to be
displayed in the taskbar.
To have the stats on taskbar, but not on the main screen is to SAVE screen
estate, also user can rapidly take a glimpse of the computer's stats without
need to move the existing windows or minimize windows (i.e. Issue with
RainMeter, Sidebar Diagnostics).
Great examples of this include:  
(1) XMeter(https://entropy6.com/xmeters/)  
(2) OSS - TrafficMonitor
(https://github.com/zhongyang219/TrafficMonitor/blob/master/README_en-us.md)
Similar MacOS product:  
(1) iStats
