### Title: Behind the Scenes: How Criminal Enterprises Pre-infect Millions of Mobile Devices

**Abstract:**
Mobile devices, including smartphones, smartwatches, and smart TVs, are increasingly being pre-infected with malicious firmware before they even reach the end users. This growing threat poses significant risks to both individual consumers and enterprises. Many businesses outsource the manufacturing of their mobile devices, a process that can be vulnerable to infiltration by third-party threat actors.

In this presentation, we will delve into the operations of a criminal enterprise that has successfully infected millions of Android devices. These infections transform the devices into mobile proxies, enabling the theft and sale of SMS messages, social media and online messaging accounts, and generating revenue through fraudulent advertisements and click fraud. Our research indicates that this problem is not only widespread but also continuously expanding.

**Key Points:**

1. **Scope and Scale of the Problem:**
   - We manually analyzed dozens of stock firmware images to confirm the presence of malicious software.
   - Telemetry data confirms the existence of millions of infected devices globally, with a significant concentration in South-East Asia and Eastern Europe.
   - The problem is truly global, affecting a wide range of devices and regions.

2. **Criminal Operations and Monetization:**
   - We will discuss how these criminal enterprises operate, including their methods for infecting devices and monetizing them.
   - Insights into the techniques used to identify and analyze a large number of stock firmware images will be shared.

3. **Supply-Chain Ecosystem:**
   - An overview of the ecosystem of supply-chain targeting criminal groups and their modus operandi will be provided.
   - Understanding the vulnerabilities in the supply chain and how they are exploited by threat actors.

**Conclusion:**
This presentation aims to shed light on the growing issue of pre-infected mobile devices and provide actionable insights for businesses and individuals to protect themselves from such threats. By understanding the scope, scale, and operational methods of these criminal enterprises, we can better mitigate the risks associated with the global supply chain.

**Audience Takeaways:**
- Awareness of the risks associated with pre-infected mobile devices.
- Understanding of the methods and motivations behind these criminal operations.
- Techniques for identifying and analyzing malicious firmware.
- Strategies for protecting against supply-chain attacks.
