As Unicode TR11 suggested, all neutral characters map to halfwidth or narrow
characters.
According to EastAsianWidth following characters are neutral:
✖ 0x2716  
✚ 0x271A  
✭ 0x272D  
✹ 0x2739
so they should be halfwidth or narrow, but is rendered full-width in CMD.exe,
which is causing terminal disarrangement.
