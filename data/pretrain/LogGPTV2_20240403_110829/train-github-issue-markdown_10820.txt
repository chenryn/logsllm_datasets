**Current behavior**
I am currently working on a project based on
https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter. Everything is
working fin in dev deployement (npm run server:dev ).
But after a `npm run build:prod` and `npm run server:prod` when I try to
access to my app I have this js error :
http://pasteboard.co/9llDiJNGv.png
    function _split(t) {
        return t.match(c)
    }
Currently after pretty print in chrome the error seem to be an error in my
component routing somewhere. I will investigate more but I post this issue
because is not normal that my code is working in dev but not in prod. If I
find why I will post the answers here.
Currently my routing look like:  
app.routes.ts:
    export const ROUTES: Routes = [
      { path: '', loadChildren: './app//.module#Module' },
      { path: '**',    component: NoContent },
    ];
.routing.ts:
    const routes: Routes = [
      { path: "",
        component: Component,
        children: [
          { path:"", component: ListComponent},
          { path:"", component: },
          { path:"", component: },
            { path:"", component: },
            { path:"", component: },
        ]
      }
    ];
**Expected behavior**  
No javascript error and my app working like in dev mode
**Reproduction of the problem**  
Can't see how.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Having a working app
