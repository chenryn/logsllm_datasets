User: I can run the command line version of Python but I cannot seem to run it from the command prompt. I have recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8 and it worked fine with Windows 7. Now Windows 8 will not recognize Python. Thanks, William
Assistant: The reason why it works from the Menu Item but not from the command prompt is that the menu item specifies the "Start in" directory where the Python executable can be found.
Chances are the Win 7 -> Win 8 upgrade failed to preserve the PATH environmental variable, where the path the Python was previously specified, allowing you to invoke Python from any command prompt console.
