Assistant: Whether there is an exception: There is an exception Exception type: Hardware exception Exception reason/solution: The error log is the system kernel log, which shows that the system has found an error during the memory access operation and has successfully corrected it. Therefore, it can be determined that the exception type is a hardware exception. This error is usually caused by a damaged memory module or a problem with memory access. It is necessary to troubleshoot this error, check whether the system memory has reached its usage limit or is loose, and check the system memory. If the memory module is damaged or there is a problem with memory access, the relevant hardware components need to be replaced, and the system should be tested to ensure that the problem has been completely resolved. After fixing the problem and testing the verification, the system can be rebooted to resume normal service.
