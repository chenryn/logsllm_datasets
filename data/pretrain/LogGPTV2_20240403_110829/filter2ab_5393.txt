**ATT&CK ID:** M1037  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Filter Network Traffic

To effectively filter network traffic and mitigate potential attacks, consider leveraging the services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or specialized DoS mitigation providers. These services can help filter malicious traffic upstream, before it reaches your infrastructure.

- **Boundary Traffic Filtering:**
  - **Block Source Addresses:** Identify and block the IP addresses that are generating the attack.
  - **Block Targeted Ports:** Restrict access to the specific ports that are being targeted by the attackers.
  - **Block Malicious Protocols:** Prevent the use of protocols that are being exploited for the attack.

- **SYN Flood Mitigation:**
  - Enable **SYN Cookies** to protect against SYN flood attacks. This technique allows the server to manage incoming connection requests more efficiently, even under high load conditions.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly enhance your network's resilience against various types of attacks.
