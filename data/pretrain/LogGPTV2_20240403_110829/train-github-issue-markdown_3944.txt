I have developed a relatively simple Flutter application and have been testing it in debug mode on my device. However, when I attempt to relaunch the app from the recent apps list, the app restarts, and no previous state is retainedâ€”even if I relaunch it just a few seconds later. 

Could you please help me understand why this is happening and how I can preserve the app's state?
