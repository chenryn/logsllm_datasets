ABSTRACT
Despite network monitoring and testing being critical for
computer networks, current solutions are both extremely ex-
pensive and inﬂexible.
This demo presents OSNT (www.osnt.org), a community-
driven, high-performance, open-source trafﬁc generator and
capture system built on top of the NetFPGA-10G board which
enables ﬂexible network testing. The platform supports full
line-rate trafﬁc generation regardless of packet size across
the four card ports, packet capture ﬁltering and packet thin-
ning in hardware and sub-µsec time precision in trafﬁc gen-
eration and capture, corrected using an external GPS device.
Furthermore, it provides a software APIs to test the data-
plane performance of multi-10G switches, providing a start-
ing point for a number of different test cases. OSNT ﬂex-
ibility is further demonstrated through the OFLOPS-turbo
platform: an integration of OSNT with the OFLOPS Open-
Flow switch performance evaluation platform, enabling con-
trol and data plane evaluation of 10G switches. This demo
showcases the applicability of the OSNT platform to eval-
uate the performance of legacy and OpenFlow-enabled net-
working devices, and demonstrates it using commercial swi-
tches.

INTRODUCTION
Computer networks are the hallmark of 21st Century
society and underpin virtually all infrastructure in the
modern world. Consequently, society relies on the cor-
rect operation of these networks. To make networks
more reliable, enormous resources are poured into all
phases of the network-equipment lifecycle. The pro-
cess starts early in the design phase when simulation
is used to verify the correctness of a design, and con-
tinues through manufacturing and perhaps months of
rigorously trials. With a multitude of Internet RFCs
and hundreds of IEEE standards, a typical piece of net-
working equipment undergoes hundreds of conformance
tests before being deployed. Finally, when deployed in a
production network, the equipment is tested regularly.
Throughout the process, a relentless battery of tests
and measurement help ensure the correct operation of
the equipment. This has led to a multi-billion dollar
industry in network test equipment giving rise to com-
panies such as Ixia, Spirent, Fluke, and Emulex/Endace
among others.

OSNT
However, such equipment has evolved with a num-
ber of undesirable characteristics: commonly closed and
proprietary systems with limited ﬂexibility well outside
the reach of most universities and research laboratories.
Researchers and educators would also like to use test
equipment to understand current networks and when
prototyping new ideas. We therefore built the Open
Source Network Tester (OSNT [1]), primarily for the
research and teaching community. The ﬁrst prototype
has been conceived on top of NetFPGA-10G platform 1
– an open source hardware platform supporting full line-
rate across the four 10G ethernet ports.
OSNT provides two primary distinct functionalities:
traﬃc generation and monitor. The OSNT traﬃc mon-
itor subsystem provides high–precision inbound times-
tamping with a loss-limited path that gets (a subset
of) captured packets into the host for further process-
ing. The design associates packets with a 64-bit times-
tamp on receipt by the MAC module, thus minimising
queueing noise. The timestamp resolution is 6.25 nsec
with clock drift and phase coordination maintained by a
GPS input. In addition, the traﬃc capture functional-
ity provides wildcard-enabled packet ﬁlters and packet

cutting and hashing in hardware. The OSNT traﬃc
generation subsystem provides a PCAP replay function
with a tuneable per–packet inter–departure time. The
traﬃc generator has an accurate timestamping mech-
anism, located just before the transmit 10GbE MAC.
The mechanism, identical to the one used in the traf-
ﬁc monitoring unit, is used for timing-related network
measurements, such as latency and jitter. When en-
abled, the timestamp is embedded within the packet at
a preconﬁgured location and can be extracted at the
receiver as required.
The OSNT platform provides a simple and programmer-
friendly API to control the traﬃc generation and mon-
itoring functionality of the OSNT design, enabling the
realisation of high precision and throughput measure-
ment tests in software. OFLOPS-turbo is an holistic
OpenFlow switch evaluation framework which takes ad-
vantage of the OSNT high-precision measurement capa-
bilities. Using OFLOPS-turbo users can develop mea-
surement modules which can access information from
multiple measurement channels (data and control plane
and SNMP) and measure the impact of the switch Open-
Flow implementation in data plane performance with
high precision.
OSNT is a highly ﬂexible and function-rich frame-
work, which provides the building blocks for the reali-
sation of a wide range of network test scenarios. By pro-
viding an open-source solution we invite everyone from
the community to audit (and improve) our implementa-
tion as well as adapt it to their needs. We believe that,
as an open-source community grows, a low-cost open-
source network tester will also prove valuable to the
networking industry. We also envisage the enabling of
new testing and validation deployments that are simply
ﬁnancially impractical using commercial testers. Such
deployments may see the use of hundreds or thousands
of testers, oﬀering previously unobtainable insights and
understanding.
2. DEMONSTRATION DESCRIPTION
The ﬁrst part of the demo showcases OSNT and how
the original implementation can be used to evaluate the
performance of multi-10G legacy switches. The second
part of the demo showcases how OSNT can be improved
and adapted to diﬀerent needs. In particular, how the
OSNT APIs can be used in order to develop a testing
framework to evaluate the performance of multi-10G
OpenFlow-enabled switches. Speciﬁcally, we present
OFLOPS-Turbo [2]: an eﬀort to enhance the measure-
ment capabilities of the OFLOPS [3] switch evaluation
framework with support for the emerging protocol re-
quirement.
Part I: Legacy Switch testing.
This part of the demo showcases OSNT main func-
2
tionalities and how to exploit them to accurately mea-
sure the packet-processing latency of a legacy switch
under diﬀerent load conditions. OSNT consists of a
software driver supporting command-line and graphic-
user interfaces (CLI and GUI), traﬃc generators and
monitors modules. Users can generate traﬃc at a ﬁnely-
controllled rate up to 10Gbps per port, and capture
high-resolution timestamped packets to evaluate the achiev-
able bandwidth and latency of a network device. Two
OSNT ports will be connected to the tested switch.
One of the ports will be used to generate traﬃc at vari-
able rates with the transmission timestamp embedded
in each packet, while the other port will be used to cap-
ture pakets after they traverse the switch. Packets will
be received by a userspace application with transmis-
sion and capture timestamps and the application will
accurate estimate the switching latency.

Part II: OpenFlow Switch testing.
This part of the demo will showcase the ability to
leverage the traﬃc generation and monitoring capabil-
ities of the OSNT platform in software and implement
high precision evaluations of a switch control plane func-
tionality. Speciﬁcally, we will setup an instance of the
OFLOPS-turbo framework on a host and run multi-
ple measurement tests against a production OpenFlow
switch. OFLOPS-turbo implements numerous baseline
measurement scenarios that target the elementary Open-
Flow protocol interactions. During the demo we will
focus on a test which measures the latency to modify
the entries of the switch ﬂow table through control and
data plane measurements, using the topology presented
in Figure 2. Through the conducted measurements, we
will elaborate on the impact of the control plane imple-
mentation on the network performance, as well as on
forwarding consistency during large ﬂow table updates.
