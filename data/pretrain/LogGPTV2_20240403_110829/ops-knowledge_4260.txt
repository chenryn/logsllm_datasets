User: Explain what load balancing is, and provide a commonly used load balancing strategy.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technique for distributing workloads across multiple servers to improve system reliability, performance, and scalability. Load balancing can balance the load of different servers, reduce the pressure on servers, and optimize the operating efficiency of the system. Commonly used load balancing strategies include: 1. Round robin load balancing strategy: distribute requests evenly to all servers to ensure that each server can be fully utilized. 2. Load balancing strategy with the least number of connections: Send the request to the server with the lightest load at the moment, so as to avoid some servers from being under greater load. 3. IP hash load balancing strategy: The request is routed to a specific server based on the hash value of its source IP address to ensure that requests with the same IP address are always routed to the same server. 4. Random load balancing strategy: Randomly allocate requests to servers to avoid the problem that some servers are overused.
