Assistant: This log chunk shows the kernel generating cores (25048, 58777, 49137, 42553, 2109, 718, 10752, 323, 21112, 28370) and various interrupts (program interrupt, illegal instruction, privileged instruction, data store interrupt caused by dcbf, icbi). There is also a fatal error related to a program image.
