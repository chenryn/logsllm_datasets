# Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test and Authentication System

## Overview
The K-S test is a statistical method used to compare two empirical distributions. In the context of this document, it is employed alongside the total variation distance to authenticate users based on their driving behavior.

## Online Testing Phase
### Data Preprocessing
The online testing phase for data from an unauthenticated user follows a similar process to the training phase. The raw data undergoes preprocessing, where relevant features are selected and parsed into a test vector \( D \).

### Predictor Component
1. **Test Vector Generation**: Let \( D_i \) denote the current test vector generated by the driver identification system. 
2. **Fingerprint Vector**: Let \( F \) denote the fingerprint vector, which is a reference vector created during the training phase.
3. **Comparison and Estimation**:
   - Upon obtaining \( D_i \), the predictor compares \( F \) with an augmented test vector \( D_i' \), where \( D_i' = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} D_j + D_i \).
   - Three metrics are examined after the comparison:
     1. **Similarity Calculation \( d_1 \)**: Measured using the K-S test.
     2. **Similarity Calculation \( d_2 \)**: Measured using the total variation distance.
     3. **Length \( l \)**: The number of test vectors that form the augmented test vector \( D_i' \).

### Decision Rules Based on Metrics and Thresholds
- **Thresholds**:
  - \( t1_{\text{low}} \) and \( t1_{\text{high}} \) for \( d_1 \).
  - \( t2_{\text{low}} \) and \( t2_{\text{high}} \) for \( d_2 \).
  - \( t_{\text{both}} \) for the sum of \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \).
  - \( t_l \) for the length \( l \).

- **Decisions**:
  - If both \( d_1 \leq t1_{\text{low}} \) and \( d_2 \leq t2_{\text{low}} \), the user is temporarily authorized.
  - If one of \( d_1 \leq t1_{\text{low}} \) or \( d_2 \leq t2_{\text{low}} \) is true, and \( d_1 + d_2 \leq t_{\text{both}} \), the user is temporarily authorized.
  - In any other case, the user’s identity remains unknown.
  - If either \( d_1 > t1_{\text{high}} \) or \( d_2 > t2_{\text{high}} \) at any time, the user is unauthorized.
  - If \( l < t_l \) and the current driver has been temporarily authorized or remains unknown, the predictor continues authentication with the next block of input data.
  - If \( l \geq t_l \) and the above rules resulted in authorization, the user is identified as the owner. Otherwise, if the user remains unknown, authorization fails, and an alert is made.

## Comparison Tools
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test**: Compares the empirical probability distributions of the fingerprint and augmented test vectors.
- **Total Variation Distance**: Measures the distance between the distributions, providing an additional metric for their variation.
- **Calculation**: The difference between the vectors is calculated using the total number of features (distributions) in the test vector that fail the K-S test and the sum of their variations.

## Testing Logistics
- **Data Collection**: Testing data was gathered using Android devices with acceleration information from vehicles.
- **Implementation Strategies**:
  - **Smartphone Installation**: Install a smartphone in the vehicle with the system implemented, and have it text an alert to the owner's personal phone upon detecting unauthorized use.
  - **Car Computer Integration**: Implement the theft detection system into the car’s computer, allowing for more direct measurement of driver’s acceleration preferences.

## False Alarm Handling
- **Minimizing Annoyance**: False alarms can be minimized as the system notifies the owner via text message.
- **Adjusting Thresholds**: Lowering test thresholds can make the tests more stringent, decreasing the time required to identify theft but increasing false alarms slightly.

## Mimicry Attacks
- **Complexity**: Successfully mimicking another driver requires constant attention to several complex factors, making such attacks highly implausible.

## Driving Events and Metrics
### Driving Event Types
- **Six General Driving Events**: Increasing speed, maintaining speed (cruising), coasting, braking, turning, and changing lanes.
- **Acceleration Analysis**: Each event is a type of acceleration, and human preferences in performing these events are a function of force tolerance and reasoning.

### Speed Effects on Events
- **Behavior Variations**: Users’ behavior varies at different speeds due to environmental factors.
- **Data Partitioning**: Using speed ranges as sub-features for driving events helps in assembling robust fingerprint and test vectors.

### Example
- **Figure 4**: Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (ECDFs) of two users’ positive acceleration data, partitioned by four velocity ranges, showing marked differences between their respective data and the full data.

This structured approach ensures a clear, coherent, and professional presentation of the authentication system and its components.
