To effectively implement CIS Control 14.3, which focuses on training workforce members on authentication best practices, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Develop a Comprehensive Training Program:**
   - Create a structured training program that covers essential topics such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), strong password composition, and effective credential management.
   - Ensure the training materials are up-to-date with the latest security standards and best practices.

2. **Identify Training Needs:**
   - Assess the current knowledge level of your workforce regarding authentication best practices.
   - Tailor the training content to address any gaps or areas where employees may need more guidance.

3. **Conduct Regular Training Sessions:**
   - Schedule regular training sessions for all employees, including new hires and existing staff.
   - Use a variety of training methods, such as in-person workshops, online courses, and interactive simulations, to cater to different learning styles.

4. **Reinforce Learning:**
   - Provide ongoing support and resources, such as FAQs, tip sheets, and access to security experts.
   - Conduct periodic refresher courses to ensure that the information remains fresh and relevant.

5. **Monitor and Evaluate:**
   - Track the effectiveness of the training program through assessments and feedback from participants.
   - Use this feedback to make continuous improvements to the training content and delivery methods.

6. **Integrate Training into Organizational Culture:**
   - Promote a culture of security awareness by integrating authentication best practices into the day-to-day operations of the organization.
   - Encourage employees to report any suspicious activities and provide them with clear guidelines on how to do so.

CIS Control 14.3 is categorized under the "Protect" security function and does not specify a particular asset type, making it applicable to all organizational assets.

By following these steps, an organization can ensure that its workforce is well-informed and capable of implementing strong authentication practices, thereby enhancing overall security.
