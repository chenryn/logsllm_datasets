# Analysis and Discussion

## Accuracy of Delay Mean Estimates

In Figures 6(a) and 6(b), we present the average relative error of per-flow delay mean estimates, binned by true flow delays and flow sizes, respectively. The accuracy of our method, RLI, is generally consistent across both real router packet traces (WISC) and backbone traces (CHIC and SANJ).

### High Utilization vs. Low Utilization

We observe that RLI performs better under high utilization conditions compared to low utilization. This can be attributed to the fact that at high utilization, the median delay is higher, leading to more significant differences in latency. For example, in the CHIC trace, the average per-flow latencies are approximately 390 μs, 11.4 μs, and 1.0 μs for high, moderate, and low utilizations, respectively. At low utilization, serialization time becomes a more dominant factor in latency, which introduces more jitter and, consequently, higher errors in the interpolation process.

### Grouping Flows by Delays

In Figure 6(a), we focus on the high utilization condition, as 99.99% of per-flow latencies in moderate and low utilization scenarios are quite low (at most 90 μs and 10 μs, respectively). We are particularly interested in high-delay flows, so we analyze the top 50% of flows with average latencies starting from about 100 μs up to 30 ms. RLI shows an average relative error of around 12% for flows with true delays greater than 100 μs in the SANJ trace. In the CHIC trace, 75% of flows with about 100 μs latency have less than 18% relative error. The absolute error remains relatively small and bounded, making RLI effective for measuring flow-specific delay spikes of the order of a few hundred microseconds, which aligns well with SLA specifications provided by Cisco [1].

### Grouping Flows by Sizes

In Figure 6(b), we group flows by their sizes. For the top 20% of flows, which have more than 10 packets, the average relative error is less than 11%. For larger flows (with more than 100 packets), the error is even lower, around 3%. The WISC trace, collected over an OC-3 link, shows similar trends, with RLI achieving less than 11% average relative error for the top 20% of delays, which are around 3 ms.

## Accuracy of Delay Standard Deviation

While accurate mean latency estimates are important, it is also crucial to estimate the variation in delays, especially for flows with high standard deviations. In Figure 7(a), we present the CDF of the standard deviation estimates. The median error is less than 12%, with a small fraction of flows exhibiting higher relative errors. Similar CDFs for moderate and low utilization cases show that standard deviation estimates are more accurate under high utilization. When the true standard deviation is low, the relative error is high, but this proportion varies depending on the utilization characteristics. In Figure 7(b), we bin flows based on their true standard deviation and plot the average relative error. For standard deviations greater than 100 μs, the average relative error is less than 20%, and it decreases further for higher standard deviations.

## Comparison with Other Solutions

In Figure 8, we compare RLI with other solutions, including trajectory sampling and MFE, and also study the advantage of using the RLI estimator over the RLI-L estimator. We introduce a sampling rate of 0.1% to keep trajectory sampling overheads small. While MFE and RLI estimators do not directly depend on the sampling rate, it affects the set of flows created. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply the same sampling rate to all methods.

### High Utilization Case

In Figure 8(a), we plot the CDFs of relative errors in mean delay estimates. Trajectory sampling performs the worst, with a relative error greater than 80% for about 50% of the flows. MFE performs better by considering intermediate background samples, but RLI outperforms both, with most estimates within 1% relative error. RLI-L, which uses no interpolation buffer, performs better than MFE and trajectory but loses some accuracy compared to RLI.

### Across Different Utilizations

In Figure 8(b), we compare these solutions across a wide range of utilizations. RLI consistently outperforms the others, with the gap being more pronounced at higher utilizations where absolute delays are higher. RLI estimates are more than an order of magnitude more accurate than MFE in many cases.

### Scatter Plots

In Figure 9, we compare the true and estimated delays for individual flows using MFE and RLI. The key difference is the presence of extra timing information for each intermediate packet in RLI, which allows for better local estimates. This results in RLI outperforming MFE by one to two orders of magnitude in terms of relative error.

## Overheads of RLI

In Figure 10(a), we quantify the bandwidth consumed by reference packet traffic for different link utilization levels. At low utilization, where the reference packet traffic is injected at a higher rate (about 1-in-10 packets), the overall bandwidth consumed is about 0.1%. As utilization increases, the bandwidth consumption drops to 0.007% at 90% utilization. 

While low bandwidth usage is desirable, it is also important that the reference packet traffic does not significantly interfere with regular traffic. To quantify this, we measure the difference between the average latency experienced with and without reference packet traffic. Our results show that the interference is minimal, ensuring that the reference packet traffic does not adversely affect the performance of the network.
