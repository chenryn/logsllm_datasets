### Bringing Sexy Back to Penetration Testing

#### Introduction
Penetration testing, or "pentesting," has recently garnered a negative reputation. Despite the ongoing demand, many testers find it monotonous. This article explores why pentesting can be perceived as boring and offers two innovative, engaging, and effective methods to revitalize the process.

#### Why Is Pentesting Boring?
1. **Lack of Novelty**: Most pentests focus on mundane tasks like finding trivial PHP bugs or cracking passwords, rather than discovering zero-day vulnerabilities.
2. **Misunderstandings**: Clients often misunderstand the scope and value of a pentest. For instance, I was once hired to test a Class C network that had no active systems.
3. **Monotony**: Watching scanners run and performing repetitive tasks can be tedious. The excitement and intrigue are often missing.

#### Two Innovative Methods to Make Pentesting Exciting

##### 1. iPhone in a Box
This method involves using an iPhone to conduct a physical penetration test by mailing it to the target location.

**Step 1: Get a Box**
- Obtain a box. We used the original iPhone box because it is inconspicuous and the perfect size for our needs.

**Step 2: Prepare the iPhone**
- **Materials Needed**: iPhone, battery, and necessary cables.
- **Battery Life**: An iPhone with a fully charged battery can run for about 5 days with continuous activity. APC mobile batteries can extend this duration.
- **Box Preparation**: The box has enough room for the phone, battery, and cables. Some cutting of plastic may be required, which can be done easily with a knife.

**Step 3: Configure the iPhone**
- **Jailbreak the iPhone**: Install SSH and the BSD subsystems.
- **Install Necessary Tools**: tcpdump, APLogger, and other useful utilities.
- **Custom Configuration**:
  - **Remote Access**: Since you can't SSH directly to the iPhone's IP address, configure it to connect to you. Write a program that behaves like shellcode.
  - **Shell Process**: Start a process with a shell, redirect standard input and output, and connect to a predetermined address at specific intervals.
  - **Netcat Listener**: Set up Netcat on the receiving host to listen for connections. Schedule the process to run every hour using cron.
  - **Network Access**: Once connected, you can manually perform scans and access other machines within the network.

**Step 4: Mail the Box**
- Seal the box and mail it to the target location. When the connection is established, you will have access to the internal network.

##### 2. Phishing for Access
Phishing remains one of the most effective ways to gain entry into a Windows environment.

**Steps to Create a Phishing Campaign**
- **Objective**: Instead of just stealing passwords, aim to install software.
- **Vulnerable ActiveX Controls**: Use recent vulnerabilities in ActiveX controls to download and execute arbitrary programs.
- **Setup**:
  - **CMS Configuration**: Use a content management system (CMS) to create a website that mimics a benefit management company.
  - **Prompt Installation**: Configure the main page to prompt visitors to install a "secure" ActiveX control.
  - **Trojan Download**: The ActiveX control downloads and installs the trojan.
  - **Safeguards**:
    - Ensure the trojan does not infect any site visitor.
    - Set the trojan and ActiveX control to self-delete after a specified period.
    - Log all activities on the victim's machine.

**Demo**
- A live demonstration of the phishing campaign can showcase its effectiveness.
