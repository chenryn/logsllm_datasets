### Description
There is a great Operator for Cloud Functions:
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-
google/stable/operators/cloud/functions.html
But, if needing a bit more compute/control than the functions runtime
supports, utilizing Cloud Run could be ideal.
### Use case/motivation
Looking to be able to trigger Cloud Run jobs from Airflow akin to Cloud
Functions [ when needing to compute slightly larger things that don't work
with Functions ].
### Related issues
I did not see any related issues.
Hoping for some comment on whether this would be welcomed. If nobody else
would address, but would be a welcomed contribution, then I am happy to dig
into contributing.
