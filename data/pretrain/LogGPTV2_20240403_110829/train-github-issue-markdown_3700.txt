I use a program called `scoop` to install software which modifies the PATH.
# Environment
    PS C:\Users\trajano> [Environment]::OSVersion
    Platform ServicePack Version      VersionString
    -------- ----------- -------      -------------
     Win32NT             10.0.18947.0 Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18947.0
    Terminal Version: 0.3.2171.0
# Steps to reproduce
  1. `scoop install maven`
  2. start up a new tab
  3. run `mvn`
# Expected behavior
Maven should run
# Actual behavior
Maven does not run because it is not found in path  
Close Terminal (all tabs and windows)  
Start up Terminal again  
run `mvn` works again.
