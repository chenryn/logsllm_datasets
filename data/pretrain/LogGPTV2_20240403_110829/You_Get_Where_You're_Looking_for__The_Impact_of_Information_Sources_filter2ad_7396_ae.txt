Certainly! Here is the optimized and more coherent version of your text:

Data can be stored either locally or externally on an SD card. Implementations can access this data through a file system that may also be used to store databases and shared preferences. However, backend implementations for storing information in an app can vary. For example, SQLite is a common choice for database management, while shared preferences are used for simpler key-value storage.

Both the file system and backends (such as SQLite) can have secure and insecure implementations. All three methods—file system, SQLite, and shared preferences—can be distinguished by their security ratings. 

On Android, databases, file systems, and backends are rated based on their security. A solution that accepts all hostnames without proper domain checks is considered insecure. Conversely, a custom hostname verifier with a correct domain check is rated as secure. Additionally, using system permissions to protect data can enhance security.
