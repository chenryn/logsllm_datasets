### `wdsutil approve-autoadddevices`

**Applies to:** Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `wdsutil approve-autoadddevices` command is used to approve computers that are pending administrative approval. When the Auto-add policy is enabled, administrative approval is required before unknown computers (those that are not pre-staged) can install an image. This policy can be enabled using the PXE Response tab of the server's properties page.

**Syntax:**
```shell
wdsutil [Options] /Approve-AutoaddDevices [/Server:<server_name>] /RequestId:{<Request_ID>| ALL} 
[/MachineName:<machine_name>] [/OU:<distinguished_name>] [/User:<user_name>] 
[/JoinRights:{JoinOnly | Full}] [/JoinDomain:{Yes | No}] 
[/ReferralServer:<referral_server>] [/BootProgram:<boot_program_path>] 
[/WdsClientUnattend:<unattend_file_path>] [/BootImagepath:<boot_image_path>]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/Server:** Specifies the name of the server. This can be the NetBIOS name or the FQDN. If no server name is specified, the local server is used.
  
- **/RequestId:** Specifies the request ID assigned to the pending computer. Use `ALL` to approve all pending computers.
  
- **/MachineName:** Specifies the name of the device to be added. This option cannot be used when approving all computers.
  
- **/OU:** The distinguished name of the organizational unit where the computer account object should be created. For example: `OU=MyOU,CN=Test,DC=Domain,DC=com`. The default location is the default computer's container.
  
- **/User:** Sets permissions on the computer account object to give the specified user the necessary rights to join the computer to the domain.
  
- **/JoinRights:** Specifies the type of rights to be assigned to the user.
  - `JoinOnly`: Requires the administrator to reset the computer account before the user can join the computer to the domain.
  - `Full`: Gives full access to the user, which includes the right to join the computer to the domain.
  
- **/JoinDomain:** Specifies whether the computer should be joined to the domain as this computer account during operating system installation. The default value is `Yes`.
  
- **/ReferralServer:** Specifies the name of the server to contact to download the network boot program and boot image using Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).
  
- **/BootProgram:** Specifies the relative path from the `remoteInstall` folder to the network boot program that this computer should receive. For example: `boot\x86\pxeboot.com`.
  
- **/WdsClientUnattend:** Specifies the relative path from the `remoteInstall` folder to the unattended file that automates the Windows Deployment Services client.
  
- **/BootImagepath:** Specifies the relative path from the `remoteInstall` folder to the boot image that this computer should receive.

**Examples:**

1. To approve the computer with a RequestId of 12:
   ```shell
   wdsutil /Approve-AutoaddDevices /RequestId:12
   ```

2. To approve the computer with a RequestID of 20 and to deploy the image with the specified settings:
   ```shell
   wdsutil /Approve-AutoaddDevices /RequestId:20 /MachineName:computer1 /OU:OU=Test,CN=company,DC=Domain,DC=Com /User:Domain\User1 /JoinRights:Full /ReferralServer:MyWDSServer /BootProgram:boot\x86\pxeboot.n12 /WdsClientUnattend:WDSClientUnattend\Unattend.xml /BootImagepath:boot\x86\images\boot.wim
   ```

3. To approve all pending computers:
   ```shell
   wdsutil /verbose /Approve-AutoaddDevices /RequestId:ALL
   ```

This command and its parameters allow administrators to manage and approve pending devices in a structured and efficient manner, ensuring that only authorized devices can proceed with the imaging process.
