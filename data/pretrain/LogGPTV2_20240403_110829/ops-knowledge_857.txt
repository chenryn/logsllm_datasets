User: How can I stop/kill a running task on Airflow UI? I am using LocalExecutor.
Even if I use CeleryExecutor, how do can I kill/stop the running task?
Assistant: from airflow gitter (@villasv)

" Not gracefully, no. You can stop a dag (unmark as running) and clear
the tasks states or even delete them in the UI. The actual running
tasks in the executor won't stop, but might be killed if the
executor realizes that it's not in the database anymore. "
