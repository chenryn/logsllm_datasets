User: Now there is a batch of files that need to be quickly uploaded from one server to another. Please provide an efficient file transfer solution.
Assistant: File transfers can be done using the rsync or scp commands. The rsync command can implement incremental backups, and only transfer those parts that have changed, avoiding repeated transfers. Example command: rsync -avz source_path destination_path The scp command can also achieve fast file transfer, but does not support incremental backup. Example command: scp source_file user@host:destination_folder It should be noted that the speed of file transfer is also affected by factors such as network bandwidth and server load.
