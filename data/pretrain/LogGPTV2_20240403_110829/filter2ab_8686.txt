**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

Regularly review the permission levels of privileged cloud accounts to identify those that could provide an adversary with extensive access, such as Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator roles in Azure AD. [14][15][16] These reviews should also include checks for any newly created privileged cloud accounts that have not been authorized.

For example, in Azure AD environments, configure alerts to notify administrators when accounts have not used their privileged roles for an extended period. This can help identify roles that may no longer be necessary and can be removed. [17]

Consider implementing temporary, just-in-time (JIT) privileged access to Azure AD resources instead of permanently assigning privileged roles. [16] This approach minimizes the risk of long-term exposure to high-privilege accounts.
