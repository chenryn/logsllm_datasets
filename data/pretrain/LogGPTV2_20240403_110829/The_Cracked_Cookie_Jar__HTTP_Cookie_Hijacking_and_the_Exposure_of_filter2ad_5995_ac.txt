Location. Google Maps allows users to set their Home and
Work addresses, for easily obtaining directions to/from other
destinations. While Google Maps requires HTTPS, which
prevents us from acquiring any information,
if the adver-
sary connects to google.com over HTTP and searches for
“home” or “work”, the search results will contain a widget of
Google Maps revealing the respective address. An example can
be seen in Figure 3(b). Accessibility to location information
can expose the user to physical threats [26], [27].
Browsing history. Using the stolen cookie, the adversary can
start issuing Google searches for various terms of interest. If
the search results contain links that the user has previously
visited through the search engine, Google will reveal how
many times the page has been visited and the date of the
last visit. Users can opt-out of historical information being
included in their search results, however, this option is enabled
by default. If enabled, the adversary can search for a variety
of terms and infer sensitive data about the user. Figure 3(a)
shows an example scenario where the adversary obtains such
information. Depending on the attacker’s goal, she could
employ a precompiled dictionary of sensitive keywords for
ﬁnding sensitive web activity, or a dictionary of the most
popular Google search terms for recovering parts of the user’s
web visiting history. While previous work demonstrated that
unencrypted sessions could enable attackers to reconstruct
a user’s Google search history [4], this is the ﬁrst, to our
knowledge, attack that discovers webpages visited by the user
through Google.
Exploiting search optimization. Google search may return
results that have been personalized for the user, either by
inserting speciﬁc entries, or changing the rank of speciﬁc
results. Previous work has demonstrated a methodology for
measuring personalization in Google search results [28]. By
adapting this technique,
the adversary can extract entries
from the search results that have been returned based on
characteristics of the victim’s proﬁle.
Shopping. Using the HTTP google.com cookie when
visiting Google’s shopping page, which runs mainly over
HTTP, will reveal the user’s ﬁrst and last name, Gmail handle,
Google proﬁle. It also allows viewing and editing the user’s
shortlist (items under consideration).
Pollution attacks. If the attacker issues search queries using
the stolen cookies, the search terms are treated as if originating
from the user and added to the search history. This allows the
adversary to affect the victim’s contextual and persistent search
personalization through pollution attacks [29].
Youtube exhibits a strange behavior that we did not come
across in other services. If the victim is logged in, the stolen
cookie does not reveal any information. However, if the victim
is not logged in, the cookie that is exposed gives access to
the user’s recommended channels and videos, which can be
changed through pollution attacks. Furthermore, information

about the user’s music interests can be used to infer private
attributes [30].
B. Bing
According to a recent report [31], Bing handles approxi-
mately 20.4% of the desktop searches originating from the
U.S. Bing is also the default search engine for Siri, iPhone’s
voice-driven assistant, as well as all Microsoft-based products.
When auditing Bing we found that, by default, all connections
are served over HTTP, i.e., all searches are sent in clear-text.
Users have to explicitly type https in the browser’s address
bar to be protected from eavesdropping.
Personal
information. Bing will expose the user’s ﬁrst
name and proﬁle photo. The proﬁle photo can be used to
obtain more information of the user through face recognition
and publicly available data in other websites [32].
Location. If the victim has saved any locations on Bing
Maps they are also exposed. Apart from the work or home
addresses, this may include other locations the user has visited
in the past (e.g., bars, health clinics).
Interest Manager. This recently introduced feature, allows
users to select interests from a variety of topics. Based on the
category, this can reveal private information including ﬁnancial
assets and political inclination.
Search and browsing history. Once the adversary steals
the cookie, she can retrieve the user’s search history, including
those in the images and videos categories. Apart from a widget
displaying the users most recent and most frequent search
queries, the search history page also reveals the page that the
user visited from each search.
Pollution attacks. The attacker can also issue search queries
for conducting a pollution attack and, subsequently, delete
those entries for stealthiness. This will remove any trails of
the attack, and prevent the victim from detecting it.
C. Yahoo
Depending on the type of browser, and whether it
is
being run for the ﬁrst time, visiting yahoo.com through the
address bar will either connect to HTTP and then redirect to
HTTPS, or maintain the unencrypted connection. However,
links in the main Yahoo page are all redirected through
http://hsrd.yahoo.com. Even if the user explicitly

connects to Yahoo over HTTPS, if any link in the homepage is
clicked, it will connect to that subdomain over an unencrypted
connection. Therefore, regardless of how the victim connects,
we have identiﬁed three HTTP cookies (Y, F, T) that are
exposed to eavesdroppers. We ﬁrst describe the information
and functionality that attackers can access, and then how we
perform a cookie forging attack to remove the requirements for
the user to browse speciﬁc subdomains while being monitored.

The full last name and email address can also be obtained, as
we explain below.
information. The Y and T cookies set
Personal
Yahoo Mail. To facilitate sharing posts with friends, articles
in Yahoo contain an “Email to friends” button, which presents
a popup window in which the adversary can add an arbitrary
message, as shown in Figure 4. Furthermore, the Sender ﬁeld
has auto-complete functionality, which allows us to obtain the
victim’s complete contact list. These features combined can be
leveraged for deploying effective phishing or spam campaigns.
The contacts’ emails can be used for acquiring information
about those users from other services and deploying person-
alized spam campaigns [33]. The widget also contains the
user’s full name and email address. Extracting the contacts
requires all three cookies set for the main domain, while send-
ing the email requires them for the news.yahoo.com or

the finance.yahoo.com subdomain depending on which
section the article is located in.
If the user hovers over or clicks on the mail notiﬁcation
button, the attacker can also access the incoming mail widget,
which reveals the Sender and partial Subject (up to 21
characters) of the 8 most recent incoming emails. This is due
to a cookie being attributed an “authenticated” status. This
lasts approximately one hour, after which it cannot access the
widget. If at any point the user accesses the notiﬁcation button
again, the hijacked cookie is re-authorized.
Yahoo Search. Having acquired the main domain and
search subdomain Y and T cookies, the adversary can gain
access to the victim’s complete search history. Apart from
viewing the searched terms, these cookies allow editing the
history and removing previous searches. However, Yahoo ex-
plicitly states that even if past searches are deleted, user search
data is still logged. This enables stealthy pollution attacks;
after issuing search queries for inﬂuencing the personalization
proﬁle of the user, the adversary can then delete all issued
searches and remove traces of the attack.
Yahoo Answers. One of the many services offered by
Yahoo, is a popular “question and answer” site, where users
can ask any type of question, and other members of the
community can provide answers (albeit sometimes with ques-
tionable quality [34]). Users posting questions or answers, may
choose to remain anonymous for a given question, especially
if the topic is considered sensitive [35]. Upon auditing Yahoo,
we found that the victim’s HTTP cookie allows partial control
over the account; the adversary is able to ask or answer ques-
tions (either eponymously or anonymously), and also to view
and edit previous questions and answers posted by the vic-
tim. Thus, the adversary can effectively “deanonymize” posts
and obtain potentially sensitive information about the victim,
which was posted under the assumption of anonymity. The
adversary can also post comments as the victim in the com-
ment section of news articles. This requires the Y, T cookies
for the yahoo.com domain and the answers.yahoo.com
subdomain.
Yahoo Finance. Another service offered by Yahoo is related
to ﬁnancial news and functionality, and also offers tools for
users to manage their personal ﬁnances. This includes creating
portfolios with their stock information etc. The Y and T
cookies for the main domain and ﬁnance subdomain allow the
attacker to view and edit the victim’s portfolio. If the victim
visits the ﬁnance page, the corresponding cookies are exposed.
Cookie forging. Different cookie combinations provide
access to speciﬁc user information or account functionality
and, depending on the subdomain on which the information is
hosted, the respective cookies for those domains are required.
However, we can use a cookie acquired from one (sub)domain
to craft the same cookie for a different subdomain and gain
access to the speciﬁc information or functionality. For exam-
ple, if the user only visits the main Yahoo homepage during
the monitoring period, the attacker will obtain the Y, F, T
cookies for yahoo.com. The attacker can then “forge” those
cookies for the search.yahoo.com subdomain using the
corresponding value attributes of the hijacked cookies and
subsequently gain access to the user’s search history.
D. Baidu
Baidu is the leading search engine in the Chinese language
and among the top 5 sites according to Alexa. To create
an account in Baidu, the user is required to register either
with a Chinese mobile phone number or just provide an
email address. The majority of pages in Baidu are served
over an unencrypted connection. As with the other search
engines we tested, the HTTP cookie can expose signiﬁcant
private information to attackers. Apart from the proﬁle picture
and username,
the user’s email address is also revealed.
Furthermore, the user’s entire search history can be retrieved,
and pollution attacks are feasible. Finally, Baidu Maps allows
users to save locations, similar to Bing Maps, and all saved
locations can be obtained through the hijacked HTTP cookie.
E. E-commerce Websites
Amazon. The homepage follows the common approach of
redirecting to HTTPS if connected to over HTTP. However,
product pages are served over HTTP and, as a result, users’
cookies will be exposed during their browsing sessions.
Personal Information. The adversary can obtain the infor-
mation used by the victim for logging in; this includes the
victim’s username, email address and/or cell phone number.
Furthermore, when proceeding to checkout items in the cart,
Amazon also reveals the user’s full name and city (used for
shipping). Viewing and changing the user’s proﬁle picture is
also permitted. Amazon also allows users to post their reviews
under a pseudonym, which is not connected to the user’s name.
However, the adversary can view the user’s reviews (which
may include sensitive items), thus, breaking the pseudonymous
nature of those reviews. Previous work has demonstrated the
privacy risks of recommender systems and experiments in
Amazon indicated that sensitive purchases can be inferred
from the user’s review history [36].
Account History. The user’s HTTP cookie is sufﬁcient
for accessing private information regarding previous actions.
Speciﬁcally, the adversary can obtain information regarding
recently viewed items, and recommendations that are based
on the user’s browsing and purchase history. The wish-lists
where the user has added items of interest are also accessible.
Furthermore, the adversary can obtain information regarding
previously purchased items either through the recommenda-
tion page or through product pages (which depict date of
purchase). In an extensive study on privacy-related aspects of
online purchasing behavior [37], users rated the creation of a
detailed proﬁle from their purchase history and other personal
information as one of the most troubling scenarios.
Shopping Cart. The user’s cart
is also accessible, and
the adversary can see the items currently in the user’s cart.
Additionally, the cart can be modiﬁed, and existing items can
be removed, and other items can be added.
Vendor-assisted spam. We also found that the cookie ex-
poses functionality that can be leveraged for deploying spam

campaigns to promote speciﬁc items that are presented as
“endorsed” by the victim. The widget has an auto-complete
feature that reveals the contacts that the user has emailed in
the past. The attacker can either send emails about a speciﬁc
item or a wish-list, and can add text in the email’s body.
URLs can be included; while the email is sent as simple
text, email providers such as Gmail render it as a click-
able link. Since the emails are actually sent by Amazon
(PI:EMAIL), they are most likely to pass
any spam detection heuristics. Furthermore, the From ﬁeld,
contains the victim’s username, further strengthening the per-
sonalized nature of the spam/phishing email.
Extortion scams. Previous work has revealed how scammers
extorted money from users through One Click Fraud scams
by threatening to reveal “embarrassing” details about
the
users’ online activities [38]. In a similar vein, the attacker
can employ two different scam scenarios. In the ﬁrst case, if
the attacker identiﬁes potentially embarrassing item(s) in the
user’s viewing or purchase history, she can send an email to
the user disclosing knowledge about the item(s), and other
personal
the user, and request
money to not share that information with the user’s contacts
(even if no contact information has been collected). In the
second scenario, the attacker can send an email blackmailing
the user to pay money, otherwise she will send an email to
the victim’s friends and family with information about his cart
that is full of embarrassing items. Subsequently, the attacker
will add such items to the user’s cart or wishlist, and send
the corresponding email through Amazon to the victim’s own
email address as proof of her capabilities.
information obtained about
Walmart. Apart
from the information exposed in the
website, the cookie’s value attribute contains 34 ﬁelds of
information about the user and his account (see Appendix A).
F. News Media
Information acquired from media outlets can reveal charac-
teristics and traits of the user (e.g., political inclination), and
demographic information [39]. We audited the websites of sev-
eral of the most popular print or broadcast news organizations
(see Appendix A).
G. Indirect Information Exposure - Ad Networks
We explore the impact of hijacking ad network cookies. On-
line ads account for a signiﬁcant portion of website real estate,
and their ubiquitous nature has been discussed extensively in
the context of user tracking (e.g., [40], [41]). Here we focus
on Doubleclick, which is owned by Google, as it is the most
prevalent advertising network with a presence on 80% of the
websites that provide advertisements [42]. As opposed to most
of the previous services where the user had to explicitly visit
the website3, the cookies of an ad network can be exposed
by visiting any of a large number of websites that display ads
from the respective network. While the symbiotic nature of
service providers and data aggregators is complicated, the ads
3We found a popular e-commerce homepage that issues a Google search
request over HTTP, exposing the user’s cookies.

presented while browsing with stolen user cookies from ad
networks can be used to infer sensitive information.
An interesting aspect of hijacking ad-network cookies is that
they result in side-channel information leakage. We describe
two scenarios which leak different types of information.
Attack scenario 1. Consider a scenario where user U has an
account on the social networking service X, and has disclosed
various pieces of personal information in the proﬁle. Let us
also consider that U is knowledgeable and has correctly set
privacy settings to restrict public visibility of that informa-
tion, and X has gone to great lengths to protect users from
information leakage and also enforces ubiquitous encryption
across the website, including connections to third parties (e.g.,
when fetching ads). However, website X offers personalized
advertising and ad network A has obtained personal informa-
tion of U by setting different selection criteria over time and
identifying U across websites through an HTTP cookie. Now
lets consider that while being monitored by the attacker, U
browses a completely unrelated website Y which serves ads
by ad network A and does not enforce encrypted connections.
Even though U does not have an account on Y, the browser
sends the HTTP cookie for A, which can be used to identify U
and return an ad that is tailored to match information disclosed
by U in the original website X. The attacker can hijack the
exposed HTTP cookie for A, and receive ads tailored for
U. Based on the content of these ads, the attacker can infer
personal information of U.
Attack scenario 2. User U is browsing through an e-
commerce site E, which uses the ad network A to advertise its
products in other websites. U searches for items that belong
to a speciﬁc category C, and after the site returns a list of
relevant products, U clicks on a link and views the page of
product P. A short time later, the attacker visits an unrelated
website that is known to show various ads, and appends U’s
stolen HTTP cookie for the ad network A. The attacker is then
presented with several ads relevant to U’s browsing history.
Some are more generic and expose information about U’s
gender, while others explicitly refer to category C and even
depict the speciﬁc item P.
Information leakage. We conducted a small number of
manual experiments for identifying cases of personal informa-
tion being leaked by Doubleclick. Previous work has shown
that ads presented to users may be personalized based on
the user’s proﬁle characteristics [43], associated to sensitive
topics [44], [45] (e.g., substance abuse, health issues, sexual
inclination), and that advertisers can even obtain private user
information not explicitly provided by the service [46].
Here we describe one of our experiments for scenario 2. We
browsed maternity clothes on a popular e-commerce website,
and visited the page of a few returned products. We, then
browsed other sites from a different machine connected to a
different subnet, and appended the Doubleclick HTTP cookie
from the previous browsing session. We were presented with
ads from the e-commerce website advertising women’s cloth-
ing. Several ads even advertised a speciﬁc maternity product
whose page we had visited (see screenshots in Appendix A).
