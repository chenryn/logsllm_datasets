User: Please describe the principle and function of DNS server
Assistant: The principle of the DNS (Domain Name System) server is to convert human-readable domain names (such as www.baidu.com) into computer-readable IP addresses (such as 14.215.177.38). The function of the DNS server is to provide domain name resolution services. It maintains a domain name system database, converts domain names into corresponding IP addresses, or converts IP addresses into corresponding domain names. When a user needs to access a domain name, the browser will send a domain name query request to the local DNS server, and the local DNS server will recursively query other higher-level DNS servers, finally obtain the IP address corresponding to the domain name, and return the IP address to User's terminal equipment. The main functions of the DNS server include: 1. Domain name resolution. Resolve domain names into IP addresses. 2. DNS caching. Save part of the domain name resolution results locally to quickly respond to client query requests and reduce the load on the DNS server. 3. Provide DNS record management. Administrators can add, modify, and delete different types of DNS records on the DNS server, including A records, MX records, CNAME records, etc. These records describe the corresponding relationship between domain names and IP addresses, email servers, etc., so as to perform correct domain name resolution. 4. DNS load balancing. When a DNS server cannot satisfy high concurrent query requests, DNS load balancing technology can be used to distribute requests to multiple DNS servers for processing, thereby improving system availability and stability.
