## Abstract
Recent industry trends indicate the emergence of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that operate on existing cellular infrastructures. While MVNOs have seen significant growth and customer attraction in the US and other regions over the past two years, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting user concerns about cellular performance when choosing MVNOs over traditional cellular operators. This paper presents the first systematic measurement study to explore this emerging phenomenon. We examine the performance of three key applications—web access, video streaming, and voice—across two popular MVNO families (comprising a total of eight carriers) in the US. Each MVNO family includes a major base carrier and three MVNOs operating on top of it. Our findings reveal that some MVNOs exhibit significant performance degradation and that there are notable differences between the two MVNO families.

## 1. Introduction
A new trend has been emerging in the cellular market in the US and Europe: the rise of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). MVNOs leverage existing cellular infrastructures owned by traditional cellular operators, avoiding significant infrastructure and spectrum licensing costs. They offer services such as better prepaid plans and multiple quotas, differentiating themselves from traditional operators.

Although MVNOs began appearing in the early 2000s, they have only recently gained mainstream traction in terms of market share. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including increasing prices from traditional providers, consumer preference for non-contractual services, the popularity of prepaid plans, regulatory interventions, and market segmentation targeting niche demographics. As of Q1 2014, there were 20, 23, 11, and 35 MVNOs operating on the AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint networks, respectively, in the US.

Despite their growth, users express concerns about the performance of MVNOs. Common complaints include poor coverage, slow speeds, and frequent disconnections. For example:
- "I know that AIO is capped at 8mbps download speed. Are all other MVNOs like Straight Talk, Net10, and Air-Voice also limited to 8mbps download speeds? Do they suffer from higher latency?"
- "I have been throttled every day since last week, so each day I lose my 4G/E symbol and once I regain it, I'm throttled... I’ve used 1.4GB and I have only 3 days left on my 30-day plan."
- "Does Sprint have means of degrading service to Ting (and other MVNO) customers in favor of Sprint customers in a particular crowded cell?"
- "My only concern is the service quality. With Straight Talk, for example, I’d be on AT&T’s GSM network in Boston, I think... but I wonder if as an MVNO customer I’d get second-tier access or service."

Motivated by the growth of MVNOs and these user concerns, this paper presents the first comprehensive study on the performance of different MVNOs. Previous work in mobile performance analysis has not systematically examined MVNOs. We study two major MVNO families in the US, each including a base carrier and three popular MVNOs. To protect business interests, we anonymize the names of the carriers and MVNOs, referring to the base carriers as A and B, and their respective MVNOs as A1, A2, A3, and B1, B2, B3.

We analyze the performance of web access, video streaming, and voice calls using over 13,000 measurements collected across 11 locations over three months. Our key questions are:
- Does performance vary among MVNOs running on the same base carrier?
- Do MVNOs perform worse than the base carrier?
- Are there differences between the two MVNO families?

We use application-specific quality-of-experience (QoE) metrics and correlate observed performance with network-level metrics such as TCP throughput, round-trip times (RTTs), packet loss rates, DNS lookup times, and PHY-layer characteristics.

Our key findings are:
- The base carrier often outperforms MVNOs, sometimes significantly. For example, some MVNOs over base carrier B fail to load a non-trivial fraction of YouTube video requests and have up to 6x worse page load times.
- There is significant diversity in performance among MVNOs within the same family.
- There are non-trivial differences between the two MVNO families, with MVNOs on base carrier A generally performing better relative to their base carrier compared to those on base carrier B.
- Voice quality is largely similar across all MVNOs and base carriers, but there are large discrepancies in data performance for web access and video streaming.

This study aims to motivate future large-scale measurement studies in this area, covering wider areas, more MVNOs, and a variety of data plans.

## 2. Measurement Setup

### 2.1 Choice of Phone
To ensure consistency, we used the same phone model for all carriers: Google’s Nexus 4, which supports 2G/3G/4G (EDGE/UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+). All phones run Android 4.2.2 (JellyBean). Since the Nexus 4 only supports GSM-based carriers, this study is limited to such carriers and their MVNOs. Future work will investigate CDMA-based carriers and their MVNOs.

### 2.2 Choice of Carriers and Plans
We selected popular and widely-used MVNOs operating on two major base carriers in the US, referred to as carriers A and B. We used Google Trends and a list of available MVNOs to identify the top three MVNOs for each base carrier. Table 1 summarizes the six MVNOs and their plans. To provide a fair comparison, we selected similar plans for all carriers.

| Carrier | Plan (all pre-paid except B) | Type | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| A       | Unlimited talk/text, 2.5GB data @ 4G | Base | $60 |
| A1      | Unlimited talk/text, 2.5GB data @ 4G | MVNO | $45 |
| A2      | Unlimited talk/text, 3GB data @ 4G | MVNO | $50 |
| A3      | Unlimited talk/text, 2.5GB data @ 4G | MVNO | $60 |
| B       | Unlimited talk/text, 2GB data @ 4G | Base | $65 |
| B1      | Unlimited talk/text, 2.5GB data @ 4G | MVNO | $50 |
| B2      | Unlimited talk/text, 2GB data @ 4G | MVNO | $50 |
| B3      | Unlimited talk/text, 2GB data @ 4G | MVNO | $50 |

### 2.3 Data Collection
We selected 11 diverse locations spanning urban, suburban, shopping, residential, office, lab, and hospital settings. Figure 1 shows the geographical spread of our measurement locations, all within the Long Island/New York region, a major population hotspot.

We developed custom scripts and mobile applications for web browsing, video streaming, and voice calls, collecting relevant QoE metrics. At each location, four identically configured Nexus 4 phones (one for the base carrier and three for MVNOs) ran the same suite of experiments concurrently, typically hourly or half-hourly, over different days of the week.

On average, we conducted about 150 sets of measurements for each carrier across different locations during January-March 2014. Each set included web page access, video streaming, voice calls, and TCP upload throughput tests. Concurrently, we logged packet traces and phone characteristics for further factor analysis, ensuring minimal CPU overhead.

Our analysis did not reveal significant location, time-of-day, or day-of-week specific changes in performance. Thus, we present aggregate statistics and focus on performance differences across carriers and MVNO families.

## 3. Application Performance

### 3.1 Web Browsing
**Setup and QoE Metric:** We chose six popular websites with diverse characteristics: YouTube, Amazon, Wikipedia, Twitter, Bing, and CNN. We developed a custom browser application using Android WebViewClient. The app visits each website's mobile landing page and records the page load time, defined as the time from URL request to the `onPageFinished` event.

**Evaluation of Page Load Times:** Figure 2 shows the distribution of page load times across all runs. Key observations include:
- Carriers in MVNO family A generally perform better than those in MVNO family B.
- Differences between base carrier A and its MVNOs are modest, but significant differences exist between base carrier B and some of its MVNOs.
- There is non-trivial variability among MVNOs within the same family.

**Factor Analysis:** We analyzed lower-layer metrics such as DNS lookup time, RTT, TCP retransmission rates, and signal strength. We found that MVNO family A has generally lower RTTs and retransmission rates than MVNO family B. Within MVNO family A, A1, which had higher page load times, indeed has higher RTTs. In MVNO family B, B2 and B3, which have the highest page load times, see very high retransmission rates.

Further analysis of packet traces showed significant TCP idle times, contributing to high page load times for B1, especially for sites like CNN.
