### Attestation Costs and Architectures

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM)-based architecture represents the upper bound on the cost of attestation, as TPMs are designed for use in desktop PCs with virtually unlimited power supplies. In contrast, software-based architectures offer a more cost-effective alternative, though ongoing hardware and software innovations may lead to even more economical solutions. This section emphasizes that attestation introduces significant costs, which justifies our approach of using a limited number of attested nodes to establish trust in spectrum sensing results. The specific trade-off between trust and cost can be tailored on a case-by-case basis.

#### Sources of Cost

Attestation costs arise from several sources:

1. **Hardware Resources**: Remote attestation often requires additional hardware, such as coprocessors, which increase manufacturing costs. Even software-based schemes may necessitate larger memories to store code and data.
2. **Energy Consumption**: Components involved in remote attestation, including coprocessors and processors executing software routines, consume energy. Coprocessors may also draw power when inactive, and enlarged memories can require additional energy.
3. **Network Utilization**: Remote attestation transactions increase the amount of network data transmitted and received, leading to higher energy consumption by wireless radios. Increased network usage can also introduce time costs due to the processing of attestation transactions.

#### Evaluation of TPM and Software-Based Attestation

We evaluated an Atmel AT97SC3203 TPM installed in a desktop PC. The TPM imposes a manufacturing cost for the chip itself and potentially for expanded memories to support interface software on the attested processor. Using a Digital Multi-Meter (DMM), we measured its energy consumption. The TPM draws 10.6 mW of power when idle, which accounts for most of its total energy consumption. It consumes approximately 58.9 mJ when generating an attestation certification. Other operations require some energy but do not significantly contribute to total consumption due to their infrequent invocation or the absence of expensive routines like digital signature generation. Attestation operations take around 1.1 seconds to execute and generate at least 276 bytes of uncompressed data if the TPM uses a 2048-bit RSA key and the 160-bit SHA-1 hash algorithm, regardless of the specific protocol used. For reference, we measured the energy consumption of a Digi XBee 802.15.4 radio using an oscilloscope and found that transmitting a packet with an x-byte payload consumes about (0.017x + 1.83) mJ of energy at 1 mW.

We also evaluated a software-based attestation scheme on an Atmel AVR32 AT32UC3A0512 microcontroller. This scheme only consumes extra energy when active and uses Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) with shorter keys (192 bits in this prototype) and simpler computations. Despite the lack of hardware accelerators, it consumes similar amounts of energy during attestation operations. Each operation takes about 0.6 seconds to execute, and each attestation generates at least 68 bytes of data due to the significantly shorter keys.

### Related Work

#### White Space Networks

Much of the prior work in white space networks focuses on detecting individual attackers within a cell through various abnormality detection techniques. However, these methods are ineffective against cells dominated by attackers [15, 31]. For example, Min et al.'s correlation-based filter approach fails to detect attackers constituting more than one-third of the nodes in a cell. Fatemieh et al. [18, 19] propose detecting attacker-dominated cells using outlier detection and classification techniques, but their solutions do not consider remote attestation and are insufficient if neighboring cells are also controlled by attackers.

#### Primary User Emulation (PUE) Attacks

Another body of related work addresses primary user emulation (PUE) attacks [16, 29], where an attacker modifies the air interface of a radio to mimic a primary transmitter signal, causing legitimate secondary users to misidentify the attacker as a primary user. We consider this problem orthogonal to the one we address.

#### Sensor Networks

In the context of sensor networks, Wagner introduced resilient aggregation [38], studying the resilience of various aggregators to malicious nodes using statistical estimation theory and robust statistics. However, his work is limited to small regions and does not consider attack detection. Zhang et al. [40] propose a framework to identify readings inconsistent with the distribution of readings in a cluster of nearby sensors, but it cannot handle situations where a large fraction of nodes in a cluster are compromised. Hur et al. [23] propose a trust-based framework in a grid, where each sensor builds trust values for neighbors and reports them to the local aggregator. Their solution, however, does not account for natural uncertainties in the data, lacks a global view for a centralized aggregator, and cannot identify compromised regions.

#### Remote Attestation in Sensor Networks

Several works have explored using remote attestation for security in sensor networks, including proposing architectures and building platforms [35], detecting compromised nodes [39], and activities like secure code updates and key establishment [34]. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has considered using attestation to defend against malicious false reports by omniscient attackers in the context of white-space distributed spectrum measurement.

#### Insider Attacker Detection

Insider attacker detection in wireless networks is another area of related work. Liu et al. [28] propose a solution where each node builds a distribution of observed measurements and flags deviating neighbors as insider attackers. However, this solution is local and peer-to-peer and is ineffective in areas with more than 25% attackers.

### Conclusions

Using statistical sequential estimation and classification methods can help evaluate and improve the trustworthiness of spectrum sensing results generated by a network with a limited number of attested nodes. These methods reduce the total cost incurred by attestation. Our results show that attestation capability for as low as 15% of the nodes can provide protection against more than 94% of attacks from coordinated attackers. Protection improves as the fraction of attested nodes increases. Our evaluation determined that the Biased node inclusion strategy is the most effective at deterring attacks but also generates more false positives than Random or Geo-diverse strategies. Future research should explore other strategies and develop a framework for formulating costs associated with including regular and attested nodes, balancing the costs of spectrum data aggregation and remote attestation with obtaining robust aggregation results.
