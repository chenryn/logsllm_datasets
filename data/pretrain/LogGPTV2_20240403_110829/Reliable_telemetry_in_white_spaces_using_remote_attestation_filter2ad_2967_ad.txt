ware adaptations. The TPM-based architecture represents an up-
per bound on the cost of attestation, since the TPM is intended
for use in desktop PCs with practically unlimited power supplies.
The software-based architecture represents a low-cost alternative,
although hardware and software innovations may result in archi-
tectures with even lower costs. The reason we include this section
is to emphasize the fact that attestation introduces signiﬁcant costs,
which motivates our approach to leveraging relatively few attested
nodes to establish trust in spectrum sensing results. The speciﬁc
tradeoff between trust and cost can be made on a case-by-case ba-
sis.
Costs arise from various sources. Remote attestation support of-
ten requires additional hardware resources, which increase manu-
facturing costs. Some schemes involve a coprocessor, and even
those primarily implemented in software may necessitate larger
memories to store their code and data. Additional energy may
be consumed by several components involved in a remote attes-
tation transaction. Coprocessors and processors executing software
routines both consume energy. Additionally, coprocessors usually
consume some energy when inactive, and enlarged memories may
require additional energy. Remote attestation transactions increase
the amount of network data that is transmitted and received, which
may also increase the energy consumption of the wireless radio.
Increased network utilization can also impose time costs, as can
remote attestation transaction processing.
We evaluated an Atmel AT97SC3203 TPM installed in a desktop
PC. It imposes a manufacturing cost for the TPM chip itself, and
potentially for expanded memories to support interface software
installed on the attested processor. We measured its energy con-
sumption using a Digital Multi-Meter (DMM). It draws 10.6mW
of power when idle, which is likely to account for the bulk of its
total energy consumption. It consumes around 58.9 mJ when an at-
testation certiﬁcation is generated. Other operations require some
energy, but are unlikely to contribute signiﬁcantly to total consump-
tion either due to their infrequent invocation or the fact that they
do not involve expensive routines such as digital signature gener-
ation. Attestation operations require around 1.1 second to execute
and generate at least 276 bytes of uncompressed data if the TPM
uses a 2048-bit RSA key and the 160-bit SHA-1 hash algorithm,
regardless of the speciﬁc protocol in use. For reference, we mea-
sured the energy consumption of a Digi XBee 802.15.4 radio using
an oscilloscope, and determined that transmitting a packet with an
x-byte payload consumed about (0.017x + 1.83) mJ of energy at
1mW.
We also evaluated a software-based attestation scheme on an At-
mel AVR32 AT32UC3A0512 microcontroller [25].
It only con-
sumes extra energy when it is active. It uses Elliptic-Curve Cryp-
tography (ECC) rather than RSA, which uses shorter keys (192 bits
in this prototype) and simpler computations. Thus, although it does
not use any hardware accelerators such as those in the TPM, it still
consumes similar amounts of energy during attestation operations.
Each operation takes about 0.6 seconds to execute. Due to the sig-
niﬁcantly shorter keys, each attestation operation only generates at
least 68 bytes of data.
6. RELATED WORK
Much of the prior work in the context of white space networks
uses various abnormality detection techniques to identify individ-
ual attackers within a cell as part of collaborative sensing. Such
approaches, however, are not capable of detecting cells that form

a majority in the cells [15, 31]. For example, Min et al.’s ap-
proach based on correlation-based ﬁlters fails to detect attackers
that constitute more than 1/3 of the population of the nodes in a
cell. Fatemieh et al. [18,19] consider detecting attacker-dominated
cells by outlier detection and classiﬁcation techniques, however,
their solutions do not consider remote attestation and fall short if a
preponderance of neighboring cells are dominated by attackers.
Another body of related work in the context of white space net-
works considers primary user emulation (PUE) attacks [16, 29]. In
a PUE, an attacker may modify the air interface of a radio to mimic
a primary transmitter signal’s characteristics, thereby causing le-
gitimate secondary users to erroneously identify the attacker as a
primary user. We consider this problem to be orthogonal to the
problem we address.
In the context of sensor networks, Wagner introduced resilient
aggregation [38], where he studies resilience of various aggrega-
tors to malicious nodes in an analytical framework based on statis-
tical estimation theory and robust statistics. However, his work is
limited to small regions and does not consider attack detection as
we do. Zhang et al. [40] propose a framework that identiﬁes read-
ings not statistically consistent with the distribution of readings in
a cluster of nearby sensors. Their proposal, however, is not able to
handle situations where attacker can compromise a large fraction of
the nodes in a cluster. Hur et al. [23] propose a trust-based frame-
work in a grid in which each sensor builds trust values for neighbors
and reports them to the local aggregator. Their solution, however,
does not consider natural uncertainties in the data, does not pro-
vide a global view for a centralized aggregator, and cannot identify
compromised ‘regions.’ For a survey on a closely related area of
secure data aggregation in wireless sensor networks see [10].
There has been a number of works on utilizing remote attesta-
tion capability to achieve security in sensor networks. For exam-
ple, there has been efforts on proposing architectures and building
platforms [35], detecting compromised nodes [39], and other activ-
ities such as secure code update and key establishment [34]. To the
best of our knowledge, no prior work has considered the problem of
using attestation to defend against malicious false reports by omni-
scient attackers in the context of white-space distributed spectrum
measurement.
Insider attacker detection in wireless networks is another area of
related work. This problem has been explored in a general set-
ting [13] as well as more speciﬁc contexts such as insider jam-
mers. As an illustrative example in the general context of sensor
networks, Liu et al. [28] propose a solution in which each node
builds a distribution of the observed measurements around it and
ﬂags deviating neighbors as insider attackers. The solution, how-
ever, is local and peer to peer and does not work in areas with more
than 25% attackers.
7. CONCLUSIONS
The use of statistical sequential estimation and classiﬁcation meth-
ods can help evaluate and improve the trustworthiness of spectrum
sensing results generated by a network containing a limited number
of attested nodes. These methods reduce the total cost incurred by
attestation. The results show that attestation capability for as low as
15% of the nodes can provide protection against more than 94% of
the attacks from omniscient coordinated attackers. The protection
improves as the fraction of attested nodes is increased. Our eval-
uation determined that the Biased node inclusion strategy is the
most effective at deterring attacks, but also generates more false
positives than Random or Geo-diverse strategies. These are not the
only strategies that can be used, and future research should evalu-
ate other strategies. One promising future direction is developing a
framework for formulating costs associated with including regular
and attested nodes, and systematically striking a balance between
the costs (from spectrum data aggregation and remote attestation)
and obtaining robust aggregation results.
