User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Setup PHP Permission under Apache what i am trying to acomplish is to have a php page execute a shell command and display the output on the web page.

the code for the page is something along the lines of 

&lt;?php
echo shell_exec('ls -l /code');
?&gt;


when i load up this page all i see is blank. yet when i execute it from the command line i see the command being executed and the output printed.

I am sure its something to do with the permissions and i am hoping someone can point me the right way.

this is what I see in the httpd log file

ls: cannot access /gateway_code: Permission denied
ls: cannot access /gateway_code: Permission denied


BTW the directory /code is set to "Read only" for the user "apache"

thanks!

Assistant: Check your base directory restriction. Php doesn't have permission to access /bin/ls. Instead of adding /bin directory to the base directory restriction list copy /bin/ls over to the folder /code.

If you really have to do this.
