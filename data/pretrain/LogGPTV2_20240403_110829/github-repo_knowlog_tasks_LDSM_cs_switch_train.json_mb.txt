When you have identified the router with the duplicate address issue the vines routing recompute command on both routers or issue the enable vines routing  command specifying specify a unique address. If one of the routers  does not support the recompute keyword disable VINES on that router  issue the write terminal command to save the configuration to memory  reboot the router and then enter the vines routing command with a unique vines address on the offending routers until each router has a unique address.\" Unless the user configures the router otherwise Cisco routers derive  VINES network addressesfrom the Banyan reserved manufacturer identifier  for Cisco and an interface MAC address. Duplicate address assignment is  rare but does occur when the least-significant 21 bits of the interface  MAC addresses are identical. Under certain circumtances such as when the second interface in line has same MAC address on both routers VINES comes up with the same address after address recomputation. This problem was corrected in CSCdi51823. If the router has only serial interfaces and does not have an interface that can provide MAC address  it uses a random number from the internal clock. If this problem occurs there is no need to submit a DDTS. Recommend that the user manually  assign a unique address or that they upgrade to a software release that includes the fix for CSCdi51823."
