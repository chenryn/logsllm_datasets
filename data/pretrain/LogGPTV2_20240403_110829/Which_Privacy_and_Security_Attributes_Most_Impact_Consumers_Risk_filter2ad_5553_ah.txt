willingness to purchase, based on qualitative responses we
propose several ways to better convey risk to consumers and
help inform their purchase behavior. Our proposed changes
should be tested in future user studies.
1) Reducing Information Uncertainty: Our qualitative ﬁnd-
ings showed that understanding the provided deﬁnitions of
attribute-values (see Appendix C) is not always enough to make
an informed decision. In Section IV-E, we mentioned several
additional pieces of information that participants thought could
help inform their decisions.
Based on these qualitative responses, we recommend that
manufacturers provide the following additional information:
• Justiﬁcation as to why the manufacturer has a speciﬁc
privacy and security practice in place.

• In what ways a speciﬁc privacy and security practice could
protect or harm consumers.
• What controls consumers have related to each privacy and
security attribute.
• If an option is being offered to control a speciﬁc privacy
and security practice, what steps users need to take to
enable that option.
It is important to note that although adding information to
the label would mitigate consumers’ uncertainty, too much in-
formation could overwhelm consumers. Therefore, we propose
adding extra information on the label in an expanded view
accessed by a plus sign that is placed next to each attribute.
Note that the expanded view is only available on the secondary
layer of the label, which is in an online-only format.
2) Placement of Information on the Label: Our quantitative
analysis suggests that the proposed distribution of attributes
between the primary and secondary layers of the label [13]
is mostly appropriate based on each attribute’s impact on risk
perception and willingness to purchase. We found that all the
primary-layer attributes we tested accurately communicated
increased or decreased risk to participants, with the exception
of purpose: device function (see Figure 1). As discussed
in Section IV-E, participants expressed a lack of trust in
manufacturers to use collected data only to enable the main
device features. However, we expect that manufacturers could
increase trust by being more explicit about the purposes for
which they use data. This explanation could be added to the
secondary layer of the label. In addition, future work should
explore whether this information is useful enough to consumers
that it is worth adding to the primary layer. For some types of
sensors/devices, this information will be fairly obvious (e.g.,
motion detector sensing motion), but for others it may be more
surprising (e.g., motion detector collecting video) and could
be helpful for consumers to see up front.
Our quantitative analysis indicated that device and cloud
retention are among the four most inﬂuential attributes to
decrease risk perception and increase willingness to purchase
the device (see Table II). Participants strongly preferred no
retention time over indeﬁnite retention. The device and cloud
retention attributes are currently placed on the secondary layer
of the label [13]. Our quantitative ﬁndings suggest that these
attributes should be promoted to the primary layer to better
inform consumers’ risk perception.
3) Reducing Misconceptions: As mentioned in Section IV-E,
open-ended responses showed that some participants had
misconceptions about the implications of patches and security
updates, believing that the need for updates or patches indicates
poor security. The root of the misconception was lack of
knowledge about the necessity of receiving security updates
and patching device vulnerabilities. We believe that an IoT
label could be an effective way not only to inform consumers’
purchase behavior, but also to educate them about privacy
and security practices. On the secondary layer of the label
in the expanded view, manufacturers can provide consumers
with explanations as to why a device needs to receive security
updates and why it needs to be patched. Besides, manufacturers
can discuss the potential consequences and risks of not having
these practices.
In our study, we tested the efﬁcacy of the attributes security
update and average time to patch. Our quantitative and
qualitative ﬁndings suggested that average time to patch was
less useful to participants, especially because they had little
knowledge of what time frame would be reasonable. This
attribute was not recommended by experts to be included on
the proposed label [13] and our results suggest that it should
not be added to the label.
B. Need for Usable Controls
The effect on usability and a desire to have control over
their device were two of the most common reasons participants
gave for being less willing to purchase a device with the most
protective attributes, such as multi-factor authentication and
automatic updates (see Section IV-E).
From the quantitative analysis, we found that having control
over three types of data practices would signiﬁcantly decrease
the perceived risk and increase the willingness to purchase
the device (see Figure 2h). Although the majority of our
participants indicated that automatic security updates would
decrease risk, this information did not impact their willingness
to purchase, mostly due to the lack of user control implied
by the factor (based on qualitative analysis). Aligned with
prior work [89], our participants preferred to know about the
details of each update before allowing installation. Although
having control was statistically favorable for some attributes,
continuously asking for users’ consent, on the other hand, could
lead to usability challenges. For instance, participants indicated
that asking the user to consent to data collection would decrease
risk, but in their open-ended responses mentioned that it would
also be a barrier to using the device (see Section IV-E).
level
Considering both usability and the desire for control, IoT
manufacturers should provide users with choices about the
control
they would like to have over their devices
and provide convenient interfaces for exercising that control.
Moreover, since the ability to control has been shown to
decrease perceived risk [90], [91], IoT manufacturers need
to clearly convey the potential risks and beneﬁts of each of
the offered choices to bridge the gap between the perceived
risks and actual risks [16], [17].
C. Risk Acceptability and Willingness to Purchase
Similar to food nutrition labels, knowing what is healthier
does not automatically translate into healthier behaviors [92].
Our ﬁndings from the two models of risk perception and
willingness to purchase indicate that privacy and security
attributes have a greater impact on risk perception than on
willingness to purchase. From the open-ended responses,
we found that participants consider multiple factors when
making purchase decisions, including price, whether it provides
functionality they need, convenience, and the desire to try
new technology. In addition, based on regression results (see
Table II), we found that participants who had the smart device
themselves were signiﬁcantly more willing to purchase a new

one of the same type (smart speaker or smart light bulb). All
these factors could lead to risk acceptability and, therefore,
lower the impact of privacy and security attributes in changing
willingness to purchase.
Our quantitative analysis showed that the tested privacy
and security attributes signiﬁcantly change participants’ risk
perception. However, an effective label should be able to
successfully impact consumers’ desire to purchase the device
as well. While our study provides some insights into the impact
on willingness to purchase, future work is needed in which
participants are provided with complete labels in a realistic
setting so that they can consider label information alongside
other purchase factors, including price, brand, and ratings.
D. On the Usefulness of Labels
Labels have been widely used to increase consumers’
awareness in various domains, including energy efﬁciency [42]
and nutrition [40]. However, the actual impact of labels on
consumers’ purchase behavior depends on various factors, some
of which are associated with the consumers themselves, while
others are related to the way information is presented on the
label. These include personal factors such as level of knowledge
and motivation in processing the label information [43], [93]–
[95]. Heike et al. found that motivation to maintain a healthy
diet and nutritional knowledge have a signiﬁcant impact on
the use of nutrition labels [43].
Food nutrition label research has shown that having prior
nutritional knowledge signiﬁcantly impacts people’s use of
nutrition labels [96]. From nutrition label research, we also
know that knowledge predicts motivation [97] and motivation
predicts knowledge [45]. In the realm of IoT, we hypothesize
that providing knowledge to some consumers through IoT labels
could initiate a virtuous cycle of knowledge and motivation,
which could impact purchase behavior. Media reports have
increased awareness among consumers about IoT devices’
privacy and security practices, which could incentivize them
to seek out more information when shopping for devices.
In addition, IoT labels would also provide information to
privacy advocates and journalists, who can then publicize this
information and help inform the public about devices that stand
out for having both exceptionally bad and exceptionally good
privacy and security attributes.
E. Path to Label Adoption
Widespread adoption of IoT privacy and security labels
would allow consumers to compare products based on their
privacy and security attributes. In addition, once a critical mass
of products have labels, consumers will look for them and may
put more trust in those products that have them.
It is unclear whether sufﬁcient incentives exist for voluntary
label adoption. If large well-known manufacturers start putting
labels on their products, smaller manufacturers may do so as
well to try to increase their trust with consumers. Retailers
could incentivize adoption by requiring manufacturers of
products they sell to label their products, or even by promoting
labeled products, for example by placing them at the top of
search results. However, it should be noted that past efforts to
encourage industry disclosure schemes [98] and standardized
privacy disclosures have faltered in the absence of regulatory
mandates [99], as manufacturers lack incentives to adopt
voluntary disclosures. In addition, manufacturers may fear
that some disclosures could reduce interest in their products
from potential customers.
Use of labels may be mandated by regulations or strongly
encouraged through “safe harbor” provisions. In the US,
law makers have proposed bills that include labels for IoT
devices [10], [11]. Outside of the US, governments have
started developing labeling schemes for IoT devices as well.
Governments of the UK [7], Finland [100], and Singapore [101]
are the forerunners in labeling their smart devices.
In addition to standardized labeling schemes, enforcement
mechanisms are needed to ensure that there are consequences
for companies that convey inaccurate information on their
labels. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission or state
attorneys general would likely prosecute companies who
make false claims on their labels, similar to what happens
when companies are found to make false claims in their
privacy policies [8], [102], [103]. In addition, privacy and
security rating or certiﬁcation programs could provide seals to
indicate they have independently veriﬁed the accuracy of label
information [62], [104]–[106].
In the US, Underwriters Laboratories (UL) is assessing the
security practices of IoT devices [77] and assigning a rating at
one of ﬁve levels [62]. As more devices undergo assessment,
these certiﬁcations may be added to IoT labels to further inform
consumers’ purchase decision making.
VI. CONCLUSION
Consumers are not aware of the privacy and security practices
of their smart devices, and this lack of knowledge could expose
them to privacy and security risks. One possible solution to
better inform consumers’ IoT device purchase decisions is to
provide privacy and security information on a label, similar to
a nutrition label for food. Little research has been done to test
the efﬁcacy of label information with IoT consumers.
We conducted an online study with 1,371 MTurk participants
to measure information efﬁcacy of 33 IoT label attribute-value
pairs along two dimensions: risk perception and willingness to
purchase. Overall, we found that label attributes successfully
conveyed risk to participants, but we also identiﬁed some
misconceptions. We found that label information more strongly
inﬂuenced participants’ risk perception than their willingness to
purchase. Based on our ﬁndings, we propose recommendations
to more effectively convey risks to IoT consumers.
