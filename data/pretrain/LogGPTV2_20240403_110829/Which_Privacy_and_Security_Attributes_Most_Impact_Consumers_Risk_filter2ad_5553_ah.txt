### Willingness to Purchase and Conveying Risk to Consumers

Based on our qualitative responses, we propose several strategies to better convey risk to consumers and inform their purchase behavior. These proposed changes should be tested in future user studies.

#### 1. Reducing Information Uncertainty
Our qualitative findings indicate that understanding the provided definitions of attribute-values (see Appendix C) is not always sufficient for making an informed decision. In Section IV-E, we identified several additional pieces of information that participants found useful.

**Recommendations:**
- **Justification for Practices:** Manufacturers should provide a rationale for their specific privacy and security practices.
- **Impact on Consumers:** Explain how these practices can protect or harm consumers.
- **Consumer Controls:** Detail the controls available to consumers related to each privacy and security attribute.
- **Enabling Options:** If an option is offered to control a specific practice, provide clear steps on how to enable it.

While adding more information can reduce uncertainty, too much information can overwhelm consumers. We suggest using an expanded view, accessible via a plus sign next to each attribute, to provide this additional information. This expanded view would be available only in the secondary layer of the label, which is in an online-only format.

#### 2. Placement of Information on the Label
Our quantitative analysis suggests that the proposed distribution of attributes between the primary and secondary layers of the label [13] is generally appropriate based on their impact on risk perception and willingness to purchase. All primary-layer attributes accurately communicated increased or decreased risk, except for "purpose: device function" (see Figure 1). Participants expressed a lack of trust in manufacturers regarding data usage. To address this, manufacturers should be more explicit about the purposes for which they use data, which could be added to the secondary layer. Future work should explore whether this information is valuable enough to include in the primary layer, especially for less obvious uses of sensors/devices.

**Key Findings:**
- **Device and Cloud Retention:** Our analysis showed that device and cloud retention are among the most influential attributes in decreasing risk perception and increasing willingness to purchase (see Table II). Participants strongly preferred no retention time over indefinite retention. Given this, these attributes should be moved to the primary layer to better inform consumers' risk perception.

#### 3. Reducing Misconceptions
Some participants had misconceptions about the implications of patches and security updates, believing that the need for updates indicates poor security. This misconception stems from a lack of knowledge about the necessity of receiving security updates and patching vulnerabilities. An IoT label can be an effective tool not only for informing purchase behavior but also for educating consumers about privacy and security practices.

**Recommendations:**
- **Explanations in Expanded View:** On the secondary layer, provide explanations for why devices need security updates and patches, and discuss the potential consequences of not having these practices.
- **Attribute Efficacy:** Our study tested the efficacy of "security update" and "average time to patch." The latter was less useful to participants due to their limited understanding of reasonable time frames. This attribute was not recommended by experts [13], and our results support its exclusion from the label.

### Need for Usable Controls
Participants frequently cited usability and the desire for control as reasons for being less willing to purchase devices with protective attributes like multi-factor authentication and automatic updates (see Section IV-E).

**Key Findings:**
- **Control Over Data Practices:** Having control over certain data practices significantly decreased perceived risk and increased willingness to purchase (see Figure 2h).
- **User Consent:** While automatic security updates were seen as reducing risk, the lack of user control reduced willingness to purchase. Participants preferred to know about update details before installation. However, continuous consent requests can lead to usability challenges.

**Recommendations:**
- **User Choices and Interfaces:** IoT manufacturers should provide users with choices about the control they want over their devices and offer convenient interfaces for exercising that control.
- **Risk Communication:** Clearly convey the potential risks and benefits of each choice to bridge the gap between perceived and actual risks [90], [91].

### Risk Acceptability and Willingness to Purchase
Similar to food nutrition labels, knowing what is healthier does not automatically translate into healthier behaviors [92]. Our findings show that privacy and security attributes have a greater impact on risk perception than on willingness to purchase. Participants consider multiple factors, including price, functionality, convenience, and the desire to try new technology. Regression results (see Table II) indicate that participants who already own smart devices are more willing to purchase similar ones.

**Key Findings:**
- **Impact on Risk Perception:** The tested privacy and security attributes significantly changed participants' risk perception.
- **Future Work:** Further research is needed to test complete labels in realistic settings, considering other purchase factors like price, brand, and ratings.

### On the Usefulness of Labels
Labels have been used to increase consumer awareness in various domains, such as energy efficiency [42] and nutrition [40]. The impact of labels on purchase behavior depends on personal factors like knowledge and motivation [43], [93]–[95]. Prior nutritional knowledge significantly impacts the use of nutrition labels [96], and motivation predicts knowledge [45].

**Hypothesis:**
- **Virtuous Cycle:** Providing knowledge through IoT labels could initiate a virtuous cycle of knowledge and motivation, impacting purchase behavior. Media reports and IoT labels can help inform the public about devices with exceptional privacy and security attributes.

### Path to Label Adoption
Widespread adoption of IoT privacy and security labels would allow consumers to compare products based on their attributes. Large manufacturers adopting labels may encourage smaller manufacturers to do the same. Retailers could incentivize adoption by promoting labeled products.

**Challenges:**
- **Voluntary Adoption:** Past efforts to encourage voluntary disclosures have faltered without regulatory mandates [98], [99].
- **Regulatory Mandates:** Regulations or safe harbor provisions may be necessary. Governments in the UK, Finland, and Singapore are developing labeling schemes for IoT devices.

**Enforcement:**
- **Consequences for Inaccuracies:** Enforcement mechanisms are needed to ensure accurate information. The Federal Trade Commission or state attorneys general could prosecute false claims. Privacy and security rating or certification programs can provide independent verification [62], [104]–[106].

### Conclusion
Consumers often lack awareness of the privacy and security practices of their smart devices, exposing them to risks. Providing privacy and security information on a label, similar to a nutrition label, is a potential solution. Our study with 1,371 MTurk participants measured the efficacy of 33 IoT label attribute-value pairs. We found that while label attributes conveyed risk effectively, they influenced risk perception more than willingness to purchase. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations to better convey risks to IoT consumers.
