(jammer) and vector signal generator (neighbor node). There is a target node
and an AP that communicate in channel 44 or channel 60 using channel hopping
in order to avoid jamming signals. They control the transmission rate using link
adaptation to mitigate channel variations and jamming eﬀects. In channel 52, a
neighbor node periodically sends packets, which are generated by a vector signal
generator. The jammer is implemented on the FPGA prototype through setting
a high level CCA threshold in order to ignore other nodes’transmissions, and the
jammer generates a jamming signal based on a jamming strategy: a reactive or
a persistent jamming scheme.
Fig. 4. Wired test: standard deviation
of device ﬁngerprints
Figure 4 presents the standard deviation of the measured ﬁngerprints in the
wired tests. When the input power was larger than 60 dBm, the standard de-
viation was less than 0.6 dB or 0.6 ppm for short distances. Small incoming
signals from 60 dBm to 90 dBm had an accuracy of less than 1.6 dB or 1 ppm
over long distances. Therefore, the digital baseband could estimate the SNR and
timing oﬀset as accurately as 1.6 dB and 1 ppm using preambles in the physical

layer header for the full dynamic range. The SNR-based ﬁngerprinting method
is particularly eﬀective for indoor channels because it is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected
by multipath propagation. Furthermore, the accuracy is generally adequate for
most indoor wireless applications but could be reduced through temporary phys-
ical obstructions or deviations in the radiation pattern of the target device. In
low input power regions, the timing oﬀset-based ﬁngerprinting method has the
potential to achieve higher accuracy than the SNR-based ﬁngerprint method
because the SNR and EVM are inﬂuenced more by various noise sources at the
receiver in low input power regions.
Figure 5(a) depicts the experimental setup used to measure the detection suc-
cess ratio of the PAID and ﬁngerprints in wireless conditions. We measured the
standard deviation of the SNR and timing oﬀset in wired and wireless conditions.
First, we tested the standard deviation in wired conditions using RF coaxial ca-
bles and RF attenuators. The VSG transmitted signals with an 8 ppm timing
oﬀset and various power levels from the vector signal generator, and the jammer
measured the timing oﬀset and SNR based on the received preambles. A Lite-
point IQxel vector signal generator was used to create all packets, which were
modulated and coded using MCS0 (BPSK and R = 1/2) and were transmitted
in the 40 MHz bandwidth. The wired test enabled full control of the channel
conditions and precise control while monitoring the results. Then, we performed
a wireless test at diﬀerent locations. We measured the detection success ratio in
ﬁve diﬀerent locations in order to include various wireless indoor channel and
interference eﬀects. The proposed jammer was located where the packet delivery
ratio (PDR) and detection success ratio (DSR) of the PAID and device ﬁnger-
prints on the SNR and timing oﬀset could be measured. Locations 1 and 2 had
line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, while Locations 3, 4, and 5 had non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) conditions. The ﬁngerprints were measured in root mean square (RMS)
values and the standard deviation of over 100 packets.
As shown in Figure 5(b), we also measured the detection success ratio of the
transmitted packet from diﬀerent wireless conditions. The results demonstrated
that the ID detection success ratio was higher than 90% for all locations, and
the ﬁngerprint detection success ratio was higher than 80% for all locations. The
ﬁngerprint detection performance was also related to the detection threshold.

Fig. 6. (a) A throughput measurement at target node for jamming attack reactive
jammr (upper), and persistent jammer (lower), and (b) jamming eﬃcacy: throughput
vs. speed and power
Two thresholds were used: Threshold 1 (TR1) had a 2 dB SNR and 1 ppm
timing oﬀset threshold, and Threshold 2 (TR2) had a 4 dB SNR and 2 ppm
timing oﬀset threshold. We observed that there was a trade-oﬀ related to the
threshold between the detection success ratio and false positive detection ratio.
If the threshold was large, the persistent jammer’s detection was more frequent.
However, the false positive detection probability also increased. In contrast, if
the threshold was small, the misdetection probability was higher. The TR1 and
TR2 were selected as optimal threshold sets for accurate detection and fast
detection in order to cover the full dynamic range of the WLAN, respectively. A
fundamental limitation of the accuracy that could be attained when measuring
ﬁngerprints resulted from the random noise and fading eﬀects. However, if the
distorted packet was ﬁltered and adjusted by EVM and timing oﬀset from pilots
at the receiver, the SNR and timing oﬀset measurement directly reﬂect the signal
quality determined using a unique device. Furthermore, the PHY-based ID and
ﬁngerprint detection was faster than MAC-based schemes.
We compared the jamming eﬀectiveness of the persistent jamming attack with
a reactive jamming attack through observing the throughput at the target node.
As shown in Figure 6(a), the reactive jammer succeeded in its ﬁrst attack on
the target node within approximately 65 seconds (above) and 45 seconds (be-
low). After the target node switched to a diﬀerent channel, the reactive jammer
could not attack it because the reactive jammer attacked channel 52 rather than
channel 60. In contrast, the persistent jammer switched to the target device’s
channels. As a result, the measured throughput was continuously degraded even
though the target node switched channels. In order to evaluate the eﬃcacy of
the jamming schemes over the attacker’s capability, diﬀerent response times and
transmit powers were used as described in Table 1. In this table, (x,y) refers to
the condition with x second response time (RT ) and y dBm transmit power (TP ).
The reactive jammer used only the fastest response time and largest transmit
power in order to obtain the best performance, while the persistent jammer had
various response times and transmit powers for comparison with the reactive
jammer.

Figure 6(b) presents the eﬀective throughput over the condition index from
Table 1, as a function of the jamming speed and transmission power for reactive
and persistent jammers. The results indicate that reactive jamming is signiﬁ-
cantly less eﬀective than persistent jamming, which can signiﬁcantly reduce the
throughput of the target node in dense network conditions. The reactive jammer
could not improve the jamming eﬃcacy in the communication link even though
it had the fastest response time and highest transmit power, while the persistent
jammer could improve as the speed and power increased. As we presented in Sec-
tion 2.1, due to the ineﬃciency and complexity, Wi-Fi devices use the reactive
channel hopping schemes or passive-type channel switching scheme instead of the
proactive channel hopping schemes. Therefore, in the current WLAN technolo-
gies, the target nodes change their channel frequencies slowly when link quality
is degraded statistically. If we assume that target Wi-Fi devices can switch the
channel very fast, channel scanning speed is important for persistent jamming
attack. The jamming speed including channel scanning time and detection pro-
cessing time is related to the jamming eﬃcacy. The test results indicate that
jamming eﬃcacy could be improved as jamming speed is faster. Regarding the
channel scanning time, there are three orthogonal channels in 2.4 GHz ISM and
19 channels in 5 GHz ISM band in 20 MHz channel unit. Therefore, it is possible
to detect the target node when the attacker switches at most 5 times for full
channel scanning because IEEE 802.11ac supports 80 MHz band operation.

4.2 Large-scale Emulation
Experimental Setup. In the developed prototype, it is diﬃcult to evaluate
the system in dense network conditions because it is necessary to have numer-
ous hardware and software resources or expensive equipment. In order to over-
come such problems, a software-based emulation environment can reduce the
evaluation cost and experimental setup time. Therefore, the hardware behavior
and performance can be emulated in the developed emulator. The hardware is
manufactured using a hardware description language (HDL) in order to perform
synthesis, place, and routing with various tools. Our FPGA prototype system
was initially developed to be veriﬁed using a hardware-like C emulator. The em-
ulator has been described with hardware architecture, and it has a cycle-true
and bit-true description. That is, the emulator is programmed like a register

transistor level (RTL) description model, and it has timing and bit widths for
all signals. This emulator was veriﬁed using a bit-matching process between the
RTL and C model. The emulation performance curves are the same as the per-
formance measurement results on the RTL targeted FPGA prototype system.
In this way, we developed an emulation model that evaluates attack methods in
dense networks.
Figure 7 presents the emulation model used to analyze the jamming eﬀect in
dense network conditions. The emulation model consisted of two Wi-Fi models
for the sender and receiver, a channel model, a jammer model, and a dynamic
spectrum congestion model. The Wi-Fi model had the same function and perfor-
mance as the developed commercial hardware design. The channel model was de-
veloped with the IEEE 802.11 recommended channel model including RF/analog
impairments. The dynamic spectrum congestion model randomly generated traf-
ﬁc from multiple nodes in the network. The jamming model could support one
jamming strategy among the random, reactive, and persistent strategies. The
target Wi-Fi model could mitigate the jamming eﬀect and channel variation
using channel hopping and link adaptation. This emulation model enabled the
investigation of the jamming impact in dense network conditions.
There were three models in the simulation model: two Wi-Fi models for one
AP and one station, and an interferer model for adjacent channel interference
(ACI) or co-channel interference (CCI), which is generated using a jamming
model and dynamic spectrum congestion model. The impairments that are ana-
lyzed include the multipath channel, mismatch between the in-phase and quadra-
ture phase, carrier phase noise, carrier frequency oﬀset, sampling phase noise,
sampling frequency oﬀset, signal amplitude variation, and adjacent channel inter-
ference variation. The channel models were modeled to have realistic RF/analog
and wireless channel impairments. We applied a 50 ns root mean square (RMS)
delay spread channel model. The channel model included a RAPP power ampli-
ﬁer with a 10 dB backoﬀ. The phase noise was 104 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz, which
was generated using the pole-zero model. The impairment model had a residual

frequency error that is caused by oscillators with 8 ppm stability at the legiti-
mate transmitter and receiver. Because the RF PLL and ADC clock use the same
oscillator, the timing oﬀset introduced by the ADC was 8 ppm. For simplicity of
jamming eﬃcacy comparison, we assumed that the packet size was 1,000 bytes
and the packet interval was 16 µs. The SNR and signal-to-interference ratio
varied randomly for every packet.
Figure 7 also presents the MAC model, which consists of a TX, RX, error
counter, scheduler, power control unit (PCU), and link controller. In order to
simulate the proposed scheme in a dynamically varying channel, a link adapta-
tion scheme should be considered. The link adaptation algorithms are grouped
into two classes: auto rate fallback (ARF) and SNR-based rate control [22, 31].
The ARF is a statistic-based scheme that has a slow response but simple imple-
mentation, whereas the SNR-based rate control is fast and uses the SNR as a
good link quality indicator. However, the optimal rate and SNR are not corre-
lated in certain link conditions. In this emulation, the combined scheme of ARF
and SNR-based link adaptation was used as the jamming schemes. The link
adaptation scheme is operated as an SNR-guided rate adaptation scheme [31] in
order to manage the high ﬂuctuations of the SNR, and it adjusts the transmis-
