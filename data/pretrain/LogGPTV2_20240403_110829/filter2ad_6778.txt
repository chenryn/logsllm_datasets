Message from the Conference Coordinator 
I would like to join the other members of the Conference Organizing Committee in welcoming you 
to the 2006 International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks, the leading international conference on 
dependability.   As  society  becomes  ever  more  dependent  on  computer  systems  and  the  consequences  of  failures 
become more severe, the topics being considered at the conference continue to become more relevant and important. 
As  Conference  Coordinator,  my  primary  responsibility  is  for  the  overall  technical  program  of  the  conference, 
coordinating the activities of those responsible for the Dependable Computing and Communication Symposium, the 
Performance  and  Dependability  Symposium,  the  student  forum,  the  workshops,  the  industry  sessions,  and  fast 
abstracts.  Most of the hard work is done by the individuals responsible for those areas, so I would like to thank the 
individuals responsible for those parts of the technical program:  Lorenzo Alvisi, Aad Van Moorsel, Chrisof Fetzer, 
Neeraj Suri, Lisa Spainhower, and Saurabh Bagchi, as well as those organizing the individual workshops.  I would 
especially  like  to  thank  Lorenzo  and  Aad,  who  had  very  large  tasks  as  the  two  PC  chairs,  in  handling  paper 
submission, reviewing (including the nagging of reviewers where required), and management of the PC meetings.  
They have each made a very large contribution to the fine quality of the technical program. 
I  am  sure  everyone  attending  the  conference  will  find  much  of  value  and  interest.   It  is  a  major  challenge  to 
assemble all the components of the program in a way that minimizes conflict.  My apologies to those who find two 
(or three) concurrent sessions that are of interest.  I have attempted to keep such situations to a minimum, but with 
so much fine material to assemble into a four-track program, some conflicts are inevitable. 
Thank you for choosing to attend the conference.  I hope you find the technical program and all other aspects of the 
conference useful and that you enjoy your stay in Philadelphia.
