User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Cannot Login as root At my work we ship our product on pre-installed servers as a software/hardware package.  We are using open SUSE 10.3 for the OS and we setup and we always log in with the root user to do maintenance on the box.  Recently we just had box returned to us that the customer said the could not longer connect to the box through the network interface.  So when I started to work on the box I run into the this problem:  At the command prompt to login i type the user name "root" and hit enter.  Then even before it asks me for a password I get "Login incorrect".  

I have never seen this behavior before and could not find any information about it online.  Does anybody know what is going on?

Thanks.

Assistant: Check your /var/log/auth.log against failed root login.
You might find out something similar to these:

Dec 30 07:31:51 vps login[18093]: (pam_securetty) access denied: tty 'hvc0' is not secure !
Dec 30 07:31:51 vps login[18093]: FAILED LOGIN (1) on 'hvc0' FOR `root', Authentication failure

In modern systems there are lots of new technologies used, and for example XenServer virtualized instance might have console as hvc0.

This can be fixed by including that console into /etc/securetty.
Just type: echo hvc0 >> /etc/securetty &amp;&amp; kill -1 1
Then try login again.
