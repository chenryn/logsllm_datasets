### Introduction

This book delves into the concept of the attacker mindset (AMs) and includes chapters on open source intelligence (OSINT) and social engineering. While other resources exist that detail how to perform OSINT and become a social engineer, my goal is to show how these skills fit into the AMs’s executive functions.

#### Who Is This Book For?

The attacker mindset should be taught to those who need it most—those we, as a society, aim to protect from malicious attackers. Companies should regularly use both physical and network testing to evaluate their security postures, which will help build intuition and security among their employees. The AMs should be employed in boardrooms, government, and corporate settings to scrutinize and analyze blind spots and vulnerabilities. Members of the cyber and information security communities should be consulted as think tanks and task forces. Therefore, this book is intended for decision-makers in these areas.

However, because I will examine the AMs through the lens of a security professional, this book is primarily aimed at those who wish to engage in the modern battle of stress testing and ethics: security professionals. Ethics and morals play a significant role. Understanding how to portray bad actors is not the same as becoming them. The line that separates us from them is the line of ethics.

There is also a case to be made that ordinary individuals can benefit from learning about the AMs. Awareness of how this mindset might present itself can be crucial in assessing whether an attack is being mounted against you and what to do if it is. Thus, my aim for *The Art of Attack* is for it to be useful for the general public as well.

Finally, every chapter, paragraph, and sentence in this book has the potential to offend or irritate someone. Those with a detailed military background will need patience to forgive what cannot be known about warfare recon without firsthand experience; those in the ethical hacking community will need to find a way to manage their frustration, given that this book speaks directly to both ethical and malicious attackers. I cannot control who reads this book and what they do with the information. For those very sensitive or pedantic, adding the word "ethical" before "attacker" will not make the content invisible to malicious actors. To address this, I offer this: as a society increasingly in need of effective security measures, focusing on understanding attacks and attackers is prudent. Understanding how and why an attacker performs is important, but being able to think like them and view ourselves through their eyes makes us more powerful, dominant, and safer.

My final sentiments echo Tai T’ung, who, in the 13th century, said of his book, *History of Chinese Writing*: “Were I to wait for perfection, my book would never be finished.” I am not writing a history of the attacker mindset; rather, I aim to show its full breadth and its modern-day uses and functions.

#### What This Book Covers

- **Documenting and Teaching the Attacker Mindset:** The primary idea behind this book is to document and teach the attacker mindset without erasing individualism.
- **Different Strengths and Commonalities:** Different strengths will be required by all who use this book to build an attacker mindset and execute attacks. I will break down the attacker mindset to find commonalities while leaving room for personal application.
- **Opportunities and Adaptability:** The greatest and sharpest attackers are trained to see opportunities in the moment. This book will teach how to form the attacker mindset and apply it, though it cannot list all possible opportunities an attacker might encounter.
- **Ethics and Protection:** In the name of ethics, the final part of this book will explore the "tells" of an attack and what businesses, organizations, and institutions can and should do pre- and post-attack to protect themselves.
- **Final Goal:** The ultimate goal of the attack, after all the preparation and execution, is to leave each company, boardroom, and client stronger for having employed you. This is almost all that separates us from the bad guys.

Let's begin. Enjoy.

### Part I: The Attacker Mindset

#### Chapter 1: What Is the Attacker Mindset?

**War is 90 percent information.**
—Napoleon Bonaparte

It is 5 a.m., and I still have an hour before I meet my team. I’ve been up for the last hour going over plans because this is how I always start my attacks: with a niggling amount of nervous energy, I pace the floor of my hotel room, playing a game of mental chess in my mind. I go over my initial approach, consider my possible moves if I do get past security, and then again if I don’t, I start to wonder, "How will I pivot?" The game of mental chess carries on. This is the most efficient and successful way I have found to hone my mental agility.

From this thought, I dive into a myriad of others, imagining new ways I might get into the building, new ways to escalate my privileges and deepen my foothold after my initial breach, whether that starts in the basement or the lobby. If someone happens to ask me why I am in the basement, could I say I got in the wrong elevator from the parking garage and ask for help...?

I visualize the layout of the building internally—another luxury afforded by solid open source intelligence (OSINT) findings—and use faceless silhouettes to represent staff I might pass along the way. Sometimes I imagine them asking me questions; sometimes I imagine myself just nodding at them in silent acknowledgment. After all, the largest component of executing an artful attack lies in the attacker’s ability to adapt to the people and surroundings in which they find themselves, even when those things are brand-new.

I continue to walk myself through it all a few times, picturing different obstacles: "Would it be better just to tailgate, or should I walk in front of the building declaring myself a visitor?" I imagine the payoffs of each and weigh them. "Working the visitor system should give me almost unfettered access for the day, but it’s a high-risk move," I tell myself, whereas "tailgating in through a less visible entrance leaves me at the mercy of sloppy, albeit well-intentioned, employees holding any one of hundreds of fire and security doors open for me..." Taking a moment, I come to a conclusion: "No, stick with the A-plan: go to security and get access," I tell myself.

Throughout this mental pre-attack ritual, I remind myself of the same things over and over: get in, get the flags, never let them know you’re a threat, and stay within scope. In my mind, I am always making my way to the 38th floor, and I am always mentally preempting the challenges I’ll face as I try to walk into the CFO’s office and place a USB drive into their computer port. That’s my job. And, although I like to warm up by running as many possibilities through my mind as I can come up with, I have yet to predict obstacles and pivots correctly even once in my career. That is irrelevant, though—the mental warm-up is what I need—it induces the power of thinking on my feet and knowing I’ve learned from prior failures and successes.

I soon start to focus on making sure I’ve disguised myself as a non-threat. I’ve based my pretext off the OSINT I’ve found so far. For this bank job, I am a lawyer here to help wrap up the mergers and acquisitions deal that was all over the news only weeks ago, albeit without much context. It took a lot of searches and piecing together information to choose the nuance of this pretext; I am not just any lawyer, but a lawyer who is now needed to help the deal over the final few hurdles, equipped with an abundance of paperwork—my prop and my seeming legitimacy. And, unless the security guards happen to be a team of lawyers, I won’t be found out by the typical questions people ask a lawyer: "What are you here for? What firm do you work for? How long have you been practicing, what school did you go to? Do you know how I can get out of a parking ticket?" I call these my "pretext layers," and depending on the job, I might need to go many layers deep, to the point where I need to know much more than you might expect, from common jargon to how a piece of machinery works.

The start point of the operation is as hermetic as it’s ever going to be. I have my props, which in this case are an ID card from my "firm" and a portfolio filled with "legal documents," categorized by tabs that have the words "Signed by [CFO’s name]" and today’s date. I also have a fake guest pass card that one of my teammates was able to print for me based on a picture of a legitimate one we’d found on Yelp. Blessed be Yelp. I have lock picks; I have my radio-frequency identification (RFID) duplicator and fobs just in case the opportunity arises to clone a working security card I can’t slip into my pocket; and I have the most important thing I’ll carry all day: my letter of approval. It is a piece of paper with my point of contact’s name and number and a short statement asking anyone who detains me to contact him before the police. I also have my fake ID, although I am sans a snack, which is unlike me. The snack is not important. Yet.

With another huge thanks to mighty OSINT, I’ve already prepared my outfit for the day, too. I’ve had it picked out for about a week now, and it will be a big part of the operation. I’ve chosen it with meticulous care to be professional and versatile. This is not a job where I can wear a costume. I won’t be going head-to-toe in scrubs or coveralls, like in some of my other jobs. I put on my wardrobe for the day with a sense of gravity and focus that I generally don’t use for throwing on my usual working-from-home attire (sweats on the bottom, work-acceptable T-shirt on top). It is the middle of summer in New York, yet I have on a long-sleeved blue shirt under a white silk shirt, but for a good reason. There is a chance I’ll need to ditch the top layer so that the security team can’t quickly identify me by the color of my clothes, should someone start to become suspicious. I have a hairband tied around my wrist, too, to throw my hair up in case I need to hide its length and color. I’ve put foundation on the rather unfortunate tattoo I have on my right thumb. I’ll be returning to this office soon enough, and I don’t want anything about me to be too recognizable. These seemingly inconsequential things matter.

Finally, dressed and mentally prepared, I leave the room to meet my team. They won’t be joining me, but they will be on standby in case of trouble, which is a company policy and one I’ve been thankful for on more than one occasion. After a pep talk, making sure we can stay in constant communication, I make my way to the bank’s offices and try to break in, knowing that if it all goes well, I’ll be out in time to do it a second time under the cover of darkness. I’ll need my team for that and a few more games of mental chess.

#### Using the Mindset

The attacker mindset (AMs) is a set of cognitive skills applied to four laws. It is evident and relevant across all professions, trades, and businesses, although it often goes under the guise of expertise. Many people exhibit AMs qualities within their domain, as we will look at shortly. *The Art of Attack*, however, is about gaining and using this mindset for malicious activity over any domain—but in a way that ultimately results in the betterment of an organization’s security.

The laws state that you must know your end goal, be able to constantly collect information that you can weaponize and leverage to achieve that goal, develop a pretext that you never let slip, and have every action you take be for the advancement of the objective. As you will see, the cognitive skills needed to uphold these laws in an attack are broad, but they all have a single common thread: they relate to information, and most importantly, information as you perceive it. There is no attack without information, and learning to tie it back to your objective is the essence of AMs.

A woman spills coffee on herself, and it burns her. We hear, "Someone had butterfingers," and comprehend hot liquids scald. A lawyer hears "The coffee was too hot" and the winds of a lawsuit. This particular woman’s lawyer took facts and bent them and shaped them to fit the objective set out by the law. This is what the attacker mindset looks like at work. Your attacker mindset will differ from that of a lawyer’s, but the central principles remain: the building of an attack is based on information as you perceive it; the execution is based on the information as you apply it. AMs is nothing more or less than a way of taking information in and applying it to an objective. The mark of a good attacker is the ability to repurpose information in ways not intended by the source. This is made possible by using the first and second laws of the attacker mindset: the first law states that you start with the end in mind, and the second law states that you gather, weaponize, and leverage information as a means to that end.

As an example, if you hear of a company holding a conference, you may be able to phish them by gathering information on who their vendors are and impersonating those vendors by way of vishing (a call in which an attacker attempts to gain information or perform an attack), phishing (an email in which an attacker aims to gain information or gain access to a user’s machine/network), or even in person to gain sensitive details or access. If they are holding the event virtually, a well-crafted phish will have a high probability of being undetected. You might start by finding out which platform they are holding the event on and phishing them, pretending to be that platform. You might be able to phish their attendees or their speakers, appearing as if you are in fact reaching out from the hosting company itself, gaining access to potentially thousands of people’s sensitive data. Most people’s reaction to that possibility is that this sort of attack would be illegal. This is actually up for debate, depending on where in the world you live. Some governments can authorize this sort of test if you have a bank account in that country, for example. Typically, though, it will be a company that hires you, and you will not be able to test their attendees.

Let’s look at another example of how this mindset can take seemingly innocuous information—in this case given by the source—and use it to create a vulnerability. Say you are able to circumvent a company’s technical defenses upon searching current or historical job postings. In this example, a company was looking for a candidate who had "an overview or understanding of SAP product and service portfolio (SAP Cloud Platform Integration, SAP PI/PO, API Management)." They were also looking for that person to have "sound knowledge of JavaScript and Groovy Script. [Be] able to configure Sound NetWeaver. Should be comfortable with Java Programming. Nice to have worked in UI developments using SAP Web IDE #."

There’s a lot of information in this that could prove vital in various attacks against this target, including network, web app, phishing, and vishing attacks.

- **Network Attack:** An attempt to gain unauthorized access to the target’s network, with the objective of stealing data or performing other malicious activity. Thanks to this job posting, I know that the target uses systems applications and products (SAP) systems, which are tempting to perform an attack on because they store and manage the lifeblood of any organization: critical information and business processes. SAP systems can be based on different platforms: ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming), Java, or HANA. We can assume this is based on Java, given the job description. The main SAP platform is SAP NetWeaver, and ExploitDB (www.exploit-db.com)—a popular website repository—shows that vulnerabilities exist for version 7.4, one of which showed that SQL injections are possible. This type of attack allows attackers to inject their own evil SQL commands, creating requests and paving the way for access to critical data in a database of users’ passwords, account information, and anything else stored in the database.
- **Vishing:** A simple vish could be made with this knowledge to multiple departments in the organization to gain more information based on these findings or to weaponize this information immediately to attempt to gain forgotten credentials. You may be able to gain entry to a secure building upon learning of an upcoming event they are holding and vishing to find out which type of ID is required to enter. If it’s their work badge, you may be able to find a clear enough picture online to re-create one. You may be able to circumvent a whole building’s security team by finding out what time the guards change shifts.

The possibilities are truly endless when you have information, and you can weaponize it and leverage it correctly. All of this neatly brings us to the cognitive skills an attacker must exhibit: an attacker must have curiosity in abundance; persistence to drive that curiosity into action so as to be moving forward all the time; the ability to process information into workable categories; mental agility to adapt and pivot; and, most importantly, the ability to tie all information back to the objective.
