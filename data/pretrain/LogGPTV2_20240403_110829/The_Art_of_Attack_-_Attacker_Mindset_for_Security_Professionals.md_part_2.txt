think. It contains chapters on open source intelligence (oSInT) and
social engineering, too. However, other books and courses exist that
Introduction xvii
break down how to perform oSInT and how to become a social
engineer (SE). My aim is to show you how those fit into the AMs’s
executive functions.
Who Is This Book For?
The attacker mindset should be taught to those who need it most—
those who we, as a society, want to protect from malicious attackers.
companies should use physical testing as well as network testing
to evaluate their security postures regularly, which will help build
their populations’ intuition and security. The attacker mindset
should be used in boardrooms and other government and corporate
settings as a way to scrutinize and analyze blind spots and vulner-
abilities. Members of the cyber and information security communi-
ties should be consulted as think tanks and task forces. So, my aim
is for this book to speak to those decision makers as well.
However, because I will look at the attacker mindset through
the lens of a security professional, this book is first and foremost
intended for those who wish to partake in a modern battle of stress
testing and ethics: security professionals. Ethics and morals will
come into play quite a bit. Knowing how to portray the bad actors is
not the same as actually becoming them. The line that separates us
from them is the line of ethics.
There’s also a case to be made that says ordinary individuals
can benefit from learning about AMs. Awareness of how this mind-
set might present itself can prove pivotal in assessing whether an
attack is being mounted against you and what to do if it is. Because
of this, my aim for The­Art­of­Attack is for it to be useful for the gen-
eral public, too.
Finally, every chapter in this book, every paragraph, every
sentence, has the capacity to offend or irk someone. Those with a
detailed military background will need all of their patience to forgive
what cannot be known about warfare recon without having been in
the thick of it; those who guard the realm of the ethical hacker will
need to find a way to subside their rage given this book speaks as
xviii InTroduc TIon
directly to malicious attackers as it does ethical. Alas, I cannot con-
trol who reads this and what they do with the information within it.
For those very sensitive or pedantic, putting the word ethical before
the word attacker will not make what I say in this book invisible to
any malicious actors reading it. To subside this rage, all I can offer
is this: as a society increasingly in need of effective security meas-
ures, focusing on the need to better understand attacks and attack-
ers is prudent. understanding how and why an attacker performs
is one thing—a nd it’s important. But being able to think like them,
looking at ourselves through their eyes, we become more powerful,
more dominant, and far safer.
My final sentiments are a cloned copy of Tai T’ung, who, in the
13th century said of his book, History­of­Chinese­Writing: “Were I to
wait perfection, my book would never be finished.” of course, I am
not writing a history of the attacker mindset. I am setting out to
show the full breadth of it and its modern- day uses and functions.
What This Book Covers
• The idea behind this book is to document and teach the attacker
mindset, without taking individualism and obliterating it.
• different strengths will have to be played to by all of us who
use this book to build an attacker mindset and execute attacks.
nonetheless, I’ll pick apart the attacker mindset so that we can
find the commonalties and still leave room for each of us to
apply our own personal brand to it.
• The greatest and sharpest attackers are trained to see opportu-
nities in the moment, and there’s no way for this book to list the
infinite opportunities an (ethical or otherwise) attacker might
come across out in the field. But what it will teach is this: how
to form the attacker mindset and how to apply it.
• In the name of ethics, the final part of this book will explore
the “tells” of an attack and what businesses, organizations, and
institutions can and should do pre- and post- attack to protect
themselves.
Introduction xix
• Finally, the end goal of the attack, after you’ve sprinted 18
flights of stairs, hidden under desks, been wedged in between
two 20-f oot containers, sweated the foundation off your thumb
tattoos (all fun stories for later), and handed in the report, is to
leave each company, boardroom, and client stronger for having
employed you. It’s almost all that separates us from the bad guys.
Here we go. Enjoy.

t is 5 a.m., and I still have an hour before I meet my team. I’ve
been up for the last hour going over plans because this is how
I always start my attacks: with a niggling amount of nervous
energy, I pace the floor of my hotel room, playing a game of mental
chess in my mind. I go over my initial approach, consider my pos-
sible moves if I do get past security, and then again if I don’t, I start
to wonder How­will­I­pivot? The game of mental chess carries on.
This is the most efficient and successful way I have found to hone
my mental agility.
From this thought I dive into a myriad of others, imagining new
ways I might get into the building, new ways to escalate my privi-
leges and deepen my foothold after my initial breach, whether that
starts in the basement or the lobby. If­someone­happens­to­ask­me­

4 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
I visualize the layout of the building internally—a nother luxury
afforded by solid open source intelligence (OSINT) findings—a nd
use faceless silhouettes to represent staff I might pass along the way.
Sometimes I imagine them asking me questions; sometimes I imag-
ine myself just nodding at them in silent acknowledgment. After
all, the largest component of executing an artful attack lies in the
attacker’s ability to adapt to the people and surroundings in which
they find themselves, even when those things are brand-n ew.
I continue to walk myself through it all a few times, picturing
different obstacles: Would­it­be­better­just­to­tailgate,­or­should­I­walk­
in­front­of­the­building­declaring­myself­a­visitor? I imagine the pay-
offs of each and weigh them. Working­the­visitor­system­should­give­

a moment, I come to a conclusion: No,­stick­with­the­A-­plan:­go­to­
security­and­get­access, I tell myself.
The whole time I’m performing this mental pre-a ttack ritual,
I am reminding myself of the same things over and over: get in,
get the flags, never let them know you’re a threat, and stay within
scope. In my mind I am always making my way to the 38th floor,
and I am always mentally preempting the challenges I’ll face as I try
to walk into the CFO’s office and place a USB drive into their com-
puter port. That’s my job. And, although I like to warm up by run-
ning as many possibilities through my mind as I can come up with,
I have yet to predict obstacles and pivots correctly even once in my
career. That is irrelevant, though—t he mental warm- up is what I
need— it induces the power of thinking on my feet and knowing
I’ve learned from prior failures and successes.
I soon start to focus on making sure I’ve disguised myself as a
threat. I’ve based my pretext off the OSINT I’ve found so far. For
this bank job, I am a lawyer here to help wrap up the mergers and
acquisitions deal that was all over the news only weeks ago, albeit
without much context. It took a lot of searches and piecing together
information to choose the nuance of this pretext; I am not just any
What Is the Attacker Mindset? 5
lawyer, but a lawyer who is now needed to help the deal over the
final few hurdles, equipped with an abundance of paperwork—m y
prop and my seeming legitimacy. And, unless the security guards
happen to be a team of lawyers, I won’t be found out by the typical
questions people ask a lawyer: What­are­you­here­for?­What­firm­do­
you­work­for?­How­long­have­you­been­practicing,­what­school­did­you­
go­to?­Do­you­know­how­I­can­get­out­of­a­parking­ticket? I call these
my pretext­layers, and depending on the job, I might need to go many
layers deep, to the point I need to know much more than you might
expect, from common jargon to how a piece of machinery works.
The start point of the operation is as hermetic as it’s ever going
to be. I have my props, which in this case are an ID card from my
“firm” and a portfolio filled with “legal documents,” categorized
by tabs that have the words “Signed by [CFO’s name]” and today’s
date. I also have a fake guest pass card that one of my teammates
was able to print for me based on a picture of a legitimate one we’d
found on Yelp. Blessed be Yelp. I have lock picks; I have my radio-
frequency identification (RFID) duplicator and fobs just in case the
opportunity arises to clone a working security card I can’t slip into
my pocket; and I have the most important thing I’ll carry all day:
my letter of approval. It is a piece of paper with my point of con-
tact’s name and number and a short statement asking anyone who
detains me to contact him before the police. I also have my fake ID,
although I am sans a snack, which is unlike me. The snack is not
important. Yet.
With another huge thanks to mighty OSINT, I’ve already pre-
pared my outfit for the day, too. I’ve had it picked out for about a
week now, and it will be a big part of the operation. I’ve chosen it
with meticulous care to be professional and versatile. This is not a job
where I can wear a costume. I won’t be going head-t o-t oe in scrubs
or coveralls, like in some of my other jobs. I put on my wardrobe for
the day with a sense of gravity and focus that I generally don’t use
for throwing on my usual working-f rom-h ome attire (sweats on the
bottom, work-a cceptable T- shirt on top). It is the middle of summer
in New York, yet I have on a long- sleeved blue shirt under a white
silk shirt, but for a good reason. There is a chance I’ll need to ditch
6 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
the top layer so that the security team can’t quickly identify me by
the color of my clothes, should someone start to become suspicious.
I have a hairband tied around my wrist, too, to throw my hair up in
case I need to hide its length and color. I’ve put foundation on the
rather unfortunate tattoo I have on my right thumb. I’ll be returning
to this office soon enough, and I don’t want anything about me to
be too recognizable. These seemingly inconsequential things matter.
Finally, dressed and mentally prepared, I leave the room to meet
my team. They won’t be joining me, but they will be on standby in
case of trouble, which is a company policy and one I’ve been thank-
ful for on more than one occasion. After a pep talk, making sure we
can stay in constant communication, I make my way to the bank’s
offices and try to break in, knowing that if it all goes well, I’ll be out
in time to do it a second time under the cover of darkness. I’ll need
my team for that and a few more games of mental chess.
Using the Mindset
The attacker­mindset (AMs) is a set of cognitive skills applied to four
laws. It is evident and relevant across all professions, trades, and
businesses, although it often goes under the guise of expertise. Many
people exhibit AMs qualities within their domain, as we will look at
shortly. The­Art­of­Attack, however, is about gaining and using this
mindset for malicious activity over any domain—b ut in a way that
ultimately results in the betterment of an organization’s security.
The laws say that you must know your end goal, be able to con-
stantly collect information that you can weaponize and leverage to
achieve that goal, develop a pretext that you never let slip, and have
every action you take be for the advancement of the objective. As
you will see, the cognitive skills needed to uphold these laws in an
attack are broad, but they all have a single common thread: they
relate to information, and most importantly, information as you
perceive it. There is no attack without information, and learning to
tie it back to your objective is the essence of AMs.
A woman spills coffee on herself, and it burns her. We hear,
“Someone had butterfingers,” and comprehend hot liquids scald.
What Is the Attacker Mindset? 7
A lawyer hears “The coffee was too hot” and the winds of a law-
suit. This particular woman’s lawyer took facts and bent them and
shaped them to fit the objective set out by the law. This is what the
attacker mindset looks like at work. Your attacker mindset will dif-
fer from that of a lawyer’s, but the central principles remain: the
building of an attack is based on information as you perceive it;
the execution is based on the information as you apply it. AMs is
nothing more or less than a way of taking information in and apply-
ing it to an objective. The mark of a good attacker is the ability to
repurpose information in ways not intended by the source. This is
made possible by using the first and second laws of the attacker
mindset: the first law states that you start with the end in mind,
and the second law states that you gather, weaponize, and leverage
information as a means to that end.
As an example, if you hear of a company holding a conference,
you may be able to phish them by gathering information on who
their vendors are and impersonating those vendors by way of vish
(a call in which an attacker attempts to gain information or per-
form an attack), phish (an email in whch an attacker aims to gain
information or gain access to a user’s machine/network), or even
in person to gain sensitive details or access. If they are holding the
event virtually, a well- crafted phish will have a high probability of
being undetected. You might start by finding out which platform
they are holding the event on and phishing them, pretending to be
that platform. You might be able to phish their attendees or their
speakers, appearing as if you are in fact reaching out from the host-
ing company itself, gaining access to potentially thousands of peo-
ple’s sensitive data. Most people’s reaction to that possibility is that
this sort of attack would be illegal. This is actually up for debate,
depending on where in the world you live. Some governments can
authorize this sort of test if you have a bank account in that country,
as an example. Typically, though, it will be a company that hires
you, and you will not be able to test their attendees.
Let’s look at another example of how this mindset can take
seemingly innocuous information—i n this case given by the
source— and use it to create a vulnerability. Say you are able to cir-
cumvent a company’s technical defenses upon searching current or
8 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
historical job postings. In this example, a company was looking for
a candidate who had “an overview or understanding of SAP prod-
uct and service portfolio (SAP Cloud Platform Integration, SAP PI/
PO, API Management).” They were also looking for that person to
have “sound knowledge of JavaScript and Groovy Script. [Be] able
to configure Sound NetWeaver. Should be comfortable with Java
Programming. Nice to have worked in UI developments using SAP
Web IDE \#.”
There’s a lot of information in this that could prove vital in vari-
ous attacks against this target, including network, web app, phish-
ing, and vishing attacks.
A network­attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the
target’s network, with the objective of stealing data or performing
other malicious activity. Thanks to this job posting, I know that the
target uses systems applications and products (SAP) systems, which
are tempting to perform an attack on because they store and man-
age the lifeblood of any organization: critical information and busi-
ness processes. SAP systems can be based on different platforms:
ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming), Java, or
HANA. We can assume this is based on Java, given the job descrip-
tion. The main SAP platform is SAP NetWeaver, and ExploitDB
(www.exploit-db.com)— a popular website repository— shows that
vulnerabilities exist for version 7.4, one of which showed that SQL
injections are possible. This type of attack allows attackers to inject
their own evil SQL commands, creating requests and paving the
way for access to critical data in a database of users’ passwords,
account information, and anything else stored in the database.
A simple vish could be made with this knowledge to multiple
departments in the organization to gain more information based
on these findings or to weaponize this information immediately
to attempt to gain forgotten credentials. You may be able to gain
entry to a secure building upon learning of an upcoming event they
are holding and vishing to find out which type of ID is required
to enter. If it’s their work badge, you may be able to find a clear
enough picture online to re- create one. You may be able to circum-
vent a whole building’s security team by finding out what time the
guards change shifts.

The possibilities are truly endless when you have informa-
tion, and you can weaponize it and leverage it correctly. All of this
neatly brings us to the cognitive skills an attacker must exhibit: an
attacker must have curiosity in abundance; persistence to drive that
curiosity into action so as to be moving forward all the time; the
ability to process information into workable categories; mental agil-
