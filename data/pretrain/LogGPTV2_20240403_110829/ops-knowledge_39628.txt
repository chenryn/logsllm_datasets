User: How to configure RAID 1 on Linux system to improve data redundancy and performance?
Assistant: RAID 1 is a redundant array of disks that completely replicates data across multiple hard disks to improve data redundancy and performance. Configuring RAID 1 on a Linux system is very simple, and you can follow the steps below: 1. Confirm that the system supports the RAID 1 function. Configuring RAID 1 on a Linux system requires hardware support or software support. If there is a disk array controller in your system, you can configure it in the BIOS setup interface; if not, you can use the software RAID tool of Linux to create a RAID 1 array. 2. Install the mdadm tool If you want to use the software RAID function of Linux, you need to install the mdadm tool first. You can use the following command to install: sudo apt-get install mdadm 3. Create a RAID 1 array To create a RAID 1 array using the mdadm tool, you can use the following command: sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid- devices=2 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 Among them, /dev/md0 is the device name of the created RAID 1 array, --level=1 means to create a RAID 1 array, --raid-devices=2 means to combine two The disk devices are added to the RAID 1 array. /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 are two disk devices used to create the RAID 1 array. 4. Formatting the RAID 1 Array After creating the RAID 1 array, it needs to be formatted as a file system so that data can be written to the array. The RAID 1 array can be formatted as an ext4 file system using the following command: sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0 5. Mount the RAID 1 array Finally, to mount the RAID 1 array into the Linux file system, the following command can be used: sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid1 Among them, /mnt/raid1 is the directory to mount the RAID 1 array. You can add mount items in the /etc/fstab file so that the system automatically mounts the RAID 1 array at startup. The above are the steps to configure RAID 1 on the Linux system. By configuring the RAID 1 array, data redundancy and performance can be improved.
