User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it urgent to revoke the access to a private repo once a person has been mistakenly granted it and become aware of this? There has been a post on Niebezpiecznik.pl, a popular InfoSec blog, describing an interesting situation.

A company mistakenly granted access to their BitBucket repo to a a random programmer. This programmer subsequently alerted various employees of the company, urging them to revoke access ASAP. He found these employees sluggish (for example, one said he would only revoke the access once he was back from his vacation), so alerted the Niebezpiecznik blog, which subsequently contacted the company. Only then was access revoked.

It is clear that the programmer considered the lack of prompt revocation of access to be a very grave oversight on behalf of the company's security policy. And here is where I'm surprised.

So, let's consider this from the company's point of view. Someone contacts them, claiming that he has been spuriously granted access to their private repo and urging them to revoke this access. Now this person either is or is not interested in the contents of this repo; he also either has or has not strong enough moral values to refrain from downloading it. If he's willing to inspect the contents of the repo, he's already had ample time to do this; and if he hasn't done this yet, then he will likely still not have done this by the time the employee is back from his vacation. In other words, the milk has already spilled and nothing worse than what has already happened is likely to happen in the future.

As a result, I would think, the situation is no longer urgent and can soundly wait until the employee is back from his vacation.

Where am I wrong?

Assistant: There's a number of reasons:


If it has happened to one person, it might have happened to more. These other people might not be as kind.
Who knows, this person might change their mind. When they made the effort to contact you, and just gets a "meh" in return, they might be a bit annoyed and decide to punish you for it.
Or maybe they just want to poke around a bit for fun, and accidentally break something.
You probably want to check the logs to see that this person is telling the truth. Maybe they silently stole your encryption keys before contacting you. You probably want to rotate all your secrets just to be sure.
And most importantly, this is a Big F*cking Deal™. Anyone who is not reacting with shock and horror, but instead orders another pi&ntilde;a colada, clearly doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.


There's some very good points in comments and this answer that all might be fine under certain circumstances (e.g. read only access, no secrets in the code, etc.). That is correct, but I would still argue that this should be taken more seriously. Are you really 100% sure there are no secrets in some old commit in your repo? The very fact that someone who shouldn't have access to your systems got it anyway is in itself a bad omen.
