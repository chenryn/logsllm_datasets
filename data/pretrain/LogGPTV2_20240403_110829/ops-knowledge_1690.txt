I have already created a 64-bit program for Windows using cx_Freeze on a 64-bit machine. I am using Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium. py2exe is not an option because, as far as I understand, it does not yet support Python 3.2.2. Is there a specific option in cx_Freeze that I need to specify to compile the program in 32-bit instead of 64-bit?

Thank you!

In addition to the answers already provided:

To compile or freeze Python code for different architectures (x86/x64), follow these steps:

1. **Install Both Python Versions:**
   - Install both the 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions of Python on your system.
   - Ensure that the corresponding variations of all required modules and libraries are installed in both Python environments. This means that both installations should have the same set of packages.

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Verify that your global OS environment is configured correctly. The following Windows environment variables need to point to the appropriate Python installation:
     - `%PATH%`
     - `%PYTHONHOME%`
     - `%PYTHONPATH%`
   - Make sure these variables point to the correct Python installation directory based on the architecture you want to target (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit).

3. **Reload the Environment:**
   - After setting up the environment variables, re-open any terminal windows or command prompts to ensure the new environment is loaded.
   - If necessary, log out and log back into your Windows session to refresh the environment.

4. **Run cx_Freeze:**
   - With the environment properly configured, you can now run cx_Freeze and any other Python-related build operations to generate the final build for the desired architecture.

5. **Repeat for the Other Architecture:**
   - Once you have completed the builds for one architecture, repeat the process from step 2 to change your Windows environment to the next Python installation and build the program for the other architecture.

To streamline the process of changing the environment, you can either script these steps or use a virtual machine (VM). This will help you switch between the 32-bit and 64-bit environments more efficiently.

I hope this helps!
