For physical proximity attacks, the attacker places a chosen
speaker near the HDD. Thus, the malicious acoustic waves
may be audible or inaudible depending on the chosen speaker.

C. Case Study 2: Video Surveillance
An attacker can prevent a video surveillance system from
writing to its HDD, resulting in recorded video loss. Video
surveillance systems constantly store large quantities of video.
These systems typically use HDDs rather than SSDs because
of the need for a large storage capacity. For such systems, the
integrity of the recorded data is vital to the usefulness of the
system, which makes them susceptible to acoustic interference
or vibration attacks.
Video Surveillance System Setup.
The attacked system
is a Ezviz 720p 4-channel video surveillance system using
its stock Western Digital 3.5” Purple 1 TB, part of Western
Digital’s surveillance series of HDDs. The system stores its
operating system on an on-board ﬂash chip, and so the operating
system is not directly affected by vibration. The system lies
in an acoustic isolation chamber as described in Section III-A.
The speaker hangs from the ceiling, resting 10 cm directly
above the video surveillance system’s HDD. We did not tamper
with the surveillance system, leaving its casing intact. Lastly,
three (of the possible four) cameras were attached to the system,
with one camera placed inside of the acoustic chamber and
two cameras placed outside of the chamber.
Attacking the System.
This test subjects the system
to the malicious signal for increasing durations (Table IV)
and records the results. We choose a 6,900 Hz sinusoidal
signal at 120 dB SPL using the methods discussed in Section
VIII-A. During the course of the experiment, we monitored the
system manually by looking at the live video feed from the
system. After the concluding the experiment, we examined the
recordings from the HDD.

Results.
For all tests, the observer did not notice any
abnormalities in the live video stream, but attack durations
longer than 12 seconds caused video loss in the video recorded
on the HDD (Figure 12 and Table IV). There were two observed
pathologies. (1) Recordings from periods of interference less
than 105 seconds exhibited video loss from about 12 seconds
after being subjected to acoustic induced vibration until the
vibration subsided. In contrast, (2) interference for periods of
105 seconds or longer resulted in video loss from the beginning
of the vibration until the device was restarted.
These two pathologies coincide with behavior exhibited
by prior tests. The ﬁrst pathology, with momentary video
loss until interference subsides, is thought to be the write
throughput blocking effect discussed in Sections IV and V.
The system buffers video data until a certain limit, which in
our conﬁguration is about 12 seconds, after which subsequently
recorded video is discarded until the drive becomes available
once again. When the interference subsides, the system writes
buffered data to disk and begins operation as usual.
The second pathology resembles non-responsiveness errors
(Section VII). Unlike in the previous case, the HDD becomes
non-responsive to the system until system restart. The system
is never able to write the buffered video before being restarted,
explaining the immediate effect on the recorded video.
In the case that a victim user is not physically near the
system being attacked, an adversary can use any frequency
to attack the system. The system’s live camera stream never
displays indication of an attack. Also the system does not
provide any method to learn of audio in the environment.
Thus, if a victim user were not physically near the system, an
adversary can use audible signals while remaining undetected.
IX. DEFENSES AGAINST ACOUSTIC INTERFERENCE
We discuss, simulate, or implement several methods to
detect or prevent system level effects of acoustic interference
from both the HDD level and from the system level.
A. Augmented Feed-Back Controller
Hard disk manufactures did not design modern hard drive
controllers to withstand malicious forces of the magnitude
presented in this paper; however, manufacturers can modify
the ﬁrmware of the feed-back controller to defend vulnerable
frequency bands against the disturbance generated by the
acoustic attack. We suggest and simulate a controller augmented
with a disturbance attenuator to defend against intentional
acoustic interference attacks. Manufactures can implement this
controller as a software update, with no extra cost to physically
replace hardware.
Position Error Signal.
The deviation of the R/W head
from the center of the track can accurately approximate external
vibration on the HDD. Vibration is a major contributor to this
R/W head deviation [28]. The HDD measures the deviation
as the Position Error Signal (PES). The PES varies mainly
because of repeatable runout and/or non-repeatable runout.
Repeatable runout refers to vibration caused by repetitive
operating factors, typically internal to the HDD, such as the
oscillation of an imbalanced disk rotating. Non-repeatable
runout refers to vibration caused by non-repetitive operating

order low-pass ﬁlter.
factors, typically external to the HDD, such as the acoustic
attacks presented in this paper [14].
Design of an Attenuator Controller. We design an
attenuator controller to mitigate the effect of acoustic signals on
the R/W head. Attenuator controllers typically compensate for
precise, narrow-band peaks in mid-high frequency ranges [29],
[30]. However, acoustic signals that affect the R/W head cover
a wider frequency range than what is typical for an attenuator
controller. Thus, we alter the controller to cover a wider
frequency band than what is typical. This modiﬁcation results
in a controller that attenuates a wider frequency band, but with
a lower attenuation strength.
Simulation Model. We design and simulate a feedback
controller with an attenuator for a Seagate 7200.12 HDD that
attenuates signals from 6 kHz to 8 kHz, the greatest range that
affected the drive (Figure 6b).
The simulation includes a 9th-order Matlab model of
the head-disk assembly and a controller designed using
Simulink [31]. The original Matlab model comprises a pre-
existing control structure consisting of a ﬁrst order low-
pass ﬁlter in the return path and a Proportional-Integral (PI)
controller (Figure 13). PI controllers are a common type of
feedback controller used in industrial control systems. The PI
controller calculates the error value of the head position as the
difference between a desired reference setpoint (in this case
the center of the track) and the actual position, and adds a
correction.
Assuming that the pre-existing control sufﬁciently controls
the HDD under normal operation, fulﬁlling basic stability and
trackseeking requirements, the augmented feed-back controller
defense adds an attenuator (i.e. another PI controller [P= 0.0079,
I=0.1442]) plus a second order low pass ﬁlter (transfer function:
[s + 2800]/[s2 + 128s + 2800]) to mitigate the attack effect.
Its goal is to keep the PES within the read/write fault margins.
The simulation models the disturbance d induced by the
attack as a sine wave with amplitude sampled from a uniform
distribution, based on real PES data from a Seagate 7200.12
HDD measured during an attack at 7.5 kHz (Figure 14). On the
non-attenuated controller, this signal induces a displacement
up to 97.26% of a track width from the center of the track,
well outside of the thresholds for reading and writing to disk
(15% and 10% of track width respectively).
Simulation Results.
The attenuator successfully keeps
the PES within the read/write fault threshold within the range

of the attenuator. For example, the maximum displacement for
a 7.5 kHz disturbance using the non-attenuated controller is
97.26% of the track width, while the maximum displacement
when using the attenuated controller is only 8.54% of the track
width (Figure 14). Similarly the maximum displacement for
a 6.5 kHz disturbance with the non-attenuated controller is
58.36% of the track width, but only 5.12% of the track width
with the attenuated controller.
B. Detecting Spooﬁng Attacks with Sensor Fusion
Defenses in the previous section would not prevent spooﬁng
the vibration sensor, but HDDs could make use of redundant
vibration sensors or a microphone to detect an ultrasonic attack.
If the HDD were to detect such an attack, the drive could
operate normally instead of parking the head as a malicious
false positive.
The ultrasonic attacks work by vibrating the piezo shock
sensor or the accelerometer’s sensing mass at its resonant
frequency, fooling the sensor into thinking the drive is violently
moving. However, the drive may detect the malicious ultrasonic
wave using sensor fusion, or combining various sensor data
into a stronger source of information. These various sensors
could consist of additional vibration sensors or microphones.
After detecting the malicious ultrasonic wave, the sensors can
signal to the drive to not park the head and to allow operation
as usual.
Drawbacks are present in both of these defense methods.
Wideband microphones that detect ultrasonic signals are expen-
sive, but will detect the signal reliably. Redundant vibration
sensors from sensor fusion are inexpensive (just a few cents
per sensor), but for n sensors with relatively prime resonant
frequencies the adversary will need to emit n tones to disrupt all
the sensors. While not a perfect defense, this low cost method
signiﬁcantly increases the effort the adversary must use.
C. Acoustic Signal Reduction
Reducing the amplitude of acoustic signals is another
way to defend against intentional acoustic interference. Signal
reduction approaches are either passive, such as using noise
dampening material, or active, such as active noise cancellation.
We implement a passive noise dampening solution, ﬁnding it to
be effective against higher frequencies but having the drawback
of increasing drive temperature. We also discuss active noise
cancellation, ﬁnding it to be infeasible.
Passive Acoustic Attenuation. Many applications use
noise dampening materials to passively reduce incoming
acoustic signals. To test the viability of noise dampening
materials as a defense, we placed sound dampening foam
molded into a 4 cm thick block on top of the HDD as described
in Section III. We developed acoustic vulnerability proﬁles with
and without the foam block, as shown in Figure 15.
Our experiments showed that the foam signiﬁcantly reduced
a HDD’s susceptibility to write blocking. However, it did
not attenuate lower frequency signals to the same degree as
higher frequency signals. This result is likely because of the
physics behind how acoustic waves diffract. One could simply
encapsulate a HDD with noise reduction materials, but this
has one major drawback. Noise dampening material typically
acts as a thermal insulator, leading to increases in operating
temperature (10 C in our tests). Increased temperature has been
linked to increases in drive failure, and thus makes this solution
impractical. In addition, this solution can be costly. Depending
on the quality of the sound dampening material, this can cost
between $10 to $100 per drive.
Active Acoustic Attenuation. Noise cancelation may
seem like a natural defense against acoustic attacks. However,
several difﬁculties arise when faced with implementing such
a defense that would likely make it impractical. It is simple
enough to cancel noise along a single plane of points orthogonal
to an oncoming wave. However, because of the high frequency
of our injected waves, it is more difﬁcult to cancel over an
area large enough such that the read/write head is completely
enveloped as it moves across the disk [32]. This is not
accounting for canceling over the portions of the PCB where
the sensors are mounted. In addition, without a high end
microphone, the machine under attack cannot easily determine

which direction the sound is coming from without use of
multiple receivers. Lastly, a noise canceling defense requires
a sound wave equal in amplitude to the attacking wave to
completely cancel it, which could be difﬁcult to generate
without affecting the hard drive’s operation. In combination,
these difﬁculties make us believe that sound cancelation is not
a practical defense for a hard disk drive.
D. Other Simple Defenses
There are a variety of other simple techniques that manufac-
tures or users could apply to defend against acoustic interference
on HDDs. The most obvious defense is to use solid state drives
(SSDs) instead of HDDs. However, SSDs remain signiﬁcantly
more expensive per gigabyte than HDDs. Another defense
would be to write data to multiple disks spatially spread out in
a RAID conﬁguration such that if an attacker simultaneously
attacks drives, the system could later reconstruct the lost data
from the other drives. If the drives are spatially distant in
separately secure areas, denial of service would be signiﬁcantly
harder. Another defense is to simply disable all nearby unused
emitters.
X. DISCUSSION
Feasibility of Acoustic Attacks.
There are two hurdles
for an adversary to cross: the acoustic signal must be strong
enough to cause errors and the attack must be difﬁcult to detect
or stop. For instance, the attack in Cuba that allegedly used
inaudible ultrasonic waves to damage US diplomats’ hearing
would be an example of being difﬁcult to detect. The attack
would also be difﬁcult to stop; no one has claimed to have
found any ultrasonic emitters.
Ultrasound may remain unnoticed by those in the vicinity of
the attack despite the strength of the signal, as ultrasonic waves
are inaudible to humans. Near ultrasonic attacks may remain
unnoticed because of high-frequency hearing loss occurring in
human beings, caused by factors including age and poor choice
in music.
An adversary may attempt an attack when a victim steps
away from a computer. A malicious program or webpage
might only play audio when people are likely to be present.
If the program or webpage is targeting a speciﬁc person or
group of people, it could utilize speciﬁc knowledge of that
group to target times they are not around. Our tests have
measured a Dell XPS 15 9550 laptop’s output to be as high
