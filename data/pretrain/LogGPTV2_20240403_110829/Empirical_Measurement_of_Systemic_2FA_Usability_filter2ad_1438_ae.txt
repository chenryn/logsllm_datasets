stricter session timeout rules than UIUC.
Neither organizations has a single sign-on service that
spans every service they operate. This means that users
authenticate extra times for each. This was captured in one
of UIUC’s security tickets where one admin explained to
another:
“First we agree that
there are too many
prompts. . . But the real problem. . . is actually with
how we do . . . SSO on campus. Currently we
have 3 major (and more [PII]) web authentication

ADFS. None of them share session information
with one another. . . Introducing 2FA has shined a
bright spotlight on this problem.” (SEC-10803)
A conversion to full single-sign-on (SSO) would reduce
the users’ burden. One early adopter reported that other
organizations have seen this beneﬁt:
“Colleagues at other institutions report that their
2FA implementation was not nearly so difﬁcult,
and that they’re only prompted on each device
once per 2 wks or less often. Having to do it
for each service at least once a day is incredibly
cumbersome.”(EARLY-73)
UIUC has longer application session timeouts than UCB,
which times users out after 15 or 30 minutes of inactivity,
depending on the application’s sensitivity. This means that
UIUC users have a lower authentication burden in general.
But this is offset by UCB’s choice to allow a 30-day device
remembrance window. UIUC users were not allowed to use
device remembrance, but individual sessions lasted longer.
It should be feasible to tune the parameters of these
two timeouts to reduce user burdens of authentication to
the minimum required by the sensitivity of an individual
application. Instead of a blanket 2FA remembrance, less
sensitive application access requests could be allowed with a
remembered device, while especially sensitive apps require
2FA sooner. Session management changes have similar
potential to cut down on the user burden as improvements to
2FA ceremony workﬂows, themselves.
6.3 Limitations
Our study has limitations. We intend our analysis and
comparisons to supplement prior ﬁndings in many aspects
of the user burden added by 2FA, and our ﬁndings do not
represent a complete measurement of user inconvenience
using 2FA. Both of our partner organizations are universities,
whose members have either student or employee relationships
with the organization. This does not allow us to study 2FA
in the context of customers or users of a free service. Both
of our organizations contract with the same vendor for 2FA.
While their vendor, Cisco’s Duo Security, is a leading 2FA
vendor, costs and impacts with another vendor’s 2FA solution
may vary. In general, integration with a speciﬁc organization’s
workﬂow, practices, vendor software, etc., may be expected
to effect 2FA usability.
6.4 Future Work
Open questions in this area include the effectiveness of
2FA at protecting organizations from abuse, measuring the
distractive impact of 2FA ceremonies in users’ workﬂows,
and encouraging the adoption of better second factors.
Measuring the extent to which 2FA has blocked an attacker
from using stolen credentials was something we were unable
to do from our vantage point. We observed from account
compromise records at UIUC that the rate at which user
credentials were stolen did not differ before and after 2FA, as
would be expected. What remains to be measured is which
of these compromises led to an attacker gaining control of
that account. For now, records of successful 2FA logins on
compromised accounts indicate either a benign login, or a
successful 2FA phish. By the same logic, unsuccessful 2FA
logins on compromised accounts likewise indicate either a
frustrated attacker or a benign user mistake. Doeﬂer et al.
were able to measure this speciﬁcally at Google by leveraging
a blacklist of known attackers [12]. Developing a method that
does not rely on prior knowledge of attackers would allow
other organizations to also measure their 2FA’s effectiveness.
Work users experience these interruptions on a daily basis,
and it would be informative to quantify their productivity
impact. 2FA created extra daily distractions for tens of
thousands of people at each university. Past work indicates
that 2FA distractions incur non-monetary costs on employees’
well-being. Zijlstra et al. [35] found that people compensate
for time lost to distraction. However, this compensation
process incurs an emotional and well-being cost. This idea
would support Colnago et al.’s ﬁnding that users’ initial
negative perception of 2FA fades into the background within
months of 2FA adoption [7]. But, these interruptions are
ongoing and incur an emotional and well-being cost that may
explain the annoyance reported by users.
Future work could also try to encourage users to move
away from less desirable 2nd factors. After considering the
ﬁndings of Dutson et al., Colnago et al., Abbott and Patil,
and this work, it is surprising that each institution studied
has a distinctly different split of 2nd factor choices by their
users [2, 7, 13]. The existence of these differences indicates
that either environmental factors or design choices by 2FA
implementers have the potential to greatly impact 2nd factor
selection and drive users to the most desirable 2nd factor
options ﬁrst. UCB’s identity team speciﬁcally tried to educate
users to use the Duo app for push notiﬁcations and code
generation, and ended up with much higher usage of the app
than UIUC.
Telephony 2FA is reliant on the security of the phone
network, the slowest method, the most error-prone, incurs
recurring charges, and causes the greatest support burden.
It generates extra telephone charges equal to about a dollar
per user. Problems with telephony-based 2FA were twice as
common as any other 2nd factor choice (10.20%±3.49%).
This burden is not proportional to its popularity, which
is far exceeded by the use of push notiﬁcations. Finally,
telephony 2FA has long been known to be vulnerable to direct
attacks on phone networks or social engineering attacks on
service providers [20, 22, 23, 32]. The choice to incorporate
user-owned and controlled devices into the authentication

system also requires extra support effort. While for many
users the system is plug-and-play with their devices, some
users now need extra technical support when transitioning to
a new smartphone or phone number.
