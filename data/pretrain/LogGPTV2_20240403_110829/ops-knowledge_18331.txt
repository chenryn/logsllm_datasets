User: Your department is responsible for maintaining a large enterprise-scale network with a lot of network traffic every day. Please provide some commonly used network security measures to deal with the risks of network attacks and information leakage.
Assistant: 1. Firewalls use firewalls to filter unauthorized access and protect corporate networks from network attacks. 2. Encryption technology Encryption technology is used to encrypt data to prevent data from being stolen or tampered with during transmission or storage. 3. Access Control List (ACL) Through ACL, you can limit the resources that specific IP addresses or users can access. When the client trusted by the enterprise cannot connect to the internal resources of the enterprise, the ACL control list can be used. 4. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Using Network Intrusion Detection System, administrators can detect network intrusion behavior and respond in time to ensure network security. 5. Three-layer network design idea The network is designed progressively, and the network is divided into three layers, namely the access layer, aggregation layer and core layer, so as to limit the access of external attackers and ensure internal isolation and security. 6. Security configuration management uses a number of management and monitoring tools to monitor devices and operations. Ensure devices are configured with best practices and ensure quality and secure portability of devices with mobile devices. 7. Threat intelligence Use threat intelligence to obtain information about threats under attack, and where the information came from. This information will help administrators plan and execute necessary actions to prevent malicious traffic and malware access. 8. Backup Strategy Develop a strategy for backing up data to protect important corporate data from data breaches, data corruption, or human error.
