 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8.10
**Code**
    function Foo() {
      console.log(new.target);
    }
    new Foo();
**Expected behavior:**
When targeting ES6, this should compile without an error.
`new.target` is an obscure bit of ES6, but it is there, for example running
the code in an ES6 browser returns what is expected in that `new.target ===
Foo`. When it is just `Foo()` without `new` then `new.target === undefined`.
While it maybe challenging to come up with an emit that works for ES5, it
should be at least supported when targeting ES6.
I suspect and emit for ES6 might be something like this:
    function Foo() {
      var _newTarget = this === window ? undefined : this && this.constructor;
      console.log(_newTarget);
    }
**Actual behavior:**
Compiles as:
    $ tsc --target es6 test.ts
    test.ts(2,18): error TS1109: Expression expected.
