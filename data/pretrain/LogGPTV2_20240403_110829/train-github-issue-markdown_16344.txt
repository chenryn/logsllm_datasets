 _(I am able to reproduce this in safe mode in latest Atom 0.175.0)_
Not always, but quiet often, I have partial selection left behind when I
select a portion of code on one line and then start typing hoping to replace
the selected chars. When I type my first char, this causes selection jump to
the characters on the right and they get deleted when I type the second char.
For example, I have this `test.js` file:
      var where = _.pick({
        classified_id: query.classId,
        section_id: query.secId,
        category_id: query.catId
      }, function(val, key) {
        console.log('  **** val:', val);
        console.log('  **** key:', key);
        return !_.isUndefined(val);
      });
To replicate:
  1. Select a portion of code on any line with a mouse or a touchpad. Release the mouse button.
  2. Switch to keyboard and press the space bar
  3. You should see that the selected chars were deleted, but some of the chars on the right are selected now too.
  4. Press space bar again, and those extra selected chars get deleted
  5. Do steps 1 and 2 a few times if you can't replicate it on first time.
This is a real pain since I always have to do `Command + Z` to undo these side
effects. Sometimes, I don't notice it and my code no longer runs.
