User: Inside emacs I am running interpreters for several different languages (python, R, lisp, ...). When I run the interpreters through the terminal in most cases I can use the up arrow to see the last command or line of code that I entered. I no longer have this functionality when I am running the interpreters in emacs. How can I achieve this functionality?

How can I access the command history from the interpreter inside emacs?
Can I do this generally for language X?

At the moment I need to use python, so if anyone knows how to do this specifically with the python interpreter in emacs please let me know!
Assistant: AFAIS the keys are the same as in M-x shell. See menu In/Out for available keys/commands.
