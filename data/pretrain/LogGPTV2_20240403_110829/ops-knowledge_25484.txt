Question: "Why might an attacker find it significantly more challenging to brute force guess the stack canary's value on a 64-bit architecture compared to a 32-bit architecture?"
 "A": "The stack canary in a 64-bit architecture has 56 bits of randomness, making it harder to guess compared to 24 bits of randomness in a 32-bit architecture."
 "B": "64-bit architectures utilize advanced encryption algorithms that secure the stack canary value, unlike 32-bit architectures."
 "C": "Programs on a 64-bit architecture run faster, reducing the window of opportunity for an attacker to guess the canary value."
 "D": "The stack canary on a 64-bit architecture is protected by additional security layers such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which is not present in 32-bit architectures."
Answer: A
