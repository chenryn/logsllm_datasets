User: How to protect data security during data transmission across cloud platforms?
Assistant: In order to protect data security during data transmission across cloud platforms, the following measures can be taken: 1. SSL/TLS encrypted transmission: use SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt data transmission to ensure that data is not maliciously intercepted during transmission. 2. VPN tunnel transmission: establish a virtual private network (VPN) tunnel, encrypt data transmission, and protect the security of data during transmission between cloud platforms. 3. Data digest verification: By calculating the digest value of the data, it is verified whether the data has been tampered with during transmission, so as to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data. 4. Access control: implement access control on data transmission, and only authenticated and authorized users can access the data. 5. Data encryption: Encrypt data, even if it is intercepted during data transmission, sensitive information cannot be obtained. 6. Record data transmission logs: record operational behaviors and events during data transmission, detect abnormal behaviors and security incidents in time, and take corresponding security measures.
