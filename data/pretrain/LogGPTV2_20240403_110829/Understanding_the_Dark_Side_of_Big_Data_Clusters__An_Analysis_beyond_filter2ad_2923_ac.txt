However, a peculiar trend of the conditional probability of
task success is observed for kill, i.e., it ﬁrst drops sharply, then
increases suddenly and ﬁnally decreases with increasing num-
ber of kill events. A possible explanation for this trend is that
the majority of kill events cause immediate task termination,
although few of them allow resubmissions, so as to increase
the probability of success for subsequent kill events.
Key messages. Task types are determined by the majority of events,
except for kill tasks. Fail and eviction events happen repeatedly
on single tasks, with non negligible probability of a high number
of repetitions. Consequently, the number of unsuccessful events
observed is suitable for predicting the probability of task success.
Particularly, the conditional probability of task success decreases
with increasing number of unsuccessful events observed, espe-
cially for fail and less so for eviction. Prohibiting tasks with a
long history of unsuccessful events, especially fail, can mitigate
resource waste efﬁciently.
B. Unsuccessful Jobs
Analyzing job patterns can be complicated because of the
dual perspectives of tasks and events. As the classiﬁcation
of jobs is given directly by the trace, we resort to a reverse
engineering approach to extract the patterns of unsuccessful
jobs by total number of tasks and distribution of event types.
Moreover, as the most critical performance concern from the
user’s perspective is at the job level (because jobs represent
running applications, directly launched by users), we also
provide the job inter-type time distribution, from which the
user satisfaction level regarding cluster performance can be
inferred.
Recalling Figure 1, more than 50% of jobs are terminated
with ﬁnish, nearly 41% of jobs are killed, and very low
percentages of jobs fail or are evicted. We compute the mean
number of tasks and the event distribution per job type in
Table IV. Taking kill jobs as an example, one can read from
the table that a kill job is composed on average of 86.8 tasks

and experiences a total of 13.3, 20.9, 26.9 and 62.7 eviction,
fail, kill and ﬁnish events, respectively. Reading from the ﬁrst
column across all job types, we see that ﬁnish jobs have
a much lower number of tasks, i.e., 2.7 tasks on average,
in contrast to other unsuccessful job types, except eviction.
Interestingly, ﬁnish jobs also experience a low number of
events, the majority of which being ﬁnish. Combining the
pattern of ﬁnish jobs in Table IV with that of ﬁnish tasks
in Table III, we thus conclude that the key attribute for a job
success is a low number of tasks, which experience a low
number of ﬁnish events.
As for kill job, another predominant type in the trace, it
usually has a large number of tasks, but a rather low number
of events, i.e., the mean number of events across all types is
only slightly higher than the mean number of tasks, compared
with the fail job. In particular, on average a kill job is composed
of a high number of ﬁnish events which roughly account for
50% of the total events. This means that a small number of
not-restartable kill events can kill the entire job, regardless
of how many tasks have completed with successful ﬁnish.
Also, in terms of sequences of events, it appears that jobs
are killed after that the majority of their tasks have completed
successfully (as ﬁnish events are 2.33 times more frequent
than kill events).
As for fail, the second lowest job type, one fail job usually
has 60.5 tasks and contains 139 eviction, 788.5 fail, 49.2
kill and 9.5 ﬁnish events, showing a strong predominance of
fail events over the others. Last, there is an extremely low
percentage of jobs being evicted, compared with the percentage
of eviction tasks and events. Actually, only 21 jobs out of
667624 are classiﬁed as eviction. Interestingly, these 21 jobs
all contain one single eviction task, which causes immediate
job termination without any other event.
1) Job Inter-Type Times: Here, we show the patterns of
unsuccessful job types from the perspective of the cluster,
i.e., how often users suffer performance degradation due to
eviction, fail and kill executions of their jobs. To this end, we
compute empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)
of the time between job completions of the same type, in-
cluding also ﬁnish, in Figure 6. First of all, the average inter-
type times for ﬁnish, kill, fail and eviction are 6.5, 9.2, 247.8,
and 103304 seconds, respectively. Such values correspond very
well with the job type distribution described previously, i.e.,
ﬁnish and kill jobs have a strong predominance. We also ﬁt
the empirical distributions with several theoretical statistical
distributions,
lognormal,
gamma, and Weibull distributions. We use the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov (KS) test to evaluate the goodness of ﬁt between
empirical and theoretical distributions. For lack of space, we
only present the best ﬁtting for each empirical distribution in
Figure 6, along with their mean and KS value.

We note that because of the low number of evicted
jobs (only 21 out of 667624), theoretical distributions cannot
efﬁciently describe inter-eviction time, although a Weibull
distribution with a shape parameter of 0.46 can be a coarse
approximation as shown by Figure 6(a). In contrast, a Weibull
distribution with a shape parameter of 0.58 ﬁts the distribution
of inter-fail time well (Figure 6(b)), as indicated by the low
KS value, being equal to 0.049. When considering kill, Fig-
ure 6(c) shows that no probability distributions can model the
entire distribution of inter-kill time well, although the Gamma
distribution appears to roughly capture the tail of the empirical
distribution. Finally, time between ﬁnish jobs is best ﬁtted by
an exponential distribution, as shown in Figure 6(d).
Key messages. Finish jobs show two important features: a low
number of tasks and a low number of events, whereas kill jobs
have a high number of tasks, which surprisingly experience a high
percentage of ﬁnish events. The Weibull distribution can capture
the distribution of job inter-fail time well, whereas an exponential
distribution is a good ﬁt for job inter-ﬁnish time.
C. Dependencies between Jobs and Events
Our ultimate objective in understanding the patterns of
jobs, tasks and events is to infer the probability of jobs ending
with eviction, fail, kill and ﬁnish by simply observing the
different events that compose a job. In this way, one can
already know the (un)success rate of jobs much prior to their
completion, and take proactive actions to mitigate the negative
impact of unsuccessful executions. To this end, we assess
whether a job type can be predicted by a certain event type.
In particular, we resort to a probability matrix, in which each
element represents the probability of job completion with type
j when a certain event type e is observed. A high probability
value indicates that event type e is a good predictor for job
type j.
We ﬁrst collect all events of the same type e, classify
them by their corresponding job type j, and compute the
probability for each couple (e,j). We summarize our results
in Table V. As an example, one can read the ﬁrst row of the
table as follows: given that an eviction event is observed, the
job will complete with eviction, fail, kill and ﬁnish type with
probability 4.04·10−6, 0.2706, 0.7011 and 0.0283, respectively.
These values indicate that an eviction event is very critical for
the kill job. We note that this is a ﬁrst-order approximation, as
we ignore the dependencies among events of the same task.
As for fail events,
they lead to fail and kill
jobs with
probabilities 0.5827 and 0.4159, respectively. Kill events result
in kill jobs with a very high probability – equal to 0.9363.
This observation resonates well with the previous observation
that many tasks cannot complete after the ﬁrst kill, causing
the subsequent kill of all running tasks of the job and of the
job itself. As a result, when kill events are observed, one can
predict a consequent kill job with high conﬁdence.
Unfortunately, ﬁnish events actually mainly result in kill
jobs. Putting all types into a coarser categorization, i.e., suc-
cessful vs. unsuccessful, we can conclude that occurrences of
unsuccessful events indeed lead to unsuccessful jobs with high
probability, whereas ﬁnish events offer a low predictability for
ﬁnish jobs.
Key messages. Occurrences of a kill event lead to kill jobs with
very high probability, and fail and eviction events also lead
jobs. In contrast, ﬁnish events are not good
to unsuccessful
predictors for ﬁnish jobs.
V. POTENTIAL CAUSES OF UNSUCCESSFUL EXECUTIONS
In this section, we search for the root causes of different
unsuccessful jobs and events, and derive their implications on
system design. Our analysis resorts to a black-box approach
due to the limited information available on the system. We
consider two levels of statistics, i.e., events vs. jobs, where the
former directly impacts spatial and temporal waste, whereas
the latter is directly correlated to the performance perceived by
users. For the event analysis, we focus on task priority, event
execution time, machine concurrency, and requested resources.
Moreover, to see the impact of resource efﬁciency on tasks
executions, we correlate events with resource reservation and
utilization on machines. As for the job analysis, we study the
job size, machine locality, and job execution time.
In the following analysis, we present how different
event/job types happen, with respect to different ranges of
attributes. For each type i, we compute the metric of event (job)
rate, deﬁned as the number of type i events (jobs) divided by
the total number of events (jobs). Event/job rates are computed
for each range of attributes. For example, one can compute the
eviction rate for priorities in the range [0,1] as the number of
eviction events that involved priorities [0,1] divided by the
total number of events for priorities [0,1]. One can also view
