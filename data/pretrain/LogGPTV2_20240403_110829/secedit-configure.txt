secedit /configure
Allows you to configure the current system settings using security settings stored in a database.
Syntax
secedit /configure /db  [/cfg ] [/overwrite] [/areas [securitypolicy | group_mgmt | user_rights | regkeys | filestore | services]] [/log ] [/quiet]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
/db
Required. Specifies the path and file name of the database containing the stored configuration. If the file name specifies a database that hasn't had a security template (as represented by the configuration file) associated with it, the /cfg  option must also be specified.
/cfg
Specifies the path and file name for the security template that will be imported into the database for analysis. This option is only valid when used with the /db  parameter. If this parameter isn't also specified, the analysis is performed against any configuration already stored in the database.
/overwrite
Specifies whether the security template in the /cfg parameter should overwrite any template or composite template that is stored in the database, instead of appending the results to the stored template. This option is only valid when the /cfg  parameter is also used. If this parameter isn't also specified, the template in the /cfg parameter is appended to the stored template.
/areas
Specifies the security areas to be applied to the system. If this parameter is not specified, all security settings defined in the database are applied to the system. To configure multiple areas, separate each area by a space. The following security areas are supported:securitypolicy: Local policy and domain policy for the system, including account policies, audit policies, security options, and so on. group_mgmt: Restricted group settings for any groups specified in the security template.user_rights: User logon rights and granting of privileges.regkeys: Security on local registry keys.filestore: Security on local file storage.services: Security for all defined services.
/log
Specifies the path and file name of the log file to be used in the process. If you don't specify a file location, the default log file, \Documents and Settings\\My Documents\Security\Logs\.log is used.
/quiet
Suppresses screen and log output. You can still view analysis results by using the Security Configuration and Analysis snap-in to the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
/cfg 
/db 
/cfg 
\Documents and Settings\\My Documents\Security\Logs\.log
Examples
To perform the analysis for the security parameters on the security database, SecDbContoso.sdb, and then direct the output to the file SecAnalysisContosoFY11, including prompts to verify the command ran correctly, type:
secedit /analyze /db C:\Security\FY11\SecDbContoso.sdb /log C:\Security\FY11\SecAnalysisContosoFY11.log
To incorporate changes required by the analysis process on the SecContoso.inf file, and then to direct the output to the existing file, SecAnalysisContosoFY11, without prompting, type:
secedit /configure /db C:\Security\FY11\SecDbContoso.sdb /cfg SecContoso.inf /overwrite /log C:\Security\FY11\SecAnalysisContosoFY11.xml /quiet
