### Issue Description

**What Happened**:
I have enabled Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and am using Flask-AppBuilder (FAB) OAuth to authenticate users via Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Users can successfully sign in using Azure Single Sign-On (SSO). I referenced the webserver configuration file from [this example](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/master/examples/oauth/config.py) and set the `OAUTH_PROVIDER` to Azure.

However, all users are being assigned the `ADMIN` role, and I am unable to edit their roles to other available roles. The "List User" page does not provide an option to edit user roles. Only users with the `ADMIN` role should have this privilege.

**Expected Behavior**:
As the `ADMIN` role has the `can_edit on UserOAuthModelView` permission, I should be able to edit the roles for different users.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Enable RBAC in Apache Airflow.
2. Configure FAB OAuth to use Azure AD for authentication.
3. Sign in with a user account.
4. Navigate to the "List User" page.
5. Observe that there is no option to edit user roles.
