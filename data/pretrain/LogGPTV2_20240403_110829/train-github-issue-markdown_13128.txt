**What happened** :
I have enabled RBAC and using FAB OAUTH to authenticate users using AZURE AD.
Users are able to sign-in using Azure SSO. I have referenced my webserver
config file from https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-
AppBuilder/blob/master/examples/oauth/config.py with OAUTH_PROVIDER as Azure.
Now all our users are acquiring role ADMIN and I am not able to edit their
role to other available roles as there is no edit option coming in the List
USER page. My user to have an ADMIN role.

**What you expected to happen** :
As ADMIN is having `can edit on UserOAuthModelView` permission I should be
able to edit the roles for different users.
