Hi,
When I run an identical query on 0.90.1 and 0.90.2 I get different results:
    {
      "filter": {
        "terms": {
          "field": {
            "id": "bar",
            "type": "doctype",
            "path": "lookupField"
          }
        }
      },
      "query": {
        "match_all": {}
      }
    }
In 0.90.1 when filter returned no results the result of the query was also
empty, i.e. 0 hits.  
In 0.90.2 it returns everything. ~~The latter behavior is probably better and
more expected~~ , but I haven't seen it documented anywhere. Did I miss
something?
