User: Based on my project, which is the best version of Python to use? Which is the best IDE to use that runs on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows? Here is the background for these questions:
I'm building a small application GUI that features "drill-down" views and direct manipulation on personalized calendars. Should I use Python 3, the newest version, or an older version is better at this GUI task? I've heard that some of the old GUI libraries do not support the new version yet, but not quite sure if this will matter a lot. Could you please name the libraries that might be relevant? Even better if you could suggest your preferred IDE either under Windows or Ubuntu. Many thanks.
Assistant: I'd recommend starting with 2.7 since most libraries work with it. The differences between both are not too big, so you might even be able to switch if you want to in the future. But before you choose Python 3 and you find a library you really want to use and it's not available for Python 3 you would regret choosing.
wxPython and PyQt are pretty popular. wxPython doesnt support 3 yet...
I prefer PyCharm it's not free but it's so great and it has so many features...
One of the best code-completion i ever had for Python.
P.S.: if its really simple you mgiht even consider using tkinter.
