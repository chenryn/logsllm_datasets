### Abstract
The widespread adoption of 802.11-based wireless access networks in consumer, industrial, and military sectors is based on an implicit assumption of confidentiality and availability. While the security flaws in 802.11’s basic confidentiality mechanisms have been well-documented, the threats to network availability are less understood. It has been suggested that 802.11 is highly susceptible to malicious denial-of-service (DoS) attacks targeting its management and media access protocols. This paper provides an experimental analysis of such 802.11-specific attacks, their practicality, efficacy, and potential low-overhead implementation changes to mitigate the underlying vulnerabilities.

### 1. Introduction
The combination of free spectrum, efficient channel coding, and inexpensive interface hardware has made 802.11-based access networks extremely popular. For a few hundred dollars, a user can extend their existing network connectivity up to 100 meters using an 802.11 access point. As a result, the market for 802.11-based LANs exceeded $1 billion in 2001, with widespread use in homes, enterprises, and government/military sectors, as well as in emerging public area wireless networks. However, this widespread deployment also makes 802.11-based networks an attractive target for potential attackers.

Recent research has highlighted fundamental flaws in 802.11’s encryption mechanisms [FMS01, BGW01] and authentication protocols [ASJZ01], leading to the development of protocol extensions and replacements (e.g., WPA, 802.11i, 802.1X) to address these issues. However, most of this work has focused on access control and confidentiality rather than availability.

In contrast, this paper focuses on the threats posed by DoS attacks against 802.11’s MAC protocol. Such attacks, which prevent legitimate users from accessing the network, are particularly problematic in wireless contexts. Without a physical infrastructure, attackers have considerable flexibility in choosing when and where to attack, and enhanced anonymity due to the difficulty in locating the source of individual wireless transmissions. Additionally, the relative immaturity of 802.11-based network management tools makes it unlikely that a well-planned attack will be quickly diagnosed. Moreover, vulnerabilities in the 802.11 MAC protocol allow an attacker to selectively or completely disrupt service to the network using relatively few packets and low power consumption.

This paper makes four principal contributions:
1. A description of vulnerabilities in the 802.11 management and media access services.
2. Demonstration that such attacks are practical to implement by circumventing the normal operation of the firmware in commodity 802.11 devices.
3. Implementation and investigation of the practical effectiveness of two important classes of DoS attacks.
4. Description, implementation, and evaluation of non-cryptographic countermeasures that can be implemented in the firmware of existing MAC hardware.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows:
- Section 2 describes related security research conducted by others in academia and the "black-hat" security community.
- Section 3 describes and categorizes existing DoS vulnerabilities in 802.11’s MAC protocol.
- Section 4 analyzes the practicality and efficacy of these attacks through live experiments and simulations, followed by an evaluation of low-overhead countermeasures.
- Finally, we summarize our findings in Section 5.

### 2. Related Work
A significant amount of research has focused on 802.11 network security, particularly on weaknesses in the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol, which is intended to provide data privacy between 802.11 clients and access points. WEP relies on shared secret keys for challenge-response authentication and data packet encryption. In 2001, Fluhrer et al. identified recurring weak keys in WEP and demonstrated how to use them to recover the secret key [FMS01]. Once the key is known, an attacker can fully utilize network resources and monitor other nodes' traffic. Stubblefield et al. demonstrated an implementation of this attack that could recover a 128-bit WEP key through passive monitoring [SIR02]. Borisov et al. identified vulnerabilities allowing modification of WEP-protected frames, injection of new frames, spoofing of authentication frames, and recovery of plaintext from encrypted frames, all without knowing the shared secret key [BGW01].

While these works represent the best-known body of 802.11 security research, some attention has also been given to DoS vulnerabilities unique to 802.11. Lough's PhD thesis identifies several security vulnerabilities in the 802.11 MAC protocol, including those leading to deauthentication/disassociation and virtual carrier-sense attacks [Lou01]. However, Lough's thesis does not empirically validate these vulnerabilities. We demonstrate that such validation is critical to assessing the true threat of such attacks.

Faria and Cheriton consider the problems posed by authentication DoS attacks, identifying the assumption violations that lead to vulnerabilities and proposing a new authentication framework [FC02]. Unlike their work, this paper focuses on validating the impact of the attacks and developing lightweight solutions that do not require significant changes to existing standards or extensive use of cryptography.

The deauthentication/disassociation attack is straightforward to implement. During the writing of this paper, we discovered several implementations in the "black hat" community, including AirJack by Baird and Lynn, Omerta by Schiﬀman, and void11 by Floeter [LB02, Sch02, Flo02]. Schiﬀman also discusses a general-purpose toolkit called Radiate for injecting raw 802.11 frames into the channel. However, since this toolkit works through the firmware, it can only generate a subset of legitimate 802.11 frames. Our contribution lies in evaluating the impact of the attack, providing a cost-effective means to mitigate such attacks, and offering an infrastructure for mounting a wider class of attacks, including the virtual carrier-sense attack.

Congestion-based MAC layer DoS attacks have also been studied. Gupta et al. examined DoS attacks in 802.11 ad hoc networks and proposed the use of MAC layer fairness to mitigate the problem [GKF02]. Kyasanur and Vaidya also looked at congestion-based MAC DoS attacks but from a general 802.11 perspective, proposing a method for detecting such attacks and simulating a defense where uncompromised nodes cooperate to control the frame rate at the compromised node [KV03]. Compared to these papers, we focus on attacks on the 802.11 MAC protocol itself rather than pure resource consumption attacks.

To provide a long-term solution to 802.11’s security problems, the 802.11 TGi working group has proposed the standard use of the 802.1X protocol for authentication in future versions of 802.11 products, along with short-term and long-term modifications to privacy functions [IEE01]. However, while the working group is aware of threats from unauthenticated management frames and spoofed control frames [Abo02, Moo02], there is no protection against such attacks in the current drafts under discussion.

### 3. Vulnerabilities
The 802.11 MAC layer includes functionality uniquely designed to address problems specific to wireless networks, such as discovering and joining/leaving networks, and coordinating access to the radio medium. The vulnerabilities discussed in this section result directly from this additional functionality and can be broadly categorized into identity and media-access control.

#### 3.1 Identity Vulnerabilities
Identity vulnerabilities arise from the implicit trust 802.11 networks place in a speaker’s source address. Like wired Ethernet hosts, 802.11 nodes are identified at the MAC layer with globally unique 12-byte addresses. A field in the MAC frame holds both the sender's and receiver's addresses, as reported by the sender. For "class one" frames, including most management and control messages, standard 802.11 networks do not include any mechanism for verifying the correctness of the self-reported identity. Consequently, an attacker may "spoof" other nodes and request various MAC-layer services on their behalf, leading to several distinct vulnerabilities.

##### 3.1.1 Deauthentication
The deauthentication attack exemplifies this problem. After an 802.11 client selects an access point for communication, it must first authenticate itself to the AP before further communication can commence. Part of the authentication framework allows clients and access points to explicitly request deauthentication from one another. Unfortunately, this message is not authenticated using any keying material. An attacker can spoof this message, pretending to be the access point or the client, and direct it to the other party (see Figure 1). In response, the access point or client will exit the authenticated state and refuse all further packets until re-authentication is established. The time required for re-authentication depends on the client's aggressiveness in attempting to reauthenticate and any higher-level timeouts or backoffs that may suppress the demand for communication. By persistently repeating the attack, a client can be kept from transmitting or receiving data indefinitely.

One strength of this attack is its flexibility: an attacker can deny access to individual clients, rate-limit their access, or simply deny service to the entire channel. However, efficiently accomplishing these goals requires the attacker to promiscuously monitor the channel and send deauthentication messages only when a new authentication has successfully taken place (indicated by the client’s attempt to associate with the access point). To prevent a client from "escaping" to a neighboring access point, the attacker must periodically scan all channels to ensure the client has not switched to another overlapping access point.

##### 3.1.2 Disassociation
A similar vulnerability exists in the association protocol that follows authentication. Since a client may be authenticated with multiple access points simultaneously, the 802.11 standard provides a special association message to agree which access point will forward packets to and from the wired network on the client’s behalf. Like authentication, association frames are unauthenticated, and 802.11 provides a disassociation message similar to the deauthentication message. Exploiting this vulnerability is functionally identical to the deauthentication attack. However, the disassociation attack is slightly less efficient because deauthentication forces the victim node to do more work to return to the associated state, ultimately requiring less effort from the attacker.

##### 3.1.3 Power Saving
The power conservation functions of 802.11 also present several identity-based vulnerabilities. To conserve energy, clients can enter a sleep state during which they cannot transmit or receive. Before entering the sleep state, the client announces its intention so the access point can start buffering any inbound traffic for the node. Occasionally, the client awakens and polls the access point for pending traffic. If there is any buffered data, the access point delivers it and discards the contents of its buffer. By spoofing the polling message on behalf of the client, an attacker can cause the access point to discard the client’s packets while it is asleep.

Additionally, it is possible to trick the client into thinking there are no buffered packets at the access point when, in fact, there are. The presence of buffered packets is indicated in a periodically broadcast packet called the Traffic Indication Map (TIM). If the TIM message is spoofed, an attacker can convince a client that there is no pending data, causing the client to revert to the sleep state immediately.

Finally, the power conservation mechanisms rely on the integrity of these messages, making them vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
