Abstract
The convenience of 802.11-based wireless access
networks has led to widespread deployment in the
consumer, industrial and military sectors. However,
this use is predicated on an implicit assumption
of conﬁdentiality and availability. While the secu-
rity ﬂaws in 802.11’s basic conﬁdentially mechanisms
have been widely publicized, the threats to network
availability are far less widely appreciated. In fact,
it has been suggested that 802.11 is highly suscepti-
ble to malicious denial-of-service (DoS) attacks tar-
geting its management and media access protocols.
This paper provides an experimental analysis of such
802.11-speciﬁc attacks – their practicality, their ef-
ﬁcacy and potential low-overhead implementation
changes to mitigate the underlying vulnerabilities.
1 Introduction
The combination of
free spectrum, eﬃcient
channel coding and cheap interface hardware have
made 802.11-based access networks extremely pop-
ular. For a couple hundred dollars a user can buy
an 802.11 access point that seamlessly extends their
existing network connectivity for almost 100 meters.
As a result, the market for 802.11-based LANs ex-
ceeded $1 Billion in 2001 and includes widespread
use in the home, enterprise and government/military
sectors, as well as an emerging market in public area
wireless networks. However, this same widespread
deployment makes 802.11-based networks an attrac-
tive target for potential attackers.
Indeed, recent
research has demonstrated basic ﬂaws in 802.11’s
encryption mechanisms [FMS01, BGW01] and au-
thentication protocols [ASJZ01] – ultimately lead-
ing to the creation of a series of protocol extensions
and replacements (e.g., WPA, 802.11i, 802.1X) to
address these problems. However, most of this work
has focused primarily on the requirements of access
control and conﬁdentiality, rather than availability.
In contrast, this paper focuses on the threats
posed by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against
802.11’s MAC protocol. Such attacks, which pre-
vent legitimate users from accessing the network, are
a vexing problem in all networks, but they are par-
ticularly threatening in the wireless context. With-
out a physical infrastructure, an attacker is aﬀorded
considerable ﬂexibility in deciding where and when
to attack, as well as enhanced anonymity due to the
diﬃculty in locating the source of individual wireless
transmissions. Moreover, the relative immaturity of
802.11-based network management tools makes it
unlikely that a well-planned attack will be quickly
diagnosed. Finally, as we will show, vulnerabilities
in the 802.11 MAC protocol allow an attacker to se-
lectively or completely disrupt service to the network
using relatively few packets and low power consump-
tion.
This paper makes four principal contributions.
First, we provide a description of vulnerabilities in
the 802.11 management and media access services
that are vulnerable to attack. Second, we demon-
strate that all such attacks are practical to im-
plement by circumventing the normal operation of
the ﬁrmware in commodity 802.11 devices. Third,
we implement two important classes of denial-of-
service attacks and investigate the range of their
practical eﬀectiveness. Finally, we describe, imple-
ment and evaluate non-cryptographic countermea-
sures that can be implemented in the ﬁrmware of
existing MAC hardware.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows:
Section 2 describes related security research con-
ducted by others in academia, as well as unpub-
lished, but contemporaneous, work from the “black-
hat” security community. Section 3 describes and
categorizes existing denial-of-service vulnerabilities
in 802.11’s MAC protocol. In Section 4 we use live
experiments and simulation to analyze the practical-
ity and eﬃcacy of these attacks, followed by an eval-
uation of low-overhead countermeasures to mitigate

the underlying vulnerabilities. Finally, we summa-
rize our ﬁndings in Section 5.
2 Related Work
A great deal of research has already been fo-
cused on 802.11 network security. Most of this work
has focused on weaknesses in the wired equivalency
protocol (WEP) intended to provide data privacy
between 802.11 clients and access points. WEP re-
lies on shared secret keys to support a challenge-
response authentication protocol and for encrypting
data packets. In 2001, Fluhrer et al. identiﬁed recur-
ring weak keys in WEP, and showed how to use them
to recover the secret key [FMS01]. Once the key is
known, an attacker can both fully utilize network
resources and monitor the traﬃc of other network
nodes. In a recent paper, Stubbleﬁeld et al., demon-
strate an implementation of this attack that was able
to recover a 128-bit WEP key purely through passive
monitoring [SIR02]. In addition, Borisov et al. have
identiﬁed vulnerabilities that allow WEP-protected
frames to be modiﬁed, new frames to be injected,
authentication frames to be spoofed and plain text
to be recovered from encrypted frames – all without
knowing the shared secret key [BGW01].
While these works comprise the best known
body of 802.11 security research, there has also been
some attention focused on denial-of-service vulner-
abilities unique to 802.11. As part of his PhD the-
sis, Lough identiﬁes a number of security vulnera-
bilities in the 802.11 MAC protocol, including those
that lead to the deauthentication/disassociation and
virtual carrier-sense attacks presented in this pa-
per [Lou01]. However, while Lough’s thesis iden-
tiﬁes these vulnerabilities, it does not validate them
empirically. We demonstrate that such validation is
critical to assessing the true threat of such attacks.
In addition to Lough’s work, Faria and Cheri-
ton consider the problems posed by authentication
DoS attacks. They identify those assumption viola-
tions that lead to the vulnerabilities and propose a
new authentication framework to address the prob-
lems [FC02]. Unlike their work, this paper focuses
on validating the impact of the attacks and develop-
ing light-weight solutions that do not require signif-
icant changes to existing standards or extensive use
of cryptography.
The deauthentication/disassociation attack is
fairly straightforward to implement and while writ-
ing this paper we discovered several in the “black
hat” community who had done so before us. Lack-
ing publication dates it is diﬃcult to determine the
ordering of these eﬀorts, but we are aware of three
implementations to date: one by Baird and Lynn
(AirJack) presented at BlackHat Brieﬁngs in July
of 2002, another due to Schiﬀman and presented
at the same event (Omerta), and a tool by Floeter
(void11) that appears to be roughly contemporae-
nous [LB02, Sch02, Flo02]. As part of his imple-
mentation, Schiﬀman also discusses a general pur-
pose toolkit, called Radiate, for injecting raw 802.11
frames into the channel. However, since this toolkit
works through the ﬁrmware it is only able to gener-
ate a subset of legitimate 802.11 frames. Compared
to this previous work, our contribution lies in eval-
uating the impact of the attack, providing a cheap
means to mitigate such attacks and in providing an
infrastructure for mounting a wider class of attacks
(including the virtual carrier-sense attack).
Congestion-based MAC layer denial of service
attacks have also been studied previously. Gupta et
al. examined DoS attacks in 802.11 ad hoc networks
and show that traditional wireline-based detection
and prevention approaches do not work, and pro-
pose the use of MAC layer fairness to mitigate the
problem [GKF02]. Kyasanur and Vaidya also look
at congestion-based MAC DoS attacks, but from a
general 802.11 prospective, not the purely ad hoc
prospective [KV03]. They propose a straightforward
method for detecting such attacks. In addition they
propose and simulate a defense where uncompro-
mised nodes cooperate to control the frame rate at
the compromised node. Compared to these papers,
we focus on attacks on the 802.11 MAC protocol it-
self rather than pure resource consumption attacks.
to provide a long-term solution to
802.11’s security problems, the 802.11 TGi work-
ing group has proposed the standard use of the
802.1X protocol [IEE01] for authentication in fu-
ture versions of 802.11 products, in addition to both
short-term and long-term modiﬁcations to the pri-
vacy functions. However, while the working group
is clearly aware of threats from unauthenticated
management frames and spoofed control
frames
(e.g., [Abo02, Moo02]), to the best of our knowl-
edge there is no protection against such attacks in
the current drafts under discussion.

3 Vulnerabilities
The 802.11 MAC layer incorporates functional-
ity uniquely designed to address problems speciﬁc
to wireless networks.
In particular, this includes
the ability to discover networks, join and leave net-
works, and coordinate access to the radio medium.

The vulnerabilities discussed in this section result
directly from this additional functionality and can
be broadly placed into two categories: identity and
media-access control.
3.1 Identity Vulnerabilities
Identity vulnerabilities arise from the implicit
trust 802.11 networks place in a speaker’s source
address. As is the case with wired Ethernet hosts,
802.11 nodes are identiﬁed at the MAC layer with
globally unique 12 byte addresses. A ﬁeld in the
MAC frame holds both the senders and the receivers
addresses, as reported by the sender of the frame.
For “class one” frames, including most management
and control messages, standard 802.11 networks do
not include any mechanism for verifying the correct-
ness of the self-reported identity. Consequently, an
attacker may “spoof” other nodes and request var-
ious MAC-layer services on their behalf. This leads
to several distinct vulnerabilities.
3.1.1 Deauthentication
Exemplifying this problem is the deauthentication
attack. After an 802.11 client has selected an access
point to use for communication, it must ﬁrst authen-
ticate itself to the AP before further communication
may commence. Moreover, part of the authentica-
tion framework is a message that allows clients and
access points to explicitly request deauthentication
from one another. Unfortunately, this message it-
self is not authenticated using any keying material.
Consequently the attacker may spoof this message,
either pretending to be the access point or the client,
and direct it to the other party (see Figure 1). In
response, the access point or client will exit the au-
thenticated state and will refuse all further pack-
ets until authentication is reestablished. How long
reestablishment takes is a function of how aggres-
sively the client will attempt to reauthenticate and
any higher-level timeouts or backoﬀs that may sup-
press the demand for communication. By repeating
the attack persistently a client may be kept from
transmitting or receiving data indeﬁnitely.
One of the strengths of this attack is its great
ﬂexibility: an attacker may elect to deny access to
individual clients, or even rate limit their access, in
addition to simply denying service to the entire chan-
nel. However, accomplishing these goals eﬃciently
requires the attacker to promiscuously monitor the
channel and send deauthentication messages only
when a new authentication has successfully taken
place (indicated by the client’s attempt to associate
with the access point). As well, to prevent a client

tion attack. Note that the attacker needs only gen-
erate one packet for every six exchanged between the
client and access point.
from “escaping” to a neighboring access point, the
attacker must periodically scan all channels to en-
sure that the client has not switched to another over-
lapping access point.
3.1.2 Disassociation
A very similar vulnerability may be found in the as-
sociation protocol that follows authentication. Since
a client may be authenticated with multiple access
points at once, the 802.11 standard provides a spe-
cial association message to allow the client and ac-
cess point to agree which access point shall have
responsibility for forwarding packets to and from
the wired network on the client’s behalf. As with
authentication, association frames are unauthenti-
cated, and 802.11 provides a disassociation message
similar to the deauthentication message described
earlier. Exploiting this vulnerability is functionally
identical to the deauthentication attack. However,
it is worth noting that the disassociation attack is
slightly less eﬃcient than the deauthentication at-
tack. This is because deauthentication forces the
victim node to do more work to return to the as-

sociated state than does disassociation, ultimately
requiring less work on the part of the attacker.
3.2 Media Access Vulnerabilities
3.1.3 Power Saving
The power conservation functions of 802.11 also
present several identity-based vulnerabilities. To
conserve energy, clients are allowed to enter a sleep
state during which they are unable to transmit or
receive. Before entering the sleep state the client
announces its intention so the access point can start
buﬀering any inbound traﬃc for the node. Occasion-
ally the client awakens and polls the access point for
any pending traﬃc.
If there is any buﬀered data
at this time, the access point delivers it and subse-
quently discards the contents of its buﬀer. By spoof-
ing the polling message on behalf of the client, an
attacker cay cause the access point to discard the
clients packets while it is asleep.
Along the same vein, it is potentially possible
to trick the client node into thinking there are no
buﬀered packets at the access point when in fact
there are. The presence of buﬀered packets is indi-
cated in a periodically broadcast packet called the
traﬃc indication map, or TIM. If the TIM message
itself is spoofed, an attacker may convince a client
that there is no pending data for it and the client
will immediately revert back to the sleep state.
Finally, the power conservation mechanisms rely
