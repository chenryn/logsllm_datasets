### Observations and Feature Categorization

We observe that DIMMs with an 8-bit width exhibit a higher relative Uncorrectable Error (UE) rate compared to those with a 4-bit width. This difference may be attributed to variations in memory access and ECC correction. Additionally, higher DRAM frequency generally correlates with higher relative UE rates.

To further examine the DRAM process, we categorize them into two groups: 20nm and not 20nm (since the exact processes of 1ynm, 1xnm, and 1znm are proprietary information). The "not 20nm" category shows a higher relative UE rate. However, the capacity of the DIMM did not significantly impact the UE rate in our study.

### Feature Categorization

We categorize the features into six groups:

1. **Static Features**: These describe DIMM characteristics such as server age, manufacturer, data width, frequency, and chip process, as discussed in Section VI-C.
2. **CE Error Rate**: This refers to the number of Correctable Errors (CEs) and their occurrence frequency, e.g., error counts of all CEs within a predefined time.
3. **DQ-Beat Error Bits**: These features refer to the spatial and temporal distribution of error bits in DQs and beats, as discussed in Section VI-A.
4. **Error Bit Patterns**: These features are derived from three risky CE pattern indicators described in Section V.
5. **Fault Counts**: This refers to the cumulative number of faults (cell, row, column, bank, device, and rank) within a given time \( t_i \), derived from the study in Section VI-B.
6. **Memory Events**: These include events such as CE storms, CE overflows, and CE storm suppressed notifications, which indicate the unhealthy status of the memory.

### Machine Learning Performance

**Table III: Performance of ML Algorithms**

| Algorithm     | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| RandomForest  | 0.63      | 0.62   | 0.63     |
| XGBoost       | 0.54      | 0.67   | 0.59     |
| AdaUboost     | 0.54      | 0.78   | 0.64     |
| LightGBM      | 0.53      | 0.82   | 0.64     |

### Feature Selection and Importance

After empirical experiments on the training set, we explored the parameter \( t_i \) ranging from 1 minute to 5 days. The output probability threshold was set to 0.3, as it achieves the best Virtual Interruption Reduction Rate (VIRR) with a predefined \( y_c = 0.1 \). To evaluate the importance of designed features, three feature selection approaches were implemented. Among the top five important features identified by these approaches, four out of five are related to error bits, highlighting their significance in predicting UEs. Notably, the "Minimum error DQ interval" consistently ranked as the most important feature across all approaches.

**Table II: Rankings of the Top Five Important Features**

| Rank | Pearson | RandomForest | LightGBM |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|
| 1    | Min DQ interval | Min DQ interval | Min DQ interval |
| 2    | Max beat interval | Error DQ counts | CE overflow |
| 3    | Risky CE Cnt | CE overflow | Risky CE Cnt |
| 4    | Risky Pattern Cnt | Max adjacent bits | 24h Risky Pattern Cnt |
| 5    | Fault(Row) | Error beat Cnt | Error DQ counts 24h |

### Lead Time Analysis

In Table V, we also examine the prediction results for three lead times. The lead time refers to the duration between the prediction time and the expected occurrence of a failure. Depending on the memory mitigation techniques, these lead times can vary. For instance, a 15-minute lead time allows VM migration to a backup system and the deployment of advanced RAS techniques to prevent UE incidents. With a 1-hour lead time, VM migration may span up to an hour due to the workload involved, and failing machines can be localized and replaced with the corresponding DIMM.

**Table V: Performance in Different Lead Times**

| Lead Time | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | VIRR |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|------|
| 1s        | 0.53      | 0.82   | 0.64     | 0.67 |
| 15m       | 0.46      | 0.75   | 0.57     | 0.59 |
| 1h        | 0.36      | 0.45   | 0.40     | 0.33 |

### Comparison with Existing Approaches

We further evaluate the significance of our proposed error bits features by comparing them with existing state-of-the-art approaches presented in [6]. Specifically, we reproduced their rule-based approaches as discussed in Section V and applied the same experimental setup to our dataset. The results in Table IV demonstrate that our approach significantly achieves a higher F1-score of 0.64 by including all features. Even when excluding the error bits patterns features, our algorithm still achieves relatively better performance, indicating the superiority of error bits features in UE prediction.

**Table IV: Comparison with Existing Approaches**

| Algorithm                              | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------------------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Risky CE Pattern                       | 0.53      | 0.46   | 0.49     |
| Risky CE Pattern ∧ Column              | 0.68      | 0.10   | 0.17     |
| Risky CE Pattern ∧ Bank                | 0.84      | 0.11   | 0.19     |
| Ours (Excluding error bits and patterns)| 0.30      | 0.51   | 0.38     |
| Ours (Excluding patterns)              | 0.45      | 0.74   | 0.56     |
| Ours (All features)                    | 0.53      | 0.82   | 0.64     |

### Conclusion

We present an in-depth correlative analysis on uncorrectable errors with various factors, particularly focusing on spatio-temporal error bits information of CEs. We report six findings from our analyses and failure prediction studies. Through evaluations using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves prediction performance by 15% in F1-score compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Overall, it can reduce VM interruptions by around 59% VIRR in the data center. In the future, we plan to extend our algorithm to include servers from different manufacturers' platforms, particularly focusing on the comparisons of Chipkill and non-Chipkill ECC servers.
