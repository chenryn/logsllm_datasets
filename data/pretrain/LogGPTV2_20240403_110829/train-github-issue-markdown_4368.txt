    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    Make a package foo. Make a test in foo that imports a package bar. Add a compile error
    to bar.
    In your editor, make your build step:
    go test -i -c foo
    When this works, you know that your test is ready to run.
    What is the expected output?
    + go test -i -c foo
    # bar
    src/bar/bar.go:3: undefined: net
    What do you see instead?
    + go test -i -c foo
    # bar
    src/bar/bar.go:3: undefined: net
    warning: building out-of-date packages:
        bar
    installing these packages with 'go test -i foo' will speed future tests.
