##### Detailed description
I am trying to make an app for face detection and eye detection on android
using opencv.  
but every time i try to build the project using ndk-build it is giving me
error: undefined reference to
'cv::CascadeClassifier::detectMultiScale(cv::_InputArray const&, std:: _
_ndk1::vector  >&, double,
int, int, cv::Size_, cv::Size_)'
i have attached the files along with the issue
##### Steps to reproduce
just start a new project and add the code

My NDK is configured properly because i can run simple programs.
