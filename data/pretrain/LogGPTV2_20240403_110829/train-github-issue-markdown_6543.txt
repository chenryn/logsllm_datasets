    Before filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the
    latest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the
    latest version of Go:
    Run "go version" and compare against
    http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html  If a newer version of Go exists,
    install it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.
    Thanks.
    What does 'go version' print?
    What steps reproduce the problem?
    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    1.  go version go1.2 linux/amd64
    2.  init *regexp.Regexp with an empty string, run MatchString()
    3. codes are posted here
    package main
    import (
        "fmt"
        "regexp"
    )
    var (
        //fileRegexp = `chat.log`
        fileRegexp string
        reg        = regexp.MustCompile(fileRegexp)
    )
    func main() {
        fileRegexp = `chat.log`
        var teststring = []string{"chat.log", "a", "b", "c", "not_match"}
        fmt.Println("reg pointer is :", reg)
        for _, testcase := range teststring {
            if reg.MatchString(testcase) {
                fmt.Println(testcase, "matches", fileRegexp)
            }
        }
    }
    What happened?
    we get answers like
    reg pointer is : 
    chat.log matches chat.log
    a matches chat.log
    b matches chat.log
    c matches chat.log
    not_match matches chat.log
    which is obviously wrong
    What should have happened instead?
    programme should panic or report an compile error
