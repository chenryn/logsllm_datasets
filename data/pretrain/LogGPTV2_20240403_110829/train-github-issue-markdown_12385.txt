I'm using scipy's Fisk distribution. The documentation says the pdf is:
`f(x, c) = c x^{-c-1} (1 + x^{-c})^{-2}`,
but it should be:
`f(x, c) = c x^{c-1} (1 + x^{c})^{-2}`.
I think the same applies to the documentation of the Burr distribution. I'm
not sure if this is worthy of an issue, just wanted to mention it because it
could potentially confuse users.
