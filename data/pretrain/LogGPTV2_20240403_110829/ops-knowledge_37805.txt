User: What are the Pro's and Con's of using win32api for I/O and other things instead of simply Python, if both have a specific function for it
I mean, using PyWin32 vs Win32Api
Assistant: The most obvious thing seems to be losing cross-platform compatibilty. Python runs on a number of different platforms, none of which has a win32 API except MS Windows.
