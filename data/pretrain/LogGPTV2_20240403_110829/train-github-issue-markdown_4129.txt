I am writing a probabilistic package and I am using jax as the backend. I am
looking for Owens T function for calculating the CDF of a skewed Normal
likelihood function. I searched through lax and jax.scipy.special and I think
Owens T function is not implemented yet. Please let me know if this is the
case. If so, is there any possiblity in the near future that you implement the
function? I really don't want to switch to either SciPy pf tensorflow and
integrate those in my code.
Thanks,
