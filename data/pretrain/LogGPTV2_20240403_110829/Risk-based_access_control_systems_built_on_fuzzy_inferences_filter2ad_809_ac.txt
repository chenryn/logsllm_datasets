| Metoui et al. [49] and Metoui et al. [52] | Proposed a risk-aware framework combining privacy risk and user trust to identify threats. Access is granted if user trust exceeds privacy risk. Extended in [52] to implement risk estimation based on privacy risk and user trust, and introduced adaptive adjustment strategies. |
| Atlam et al. [41], Atlam et al.

Further extended in [29] to use the fuzzy logic system with expert judgment for risk estimation. |
| Atlam et al. [9] | Introduced eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) for implementing access control policies in IoT systems and adopted XACML to build access policies for the risk-based access control model. |
| Atlam et al. [43] | Provided an overview of risk estimation techniques in risk-based access control for IoT, discussing the benefits and drawbacks of various quantitative methods. |
| Dankar et al. [54] | Proposed a conceptual risk-aware model using real-time and contextual information to make access decisions, and implemented mitigation measures for high-risk access requests. |
| Rahmati et al. [51] | Introduced a risk-based access control model called Tyche, which classifies applications into risk groups and assigns permissions based on the risk value. |

### Research Question 2: What are the risk factors used to build risk-based access control models?

One of the essential components of a risk-based access control model is the selection of effective risk factors that determine access decisions efficiently. Various risk factors can be used to estimate the risk value associated with an access request, enabling dynamic and efficient access decisions. To address this research question, we reviewed recent risk-based access control models and provided a brief overview of the risk factors used. These factors are summarized in Table 5.

#### Overview of Risk Factors

- **Subject Clearance (Role)**: Represents the subject's security level, typically assigned by the system administrator. Common clearances include Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, and no clearance. Higher clearance levels correspond to lower risk values.
- **Resource Sensitivity**: Describes the sensitivity level of the resource being accessed. Higher sensitivity levels result in higher risk values.
- **Action Severity**: Characterizes the cost of a particular action on a resource in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Different actions have different consequences and thus different risk values.
- **Risk History**: Represents the user's previous risk values for a specific resource, useful for predicting future behavior.
- **Trust**: Similar to risk history, it represents the user's trust toward a resource. Trust is categorized into identity and behavioral trust, with only behavioral trust used in risk-based access control models.
- **Benefits of User**: Describes the advantages or privileges the user will gain if access is granted, and the potential damage if access is denied.
- **Outcomes of Actions**: The access control system evaluates the outcomes of actions in specific contexts (principal, environment, and resource) to estimate the associated risk.
- **Context**: Real-time and environmental information collected during the access request, such as location and time, to specify the security risk value.
- **Access Policies**: Designed by the resource owner or security administrator to define the conditions for granting or denying access. In a risk-based model, the estimated risk value is compared against these policies to make access decisions.
