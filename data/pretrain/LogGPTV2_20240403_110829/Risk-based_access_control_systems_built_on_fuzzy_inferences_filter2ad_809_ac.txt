model that uses learned classiﬁers to provide eﬃcient and accurate access decisions.
This paper presented a task-based access control model that estimates the risk value
based on the action to be performed by the requester. The risk estimation process
evaluates the risk using outcomes of actions to make the access decision.
This paper proposed a framework that extends the RBAC model to incorporate trust
with risk to provide the access decision. The authors argued that their framework can
be adjusted to diﬀerent changes in users’ behavior by using a threshold value that is
deﬁned using a risk assessment process.
This paper proposed utilizing classiﬁcation to assess the risk value related to each
access request. The paper presented two approaches; the ﬁrst approach presented an
access control matrix to evaluate the risk of granting access depending on
user-permission assignments. The second approach speciﬁed the best contextual role
that provides the lowest risk and allows maximum accessibility by integrating
security risk with RBAC.
This paper proposed a framework that combines the RBAC with the security risk to
specify access decisions. The paper introduced the concept of RBAC-based
risk-awareness and also provided a formal description of an adaptive risk-aware
RBAC model.

This paper presented a dynamic risk-based model to achieve a highly scalable system
in a cloud federation. In addition, the paper introduced a prototype implementation
for the proposed model to show the eﬀectiveness of their suggested model.
This paper presented a framework depending on subject trustworthiness, object
sensitivity, and the diﬀerence between them using a risk assessment. However,
this framework requires a system administrator with broad experience to provide a
sensible metric for each input before conducting the risk assessment process.
This paper utilized the fuzzy logic system to estimate the risk associated with access
to healthcare information. Three risk factors involving action severity, data sensitivity,
and risk history were utilized. In addition, a fuzzy risk metric is assigned to each risk
factor to decide whether granting or denying access.
This paper proposed a trust and risk-aware access control model that provides policy
coverage and dynamic access decisions. The paper deﬁned a zone policy model that
allows the data owner to have total control over his/her own data. Trust is used to
deﬁne the veriﬁcation of whether the requester respected the obligations that are
assigned to him/her or not. The paper also utilized a probabilistic computational
trust model, called subjective logic, to formulate their trust assessment. The risk
estimation was done using a classic method of deﬁning expected loss in term of
unwanted disclosure.
This paper proposed building a trust and risk-based access control model to provide
access decisions in cloud computing. The paper introduced a privilege management
procedure that combines the security risk with trust to create an eﬃcient and scalable
access control system.
This paper presented a framework for a context-sensitive risk-based model for
medical information systems. This framework categorized information to calculate
the risk value and apply the risk through treatment-based permission proﬁling and
speciﬁcations. This framework provided the access decision based on the severity of
the context and treatment.
This paper implemented a risk-based access control model based on user features
including years of experience, designation, defect level, location index, time index,
and probationary period and estimate the risk value using a mathematical function.
This paper proposed a framework that integrates the risk with trust to provide access
decisions. The access decision is determined by comparing the risk value with the
trust, in which the access is granted if the trust value is higher than the risk value.
The paper also presented mitigation strategies to increase the trust level and reduce
the risk.
This paper presented a risk-based access control model that adopted dynamic
countermeasures to adjust to various changes in the risk value of system resources.
The paper utilized genetic algorithms to build the most suitable set of
countermeasures for a speciﬁc situation.
The paper [1] proposed a risk-based access control model that uses the idea of
quantifying risk and aggregating them to decide access decisions. The risk value is
mainly evaluated based on predetermined risk policies that are created either by the
system security administrator or the resource owner. Further, a prototype of this
model is created using risk metrics provided in the work of Sharma et al. [40].
This work was extended in [22] to develop an ontology-based method to estimate the
risk value depending on the context and adjusting values of risk metrics and using
predetermined access policies to make the access decision.
The paper [49] proposed a risk-aware framework that combines the privacy risk with
the user trust to identify threats related to each access request. The access decision is
determined by comparing the privacy-risk with the user trust in which if the user
trust is higher than the privacy risk, the access will be granted. Otherwise, access will
be denied. This work was extended in [52] to implement the risk estimation process
based on privacy risk and user trust. In addition, several access scenarios were
presented to show the eﬀectiveness of their proposed risk estimation approach.
The paper [52] also introduced adaptive adjustment strategies to increase the trust
level and reduce privacy risk.

The paper proposed [41] a dynamic and adaptive risk-based access control model by
using user context, resource sensitivity, action severity, and risk history to compute
the security risk value related to each access request. The paper also proposed using
a smart contract to track user behavior during access sessions to detect and prevent
malicious actions. This work was extended in [42] to show the validation of the
proposed risk-based model using 20 security experts. In addition, the paper [42]
discussed some of the risk estimation techniques and proposed the fuzzy logic
system as the most appropriate approach for the IoT context where there are no
available datasets. This work was extended in [29] to propose the fuzzy logic system
with expert judgement as the risk estimation method to implement their proposed
risk-based model. The paper showed a detailed description of using the fuzzy logic
system to estimate the security risk value associated with each access request,
showing the access control scenarios of the network router.
The paper introduced eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) as the
suitable language for implementing access control policies for the IoT system.
In addition, the paper adopted XACML to build the access policies for the risk-based
access control model.
This paper provided an overview of risk estimation techniques in risk-based access
control for the IoT. The paper discussed the beneﬁts and drawbacks of various
quantitative risk estimation techniques that are required to implement a risk-based
access control model.
This paper proposed a conceptual risk-aware model, which utilizes real-time and
contextual information in the surrounding environment to make the access decision.
The paper also implemented some mitigation measures to enforce the access decision
in case of having a high-risk value in the access request.
This paper introduced a risk-based access control model to build a system called
Tyche, which is a system that controls the risk in physical devices. Tyche presents the
concept of risk-based access decisions in which it classiﬁes various applications into
several risk groups. Then, each risk group has a set of permissions based on the risk
value.
RQ2: What are the risk factors used to build risk-based access control models?
One of the essential parts of a risk-based access control model is to choose the eﬀective risk factors
that determine access decisions eﬃciently. Many risk factors can be used to estimate the risk value
associated with the access request to make the access decision dynamically and eﬃciently. To answer
this research question, risk factors utilized in recent risk-based access control models were reviewed.
Then, a brief overview of these risk factors is provided. This is followed by showing the risk factors
extracted from retrieved/analyzed publications, as depicted in Table 5.
•
Subject Clearance (Role): It represents the subject security level acquired from the system
administrator. The most popular clearances in the military are Top Secret, Secret, Conﬁdential,
and no clearance. Diﬀerent access permissions are granted according to the subject role in the
organization. Each role is associated with certain permissions [58]. The higher the clearance
granted, the lower the associated risk value.
Resource Sensitivity: It describes the sensitivity level of resources the user wants to access.
Diﬀerent sensitivity levels have diﬀerent risk values. The higher the resource sensitivity, the higher
the risk value if the access is granted to this resource [24].
Action Severity: It characterizes the cost of a particular action on a particular resource in terms of
conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability. So, diﬀerent actions have diﬀerent consequences and so
have diﬀerent risk values.
Risk History: It represents user previous risk values on a certain resource. It can be used to detect
the future behavior of the user toward a certain resource.
Trust: It is similar to the risk history. It represents the subject/user trust toward a certain resource.
Trust is classiﬁed into two categories: identity and behavioral trust. Identity trust is concerned

with validating the authenticity of an object and focuses on objective credentials. While behavioral
trust works with the entity’s trustworthiness, which depends on certain contexts [59]. In risk-based
access control models, only behavioral trust is used.
Beneﬁts of User: It describes any sort of advantages/privileges the user will get when the access
is granted. It also represents what will be the damage that will happen for the user if the access
was denied [4].
• Outcomes of Actions: The access control system has inputs, consisting of the action and list of
consequence outcomes of the action. Each outcome may occur in some speciﬁc contexts, consisting
of principle context, environment context, and resource context. The outcome of actions estimates
the risk of each of these contexts [20].
Context: It signiﬁes the real-time and environmental information that can be collected while
making the access request. Contexts features are utilized to specify the security risk value related
to each access request. Location and time are the most popular contexts [41].
Access Policies: They are primarily utilized by the access control manager (risk estimation module
in the risk-based access control model) to specify access decisions. These policies are designed by
the resource owner or security system administrator to classify terms and situations of granting or
denying access to a particular resource. In the risk-based control model, the estimated risk value
resulted from the risk estimation module is compared against risk policies to decide whether
granting or denying access [41].
