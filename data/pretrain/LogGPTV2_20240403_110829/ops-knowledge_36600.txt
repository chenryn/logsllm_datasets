User: In the Linux operating system, how to use cron to execute tasks at regular intervals?
Assistant: You can set cron scheduled tasks according to the following steps: 1. Use the command crontab -e to open the cron configuration file. If you execute this command for the first time, you will be asked to choose an editor. You can choose an editor you are familiar with. 2. Add task configuration information in the edit file. Each line represents a task, the format is as follows: ``` * * * * * command - - - - - | | | | | | | | | ----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0) | | | ------- month (1 - 12) | | --------- day of month (1 - 31) | -------------- hour (0 - 23) ------------------- minute (0 - 59) ``` where the asterisk (*) means to match all values, and can be replaced by numbers The asterisk, for example, to execute the task at 10 am every day, can be expressed as ``` 0 10 * * * command ``` 3. Save and close the configuration file, cron will automatically read the configuration information and execute the scheduled task. We can use the command crontab -l to list all cron tasks of the current user. If you want to delete an existing task, you can execute the command crontab -r, and then edit and save it again. It should be noted that cron has a limitation that the minimum granularity is minutes. If you need to perform more fine-grained tasks, you can consider using other tools.
