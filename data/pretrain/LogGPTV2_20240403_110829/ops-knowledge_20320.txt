Subject: Assistance with Running Scripts from a Custom Directory in IPython

Hi,

I'm quite new to this, so I would appreciate your patience and guidance.

I have set up a directory where I store all the scripts I'm working on. My goal is to be able to run these scripts directly from within this directory using IPython. So far, I have added an `__init__.py` file to the directory and attempted to append the directory's path to `sys.path`. However, even after successfully appending the path, running any script in the directory with the `run` command results in a "not found" error.

Additionally, I've noticed that every time I reset the kernel, `sys.path` reverts to its original values, losing the new path settings I added.

Could you please provide some advice on how to resolve these issues?

Thank you,
Ron

Hi Ron,

To help you run your scripts from the custom directory in IPython, you can follow these steps:

1. **Append the Directory Path to `sys.path`:**
   You can add the directory path to `sys.path` in your IPython session. This can be done by executing the following code in your IPython notebook or console:

   ```python
   import sys
   import os

   # Replace 'your_directory_path' with the actual path to your directory
   your_directory_path = '/path/to/your/directory'
   if your_directory_path not in sys.path:
       sys.path.append(your_directory_path)
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   Once the directory path is added to `sys.path`, you can use the `%run` magic command to execute your script. For example:

   ```python
   %run script_name.py
   ```

3. **Persisting the Path Across Kernel Resets:**
   If you want to persist the path across kernel resets, you can create a startup file for IPython. Hereâ€™s how:

   - Create a file named `ipython_config.py` in your IPython profile directory (you can find or create this directory by running `ipython profile create`).
   - Add the following lines to `ipython_config.py`:

     ```python
     c = get_config()
     c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = [
         'import sys',
         f'sys.path.append("{your_directory_path}")'
     ]
     ```

   This will ensure that the directory path is added to `sys.path` every time you start a new IPython session.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
