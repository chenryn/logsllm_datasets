User: I want to open a file which is periodically written to by another application. This application cannot be modified. I'd therefore like to only open the file when I know it is not been written to by an other application.
Is there a pythonic way to do this? Otherwise, how do I achieve this in Unix and Windows?
edit: I'll try and clarify. Is there a way to check if the current file has been opened by another application?
I'd like to start with this question. Whether those other application read/write is irrelevant for now.
I realize it is probably OS dependent, so this may not really be python related right now.
Assistant: One thing I've done is have python very temporarily rename the file.  If we're able to rename it, then no other process is using it.  I only tested this on Windows.
