User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Ubuntu Upstart script hangs on start and stop I have an upstart script that will start a custom jetty server. When I do sudo start [myservice] nothing happens. Subsequently, sudo status [myservice] show it as: [myservice] start/killed, process 3586.

Here's the script in /etc/init/[myservice].conf:

description "[description]"
author "[my name and email]"
start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [016]
respawn
expect fork
script
    sudo -u www-data /path/to/grafserv-start.sh &gt;&gt; /tmp/upstart.log 2&gt;&amp;1
end-script


And here is grafserv-start.sh:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/java -Djetty.port=3070 -jar /path/to/grafserv/trunk/start.jar
echo "Done starting GrafServ"


I've tried redirecting the output of the script command to a tmp logfile, but that file is never created. When I start it, I just get a hang, until I ^C. Also, I tried running it with strace but that gave me a lot of stuff about sockets.

Assistant: sudo -u www-data


...will hang if it prompts for password. Have you've checked that the user the "startup script" runs as has sudoers permissions to do that?
