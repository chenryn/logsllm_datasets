User: In Linux, we usually add a shebang in a script to invoke the respective interpreter. I tried the following example.
I wrote a shell script without a shebang and with executable permission. I was able to execute it using ./. But if I write a similar python program, without shebang, I am not able to execute it.
Why is this so? As far as my understanding, shebang is required to find the interpreter. So how does shell scripts work, but not a python script?
Assistant: My assumption is that a script without a shebang is executed in the current environment, which at the command line is your default shell, e.g. /bin/bash.
