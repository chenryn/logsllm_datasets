Certainly, Paul. Here is a more polished version of your text:

**Environment:**
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Jetpack v5.0.1
- Build process follows the instructions on the Jetson Zoo website

**Issue:**
- I have attempted to install JAX using both compilation and `pip3 install jax[cuda]`. The latter method works successfully.
- However, when I run `pip3 install jaxlib`, I encounter the following error:
  ```
  Error: No matching distribution found for jaxlib
  ```
- Additionally, when I try to compile, the `.cache` directory for Bazel consumes all of my available disk space.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
Paul
