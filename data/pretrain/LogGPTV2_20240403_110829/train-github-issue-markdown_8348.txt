In numpy/numarray/_capi.c, for a number of platforms fenv.h or fenv.c is
#included twice.
Lines 227-232 in current source:
# if defined( **GLIBC** ) || defined( **APPLE** ) || defined( **CYGWIN** ) ||
defined( **MINGW32** )
# if defined( **GLIBC** ) || defined( **APPLE** ) || defined( **MINGW32** )
# include 
# elif defined( **CYGWIN** )
# include "numpy/fenv/fenv.c"
# endif
and further down in lines 2940-2945:
# elif defined( **GLIBC** ) || defined( **APPLE** ) || defined( **CYGWIN** )
|| defined( **MINGW32** )
# if defined( **GLIBC** ) || defined(darwin) || defined( **MINGW32** )
# include 
# elif defined( **CYGWIN** )
# include "numpy/fenv/fenv.h"
# endif
In numpy release 1.0.2, the second #include for **CYGWIN** actually reads
# include "numpy/fenv/fenv.c"
so it includes fenv.c instead of fenv.h twice. This causes the somewhat
cryptic error message:
In file included from numpy/numarray/_capi.c:2945:  
numpy/core/include/numpy/fenv/fenv.c:32: error: redefinition of '__fe_dfl_env'  
numpy/core/include/numpy/fenv/fenv.c:32: error: previous definition of
'__fe_dfl  
_env' was here
In the latest revision of numpy/numarray/_capi.c, the second #include reads
fenv.h instead of fenv.c. This appears to be a lucky typo, which actually
allows the compilation to proceed. Nevertheless, the second set of #include's
seem to be unnecessary.
