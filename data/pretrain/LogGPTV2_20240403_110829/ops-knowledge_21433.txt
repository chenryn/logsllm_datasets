User: Is there a way to override all file operations in Python? File operations such as 'open', 'os.rename' and 'os.unlink'.
I want to create a temporary, in-memory file system without rewriting a library. Does anyone know of a script or a library that has this feature? I want to run a library on Google App Engine and it is not possible to write to the file system.
Assistant: "Override"? That word doesn't really make any sense in that context. You can replace them in various ways, depending on what you want really.
Making a in memory file system can be done on most OS's through the operating system, like with tmpfs in most Unices. That's probably a better solution for you.
