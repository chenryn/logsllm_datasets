Abstract
Nowadays, economy, security and quality of life heavily
depend on the resiliency of a number of critical infrastruc-
tures, including the Electric Power System (EPS), through
which vital services are provided. In existing EPS two co-
operating infrastructures are involved: the Electric Infras-
tructure (EI) for the electricity generation and transporta-
tion to ﬁnal users, and its Information-Technology based
Control System (ITCS) devoted to controlling and regulat-
ing the EI physical parameters and triggering reconﬁgura-
tions in emergency situations. This paper proposes a model-
ing framework to capture EI and ITCS aspects, focusing on
their interdependencies that contributed to the occurrence
of several cascading failures in the past 40 years. A quite
detailed analysis of the EI and ITCS structure and behavior
is performed; in particular, the ITCS and EI behaviors are
described by discrete and hybrid-state processes, respec-
tively. To substantiate the approach, the implementation of
a few basic modeling mechanisms inside an existing multi-
formalism/multi-solution tool is also discussed.
1 Introduction and related work
Increasing research effort is being devoted nowadays to
critical infrastructures protection, since more and more na-
tional and international economy, security and quality of
life heavily depend on the resiliency of a number of critical
infrastructures through which vital services are provided.
Critical infrastructures are complex collections of interact-
ing systems and components communicating through multi-
ple heterogeneous networks [12]. The interactions between
these components and systems need to be carefully ana-
lyzed to understand and characterize the interdependencies,
that is how the state of each infrastructure inﬂuences or is
correlated by the state of the others.
In fact, interdepen-
dencies increase the vulnerability of the corresponding in-
frastructures as they give rise to multiple error propagation
channels from one infrastructure to another that increase the
exposure to threats. Consequently, the impact of infrastruc-
ture components failures and their severity can be exacer-
bated and are generally much higher and more difﬁcult to
foresee, compared to failures conﬁned to single infrastruc-
tures. Electric Power Systems (EPSs) are prominent rep-
resentatives of critical infrastructures. Existing EPSs are
composed by two cooperating infrastructures: the Electric
Infrastructure (EI) for the electricity generation and trans-
portation to the ﬁnal users, and its Information-Technology
based Control System (ITCS) in charge of controlling and
regulating the EI physical parameters and of triggering ap-
propriate reconﬁgurations in emergency situations. Under-
standing and mastering the various interdependencies be-
tween EI and ITCS are crucial activities, since most major
power grid blackouts that have occurred in the past have
been initiated by a single event (or multiple related events
such as an equipment failure of the power grid that is not
properly handled by the SCADA system) that gradually led
to cascading outages and eventual blackout of the entire sys-
tem [11]. Among other initiatives, the CRUTIAL project
[1] is addressing the analysis and management of interde-
pendencies and of the resulting overall operational risk.
This paper proposes a modeling framework aiming to
capture both EI and ITCS aspects, especially focusing on
their interdependencies. The modelling of cascading fail-
ures has received increasing interest in the past years, in
particular after the large blackouts of electric power trans-
mission systems in 1996 and 2003. Several research papers
and modelling studies have been published on this topic in
particular by the Consortium for Electric Reliability Tech-
nology Solutions (CERTS) in the USA [5]. The followed
approaches span along two directions: i) statistical analy-
sis on historical data collected from past blackouts, to ﬁnd
predictive models that can be used for planning purposes;

describe cascading failures and studying blackout dynam-
ics. The models presented in the literature (e.g., [6, 7, 2])
usually adopt a simpliﬁed representation of the power sys-
tem; the main focus is on the overloading of system com-
ponents which eventually leads to the collapse of the whole
system. However, these models do not take into account ex-
plicitly the complex interactions and interdependencies be-
tween the power infrastructure and the ITCS infrastructures.
Our approach, instead, attempts a separate description of the
EI and ITCS internal structure and behavior, to better cap-
ture the interdependencies between them. Quantitative as-
sessment of the impact of such interdependencies through
appropriate performability indicators are then expected to
be possible through the proposed modeling framework. A
qualitative modeling of the interdependencies in the EPS
systems has been recently proposed in [9], focusing on cas-
cading, escalating and common-cause outages.
The major contributions of this paper consist in the:
i) identiﬁcation of the main EI and ITCS logical com-
ponents; ii) representation of the EI and ITCS states (as
hybrid and discrete states, respectively); iii) identiﬁcation
of the main characteristics of the modeling framework (in
terms of modeling power, modeling efﬁciency and solu-
tion power), and approaches to cope with them; iv) feasi-
bility of the proposed framework through an existing multi-
formalism/multi-solution tool, by presenting the implemen-
tation of a few basic modeling mechanisms.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the de-
tailed analysis of the EPS system is provided, speciﬁcally
identifying the EI and ITCS structure and behavior. In Sec-
tion 3 the failure models of the EI and ITCS subsystems
and their interdependencies are presented. The state deﬁni-
tion for EI and ITCS is addressed in Section 4. Sections 5
and 6 discuss the EPS main properties to be accounted for
in a model representing the EPS system, the major charac-
teristics of the proposed modeling framework and the re-
lated approaches. The feasibility of the framework inside
the M¨obius tool is discussed in Section 7 and ﬁnal conclu-
sions are drawn in Section 8.
2 Logical scheme of EPS
As derived from [12], [10] and [15], the electric power
system (EPS) is logically structured in two interacting
parts: the Electric Infrastructure (EI) and the Information-
Technology based Control System (ITCS).
2.1 The Electric Infrastructure
EI represents the electric infrastructure necessary to pro-
duce and to transport the electric power towards the ﬁnal
users. It can be logically structured in different components,
as shown in Figure 1(a): the transmission grid (TG, operat-
ing in very high voltage levels), the distribution grid (DG,
operating in medium/low voltage levels), the huge voltage
generation plants (HG), the medium and low voltage gener-
ation plants (LG), the huge voltage loads (HL), the medium
and low voltage loads (LL). A typical scheme of EI is shown
in Figure 1(b), where the components HL and LG are not
present (as in the case of the Italian Electric Infrastructure).
The distribution grid could be further decomposed in two
different medium and low voltage grids, but here we con-
sider it as a whole for the sake of clarity.

One or more generators can be situated inside the power
plants. The energy produced by the generators is then
adapted by transformers, to be conveyed with minimal dis-
persion, to the different types of end users (loads), through
different power grids. The main elements that constitute the
power grid are the power lines, that are components which
physically connect the substations with the power plants and
the ﬁnal users, and the substations, that are structured com-
ponents in which the electric power is transformed and split
over several lines. In the substations there are transform-
ers and several kinds of connection components (bus-bars,
protections and breakers).
From a topological point of view, TG and DG can be
considered like a network, or a graph, as shown in the ex-
ample of Figure 2(a). The nodes of the graph represent the
substations, while the arcs represent the power lines. The
generators and the loads are nodes connected by arcs (power
lines) to the nodes of the grid. Some nodes of the grid can be
connected to nodes of the contiguous grid. The speciﬁc in-
stances that can be derived from the general scheme of Fig-
ure 2(a) mainly differ for: i) topology of the grid (meshed
graph for the TG; partially meshed or radial graph for the
DG), ii) number and power of the generators, iii) number
and values of the loads, iv) number of substations, v) num-
ber of lines, and vi) values of the electric network parame-
ters like voltage (V), frequency (F), current ﬂow (I), angle
(A), active power (P) and reactive power (Q).

the electric equipments constituting EI (generators, substa-
tions, power lines and loads), and their speciﬁc values are
of primary importance in determining the current status of
the overall EI. In fact, they affect the behavior of the electric
equipments they are referred to (e.g., in terms of availability
and reliability of the electric equipment), thus also inﬂuenc-
ing the evolution of the overall power grid. Therefore it is
crucial that the modeling framework is capable to support
both high-level system aspects, like the topology deﬁnition,
as well as low-level system details associated to the main
electric equipments.

scheme (b) for a dummy transmission grid
In Figure 3(a) it is shown a typical physical scheme of a
substation and the connected power lines. This very de-
tailed physical scheme needs to be mapped into a logi-
cal (and maybe more abstract) one, as that shown in Fig-
ure 3(b). The main electric equipments (bus-bars BB, pro-
tections PR, breakers BR, transformer TR, power lines PL)
have been grouped following an approach which has the ad-
vantage to simplify the logical representation. The com-
ponent NS represents the parts common to all substations
(i.e., the bus-bar), while breakers, transformers and protec-
tions, which are physically part of a substation, are now in-
cluded in the scheme of the new logical component AL. In
this way, only two types of different AL have to be con-
sidered (AT
L , not contain-
ing transformers), thus facilitating the subsequent modeling
process (see Section 6). In Figure 2(b) the high-level logical
scheme corresponding to Figure 2(a) is presented, where the
components NG and NL represent a generation plant and a
load, respectively.
