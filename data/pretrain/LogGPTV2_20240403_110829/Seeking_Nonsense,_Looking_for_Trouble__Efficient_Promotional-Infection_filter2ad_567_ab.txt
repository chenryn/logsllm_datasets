infections. Different from the SEO on a dedicated host, these
approaches leverage a legitimate site and also provide their
ad-related keywords to the search engine crawler, to attract
targeted visitors.
The promotional infection can be used for multiple goals
such as malware distribution, phishing, blackhat SEO or
political agenda promotion. Black-hat SEO is often used
to advertise counterfeit or unauthorized products. The same
promotional tricks have also been played to get other malicious
content to the audience at which the adversary aims. Prominent
examples are Phishing websites that try to defraud the visitors
of their private information (user names, passwords, credit-
card numbers, etc.) and fake AV sites that cheat the user into
downloading malware.
Sponsored top-level domains. A sponsored top-level domain
(sTLD) is a specialized top-level domain that has private
agencies or organizations as its sponsors that establish and
enforce rules restricting the eligibility to use the domain based
on community theme concepts. For example, .aero is sponsored

by SITA, which limits registrations to members of the air-
transport industry. Compared to unsponsored top-level domain
(gTLD), an sTLD typically carries designated semantics from
its sponsors. For example, as a sponsored TLD, .edu, which is
sponsored by EDUCAUSE, indicates that the corresponding
site is post-secondary institutions accredited by an agency
recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Note that
sTLDs for different countries are also associated with speciÔ¨Åc
semantic meanings as stated in ICANN, e.g., edu.cn for Chinese
education institutions.
In our research, we collected sTLDs for different countries
according to the 10 categories provided by ICANN [9]: .aero,
.edu, .int, .jobs, .mil, .museum, .post, .gov, .travel, .xxx and the
public sufÔ¨Åx list maintained by the Mozilla Foundation [6].
All together, we got 403 sTLDs from 141 countries.
Natural
language processing. The semantics information
SEISE relies on is automatically extracted from web content
using Natural Language Processing. Technical advances in the
area has already made effective keyword identiÔ¨Åcation and
sentence processing a reality. Below we brieÔ¨Çy introduce the
key NLP techniques used in our research.
‚Ä¢ Word embedding (skip-gram model). A word embedding
W : words ‚Üí V n is a parameterized function mapping words
to high-dimensional vectors (200 to 500 dimensions), e.g.,
W (‚Äòeducation(cid:2)) = (0.2,‚àí0.4, 0.7, ...), to represent the word‚Äôs
relation with other words. Such a mapping can be done in
different ways, e.g., using the continual bag-of-words model
and the skip-gram technique to analyze the context in which
the words show up. Such a vector representation ensures that
synonyms are given similar vectors and antonyms are mapped to
dissimilar vectors. Also interestingly, the vector representations
Ô¨Åt well with our intuition about the semantic relations between
words: e.g., the vectors for the words ‚Äòqueen‚Äô, ‚Äòking‚Äô, ‚Äòman‚Äô and
‚Äòwoman‚Äô have the following relation: vqueen‚àívwoman+vman ‚âà
vking. In our research, we utilized the vectors to compare the
semantics meanings of different words, by measuring the cosine
distance between the vectors. For example, using Wikipedia
pages as a training set (for the context of individual words), our
approach automatically identiÔ¨Åed the words semantically-close
to ‚Äòcasino‚Äô, such as ‚Äògambling‚Äô (with a cosine distance 0.35),
‚Äòvegas‚Äô (0.46) and ‚Äòblackjack‚Äô (0.48).
‚Ä¢ Parts-of-speech (POS) tagging and phrase parsing. POS
tagging is a procedure of labeling a word in the text (corpus)
as corresponding to a particular part of speech as well as its
context (such as nouns and verbs). POS tagging accepts the text
as input and outputs the words labeling with POS such as noun,
verb, adjective, etc. Phrase parsing is the technique to divide
sentences into phrases that logically belong together. Phrase
parsing accepts texts as input and outputs a series of phrases in
the texts. The state-of-the-art POS tagging and phrase parsing
techniques can achieve over 90% accuracy [20], [32], [26]. POS
tagging and phrase parsing can be used in the content term
extraction, i.e., determining important terms within a given
piece of text. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, after parsing phrases from the given
content, POS tagger helps to tag the terminological candidates,

such as syntactically plausible terminological noun phrases.
Then, the terminological candidates are further analyzed using
statistical approaches (e.g., point-wise mutual information) to
determine important terms.
Adversary model. In our research, we consider the adversary
who tries to exploit legitimate websites for promoting unau-
thorized content. Examples of such content include unlicensed
online pharmacies, fake AV, counterfeit, politics agenda or
Phishing sites. For this purpose, the adversary could inject ads
or other content into the target sites to boost the search rank
of the content he promotes or use sTLD sites as redirectors to
monetize trafÔ¨Åc.
III. SEISE: DESIGN
As mentioned earlier, promotional infections often do not
propagate malicious payloads (e.g., malware) directly and
instead only post ads or other content that legitimate websites
may also contain. This makes detection of such attacks
extremely difÔ¨Åcult. In our research, we look at the problem
from a unique perspective, the inconsistency between the
malicious advertising content and the semantics of the website,
particularly, what is associated with different sTLDs. More
speciÔ¨Åcally, underlying SEISE are a suite of techniques that
search sTLDs (.edu, .gov, etc.) using irrelevant bad terms
(IBT) (the search terms unrelated to the sTLDs but heavily
involved in malicious activities like Spam, Phishing) to Ô¨Ånd
potentially infected FQDNs, analyze the context of the IBTs
under those FQDNs to remove false positives and leverage
detected infections to identify new search terms, automatically
expanding the IBT list. Below we elaborate on this design.
A. Overview
Architecture. Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of SEISE,
which includes Semantics Finder, Inconsistency Searcher,
Context Analyzer and IBT Collector. Semantics Finder takes
as its input a set of sTLDs, automatically identifying the
keywords that represent their semantics. These keywords are
compared with a seed set of IBTs to Ô¨Ånd the most irrelevant
terms. Such selected terms are then utilized by Inconsistency
Searcher to search related sTLDs for the FQDNs carrying
these terms. Under each detected FQDN, Context Analyzer

further evaluates the context of discovered IBTs through
a differential analysis to determine whether after removing
stop words, i.e., the most common words like ‚Äòthe‚Äô from
the context, frequently-used terms identiÔ¨Åed there (e.g., the
search result of site:stanford.edu pharmacy) become rare across
the generic content of the FQDN (e.g., the search result of
site:stanford.edu), which indicates that the FQDN has indeed
been compromised. Such FQDNs are reported by SEISE and
their snippets are used by IBT Collector to extract keywords.
Those with the largest semantic distance from the sTLDs are
added to the IBT list for detecting other infected FQDNs.
Example. To explain how SEISE works, let us take a look at
the example at the beginning of the paper (Figure 1). For the
sTLD .edu, SEISE Ô¨Årst runs Semantics Finder to automatically
extract keywords to proÔ¨Åle sTLD, e.g., ‚Äúeducation‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnited
States‚Äù and ‚Äústudent‚Äù. In the meantime, a seed set of IBTs,
including ‚Äúcasino‚Äù, ‚Äúpharmacy‚Äù and others, are converted into
vectors using the word-embedding technique. Their semantic
gap with the .edu sTLD is measured by calculating the cosine
distances between individual terms (like ‚Äúpharmacy‚Äù) and the
sTLD keywords (such as ‚Äúeducation‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù and
‚Äústudent‚Äù). It turns out that the terms like ‚Äúpharmacy‚Äù are
among the most irrelevant (i.e., with a large distance with
.edu). It is then used to search Google under .edu, which shows
the FQDN stanford.edu hosting the content with the search
term. Under this FQDN, SEISE again searches for ‚Äúpharmacy.‚Äù
The results page is presented in Figure 1. As we can see,
many search result items (for different URLs) contain same
topic words, similar snippet and even URL patterns, which are
typically caused by mass injection of unauthorized advertising
materials. These items form the context for the IBT ‚Äúpharmacy‚Äù
in stanford.edu.
Our approach then converts the context (the result items)
found into a high-dimensional vector, with the frequency of
each word (except those common stop words like ‚Äòshe‚Äô, ‚Äòdoes‚Äô,
etc.) as an element of the vector. The vector, considered to be
a representative of the context, then goes through a differential
analysis: it is compared with the vector of a reference, the
search results page of site:stanford.edu that describes the
generic content under the FQDN. The purpose is to Ô¨Ånd out
whether the context is compatible with the theme of the FQDN.
If the distance between them is large, then we know that
this FQDN hosts a large amount of similar text semantically
incompatible with its theme (i.e., most of the high frequent
words in the suspicious text, such as ‚Äúviagra‚Äù, rarely appear
in the common content of the FQDN). Also given the fact
that such text is the context for the search terms irrelevant to
the sTLD of the current FQDN but popular in promotional
infections, we conclude that the FQDN stanford.edu is indeed
compromised.
Once an infection is detected, the terms extracted from
the context of ‚Äúpharmacy‚Äù are then analyzed and those most
irrelevant to the semantics of .edu are added to the IBT list
for Ô¨Ånding other compromised FQDNs. Examples of the terms
include ‚Äúviagra‚Äù, ‚Äúcialis‚Äù, and ‚ÄútadalaÔ¨Ål‚Äù. In addition to the
words, the URL pattern of the infection is then generalized to
detect other advertising targets (e.g., red wine) not included in
the initial IBT list (e.g., those for promoting illegal drugs). The
same technique can also be applied to Ô¨Ånd out compromised
gTLDs like the .com FQDNs involved in the same campaign.
B. Semantics-based Detection
In this section, we present the technical details for Semantics
Finder, Inconsistency Searcher and Context Analyzer.
Finding semantics for sTLDs. The Ô¨Årst step of our approach
is to automatically build a semantic proÔ¨Åle for an sTLD. Such
a proÔ¨Åle is represented as a set of terms, which serve as an
input to the Inconsistency Searcher for choosing right IBTs.
For example, the semantic representation of the sTLD .edu.cn
could be ‚ÄúChinese university‚Äù, ‚Äúeducation‚Äù, ‚Äúbusiness school‚Äù,
etc. SEISE automatically identiÔ¨Åes these terms from different
sources using a term extraction technique. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the
following two sources are currently utilized by our prototype:
‚Ä¢ Wikipedia:
the Wikipedia pages for sTLDs provide a
comprehensive summary of different sTLDs. For example, https:
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mil proÔ¨Åles the sTLD .mil, including
its sponsor (‚ÄúDoD Information System Agency‚Äù), intended use
(‚Äúmilitary entities‚Äù), registration restrictions (‚Äútightly restricted
to eligible agencies‚Äù), etc. In our research, we ran a crawler
that collected the wiki pages for 80 sTLDs.
‚Ä¢ Search results: the search results page for an sTLD query
(e.g., site:gov) lists high-proÔ¨Åle websites under the sTLD. As
mentioned earlier, each search result includes a snippet of a
website, which offers a concise but high-quality description
of the website. Since the websites under the sTLD carry the
semantic information of the sTLD, such descriptions can be
used as another semantic source of the sTLD. Therefore,
our approach collected the search result pages of all 403
sTLDs using automatically-generated queries in the form of
‚Äúsite:sTLD‚Äù, such as site:edu. From each result page, top 100
search results are picked up for constructing the related sTLD‚Äôs
semantic proÔ¨Åle.
From such sTLD semantics sources, the Semantics Finder
runs a content term extraction tool to automatically gather
keywords from the sources. These keywords are supposed to
best summarize the topic of each source and therefore represent
the semantics of an sTLD. In our implementation, we utilized
an open-source tool topia.termextract [30] for this purpose.
From each keyword extracted, our approach further calculates
its frequency, which is assigned to the keyword as its weight.
All together, top 20 keywords are chosen for each sTLD as its
semantics proÔ¨Åle.
A problem is that among all 403 sTLDs, 71 of them are
non-English ones, which include Chinese, Russian, French,
Arabic, etc., 89 languages altogether. Analyzing these sTLDs
in their native languages is complicated, due to the challenges
in processing these languages: for example, segmenting Chinese
characters into words is known to be hard [35]. To solve this
problem, we utilized Google Translate to convert the search
page of an non-English sTLD query into English and then
extract their English keywords. The approach was found to
