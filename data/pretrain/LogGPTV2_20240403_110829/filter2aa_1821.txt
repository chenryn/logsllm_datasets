**The Second Edition: Remembering Who We Are**
by Richard Thieme

Most of us spend a significant portion of our lives navigating the surface of trivial necessities, the daily tasks that fill our waking hours. Occasionally, we pause to examine the etched patterns in this icy veneer, believing they reveal the contours of our character and choices. However, there is more at play beneath the surface.

Sometimes, the ice thins, revealing a hidden springtime within us, a season governed by an inner sun that knows precisely what we need and when. The ice cracks, and we plunge into a darkness that paradoxically bursts with light, immersing us in the profound sources of meaning. In these moments, we grasp what truly matters, what is real.

The mundane quickly reasserts itself, and the significance of those moments fades, almost but not quite forgotten. Yet, we never truly forget. When it happens again, we recognize the experience for what it is. We connect these moments into a deeper, more fundamental pattern, and we say to ourselves, "Yes, I know this place. I have been here before." We remember who we truly are.

A few years ago, a long-standing friendship with another couple gradually dissipated. Over a year or two, it faded quietly, as relationships often do. Our paths had diverged, with different interests, values, and choices pulling us apart. Eventually, there was little point in getting together anymore. This was acceptable; we understood that people grow and change.

Our lives, filled with trivial essentials, moved on. Then, a few weeks ago, intense waves of energy surged through me, associated with the name of the woman. These palpable waves, difficult to explain, seized my attention. This used to happen regularly during my time in the ministry, where I was connected to many people with an intention to be open. While some might dismiss such occurrences as mere coincidence, other times, calling them coincidences is a stretch.

I recall a specific instance when I was visiting the mother of a parish member in a nursing home. One day, after my morning visit, a wave of energy compelled me to return. I turned right instead of left, and as I arrived, the parishioner was waiting outside. "How did they find you so fast?" she asked. I learned her mother had just passed away, and she had run to the office to call me. Some suggested I had picked up subliminal clues, but the rational explanation raises more questions than it answers. Spirituality, I realized, means learning to listen and not shut out impulses, even if we don't understand them.

In the past, I would have responded to such feelings with a phone call. But this time, I resisted, despite the successive waves of feeling. Last week, my wife showed me an obituary for the mother of my long-ago friend. She had been in the final stages of dying when the waves began. We attended the funeral and offered condolences. The following Sunday, remembering their weekly dinner tradition, I called and suggested we have dinner. They were alone, and we spent hours talking.

We realized we were still friends, but that wasn't the point. The point was that I told her about the waves of feeling, and she confirmed they began when her mother's condition worsened. These deep feelings were a distress call, a non-localized connection, akin to entanglement. I admitted to betraying my calling, not as a former clergyman but as a human being, by resisting the call and refusing to honor our connection.

Professional ministry, I believe, is a training program for becoming more fully human. It teaches us the resilience and heroism inherent in humanity. Once you truly know, not just think, that we are all connected, that we are part of something greater, it becomes imperative to care for others as we care for ourselves. This is not a new idea, but truly understanding it makes a difference.

I chose to push away what I felt, and that was a betrayal of the real, a betrayal of the profound sources of meaning and love. At dinner, I acknowledged this, and she cried, saying in that moment, it was honored. Our readiness is all. We can neglect to remember what we have learned, but we are cells in a single body, knitted into a being that extends to the edges of spacetime. Our sins are often sins of forgetting, omission, or neglect. When we remember who we are, we act in accordance with the truth, and the universe sings in a single, harmonious chorus.
