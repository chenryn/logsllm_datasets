### 1. Aerial Platform
- **Multi-rotor vs. Fixed Wing:**
  - **Multi-rotor Drones:** More maneuverable, easier to control, and suitable for close-range operations.
  - **Fixed-wing Drones:** Better for long-distance missions and can stay airborne longer.

- **Flight Controller:**
  - Essential for stabilizing and controlling the drone's flight.
  - Popular options include Pixhawk, DJI Naza, and others.

- **Cameras:**
  - High-resolution cameras for visual surveillance.
  - Thermal imaging cameras for night or low-light conditions.

- **GPS:**
  - GPS is crucial for navigation and positioning.
  - Provides real-time location data and enables autonomous flight modes.

- **Other Considerations:**
  - **Battery:** High-capacity batteries for extended flight times.
  - **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC):** Regulate motor speed.
  - **Motors and Propellers:** Efficient motors and propellers for optimal performance.

- **Form Factor Practicality:**
  - **Barrier to Entry:** Cost and complexity of building and operating a drone.
  - **Practicality:** Ease of use, portability, and maintenance.

### 3. Hacking and Surveillance Payload
- **D.T.F (Detect, Track, Follow):**
  - Tools and techniques for detecting, tracking, and following targets.
  - **Open Source Projects:**
    - **Snoopy-ng:** An open-source tool for wireless network reconnaissance.
      - **In Progress:**
        - GSM, iBeacon, Software Defined Radio (SDR), ZigBee, ANT, NFC, RFID
      - **Other Ideas:**
        - OpenCV for image processing and physical detection.

### 4. Methodology
- **Vehicle:**
  - Selection and configuration of the aerial platform.
- **Payload:**
  - Integration of hacking and surveillance tools.
- **Autonomy:**
  - Implementation of autonomous flight and mission execution.
- **Ground Control:**
  - Setup and operation of ground control systems.
