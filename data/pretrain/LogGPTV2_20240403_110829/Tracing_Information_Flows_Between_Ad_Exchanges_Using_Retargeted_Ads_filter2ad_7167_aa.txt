Abstract
Numerous surveys have shown that Web users are con-
cerned about the loss of privacy associated with online
tracking. Alarmingly, these surveys also reveal that peo-
ple are also unaware of the amount of data sharing that
occurs between ad exchanges, and thus underestimate the
privacy risks associated with online tracking.
In reality, the modern ad ecosystem is fueled by a flow
of user data between trackers and ad exchanges. Al-
though recent work has shown that ad exchanges rou-
tinely perform cookie matching with other exchanges,
these studies are based on brittle heuristics that cannot
detect all forms of information sharing, especially under
adversarial conditions.
In this study, we develop a methodology that is able
to detect client- and server-side flows of information be-
tween arbitrary ad exchanges. Our key insight is to lever-
age retargeted ads as a tool for identifying information
flows. Intuitively, our methodology works because it re-
lies on the semantics of how exchanges serve ads, rather
than focusing on specific cookie matching mechanisms.
Using crawled data on 35,448 ad impressions, we show
that our methodology can successfully categorize four
different kinds of information sharing behavior between
ad exchanges, including cases where existing heuristic
methods fail.
We conclude with a discussion of how our findings
and methodologies can be leveraged to give users more
control over what kind of ads they see and how their in-
formation is shared between ad exchanges.

Introduction
People have complicated feelings with respect to online
behavioral advertising. While surveys have shown that
some users prefer relevant, targeted ads to random, un-
targeted ads [60, 14], this preference has caveats. For
example, users are uncomfortable with ads that are tar-
geted based on sensitive Personally Identifiable Informa-
tion (PII) [44, 4] or specific kinds of browsing history
(e.g., visiting medical websites) [41]. Furthermore, some
users are universally opposed to online tracking, regard-
less of circumstance [46, 60, 14].
One particular concern held by users is their “digi-
tal footprint” [33, 65, 58], i.e., which first- and third-
parties are able to track their browsing history? Large-
scale web crawls have repeatedly shown that trackers are
ubiquitous [24, 19], with DoubleClick alone being able
to observe visitors on 40% of websites in the Alexa Top-
100K [11]. These results paint a picture of a balkanized
web, where trackers divide up the space and compete for
the ability to collect data and serve targeted ads.
However, this picture of the privacy landscape is at
odds with the current reality of the ad ecosystem. Specif-
ically, ad exchanges routinely perform cookie matching
with each other, to synchronize unique identifiers and
share user data [2, 54, 21]. Cookie matching is a pre-
condition for ad exchanges to participate in Real Time
Bidding (RTB) auctions, which have become the domi-
nant mechanism for buying and selling advertising inven-
tory from publishers. Problematically, Hoofnagle et al.
report that users naïvely believe that privacy policies pre-
vent companies from sharing user data with third-parties,
which is not always the case [32].
Despite user concerns about their digital footprint, we
currently lack the tools to fully understand how informa-
tion is being shared between ad exchanges. Prior empiri-
cal work on cookie matching has relied on heuristics that
look for specific strings in HTTP messages to identify
flows between ad networks [2, 54, 21]. However, these
heuristics are brittle in the face of obfuscation: for exam-
ple, DoubleClick cryptographically hashes their cookies
before sending them to other ad networks [1]. More fun-
damentally, analysis of client-side HTTP messages are
insufficient to detect server-side information flows be-
tween ad networks.

In this study, we develop a methodology that is able
to detect client- and server-side flows of information be-
tween arbitrary ad exchanges that serve retargeted ads.
Retargeted ads are the most specific form of behavioral
ads, where a user is targeted with ads related to the exact
products she has previously browsed (see § 2.2 for defi-
nition). For example, Bob visits nike.com and browses
for running shoes but decides not to purchase them. Bob
later visits cnn.com and sees an ad for the exact same
running shoes from Nike.
Our key insight is to leverage retargeted ads as a mech-
anism for identifying information flows. This is possi-
ble because the strict conditions that must be met for a
retarget to be served allow us to infer the precise flow
of tracking information that facilitated the serving of the
ad. Intuitively, our methodology works because it relies
on the semantics of how exchanges serve ads, rather than
focusing on specific cookie matching mechanisms.
To demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology, we
conduct extensive experiments on real data. We train 90
personas by visiting popular e-commerce sites, and then
crawl major publishers to gather retargeted ads [9, 12].
Our crawler is an instrumented version of Chromium that
records the inclusion chain for every resource it encoun-
ters [5], including 35,448 chains associated with 5,102
unique retargeted ads. We use carefully designed pattern
matching rules to categorize each of these chains, which
reveal 1) the pair of ad exchanges that shared informa-
tion in order to serve the retarget, and 2) the mechanism
used to share the data (e.g., cookie matching).
In summary, we make the following contributions:
• We present a novel methodology for identifying
information flows between ad networks that
is
content- and ad exchange-agnostic. Our methodol-
ogy allows to identify four different categories of in-
formation sharing between ad exchanges, of which
cookie matching is one.
• Using crawled data, we show that the heuristic
methods used by prior work to analyze cookie
matching are unable to identify 31% of ad exchange
pairs that share data.
• Although it is known that Google’s privacy policy
allows it to share data between its services [26],
we provide the first empirical evidence that Google
uses this capability to serve retargeted ads.
• Using graph analysis, we show how our data can
be used to automatically infer the roles played
by different ad exchanges (e.g., Supply-Side and
Demand-Side Platforms). These results expand
upon prior work [25] and facilitate a more nuanced
understanding of the online ad ecosystem.
Ultimately, we view our methodology as a stepping
stone towards more balanced privacy protection tools for
users, that also enable publishers to earn revenue. Sur-
veys have shown that users are not necessarily opposed
to online ads: some users are just opposed to track-
ing [46, 60, 14], while others simply desire more nu-
anced control over their digital footprint [4, 41]. How-
ever, existing tools (e.g., browser extensions) cannot dis-
tinguish between targeted and untargeted ads, thus leav-
ing users with no alternative but to block all ads. Con-
versely, our results open up the possibility of building
in-browser tools that just block cookie matching, which
will effectively prevent most targeted ads from RTB auc-
tions, while still allowing untargeted ads to be served.
Open Source.
As a service to the community, we
have open sourced all the data from this project. This
includes over 7K labeled behaviorally targeted and retar-
geted ads, as well as the inclusion chains and full HTTP
traces associated with these ads. The data is available at:

2 Background and Definitions
In this section, we set the stage for our study by providing
background about the online display ad industry, as well
as defining key terminology. We focus on techniques and
terms related to Real Time Bidding and retargeted ads,
since they are the focus of our study.
2.1 Online Display Advertising
Online display advertising is fundamentally a matching
problem. On one side are publishers (e.g., news web-
sites, blogs, etc.) who produce content, and earn revenue
by displaying ads to users. On the other side are adver-
tisers who want to display ads to particular users (e.g.,
based on demographics or market segments). Unfortu-
nately, the online user population is fragmented across
hundreds of thousands of publishers, making it difficult
for advertisers to reach desired customers.
Ad networks bridge this gap by aggregating inventory
from publishers (i.e., space for displaying ads) and fill-
ing it with ads from advertisers. Ad networks make it
possible for advertisers to reach a broad swath of users,
while also guaranteeing a steady stream of revenue for
publishers. Inventory is typically sold using a Cost per
Mille (CPM) model, where advertisers purchase blocks
of 1000 impressions (views of ads), or a Cost per Click
(CPC) model, where the advertiser pays a small fee each
time their ad is clicked by a user.
Ad Exchanges and Auctions.
Over time, ad net-
works are being supplanted by ad exchanges that rely
on an auction-based model. In Real-time Bidding (RTB)
exchanges, advertisers bid on individual impressions, in
real-time; the winner of the auction is permitted to serve

an ad to the user. Google’s DoubleClick is the largest ad
exchange, and it supports RTB.
As shown in Figure 1, there is a distinction between
Supply-side Platforms (SSPs) and Demand-side Plat-
forms (DSPs) with respect to ad auctions. SSPs work
with publishers to manage their relationships with mul-
tiple ad exchanges, typically to maximize revenue. For
example, OpenX is an SSP. In contrast, DSPs work with
advertisers to assess the value of each impression and
optimize bid prices. MediaMath is an example of a DSP.
To make matters more complicated, many companies of-
fer products that cross categories; for example, Rubicon
Project offers SSP, ad exchange, and DSP products. We
direct interested readers to [45] for more discussion of
the modern online advertising ecosystem.
2.2 Targeted Advertising
Initially,
the online display ad industry focused on
generic brand ads (e.g., “Enjoy Coca-Cola!”) or contex-
tual ads (e.g., an ad for Microsoft on StackOverflow).
However, the industry quickly evolved towards behav-
ioral targeted ads that are served to specific users based
on their browsing history, interests, and demographics.
Tracking.
To serve targeted ads, ad exchanges and
advertisers must collect data about online users by track-
ing their actions. Publishers embed JavaScript or invis-
ible “tracking pixels” that are hosted by tracking com-
panies into their web pages, thus any user who visits
the publisher also receives third-party cookies from the
tracker (we discuss other tracking mechanisms in § 3).
Numerous studies have shown that trackers are perva-
sive across the Web [38, 36, 55, 11], which allows ad-

vertisers to collect users’ browsing history. All major ad
exchanges, like DoubleClick and Rubicon, perform user
tracking, but there are also companies like BlueKai that
just specialize in tracking.
Cookie Matching.
During an RTB ad auction, DSPs
submit bids on an impression. The amount that a DSP
bids on a given impression is intrinsically linked to the
amount of information they have about that user. For
example, a DSP is unlikely to bid highly for user u
whom they have never observed before, whereas a DSP
may bid heavily for user v who they have recently ob-
served browsing high-value websites (e.g., the baby site
TheBump.com).
However, the Same Origin Policy (SOP) hinders the
ability of DSPs to identify users in ad auctions. As shown
in Figure 1, requests are first sent to an SSP which for-
wards the impression to an exchange (or holds the auc-
tions itself). At this point, the SSP’s cookies are known,
but not the DSPs. This leads to a catch-22 situation: a
DSP cannot read its cookies until it contacts the user, but
it cannot contact the user without first bidding and win-
ning the auction.
To circumvent SOP restrictions, ad exchanges and ad-
vertisers engage in cookie matching (sometimes called
cookie syncing). Cookie matching is illustrated in Fig-
ure 2:
the user’s browser first contacts ad exchange
s.com, which returns an HTTP redirect to its partner
d.com. s reads its own cookie, and includes it as a pa-
rameter in the redirect to d. d now has a mapping from
its cookie to s’s. In the future, if d participates in an auc-
tion held by s, it will be able to identify matched users
using s’s cookie. Note that some ad exchanges (includ-
ing DoubleClick) send cryptographically hashed cookies
to their partners, which prevents the ad network’s true
cookies from leaking to third-parties.
Retargeted Ads.
In this study, we focus on retar-
geted ads, which are the most specific type of targeted
display ads. Two conditions must be met for a DSP
to serve a retargeted ad to a user u: 1) the DSP must
know that u browsed a specific product on a specific e-
commerce site, and 2) the DSP must be able to uniquely
identify u during an auction. If these conditions are met,
the DSP can serve u a highly personalized ad reminding
them to purchase the product from the retailer. Cookie

DSPs to meet requirement (2).
3 Related Work
Next, we briefly survey related work on online advertis-
ing. We begin by looking at more general studies of the
advertising and tracking ecosystem, and conclude with a
more focused examination of studies on cookie match-
ing and retargeting. Although existing studies on cookie
matching demonstrate that this practice is widespread
and that the privacy implications are alarming, these
works have significant methodological shortcomings that
motivate us to develop new techniques in this work.
3.1 Measuring the Ad Ecosystem
Numerous studies have measured and broadly character-
ized the online advertising ecosystem. Guha et al. were
the first to systematically measure online ads, and their
carefully controlled methodology has been very influen-
tial on subsequent studies (including this one) [27]. Bar-
ford et al. take a much broader look at the adscape to
determine who the major ad networks are, what fraction
of ads are targeted, and what user characteristics drive
targeting [9]. Carrascosa et al. take an even finer grained
look at targeted ads by training personas that embody
specific interest profiles (e.g., cooking, sports), and find
that advertisers routinely target users based on sensitive
attributes (e.g., religion) [12]. Rodriguez et al. measure
the ad ecosystem on mobile devices [61], while Zarras et
al. analyzed malicious ad campaigns and the ad networks
that serve them [66].
Note that none of these studies examine retargeted
ads; Carrascosa et al. specifically excluded retargets
from their analysis [12].
Trackers and Tracking Mechanisms.
To facilitate
ad targeting, participants in the ad ecosystem must ex-
tensively track users. Krishnamurthy et al. have been
cataloging the spread of trackers and assessing the en-
suing privacy implications for years [38, 36, 37]. Roes-
ner et al. develop a comprehensive taxonomy of different
tracking mechanisms that store state in users’ browsers
(e.g., cookies, HTML5 LocalStorage, and Flash LSOs),
as well as strategies to block them [55]. Gill et al. use
large web browsing traces to model the revenue earned
by different trackers (or aggregators in their terminol-
ogy), and found that revenues are skewed towards the
largest trackers (primarily Google) [24]. More recently,
