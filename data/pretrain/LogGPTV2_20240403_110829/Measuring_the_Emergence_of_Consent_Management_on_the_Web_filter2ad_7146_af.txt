Table A.3: Occurence of CMPs measured in January 2020.
Comparing this to the May 2020 data in Table 1, we see that a
growing share of websites adapt CMPs outside the EU, likely
prompted by non-EU regulations such as CCPA.

Purposes Definitions
1
Information storage and access: The storage of infor-
mation, or access to information that is already stored, on
your device such as advertising identifiers, device identi-
fiers, cookies, and similar technologies.
2 Personalisation. The collection and processing of infor-
mation about your use of this service to subsequently
personalise advertising and/or content for you in other
contexts, such as on other websites or apps, over time.
3 Ad selection, delivery, reporting. The collection of in-
formation, and combination with previously collected
information, to select and deliver advertisements for you,
and to measure the delivery and effectiveness of such
advertisements.
4 Content selection, delivery, reporting. The collection
of information, and combination with previously col-
lected information, to select and deliver content for you,
and to measure the delivery and effectiveness of such
content.
5 Measurement. The collection of information about your
use of the content, and combination with previously col-
lected information, used to measure, understand, and
report on your usage of the service.
Careful readers may note that “information storage and ac-
cess” is not a purpose for personal data processing in itself,
but an artifact of the obligations imposed by Article 5(3) of
the ePrivacy Directive.
Feature Definitions
1 Offline data matching. Combining data from offline
sources that were initially collected in other contexts with
data collected online in support of one or more purposes.
2 Device linking. Processing data to link multiple devices
