### System Info
(Possible duplicate: #10256)  
I have written a custom tokenizer that builds on top of `BertTokenizer`
(returns one extra list of ids that will later be embedded in a custom model).
I have pushed it to Hub as well. Now, how can I allow others to use it? The
code for the tokenizer is uploaded to Hub along with the code for the model
(they are in the same file), but since I cannot register the tokenizer with
`AutoTokenizer` like I can do for models
(`CustomModel.register_for_auto_class("AutoModel")`), others cannot load this
tokenizer, and hence use the model.
Is there a workaround for this?
Version: 4.27.4

### Information
  * The official example scripts
  * My own modified scripts
### Tasks
  * An officially supported task in the `examples` folder (such as GLUE/SQuAD, ...)
  * My own task or dataset (give details below)
### Reproduction
The code for both the tokenizer and model can be found here:
https://huggingface.co/mcgill-
babylm/bert_ds10M_np512_nh2_nl2_hs128_postags_ungrouped/blob/main/pos_bert.py
I am able to load the model with no problems since I push it after registering
it as follows
    BertForMaskedLMWithPOSEmb.register_for_auto_class("AutoModel")
    BertForMaskedLMWithPOSEmb.register_for_auto_class("AutoModelForMaskedLM")
### Expected behavior
I should be able to register custom tokenizers with `AutoTokenizer` (which
might be a new feature request) or work around it somehow to allow other users
to use a custom tokenizer.
