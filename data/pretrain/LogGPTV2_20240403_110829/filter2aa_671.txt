**Criminal Procedure: An Overview**

**Instructor: Professor Steve Dunker**

### When Can the Police Make a Stop?

For a police officer to make a stop, they must have either:
- **Reasonable Suspicion**: A level of knowledge sufficient to induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious person under similar circumstances to believe that criminal activity is occurring. This is often described as being at least 25% sure.
- **Probable Cause**: The facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge, including reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed. This is generally more than 50% sure.

### The Totality of the Circumstances

When evaluating whether reasonable suspicion or probable cause exists, officers consider all available information, such as:
- Conduct of the suspect
- Incriminating evidence
- Confessions or admissions
- Unusual hour
- Witnesses
- Answers to questions

### When Can an Officer "Frisk" a Suspect?

An officer may conduct a frisk if they:
- Reasonably believe that criminal activity is afoot.
- Have reason to believe the suspect may be armed and dangerous.

### What is a "Frisk"?

A frisk is a pat-down search for weapons. During a frisk, the officer is only looking for weapons. If the officer feels what is plainly contraband, it may be seized.

### When Must the Police Inform You of Your Rights?

The police must inform you of your rights if you are:
- In custody
- Under interrogation

Note: Traffic stops do not require the Miranda warning.

### What Are Your Rights?

- **Right to Remain Silent**: Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- **Right to an Attorney**: You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you.

### Searches

#### What is a Search?

A search occurs when a government agent invades your privacy. For a search to be considered legal, there must be a reasonable expectation of privacy.

#### Search Incident to an Arrest

A valid arrest allows the officer to search the person arrested and the area immediately surrounding them.

#### Motor Vehicle Searches

- A warrant is not required to search an automobile.
- Probable cause is necessary.
- Officers may examine all containers that could contain evidence.

### When Can the Police Enter Your Home Without Knocking First?

Generally, police must knock and announce their presence before entering a home. However, exceptions include:
- Safety concerns
- Risk of destruction of evidence

### The Exclusionary Rule

The exclusionary rule bars the use of illegally obtained evidence in court. If evidence is obtained through an illegal search, it cannot be used in court.

### Questions for the Criminal Justice Professor

Questions should be hypothetical, meaning they are made-up or imaginary scenarios.
