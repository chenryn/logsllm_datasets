This was reported by a Google user of who embedded Flutter into their existing
app and would notice side-by-side differences between Flutter content and
Obj-C/MDC-iOS content.

I'm actually not sure which is Flutter off the top of my head (someone else
should feel free to edit this comment to label them). @willlarche mentioned
this is expected since MDC-iOS doesn't perfectly match the MD spec yet. (I'm
not sure if Flutter does, but @jason-simmons certainly spent a lot of time
trying).
