I don't know if this is a known issue and supposed to be this way, but I find
it a little bit annoying.
If you are on a small laptop screen and for example scroll through the
components page there are a few sections where you can't reach the lower half
of the navigation on the left side, simply because with all the subsections of
the current section there are to many items to display to fit onto the screen
and there is no way to scoll on the navigation itself.
If this is a stupid issue and meant this way, simply close this issue ;-)
