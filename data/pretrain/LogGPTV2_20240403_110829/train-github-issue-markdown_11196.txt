# Bug report
## Describe the bug
I have two page components PageA and PageB. PageA doesn't use antd components
but PageB does. The style file of PageB imported antd's css file:  
style-b.less
    @import '~antd/dist/antd.css';
    // ...other styles
PageB:
    import './style-b.less'
    // ...
When I first open PageB, everything runs well;  
When I first open PageA and jump to PageB (by click a link in PageA), the antd
css file is not loaded.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. Open localhost:3000/b (pageB rendered correctly)
  2. Open localhost:3000/a, click the link to jump to b (this time pageB doesn't load antd's style)
## Expected behavior
When jump to b from a, b have the antd style file loaded.
