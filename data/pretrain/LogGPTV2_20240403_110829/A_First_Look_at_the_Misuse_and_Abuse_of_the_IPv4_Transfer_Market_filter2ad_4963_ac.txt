Machines and avoid detection [59], while large providers operate a global network
that covers a massive user population. These ASes account for only 0.5% of the
blacklisted preﬁxes, but cover 55% of all the blacklisted IPs, which explains the
long tail of the distributions in Fig. 4a. Since our goal is to investigate whether
the transfer market is targeted by ASes with potentially malicious business mod-
els, we attempt to ﬁlter out ASes that are apparently legitimate but may have
a large number of blacklisted IPs. These are notably ASes with very large user
population (such as big eyeball ISPs and Tier-1 networks) and cloud providers
which can be exploited by attackers who lease temporary computing instances
for malicious purposes. To this end, we follow a ﬁltering approach similar to
the one proposed by Testart et al. [60], and we consider as non-suspicious the
1,000 ASes with the largest customer cones according to AS-Rank [31]. However,
cloud providers, CDNs and large-scale eyeballs have relatively small customer
cones. Therefore, we complement the ﬁltered ASes with: (i) the 30 ASes with
the largest amount of traﬃc (hypergiants) based on the methodology by B¨ottger
et al. [13], and the 1,000 ASes with the largest user population according to
APNIC. The ﬁltered ASNs are involved in 9% of the transfers. As shown in the

column “Filtered” of Table 1, even when ﬁltering out these ASes, the fraction
of blacklisted transferred IPs is between 2x – 3x higher than the total fraction
of transferred IPs, while the fraction of blacklisted preﬁxes is virtually identi-
cal between the ﬁltered and the non-ﬁltered datasets. This is an indication the
“non-suspicious” ASes have a proportional fraction of blacklisted transferred
and non-transferred preﬁxes. In contrast, a large number of ASes in the trans-
fer market exhibit higher aﬃnity for malicious activity which is not explained
by their business model network footprint. This observation is more apparent
when studying how blacklisted preﬁxes are distributed across the IPv4 address
space. Filtered transferred/24 preﬁxes exhibit a much higher fraction of black-
listed records compared to non-ﬁltered transferred and non-transferred preﬁxes
(Fig. 4b).

to the transfer date. The last row shows the blacklisting activity for deployed preﬁxes
based on the Internet-wide IP and port scans.
Blacklisting Timing. To explore the dynamics between malicious activity
and the IP transfers, we compare the timing of the blacklisting reports to the
transfer date. We use the eﬀective transfer date, as observed by BGP routing
changes (see Sect. 3.1), and the reported transfer time only when the origin
AS does not change at all. As shown in Fig. 6, the number of blacklisted IPs
peaks within a year of the transfer date for all types of malicious activity. Such
blacklisting activity shortly after the transfer date may happen because the
transferred addresses were unused before the transfer.
To illuminate this possibility, in the last row of Fig. 6 we plot the blacklisting
reports only for preﬁxes with IPs visible in our IP/port scans at least one month
before the transfer date. For deployed preﬁxes the peak in malicious activity
also peaks after the transfer date, but after one year. This ﬁnding indicates that
recipients of IP addresses are more prone to abuse of the IP space, which agrees
with the diﬀerence in blacklisting magnitude between buyers and sellers as shown
in Fig. 5b.
Per-Region and Per-Transfer Type Diﬀerences. We then investigate
whether the malicious activity diﬀers between regions and transfer types.
Figure 7a compares the fraction of blacklisted transferred address space between
preﬁxes exchanged as Merge & Acquisitions and as IP sales for each region with
blacklisted IPs, and for inter-region transfers. Preﬁxes exchanged within the
RIPE region as sales originate have the highest fraction of blacklisted IPs, which
is statistically signiﬁcant. In contrast, ARIN exhibits higher malicious activity
from preﬁxes transferred between siblings, although the spread of values makes
it diﬃcult to generalize this observation. For APNIC and inter-RIR transfers
we observe only non-sibling blacklisted transactions, while for AFRINIC and
LACNIC we do not have any blacklisted transferred IPs (after the AS ﬁltering
step).
Participation of Low-Reputation ASes in IPv4 Transfers. The ﬁnal part
of our analysis is to check the participation rate of low-reputation ASes (hijack-

ers, C&C and bulletproof hosters) in IP transfers. Although 85% of the ASes
visible in the BGP routing table are not involved in IP transfers, 47% of the low-
reputation ASes have been either buyers (48%) or sellers (52%). Surprisingly,
32% of these ASes participate both as buyers and sellers. This practice may
signal an attempt to recycle “tainted” address space in order to evade blacklist
ﬁlters, since blacklist providers may remove listed IPs and preﬁxes when there
is a shift in ownership [25,26]. Figure 7b shows that indeed the density of black-
listed IPs for the low-reputation buyer/seller ASes dips at the transfer date and
increases shortly thereafter.
5 Conclusion
In this paper we present a ﬁrst comprehensive measurement study of malicious
activities within the transferred IPv4 address space and the networks that are
involved in the IPv4 market. We ﬁrst combine a wide range of control-plane and
data-plane data to process the details of the reported IP transfer reports and
verify the ownership of the exchanged preﬁxes based on BGP paths and historical
WHOIS data. We ﬁnd that for more than 65% of the IP transfers, the origin
ASes and the transaction dates are inconsistent with the transfer reports. Our
results reveal at best poor practices of resource management that can facilitate
malicious activities, such as hijacking attacks, and even lead to connectivity
issues due to the increasing deployment of IRR-based ﬁltering mechanisms.
We then analyze the exchanged IPv4 address blocks against an extensive
dataset of malicious activities that span a decade, which includes IP blacklists,
honeypot data, and non-legitimate ASes based on the detection of control-plane
misbehavior. Our ﬁndings show that the ASes involved in the transfer market
exhibit consistently higher malicious behavior compared to the rest of the ASes,
even when we account for factors such as business models and network span.
A First Look at the Misuse and Abuse of the IPv4 Transfer Market
101
Our ﬁndings are likely to be a lower bound of malicious activity from within
transferred IP addresses since a number of transactions may occur without being
reported to the RIRs [23,44]. As part of our future work we aim to extend our
analysis to non-reported IPv4 transfers and develop predictive techniques for
blacklisting based on the monitoring of the IPv4 transfer market.
We believe that these insights can inform the debates and development of RIR
policies regarding the regulation of IPv4 markets, and help operators and brokers
conduct better-informed due diligence to avoid misuse of the transferred address
space or unintentionally support malicious actors. Moreover, our results can pro-
vide valuable input to blacklist providers, security professionals and researchers
who can improve their cyber-threat monitoring and detection approaches, and
tackle evasion techniques that exploit IPv4 transfers. We will make available the
data of our study at: https://github.com/vgiotsas/ip-transfers-observatory.
