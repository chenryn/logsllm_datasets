### Machines and Avoiding Detection

Large providers operate a global network that covers an extensive user base. These Autonomous Systems (ASes) account for only 0.5% of blacklisted prefixes but cover 55% of all blacklisted IPs, which explains the long tail in the distribution shown in Fig. 4a. Our goal is to investigate whether the IP transfer market is targeted by ASes with potentially malicious business models. To achieve this, we filter out ASes that are apparently legitimate but may have a large number of blacklisted IPs. These include ASes with very large user populations (such as major ISPs and Tier-1 networks) and cloud providers, which can be exploited by attackers who lease temporary computing instances for malicious purposes.

To filter these ASes, we adopt an approach similar to the one proposed by Testart et al. [60], considering the 1,000 ASes with the largest customer cones according to AS-Rank [31] as non-suspicious. However, cloud providers, CDNs, and large-scale ISPs typically have smaller customer cones. Therefore, we complement the filtered ASes with: (i) the 30 ASes with the highest traffic volume (hypergiants) based on the methodology by Böttger et al. [13], and (ii) the 1,000 ASes with the largest user population according to APNIC. The filtered ASes are involved in 9% of the transfers.

As shown in the "Filtered" column of Table 1, even after filtering out these ASes, the fraction of blacklisted transferred IPs remains 2x to 3x higher than the total fraction of transferred IPs, while the fraction of blacklisted prefixes is virtually identical between the filtered and non-filtered datasets. This suggests that the "non-suspicious" ASes have a proportional fraction of blacklisted transferred and non-transferred prefixes. In contrast, a significant number of ASes in the transfer market exhibit a higher affinity for malicious activity, which is not explained by their business model or network footprint. This observation is more apparent when studying the distribution of blacklisted prefixes across the IPv4 address space. Filtered transferred/24 prefixes exhibit a much higher fraction of blacklisted records compared to non-filtered transferred and non-transferred prefixes (Fig. 4b).

### Blacklisting Timing

To explore the dynamics between malicious activity and IP transfers, we compare the timing of blacklisting reports to the transfer date. We use the effective transfer date, as observed by BGP routing changes (see Sect. 3.1), and the reported transfer time only when the origin AS does not change. As shown in Fig. 6, the number of blacklisted IPs peaks within a year of the transfer date for all types of malicious activity. This blacklisting activity shortly after the transfer date may occur because the transferred addresses were unused before the transfer.

To further investigate this, the last row of Fig. 6 plots the blacklisting reports only for prefixes with IPs visible in our IP/port scans at least one month before the transfer date. For deployed prefixes, the peak in malicious activity also occurs after the transfer date, but after one year. This finding indicates that recipients of IP addresses are more prone to abuse the IP space, which aligns with the difference in blacklisting magnitude between buyers and sellers as shown in Fig. 5b.

### Per-Region and Per-Transfer Type Differences

We then examine whether malicious activity differs between regions and transfer types. Figure 7a compares the fraction of blacklisted transferred address space between prefixes exchanged as Mergers & Acquisitions and as IP sales for each region with blacklisted IPs, and for inter-region transfers. Prefixes exchanged within the RIPE region as sales have the highest fraction of blacklisted IPs, which is statistically significant. In contrast, ARIN exhibits higher malicious activity from prefixes transferred between siblings, although the spread of values makes it difficult to generalize this observation. For APNIC and inter-RIR transfers, we observe only non-sibling blacklisted transactions, while for AFRINIC and LACNIC, we do not have any blacklisted transferred IPs (after the AS filtering step).

### Participation of Low-Reputation ASes in IPv4 Transfers

The final part of our analysis examines the participation rate of low-reputation ASes (hijackers, C&C, and bulletproof hosters) in IP transfers. Although 85% of the ASes visible in the BGP routing table are not involved in IP transfers, 47% of the low-reputation ASes have been either buyers (48%) or sellers (52%). Surprisingly, 32% of these ASes participate both as buyers and sellers. This practice may signal an attempt to recycle "tainted" address space to evade blacklist filters, as blacklist providers may remove listed IPs and prefixes when there is a shift in ownership [25, 26]. Figure 7b shows that the density of blacklisted IPs for the low-reputation buyer/seller ASes dips at the transfer date and increases shortly thereafter.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present a comprehensive measurement study of malicious activities within the transferred IPv4 address space and the networks involved in the IPv4 market. We combine a wide range of control-plane and data-plane data to process the details of reported IP transfer reports and verify the ownership of the exchanged prefixes based on BGP paths and historical WHOIS data. We find that for more than 65% of the IP transfers, the origin ASes and transaction dates are inconsistent with the transfer reports. Our results reveal poor practices of resource management that can facilitate malicious activities, such as hijacking attacks, and lead to connectivity issues due to the increasing deployment of IRR-based filtering mechanisms.

We then analyze the exchanged IPv4 address blocks against an extensive dataset of malicious activities spanning a decade, including IP blacklists, honeypot data, and non-legitimate ASes based on the detection of control-plane misbehavior. Our findings show that the ASes involved in the transfer market consistently exhibit higher malicious behavior compared to the rest of the ASes, even when accounting for factors such as business models and network span.

Our findings likely represent a lower bound of malicious activity from within transferred IP addresses, as some transactions may occur without being reported to the RIRs [23, 44]. As part of our future work, we aim to extend our analysis to non-reported IPv4 transfers and develop predictive techniques for blacklisting based on monitoring the IPv4 transfer market.

These insights can inform debates and the development of RIR policies regarding the regulation of IPv4 markets, helping operators and brokers conduct better-informed due diligence to avoid misuse of the transferred address space or unintentionally supporting malicious actors. Moreover, our results can provide valuable input to blacklist providers, security professionals, and researchers to improve cyber-threat monitoring and detection approaches and tackle evasion techniques that exploit IPv4 transfers.
