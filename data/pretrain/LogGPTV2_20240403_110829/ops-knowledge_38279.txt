User: Sorry if my title is not correct. Below is the explanation of what i'm looking for.
I've coded a small GUI game (let say a snake game) in python, and I want it to be run on Linux machine. I can run this program by just run command "python snake.py" in the terminal.
However, I want to combine all my .py files into one file, and when I click on this file, it just run my game. I don't want to go to shell and type "python snake.py". I means something like manifest .jar in java.
Could any one help me please? If my explanation is not good enough, please let me know. I'll give some more explanation.
Assistant: If you only want it to run on a Linux machine, using Python eggs is the simplest way.
python snake.egg will try to execute the main.py inside the egg.
Python eggs are meant to be packages, and basically is a zip file with metadata files included.
