In looking at the warnings while generating documentation, there are dozens of
"/home/circleci/repo/venv/lib/python3.6/site-
packages/numpy/core/_internal.py:docstring of
numpy.core._internal._ctypes.shape:1: **WARNING: duplicate object description
of** numpy.core._internal._ctypes.shape, other instance in
/home/circleci/repo/doc/source/reference/generated/numpy.core.defchararray.chararray.ctypes.rst,
**use :noindex: for one of them**
I think this is caused by `chararray` being a subclass of `ndarray`, as
similar warnings are generated for `MaskedArray`. I tried:
  * adding `autodoc_inherit_docstrings = False` to the `conf.py`
  * messing with the `autosummary` templates
Any ideas how to turn those warnings off?
