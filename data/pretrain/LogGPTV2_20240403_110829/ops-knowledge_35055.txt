User: I have subprocess.call(["ddrescue", in_file_path, out_file_path], stdout=drclog). I'd like this to display the ddrescue in the terminal as it's running and write the output to the file drclog. I've tried using subprocess.call(["ddrescue", in_file_path, out_file_path], stdout=drclog, shell=True), but that gives me an input error into ddrescue.
Assistant: The solution that worked for me was subprocess.call(["ddrescue $0 $1 | tee -a drclog", in_file_path, out_file_path], shell=True).
