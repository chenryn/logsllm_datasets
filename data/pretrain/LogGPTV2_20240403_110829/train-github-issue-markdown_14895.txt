### Introduction
Symfony 3.3 introduced a convention of naming services with their FQCN. The
update pathway for legacy applications is simple: just start using new naming
convention and slowly all services will get new names.
### The problem
While refactoring parts of the application it's worth to clean up a little
bit. One of the steps which I perform is ensuring services are names by their
FQCNs (which simplifies the configuration due to autoregistration). However,
especially for public services, I cannot ensure old names aren't used
somewhere.
### Solution
Long time ago I assumed `deprecated` tag can be used on aliases - 4 proved me
wrong nicely throwing ` The configuration key "deprecated" is unsupported`.  
What if we actually introduced `deprecated` key on aliases to mark them as
deprecated while the service itself stays non-deprecated?
