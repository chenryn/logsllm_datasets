I would like to humbly request a componentDidReceiveProps hook, often times I
would like to do something on both componentWillMount and
componentWillReceiveProps, but because `this.props` hasn't been set yet I am
forced to pass props around instead of reading directly from `this.props`.
## Before New Hook
    componentWillMount() {
      this.setup(this.props.id);
    }
    componentWillReceiveProps(next) {
      this.setup(next.id);
    }
    setup(id) {
      UserActions.load(id);
    }
## After New Hook
    componentWillMount() {
      this.setup();
    }
    componentDidReceiveProps() {
      this.setup();
    }
    setup() {
      UserActions.load(this.props.id);
    }
In this simple example it may seem like a small thing, but often times the
passing of props runs deep and instead of conveniently referencing this.props
one is forced to plumb the props throughout the component.
Please consider adding `componentDidReceiveProps` as a hook to leverage the
same code that is leveraged in componentWillMount without forcing both to
plumb props throughout the component.
