**First-time Poster: Seeking Feedback for Improvement**

I recently installed PyCharm Edu 3.0 and Anaconda 3 on an older laptop. While attempting to access the embedded terminal within the IDE, I encountered an issue preventing me from launching it. After searching through related questions here and reviewing JetBrains documentation, I found that a common solution is to install the "Terminal" plugin. However, my version of PyCharm does not include this plugin, and I have been unable to locate it in the JetBrains plugin repository or community repositories.

If anyone has faced a similar issue or can provide guidance on how to resolve this, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.

**Assistant's Response:**

To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Native Terminal Plugin:**
   - Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`.
   - Click on `Browse Repositories`.
   - Search for and install the `Native Terminal` plugin.
   - This will enable a terminal that uses the Windows native terminal.

2. **Enable the Toolbar (if not visible):**
   - If the toolbar is not already enabled, go to `View > Toolbar`.
   - Check the `Toolbar` option to display the toolbar.

After completing these steps, a small black button (representing the terminal) should appear on the toolbar. Click this button to launch the terminal within PyCharm.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
