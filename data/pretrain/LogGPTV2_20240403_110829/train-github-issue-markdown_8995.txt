Go version 1.5
### Summary
We've run into some behavior we didn't expect from go/types importing
packages. If a package `p` has been imported (by some other package) and its
source code is present but not installed (that is, there is no package archive
such as `$GOROOT/pkg/darwin_amd64/p.a`) then Check returns an error saying it
can't find the package.
We're not sure if this is intended behavior, but we found it surprising.

We've tried to produce a minimal test case:  
https://github.com/kr/gotypesrepro
### Steps to reproduce
    1. git clone https://github.com/kr/gotypesrepro $GOPATH/src/p
    2. cd $GOPATH/src/p
    3. go run try.go # fails
    4. go install p
    5. go run try.go # now it works
### Expected output
    package testdata ("testdata")
    package testdata ("testdata")
### Actual output
    testdata/import.go:3:8: could not import p (can't find import: p)
    package testdata ("testdata")
