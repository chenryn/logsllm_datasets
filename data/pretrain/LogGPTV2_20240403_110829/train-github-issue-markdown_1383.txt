### Issue Report: Incompatibility Between Apache Airflow and SQLAlchemy 1.4.0

**Apache Airflow Version**: 2.0.1 (potentially any version)
**Kubernetes Version** (if applicable, use `kubectl version`): N/A
**Environment**: Any
- **Cloud Provider or Hardware Configuration**: Any
- **Operating System** (e.g., from `/etc/os-release`): Any
- **Kernel** (e.g., `uname -a`): Any
- **Installation Tools**: Any
- **Other Details**: Any

#### Problem Description:
Starting with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.0b1, the `postgres` prefix in database URIs is no longer supported. Instead, only the `postgresql` prefix is recognized. This change impacts all Airflow jobs that:
- Use SQLAlchemy version 1.4.0 or higher.
- Utilize a Postgres URI obtained from the `get_uri` method of a `PostgresHook` (defined in `airflow/hooks/dbapi.py`).

The `PostgresHook` class (`airflow/providers/postgres/hooks/postgres.py`) currently defines a class attribute `conn_type = 'postgres'`, which should be updated to `conn_type = 'postgresql'`.

As a result, my Airflow jobs that rely on the updated SQLAlchemy version and use `create_engine` with a Postgres database are failing.

#### Expected Behavior:
Airflow jobs using SQLAlchemy 1.4.0 or later, along with `create_engine` for Postgres databases, should function correctly. Specifically, the `get_uri` method should generate a URI starting with `postgresql://`.

While I can revert to an older version of SQLAlchemy or manually adjust the URI, it would be more convenient if Airflow could adapt to the new prefix.

#### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the `get_uri` method of any `PostgresHook` instance.
2. Observe the generated URI and the resulting error when used with SQLAlchemy 1.4.0 or higher.

#### Additional Information:
N/A
