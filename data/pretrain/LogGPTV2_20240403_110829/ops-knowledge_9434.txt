User: I have a function dosomething()  inside which am doing a os.chroot(). A process running chroot() cannot get out of chroot jail. So i want this dosomething() to run as a child process in the main program and i need to wait till the child process gets over . What is the simplest way to do this ?
Assistant: Take a look at multiprocess.Process
