### Title: Blackhat US-18: Mainframe [z/OS] Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development

**Abstract:**

Speak with any Fortune 500 company that relies on mainframes, and you will likely hear two things: (1) their business operations would be severely disrupted without their mainframes, and (2) they do not conduct any security research or vulnerability scans on these systems. This is particularly frustrating because, despite their specialized nature, mainframes are still computers and are susceptible to hacking.

Previous talks on this topic have provided a high-level overview of mainframe security, emphasizing the importance of basic security practices. This presentation builds on that foundation by delving into the specifics of reverse engineering and exploit development on the z/OS platform. 

**Key Topics:**

1. **Reverse Engineering Tools and Techniques:**
   - Introduction to available debugging tools such as dbx and ASMIDF.
   - Overview of the challenges and limitations associated with using these tools.
   - Detailed steps for conducting your own reverse engineering on the z/OS platform.

2. **Exploit Development:**
   - Techniques for developing exploits and buffer overflows using C, assembler, and JCL.
   - A step-by-step guide, including a demo program, to help attendees follow along and practice.

3. **Advanced Security Concepts:**
   - Understanding and bypassing APF authorization.
   - Methods for circumventing RACF/ACEE security controls.
   - Exploiting TSO (Time Sharing Option) and Unix System Services.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Gain proficiency in using reverse engineering tools specific to the z/OS platform.
- Develop the skills necessary to create and execute your own exploits.
- Understand the advanced security mechanisms in place on mainframes and how to bypass them.

This talk is designed to complement previous discussions on network penetration testing and privilege escalation, providing a comprehensive guide for those interested in mainframe security. By the end of the session, attendees will have a solid foundation in both reverse engineering and exploit development on the z/OS platform.
