User: How to configure scheduled tasks on a Linux server? Please provide detailed steps and sample commands.
Assistant: 1. Edit the crontab file On the Linux server, use the command `crontab -e` to edit the user's crontab list. If you are using this command for the first time, you will need to choose an editor. It is recommended to choose the easy-to-use nano editor. 2. Add a scheduled task Add a scheduled task in the crontab file, the format is as follows: ``` * * * * * command ``` - the first column indicates the number of minutes (0~59) - the second column indicates the number of hours (0~ 23) - The third column represents the date (1~31) - The fourth column represents the month (1~12) - The fifth column represents the day of the week (0~6, 0 represents Sunday) - command is the command or script path to be executed For example, the following command means to execute the specified command at 1 am every day: ``` 0 1 * * * command ``` 3. Save and exit After adding the scheduled task, use the `Ctrl+X` key combination to save and exit the editor . 4. View and modify scheduled tasks You can use `crontab -l` command to view the list of scheduled tasks of the current user. If you need to modify, delete or add new tasks, you can edit them again with `crontab -e`. Here are some sample commands: - Backup database every day at 1AM ``` 0 1 * * * /usr/bin/mysqldump -u [username] -p[password] [database] > /backup/db_backup.sql `` ` - Clean up temporary files in the /tmp directory every 30 minutes ``` */30 * * * * /usr/bin/find /tmp -type f -mtime +1 -delete ``` - Every Saturday at 11pm Shutdown ``` 0 23 * * 6 /sbin/shutdown -h now ``` Notes: - The command or script path of the scheduled task should use an absolute path to avoid being unable to execute due to different environment variables. - The weight of the scheduled task can be changed. Use the crontab command + option to change the path of the scheduled task, the value of the corresponding environment variable and other parameters. The common parameters are -u and -e parameters. Usually, ordinary users only modify the tasks under the -e option , and the current user's task resides under /usr/bin/crontab.
