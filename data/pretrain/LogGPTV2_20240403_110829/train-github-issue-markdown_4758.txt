I am currently using Atom version 0.121.0 on macOS 10.9.4. When I switch Atom to Fullscreen mode and then revert it back to the normal windowed mode, I encounter an issue where the window is restored, but the header is obscured by the menu bar, making it inaccessible.

Here are some screenshots for reference:

- **Exposé View (showing the window header is present):**

As you can see in the Exposé view, the window header is actually there, but it is overlapped by the menu bar, preventing me from accessing it.
