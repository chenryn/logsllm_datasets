**Abstract:**
Following the introduction of Bitcoin's Nakamoto Consensus (NC) protocol, hundreds of cryptocurrencies have adopted proof-of-work (PoW) mechanisms to maintain their ledgers. However, research has shown that NC fails to achieve perfect chain quality, allowing malicious miners to alter the public ledger and launch attacks such as selfish mining, double-spending, and feather-forking. Some subsequent designs, including Ethereum, Bitcoin-NG, DECOR+, Byzcoin, and Publish or Perish, aim to enhance chain quality, while others like Fruitchains, DECOR+, and Subchains claim to defend against these attacks without perfect chain quality. To address the ambiguity and establish a common understanding, this paper introduces a multi-metric evaluation framework to quantitatively analyze PoW protocols' chain quality and attack resistance. We use Markov decision processes to evaluate the security of these improved designs. Our analysis reveals that no existing PoW protocol achieves ideal chain quality or is fully resistant to all three attacks. We attribute the imperfect chain quality to unrealistic security assumptions and the inadequate attack resistance to a dilemma between "rewarding the bad" and "punishing the good." Additionally, our analysis uncovers new protocol-specific attack strategies. Based on these findings, we propose future directions for more secure PoW protocols and highlight common pitfalls in PoW security analyses.

**I. Introduction**
By November 2018, over six hundred digital currencies were using PoW to maintain consensus on a public ledger of transactions [1]. All PoW consensus protocols are derived from Bitcoin's Nakamoto Consensus (NC) [2], where participants, known as miners, compete to generate the latest block by solving a computational puzzle. The protocol ensures agreement on a sequence of blocks, called the blockchain, with each miner receiving a block reward to incentivize participation. NC was the first scheme to promise an inalterable public ledger without prior knowledge of participants' identities. However, several studies [3]–[7] have challenged the security of NC, identifying strategies that allow attackers with less than 50% of total computing power to rewrite part of the blockchain with high success rates.

Given NC's security weaknesses, numerous non-NC PoW protocols [6]–[23] have emerged, all claiming to achieve stronger security properties. However, without systematic evaluation, these advancements remain self-claimed and not widely acknowledged. Some protocols also introduce new issues, such as reducing the chain-growth rate [24], [25] or facilitating disagreements among compliant miners [26]. This uncertainty has led some new digital currencies to abandon PoW in favor of other consensus mechanisms like proof-of-stake (PoS), which, while relying on stronger security assumptions, open new attack vectors [27]–[29].

In this paper, we address this situation and explore the possibility of more secure PoW protocols. Our contributions include:

1. **A Quantitative Security Evaluation Framework:**
   - We identify that NC's key weakness lies in its low chain quality, defined as the fraction of blockchain blocks mined by compliant miners. Poor chain quality allows attackers to substitute other miners' blocks with their own, impairing NC's inalterability and enabling attacks such as selfish mining, double-spending, and feather-forking.
   - To verify the self-claimed improvements of recent non-NC protocols and detect security flaws, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes chain quality and three attack-resistance metrics: incentive compatibility, subversion gain, and censorship susceptibility.

2. **Generalizing MDP-Based Methods for Analyzing PoW Protocols:**
   - While Markov decision processes (MDPs) are commonly used to explore utility-maximizing strategies in stochastic environments, previous MDP-based analyses have primarily focused on NC with a rational, profit-driven adversary [4], [31], [32].
   - We generalize these methods in two ways: (1) by redefining the attacker's utility to include Byzantine adversaries with goals beyond economic gains, and (2) by introducing new modeling and acceleration techniques to support longer block races and cross-protocol security comparisons. This approach also opens the possibility of applying artificial intelligence techniques to systematically explore protocol vulnerabilities.

3. **Systematic Evaluation of Non-NC PoW Protocols:**
   - We categorize PoW protocols into two groups: better-chain-quality protocols and attack-resistant protocols, based on their self-claimed properties. Using our framework, we evaluate these groups and find:
     - No PoW protocol achieves perfect chain quality against a strong attacker. For example, smallest-hash tie-breaking (SHTB) [12] and unpredictable deterministic tie-breaking (UDTB) [18], [21] do not outperform NC in all attacker settings.
     - No attack-resistant protocol is fully resistant to all three attacks. We evaluate Fruitchains [20], a variant of DECOR+ [12], [21] named reward-splitting (RS), and Subchains [11]. Our analysis shows that these approaches suffer from specific drawbacks, such as removing the attacker's risk of losing block rewards in double-spending attacks, aiding feather-forking attacks, or facilitating all three attacks.

4. **Exposing Limitations in Existing PoW Protocol Security Analyses:**
   - The unsatisfactory security of PoW protocols stems from incomplete or limited security analyses. Existing analyses often focus on only one attack strategy or one or two security properties, leaving the protocols vulnerable to other attack incentives. Additionally, some analyses artificially anchor parameters to unrealistic ranges to prove protocol properties, neglecting real-world security. A comparison of our results with the designers' analyses for five protocols is summarized in Table I, highlighting the need for a multi-metric approach to security.

**II. Nakamoto Consensus’s Security Issues and Alternative PoW Protocols**

**A. Nakamoto Consensus (NC)**
NC helps network participants agree on and order confirmed transactions in a decentralized, pseudonymous manner. Each block contains its height, the hash value of the parent block, a set of transactions, and a nonce. Miners find the correct nonce to ensure the block hash is smaller than the difficulty target, which is adjusted every 2016 blocks to maintain a ten-minute average block time. Compliant miners publish blocks immediately upon discovery and are incentivized by block rewards and transaction fees.

When multiple blocks extend the same preceding block, miners adopt the main chain that is most computationally challenging to produce, commonly referred to as the longest chain. In the case of equal-length chains, miners choose the first-received chain. Blocks not on the longest chain are orphaned and discarded. By convention, Bitcoin users consider a transaction settled after it is confirmed by six blocks, including the block containing the transaction.

**B. Nakamoto Consensus’s Security Issues**
Bitcoin's designer believed that NC achieved perfect chain quality, meaning any attempt to substitute blocks would fail with high probability if more than half of the total mining power was compliant [2]. However, later studies [3]–[7] disproved this belief, discovering strategies to replace compliant miners' blocks with attackers' blocks at the end of the blockchain with high success rates. These strategies can be exploited to manipulate vote results and enable various attacks, including:

- **Selfish Mining:** A selfish miner keeps discovered blocks secret and mines on top of them, hoping to gain a lead on the public chain. Once the secret chain is sufficiently ahead, the selfish miner publishes it, invalidating compliant miners' competing blocks. This strategy, analyzed by Eyal and Sirer [6], allows the selfish miner to gain unfair block rewards, incentivizing rational miners to collectively attack for higher returns.

- **Double-Spending:** An attacker reverses a payment after the service or goods are delivered by replacing the original transaction with a conflicting one. Sompolinsky and Zohar [32] showed that an attacker with arbitrarily low mining power can profitably implement this attack by combining it with selfish mining.

- **Feather-Forking:** Proposed by Miller [30], this attack involves an attacker publicly promising to fork the blockchain to invalidate blocks confirming target transactions. Rational miners may join the attacker to avoid potential losses, even though the attack is not profitable and has a low success rate with minority mining power.

**C. Alternative PoW Protocols**
To address the security issues of NC, various alternative PoW protocols have been proposed. These protocols aim to either improve chain quality or provide better defense against attacks, but as our analysis shows, none have yet achieved both. Future work should focus on developing more robust PoW protocols that can withstand a wide range of attack scenarios.
