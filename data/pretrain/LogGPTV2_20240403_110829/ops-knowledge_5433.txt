User:  Please provide a Linux system authority management specification, including user management, group management, and file authority management.
Assistant: Linux system rights management specification: 1. User management 1.1 User naming specification: The nickname of all users should comply with the company's specification, and should be verified and approved when creating a user. 1.2 User password specification: All user passwords should have sufficient strength and complexity, at least contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters, the password length should not be less than 8 characters, and should be changed regularly. 1.3 Assignment of user rights: User rights should be assigned based on their responsibilities and work needs, and the rights should not exceed the scope of their work. 1.4 User account management: Administrators should regularly review, disable or delete user accounts that are no longer in use, and mandatory password changes must be made even if these accounts are not in use. 2. Group management 2.1 Group naming specification The names of all groups should comply with the company's specifications, and should be verified and approved when creating a group. 2.2 Group authority allocation The authority of the group should be allocated based on its responsibilities and work needs, and the most important thing is to support the principle of least authority. 2.3 Group membership management Each group should have at least one group administrator to manage its members. Administrators should also ensure that group members do not exceed the scope of their responsibilities. 3. File permission management 3.1 Assignment of file and directory access permissions The manager should only assign the minimum required permissions, thereby minimizing security risks and ensuring the security and integrity of the system. 3.2 Review of file and directory access permissions Administrators should regularly review file and directory permissions, especially those where sensitive data resides, to ensure that they are not at risk of unauthorized access. 3.3 Assignment of File and Directory Access Rights Recording The administrator must record the access rights of files and directories for auditing, to make up for undiscovered security flaws, and to prepare for future security audits. The above are the basic elements of the Linux system rights management specification, which must be regularly reviewed, updated and revised to ensure that it is consistent with the company's security policies and goals.
