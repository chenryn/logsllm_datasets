Symfony version | 2.8.12  
I created a FormType that extends the `AbstractType`. I have only a
`buildForm` method in it which adds some fields. There are some fields which
are other custom form types of mine, but those also only have the `buildForm`
method, and if they have the `configureOptions` method, it's only to set a
`data_class`.
However, when opening the page which uses this form, I'm getting the warnings
> The form option "read_only" is deprecated since version 2.8 and will be
> removed in 3.0. Use "attr['readonly']" instead.  
>  The "cascade_validation" option is deprecated since version 2.8 and will be
> removed in 3.0. Use "constraints" with a Valid constraint instead.  
>  The form option "csrf_provider" is deprecated since version 2.8 and will be
> removed in 3.0. Use "csrf_token_manager" instead.
But I'm not using any of these options. I'm even using the correct one for
`cascade_validations`. These are the options of one form field I'm adding
    [
        'data' => new Address(),
        'validation_groups' => ['productPreliminaryDeliveryAddress'],
        'mapped' => false,
        'constraints' => [new Valid()],
        'label' => false,
    ]
As you can see I'm using the correct option for constraint. Where does that
error come from and how can I supress it?
