User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can't Find Management IP Address of Wireless Access Point I have a wireless G access point in a central location in the house and I have had wireless disabled on my router.  My router supports N (2.4 ghz version) so I recently decided to put N up. I want to log into my access point so that I can make sure the channels are not the same but I cannot remember the IP address I assigned it. 

Are there any programs that will search the network and find all IP addresses that are used and what device those IP addresses belong to?

Assistant: Log into the router - it will have a device list with device names and their respective IP addresses, including your wireless G AP.
