magnitudes of four frequencies. As can be seen in Figure 17b,
the order of the magnitudes of the four frequencies remains
the same following the stabilizer operation. In addition, their
ranges are also stable and not highly inﬂuenced by wind.
Therefore, we concluded that frequencies that are higher than
6 Hz are immune to the wind’s inﬂuence and are less noisy
for any given altitude compared to low frequencies. In terms
of optimizing the SNR, it is better to use a physical stimulus
that can affect frequencies that are higher than 6 Hz.
B. Inﬂuence of Light
Next, we aimed to learn about the inﬂuence of ambient light
on the SNR. We placed the drone outside the lab, in front
of a ﬂickering LED strip (at 3.5 Hz) that was connected to
an Arduino Uno and conducted 18 experiments using various
levels of ambient light, from morning to night. We repeated the
experiment for ﬂickering smart ﬁlm. In each experiment, we
used the intercepted bitrate signal to measure the magnitude
around 7 Hz for one minute of ﬂickering and compared it with
one minute during which there was no ﬂickering. As can be
seen in Figure 17c which presents the SNR as a function of
the ambient light (in lux) calculated in the 18 experiments,
the SNR that was created from the intercepted bitrate signal
from the LED strip experiment improves as a function of
the ambient darkness. In contrast, the ﬂickering smart ﬁlm
improves as a function of the ambient light. From this set of
experiments, we concluded that by using both an LED strip
and smart ﬁlm, the inﬂuence of the watermarker can be felt
at all hours of day and night.
XI. SYSTEM EVALUATION
In this section, we present
the ﬁnal component of our
proposed method for detecting privacy invasion attacks: a
classiﬁcation algorithm that uses watermark detection in order
to determine whether a given FPV transmission is being used
to video stream a victim/target. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed privacy invasion attack detection method for
two use cases: when the target is a private house (as was the
case in [5], [7]) and when the target is a subject driving in
his/her car (as was the case in [3]).
Algorithm 4 compares the ratio between the magnitude
around the ﬂickering frequency after the periodic physical

stimulus was launched (the signal) to the baseline magnitude
around the same frequency before the periodic physical stim-
ulus was launched (the baseline/noise). Algorithm 4 is applied
after the Watermarker method has been called. The algorithm
receives a suspicious FPV transmission (FpvChannel) and two
parameters regarding the periodic physical stimulus: (1) its
startingTime (EPOC time): the time that the physical stimulus
was launched, and (2) frequency of operation. A bitrate signal
is extracted from the intercepted FpvChannel (line 3). A
bandpass ﬁlter is applied (line 4) to the bitrate signal around
the operated frequency. The ﬁltered signal is divided into
two signals: before (line 5) and after (line 6) the periodic
physical stimulus was launched. The magnitude around the
operated frequency before the periodic physical stimulus was
launched is given to noiseMagnitude (line 8), and accordingly,
the magnitude around frequency after the periodic physical
stimulus was launched is given to noiseMagnitude (line 9).
Finally, the FpvChannel is classiﬁed as being used to stream
the victim if the SNR is greater than a threshold (line 11).
1) Experimental Setup:
In order to evaluate the perfor-
mance of our method, we conducted two sets of experiments.
The ﬁrst set demonstrates how smart ﬁlm attached to a window
can be used as a means of detecting a privacy invasion attack
conducted against a private house from a neighboring property
(simulating privacy invasion attacks previously published in
the media [7], [5]). Figure 18a presents the experimental setup
in which the target is the victim’s living room which is
being video streamed by a malicious drone operator (nosey
subject) who uses a DJI Mavic Pro (conﬁgured to video
stream at 30 FPS and 720p) from his/her property (framed

in red), at a distance of around 30 meters from the victim’s
window. We consider smart ﬁlm (ﬁlm that changes its state
from transparent to mat and vice versa) that has been installed
on the victim’s window and connected to an RF controller as
a Watermarker. We consider a laptop (Dell Latitude) with an
integrated NIC (used as a radio receiver) that is located in the
victim’s home and controls the smart ﬁlm (i.e., can ﬂicker it
from mat to transparent at a given frequency) using a radio
transmitter (we used a HackRF One, a software-deﬁned radio)
as an interceptor. The experiments (which can be viewed on
an uploaded video1) show how a nosey subject (malicious
drone operator) uses a drone to ﬁlm his/her own yard (a
legitimate use of a drone), and later uses the same drone,
positioned within his/her own airspace, to peek at his/her
neighbor (illegitimate use of a drone) by focusing on the
neighbor’s living room window. In this set of experiments, the
drone was located on the property (and within the airspace)
of the malicious drone operator (framed in red), 30 meters
away from the neighbor’s living room. The smart ﬁlm is used
as a ﬂickering object that is operated at a frequency of 1.3
Hz. The spectrogram of the intercepted bitrate array from the
entire experiment, with a bandpass ﬁlter around the 2.6 Hz
frequency, is presented in Figure 18b.
The second set of experiments demonstrates how a siren
installed on the top of a car can be used as a means of detecting
a privacy invasion attack conducted against a subject while
he/she is driving in his/her car (simulating the privacy invasion
attack that was conducted against a cheating spouse in [3]).
Figure 19a presents the experimental setup. We consider a
target (the victim’s moving car) that is being video streamed
by a malicious drone operator who uses a DJI Spark
(conﬁgured to video stream at 30 FPS) to spy on the victim.
For the Watermarker we use a siren that is an LED strip
connected to an Arudino Uno microcontroller (used to ﬂicker
the siren at a given frequency). We utilize a laptop (Dell
Latitude) with an integrated NIC (used as a radio receiver)
that is located in the victim’s car and can trigger the siren
as an interceptor. The experiments (see the uploaded video2)
show how a victim that is being followed by a nosey malicious
drone operator who uses the drone to video stream the victim
while driving (the victim’s route is presented in Figure 19a).
After 20 seconds of driving, the laptop triggers a green siren
that is operated at a frequency of 3.9 Hz. The spectrogram of
the intercepted bitrate array (intercepted by the laptop) from
the entire experiment with a bandpass ﬁlter around the 7.8 Hz
frequency is presented in Figure 19.
2) Results: Based on the intercepted bitrate arrays that were
obtained from the two experiments, we extracted magnitudes
around the watermarked frequencies before and after the
physical stimulus was started for durations of 1-5 seconds.
The results are presented in Figure 20a. As can be seen in
the ﬁgure, two seconds of the physical stimulus are sufﬁcient
for increasing the signal’s magnitude (after the physical stim-
ulus began) over the baseline magnitude (before the physical
stimulus began). In addition to the experiments that simulated
illegitimate uses of a drone, we conducted experiments that
simulate legitimate drone use as follows. In the private house
experiment, we conducted an additional set of experiments in
which the neighbor used his/her drone to ﬁlm his/her own
garden (legitimate use of a drone). In the car experiment, we
conducted an additional set of experiments in which the drone
was used to ﬁlm its operator (legitimate use of a drone).
We consider a privacy invasion attack detection system a
system that can detect every privacy invasion attack. In order to
accomplish this, we tuned the threshold variable from line 11
of Algorithm 4 to the minimum SNR calculated from the set of

experiments that we conducted previously on the illegitimate
use of a drone. By setting the parameter’s threshold at
the minimal SNR value observed by triggering a physical
stimulus, we force the detection of each privacy invasion attack
that occurs. In order to test the false alarms associated with
this, we used the set of experiments that simulated legitimate
drone use. We divided the intercepted bitrate array from the
experiments that we conducted previously on the legitimate
use of a drone into a duration of 10 seconds. We applied
Algorithm 1 on the intercepted signals with the baseline and
signal magnitudes that were extracted from various durations
(15 seconds for each). The FPR results of the private house
experiment are presented in Figure 20b, and the FPR results of
the car experiment are presented in Figure 20c. As can be seen
from the results, the FPR rate goes below the value of 0.1 very
quickly: within 2-3 seconds of ﬂickering in the car experiment
and within two seconds in the private house experiment. Based
on these results, we concluded that a privacy invasion attack
detection system that detects every privacy invasion attack can
be tuned so that it leads to a minimal amount of false alarms.
XII. COUNTERMEASURES
i.e.,
In this section, we discuss countermeasure methods that can
be used by the drone’s operator to evade detection resulting
from the bursty bitrate that is caused by our carefully crafted
physical stimulus. The most effective way to evade detection
is by eliminating video compression,
transmitting the
raw video stream from the drone to its operator (transmitting
just I-frames). However, none of the commercial drones sold
today support the functionality of switching the transmitted
video stream to a constant bit rate instead of a variable
bitrate. This is likely due to the fact that providing a high-
quality resolution video stream to the drone’s operator is
important in order to enable the operator to safely maneuver
the drone and avoid collision, and a high resolution video
stream requires compression. In addition, since the 1990s,
applying compression to a video stream prior to transmission
has been mandatory, and it is supported by all next generation
video encoders; therefore, the variable bit rate side effect is
not about to disappear anytime soon.
Another option for evading detection involves using a drone
equipped with two video cameras. The ﬁrst video camera is
used for maneuvering the drone by transmitting the raw video
at a constant bitrate (CBR) at a very low resolution without
applying any compression. This camera is not focused on the
target, in order to prevent it from capturing the ﬂickering
object. The second video camera is used to spy on the target
and stores the video stream on the SD card at a high resolution
using compression. While this method might be effective
for static objects (e.g., the window of a building), its main
disadvantage is that it is not effective with a moving target
(e.g., a passing car), since the video stream presented to the
drone’s operator is transmitted from a video camera that does
not capture the moving target. The abovementioned reasons
also explain why evading detection by occasionally disabling
the video channel from the drone’s operator when using a
single camera won’t be an effective countermeasure.
XIII. LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
Drones manufactures use various protocols other than Wi-
Fi for FPV transmission. DJI, for example, uses DSSS and
FHSS modulations with its own protocol for FPV transmission
[74]. Some additional knowledge regarding the modulation is
required in order to apply our method and create a bitrate array
from intercepted trafﬁc, i.e., demodulating the signal from the
physical layer (radio) to the data link layer (binary). In the case
of DSSS, the chip sequence is required in order to demodulate
the radio transmission to data, otherwise our method can not be
applied. In future work, it would be interesting to implement
a technique that was suggested at DEF CON 25 [75] and
extracts chip sequence from DSSS transmission. In addition,
our work can be extended by adding a threshold for a maximal
amount of time for reasonable snooping behavior (deﬁned by
the victim) that will ensure that the system only issues alerts
for video capturing that exceeds the threshold; this will allow
reasonable maneuvering near the target.

XIV. APPENDIX - STAGES OF VIDEO COMPRESSION
ALGORITHMS
A. Intra-Coding Process (Creating I-Frames)
Intra-coding contains the following stages [76], [34]:
B. Inter-Coding Process (Creating B and P-Frames)
The process of generating a delta frame is similar to
the intra-coding process, with minor changes. Between the
quantization stage and the entropy coding stage the following
stages are added:
1) Reference block matching - A similar block in another
frame is identiﬁed.
2) Motion vector extraction - The difference between the
two blocks is extracted by calculating the prediction
error. This is the data that is used to describe the delta
frame (prediction error from another frame).
