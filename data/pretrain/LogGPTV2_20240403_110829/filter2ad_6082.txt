## Abstract
In the ongoing arms race between spammers and the multi-million dollar anti-spam industry, the number of unsolicited email messages (commonly known as "spam") and phishing attempts has increased significantly over the past decade. In this paper, we demonstrate that our friend-in-the-middle (FITM) attacks on social networking sites (SNSs) can be used to harvest social data in an automated manner. This social data can then be exploited for large-scale attacks such as context-aware spam and social-phishing. We validate the feasibility of our attack on Facebook and identify potential consequences using a mathematical model and simulations. Alarmingly, all major SNSs are vulnerable to our attack due to inadequate network layer security.

## 1. Introduction
Criminals and direct marketers continue to flood mailboxes with unsolicited bulk emails (such as spam and phishing) in the hope of financial gain. Their strategy typically involves sending out a vast number of unsolicited emails to maximize profit from the small fraction that fall for their scams. The pool of target email addresses is often harvested using web crawlers or trojans, and sometimes even through dictionary-based guessing of valid targets. Previous research suggests that social networking sites (SNSs) may change the landscape of spam attacks in the near future. SNSs contain a wealth of sensitive information, including contact details (email addresses, instant messaging accounts, etc.) and personal information that can be used to enhance the credibility of spam messages.

A successful extraction of sensitive information from SNSs would result in spam attacks based on a pool of verified email addresses, potentially increasing the success rate of these attacks. Gaining access to the personal information stored in SNSs and impersonating a social network user presents a significant challenge. Researchers like Gross and Acquisti [6] and Jones and Soltren [10] were among the first to highlight the vulnerabilities in SNSs. While their techniques were relatively straightforward (automated scripts to retrieve web pages), their findings led to security improvements in SNSs.

Existing attempts to extract information from SNSs focus on the application layer and can be mitigated by adjusting the specific social network's application logic. Recent publications have introduced more sophisticated methods, such as inferring a user's social graph from public listings [4] or cross-platform profile cloning attacks [3]. The leakage of personal information from these platforms creates a significant dilemma, as this information forms the ideal base for further attacks. Jagatic et al. [9] demonstrated that they could increase the success rate of phishing attacks from 16% to 72% using "social data." In social engineering, additional available information on targets can lead to automated social engineering attacks [7].

The main obstacle for large-scale spam attacks based on SNSs is the various access protection measures provided by SNSs to keep sensitive information private or at least limit access to a closed circle of friends. Our friend-in-the-middle (FITM) attack overcomes this obstacle by hijacking HTTP sessions at the network layer, which most SNS providers fail to secure.

The main contributions of our work are:
- Demonstration of FITM attacks on social networks and their use for context-aware spam and social phishing on a large scale.
- Evaluation of the feasibility of our attack on Facebook.
- Simulation to estimate the impact of a FITM-based spam campaign.
- Discussion of protection measures and mitigation strategies.

## 2. FITM Attacks
We define friend-in-the-middle (FITM) attacks as active eavesdropping attacks against social networking sites. While active eavesdropping attacks against web services are well-studied and known for decades [2], we claim that active eavesdropping attacks against SNSs are fundamentally different for two reasons. First, SNS session hijacking allows various sophisticated attacks on the application layer. Second, social networking traffic can be intercepted virtually anywhere. For example, according to [1], Facebook was responsible for 30% of global web traffic at the time of writing.

Our FITM attack exploits the lack of protection in the communication link between users and SNS providers. By hijacking session cookies, it becomes possible to impersonate the victim and interact with the social network without proper authorization. While the risk of hijacking social networking sessions appears to be another privacy threat, we outline that FITM attacks enable large-scale spam attacks.

### HTTP Session Hijacking Attacks on SNSs
As a precondition, the attacker needs access to the communication between the SNS and the user. This can be achieved either passively (e.g., by monitoring unencrypted wireless networks) or actively (e.g., by installing malicious software on the victim’s computer). The adversary then clones the HTTP header containing the authentication cookies and can interact with the social network, unbeknownst to the SNS operator or user. The victim is unable to detect or prevent such attacks, and the attacker can use the social network to its full extent from the victim’s perspective.

With HTTP session hijacking, it becomes possible to both retrieve information (data acquisition from the social network) and insert malicious requests on behalf of the user (data publication into the social network). However, in the case of our FITM attack, additional scenarios become available to attackers, which are specific to social networking sites:
- **Friend Injection:** To infiltrate a closed network.
- **Application Injection:** To extract profile content.
- **Social Engineering:** To exploit collected information.

### Friend Injection
The rudimentary security and privacy protection measures of SNSs are based on the concept of "friendship," meaning that sensitive information is made available only to a limited set of accounts (friends) specified by the SNS user. Once an attacker hijacks a social networking session, they can add themselves as a friend on behalf of the victim, thus infiltrating the target’s closed network [8]. The injected friend can then be misused to access profile information or post messages within the infiltrated network of friends.

### Application Injection
By installing a custom third-party application [11], written and controlled by the attacker, it is possible to access the data in an automated fashion. Such an application has access to sensitive information (birthday, email address, demographic information, pictures, interests) and, in most SNSs, to information about the friends of the application user. Third-party applications, such as online games, have become popular amusements within SNSs, and hiding a malicious application without any visible activity to the user is possible. Thus, the application is likely to remain undetected within a pool of installed third-party applications. This enables the attacker to extract profile content stealthily, as this retrieval method does not cause as much noise as a burst of separate HTTP requests. Even worse, the attacker might install the application, take all the necessary data, and remove the application afterward, making the process completely undetectable to the user and most likely to the SNS providers as well.

### Social Engineering
Traditionally, social engineers relied on context information gathered through dumpster diving or quizzing people over the phone. With FITM attacks, the context information harvesting process becomes automated. We claim that FITM attacks allow for sophisticated social engineering attacks. Two such social engineering attacks based on information extraction from social networking sites are context-aware spam and social phishing. These advanced versions of traditional spam and phishing messages are described below, as they ultimately show the devastating effect a large-scale FITM attack might cause.

#### Context-Aware Spam
Context-aware spam can be generated from data harvested with FITM attacks, increasing the effectiveness of the spam. Brown et al. [5] identified three types of context-aware spam attacks:
- **Relationship-Based Attacks:** Based on relationship information.
- **Unshared-Attribute Attacks:** Using content extracted from social networking sites, such as geographic information or a user’s birthday.
- **Shared-Attribute Attacks:** Using shared attributes.

The social network itself might be used for sending the spam, e.g., by writing the message to other users' walls or sending it via private messages.

#### Social-Phishing
Phishing is a common threat on the Internet where an attacker tries to lure victims into entering sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, into a faked website under the control of the attacker. It has been shown [9] that social phishing, which includes some kind of "social" information specific to the victim, can be extremely effective compared to regular phishing. For example, the message might appear to be sent from a person within the social environment of the victim, such as a friend or a colleague from work. The social graph is valuable not only to the social network operator but also to the attacker, especially if it contains additional information like a valid email address or recent communication between the victim and the impersonated friend. With automated data extraction from social networks, a vast amount of usable data becomes available to spammers.

### Large-Scale Spam Campaigns through FITM Attacks
Figure 1 illustrates the outline of a spam campaign exploiting our novel FITM attack:
1. **Network Monitoring:** A network connection is monitored. Once the FITM application detects an active social networking session, it clones the complete HTTP header, including the session cookie.
2. **Session Hijacking:** The cloned HTTP header serves as a valid authentication token for the SNS provider and is used to temporarily hijack the SNS user’s session.
3. **Data Extraction:** To extract the profile content and information on the target’s friends, a custom third-party application is added to the target’s profile. Once all information has been extracted, the application is removed from the profile. Additional queries are used to fetch the email addresses of the target’s friends if they cannot be retrieved through the third-party application.
4. **Spam and Phishing Emails:** The extracted email addresses and account content are used to generate tailored spam and phishing emails. While the spam messages contain the actual payload of the attack, the phishing emails are used to steal credentials of the target’s friends for further propagation (the FITM attack starts again from step 3 with the phished SNS account credentials).

We decided to evaluate the impact of a large-scale spam campaign based on Facebook. FITM attacks based on Facebook serve as a good example because it is the largest SNS at the time of writing, HTTPS is only used to protect login credentials, and Facebook supports custom applications. Furthermore, injections of third-party applications into Facebook profiles promise access to a plethora of personal information. Within the Facebook application framework, third-party applications can access the following information:
- **Basic Context Information:** Full name, geographical location, birthday, affiliations, education, etc.
- **Likes and Interests:** Favorite books, movies, TV series, music, quotations, etc.
- **Private Content:** Sent and received messages, photos, videos, etc.

In addition, third-party applications within Facebook are allowed to access the information of a user’s friends as well. Thus, an application injection in Facebook enables the extraction of a pool of valuable context information from the targeted user and their friends. Email addresses of users are not accessible through third-party applications and must be collected by using the hijacked user session. We created a proof-of-concept implementation of our novel FITM attack in the Python scripting language for Facebook.
