As we headed to his office, I barely had the confidence to make
small talk. I’d agreed to put a brief moratorium on calling myself
an idiot internally, but it hadn’t immediately kicked into action.
“Good day, so far?” I struggled out, feigning a nonchalant spirit
I did not feel.
“Yes,” he replied tartly, without looking away from our current
course. I said nothing in reply; I just nodded. As we reached his
office, I committed to the only rational path I could think of at the
time: the fourth law of AMs: never break pretext. “Let’s see these
Attack Strategy 201
papers, Diana,” he said, looking me dead in the eyes, hunched over
his desk and giving off an air of being inconvenienced.
“Sure thing!” I slammed the briefcase down on the desk. At the
time, I did so mainly to show him I was not scared of his tone; he
seemed to want to intimidate me. Looking back, my action was a
bit weird. He was just a little abrasive, but my adrenaline was too
high to work these things out in real time. Fighting fire with fire just
makes a bigger, hotter fire, it turns out.
I clicked the case open and inside was what looked like the
whole of the Amazon rainforest scattered around it. “Ah! Yeah,
there was an incident downstairs. I might just take a minute to reor-
ganize these, if you don’t mind?” I wasn’t really asking as much as
saying, “I am going to make up a new plan in my mind behind the
lid of this case. Please allow me to sit here and do that.”
“I actually don’t have all day, Diana. You’ve interrupted me on
my way to a very important meeting.”
Jeff was becoming a very good target.
“I am so sorry! How about this? I have all the papers on this
USB. It will be faster to reprint them than to reorganize them. Do
you mind?” I asked as I looked from the USB to his computer a few
times to make my point.
“I do mind! What are these papers about? Why are you here
today? Why have I not been told about this?” His face flashed anger
like a blinking light.
“All good questions. Listen, maybe I’ve caught you at a bad
time, but I am just going to step out now as you obviously have a
lot going on and I don’t want to frustrate you further.” I gathered
the case and placed the USB back into its safehouse: my pocket.
Unceremoniously, I opened his office door; before stepping out and
walking down the hall like a bat out of hell, I said, “I’ll have the firm
reach out to you for a better time,” and then I crossed the threshold
to what seemed like freedom from the indignation of Jeff.
“As you should!” he spat back, his words chasing me down
the corridor.
“That did not go to plan at all!” I said half-j okingly to myself.
Back to the bathrooms. Upon sitting on the very uncomfortable
202 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
throne of porcelain shame, at the end of the cubicle line, I thought
about two good things I’d learned from my brief time with Jeff: he
did not lock his office door, and he definitely had a meeting to go
to. I let 10 minutes go by, slid out of my top layer of clothing, folded
it down and slid it into the briefcase, tied my hair up, and made my
way back to Jeff’s office.
The good thing about the setup in the office was that the middle
of it was like a large pit for people, with the peripherals only offices.
There was one sort of tunnel that shielded some of the executive
offices from pit view. Jeff’s had a partial view of the floor, but his
space was private enough from most angles that few people would
likely see me parading around his office as an unwanted guest for
the second time in a day. There were also a few communal hubs
splashed around the huge floor. I made my way to the closest and
smallest hub that was currently unused. Slid in, pushed the brief-
case to the far end of the table, and waited a beat. I pulled out a sheet
of paper from it, placed it next to the case, and left it there, hoping
that people, for a while at least, would just think the hub was occu-
pied and keep on walking. I didn’t want to carry it into Jeff’s office
again and leave it in the bathroom; that would have been far more
suspicious. I slid out from the table and chair and walked toward
Jeff’s office. As I approached, keeping my body pointing forward
as if I my intention was not to go into his office, I could tell he
had vacated it. I pivoted on the spot and raced into it, flipped the
light switch off, plucked the USB from my pocket, and shoved it into
his computer.
Jeff also had not locked his computer. I snapped a picture and
was just about on my merry way when his phone lit up the room like
a ’90s disco. The caller’s number appeared in big, bold, black digits
and, what’s more, I recognized it. Without having to double- check,
my gut told me what I absolutely did not want to know. It was secu-
rity. “Dammit, Jeff, why!” I whispered to myself. I retreated from the
office and made my way through the pit of people paying little atten-
tion to me, thankfully. I got back into the little hub and gathered my
things. Sitting there for a second, I pondered my best move. I had
absolutely no way to predict how long Jeff’s meeting would take,
Attack Strategy 203
but I did know I did not want to be on the floor when he made his
way back to the office, lest he see me.
Back to the toilet cubicle.
Summary
• As an ethical attacker, you advance businesses’, institutions’,
and governments’ fundamental and enduring security needs:
the protection of livelihoods, information, and data.
• Effectively, your goal is always to enhance security. You are an
instrument for ensuring security. Accordingly, the primary pur-
pose of an ethical attacker is to deter threats against an organi-
zation and its interests, and to help them defeat such threats
should deterrence fail, by empowering them with awareness of
what an attack looks and feels like.
• There are asymmetric challenges in being a target and an
attacker, often skewed to the attacker’s benefit. This is a legit-
imate concern for businesses the world over. But, alas, just
worrying about it won’t do.
• As ethical attackers, you are to increase your targets’ capabilities
to counter these threats and adapt to them defensively
via training.
• Much goes into attack strategy, including all the AMs Laws. Fur-
thermore, to defend and protect your clients after they’ve been
your targets, your objective must become the promotion of sta-
bility and the ability to defeat real adversaries.
Key Message
Attackers always have a gain in mind—a lso known as the objec-
tive. The attack strategy is only concerned with how to achieve that
objective in the most efficient way.
Even in this data- driven era, many people can be tricked by
mass emails and calls that seem to apply to their environment—a n
important point to consider in an attack.
Chapter 9
Psychology in Attacks
T
he job isn’t always just to “get in.” Usually there’s work to be
done after the initial breach. Access is just the first hurdle.
Following an initial compromise, you will try to gain traction
and maintain your place within the environment. For example, after
entering into a system, a pentester will try to increase his privileges
to administrator level to install an application, modify, exfiltrate,
or hide data. A physical pentester will attempt a similar endeavor,
typically by getting deeper into the building, penetrating it until the
asset, location, or data has been reached. It starts with what is called
gaining a foothold, and this chapter looks at the tactics you, as an
ethical attacker, can use to gain a foothold and some tactics that will
help you establish a firmer one.
Setting The Scene: Why Psychology Matters
We’ve looked at the process of gaining a contract or other legally
binding correspondence, specifically the scope and how that
directly affects what you can do as an attacker, while noting it does
not hamper the mindset; rather, it should make your AMs perform
at a more creative level. We’ve also looked at what makes OSINT
205
206 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
important and what your AMs should provide you with in regards
to OSINT finds and searches, routes, and rabbit holes— specifically
weaponization and leveraging through the tie-b ack method.
Now, though, I want to turn to the things you as an ethical
attacker (EA) must do to gain a foothold within an organization and
how to maintain your position and then increase it. In network pen
testing, access can take various forms, and the prosperous attacker
will often creatively come up with multiple attack vectors. Once
they have completed comprehensive recon and know all the ports,
services, and apps, they may turn to the vulnerability databases to
look for known vulnerabilities and exploits. Their attack methodol-
ogy will differ based on whether they have remote access or local
access and if they have physical access to the network. But in any
case, it’s widely accepted that if an attacker can circumvent security,
all bets are off. This last point is why your job as an EA is so vital –
in the physical or network category; they are not mutually exclu-
sive. They can be complementary or extremely potent when used
together. Of course, sometimes your client, your skill, or your objec-
tive means that both options in tandem aren’t available and so only
one type of attack will be performed. In any case, gaining a foothold
and penetrating further into the organization (or operation) has
some identical tactics, regardless of the mode used.
My experience and conversations with people in the com-
munity tell me that gaining access physically as an attacker is no
more anxiety- inducing than testing the network—it’s completely
dependent on the person executing the attack. This is where offen-
sive attacker mindsets (OAMs) and defensive attacker mindsets
(DAMs) come into play (see Chapter 2, “Offensive vs. Defensive
Attacker Mindset”). Contrary to popular opinion, it is advan-
tageous to plan something that might rely on seizing an oppor-
tunity in the moment, which sounds utterly absurd at first, but
bear with me.
As in football, where a team trains, practices things that might
never happen, such as an intercept, passing, and possession play,
all the time knowing that the games they train for won’t necessarily
Psychology in Attacks 207
turn into the games they play, you too must plan this way. You must
strategize how you will get access and gain more—this type of plan-
ning is one of the most fundamental and vital steps you will take as
an EA, even if the actual event(s) are nothing like your imaginings.
Planning leads to flexibility. This method goes all the way back to
one of the first mental models I talked about and have threaded
throughout this book: a game of mental chess. Think through all
the options you may have based on the information you’ve col-
lected. Imagine the situation unfolding in all directions, and envis-
age your reactions to all the good and bad, positive and negative
scenarios you can come up with (keep them based in reality of
course) because here’s the thing: your reactions matter most. Peo-
ple will do, say, and act however they feel they should most of the
time. You must react how you think you should. Going through the
motions in your mind will help you react in a way that’s best for the
objective more than any other type of preparation. More than how
important your reactions are is how important your reaction time
is. This is the key to attack psychology, because as a social engi-
neer, for example, you are already reading a person’s non- verbals,
assessing and analyzing them. It’s part and parcel of the job. Hav-
ing your reaction manufactured and ready in the nick of time may
seem like a big ask, but I proffer we do this much of the time in
social situations: we get ready for the laugh when someone is tell-
ing us a colorful story enthusiastically; we get ready to be outraged
when our friends tell us a scandalizing story; we get in line with
someone else’s happiness as they are telling us the reason for it. It’s
not always logical, but it’s part of the human condition. Therefore,
it’s not as big an ask as you may have first thought to be ready with
a reaction when testing.
It can be applied to network pen testing, as an example, too.
Your reaction time matters as it plays heavily into the “thinking
on your feet” approach that is so critical in that sort of testing. For
example, password cracking is great but it can take anywhere from
minutes to years to perform; a hacker with the ability to problem
solve and react quickly might work out the easiest thing to do it to
208 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
move around it. Spoofing attacks are a great example: you may be
able to take advantage of misconfigurations of workstations on the
internal network in order to collect password hashes, which can
then be taken offline and cracked, but you could also search for
admin consoles with default credentials.
Lateral movement techniques are definitely not lacking in num-
ber or diversity, and they typically follow the same process: gain
access to a low- privileged asset with low protection, escalate privi-
leges and seek out targets of interest on the network. The type of
lateral movement may need to be decided on quickly—you will
nearly always have to do internal recon after initial access, and that
can be noisy.
From another perspective, unethical hackers process informa-
tion and use it unnervingly quickly. According to research by the
Federal Trade Commission, it took only nine minutes before the
hackers tried to access the information from a fake data breach
(https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/05/how-f ast-w ill-
identity-t hieves-u se- stolen-i nfo). First, they created a database
of information of about 100 fake consumers. To make it seem legiti-
mate, the Financial Trade Commission used popular names based
on Census data, addresses from across the country, phone numbers
that corresponded to the addresses, intuitive email addresses based
on the information, and they provided payment information, too.
They then posted the data on two different occasions on a website
that is used to make stolen credentials public. After the second post-
ing, it took only nine minutes before the information was accessed.
We have to think like this, too. This is how we, the ethical hackers,
get ahead on both the offensive and defensive curves.
You must have a plan in mind for both ingress and egress but
take the opportunities when they arise. It’s also vital to note that
access does not equal privilege escalation. You can have limited
access both physically and on the network. However, it can be
a little harder to cover your tracks if you have limited access on a
physical job. I once entered a building through the back entrance.
A very helpful man (a lucrative target within the environment) held
Psychology in Attacks 209
it open for me as he left, presumably for the day. It feels pretty good
when getting in is that easy.
Continuing this account, upon getting inside, I saw the only
room open to me was the cafeteria, and the only open exit led back
to the street. There were two more doors inside, but both were
locked. One was a solid door at the top of a staircase, but the other
had a small window. Through it I could see all the way into recep-
tion, but I couldn’t get there because I didn’t have a card. Worse still,
it was quite late in the day when I gained access, so I had missed the
lunchtime folk passing through. The building lacked security per-
sonnel, so I did what any respectable social engineer testing physi-
cal security would do: I made myself a cup of coffee and sat at the
closest table to the connecting door.
I did this for two reasons:
• If someone came in, I could swiftly get up and catch the door
before it closed behind them.
• Coffee tastes better when it is free.
Eventually someone did come in, and I managed to make it look
like I was just getting ready to leave anyway and got through the door
before it slammed shut. However, what is most notable is that my
initial access did not guarantee privilege escalation; it merely upped
the odds. I did not know the layout of the building because there was
no OSINT or outside observation to tell me that, so I couldn’t plan for
a better route in. The back entrance seemed like the most attractive
and least bold entry point. However, it was only on-t he- spot think-
ing that led me to sit with a coffee, which is a very inconspicuous
thing to be doing in a cafeteria, and remain close to the door so that
I could catch it— which in the end permitted me access. I didn’t plan
it, it’s not particularly brilliant, but it is a way of thinking; it’s a way
of anticipating progress and waiting for the payoff.
However, with a bit of planning and a few games of mental
chess beforehand, I might have concluded that was the best route
forward, or I may have chosen to leave and then try to gain access
through the front door at a better time.
210 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
Ego Suspension, Humility & Asking for Help
There is something else that complements the planning and execu-
tion. It will be one of the most significant and powerful tools in your
AMs arsenal: ego suspension.
Ego suspension is the ability to suppress one’s own wants, needs,
and motivations and place priority on the other person. I consider
it one of the most powerful techniques for building rapport, and in
terms of AMs, it falls under the fifth skill of self awareness. Oddly
enough, as an attacker, you will likely find that you want your tar-
gets to perceive you as humble. This trait is often associated with
honesty in my experience and a way to fly easily under the radar.
Effectively, ego suspension can ostensibly neutralize your threat
shadow (your threat shadow refers to the activities, actions, contri-
butions, and communications taken as an attacker even though you
are acting through a pretext).
Ego suspension is easy in theory. It’s the act of intentionally
placing the focus on the other person, which often serves to further
increase your own trustworthiness. The ability to suspend one’s ego
