### Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) Framework

The Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) framework, proposed by Goel et al. [52], is a conceptual model used to describe complex systems through three key pillars: 
1. **Structure**: The components that make up the system.
2. **Behavior**: The changes in the system over time.
3. **Function**: The effect of the system on its environment.

This framework is frequently employed by cognitive psychologists to describe and compare mental models with actual system descriptions.

### Application of the SBF Framework

Hmelo-Silver et al. [53] utilized the SBF framework to model the understanding of complex systems among novices and experts. Their findings indicated that:
- **Novices** tend to focus on the concrete aspects related to the structure of the system, often simplifying causality and assuming central control.
- **Experts** are more likely to discuss behavioral aspects of the system.

### Applying the SBF Model to HTTPS

When applying the SBF model to HTTPS, we can categorize the components as follows:
- **Structural Components**: End users' computers or servers hosting web pages.
- **Behavioral Aspects**: Perceivable browser indications such as warning messages or security indicators.
- **Functional Aspects**: Authentication of end users and encryption of the communication path, which provides protection against attack vectors like eavesdropping and traffic injection.

### Study Results

Our study results align with those presented by Hmelo-Silver et al. [53]:
- **End Users**: Frequently included structural aspects and assumed a central entity for encryption. They rarely described behavioral or functional aspects, indicating a limited understanding of security indicators and the purpose of HTTPS.
- **Administrators**: Focused more on behavioral aspects and provided abstract representations of state transitions (e.g., sequence diagrams of protocols). However, their descriptions often lacked functional aspects and were decoupled from the actual purpose of the protocol. Notably, none of the expert participants clearly identified when encryption begins during the protocol execution.

### Threat Models

After completing the drawing tasks, participants were asked warm-up questions about attacker models, followed by a task to mark where an attacker could eavesdrop. The results, shown in Figure 7, indicate:
- **Communication Endpoints**: The most frequently mentioned vulnerable component, with 26 out of 54 end user drawings and 10 out of 35 expert drawings featuring this.
- **End User Perceptions**: Often stated that attackers could eavesdrop anywhere within the communication process.
- **Expert Perceptions**: Tended to differentiate more and name specific attackers or attack models.

Participants visualized attackers using arrows or circles, and some used drawn representations such as eyes, exclamation marks, or stick figures. Endpoint attackers were often associated with malware, infected devices, shoulder surfing, and even physical violence.

### Discussion and Implications

#### Differences Between Groups

- **Administrators**: Generally had protocol-based and correct mental models, though sometimes sparse.
- **End Users**: Had mental models that were often not only sparse but also incorrect or non-existent. Some end users thought about HTTPS and web encryption for the first time during our study.

#### Correct Mental Models

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Both groups had a basic understanding.
- **Threat Awareness**: Better than expected, with many end users aware of the vulnerability of communication endpoints.
- **Influence of Media and Marketing**: Higher media coverage of message encryption (e.g., WhatsApp) may have influenced end users' understanding.

#### Incorrect Mental Models

- **Underestimation of Security Benefits**: Participants with incorrect models underestimated the security benefits of HTTPS and assumed omnipotent attackers could eavesdrop at multiple stages.
- **Phishing Misconception**: One end user believed HTTPS could protect against phishing websites, leading to an unjustified sense of security.
- **Mistrust in Security Indicators**: Many end users did not trust or understand the importance of security indicators.

#### Missing and Sparse Mental Models

- **Keys and Certificates**: Often not part of the mental models, reducing the likelihood of manual verification.
- **Administrators' Understanding**: While some administrators mentioned keys and certificates, they often used them as buzzwords and struggled to explain their role in secure configurations.

### Potential Countermeasures and Improvements

1. **Suggested Workflow Changes for Tools and APIs**:
   - Simplify the interplay of functional protocol components.
   - Provide tangible explanations for the role of certificates and PKI.
   - Enhance usability with tools like Letâ€™s Encrypt and Certbot, but ensure users still understand the importance of these components.

2. **Trust Establishment**:
   - Use UX cues to help construct valid mental models.
   - Enforce state-of-the-art encryption by default and abandon insecure protocols like HTTP.
   - Align with recent innovations, such as Google's approach to marking HTTP sites as insecure.

### Limitations

- **Sampling Method**: Despite efforts to recruit a diverse sample, the sample was skewed towards more educated social classes and female end users, with no non-male administrators.
- **Cultural Effects**: The sample was recruited in Central Europe, which has higher HTTPS adoption rates and is generally more privacy-aware.
- **Methodology**: Data is self-reported and qualitative, and further investigations are needed to determine large-scale effects.

### Conclusion and Future Work

This study provides the first qualitative analysis of user mental models of HTTPS, revealing misconceptions and differences between end users and administrators. Future work should focus on improving educational and UX approaches to enhance understanding and trust in HTTPS and other cryptographic protocols.
