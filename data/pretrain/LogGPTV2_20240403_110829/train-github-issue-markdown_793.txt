This program is currently accepted:
    use A::B;
    mod A {
        pub struct B { n: int }
        fn B() { }
    }
    fn main() {
    }
but this program, which adds a use of `B()`, is not:
    use A::B;
    mod A {
        pub struct B { n: int }
        fn B() { }
    }
    fn main() {
        let _ = B();
    }
