### Source code
**Config file**
    // playwright.config.js
    const { defineConfig } = require('@playwright/test');
    module.exports = defineConfig({
        preserveOutput: 'failures-only',
        snapshotPathTemplate: '{testDir}/__snapshots__/{testFilePath}/{arg}{ext}',
        testDir: './assets',
        use: {
            viewport: {
                width: 1440,
                height: 900,
            },
        },
    });
**Test file (self-contained)**
Simple tests like:
    test('builds CSS correctly', () => {
        expect(fs.readFileSync(`${PUBLIC_PATH}${MANIFEST['build/app/app.css']}`, 'utf-8')).toMatchSnapshot();
    });
    test('renders homepage correctly', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('');
        await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot({ fullPage: true });
    });
    // Etc...
**Steps**
  * Run `npx playwright test` (executed by `yarn test`)
**Expected**
To start running tests by executing `npx playwright test`, like it did in
previous versions (`1.34.0` and down).
**Actual**
Getting the following message:
    âžœ yarn test
    Please install @playwright/test package to use Playwright Test.
      npm install -D @playwright/test
**Already rules out a few things**
  1. Reinstalling `@playwright/test`
  2. Completely removing `node_modules` and reinstalling with `yarn`
  3. Works with `yarn add @playwright/test@1.34.0 -D`
  4. Package `playwright` is not installed
