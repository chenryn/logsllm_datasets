leverage anycast) [5]. This helps performance by connecting DNS
clients to a close replica. Further, using anycast increases the global
robustness of the system by effectively breaking the network into
regions that operate independently. Therefore, when issues arise—
e.g., a replica becomes unreachable—the impact is to a topologically
localized region rather than felt globally. As we sketch above, in
our analysis we label authoritative nameservers by their IP ad-
dresses. Without taking into account whether anycast is in use we
may underestimate the amount of global robustness present in the
system. However, our robustness findings are at least germane to
regions of the Internet. Consider the Dyn attack we sketch in § 1
[2]. Dyn’s use of anycast in their infrastructure meant that instead
of the attack being uniformly felt throughout the network it was
more pronounced in certain regions than in others. This illustrates
that while anycast is a beneficial technique for increasing global
robustness, it does not cure all issues. Our future work includes
taking anycast into consideration in our analysis.
4 ZONE ROBUSTNESS
First, we tackle the robustness of each SLD individually.
4.1 Nameserver Replicas
As we sketch in § 1, RFC 1034 requires each DNS zone to maintain
two nameservers for robustness [8], while RFC 2182 requires these
nameservers to be geographically and topologically diverse [4]. In
other words, we should eschew single points of failure—whether
that be a single host or a single network. We use the WZFs to study
the extent to which these robustness requirements are followed in
the wild. Figure 3 shows the percentage of the fully resolved SLDs

are missing .net snapshots for three months during our collection
period and do not consider those months in our analysis.3 The red
line in Figure 2 shows the growth rate of the number of SLDs in the
three zones across our dataset relative to April 2009. The number of
SLDs is generally increasing over time, as expected. The number of
SLDs in the three TLDs increases from about 100M in April, 2009 to
roughly 157M in April, 2018. While not shown on the figure, we find
a corresponding increase in the number of NS records contained
in the zone files—which makes sense since each SLD must have
NS records. The blue line on the figure shows the growth in the
number of A records in the three TLDs across time—again, relative
to April 2009. The number of A records grows from 2.1M in April,
2009 to a high of roughly 3.1M in September, 2013. The number
is then fairly stable until early 2016 at which point we observe a
downward trend until the end of our dataset. This simple count
cannot conclusively show anything because the count only covers
three TLDs, but the plot does give us our first objective inkling that
the DNS ecosystem is using fewer nameservers for more SLDs and
therefore is becoming more concentrated.
Dataset T : Traceroutes: From a host at ICSI in Berkeley, CA in
April, 2018 we ran traceroute to every /24 we find in the April, 2018
zone files via step 2. Additionally, for /24s that we find to be highly
utilized (as we discuss in § 5), we run traceroutes from a handful of
looking glass servers located on each continent of the globe.
3.2 Methodology
Our analysis methodology is as follows.
Step 1: Mining NS Records: As we discuss above, we use one
snapshot of the zone files for each month. Our first step is to gather
the NS records from Z for all sites in the corresponding list in A.
Step 2: Mining A Records: Next, we “resolve” the NS hostnames
we find in step 1 to IP addresses using the A records in the given
zone file snapshot in Z. Since we only use three zone files, we
are missing some A records that correspond to NS records in our
zones (e.g., an NS record may point to ns1.example.info and since
we do not have the .info zone file we are unable to determine the
corresponding IP address).4 Therefore, below we frame analyses in
3The three months of missing .net zone files and the three months of missing Alexa
lists do not overlap.
4Note, we could simply issue a DNS lookup to get the current IP addresses, but since
our analysis spans the last nine years, this approach will not work.

is in compliance with the topological diversity requirement without
continuous auditing. However, we recommend that TLDs enforce a
requirement that SLDs have nameservers in at least two distinct
/24 address blocks. While this is not a guarantee of topological
diversity, it is an easy step that has little downside.

that meet (blue line), do not meet (red line) and exceed (black line)
the minimum zone-level robustness requirements over time. For
this analysis we use the crude notion that nameservers in different
/24 blocks are topologically diverse, as we discuss in § 3.2. Therefore,
the percentage of SLDs that do not meet the minimum requirements
is a lower bound in that these SLDs cannot meet the requirements
since all their nameservers fall within the same /24 address block.
The percentage of SLDs that meet and exceed the requirements are
upper bounds. I.e., while the nameservers span /24 address blocks,
those blocks may in fact be routed to the same place. Finally, note
the percentages for a given month do not sum to 100% because
we elide partially resolved and unresolved SLDs, which together
constitute 12–15% of the SLDs over time.
The plot shows the DNS ecosystem becoming more robust over
time. The percentage of SLDs that do not meet the basic—and
lenient in our /24-based analysis—requirements is decreasing over
time. Meanwhile, the percentage of SLDs that meet or exceed the
requirements is increasing. A more precise accounting requires
historical routing data and is beyond the scope of this initial paper.
However, the single points on the plot—color coded to match the
lines—represent a refinement of our analysis for the last month of
our dataset based on the traceoute data we describe in § 3. The single
points show an analysis that is based on using the last hop router to
determine network diversity.5 The percentage of SLDs that exceed
the requirements is only overestimated by about 2% using the crude
/24-based analysis. This gives us confidence that the upward trend
of SLDs increasing their diversity is in fact likely correct. However,
the other two points show a 15% decrease in percentage of SLDs
that exactly meet the requirements and an increase of 17% of SLDs
that do not meet the requirements. This shows that while the red
line provides a solid bound, the downward trend of SLDs failing to
meet the minimum requirements may be misleading.
Recommendation 1: Roughly 28% of the SLDs currently do not
meet the minimum requirements for the number and diversity of au-
thoritative nameservers. The owners of these SLDs—or their chosen
providers—should take steps to remedy this precarious situation.
Recommendation 2: Because routing is a dynamic process, it is
generally difficult for a TLD operator to understand whether an SLD
5Note, traceroute cannot always find the last hop router and we fall back to the /24-
based analysis when this occurs.
4.2 Glue Location
We next turn to the process of resolving NS records to IP addresses.
Resolving www.example.com involves a query to the .com TLD
nameserver. The answer from the .com nameserver is a series of
NS records (e.g., for ns1.example.com). These records must then be
resolved into IP addresses before being useful. In this case, the .com
TLD will have corresponding A records since the NS record falls
within .com. The NS and A records—the so-called “glue”—will be
served in the same DNS response. For instance, a response contain-
ing an NS record pointing to ns1.example.com will also contain an
A record that maps ns1.example.com to 1.2.3.4.
Consider an NS record pointing to a different TLD—e.g., an NS
record for example.com pointing to ns1.dns-provider.net. In this case,
the response from the .com TLD will not include an A record. Rather,
the requester must go through the process of querying for the A
record of ns1.dns-provider.net. Compared to the case where the NS
and A records and are in the same TLD, this process incurs both (i)
additional lookup delay and (ii) additional failure modes. That is,
now looking up a name within example.com can fail when the .net
and dns-provider.net networks have issues, whereas in-zone glue
has no such failure cases.
We find that 69–73% of the popular SLDs have at least one in-
zone NS record across the span of our dataset. When no in-zone
glue is available, the most robust approach is to use nameservers in
multiple TLDs such that there is no single point of failure. Across
our dataset we find at most 0.2% of the popular SLDs leverage
multiple outside TLDs to provide the addresses for NS records.
The remaining 27–31% of the SLDs (over time) rely on a single
out-of-zone TLD to resolve NS records.
Recommendation 3: Even though TLD servers are robust—as we
discuss in § 1—the cost of avoiding reliance on a second TLD in the
lookup process is small. Mitigating this issue for the 27–31% of SLDs
without in-zone glue does not require added resources, but simply
adding in-zone glue to aid resolution of NS records. Therefore, we
recommend all SLDs have at least some in-zone glue.
Recommendation 4: If no in-zone glue is available, we recom-
mend SLDs use nameservers from multiple TLDs to avoid a single
point of failure. As with the previous recommendation, the cost of
this is only additional entries in zone files.
5 SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE
We now turn our attention from individual SLDs to building an
understanding of how the inter-dependence between SLDs impacts
robustness. As concrete motivation we note that over our nine year
dataset 91–93% of the SLDs share at least one nameserver (by IP)
with at least one other SLD. In the era of out-sourced DNS hosting,
content-distribution networks and centralized cloud computing
infrastructure this level of sharing is unsurprising. Our aim is to
better understand the scope of shared DNS infrastructure.
