User: I am editing a python script that I wrote a while ago, using aquamacs on Mac lion.
Whichever letter or number I type is being interpreted as "enter" (that is, I hit "g" for example, my text is dissrupted and a newline appears, but "g" does not appear). Restarting aquamacs, the terminal out of which I run it, or the whole computer did not help.
Other observations (that might or might not be connected):
- The script is located in a folder under Dropbox 
- The file has special attributes (that is an "@" appears at the end of the permissions, upon typing ls -lah)
- I might have hit a combination of Control, Apple and other keys that I should not have ....
Any solution to this would be very much appreciated (and my apologies, if that has been treated before).
Thanks!
Assistant: I also met with this problem recently. 
You need to add minor mode Fill. Press on the Python in the mode line in mouse-3 way and choose Auto Fill.
