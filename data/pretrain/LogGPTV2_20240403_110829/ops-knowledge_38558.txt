Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

I am currently editing a Python script that I wrote some time ago, using Aquamacs on macOS Lion. Whenever I type a letter or number, it is interpreted as an "Enter" key press. For example, if I type "g," the text is disrupted, and a new line appears, but the "g" does not appear. I have tried restarting Aquamacs, the terminal from which I run it, and even the entire computer, but the issue persists.

Additional observations (which may or may not be related to the problem):
- The script is located in a folder within my Dropbox.
- The file has special attributes, as indicated by an "@" symbol at the end of the permissions when I run `ls -lah`.
- I might have accidentally pressed a combination of Control, Command, and other keys that I should not have.

Any solution to this issue would be greatly appreciated. If this problem has already been addressed elsewhere, I apologize for the repetition.

Thank you!

I recently encountered a similar problem. To resolve it, you need to enable the Auto Fill minor mode. You can do this by right-clicking (or using the middle mouse button) on the "Python" label in the mode line and selecting "Auto Fill" from the context menu. This should help with the unintended line breaks and allow you to type letters and numbers normally.

If this does not solve the issue, please provide more details, and we can explore further solutions.
