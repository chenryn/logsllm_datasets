#### 5.11 Filtering Web Content
Protecting users and organizations from unwanted web content is generally not a privacy issue, as the information is typically not targeted at individuals. However, some web applications use user-specific data (e.g., domain name, IP address) to personalize content, which may necessitate filtering or blocking specific content. Section 5.14 discusses web content that creates or uses persistent information on the user's computer. Filtering web content primarily addresses the secondary effects of privacy loss.

#### 5.12 Blocking Pop-Up Windows
A distinct category of unwanted web content is known as pop-up windows. These are unprompted displays (often advertisements) that appear on the user's browser screen. While blocking these can be useful, this feature is not directly related to privacy.

#### 5.13 Spyware Detection and Removal
Spyware refers to software that is surreptitiously installed on a user's computer and reports information about the user’s activities back to the originator. This software often employs common virus techniques for propagation and installation. It can gather and report any information about an individual, including data from banking and commercial sites. Technologies for detecting and removing spyware support all main aspects of privacy: unobservability, unlinkability, and anonymity.

#### 5.14 Browser Cleaning Tools
A typical Internet browser stores significant amounts of information about its usage on the computer where it is installed. This includes visited site addresses and copies of retrieved information. Additionally, websites can store small files (cookies) on the user's computer to facilitate future logins, remember session states, or track updates. The stored information reflects the user’s browsing history and may contain sensitive and private data. Utilities designed to clean the browser of this history and cookies support all main aspects of privacy: unobservability, unlinkability, and anonymity.

#### 5.15 Activity Traces Eraser
Outside of the Internet browser, most computers store information about their usage, typically in log files recorded by the operating system and applications. This stored information reflects the user’s actions and may contain both sensitive and private data. Utilities that delete this history can support all main aspects of privacy: unobservability, unlinkability, and anonymity.

#### 5.16 Hard Disk Data Eraser
When replacing a hard disk or sending a computer for repair, any sensitive data on the disk is at risk, even if the rest of the computer is inoperable. Deleted data can still be recovered by a technician using appropriate tools. In such situations, it is essential to ensure that the data on the disk cannot be read. Special procedures and utilities are required for effective data deletion. Utilities for erasing hard disks effectively can be considered privacy-enhancing features, supporting unobservability, unlinkability, and anonymity.

#### 5.17 Privacy Policy Generators
Tools for creating privacy policies are not considered active Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), but they are often included in PET frameworks. These tools facilitate the creation and management of privacy policies and principles. While they provide informational support, they do not directly enhance privacy.

#### 5.18 Privacy Policy Readers/Validators
Corresponding to the tools mentioned in 5.17, some utilities allow users to examine a website’s privacy policy to determine if the site complies with the user’s privacy requirements. These readers/validators are not active PETs but assist users in making privacy decisions. They are considered informational tools and do not directly support privacy aspects.

#### 5.19 Privacy Compliance Scanning
To verify that websites comply with their declared privacy policies, automated tools can scan the sites and compare the found information to the stated rules. This scanning can be conducted using standalone tools or by commissioning a service provider. Compliance scanning is an informational feature and does not directly support privacy aspects.

#### 5.20 Identity Management
Reliably identifying users of electronic services is crucial for providing rich functionality and ensuring security. The primary goal of identity management systems is to simplify user administration while protecting individual privacy by allowing users to control their own profiles. Tools and utilities that support identity management often form part of a privacy-enhancing framework. Once defined, the user's identity can be verified using various techniques without recording the identity itself, thus supporting the anonymity aspect of privacy.

#### 5.21 Biometrics
As mentioned in section 5.20, user identity can be verified in many ways, including biometric data. Identification can be performed without recording the biometric data itself by comparing an encrypted version against a reference register. When used appropriately, biometrics can support the unlinkability aspect of privacy by confirming a person's identity without linking it to their private data.

#### 5.22 Smart Cards
Smart cards can be used for identification similarly to biometrics, incorporating encryption either in the card or the reader. However, it is important to note that the procedure identifies the card, not the bearer. Since the card does not need to hold information to identify the bearer, smart cards can support the anonymity aspect of privacy.

#### 5.23 Permission Management
Permission management is closely related to identity management because reliable user identification is often required to associate the correct credentials. However, granting permissions often depends on the situation and the user's role rather than their identity. In such cases, managing permissions can be performed without storing profiles with identities, thus supporting the anonymity aspect of privacy.

#### 5.24 Monitoring and Audit Tools
Administrative tools for monitoring and auditing security are well-known elements in today’s computing environment. Privacy monitoring and audit tools have considerable functional overlap with other security functions, as privacy management is an integral part of enterprise security management. These tools can support the unobservability aspect of privacy.

#### 5.25 Forensics Tools
Tools for investigating security or privacy breaches often involve ad hoc methods to retrieve information not normally recorded. Forensic tools are not considered operational in the management of privacy.

#### 6 Use Cases
Every day, we encounter situations where privacy concerns have been important design criteria for information handling, whether using electronic media or manual processes. A classic example is the voting process: the voter must be identified and checked against the electoral register, then cast their vote anonymously. If the correct procedure is followed, no vote can be linked to a person, and each registered voter can only cast one vote. Similarly, many business and administrative procedures are designed to preserve privacy, and some are supported by privacy-enhancing technologies. The following examples illustrate typical privacy-related use cases:

#### 6.1 Anonymous Business Relations
Many traditional businesses act as intermediaries between two parties, such as real estate agents and recruiting agents. The agent’s role is to bring the parties together and receive fees from at least one party. Thus, it is in the agent’s interest to control the information shared between the parties until a match is found. Traditionally, this was achieved through separate communication and trust in the agent. In the digital age, IT systems must support the same functionality of separating party information from their identities, and users must trust the technology as they did the agent. Anonymous business relations are typically supported by the built-in functionality of the agent’s systems. Users should check the agent’s privacy policy and seek confirmation of compliance (see sections 5.17, 5.18, and 5.19). If the user does not trust the agent or the site, they can use user-controlled tools to ensure anonymity (see sections 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5).

#### 6.2 Commerce Chain Management
In traditional business chains connecting producers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers, there is increasing value in being closer to the consumer and collecting information about their interests. For example, in the travel industry, travel agencies share some end-user data with hotel chains and airlines for logistics but want to retain valuable information about customer preferences and travel patterns. This is reflected in the design of IT systems, which use privacy-related technologies driven by commercial needs. The purpose is to establish and protect the business model of professional players and offer personalized services. Consumers often need to provide relevant data to the agency/shop for personalized service, but they might want to limit the use of this information to the specific instance of service agreed upon with the provider. In such cases, privacy-enhancing technologies can be used to communicate and check the privacy policy of the shop/agent (see sections 5.17-5.19) or to identify the user by means other than their private information (see sections 5.1, 5.20, and 5.22).

#### 6.3 Privacy Requirements in Public Service
In recent years, the increasing use of interconnected IT systems to serve consumer needs has raised concerns about the spread of sensitive private data, such as health, political, and religious information. Both EU directives and national legislation support privacy requirements, and many private and public institutions are implementing compliant policies, functionality, and procedures. For example, Danish law requires public library lending records to be deleted after four weeks to prevent possible "profiling" of users’ reading habits. Another example is digital rights management, where IT systems must document the use of software and other copyrighted material without disclosing the user's identity. Privacy protection in such cases is often implemented in new IT systems or as add-on products to existing systems. However, the responsibility for privacy protection remains with the service provider, and users must trust that the service complies with legislation.

#### 6.4 Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) Technology
In some situations, when a product's identity can be linked to a person, the product ID can pose a privacy threat because the product can be traced. An example is the use of Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), which allow remote identification of a small computer chip embedded in or attached to products. A typical usage scenario is attaching RFID tags to goods sold in supermarkets for identification and accounting at the exit gate. To protect the buyer's privacy, the RFID can be disabled before exiting the store. However, producers may want to follow their goods further, such as during the warranty period. To accommodate this without compromising privacy, the RFID must be disabled at the store exit but re-enabled by the user if warranty service is needed.

The scope of RFID is not limited to products. It is often used to identify pet animals and, in some recent cases, has been inserted under the skin of humans who volunteer for this type of identification. Examples include members of a beach club (for access control) and high-risk patients in hospitals (for reliable identification in emergencies). In these cases, RFID is used as an alternative identity token, not as a privacy-enhancing technology.

#### 6.5 Financial Transactions
In many countries, protecting the privacy of the customer is essential in personal banking and other financial services. Citizens' freedom to conduct private transactions is highly valued. However, the development of eGovernment services and the fight against organized crime have increased the general acceptance of public surveillance of individual financial transactions. For example, Danish legal requirements mandate that employers, authorities, and financial institutions submit details of citizens' personal finances directly to tax authorities, making it nearly impossible for a private person to conduct substantial financial transactions without leaving a trace. The public generally accepts this, based on a high level of trust in authorities. However, individuals can use multiple banks and financial services in parallel without informing any of them of the other engagements.

#### 6.6 Anonymous Shopping
In many shopping situations, consumers prefer not to be identified and associated with their purchases. This includes illegal drugs and stolen goods, but also a wide range of legal goods and services, such as prescription drugs, books on sensitive subjects, private services, and personal loans. Such transactions can be conducted in person using physical money or electronic cash (coin cards) as payment. SSL encryption of Internet transactions (see section 5.8) is often used to transmit credit card information, primarily to guard against fraud. However, encryption also protects the information in transit from being read by third parties.

Alternatively, goods can be purchased over the Internet using privacy solutions from trusted third parties (see section 5.5) to anonymize the payment and deliver the physical goods to a pick-up address. This allows shops to do business with customers without knowing their identities.
