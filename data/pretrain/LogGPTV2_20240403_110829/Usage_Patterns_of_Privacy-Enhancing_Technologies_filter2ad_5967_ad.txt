5.11  FILTERING WEB CONTENT 
Protecting users and organizations against unwanted web content is generally not a privacy 
issue, since the information is normally not targeted against individuals. However, some web 
applications  are  using  knowledge  about  the  user  (e.g.  domain  name,  IP  address)  to 
personalize the content, so the user can experience the need for filtering or blocking specific 
content.  Web  content,  creating  or  using  persistent  information  on  the  user’s  computer,  is 
described in Section 5.14. Filtering web content is only addressing the secondary effects of 
loss of privacy. 
5.12  BLOCKING POP-UP WINDOWS 
A  separate  class  of  unwanted  web  content  is  known  as  Pop-up  windows:  Using  different 
methods, the web site presents unprompted content (most often advertisements) on the user’s 
browser screen. Blocking this inconvenient disturbance can be useful, but this feature is not 
related to privacy. 
5.13  SPYWARE DETECTION AND REMOVAL 
Spyware is a commonly used term for software that is hidden on the user’s computer, and 
reports information about the user’s information and his actions back to the originator of the 
spyware.  This  kind  of  software  is  most  often  using  well  known  virus  techniques  for 
propagation  and  installation  on  the  user’s  computer,  and  is  capable  of  reporting  any 
information about an individual, that can be retrieved from his computer or via its access to 
other  computers,  such  as  banking  or  commercial  sites.  Technologies  for  detection  and 
removal  of  spyware  can  be  supporting  all  main  aspects  of  privacy:  Unobservability, 
unlinkability and anonymity. 
5.14  BROWSER CLEANING TOOLS 
A normally configured Internet browser will store significant amounts of information about 
its use on the computer, where it is installed. The information includes (but is not limited to) 
addresses  of  visited  sites  and  copies  of  the  retrieved  information.  In  addition  to  this,  the 
browser can let the web sites store any information as small files (cookies) on the computer, 
where  they  can  be  collected  at  a  later  date,  e.g.  to  relieve  the  user  from  the  burden  of  a 
repeated login, to remember where the user left during the previous session or to recognize 
updates since last visit. The stored information will reflect the history of the user’s actions, 
and  may  contain  both  sensitive  and  private  information.  Utilities  offered  for  cleaning  the 
browser for this history track and the stored cookies can be supporting all main aspects of 
privacy: Unobservability, unlinkability and anonymity. 
5.15  ACTIVITY TRACES ERASOR 
Also  outside  the  Internet  browser,  most  computers  will  store  information  about  their  use, 
typically  as  log  files  recorded  by  the  operation  system  and  the  applications.  The  stored 
information will reflect the history of the user’s actions, and may contain both sensitive and 
private information. Utilities offered for deleting this history track can be supporting all main 
aspects of privacy: Unobservability, unlinkability and anonymity.

5.16  HARD DISK DATA ERASOR 
When replacing a hard disk of a computer or when leaving it in for repair, any sensitive data 
on the disk is at risk, even if the rest of the computer is inoperational. Even when deleted by 
the computer user, such data is clearly visible to a technician, using the appropriate tools. In 
these situations – and many other similar cases - it is wise to assure that the data on the disk 
no longer can be read. A special procedure – and special utilities -  is required for the user to 
delete  the  data  effectively.  Utilities  offered  for  erasing  hard  disks  effectively  can  be 
considered  a  privacy  enhancing  feature,  supporting  all  3  main  aspects:  Unobservability, 
unlinkability and anonymity. 
5.17  PRIVACY POLICY GENERATORS 
Tools  for  creating  privacy  policies  are  not  considered  active  Privacy  Enhancing 
Technologies, but they are often presented as components of a PET framework: A number of 
tools  are  offered  to  facilitate  creation  and  management  of  privacy  policies  and  principles, 
such  features  are  considered  informational  tools,  not  directly  supporting  the  aspects  of 
privacy. 
5.18  PRIVACY POLICY READERS/VALIDATORS 
Corresponding to the tools mentioned under 5.17 , some utilities exist for users to examine a 
web site’s privacy policy, to determine if the web site /organization is complying with the 
user’s  privacy  requirements.  Such  readers/validators  are  not  considered  active  Privacy 
Enhancing Technologies, but they do assist the user in taking privacy decisions. The policy 
readers are considered informational tools, not directly supporting the aspects of privacy. 
5.19  PRIVACY COMPLIANCE SCANNING 
To verify that web sites comply with the declared privacy policy for the owner organization, 
the  sites  can  be  scanned  and  the  service  offered  can  be  tested  using  automated  tools  that 
compare  the  information  found  to  the  rules  set  out  in  the  policy.  Such  a  scanning  can  be 
conducted  using  standalone  tools,  or  by  commissioning  the  task  to  a  service  provider. 
Compliance  scanning  is  an  informational  feature,  not  directly  supporting  the  aspects  of 
privacy. 
5.20  IDENTITY MANAGEMENT 
Reliably  identifying  users  of  electronic  services  is  a  prerequisite  for  providing  rich 
functionality  –  and  supporting  the  relevant  security  aspects.  The  main  purpose  of  Identity 
management systems is to simplify user administration, while still protecting the privacy of 
the  individual  by  leaving  him  in  control  of  his  own  profile.  Hence,  tools  and  utilities  that 
support  identity  management  often  form  part  of  a  privacy-enhancing  framework.  Once 
defined,  the  user  identity  can  be  verified  using  various  techniques,  without  recording  the 
identity itself. In this way, Identity management can support the anonymity aspect of privacy.

5.21  BIOMETRICS 
As mentioned in section 5.20, the user identity can be verified in many ways, one of which 
can  be  using  biometric  data.  The  identification  can  be  performed  without  recording  the 
biometric  data  itself,  by  comparing  an  encrypted  version  of  the  data  against  a  reference 
register.  Used  this  way,  biometrics  constitute  a  one-way  mechanism  to  confirm  a  persons 
identity, without linking it to his private data. Hence, when used appropriately, biometrics 
can support the unlinkability aspect of privacy. 
5.22  SMART CARDS 
Smart  cards  can  be  used  for  identification  in  a  similar  way  to  biometrics,  by  including 
encryption,  either  in  the  card  or  in  the  reader.  However,  it  must  be  remembered,  that  the 
procedure  can  only  identify  the  card,  not  the  bearer.  Since  the  card  need  not  to  hold 
information to identify the bearer, smart cards can support the anonymity aspect of privacy. 
5.23  PERMISSION MANAGEMENT 
This feature is closely connected to identity management, because a reliable identification of 
the user is often required to associate him with the correct credentials. However, granting a 
permission is often depending on the situation, combined with the role of the user, rather than 
his  identity.  In  such  cases,  managing  permissions  can  be  performed  without  storing  the 
profiles together with the identities, and permission management can support the anonymity 
aspect of privacy. 
5.24  MONITORING AND AUDIT TOOLS 
Administrative  tools  to  monitor  and  audit  security  are  well  known  elements  of  today’s 
computing  environment.  The  tools  for  monitoring  privacy  have  a  considerable  functional 
overlap with other security functions, i.e. the management of privacy is an integral part of the 
enterprise  security  management.  The  privacy  monitoring  and  audit  tools  can  be  used  to 
support the unobservability aspect of privacy. 
5.25  FORENSICS TOOLS 
Tools  to  investigate  security  (or  privacy)  breaches  are  often  ad  hoc  methods  to  retrieve 
information not normally recorded. The forensics tools are not considered operational in the 
management of privacy.

6  USE CASES 
Every  day,  we  encounter  situations  where  privacy  concerns  have  been  important  design 
criteria  for  the  information  handling  procedures,  independently  of  whether  we  are  using 
electronic media or handling the information manually. A classical example is the procedure 
of  voting:  First,  the  voting  person  must  be  identified  and  checked  against  the  electoral 
register, then, the vote is cast anonymously in the polling both. If the correct voting procedure 
is followed, no vote can be linked to a person, while each registered voter can cast his vote 
only  once.  Similarly,  a  number  of  business  and  administrative  procedures  are  designed  to 
preserve  privacy;  some  of  these  procedures  are  supported  with  privacy  enhancing 
technologies. The following examples illustrate some typical privacy related use cases: 
6.1  ANONYMOUS BUSINESS RELATIONS 
A  number  of  traditional  businesses  are  built  on  the  principle  of  being  the  “middle  man” 
between  two  parties.  Examples  of  such  are  real  estate  agents  and  recruiting  agents:  The 
agent’s business is to bring two parties together, and receiving fees from (at least) one of the 
parties. Hence, it is in the interest of the agent to control the parties’ information about each 
other, until a match is found. Traditionally, this control was achieved by the agent’s separate 
communication with the parties, and the parties’ trust in the agent. In the new age, where part 
(or all) of such a business process is carried out by IT systems, these systems must be able to 
support  the  same  functionality  of  separating  the  information  about  the  parties  from  their 
identity, and the parties must have the same trust in the technology, as they had before in the 
agent. The anonymous business relations are typically supported by the built-in functionality 
of  the  agent’s  systems,  which  makes  it  relevant  for  the  users  of  the  service  to  check  the 
agent’s  privacy  policy  and  to  seek  confirmation  of  the  compliance  of  the  agent’s  site  (see 
sections 5.17, 5.18 and 5.19). If the user doesn’t trust the agent or the site he is using, it could 
be relevant to apply user controlled tools to ensure anonymity, as described in sections 5.3, 
5.4 and 5.5. 
6.2  COMMERCE CHAIN MANAGEMENT 
In  cases,  where  traditional  business  chains  exist,  connecting  producer,  wholesaler,  retailer 
and consumer, it has an increasing business value to be closer to the consumer, and collect 
information about his interest in the products and services offered. This is seen e.g. in the 
travel industry, where travel agencies for purposes of logistics need to share some data about 
the  end  user  with  hotel  chains  and  airline  carriers,  but  certainly  want  to  retain  valuable 
information  about  the  customer’s  preferences  and  travel  patterns.  Such  requirements  are 
reflected in the design of the IT systems used by the business: They are using privacy-related 
technologies, but the drivers are mostly commercial. The purpose is to establish and protect 
the business model of the professional players, and to offer the client a personalized service. 
In  most  cases,  the  consumer  has  to  provide  relevant  data  to  the  agency/shop,  if  he  or  she 
appreciates a personal service, but the user might want to limit the use of the information to 
the  specific  instance  of  service,  agreed  with  the  provider.  In  this  case,  the  use  of  privacy 
enhancing  technologies  could  be  appropriate,  e.g.  to  communicate  and  check  the  privacy 
policy of the shop/agent (se section 5.17-5.19 ), or to identify the user by other means than 
his private information (se section 5.1, 5.20 and 5.22 )

6.3  PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS IN PUBLIC SERVICE 
In the recent years, the increasing use of interconnected IT systems to serve the needs of the 
consumer has led to growing concern about the spreading of sensitive private data, such as 
health data, information of political and religious attitude. Both EU directives and national 
legislation support the requirement of privacy, and a growing number of private and public 
institutions are implementing compliant policies, functionality and procedures. One example 
of such an implementation is the public library lending records, which according to Danish 
law must be deleted after 4 weeks upon book return, to prevent possible "profiling" of the 
users’ reading. Another example is digital rights management: The IT system must document 
the use of software  and other copyright protected material (so the copyright holder can be 
paid) without disclosing the identity of the user. The privacy protection in such cases is often 
implemented  in  new  IT  systems,  or  as  add-on  products  to  existing  systems.  However,  the 
responsibility of privacy protection remains with the service provider, and the user must trust 
that the service is compliant with the legislation. 
6.4  RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION DEVICES (RFID) 
technology 
In some situations, when the identity of a product can be linked to a person, the product id 
can be a threat to privacy, because the product can be traced. An example of this is the use of 
Radio  Frequency  Identification  Devices  (RFID),  a 
that  allows  remote 
identification of a small computer chip that can be embedded in or attached to products of 
any kind. The typical usage scenario is attaching the RFID to goods sold in a supermarket, so 
the goods can be identified and accounted for at the exit gate. In such a case it is simple to 
protect the privacy of the buyer by disabling (destroying) the RFID before the exit from the 
store. But the producers of many goods have an interest in following their goods further, e.g. 
in the warranty period. To accommodate this need without compromising privacy, the RFID 
must be disabled at the store exit, but re-enabled by the user, if the need for warranty service 
occurs. 
However,  the  scope  of  RFID  is  not  limited  to  products.  It  is  often  used  to  identify  pet 
animals,  and  in  some  recent  cases,  RFID  chips  have  even  been  inserted  under  the  skin  of 
humans, volunteering to use this kind of identification. Examples of this application are the 
members  of  a  beach  club  (for  convenient  access  control)  and  some  high-risk  patients  in 
hospitals  (for  reliable  identification  in  emergency  situations).  However,  in  such  cases,  the 
RFID is merely used as an alternative identity token, not a privacy enhancing technology. 
6.5  FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS 
In  many  countries,  protecting  the  privacy  of  the  customer  is  an  essential  part  of  personal 
banking and other financial services, and the citizen’s freedom to conduct private deals and 
transactions  with  other  parties  is  highly  appreciated.  However,  the  development  of 
eGovernment services,  combined with the  fight  against organized crime, has increased the 
general  acceptance  of  public  surveillance  of  the  individual’s  financial  transactions.  As  an 
example, the Danish legal requirements for employers, authorities and financial institutions to 
submit details of the citizen’s personal economy directly to the tax authorities makes it almost 
impossible  for  a  private  person  to  conduct  any  substantial  financial  transaction  without 
leaving  tracks  of  information.  The  public  has  generally  accepted  this  situation,  assumedly 
based on a high level of trust to the authorities. However, it is possible for individuals to use

several different banks and/or financial services in parallel, without informing any of them of 
the other engagements. 
6.6  ANONYMOUS SHOPPING 
In  many  shopping  situations,  the  consumer  prefers  not  to  be  identified  and  related  to  the 
purchase. Obviously, this includes illegal drugs, stolen goods etc, but also a wide range of 
legal  goods  and  services  are  sold  to  unidentified  buyers:  Examples  are  prescription  drugs, 
books on sensitive subjects, private services, personal loans. Such transactions can be carried 
out person to person, using physical money or electronic cash (coin card) as payment. SSL 
encryption  of  Internet  transactions  (see  section  5.8)  is  often  used  when  transmitting  credit 
card information, mainly to guard the parties against fraud. However, the encryption will also 
protect the information in-route from being read by third parties. 
Alternatively,  the  goods  can  be  purchased  over  the  Internet,  using  privacy  solutions  from 
trusted  third  parties  (see  section  5.5)  to  anonymize  the  payment,  and  deliver  the  physical 
goods  to  a  pick-up  address,  so  the  shop  can  do  business  with  customers  without  knowing
