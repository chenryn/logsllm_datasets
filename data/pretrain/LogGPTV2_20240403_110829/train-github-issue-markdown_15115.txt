Find -> Find File (cmd-P) does nothing if you haven't opened any files yet.
Not even an error message. Now that I've used Atom for a few minutes, I think
I see why that is, but I have to admit that I was about to write off Atom as
still too beta to use when the first button I pressed (well, besides cmd-
shift-P at welcome.md's insistence) fell flat and did nothing. Maybe the
button should be grayed out until it's ready.
I'm on OS X with Atom Version 0.111.0.
