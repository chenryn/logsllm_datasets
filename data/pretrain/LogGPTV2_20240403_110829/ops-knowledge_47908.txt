User: I've seen from some sources that although you can make an exe or mac equivalent app using py2exe or py2app, you can only make the one your system is. Makes sense when I think about it. 
But my problem is sometimes I want to write python scripts and send them to my Windows-using friends to test and play with. But Windows doesn't come with python installed, and I don't want to make them have to install Python. 
Is there any way to use a MAC to create a python-made file that can be opened without python or any installation ON WINDOWS?
If there's not I suppose I could try using the emulated Windows on my system to make it an exe, but I'd rather not boot that every time I need to change something.
Assistant: You can't make a native py2exe-style executable on Mac.  Use Virtualbox to run Windows inside your Mac environment.  No need to reboot the whole machine.
