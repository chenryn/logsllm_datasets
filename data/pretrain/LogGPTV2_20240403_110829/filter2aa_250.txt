## Overview
- **What is it?**
- **Exploiting it!**
- **Fixing it!**
- **Moving Forward**
- **Wrapping Up**

---

## Modern Day Networks
- **Vendor Dependent**: Limited flexibility and scalability.
- **Difficult to Scale**: Complex and prone to breaking.
- **Distributed and Inconsistent**: Configuration challenges.
- **Inflexible Protocols**: Unable to consider other factors.
- **Challenging to Modify**: Difficult to implement changes.

---

## Enter â€¦ Software Defined Networking (SDN)
- **Separation of Control and Data Plane**: 
  - **Control Plane**: Managed by a controller with full network visibility.
  - **Data Plane**: Switches and routers forward packets based on the controller's decisions.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Granular Policy Enforcement**
  - **Vendor Independence**: Supports any hardware or software.
  - **Cost-Effective**: Less expensive hardware.
  - **Enhanced BGP Security**: Faster convergence and better peering at IXPs.
  - **Real-World Applications**: Network slicing, load balancing, dynamic access control, and adaptive traffic monitoring.

---

## Emerging Standards
- **Old and Busted**:
  - SNMP
  - BGP
  - Netconf
  - LISP
  - PCEP
- **New Hotness**:
  - OVSDB
  - Openflow

---

## Introducing Openflow
- **Key Elements**:
  - **Controller**: Manages forwarding decisions.
  - **Secure Channel**: Communication between the controller and forwarding elements.
  - **Forwarding Element**: Executes packet forwarding.
- **Process**:
  - **Check Flow Table**: Matches incoming packets.
  - **Execute Action**: If a match is found, execute the action; otherwise, send the packet to the controller.
  - **Update Flow Table**: Controller updates the flow table as needed.
- **Flow Tables**:
  - **Match/Action Entries**: 12 fields available for matching, with wildcard options.
- **Leading Platforms**:
  - **Proprietary**:
    - Cisco APIC
    - Cisco XNC
    - HP VAN SDN Controller
    - IBM Programmable Network Controller
  - **Open-Source**:
    - Nox/Pox
    - Ryu
    - Floodlight
    - Opendaylight

---

## Floodlight and Opendaylight
- **Floodlight**:
  - Open-source Java controller.
  - Primarily supports Openflow v1.0.0.
  - Maintained by Big Switch Networks.
- **Opendaylight**:
  - Open-source Java controller.
  - Supports multiple southbound protocols, including Openflow v1.0.0 and v1.3.0.
  - A Linux Foundation collaborative project, supported by major vendors like Citrix, Red Hat, Ericsson, HP, Brocade, Cisco, Juniper, Microsoft, and IBM.

---

## Protocol Weaknesses
- **Encryption and Authentication**:
  - **TLS**: Recommended but not always required.
  - **TCP or TLS**: Some versions allow both, leading to potential security issues.
- **Vendor Implementation**:
  - **Controllers**:
    - **Floodlight**: No encryption or authentication.
    - **Opendaylight**: Encryption and authentication are supported but not mandatory.
  - **Switches**:
    - **Brocade, Cisco, Extreme**: Support encryption and authentication.
    - **Arista, Dell, HP, Huawei, IBM, Juniper, NEC, Netgear, OVS, Pronto**: Vary in support.

---

## Potential Exploits
- **Information Disclosure**: Through interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Centralization can lead to dependency and exploitation.
- **Controller Weaknesses**:
  - **Floodlight**: No encryption or authentication for northbound HTTP API.
  - **Opendaylight**: Default settings may be insecure, with weak passwords and default configurations.

---

## Tools for Identification and Exploitation
- **of-switch.py**: Impersonates an Openflow switch.
- **of-flood.py**: Floods an Openflow controller, disrupting the network.
- **dpctl**: Provides full control of the switch via command-line.
- **of-check.py**: Identifies Openflow services and their versions.
- **of-enum.py**: Enumerates Openflow endpoints and their types.
- **of-enum.nse**: Similar to of-enum.py, compatible with all Openflow versions.

---

## Demonstration
- **Scenario**: Small local area network with one admin host, two user hosts, one server, and one IDS.
- **Attacks**:
  - **Identify Targets**: Use of-map.py to download flows and identify targets.
  - **Gain Access to the Server**: Use of-access.py to modify flows and gain access.
  - **Isolate the Administrator**: Hide from the IDS and attack the server.

---

## Zero-Day Exploit
- **Opendaylight**:
  - **Southbound APIs**: No encryption or authentication for Netconf API.
  - **Java Vulnerabilities**: Potential for severe exploits due to running as root.
- **Default Configurations**: Weak passwords and lack of account lockout mechanisms.

---

## Available Solutions
- **For Now**:
  - **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
  - **Hardening**: VLAN, code review, and other security practices.
- **For the Future**:
  - **Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation**: SDN architecture and clustering.
  - **Network Partitioning**: Static flow entries and traffic counters.
  - **Verification**: Respond to abnormalities and ensure operational security.

---

## Prevalence and Future Trends
- **Gartner**: SDN is one of the top 10 critical IT trends for the next five years.
- **Market Adoption**: Major networking vendors have products or plans for SDN.
- **Surveys**: 60% of respondents expect SDN to be part of their network within five years.
- **Applications**: Data centers, clouds, LAN, and WAN.
- **Potential Benefits**:
  - **Vendor Independence and Cost Savings**
  - **Flexible and Dynamic Networks**
  - **Faster Evolution and Active Defenses**
- **Potential Risks**:
  - **Denial of Service (DoS)**
  - **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) Attacks**
  - **Shadow Operations and Darknets**
  - **Security Gaps in Controllers and Switches**
