User: Please introduce a virtualization technology to achieve better utilization of resources.
Assistant: Container virtualization technology is a virtualization technology that realizes better utilization of physical resources by virtualizing multiple isolated operating environments (containers) in user space. Container virtualization technology does not need to use a virtual machine monitor (VMM) to manage hardware resources, thereby avoiding the performance loss caused by virtualization. Container virtualization technology can be started and stopped quickly, making it ideal for high-density workload deployments. In addition, container virtualization technology also has flexible deployment, management, and upgrade capabilities, which can help enterprises quickly achieve the goals of elastic IT resources, high availability, and efficient utilization, and enhance the competitiveness of enterprises. Common container virtualization technologies include Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
