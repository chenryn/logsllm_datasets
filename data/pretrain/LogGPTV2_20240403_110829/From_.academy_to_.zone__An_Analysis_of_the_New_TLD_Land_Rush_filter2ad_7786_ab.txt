### Analysis of Domain Spending in the New TLD Program

Our analysis focuses on understanding why registrants invest in domains within the new Top-Level Domain (TLD) program. Some companies defensively register private TLDs, while others seek shorter domain names for their services. However, some of these companies have not yet established a presence in their new TLDs, making it challenging to differentiate between defensive and active registrations. Therefore, our primary interest lies in public TLDs, where we can more easily discern the intent behind individual domain registrations.

#### Differentiating Public and Private TLDs

To distinguish between public and private TLDs, we rely on publicly available information about the start of general availability, as provided by major domain registrars and nTLDStats [21], a well-regarded website that tracks data on the new TLD program. Registries typically list their TLDs for public registration, which allows registrars to prepare for selling domains in those TLDs. This classification method was validated through manual verification of 15 randomly sampled private domains. Using this approach, we identified 128 out of the 502 new TLDs as private.

#### Challenges with Scripting Requests

We considered automating our requests but found that the Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS) blocks obvious scripting attempts. Consequently, we did not pursue this method further.

#### Internationalized TLDs

We faced significant challenges in gathering substantial information about the new internationalized TLDs. These TLDs often require registration through international registrars and have unclear rules for sunrise and general availability periods, even with the help of native speakers. As a result, we excluded the 44 new internationalized TLDs from our analysis. We also focused on TLDs that reached general availability before our February 3, 2015 web crawl, ensuring our dataset includes all prospective domain owners.

After removing private and internationalized TLDs, we were left with 290 new public TLDs. These TLDs include generic words like "bike" and "academy," as well as geographical regions like "berlin" and "london." Additionally, four TLDs, such as "realtor," restrict registrations to members of specific communities. Our dataset contains multiple synonyms for common terms; for example, "picture" is represented by "photo" (12,933 domains), "photos" (17,500 domains), "pics" (6,506 domains), and "pictures" (4,633 domains).

### Methodology

#### Active Web Crawl

For each domain in the zone file of a new gTLD, we use a Firefox-based crawler to visit the webpage hosted on port 80. This crawler executes JavaScript, loads Flash, and renders the page as a user would see it. We capture the DOM, JavaScript transformations, page headers, response codes, and redirect chains.

#### Active DNS Query

During each web crawl, we perform a DNS query using a DNS crawler developed for [15]. We follow CNAME and NS records until we find an A or AAAA record or determine that no such record exists. We save all records along the chain to detect invalid NS records and annotate each web crawl with its CNAME chain.

#### Active WHOIS

Registry operators must provide accurate domain ownership data via the WHOIS protocol. ICANN encourages the use of WHOIS for lawful purposes, such as consumer, registrar, and law enforcement needs, while discouraging its use for spam. WHOIS server operators typically rate-limit requests and may format responses differently, causing parsing difficulties. We queried WHOIS for a small percentage of domains to understand ownership and intent.

#### Pricing Data

To analyze the economic impact of the new TLD program, we collected pricing data from various registrars. We automated data collection from the most common registrars and manually queried others. Some registrars required solving CAPTCHAs after a few requests. We estimated pricing per TLD by collecting data from the top five registrars for each TLD and converted prices to US dollars per year.

#### Alexa and Blacklists

We used the Alexa top million domains list to estimate user visits to new TLDs. We also compared new domain registrations with URIBL, a publicly available domain blacklist, to assess the rate of blacklisted domains in new versus old TLDs.

### Registration Volume

The introduction of new TLDs has had a minimal impact on the registration volume of old TLDs. While the new TLDs have increased the total number of registrations, they still see far fewer registrations than the dominant "com" TLD.

### Content Categories

To understand the intent behind each domain, we analyzed the content categories of the registered domains. This step provides insights into the types of websites and services being hosted on the new TLDs.

By following this structured approach, we aim to provide a comprehensive and clear understanding of the new TLD program and its impact on domain registration and usage.
