We have focused our analysis on why registrants spend money
on domains in the new TLD program. Some companies defensively
register private TLDs, while others simply want a shorter domain
name for their services. However, some companies in the latter
category have not established their presence in their new TLDs yet,
so we do not have a methodology to differentiate between these
cases. Thus, we are more interested in public TLDs, where we can
establish the registrant intent of individual domain names.
We differentiate public and private TLDs by checking public in-
formation about the start of general availability, as provided by sev-
eral large domain registrars and nTLDStats [21], a Web site that
tracks information on the new TLD program and is well-regarded
in the domain community. Registries include their TLDs in these
listings when they want public registrations, since the registrar col-
lects this list in anticipation of selling domains in the TLD. This
classiﬁcation technique held up to the 15 randomly sampled pri-
vate domains we veriﬁed manually. With this classiﬁcation, 128 of
the 502 new TLDs are private.
1We considered scripting our requests, but CZDS blocked obvious
scripting attempts, so we did not pursue this further.

Table 1: The number of new TLDs in each category on February
3, 2015, and their sizes. For the three TLDs for which we had
pending access requests, we used the size of the closest zone ﬁle.
Table 2: The ten largest TLDs in our public set with their general
availability dates.
In addition to the above, we found it difﬁcult to learn substan-
tial information about the new internationalized TLDs. In many
cases, registrants can only purchase domains for them from inter-
national registrars. They tend to have rules for sunrise and general
availability that we found unclear even with the help of a native
speaker. As a result, we also do not include these 44 new TLDs
in our analysis. Additionally, we focus on domains that reached
general availability (GA) before our February 3, 2015 Web crawl
so the set of registrants can include all prospective domain owners.
After removing private and internationalized TLDs from those
that had already began general availability, we end with a set of 290
new public TLDs. The total set of TLDs includes generic words
like bike and academy and geographical regions like berlin and
london, both represented in Table 1. Additionally, four TLDs gate
registrations to members of a particular community, such as the
realtor TLD for accredited realtors. To give a sense of how many
common word TLDs exist, our data set contains four synonyms
for “picture”: photo (12,933 domains), photos (17,500 domains),
pics (6,506 domains), and pictures (4,633 domains). Table 2
gives an overview of the largest TLDs in our set, with some of the
geographic TLDs featuring prominently. In the rest of this paper,
we restrict our analyses to these 290 TLDs.
3.4 Active Web
For each domain in the zone ﬁle of a new gTLD, we visit the
Web page hosted on port 80 of the domain with a crawler based
on Firefox, an improved version of the crawler used in our previ-
ous study of xxx [11]. Our browser-based Web crawler executes
JavaScript, loads Flash, and in general renders the page as close
as possible to what an actual user would see. We also follow redi-
rects of all kinds. After the browser loads all resources sent by the
remote server, we capture the DOM and any JavaScript transforma-
tions it has made. We also fetch page headers, the response code,
and the redirect chain.
Our primary data set for this paper is our Web crawl of all do-
mains in the new TLDs on February 3, 2015. We chose this date
due to its proximity to the timing of the latest ICANN reports,
which reﬂect the number of registered domains in each TLD as
of the end of January 2015.
3.5 Active DNS
Every time we Web crawl a domain, we also perform a DNS
query using a DNS crawler developed for [15]. We follow CNAME
and NS records and continue to query until we ﬁnd an A or AAAA
record, or determine that no such record exists. We save every
record we ﬁnd along the chain. We use DNS data to detect invalid
NS records and to annotate each Web crawl with its CNAME chain.
3.6 Active WHOIS
Registry operators for most TLDs must publicly provide accurate
domain ownership data using the WHOIS protocol. ICANN intends
the use of WHOIS for “any lawful purpose except to enable mar-
keting or spam, or to enable high volume, automated processes to
query a registrar or registry’s systems” [14]. In particular, ICANN
encourages its use by consumers, registrars, and law enforcement,
and discourages its use by spammers [29].
WHOIS server operators have leeway in how they achieve these
goals. They typically rate limit requests, and responses do not need
to conform to any standard format, which causes parsing difﬁculty
even once records are properly fetched. We only query WHOIS for
a small percentage of domains in the new gTLD program as an
investigative step towards understanding ownership and intent.
3.7 Pricing Data
One dimension of our analysis focuses on the economic im-
pact of the new TLD program, a task that requires domain pric-
ing information. Unfortunately for our data collection purposes,
registries do not sell domain names directly, but instead sell them
through ICANN-accredited registrars. A registry can sell their do-
main names through any registrars they choose, but each must get
similar wholesale prices and promotions [5].
We gathered pricing data for domains in the new gTLDs from
a wide range of registrars. First, we collected data from the most
common registrars for as many TLDs as possible. In some cases
the registrar included a pricing table with information for many
TLDs and we were able to automate the data collection process.
Other registrars only showed pricing information after querying a
domain name’s availability, which required many separate queries.
We made these queries manually. Some registrars made us solve a
single captcha after ﬁve to ten requests.
Obtaining pricing information for the most common registrars
simpliﬁes the process and allows us to obtain a large number of
(registrar, TLD) pairs in a short amount of time. However, we ulti-
mately want to estimate pricing per TLD, so we would like to have
registrar pricing data for many domain registrations in each TLD.
Some TLDs do not sell well or are not available at the most com-
mon registrars (e.g., geographical TLDs for non-Western regions).
We use the monthly registry reports to learn how many domains
each registrar manages in each TLD, and we collect pricing infor-
mation for the top ﬁve in each. Where possible, we also removed
registry-owned domains from our analysis, since they did not cost
anything. When registrars reported prices for non-standard time in-
tervals or in foreign currencies, we used the current exchange rate
to convert all prices to US dollars per year.

Week (mm/dd 2013-2014)
Figure 1: Number of new domains per day. Bars indicate the
average rate for each week.
Registries reserve a set of strings which they sell for increased
prices, known as premium domain names. For instance, GoDaddy
sells normal club domains for $10 USD, but universities.club
costs $5,000 USD, and this increase in price represents revenue
to both the registry and registrar. These domains number in the
thousands for any given TLD, and prices can vary per string. Our
methodology treats premium domains as normal domains, thus un-
derestimating registry and registrar revenue. Premium domain sales
do not always correlate with wholesale revenue, and we do not see
a scalable method to address this problem.
3.8 Alexa
We use the Alexa top million domains list to make an estimate of
how often users visit domains in the new TLDs [1]. Alexa collects
their data by allowing browser extensions to include their measure-
ment code in exchange for providing domain analytics, and by al-
lowing Web page operators to do the same. We use a domain’s
presence in the list as an indication that users visit it, but do not
place any emphasis on domain rankings.
3.9 Blacklists
We also compare new domain registrations with URIBL, a pub-
licly available domain blacklist, to see how the blacklist rate com-
pares between old and new TLDs [27]. We use their high-volume
rsync instance to download a new copy of the blacklist every hour.
Though they provide many types of blacklists, we only use the
standard and highest-volume blacklist, labeled “black”, as the rest
tend to be lower volume. This list represents the domains most
likely to be malicious, while the other lists include domains de-
tected through more experimental methodologies.
4. REGISTRATION VOLUME
We ﬁrst look at the impact of the new TLDs on overall registra-
tion volume. The new TLDs represent new opportunities for regis-
tering domains. As registrants create new domains, one possibility
is that they decide to create them in the new TLDs rather than the
old, thereby displacing registration activity in the old TLDs (e.g.,
because names taken in com are available in the new TLDs). An-
other possibility is that the new opportunities motivate even more
registrations, thereby growing total registration activity overall.
Figure 1 shows the number of new domain registrations per week
broken down into various categories. Days for which we did not
have access to the zone ﬁles resulted in slight drops in the graph.

Figure 2: Classiﬁcations for all domains in the new TLDs, a
random sample of the old TLDs, and a month of new domain
registrations in the old TLDs.
We show the most active old TLDs individually, the remaining old
TLDs grouped into “Old”, and the new TLDs in “New”.
Overall, the introduction of the new TLDs had only minimal im-
pact in the rate of registration of the old TLDs. The new TLDs
generally increase the total number of registrations rather than shift
focus from old to new TLDs. However, the new TLDs see far fewer
registrations than the old TLDs, largely because com continues to
dominate.
