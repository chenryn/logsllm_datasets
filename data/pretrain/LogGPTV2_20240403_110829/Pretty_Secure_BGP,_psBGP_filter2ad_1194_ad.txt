Proposition 3 psBGP provides data integrity (G3).
Proof Outline: psBGP uses the IPsec Encapsulating Se-
curity Payload (ESP) [21, 22] with null encryption for
protecting BGP sessions, and relies upon IPsec ESP for
data integrity.
Before presenting Proposition 4, we establish two
Lemmas.
Lemma 1 Assume that ∀si ∈ S,∃sj ∈ peer(si) such
that sj carries out reasonable due diligence to create a
proper preﬁx assertion (f sj

ASes are in collusion (A2)3, then psBGP provides rea-
sonable assurance of preﬁx ownership veriﬁcation, i.e.,

Lemma 2 psBGP provides reasonable assurance of IP
preﬁx aggregation veriﬁcation.
Proof Outline: Let fg be a preﬁx aggregated by AS sx
from a set of routes {mi = (fi, pi)|pi = [si, . . . ]} re-
ceived by sx. psBGP requires that for fg originated by
sx to be veriﬁed as proper, sx must either own a preﬁx fx
such that fg ⊆ fx (veriﬁed by Lemma 1), or provide evi-
dence that sx has in fact received {mi} and fg ⊆ ∪{fi}.
Valid digital signatures from each AS on p i can serve as
evidence that sx has received {m} (see Proposition 5).
If fg ⊆ ∪{fi}, then sx aggregates fg properly. If sx
cannot provide required evidence, s x’s aggregation of
fg is veriﬁed as improper. This establishes Lemma 2.
Proposition 4 psBGP provides reasonable assurance
of IP preﬁx origination veriﬁcation, i.e., an AS s i’s orig-
ination of a preﬁx f is veriﬁed as proper if f is owned by
si or is aggregated properly by si from a set of routes re-
ceived by si. Otherwise, si’s origination of f is veriﬁed
as improper.

not own f and si does not provide proof of the propriety

f as improper. This establishes Proposition 4.

Proposition 5 psBGP provides assurance of AS PATH
veriﬁcation (G5).
Proof Outline: Let mk = (f1, pk) be a BGP route,
where pk = [s1, s2, . . . , sk]). Let ri (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1)
be a BGP speaker in si which has originated (i = 1) or
forwarded (2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) mi to si+1. In psBGP, the
integrity of pk implies that mk has traversed the exact
sequence of s1, s2, . . . , sk. In other words, there does
not exist i (2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) such that si−1 didn’t send
(f1, [s1, . . . , si−1]) to si.
By way of contradiction, assume that it is possible
in psBGP that (f1, [s1, . . . , sk]) is accepted by a BGP
speaker rk+1 and there exists i (2 ≤ i < k) such that
si−1 didn’t send (f1, [s1, . . . , si−1]) to si. psBGP re-
quires that for [s1, s2, . . . , sk] to be accepted by rk+1,
∀i (1 ≤ i < k), ri+1 has received a valid digital sig-
nature {p1, [s1, . . . , si], vi[
]}si where the bit in vi[ ]
corresponding to si+1 is set. {p1, [s1, . . . , si], vi[ ]}si
serves as a signed assertion that si does send that routing
update to si+1. This contradicts the above assumption.
Thus, Proposition 5 is established.
The above results establish the desired psBGP secu-
rity properties, and are summarized by Theorem 1.
Theorem 1 (psBGP Security Property) psBGP
achieves the following ﬁve security goals: AS number
authentication (G1), BGP speaker authentication (G2),
data integrity (G3), IP preﬁx origination veriﬁcation
(G4), and AS PATH veriﬁcation (G5).
5. S-BGP, soBGP, and psBGP Comparison
We compare the different approaches taken by S-BGP,
soBGP, and psBGP for achieving the BGP security goals
listed in §2.4. Table 2 provides a summary. We see that
psBGP falls somewhere between S-BGP and soBGP in
several of the security approaches and architectural de-
sign decisions, but makes distinct design choices in sev-
eral others.
5.1. AS Number Authentication
Both S-BGP and psBGP use a centralized trust model
for authenticating AS numbers, which is different from
the web-of-trust model used by soBGP. The difference
between the AS number authentication of psBGP and S-
BGP is that S-BGP follows the existing structure of AS
number assignment more strictly than psBGP. In S-BGP,
an AS number is assigned by IANA to an organization
and it is an organization that creates and signs a certiﬁ-
cate binding an AS number to a public key (thus, a two-
step chain). In psBGP, an ASNumCert is signed directly
by IANA (depth=1), and is independent of the name of
an organization. Thus, psBGP has less certiﬁcate man-
agement overhead than S-BGP, requiring fewer certiﬁ-
cates. In addition, some changes in an organization X
may not require revoking and reissuing the public key

certiﬁcate of the AS controlled by X. For example, if
X changes its name to Y but the AS number s associ-
ated with X does not change, psBGP does not need to
revoke the ASNumCert (ks, s)T . However, in S-BGP,
the public key certiﬁcates (kX , X)T , (ks, s)kX might be
revoked, and new certiﬁcates (kY , Y )T , (k(cid:1)
, s)kY might
be issued.

5.2. BGP Speaker Authentication
In S-BGP, a public key certiﬁcate is issued to each
BGP speaker, while both soBGP and psBGP use one
common public key certiﬁcate for all speakers within
one AS. Thus, soBGP and psBGP require fewer BGP
speaker certiﬁcates (albeit requiring secure distribution
of a common private key to all speakers in an AS).
5.3. Data Integrity
S-BGP uses IPsec for protecting BGP session and
data integrity. Both soBGP and psBGP adopt this ap-
proach. TCP MD5 [18] is supported by all three propos-
als for backward compatibility. In addition, automatic
key management mechanisms can be implemented for
improving the security of TCP MD5.
egation among ASes. It appears that soBGP simpliﬁes
the delegation structure and requires fewer certiﬁcates
for veriﬁcation; however, it is not clear if it is feasible
to do so in practice since IP addresses are usually dele-
gated between organizations, not ASes. In psBGP, con-
sistency checks of PALs of direct peers are performed
to verify if it is proper for an AS to originate an IP pre-
ﬁx. Therefore, psBGP does not involve veriﬁcation of
chains of certiﬁcates (instead relying on ofﬂine due dili-
gence). We note that while psBGP does not guarantee
perfect security of the authorization of IP address allo-
cation or delegation, as intended by S-BGP and soBGP,
as discussed in §1 it is not clear if the design intent in
the latter two can actually be met in practice.
5.5. AS PATH Veriﬁcation
Both S-BGP and psBGP verify the integrity of
AS PATH based on its deﬁnition in the BGP speciﬁca-
tion [35]. In contrast, soBGP veriﬁes the plausibility of
an AS PATH. Thus, S-BGP and psBGP provide stronger
security of AS PATH than soBGP, at the cost of digi-
tal signature operations which might slow down network
convergence.

6. Performance Analysis of psBGP
Both S-BGP and soBGP propose a hierarchical struc-
ture for authorization of the IP address space; however
