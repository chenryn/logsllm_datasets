User: I have this python script that outputs the Twitter Stream to my terminal console. Now here is the interesting thing:
* On snowleopard I get all the data I want.
* On Ubuntu (my pc) this data is limited and older data is deleted.
Both terminal consoles operate in Bash, so it has to be an OS thing presumably.
My question is: how do I turn this off? I want to leave my computer on for a week to capture around 1 or 2 gigabytes of data, for my bachelor thesis!
Assistant: I'd also avoid doing this with a terminal, but to answer the question directly:

right click on the terminal window
profiles
profile preferences
scolling
scollback: unlimited

It's better though to redirect to a file, then access that file.  "tail -f" is very helpful.
