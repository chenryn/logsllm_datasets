User: How to close a section of network to prevent external attacks?
Assistant: The following are some measures to prevent external attacks: 1. Use a firewall: Deploying a firewall can restrict external IP access to the network and only allow authorized IP access, thereby reducing unauthorized access. 2. Update system patches: Regularly update server operating system and software patches to eliminate possible vulnerabilities. 3. Password policy: Use strong passwords and enforce regular password changes to prevent hackers from invading by cracking passwords. 4. VPN connection: Provide VPN connection for the network, and the security of transmitted data can be improved through encryption technology. 5. Filter: Enable the filter to control the traffic in and out of the network, which can prevent some malicious software or data packets from entering the network. 6. Multi-factor authentication: For sensitive systems or accounts, multi-factor authentication is required during login and other key operations to increase the access threshold.
