### Experiment A.1: Average Relative Standard Deviation of Loss Estimates

**Figure 6.** This figure illustrates the average relative standard deviation (RSD) of loss estimates for a common link in 2-leaf and 5-leaf trees under two different loss models. The RSD is plotted against the true loss rate \( f \) using our PL-based inference approach.

- **Observations:**
  - As the true loss rate \( f \) increases, the relative standard deviation of the estimates decreases. This is expected because, at higher loss rates, the end-to-end loss is more likely to be due to the common link, reducing the influence of other parameters.
  - The bias (dotted curves) derived from Equation (12) works well for both 2-leaf and 5-leaf trees, even though it was initially derived for the 2-leaf tree case.

### Experiment A.2: PL-based Loss Estimates for Large Trees

**Figure 7.** This figure shows the average relative bias and standard deviations of three types of loss estimates as the number of leaves \( K \) increases from 2 to 40. The common link loss rate is fixed at 5%, and the number of pair measurements remains at 5000. The leaf weights are sampled independently from an exponential distribution, leading to a skewed distribution of packet pairs among leaf branches.

- **Estimation Methods:**
  - **est.equal:** Assumes the same end-to-end success rate for all leaf branches.
  - **est.self:** Uses empirical end-to-end success rates, which may be skewed.
  - **est.true:** Uses the true end-to-end success rates as a reference.

- **Observations:**
  - For small \( K \), est.equal (solid curves) is slightly worse than est.self (dashed curves) due to the introduced bias from assuming uniform end-to-end loss rates.
  - As \( K \) increases (around \( K = 10 \)), est.equal performs almost as well as est.true, while est.self degrades significantly. This is because some leaf links do not receive enough samples, making it difficult to estimate the end-to-end loss rates accurately.
  - Est.equal is robust to the differences in sample sizes among leaf links, allowing for better estimation of the common link loss rate.

### Experiment A.3: Bias When the Loss Correlation Model is Unknown

**Figure 8.** This figure compares the average relative bias of loss estimates under the true (linear) correlation model (est.true, solid curve) and the best-fitting model (est.bestmodel, dotted curve) for a 5-leaf tree. The true loss rate \( f \) is varied, and the bias of est.bestmodel is found to be acceptably small (around 5% negative bias) compared to est.true. This is much better than the 20% bias observed when using the wrong model.

### Network Simulation Using ns2

**Objective:** To evaluate the performance of our PL-based inference approach under realistic traffic conditions and large network topologies, particularly focusing on scenarios where the time correlation function is challenging to model.

**Simulation Setup:**
- **Traffic Generation:**
  - Short-lived TCP flows with Poisson arrival process (mean 10ms) and exponentially distributed duration (mean 1s).
  - Background UDP on-off flows to add variance.
  - Packets are sent from the root to uniformly chosen leaf branches.
- **Loss Rate Estimation Approaches:**
  - **est.equal:** Uses the same end-to-end success rate to remove skewness.
  - **est.self:** Directly uses the end-to-end success rates, which may be skewed.
  - **est.perfect:** Assumes perfect loss correlation and uses end-to-end success rates.

**Experiment B.1: ON-OFF Loss Model**

- **Topology:** Two-level tree with a common link at the root and varying leaf branches.
- **Bandwidth and Delay:**
  - Common link: 5Mb/s
  - Leaf branches: 1Mb/s
  - Propagation delay: 5ms
- **Loss Models:**
  - No leaf loss: Losses only occur in the common link.
  - With leaf losses: Losses occur in both the common link and leaf links (with 0% or 2% loss).

**Results:**
- **No Leaf Loss (Figure 9a):**
  - Both est.equal and est.self have smaller inference error rates than est.perfect.
  - Est.perfect's performance degrades because it assumes perfect correlation, which can lead to incorrect assumptions about packet loss patterns.
- **With Leaf Losses (Figure 9b):**
  - Similar trends are observed, but the presence of leaf losses introduces additional variability.

This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of our PL-based inference approach under various network conditions and loss models.
