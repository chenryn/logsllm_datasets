“Intelligence” by Susan Hasler (Thomas Dunne Books. St. Martin’s Press: New York 
2010) 
A review by Richard Thieme 
There is enough white-hot rage in this book to steam a skunk. 
Take that as a compliment. Twenty-one years at the CIA in diverse capacities would 
generate post-traumatic stress in anyone, but not many can pen a narrative that addresses 
the relevant characters, issues, and complexities of that tenure. “Intelligence” pretty much 
does, within the constraints of agency pre-publication review.  
This book is more or less true, I believe, to its ultimate purpose, which is to channel the 
complex, sometimes contradictory vectors of energy that warred within the author during 
her 21 years of service into characters with conflicting points of view, emotions, and 
allegiances. If there is a flaw in the book, it is that those conflicts result in a “happy 
ending” at odds with the headlines, if not today’s, then certainly tomorrow’s. 
“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free,” reads the ironic quote at the 
entrance to the CIA, ironic because the biblical quote refers to that transcendent truth that 
includes and surpasses all lesser allegiances (which the biblical narrative casts as various 
forms of idolatry) whereas the agency is fused with the lesser purposes of the nation state 
that sanctions its work and methods. (I once asked a Naval intelligence analyst about the 
sticky problem of “intelligence ethics,” and he said, “we have a code: don’t lie, don’t 
cheat, don’t steal. But it doesn’t say, Don’t kill. That’s why we exist.”) 
It gets messy, once one is assimilated into the “inside circle” of an agency like the CIA 
where those higher imperatives are lopped off at the start from the definition of the 
mission. Over time the addictive drug of being an insider consumes one. Having access to 
inside information, knowing what others can only guess, and often guess wrong, 
receiving reinforcement only from one’s cohorts for the privilege of being special, 
exempt, and in the know, receiving permission to violate legal or ethical norms that 
outsiders must acknowledge from time to time ... over time, this leads to a murky mix in 
which the struggle to do one’s job, keep one’s job, and keep one’s soul more or less intact 
... well, it all gets messy, over time.  
And over time, intense bonds of collegiality and friendship and the pressures of keeping 
secrets and working together in the trenches bond soldiers to one another. That’s depicted 
vividly in this book. So inevitably tensions mount when there is a political agenda and 
directive to distort intelligence on behalf of a political purpose, particularly when it 
makes the practitioner of the craft look stupid or inept despite the facts.  
Yes, that has always been true, a friend of mine at one of the agencies said. But post 9/11, 
it got much worse. Many of us hated what the administration did to paint us as the bad 
guys, when they were lying and deceiving while we were trying to do our jobs. They only 
wanted results that supported a predetermined agenda, namely, to go to war in Iraq, with 
predictable consequences. When we warned that such a war would fan the flames of jihad 
worldwide, we were summarily dismissed – as characters in this book, so warning, are 
dismissed.  
All that, I believe, is one source of the anger in this work. Oh, there’s humor, yes, 
amusing incidents and relationships, that ameliorate the fury, but the white-hot fire burns 
through cracks like the flames in a pot-belly stove. So one obvious subtext of this book is 
to pay back those responsible for that distortion and what it did personally to those in the 
trenches who could not mount a podium and shout denials in response. All they could do 
was leak it, hint it, and when they could, put it into  fictional form.  
Another subtext results from the author’s twenty-one years of growing frustration at the 
self-interested territory-and-career protecting agendas and behaviors that make a person 
crazy inside the agency – and inside other organizations, too, of course (an executive of a 
large bank told me they spend at least 60% of their time in internal politics, like a whale 
regulating its internal temperature so it doesn’t cook from the inside out). Everyone of a 
certain age knows that it is the unwritten rules that say how one had better behave in an 
organizational culture and that one violates those rules to ones personal and professional 
peril. That awareness informs this book in both positive and negative ways – positive 
because the writer, Susan Hasler, was sufficiently motivated to disclose all this in the 
guise of fiction, but negative because it turns the narrative into a wish-fulfillment, a tale 
of how she hopes or wishes it would turn out in the actual agency, the real world. A wish 
fulfillment is a dream, as Freud said,  and a dream does not always make for good 
literature. Think of the movie “Chinatown” with the alternative happy ending that wasn’t 
used, Evelyn Mulwray killing Noah Cross, getting off free, hitching up with Jake, and the 
whole corrupt mess exposed and dismantled. 
In the real world, it doesn’t happen that way. That’s why Roman Polanski’s canny 
version won out, and why the film lasts. Layers of corrupt allegiances and practices have 
more than nine lives and hide better, too, than any cat.    
So any sane person would become angry, dealing with all that but muzzled by secrecy 
agreements. Yet ... this fictional narrative of work in the “Mines” as the trenches of daily 
intelligence operations are called, saw the light of day fairly quickly. I know former 
intelligence professionals whose attempts to publish were long stalled or so censored that 
the remaining text made the work unpublishable. I recall Melissa Mahle, who had hoped 
to make a speech on rendition for an intelligence ethics conference, removing herself 
from the agenda because the agency had “gutted her talk” by removing 75% of it – not 
because the details were unknown but because her speech would affirm them. Publication 
in the media allowed for “no comment” or plausible deniability. Her speech would not. 
So it wasn’t that people didn’t know, but that they did not know “officially” and it is 
official truth that matters.  
That in fact is a major theme of this book, that “official truth” and the truth that sets you 
free often conflict. The dream is that the half-mad intelligence agent, Maddie, will have 
her day before Congress and cameras and expose the “real bad guys” and set the agency 
right again, that is, realign the CIA or an alternative part of it anyway with its real task, to 
gather intelligence and provide it in a useful form for leaders with some modicum of 
integrity and the desire to use it in the right way. It is ironic, of course, that it takes 
someone who has gone over the edge and thrown caution to the wind to speak the simple 
truth.  
In short, the fact that this book is out, in this form, means that this is a story somebody 
wanted told.  The distortion of intelligence, bent to political agendas in ways that cost 
lives and careers, distortion as both policy and practice, must enrage many senior 
practitioners of the craft. Some of them want us to know, that while they can not mount 
the podium and speak, they can allow a “fictionalized” account to make their point. 
I returned to writing fiction myself when a friend at one of the agencies said, in effect, 
you can’t talk about the things we talk about unless you write fiction. It’s the only way 
you can tell the truth. The result was “Mind Games,” nineteen stories of edgy anomalies 
published earlier this year  (www.thiemeworks.com). It is only a hunch, of course, but an 
informed hunch, that a similar motivation fueled the writing of this novel.  
The public biography of Susan Hasler also suggests some other conflicts that generated 
the heat and light in this book. She was an intelligence analyst, which gives credibility to 
detailed scenes of inside-the-agency dynamics revealing the frustrations, political strife, 
and personal interactions that keep us reading. If this were only fiction, that is, rather than 
a wink-wink nod-nod peek inside, some of the narrative might be of less interest. The 
conflicts at the heart of the narrative derive at least some of their interest from the overlay 
our brains constantly provide, comparing and contrasting the “real” world of the past ten 
years with events in the book.  
Hasler’s biography also states that she wrote speeches for three directors of Central 
Intelligence and one director of the National Recognizance Office. Having written a few 
speeches for others myself, always as a “ghost,” I know that this means an ability to get 
inside the mind of another, to see the world through their eyes like some empathetic 
science fiction alien taking over the apparatus of an earthling, speaking in their own 
words, from their perspectives. That same empathy and ability to hold multiple points of 
view in creative tension while managing one’s own cognitive dissonance until some 
integration of data takes place, that testifies to Hasler’s street cred and significant abilities 
as a counter terrorism and Soviet analyst as well. Her years of experience are evident.  
So Hasler had to learn to manage all that, do her work, keep her job, keep her cats healthy 
like one of the characters, and stay reasonably sane. The ability to manage multiple 
personalities and perspectives and remember how to come home to one’s own (while 
reading details of ingenious ways others are planning to kill us)  distinguishes someone 
who is bitterly sane from one who is over the line and as crazed as the character Maddie 
threatens to become. Maddie seems to be an alter-ego who carries the rage on behalf of 
the group that is not allowed to do their work. The affirmation of Maddie’s vision is one 
way for the author to remain loyal to the ultimate truth. The challenge is to find a way to 
integrate Maddie’s loyalty to the higher purpose of both agency and world with 
allegiance to the nation state and all its bad actors and detours and do justice to it all.   
But as I said, the resolutions in the book are probably more wish fulfillment than fact, as 
much as “outsiders” can know or guess. How often the employees of the CIA stand and 
turn their backs en masse on a director they have learned to disrespect is a matter of 
conjecture. But celebrating the possibility is obviously a therapeutic path for this author 
who spent so many years unable to speak “outside” of what she knew and is now 
searching for a suitable voice that enables multiple streams of her life to come together—
a fact which leads Maddie in the book but the author as well, perhaps, to conclude that 
leaving the agency for a dull academic life would condemn her to boredom and 
irrelevance, once one has been inside. Academics may pontificate at length but don’t 
know what they don’t know or even that they don’t know. Life “outside” is literally 
unthinkable, a de facto lobotomy, except as a daydream that enables one to make it 
through the day. Think of Henry Hill in the movie “Goodfellas,” just a schnook in the 
witness protection program, instead of the adrenalin junkie who loved a life of crime 
despite its pitfalls.  
In the final dream-wish of the book, a vindicated and triumphant Maddie remains to 
direct an “alternative” track whose job is to take names and kick ass, which she 
anticipates doing with relish and glee, and to keep the agency safe for those who not only 
seek the truth in all of its forms but seek as well to speak truth to power and live to speak 
another day.  
If only. 
Another personal aside: I was once advised by a therapist to read about trauma because 
my interaction with those who had been tortured and those who torture others had pushed 
me over a line. “You’re showing symptoms of  secondary trauma,” she said.   
So is Susan Hasler, I believe, in this novel, and the book strikes me as an attempt to 
reconcile the multiple conflicts of which I have written and find peace. Having projected 
her mind and heart into the persona of three DCIs, having done years of detailed research 
with access to data most don’t know and spent sleepless nights rehearsing the dire threats, 
imagining the psyches of Soviets and terrorists and putting herself in their places as much 
as in the directors’ speeches, splicing her mind to the purposes of others, she must now 
take back the strings of all those marionettes and make her own soul dance to a tune 
congruent with her deeper commitments and the self she remains.  
Her loyalties did clearly include those in the trenches, her brothers and sisters, who 
bonded  in the face of the live fire of real threats, trying to act on behalf of the higher 
good that once motivated their youthful hearts. Those loyalties are tested in the context of 
the bitter truths of political life that veterans like Hasler know and can never unlearn. The 
terrorists’ threats and actions, presented as the main narrative thread, are intense but less 
emotionally dense than the conflicts of the professionals in the trenches. That’s where 
Hesler lived her life, after all, and decades of  interfacing with those diverse people and 
agendas, as abrasive as hair shirts, requires one imagines a certain amount of purging. . 
The “enemy,” then, is the “voice with many names” that articulates in brief the ethos of 
Islamic terrorists, but also intelligence professionals themselves, and bureaucrats, and 
political hacks. That fact has serious consequences. As career goals eclipse counter-
terrorism efforts and political spin eclipses facts about a world that can never be perfectly 
secured, the real threats of terrorism are amplified. A la “coming in from the cold,” the 
author tells us aside how bad it really is, how enraging to watch television “news” 
programs juxtapose images to create an unthinking sheeplike population that neither 
knows the truth nor how to find it as it is led to war and more.   
The author no doubt knows the beltway joke, that the CIA we think exists is not the real 
CIA, but a front projected into the world to convince enemies we can not do intelligence 
properly. The real work of a real CIA is hidden in some bunker in the hills of Virginia.  
That’s the CIA with which the author chooses to identify. That’s the one to which she 
believes she belongs.  
Perhaps that’s true for all of us, one way or another.  Perhaps that’s how we all live with 
ourselves.  
I strongly recommend this book. It is really worth reading. The author, having left the 
agency after decades of work, remains in her brain inside the “real CIA,” in a spin cycle 
that may go on for the rest of her life “outside.” The rest of us can only speculate and 
guess, and watch as growing numbers of intelligence workers commute from suburbia, 
park in vast lots, then disappear into doors in the sides of hills which from the air look 
just like grass. All we know at the end is that they disappear into doors to which “we the 
people” do not for the moment have keys and they can only report their experience in 
veiled and sanctioned ways.
