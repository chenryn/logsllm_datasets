**Book Review: "Intelligence" by Susan Hasler**

**Reviewed by Richard Thieme**

Susan Hasler's "Intelligence" (Thomas Dunne Books, St. Martinâ€™s Press, 2010) is a searing and incisive novel that channels the author's two-decade tenure at the CIA into a narrative of conflicting loyalties, ethical dilemmas, and the inner workings of one of the world's most secretive agencies. The book brims with white-hot rage, a testament to the post-traumatic stress that can accumulate over years of service in such a high-stakes environment.

Hasler's narrative is a complex tapestry of characters, each embodying different facets of the intelligence community. The story is grounded in the realities of agency life, constrained by the pre-publication review process, yet it manages to convey the intricate dynamics and moral ambiguities that define this world. The author skillfully translates her experiences into a fictional narrative, creating a vivid and often unsettling portrait of life within the CIA.

One of the book's strengths is its ability to capture the emotional and psychological toll of working in an environment where truth is often malleable and loyalty is tested. The central character, Maddie, serves as an alter-ego for the author, carrying the weight of the collective frustration and anger felt by many in the trenches. Her journey is a reflection of the internal conflicts that arise when personal integrity clashes with institutional demands.

However, the book is not without its flaws. The "happy ending" feels somewhat at odds with the grim realities of the intelligence world, both past and present. This wish-fulfillment narrative, while satisfying on one level, may strike some readers as overly optimistic. The real world, as Hasler well knows, is far more complex and less forgiving.

The novel also delves into the ethical quagmires that intelligence professionals face, particularly in the post-9/11 era. The distortion of intelligence for political purposes, the pressure to conform to predetermined agendas, and the personal and professional costs of speaking truth to power are all explored with unflinching honesty. Hasler's background as a speechwriter for high-ranking officials adds a layer of authenticity to these depictions, as she brings to life the multiple perspectives and internal struggles of those in power.

The book's subtext is a powerful critique of the "official truth" that often diverges from the reality experienced by those on the ground. The dream of a vindicated Maddie, standing before Congress and exposing the "real bad guys," is a cathartic moment, but it also underscores the deep-seated frustration and disillusionment that many in the intelligence community feel.

Hasler's writing is informed by her extensive experience, including her work as an intelligence analyst and speechwriter. This background lends credibility to the detailed and nuanced portrayal of agency life, making the narrative both compelling and believable. The reader is drawn into a world where the lines between right and wrong are often blurred, and where the stakes are nothing less than the security of the nation.

In the end, "Intelligence" is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the CIA. It is a story of loyalty, betrayal, and the relentless pursuit of truth in a world where the truth is often hidden behind layers of secrecy and deception. While the resolution may be more aspirational than realistic, the book remains a poignant and necessary read for anyone interested in the complexities of the intelligence community.

I strongly recommend "Intelligence" to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the human side of espionage and the moral challenges faced by those who serve in the shadows. It is a book that will stay with you long after the final page is turned.
