### Title: Breaking the IIoT: Hacking Industrial Control Gateways

**Abstract:**

Industrial control gateways are essential components that connect critical infrastructure to centralized management systems. These gateways are found in a wide range of applications, including power grids (such as transformer stations and solar fields), city infrastructure (like traffic lights and tunnel control systems), and large industrial plants (such as automotive and chemical facilities).

In recent years, these gateways have been exploited in high-profile cyberattacks, notably in Ukraine in 2015 and Saudi Arabia in 2018. This presentation delves into the security vulnerabilities of these gateways, covering various attack vectors from communication protocol exploitation to reverse engineering and fuzzing of proprietary firmware and protocols.

The session will culminate in a live demonstration, showcasing the vulnerabilities on actual devices. The findings highlight significant security shortcomings in industrial control gateways from multiple vendors, underscoring the need for enhanced security measures in critical infrastructure.
