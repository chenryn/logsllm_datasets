**User:**
I would like to build an application on Google App Engine using Python that is fully connected to a single Gmail account. The application should be able to filter emails from this account (e.g., filter messages containing a specific string and display them). In the future, I also plan to implement the functionality to send messages. 

What is the most efficient way to achieve this, preferably using a solution provided by Google?

**Assistant:**
Google App Engine does not provide a direct API for Gmail. However, you can still achieve your goals by using a combination of Google's services.

One approach is to set up email forwarding from the Gmail account to a custom email address that your Google App Engine application can process. This method allows you to receive and handle emails in your application, but it requires setting up forwarding rules in the Gmail account.

For more advanced email processing, including filtering and sending messages, I recommend using the **Gmail API**. While the Gmail API is not directly integrated with Google App Engine, you can use it in conjunction with **Google Apps Script**, which provides a rich set of functions for interacting with Gmail. Google Apps Script uses JavaScript, and you can easily set up communication between your Google Apps Script and your Google App Engine application.

Here’s a high-level overview of the steps you can follow:

1. **Set Up Email Forwarding (Optional):**
   - Configure the Gmail account to forward incoming emails to a custom email address.
   - Set up your Google App Engine application to receive and process these forwarded emails.

2. **Use Google Apps Script with the Gmail API:**
   - Create a Google Apps Script project to interact with the Gmail API.
   - Implement the necessary functions to filter and send emails.
   - Use HTTP requests to communicate between your Google Apps Script and your Google App Engine application.

This approach leverages the strengths of both Google App Engine and Google Apps Script, providing a robust and flexible solution for your requirements.
