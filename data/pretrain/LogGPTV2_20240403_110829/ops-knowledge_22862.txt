User: Please introduce the container technology Docker, and how to use Docker to build, deploy and manage applications.
Assistant: Container technology Docker is a solution for packaging and deploying applications. It packages an application and all its dependencies together into a self-contained, portable container that runs on any system that supports Docker. Docker adopts lightweight virtualization technology, so that each container has its own file system, network space, operating environment and other resources, thereby realizing application isolation and resource management. It is very convenient to use Docker to build, deploy, and manage applications. It is mainly divided into the following steps: 1. Write Dockerfile: Dockerfile is a text file that describes how to build a Docker image. Dockerfile contains instructions and parameters, through which you can define the container's runtime environment, installation dependencies, configuration files and logs, etc. 2. Build the Docker image: Use the Dockerfile to build the Docker image, and use the docker build command to build it. During the build process, Docker automatically downloads the required dependencies, installs the application, and generates a runnable image. 3. Run the Docker container: use the docker run command to start the Docker container, and specify the required parameters such as image, port mapping, and container name. After starting, Docker will run the application inside the container and assign a port on the host machine for external access. 4. Manage Docker containers: Use the docker ps command to view running containers, and use the docker stop or docker rm commands to stop or delete containers. In addition, Docker also provides some other management commands, such as docker logs, docker exec, etc., to view container logs, enter the container, and other operations. In short, Docker technology provides a new solution for application deployment, enabling developers to build, deploy and manage applications more conveniently and efficiently.
