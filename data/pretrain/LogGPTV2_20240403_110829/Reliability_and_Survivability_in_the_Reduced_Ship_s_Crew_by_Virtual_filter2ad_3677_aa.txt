## Abstract
The Reduced Ship’s Crew by Virtual Presence (RSVP) Advanced Technology Demonstration was a three-year program (1999-2001) aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of employing wireless sensors on naval ships. The demonstration included environmental, structural, personnel, and machinery sensors. This paper describes the RSVP architecture, emphasizing the aspects that contribute to the system's reliability and survivability. It also details the demonstrations conducted and their results.

## 1. Introduction
Navies around the world are seeking to build ships that are less costly to construct, maintain, and operate. The role of dependable electronics in achieving these goals is crucial. Reducing crew size can lower operating costs, but this must be balanced with the need to replace the information provided by human sensors. Assuming that the solution will come from large numbers of networked sensors and computers, the Office of Naval Research commissioned the RSVP Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) [1,2,3] to develop a proof-of-concept system.

The ATD was based on several presumptions:
- Wireless technology would reduce installation and maintenance costs.
- The sensor system must be reliable, stable, and have low power utilization, achieved through microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors.
- Alternative power sources, such as energy harvesting devices, would be needed to minimize battery maintenance.
- The sensor system, installed on a warship, must have high availability and be survivable to contribute to the ship’s overall survivability.

The goal of the RSVP ATD was to demonstrate the feasibility of a system embodying these features. The focus was on a single compartment, although an operational installation would instrument most, if not all, compartments on a ship.

Sensors were demonstrated in four functional areas:
- **Environmental sensors** monitored ambient conditions and damage-related phenomena.
- **Structural sensors** monitored the condition of the ship’s hull.
- **Personnel sensors** monitored physiological conditions and tracked individuals as they moved between compartments.
- **Machinery sensors** monitored conditions on a ship’s service gas turbine generator and fire pump.

The culmination of the ATD was a series of demonstrations, summarized in Table 1.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. System Components
The RSVP system architecture, shown in Figure 1, consists of the following elements:
- **Sensor units**
- **Access Points (APs)**
- **System Health Monitor (SHM)**
- **Ship’s local area network (LAN)**
- **Watchstation**

#### Sensor Units
- **Environmental Sensor Clusters (ESCs)**: Mounted on convenient structures to monitor the ship’s internal environment. They include internal sensors for temperature, smoke, ionization, humidity, air pressure, flooding, oxygen, carbon monoxide levels, and acoustic transients. An external interface monitors hatch closure. ESCs communicate wirelessly with APs using low-power radio transmissions.
- **Structural Sensor Clusters (SSCs)**: Mounted on beams and the hull to monitor structural parameters. SSCs include internal sensors for temperature and external interfaces for strain, seaway acceleration, and shock. They communicate wirelessly with APs.
- **Intelligent Component Health Monitors (ICHMs)**: Obtain data from transducers mounted on machines, including temperature, acceleration, and electrical measurements. ICHMs and SHMs are powered by ship’s power but communicate wirelessly.
- **Personnel Status Monitors (PSMs)**: Worn by individuals to monitor heartbeat, axillary temperature, spatial orientation, and acceleration. PSMs transmit vital signs once per minute and location data every 15 seconds when stationary or moving slowly, and every second when moving quickly.

#### Access Points (APs)
APs interface between the sensor units and the ship’s backbone LAN. They communicate wirelessly with sensor units and SHMs, and via the LAN with Watchstations and other APs. APs exchange data within the same compartment to ensure each has a complete version of all data. They use data fusion algorithms to detect alert or alarm conditions and suppress false alarms. One AP in each compartment is responsible for transmitting data and information to the Watchstation.

Each AP incorporates a camera and microphone, with audio and video compressed and stored in a loop recorder implemented with hard-drive memory.

#### System Health Monitor (SHM)
SHMs manage data from ICHMs and communicate with APs using IEEE 802.11. In the future, machines may have built-in ICHMs and SHMs, allowing the SHM to manage internal data and communicate with the rest of the ship via APs.

#### Ship’s Local Area Network (LAN)
It was assumed that future warships would have a reliable, survivable LAN as part of their infrastructure, implemented with switched network technology to reconfigure paths around failed or damaged components.

#### Watchstation
The Watchstation serves as the interface with the ship’s operators, presenting information on a display terminal and taking commands via user input devices. The operator can request alarm information, specific data, live or “instant replay” video, and audio from any AP.

### 2.2. Power Management
Sensor Clusters are designed to operate for five to ten years without maintenance. They are powered by energy-harvesting technologies, such as devices that generate electricity from heat, light, or vibration, backed up by batteries. The design minimizes power usage, with Sensor Clusters periodically powering up from sleep, sampling transducers, and transmitting data if necessary.

## 3. Demonstrations
Table 1 summarizes the RSVP demonstrations, which included:
- **Functionality under realistic conditions**: Conducted at a land-based engineering site with actual machinery and simulated failures.
- **Functionality under operational conditions**: Conducted on USS Monterey (CG-61) both pier-side and at sea.
- **Functionality during damage-control conditions**: Conducted on ex-USS Shadwell (LSD-15) in Mobile, Alabama.
- **Functionality in various compartments and passageways**: Conducted in February 2002.

## 4. Conclusions
The RSVP ATD successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a wireless sensor system for reducing ship’s crew while maintaining reliability and survivability. The system architecture, incorporating MEMS sensors, energy-harvesting power sources, and a robust communication network, showed promise for future naval applications.
