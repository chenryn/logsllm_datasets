ABSTRACT 
The  Reduced  Ship’s  Crew  by  Virtual  Presence 
Advanced  Technology  Demonstration  was  a  3-year 
program (1999-2001) to show the feasibility of employing 
wireless  sensors  on  naval  ships. 
  Environmental, 
structural,  personnel,  and  machinery  sensors  were 
demonstrated. 
This  paper  describes 
the  RSVP  architecture, 
highlighting the aspects of the architecture that contribute 
to  the  system’s  reliability  and  survivability.    It  also 
describes  the  demonstrations  that  were  performed  and 
their results.

INTRODUCTION 
Navies throughout the world are seeking to build ships 
that will be less costly to build, maintain, and operate than 
at  present.    The  role  of  electronics,  and  in  particular 
dependable electronics, in achieving these goals cannot be 
overstated.    Reductions  in  crew  size  will  contribute  to 
lower  operating  cost,  but  the  loss  of  information  from 
dozens to hundreds of sophisticated sensors – people – no 
longer  on  a  given  ship  must  be  addressed.    On  the 
assumption  that  the  solution  will  come  from  large 
numbers of networked sensors and computers employing 
technologies  that  are  currently  emerging,  the  Office  of 
Naval Research commissioned the Reduced Ship’s Crew 
by  Virtual  Presence  (RSVP)  Advanced  Technology 
Demonstration  (ATD)  [1,2,3]  to  develop  a  proof-of-
concept system.   
The  ATD  was  based  on  a  number  of  presumptions:  
The  employment  of  wireless  technology  will  result  in 
reductions  in  the  cost  of  installing  and  maintaining  the 
to 
the 
sensors.  To minimize the impact on maintenance cost, the 
sensor  system  must  be  reliable.    Reliability,  along  with 
stability  and  low  power  utilization,  will  come  from  the 
use  of  microelectromechanical  system  (MEMS)  sensors.  
Eliminating wiring while not relying on batteries and the 
attendant  maintenance  burden  implies  the  need  for 
alternative  power  sources,  such  as  energy  harvesting 
devices.    Since  the  sensor  system  will  be  installed  on  a 
warship  where

convenient  structures  to  monitor  the  ship’s  internal 
environment.    They  consist  of  internal  sensors,  a  low-
power processor, a low-power radio, and a wireless power 
source.    Internal  sensors  monitor  temperature,  smoke, 
ionization,  humidity,  air  pressure,  flooding  (via  a 
differential  pressure  sensor  connected  to  an  external 
pipette),  oxygen,  and  carbon  monoxide  levels,  and 
acoustic transients.  An external interface can be used to 
monitor  hatch  closure.    ESCs  communicate  wirelessly 
with APs, employing low-power radio transmissions.

Structural Sensor Clusters are mounted on beams and 
the  hull  to  monitor  parameters  related  to  the  ship’s 
structural  condition.    SSCs  consist  of  internal  sensors,  a 
low-power  processor,  a  low-power  radio,  and  a  wireless 
power  source.    Using  external  interfaces  to  instruments 
mounted  directly  on  beams  and  the  hull,  SSCs  monitor 
strain on the structural members, seaway acceleration, and 
shock.    The  only  internal  sensor  employed  by  an  SSC 
monitors  temperature.    SSCs  communicate  wirelessly 
with APs, employing low-power radio transmissions.  
Intelligent  Component  Health  Monitors  obtain  data 
from transducers mounted on a machine.  The data items 
vary  from  machine  to  machine,  and  include  parameters 
such  as 
temperature,  acceleration,  and  electrical 
measurements.  ICHMs and System Health Monitors are 
powered  by  ship’s  power  but  communicate  wirelessly.  
ICHMs  communicate  with  SHMs,  and  SHMs  in  turn 
communicate with Access Points, with IEEE 802.11 being 
employed in both cases.  While this communication chain 
would  appear  to  have  one  extra  link  –  indeed,  the  SHM 
functionality could have been implemented in the  APs – 
the  thought  is  that  in  the  future  machines  will  have  the 
equivalent  of  ICHMs  and  SHMs 
the 
manufacturer.  In that case, the SHM would manage data 
internal 
the  machine’s  electronics  and  would 
communicate with the rest of the ship via Access Points.

wearer’s well being and provide the means for the wearer 
to  be  located  on  the  ship  using  an  algorithm  based  on

signal  strength.    PSMs  consist  of  sensors,  low-power 
processors,  low-power  radios,  and  batteries.    PSMs 
monitor  the  individuals’  heartbeat,  axillary  temperature, 
spatial  orientation,  and  acceleration.    They  have  an 
“emergency”  button  and  can  be  in  an  online  or  offline 
mode;  the  latter  is  overridden  if  the  PSM  receives  a 
message that the ship has gone to General Quarters.  The 
PSM transmits vital signs once per minute, and transmits 
a message to aid the locating algorithm every 15 seconds 
when  the  wearer  is  stationary  or  moving  slowly,  and 
every  second  when  the  wearer  is  moving  quickly.    The 
one-second  transmissions  allow  a  wearer  to  be  tracked

Figure 1.  RSVP System Architecture  
Other  classes  of  sensor  units,  such  as  sensors 
incorporated in ordnance and materiel and personal digital 
assistants, could easily be accommodated by RSVP. 
Access  Points  are  the  interface  between  the  sensor 
units  and  the  ship’s  backbone  LAN.    APs  communicate 
with  sensor  units  and  SHMs  wirelessly,  and  with 
Watchstations and other APs via the LAN.  APs exchange 
data with other APs in the same compartment so that each 
has a complete version of all the data in that compartment.  
APs employ data fusion algorithms to determine whether 
alert  or  alarm  conditions  exist,  and  to  suppress  false 
alarms.  For example, an alert exists if a single SC detects 
an  abnormal  condition,  while  an  alarm  is  generated  if 
multiple SCs concur that an abnormal condition exists; in 
the case of fire detection, multiple sensors in a single ESC 
must  concur  for  there  to  be  an  alert.    One  AP  in  a 
compartment  is  responsible  for  transmitting  appropriate 
data and information to the Watchstation. 
Each  Access  Point 
incorporates  a  camera  and 
microphone.  Audio and video are compressed and stored 
in a loop recorder implemented with hard-drive memory.   
It was assumed that warships of the future would have 
a  reliable,  survivable  LAN  installed  as  part  of  its 
infrastructure.  Also assumed was that the LAN would be 
implemented with a switched network technology, which 
allows paths to be reconfigured around failed or damaged

The  RSVP  demonstrations  employed  a  Watchstation 
dedicated  to  RSVP,  but  in  an  operationally  deployed 
system  the  Watchstation  functions  would  be  integrated 
into 
general-purpose  Watchstations.  
Watchstations are the interface with the ship’s operators, 
presenting  information  on  a  display  terminal  and  taking 
commands  via  user  input  devices  such  as  keyboard  and 
trackball.  The operator can request alarm information or 
specific  data  from  a  compartment,  as  well  as  live  or 
“instant replay” video and audio from any Access Point.   
Sensor  Clusters  are  intended  to  operate  between  five 
and ten  years  without  maintenance.  To accomplish this, 
Sensor Clusters were designed to be powered by energy-
harvesting technologies – devices that generate electricity 
from  heat,  light,  or  vibration  –  backed  up  by  batteries.  
The  use  of  these  low-capacity  power  sources  dictates  a 
design  that  minimizes  power  usage.    Sensor  Clusters 
operate  by  periodically  (1  Hz)  powering  up  from  sleep, 
applying power to transducers, sampling the transducers, 
making a decision as to whether there is a need to uplink 
data, powering up the transmitter and transmitting a data 
frame if appropriate, and returning to sleep.  Whether the
