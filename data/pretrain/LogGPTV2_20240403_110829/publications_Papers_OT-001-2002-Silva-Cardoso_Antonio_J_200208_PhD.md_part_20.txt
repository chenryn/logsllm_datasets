discover Web services during an e-workflow (i.e., a workflow managing traditional tasks
and Web services) composition process and to facilitate their subsequent integration with
the e-workflow host.
202
We present a methodology and a set of algorithms for Web service discovery based
on three dimensions: syntax, operational metrics, and semantics. This approach allows for
Web service discovery not only based on functional requirements, but also on operational
metrics.
The need to discover workflow components based on operational metrics has a
greater importance when Web services are involved, as compared to workflow tasks. The
autonomy of Web services does not allow for users to identify their operational metrics at
design time, i.e., before their actual execution. The development of mechanisms for the
discovery of Web services based on operational metrics allows organizations to translate
their vision into their business processes more efficiently, since -eworkflows can be
designed according to QoS requirements, goals, and objectives.
To facilitate the discovery and posteriori integration of Web service into workflows
we propose an approach based on the use of ontologies to describe workflow tasks and
Web service interfaces. Ontology-based approaches have already proved to be an
important solution to information integration in order to achieve interoperability. During
an e-workflow composition, there is a loss of semantics associated with Web service task
interfaces because a large part of the domain knowledge a developer employs when
deploying a Web service is not present at composition time.
In our work we have devised an algorithm and implemented a prototype to discover
and facilitate the resolution of structural and semantic differences during the integration
process with an e-workflow. The algorithm uses a feature-based model to find similarities
across workflow tasks and Web service interfaces. The system determines and evaluates
the best mapping between the outputs and inputs of a SO and the workflow host that
yields the highest degree of integration.

APPENDIX A
THE DNA SEQUENCING WORKFLOW
A.1 INTRODUCTION
The life sciences research laboratory at the University of Georgia specializes in
genomics, a discipline that investigates biological problems by examining entire
genomes, or a large number of genes, at one time. Genomic projects involve highly
specialized researchers and laboratory personnel, sophisticated equipment, and an intense
generation and computation of data. The characteristics of the human and technological
resources involved are often geographically distributed; they require a sophisticated
coordination infrastructure to manage not only laboratory personnel and equipment, but
also the flow of data generated.
The research laboratory has realized that to be competitive and efficient it must adopt
a new and modern information systems infrastructure. A first step was taken in that
direction with the adoption a workflow management system to support its laboratory
processes. The adoption of a workflow system has enabled the logic of traditional
laboratory processes to be captured in a workflow schema. In the context of our research
on quality of service, we have developed a workflow application to manage the DNA
sequencing process. This workflow has been used to study, validate, and demonstrate the
applicability of our QoS model.
In the next sections, we give a brief introduction to genomics and describe the DNA
sequencing workflow application we have developed.

A.2 INTRODUCTION TO GENOMICS
A genome represents a complete set of instructions for making an organism. It is a
detailed map that contains the master blueprint for a cell or an organism. Packed into
nearly every body cell there is a complete copy of the human genome,i .e., all the genes
that make up the master blueprint for building a living human .
A cell or organism is composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein
molecules, which are organized into structures called chromosomes (Figure A-1). The
DNA is a double-stranded linear chain of nucleotide bases from the set composed of
adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine (or A, T, C, G, respectively). The nucleotides
can be thought of as an alphabet, as their sequence along the DNA strand encodes
instructions for building proteins.
Figure A-1 – Chromosome, DNA, and Genes.
Nucleotide base pares are organized into units called chromosomes. All genes are
arranged linearly along the chromosomes and contain roughly equal parts of protein and
DNA. The DNA molecules are among the largest molecules known.
A gene is a specific sequence of nucleotide bases whose sequence carries the
information required for constructing a single protein. Proteins provide structure to cells,
tissues, and enzymes, which catalyze all of the cellular biochemicale ractions.
205
A major task in genomics is determining the DNA sequence of a genomic region
(Hall, Miller et al. 2000). The first draft of the entire sequence of the human genome has
been recently reported (Lemonick 2002). The next step in genomics is in determining
how individuals differ from one another at the genetic level. Genetic differences between
individuals underlie differences in susceptibility to most diseases and in the response to
drug therapy.
A.3 DNA SEQUENCING WORKFLOW DESCRIPTION
The DNA Sequencing workflow manages a set of tasks to carry out particular activities
necessary to sequence DNA. The workflow is responsible for: managing the preparation
of a sample, cloning, sequencing, assembly, sequence processing, and processing the
results obtained. A graphic representation of the workflow is illustrated inF igure A-2.
Figure A-2 – The DNA Sequencing workflow.
206
In the next section, we describe the main tasks that compose the DNA Sequencing
workflow.
A.3.1 SETUP AND PREPARE SAMPLE
The setup task is relatively simple; its objective is to initialize general information
describing the samples being sequenced.
The prepare sample task consists of isolating DNA from a biological sample. The
samples can be prepared using a variety of protocols, which when carried out rigorously
will ensure DNA that is of high quality. A high quality DNA sample will yield more
accurate sequencing results. The quality of the DNA sample or template is one of the
most critical factors in DNA sequencing.
This task is accomplished using the “shotgun” or random sequencing approach
method. This entails cloning small genomic DNA fragments into a series of plasmid
clones. Shotgun sequencing has the advantage that it requires no prior knowledge of the
DNA sequence and puts no limitations on the size of the DNA to be sub-cloned. In
shotgun sequencing, the target DNA is fragmented by enzymatic digestion or by shearing
it into a large number of fragments, from a few hundred to a few thousand nucleotide
pairs. Each piece is then inserted into bacteria to establish clones .
In this technique, the DNA of specific genes is removed from the desired sequences
and placed into bacteria. Once a specific sequence of DNA has been isolated and placed
into the bacteria, it is allowed to replicate itself, producing millions of clones that contain
the DNA sequenced being used for the research project. When the bacteria replicate, they
also replicate the gene. When the desired number of clones is obtained, the bacteria is
separated from the inserted piece of DNA understudy. The colonies that grow are ones
that contain the DNA that will be used later to translate the protein.
The task prepare sample is composed of 16 individual, manual steps executed
sequentially. We give a brief description of each step:
207
Inoculate (1). The step inoculate consists of growing a culture of 20-ml LB tubes in 50-
ml conical tubes and letting them shake overnight .
Miniprep. The step miniprep takes the inoculated culture, and using an enzyme, removes
any genomic contamination (e.g. E. coli).
Inoculate (2). This second inoculation grows a culture of 500 m l of a 20-ml LB tube and
inoculates 250 ml of LB that will shake overnight .
Maxiprep. The step maxiprep takes the inoculated culture, and using an enzyme, removes
any genomic contamination (e.g. E. coli), as well as any bacterial cells which were
required to grow the cDNA.
Nebulize DNA. In this step, a nebulizer containing buffered DNA solution and glycerol is
placed in an ice-water bath and subjected to argon gas at a pressure of 8 psi for 2.5
minutes. The pressure induces the fragmentation of the DNA.
Ethanol Precipitation. An ethanol precipitation is carried out to clean up the DNA.
End Repair Nebulized DNA. Since nebulized DNA fragments usually contain single-
stranded ends, the samples need to be repaired prior to ligation.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis. In this step, the DNA samples are placed on a gel that is
subjected to electrophoresis. The fragments in each sample are allowed to migrate to
separate, adjacent lanes in the gel. The pieces of DNA in each lane become separated by
size, the smaller pieces traveling farther in the gel than the larger ones. The separation of
the pieces in the lanes is then visualized by long wave UV light and pohtographed with a
computerized system; this reveals the distance traveled by the pieces in each lane.
208
Cut Out Bands. The gel bands of interest are excised with a sterile razor blade. The sizes
of the bands of interest are in the 1-2 kb and 2-4 kb size range.
Purify DNA from Gel Fragments. In this step, the gel fragments are purified with a High
Pure PCR kit by means of column centrifugation, and the “freeze and squeeze” method
by ethanol precipitation is carried out.
Ligation. The recipient vector, which usually contains an antibiotic resistance gene, is cut
so that it is ready to receive an insert. Both are joined together to form a recombinant
DNA molecule. DNA ligase seals the breaks between the inserted, end-repaired DNA
fragments and the cloning vector.
Electroporation. The recombinant molecules are introduced into a host, in our case a
bacteria XL-1 blue competent (various types of organisms can be used). The bacteria take
up the DNA by electroporation (i.e., an electric shock).
Ethanol precipitation. The DNA is clean up again by ethanol precipitation .
Put Cells in Plates. In this step, the cells are plated on selective media containing an
antibiotic that will kill any cells that have failed to take up the vector carrying the
antibiotic-resistant gene. Two types of colonies arise. One is the white colony, containing
the insert, and the other is the blue colony, which is missing the insert .
Pick Colonies. Finally, a robot picks 384 colonies from the plates and puts them into two
96-well microtitre plates. The cells will grow overnight in a solution of carbanicillin, LB,
and glycerol.
209
A.3.2 PREPARE CLONES AND SEQUENCE
The sequencing task is composed of three tasks (Figure A-3): prepare clones,
sequencing, and base calling.
Figure A-3 – Prepare Clones and Sequence.
A.3.2.1 PREPARE CLONE
During the realization of this task, specific regions of the genome are isolated from the
materials generated in the previous step. This task is composed of three steps: grow
clones, template purification, and sequence reaction.
Grow Clones. In this step the plates are replicated into deep well plates.
Template Purification. Alkaline lysis and ethanol precipitation are used to purify the cells
in the deep well plates.
210
Sequence Reaction. In this step a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is done on the
cloned DNA. PCR allows the DNA to be selectively amplified from specific sites in
order to isolate specific sequences of DNA which are of interest for further research. The
isolated DNA sequences are inserted into a molecule of bacterial DNA called a plasmid.
When the bacteria replicate, so do the plasmids, thereby replicating the sequence of
interest.
A.3.2.2 SEQUENCING
The task Sequencing consists of loading the deep well plates onto a DNA sequencer in
order to read each biochemical “letter” (A, G, C or T) of a cloned DNA fragment. The
output is composed of decoded segments of 100 to 750 nucleotides in length (e.g.
sequence AGGCATTCCAG.…) The development of instruments for automated DNA
sequencing has dramatically increased the output of individual laboratories. Unlike
manual sequencing methods, which generally use a radioactive label and visualize the
banding pattern by autoradiography, automated sequencers use a scanning laser to detect
DNA fragments labeled with fluorescent dyes. Considerablet ime and labor savings can
be obtained with automated sequencing – through increased capacity, immediate data
acquisition, and automatic data entry. The DNA sequence information is detected and
signals are sent to a computer to be collected by data collection software. This data is
then processed and interpreted by specific analysis software.
A.3.2.3 BASE CALLING
This task processes and interprets the data files (in ABI format) obtained from the
sequencing task. The files are analyzed, peaks are identified, and base calls and
associated quality values are generated. This task uses PHRED (Ewing and Green 1998)
to carry out the base calling.
211
A.3.3 ASSEMBLY
This task is responsible for the assembly of the fragments resulting from thep repare
clones and sequence task. The sequence assembly reconstructs the sequence of a clone
from readings made from shorter DNA fragments which were generated from the clone.
To carry out the assembly the PHRAP application (PHRAP 2002) is used. PHRAP
exhaustively compares all readings against all other in a pairwise fashion r,anking each
potential reading-pair overlap according to its alignment score. Starting with the highest
scoring pair, it then takes each pair in turn and constructs contigs by using a greedy
algorithm.
After the sequence assembly, additional reading and editing is usually required to
raise the accuracy of the sequence to a level that is considered adequate. This process
involves the assembly of additional sequences and the visual inspection of assembly
discrepancies. To this end, the Consed (Gordon, Abajian et al. 1998) application is used.
A.3.4 QUALITY TEST
To improve the quality of the DNA Sequencing workflow, it is advantageous to detect
any contamination that may have occurred to the sequences. Clones grown in bacterial
hosts and managed by humans are likely to have contamination, such ase scherichia coli
(E. coli). A quick and effective way to screen for the E. coli contaminant is to compare a
DNA sequence against its gemone. For E. coli, this task is made easier with the
availability of its full genome; the comparison can be done using the program BLASTN
(Altschul, Gish et al. 1990). The goal of the test quality task is to detect E. coli
contamination after the assembly task.
A.3.5 GET SEQUENCES
Get sequences is a simple task that downloads the sequences created in the assembly step,
using the FTP protocol.
212
A.3.6 SEQUENCE PROCESSING
The goal of the sequence processing task is to identify macromolecules with related
structures and functions in the DNA sequences. Given a new DNA sequence, a scientist
will typically compare the sequence to a repository of known sequences (e.g., Swiss-Prot
or GenBank), using one of a number of computational biology applications for
comparison. This search is used to determine whether a newly-sequenced DNA has
already been published in the literature, and, if not, to give some hint of its putative
function by searching for related sequences. This task is itself composed of two tasks
which identify macromolecules with related structures and functions: theS P BLAST and
SP FASTA tasks.
The SP BLAST task uses the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)
application to provide a method for rapid searching of nucleotide and protein databases.
The application uses heuristic algorithms to identify similar sequences in databases. It
first identifies very short, exact matches between the query sequence and the database
sequences. Subsequently, the best short matches from the previous stage are extended to
see if more similarity can be found. The programs classify each search with a score
reflecting the degree of similarity between the query sequence (“probe”) and the
compared (“subject”) sequence. If the degree of similarity is strong, then the two
sequences may share a homologous relationship, and the new sequence may be assigned
potential biological functions that can be tested in the laboratory or classified into a
functional family.
Other programs, with the same objective as BLAST, include FASTA (FASTA 2002)
and those that implement the Smith-Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman 1981).
The programs perform sequence comparisons which typically generate a series of scores
that estimate the degree of similarity between a subject sequence and a set of target
sequences. The BLAST and FASTA programs also generate an estimate of the
213
probability that the relationship between two sequences could have been observed by
chance. A very low probability indicates that the relationship between two sequences is
highly significant, whereasa relatively high probability suggests that the relationship may
be due to random chance. The SP FASTA task uses the FASTA for sequence
comparisons.
Many of the most interesting relationships between sequences occur in the boundary
zone, where the significance of the relationship between two sequences is not clearly
resolved by a particular algorithm. To resolve this situation, the comparisons can be
defined as a series of similarity tests, using several different algorithms and several
parameterizations from each – from fast heuristic methods such as BLAST, to slower,
more rigorous methods such as Smith-Waterman.
A.3.6.1 PROCESS RESULTS
After obtaining the data from the sequence processing task, the results are processed. The
results are stored, e-mailed, and a report is created (Figure A-4).
Figure A-4 – Process Results.
214
The store results task stores the data generated by the previous task in a database. As
the name indicates, e-mail results is responsible for electronically mailing the sequencing
results to the persons concerning with this process, such as researchers and laboratory
technicians. The create report task creates a technical report containing formatted
information which describes the results obtained. Finally, thes tore report task stores the
report in a persistent storage site.
