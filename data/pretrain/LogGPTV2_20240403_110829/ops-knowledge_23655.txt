User: I am using IDLE 3 in windows . My question is simply , is there any way we can get the last thing entered by pressing the up arrow key ( like in case of ipython ) .
It is very problematic to copy the last command and again to paste it !
Assistant: Check IDLE key preferences. For Mac it is CTRL+P. look for history-previous key mapping
