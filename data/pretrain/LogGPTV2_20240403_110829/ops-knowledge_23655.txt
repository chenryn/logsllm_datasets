**User:**
I am using IDLE 3 on Windows. My question is, is there a way to recall the last command by pressing the up arrow key, similar to how it works in IPython? It is quite inconvenient to have to copy and paste the last command every time.

**Assistant:**
To recall the last command in IDLE, you can check the key preferences. For Mac, the default key binding for navigating through command history is `Ctrl + P`. On Windows, you should look for the "history-previous" key mapping in the IDLE preferences to find the appropriate key combination.
