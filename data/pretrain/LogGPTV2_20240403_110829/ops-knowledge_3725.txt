User: I am trying to import the OpenGL.GL module.
Given the py file with that line, I can perform "python file.py" just fine, but I cannot run that same file when used in Aptana or Eclipse. Both IDEs have PyDev installed.
I do have PyOpenGL installed.
I wish to point out that I can still import other modules (PIL, numpy), which were installed the same way as the PyOpenGL. I am confident that there is only 1 python running on my MacOS.
Assistant: Are you sure you don't have multiple versions of python? Seems to me like the interpreter that aptana uses is not the same as the one used from command line. You can look in:
Run -> Run configurations -> Python run -- then you have Interpreter tab
There you can click : See resulting command line. Than will get you the python that is used as well as the python path
