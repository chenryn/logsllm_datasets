### A Strict Signature Matching Based Tool

- **Functionality**: This tool searches for a 100% match between the received results and the tool’s signature database.
- **Match Criteria**: If a 100% match is not found, no results are returned.
- **Sensitivity**: The tool is highly sensitive to environmental factors affecting the probed target and the network on which the target resides.

---

### Statistical-Based Algorithms (Best Match)

- **Resistance to Environmental Factors**: Using statistical-based algorithms, the tool provides better resistance against environmental effects that may impact the target system and probe packets.
- **Impact of Fingerprinting Tests**: Some fingerprinting tests have a greater impact on the overall accuracy of the test results. Their failure may or may not affect the ability to provide granular results (i.e., not grouped).
- **Remark**: Xprobe2 was the first open-source tool to implement a statistical analysis-based mathematical algorithm (‘fuzzy logic’) to provide the best effort match between probe results and a signature database.

---

### The Use of a Fixed Number of Fingerprinting Tests

- **Fixed Parameters**: A fixed number of fingerprinting tests and parameters are examined.
- **Theoretical Matches**: Possible matches = the number of tests × number of parameters examined × parameter permutations.
- **Limitations**: Although the number of possible matches is currently much higher than the number of available network elements, certain test classes cannot deliver the expected results to clearly distinguish between different operating systems.

---

### Enhanced Fingerprinting Tests

- **Requirement**: A better tool for active OS fingerprinting would need to utilize tests that examine many parameter values in a probe's reply.
- **Parameter Variability**: These parameter values should differ among various TCP/IP stack implementations.
- **Broader Distinction**: Multiple such tests are needed to achieve a broader distinction between different TCP/IP stack implementations.
- **Conclusion**: Using more parameter-rich fingerprinting tests with an active OS fingerprinting tool will provide better overall results. The tool must also support new fingerprinting methods as they are published.

---

### Impact of Fingerprinting Tests on Overall Results

- **Significant Impact**: Some fingerprinting tests have a larger impact on the overall accuracy of the test results compared to others.
- **Consequences of Failure**: If these critical tests fail, the quality of the produced results will be significantly reduced.

---

### No Changes to TCP/IP Stacks in New OS Versions

- **Behavior Consistency**: The behavior of the TCP/IP stack in newly released operating systems rarely changes compared to older versions of the same OS.
- **Limited Changes**: Any changes made to a newly released OS’s TCP/IP stack might only affect a specific protocol behavior.
- **Result**: Some active OS fingerprinting tools that rely on a certain fingerprinting niche may struggle to distinguish between different versions of the same OS or even between different classes within the same OS family.

---

### Inability to Determine the Exact Windows OS Service Pack

- **Traditional Tools**: Traditional active OS fingerprinting tools usually cannot identify the installation of software service packs on a targeted machine.
- **Example**: These tools can identify that a machine runs Microsoft Windows 2000 but cannot determine which service pack version is installed (if any).

---

### Inability to Identify the Underlying Architecture Platform

- **OS Identification**: Active OS fingerprinting tools typically identify the operating system of a network node but not its underlying platform.
- **Importance**: Knowledge of the underlying platform is crucial for tools performing vulnerability assessments, network inventory, etc., which rely on the results of the active OS fingerprinting tool (e.g., Nessus).

---

### Inability to Scale

- **Scalability Requirement**: An active OS fingerprinting tool should be able to scan large networks without using too many packets.
- **Network Limitations**: Routers and switches have an upper limit to the number of packets per second they can process. Exceeding this limit can lead to packet loss and potential denial of service conditions.
- **Balancing Scan Rate**: It is essential to balance the scan rate with the network and network element capabilities.

---

### Inability to Control Fingerprinting Modules

- **Test Relevance**: When scanning different machines on different topologies, some tests may be useless.
- **Control for Accuracy**: Controlling which tests to use can result in better accuracy and a lower chance of detection.
- **Customization**: Users need to control the fingerprinting tests according to their needs.
- **Adaptive Scanning**: An active OS fingerprinting tool should be able to detect certain scanning conditions and adjust its tactics accordingly.

---

### Weaknesses - Summary

- **Scanning Conditions**: The OS fingerprinting methods used by a remote active OS fingerprinting tool require specific conditions to produce a successful identification of the underlying OS.
- **Terrain Limitations**: Some conditions cannot be met in certain scanning terrains, such as a web server behind a well-fortified firewall.
- **Degraded Accuracy**: If critical OS fingerprinting tests fail, the tool's accuracy will be degraded, especially if the failed tests have a significant impact on the results.
- **Granularity Issues**: Currently used TCP/IP-based OS fingerprinting tests are not granular enough, particularly for Microsoft Windows-based OSs.

---

### Other Approaches and Their Limitations

- **Alternative Methods**: Some researchers suggest using specific OS fingerprinting niches to identify the underlying OS of remote machines under Internet conditions.
- **TCP Port Examination**: These tests use an opened TCP port and examine the TCP stack implementation of the remote machine.
- **Data Exchange**: Some tests require specific data exchange and a large number of packets.
- **Main Problem**: This approach is suitable for identifying OS families but not exact OS versions.
- **Comparison**: Some other tests available in open-source tools produce similar quality results with a single packet.

---

### The Needed Solution

- **Intelligent Scanning**: The tool must introduce intelligence in scanning and understand the terrain it operates in.
- **Result Quality**: The tool must evaluate the quality of the results received.
- **Additional Tests**: More tests need to be evaluated to find significant OS fingerprinting tests.
- **Integration**: There should be an integration between stack-based OS fingerprinting tests and application-layer based fingerprinting tests tailored to the services found on the target system.
