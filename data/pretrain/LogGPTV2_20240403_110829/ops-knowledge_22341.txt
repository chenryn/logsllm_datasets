User: How to consider scalability and reliability in system architecture design? Please provide architectural principles and best practices.
Assistant: 1. Architecture principles (1) High cohesion and loose coupling High cohesion means that the elements inside a module are highly related. The higher the cohesion, the better the stability of the module. Loose coupling means that the modules cooperate with each other, and the dependencies are simple and clear. A loosely coupled system is easy to extend and modify. (2) Hierarchical structure The system is divided into several levels according to the function, and the modules with the same function are grouped in the same level, so as to realize mutual isolation and mutual calling between each level. (3) Modular design splits a system into multiple modules to facilitate operations such as unit testing, integration testing, and troubleshooting. At the same time, the modular design can realize efficient reconstruction and expansion of the entire system. (4) Asynchronous communication Asynchronous communication can play an important role in improving the responsiveness and scalability of the system. Tasks will be assigned to different threads, services or servers according to the asynchronous mechanism, and these threads, services or servers will be processed in an asynchronous manner. 2. Best practice (1) Horizontal and vertical expansion Horizontal expansion is to increase the number of servers in the system, while vertical expansion is to increase the resources of each server. In the system architecture design, the horizontal and vertical expansion should be reasonably selected according to the needs to meet the scalability requirements of the system. (2) Asynchronous non-blocking I/O I/O is the most common operation in a network service. Under high concurrent access, it will cause thread blocking, making the system respond slowly, thus affecting the stability and scalability of the system. Asynchronous non-blocking I/O can improve the concurrent performance of the system and improve the scalability of the system. (3) Distributed cache Distributed cache can cache commonly used data in the memory, thereby reducing the access pressure of the database and improving the performance and scalability of the system. (4) Elastic architecture The elastic architecture can enable the system to automatically expand, recover, and adjust, etc., to ensure the availability and performance of the system. It should be applied to the system architecture design as much as possible, which is also the best choice to ensure the long-term availability and scalability of the system.
