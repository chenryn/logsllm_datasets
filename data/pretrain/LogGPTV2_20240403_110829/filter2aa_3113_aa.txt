Abstract 
The Internet is constantly growing, providing a myriad of new services, both legitimate and malicious. Criminals take 
advantage of the scalable, distributed, and rather easily accessible naming, hosting and routing infrastructures of the 
Internet. As a result, the battle against malware is raging on multiple fronts: the endpoint, the network perimeter, and 
the application layer. The need for innovative measures to gain ground against the enemy has never been greater. 
In this paper, we present novel strategies to catch malware at the DNS and IP level, as well as our unique 3D 
visualization engine. We will describe the detection systems we built, and share several successful war stories about 
hunting down malware domains and associated rogue IP space. 
At the DNS level, we describe efficient methods for tracking fast flux botnets and describe a study we carried for 
several months of the Zeus fast flux proxy network. At the IP level, classical reputation methods assign 
"maliciousness" scores to IPs, BGP prefixes, or ASNs by merely counting domains and IPs. Our system takes an 
unconventional approach that combines two opposite, yet complementary views and leads to more effective 
predictive detections. 
On one hand, we abstract away from the ASN view. We build the AS graph and investigate its topology to uncover 
hotspots of malicious or suspicious activities and monitor our DNS traffic for new domains hosted on these malicious 
IP ranges. We will also describe a unique method of identifying seemingly autonomous networks that are actually 
operated by one organization, which helps further identify potentially malicious areas of the Internet. On the other 
hand, we examine a granularity finer than the BGP prefix. For this, we zero in on IP ranges re-allocated or re-
assigned to bad customers within large prefixes to host Exploit kit domains, browlock, and other attack types. 
We will present various techniques we devised to efficiently discover suspicious reserved ranges and sweep en 
masse for candidate suspicious IPs. Our system provides actionable intelligence and preemptively detects and 
blocks malicious IP infrastructures prior to, or immediately after some of them are used to wage malware campaigns, 
therefore decisively closing the detection gap. 
The discussion of these detection systems and "war stories" wouldn't be complete without a visualization engine that 
adequately displays the use cases and offers a graph navigation and investigation tool. Therefore, in this paper, we 
will also discuss our own 3D visualization engine, demonstrating the full process which transforms raw data into 
stunning 3D visuals. We will also present different techniques used to build and render large graph datasets: Force 
Directed algorithms accelerated on the GPU using OpenCL, 3D rendering and navigation using OpenGL ES, and 
GLSL Shaders.

Part 1: Catching Malware DNS-style 
In today’s cybercrime world, bad actors strive to keep their operations (spam, phishing, malware distribution, botnets, 
etc.) online at all times, and for that the hosting network infrastructure plays a crucial role. The domain name system 
(DNS) and IP hosting infrastructures are the foundations of the Internet, and they are equally used for legitimate and 
criminal activities alike. 
Botnets as proxy networks 
Botnets constitute a notable hosting and attack delivery infrastructure. As it is composed of a large collection of 
compromised machines that receive instructions from a command & control server, a botnet can be quite versatile. 
The bots can perform numerous malicious activities on demand, and therefore represent an all-purpose weapon for 
criminals.  
A prominent use of botnets is as proxy networks to shield the identity and location of malware CnCs during the 
communication between an infected host and the CnC. In this case, the proxy network can take the form of a fast flux 
service network [1]. Fast-flux service networks take advantage of DNS to redirect C&C connection attempts to a set 
of proxy nodes that are constantly shifting. These proxy nodes serve as intermediaries to relay information between 
infected hosts and the C&C component. A fast-flux service network is created by setting up a selection of domains to 
resolve to the IP addresses of a subset of available proxy nodes (bots). These IP addresses are then frequently 
changed to the IP addresses of new proxy nodes which is known as IP fluxing. This way, the proxy network provides 
an extra layer of evasion and protection for the actual malware CnCs. The communication between the infected hosts 
always goes through the fast flux proxy network to reach the malware backend CnCs. 
In general, botnet-based proxy networks can be used to serve malware pushed from CnCs down to newly infected 
hosts via Exploit kit attacks or spam attachments, or to push new payloads to already infected hosts, or to forward 
communication from infected clients to backend CnCs like in the case of Kelihos (fast flux botnet with TTL=0) and 
Zbot (fast flux botnet with a TTL=150). In this part, we will discuss a several months study we conducted on the Zbot 
proxy network. This network consists of a few tens of thousands of infected machines and has hosted over a 
thousand CnC domains. It has hosted CnCs for various malware families: Zeus variants, Asprox, and most recently 
the new Zeus GameOver variant. 
Zeus Crimeware 
The Zeus Crimeware kit is one of the most advanced toolkits used to generate effective and versatile malware 
payloads that facilitate criminal activities. The kit consists of the following main components: a control panel, config 
files (which hold the URLs for drop zones, extra payload, extra configs, and target websites of web injects), binary 
files, and a builder. The crimeware’s main goals are to steal financial data such as online bank account and credit 
card information, steal sensitive credentials, and perform web injects to hijack the victims’ sessions on websites of 
interest to the criminals (e.g. online banking websites). 
Zeus CnCs 
Zeus command and control domains can be hosted on different platforms: compromised sites, fast flux botnets, or 
bulletproof or free hosting providers [3]. Additionally, Zeus CnC domains can be used for three types of purposes: 
they can serve configuration files, binary files, or serve as drop zones. 
In this study, we focus on the fast flux botnet that hosts Zeus CnC domains and which we call the “zbot proxy 
network”. This proxy network hosts fast flux domains with a characteristic TTL of 150 seconds and is constituted of a 
few thousand infected machines. We use two methods to detect the fast flux domains hosted on this network: 
periodic Hadoop Pig jobs, and IP harvesting combined with filtering heuristics applied on our streaming authoritative 
DNS traffic.  
3 
For the first method, we run a periodic Pig job on our authoritative logs stored on HDFS where we retrieve domains 
with a TTL<=150. We filter out unwanted domains such as spam or legitimate domains, then build the bipartite graph 
of domains-IPs, and take the largest connected component. This heuristic extracts the zbot fast flux domains along 
with their resolving IPs from the portion of logs we processed. The IPs are appended to the pool of zbot IPs that is 
also used in the second method. 
For the second method, we incrementally build the list of confirmed zbot fast flux domains, continuously resolve them, 
and append the IPs to the pool of zbot IPs. At the same time, we tap into our streaming authoritative DNS traffic and 
extract any domain whose IP or name server IP is in the zbot IP pool. 
The combination of these two methods allows us to catch the bulk of new zbot fast flux domains that we see in our 
traffic. Using the authoritative DNS stream is faster than a DNSDB stored on Hadoop, as the traffic is coming live 
from a selection of our resolvers at a rate of hundreds to thousands of entries per second. A typical entry looks like: 
ASN, domain, 2LD, IP, NS_IP, timestamp, TTL, type. 
Zbot proxy network usage 
We recorded different uses of the fast flux domains riding on the zbot proxy network. One recorded use is as Zeus 
CnCs after infection via Magnitude EK. A second recorded use is as Kuluoz CnCs post-infection by different Exploit 
kits. In this case, various Exploit kits or malicious attachments lead to the dropping of the Kuluoz/Dofoil malware. The 
infected host becomes part of the Asprox botnet and phones to one or several of the fast flux domains. 
Figure 1. Infection vectors followed by beaconing to fast flux proxy networks. 
In the figure above, we show the different documented scenarios of Exploit kit attacks or malicious attachments 
leading to beaconing to generic zbot CnCs, Asprox CnCs, or Kelihos CnCs. These scenarios are differentiated with 
ET signatures. There are two main infection vectors: Exploit kit attacks via drive-by downloads or spam emails with 
embedded links leading to malware, or the malware dropper coming as attachment (fake Flash update) [4].

HTTP Traffic URL Patterns 
Following the detection of the fast flux CnC domains using our described methods, we investigate the HTTP traffic 
directed to these domains by temporarily sinkholing them and checking VirusTotal and Zeustracker.abuse.ch 
databases. We notice that these domains are very versatile. Various malware families use them as CnCs: Zeus and 
three of its variants (Citadel, KINS, ICE IX) as well as Asprox and some other downloaders. They also served to host 
phishing sites and we recorded domains hosting Pony panels. This confirms the nature of the zbot fast flux botnet as 
a “service network” utilized for various purposes depending on clients’ needs. In the sections below, we show the 
detailed url patterns for the different categories of usage of the CnC domains. 
Zeus CnC traffic 
A Zeus CnC can serve 3 types of URLs: Config, Binary, or drop zone [3]. In the Table below, we show examples of 
Zeus CnC URLs that were recorded in traffic.
