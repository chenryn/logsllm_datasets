User: Is there a difference in python programming while using just python and while using pypy compiler? I wanted to try using pypy so that my program execution time becomes faster. Does all the syntax that work in python works in pypy too? If there is no difference, can you tell me how can i install pypy on debian lunux and some usage examples on pypy? Google does not contain much info on pypy other than its description.
Assistant: pypy is a compliant alternative implementation of the python language. This means that there are few (intentional) differences. One of the few differences is pypy does not use reference counting. This means, for instance, you have to manually close your files, they will not be automatically closed when your file variable goes out of scope as in CPython.
