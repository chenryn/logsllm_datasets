ABSTRACT 
Physical  Unclonable  Function  (PUF)  is  a  promising  hardware 
security primitive with broad application prospect. However, the 
strong PUF with numerous Challenge and Response Pairs (CRPs), 
e.g. the arbiter PUF, is vulnerable to modeling attacks. There are 
two  major  kinds  of  countermeasures.  One  is  restricting  CRP 
access  interface,  such  as  controlled  PUF  and  XOR  arbiter  PUF, 
which  unfortunately  has  been  broken  with  the  help  of  side-
channels.  The  other  is  using  non-linear  electronic  characteristics 
to produce CRPs, such as the current mirror PUF and the voltage 
transfer PUF. They are only proved to be resistant to SVM based 
attack, while no more analysis is further explored so far. In this 
paper, we propose an attack method based on compound heuristic 
algorithms  of  evolution  strategy,  simulated  annealing,  and  ant 
colony to efficiently attack these two non-linear PUFs. This paper 
reveals that current mirror and voltage transfer are still not able to 
help strong PUF resist attacks. Our experimental results show that 
the average CRP prediction accuracy is as high as 99%.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The  Physical  Unclonable  Function  (PUF)  is  a  promising 
hardware  security  primitive  [1].  It  exploits  the  random  physical 
disorder  and  the  process  variation  to  output  particular  responses 
for  input  challenges,  which  are  called  the  Challenge-Response 
Pairs  (CRPs).  The  PUF  has  broad  application  prospects  in  the 
field of hardware security, such as authentication, key-exchange, 
IP protection, and hardware obfuscation. 
PUF can be divided into two major categories: (1) the weak PUF 
with a few number of CRPs, such as the coating PUF [2] and the 
SRAM PUF [3]; (2) the strong PUF with a large number of CRPs. 
The  arbiter  PUF  [4][5]  is  a  typical  strong  PUF.  It  compares  the 
delays of two paths to produce a response. Each path is consisted 
of path segments which are selected by a challenge. As the delays 
of  path  segments  are  affected  by  process  variation,  the  CRPs 
cannot be predicted before manufacturing.

However, to break the arbiter PUF, attackers model the delay of 
each path as the sum delay of path segments [6]. When attackers 
collect  certain  number  of  CRPs,  they  can  use  machine  learning 
algorithms to speculate the delays of path segments, so that all the 
unknown CRPs can be predicted. It takes only several minutes to 
achieve 99.9% CRP prediction accuracy. 
To  resist  modeling  attacks,  there  are  two  major  kinds  of 
countermeasures. One is restricting CRP access interface by using 
hash function [7] or XOR gates [8]. In this way, attackers cannot 
directly access the original responses. Unfortunately, the work in 
[9] adopts the unreliability side-channel to build a new model for 
attack. The power [10] and the photon [11] are also successfully 
used to imply or expose the original responses. 
The other countermeasure is using other electronic characteristics 
than  delay  to  produce  CRPs.  Two  recent  typical  PUFs  are  the 
current mirror PUF [12] and the voltage transfer PUF [13]. It is 
claimed that both of them can resist SVM based attack. However, 
seldom  analysis  of  their  security  is  further  explored  so  far  [16]. 
Can these electronic characteristics really resist attacks? 
To answer this question, we propose an attack method toward the 
current  mirror  PUF  and 
transfer  PUF.  Our 
contributions include: 
(1) An attack method based on compound heuristic algorithms of 
evolution  strategy,  simulated  annealing,  and  ant  colony  is 
proposed; 
(2) This paper reveals that current mirror and voltage transfer non-
linear PUFs are still not able to resist attacks. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews 
the  two  non-linear  PUFs.  Section 3  proposes  the  attack  method. 
Section 4 presents experimental results. Final is the conclusion. 
2.  NON-LINEAR PUF 
The current mirror PUF and the voltage transfer PUF are shown in 
Fig.1  [12][13].  The  current  mirror  (voltage  transfer)  PUF 
propagates  currents  (voltages)  through  two  paths  to  the  arbiter, 
and the arbiter compares the two currents (voltages) to produce a 
response. The challenge determines whether the currents (voltages) 
pass or switch along the paths as shown in Fig.1.

Simulated instance set SI: NI instances; 
Select  2×NC+2  instances  from  the  SI,  and  put  them  at 
appropriate positions (A0~An, B0~Bn in Fig.1) to form a 
Fitting PUF (FPUF); 
As shown in Fig.1, since the input-output characteristic Iin-Iout of 
current mirror and Vin-Vout of voltage transfer are both non-linear, 
they are claimed in [12][13] with higher resistance to SVM based 
attack.  Due  to  process  variation,  different  instances  of  current 
mirror  and  voltage 
input-output 
characteristics to guarantee the PUF uniformity and uniqueness. 
3.  ATTACK ON NON-LINEAR PUF 
3.1  Problem Formulation 
According  to  Fig.1,  to  attack  a  non-linear  PUF  with  NC-bit 
challenge, the key is to speculate the input-output characteristic of 
each current mirror instance or voltage transfer instance. There are 
totally  2×NC+2  instances  in  one  PUF.  Instead  of  directly 
formulating  the  input-output  characteristic,  which  needs  high 
computation  complexity,  we  simulate  NI=105  current  mirror 
instances  and  NI  voltage  transfer  instances  with  random  process 
variations. For the sake of simplicity, in the following, "instance" 
means the current mirror instance or the voltage transfer instance. 
Then, to attack a target PUF, the problem is formulated as: 
Given:  Training set ST: NT known CRPs of the target PUF; 
Task: 
Object:  Among  the  ST,  make  the  target  PUF  and  the  FPUF 
have the same CRPs as many as possible. 
3.2  Compound Heuristic Algorithm 
Many  algorithms  such  as  SVM,  logistic  regression,  evolution 
strategy have been adopted to attack PUFs [6]. Evolution strategy 
is a common algorithm for handling linear or non-linear problems. 
We find that the evolution strategy can attack current mirror PUF 
and voltage transfer PUF, but with a low efficiency. Therefore, we 
introduce the simulated annealing process and the pheromone of 
ant  colony  algorithm  into  the  evolution  strategy,  and  propose  a 
compound heuristic algorithm to attack the two non-linear PUFs. 
The pseudo code is given in Alg.1. The fitness of a FPUF means 
the  percentage  of  same  CRPs  between  the  target  PUF  and  the 
FPUF among ST. 
At Line 1~5 of Alg.1, FT, NE, NS, NF, and NO are five user-defined 
parameters. At Line 6, (2×NC+2) instances are randomly selected 
from SI to form a FPUF. Totally, NF FPUFs are initialized. The 
evolution  of  FPUFs  happens  through  Line  8~32.  During  the 
evolution,  for  each  FPUF,  the  simulated  annealing  algorithm 
combined with the pheromone of ant colony algorithm is used to 
mutant  the  FPUF  at  Line  9-27.  After  NS  iterations  of  simulated 
annealing, at Line 29, only NF-NO FPUFs with higher fitness than 
others are kept, and rest FPUFs are deleted. Then at Line 30, the 
kept  FPUFs  are  crossed  to  generate  NO  new  FPUFs.  In  the 
crossing process, two FPUFs (A1,0~A1,n, B1,0~B1,n) and (A2,0~A2,n, 
B2,0~B2,n)  are  randomly  selected  from  the  kept  FPUFs.  One 
position  o∈[0,  n]  is  also  randomly  selected,  and  then  the  new 
FPUF is (A1,0~A1,o, A2,o+1~A2,n,  B1,0~B1,o, B2,o+1~B2,n). The whole 
procedure ends if the highest fitness of the FPUFs achieves FT at 
Line 31. 
Pheromone  plays  an  important  role  in  the  ant  colony  algorithm. 
The  previous  iterations  guide  the  operations  of  latter  iterations 
through  the  pheromone.  The  pheromone  is  introduced  in  our 
simulated annealing algorithm at Line 10-27. In each iteration of 
simulated annealing, the instance at P is replaced by a randomly 
selected  instance  from  SI.  The  P  is  selected  from  A0~An,  B0~Bn

according  to  its  pheromone.  A  position  with  higher  pheromone 
has  higher  probability  to  be  selected.  If  the  replacement  makes 
FPUF obtain higher fitness, this replacement is accepted, and the 
pheromone  of  P  is  increased.  If  not,  this  replacement  is  only 
accepted  with  certain  probability,  and  the  pheromone  of  P  is 
decreased.  Please  notice  that,  in  one  iteration,  more  than  one 
instance can also be replaced simultaneously. 
4.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In our experiments, we use the proposed method to attack current 
mirror PUFs and voltage transfer PUFs. The proposed method is 
implemented in C++, and is run in desktop computers with Intel 
i7 3.6GHz CPU. As [12], the PUFs are simulated in a 32nm PTM 
model [14], assuming threshold voltage variations obey Gaussian 
distribution  with  3σ  deviation  90mV  [15].  100  current  mirror 
PUFs and 100 voltage transfer PUFs are simulated and attacked. 
Certain number of CRPs is randomly selected. Some of them are
