(208.65.152.0/22), traﬃc to the YouTube servers on
the /24 address block was hijacked to AS17557, due to
the longest preﬁx match algorithm used on the Inter-
net for packet forwarding. Note that, as believed the
original intention of Pakistan Telecom was to block the
YouTube traﬃc within Pakistan; however, due to con-
ﬁguration errors this announcement was released onto
the Internet, and aﬀected the global access of YouTube.
Because of the high popularity of YouTube (especially
among young kids), the YouTube incident is considered
as a notoriously bad example of preﬁx hijacking attacks,
although it only involved a single network preﬁx. This
incident showed to the broader community the weak se-
curity of BGP and what can be exploited to impact the
normal operation of other networks.
We ﬁrst examine the large-scale AS9121 preﬁx hijack-
ing attack. Table 1 shows the number of total BGP an-
nouncements and ﬂagged announcements by the country-
level RBF and RIR-level RBF on 12/23/2004 (before
the AS9121 incident) and 12/24/2004 (during the inci-
dent). From the table we see that on 12/23/2004, before
the incident, the observations are consistent with what
we observed in the previous subsection under the nor-
mal Internet operational conditions. There are about
9% of BGP announcements ﬂagged by the country-level
RBF and 4% by the RIR-level RBF. On 12/24/2005, the
percentages of ﬂagged announcements were increased to
47% and 35%, respectively, for country-level and RIR-
level RBFs. Importantly, Table 2 shows the number of
preﬁxes announced by AS9121, and that ﬂagged by the
country-level and RIR-level RBFs, respectively. From
the table we see that AS9121 announced 55 preﬁxes on
12/23/2004, of which, none was ﬂagged by the country-
level and RIR-level RBFs. On 12/24/2004, AS9121 an-
nounced 105530 network preﬁxes, of which 105151 and
83096 preﬁxes were ﬂagged by country-level and RIR-
level RBFs, respectively.
If country-level (RIR-level)
RBFs have been deployed in an AS, it will ﬁlter out
99.6% (78.7%) of the hijacked routes.
For the YouTube hijacking incident, AS17557 started
to announce the network preﬁx 208.65.153.0/24, be-
longing to YouTube, on 02/24/2008. A country-level
(RIR-level) RBF will successfully detect that the preﬁx
is allocated to US (ARIN region) but the ASN 17557
is allocated to Pakistan (APNIC region). As a con-
sequence, the BGP announcement will be successfully
ﬂagged and the hijacking attack is detected.
From the above examples (and intuitively from the
operations of RBF), we can see that RBF is very eﬀec-
tive in detecting both large-scale and small-scale cross-
region preﬁx hijacking attacks, and conﬁning all poten-
tial hijacking attacks to the same region. This helps

in preﬁx hijacking due to misconﬁguration, and provide
better deterrence to potential intentional preﬁx attacks
because of the explicit legal consequence involved for
hijacking preﬁxes from an AS in the same region.
5. DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In this section we brieﬂy discuss how RBF can be ex-
tended to detect path spooﬁng preﬁx hijacking attacks
(in addition to the origin spooﬁng attacks). We also
brieﬂy summarize the related work.
5.1 Path Spooﬁng Preﬁx Hijacking
So far, we have focused on developing RBF to handle
origin spooﬁng BGP preﬁx hijacking attacks. Here we
brieﬂy discuss how the allocation information may help
dealing with path spooﬁng preﬁx hijacking attacks. As
an example, we can classify network domains into stub
ASes and transit ASes, where transit ASes provide tran-
sit services to others while stub ASes do not. We note
that, stub ASes (and small regional ISPs) are less likely
to suddenly provide transit service to another AS in a
diﬀerent (country or RIR level) regions. RBFs can ﬂag
such new BGP announcements as potential path spoof-
ing preﬁx hijacking attacks. This is in line with the
scheme proposed in [17], which requires two neighbor-
ing ASes to be geographically close. We will conduct a
detailed study on detecting path spooﬁng preﬁx hijack-
ing attacks in our future work.
5.2 Related Work
The work on improving BGP security can be broadly
classiﬁed into two categories, those using cryptography
and those do not. We discuss the ones using cryptogra-
phy ﬁrst. S-BGP [16] is the most comprehensive BGP
security enhancement, which can prevent both types of
BGP preﬁx hijacking attacks. However, S-BGP has not
been widely deployed on the Internet due to the high
management and packet processing cost, and the dif-
ﬁculty in identifying a widely accepted trust authority
on the global Internet. soBGP [30], psBGP [29], and
SPV [11] all tried to reduce the complexity of S-BGP
(and eliminate the requirement of PKI).
Now we discuss the non-cryptography related work.
The most related work is [27], which proposed to detect
preﬁx hijacking attacks based on the ownership infor-
mation of ASNs and IP address preﬁxes. The basic
idea is that the destination preﬁx and the origin AS in
a BGP announcement must belong to the same orga-
nization. However, the proposed scheme relies on the
whois databases to determine if an ASN and preﬁx be-
long to the same organization. The whois databases
contains both the allocation and voluntary registration
information, and the registration information is much
more incomplete and outdated than the allocation in-
formation. The authors proposed a number of heuristics
in examining if an ASN and preﬁx belong to the same
organization, for example, the whois records of the two
have the same organization name, the same contact per-
sonnel, the same email address, the same DNS server,
etc.
In contrast, RBF only uses the numbers alloca-
tion information updated daily by the RIRs. Moreover,
we propose the region-based BGP announcement ﬁlter-
ing architecture as a way to facilitate the diﬀerentiated
treatment of BGP announcements and out-of-band de-
terrence (legal consequence).
In pgBGP [14], a new BGP announcement will be
quarantined for certain amount of time so that hijack-
ing due to misconﬁguration will not be propagated glob-
ally and operators are given longer time to diagnose
the potential cause of the new announcement. Based
on the observation that the association between a pre-
ﬁx and the originating AS and the peering relation-
ship between neighboring ASes are reasonably stable,
a learning-based approach was proposed in [23] to iden-
tify bogus BGP routes. These two schemes only rely
on the control plane BGP routing information to detect
preﬁx hijacking events.
In contrast, RBF utilizes the
AS number and preﬁx allocation information.
A light-weight distributed scheme was proposed in [32],
which detects potential preﬁx hijacking attacks by mon-
itoring data plane network distance changes to the tar-
get preﬁxes from a set of vantage points. The authors
of [10] proposed to detect potential preﬁx hijacking at-
tacks by data plane destination network ﬁngerprinting.
In iSPY [31] each network individually probes a set of
transit ASes to determine its own reachability and infer
if its own preﬁxes have been hijacked. These schemes
use data plane probing to detect potential preﬁx hijack-
ing events. RBF does not require any data plane prob-
ing.
PHAS [18] allows ASes to register their own preﬁxes
and notices the registered ASes when possible hijacks
occur.
In IRV [8], each participating AS v will pub-
lish the preﬁxes announced by the AS (and the BGP
announcement propagation information) in their DNS
servers so that others can query if v has originated a
preﬁx or announced a route to a neighboring AS. The
scheme in [17] detects potential preﬁx hijacking attacks
by exploiting the valley-free property of BGP routes and
the geographical distance.
By correlating spam delivery with BGP announce-
ments, [7] and [24] conﬁrmed that spammers may hi-
jack network preﬁxes to send spam in order to hide their
identities. Hubble [15] is large-scale system to monitor
the reachability problems on the Internet, in particular,
the black holes where BGP routes exist to the corre-
sponding preﬁxes but packets cannot reach the destina-
tions, by periodically probing suspect network preﬁxes.
Although it can be potentially used to detect preﬁx hi-
jacking attacks, it focuses on a diﬀerent problem than
preﬁx hijacking. Campisano et. al. [4] developed a ﬂow
system based model to identify the root cause of indi-
vidual BGP path changes. Similarly, this work does not
directly address the preﬁx hijacking problem.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper we developed a light-weight region-based
BGP announcement ﬁltering scheme (RBF) to improve
the BGP security. In contrast to existing solutions that
indiﬀerently prevent or detect preﬁx hijacking attacks,
RBF enables diﬀerentiated AS and preﬁx ﬁltering treat-
99ment and blends preﬁx hijacking prevention with de-
terrence. Experimental studies based on real Internet
numbers allocation information and BGP traces showed
that RBF is a feasible and eﬀective scheme in improving
BGP security.
