**ATT&CK ID:** T0856  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Spoof Reporting Message

Adversaries may spoof reporting messages in control system environments to evade detection and impair process control. In control systems, reporting messages convey telemetry data, such as input/output (I/O) values, which reflect the current state of equipment and the industrial process. These messages are crucial for monitoring the normal operation of a system and for identifying significant events, such as deviations from expected values. By spoofing these messages, attackers can manipulate the information that operators and automated systems rely on, leading to incorrect decisions and potential disruptions in the industrial process.
