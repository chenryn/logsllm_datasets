  - Specifies the name or IP address of a remote computer. Do not use backslashes. The default is the local computer.
  
- **/u `[<Domain>\]<UserName>`**
  - Runs the command with the account permissions of the specified user. If no domain is provided, the local machine's domain is assumed. The default is the permissions of the currently logged-on user on the computer issuing the command.
  
- **/p `<Password>`**
  - Specifies the password of the user account provided in the `/u` parameter.
  
- **/id `<EntryID>`**
  - Specifies the line number of the operating system entry in the `[operating systems]` section of the `Boot.ini` file that you want to delete. The first line after the `[operating systems]` section header is 1.

**Examples:**

1. To delete the first operating system entry from the `Boot.ini` file on the local computer:
   ```shell
   bootcfg /delete /id 1
   ```

2. To delete the third operating system entry from the `Boot.ini` file on a remote computer named `srvmain`, using the credentials of the user `hiropln` in the `maindom` domain:
   ```shell
   bootcfg /delete /s srvmain /u maindom\hiropln /p p@ssW23 /id 3
   ```

This command can be useful for managing multiple operating system entries and ensuring that only the necessary ones are present in the `Boot.ini` file.
