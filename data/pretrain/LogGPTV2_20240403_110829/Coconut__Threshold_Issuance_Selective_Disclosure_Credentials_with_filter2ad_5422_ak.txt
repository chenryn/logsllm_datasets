D. The Coconut Threshold Credential Scheme
We introduce the Coconut
threshold credential scheme,
allowing users to obtain a partial credential σi on a private
or public attribute m. In a system with n authorities, a t-out-
of-n threshold credentials scheme offers great ﬂexibility as
the users need to collect only n/2 < t ≤ n of these partial
credentials in order to recompute the consolidated credential
(both t and n are scheme parameters).
a) Cryptographic primitives: For the sake of simplicity,
we describe below a key generation algorithm TTPKeyGen
as executed by a trusted third party; this protocol can however
be executed in a distributed way as illustrated by Gennaro et
al. [27] under a synchrony assumption, and as illustrated by
Kate et al. [33] under a weak synchrony assumption. Adding
and removing authorities implies a re-run of the key generation
algorithm—this limitation is inherited from the underlying
Shamir’s secret sharing protocol [48] and can be mitigated
using techniques introduced by Herzberg et al. [29].
