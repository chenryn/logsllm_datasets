### D. The Coconut Threshold Credential Scheme

We introduce the Coconut threshold credential scheme, which enables users to obtain a partial credential \(\sigma_i\) for either a private or public attribute \(m\). In a system with \(n\) authorities, a \(t\)-out-of-\(n\) threshold credential scheme provides significant flexibility. Users need to collect only \(t\) partial credentials, where \(n/2 < t \leq n\), to recompute the consolidated credential. Both \(t\) and \(n\) are parameters of the scheme.

#### Cryptographic Primitives

For simplicity, we describe a key generation algorithm, `TTPKeyGen`, as executed by a trusted third party (TTP). However, this protocol can be executed in a distributed manner, as illustrated by Gennaro et al. [27] under a synchrony assumption, and by Kate et al. [33] under a weak synchrony assumption. Adding or removing authorities requires a re-run of the key generation algorithm, a limitation inherited from the underlying Shamirâ€™s secret sharing protocol [48]. This limitation can be mitigated using techniques introduced by Herzberg et al. [29].

1. **Setup**:
   - **Input**: Security parameter \(\lambda\)
   - **Output**: System parameters `params`
   - **Process**:
     1. Choose a bilinear group \((G_1, G_2, G_T)\) with a \(\lambda\)-bit prime order \(p\).
     2. Let \(g_1, h_1\) be generators of \(G_1\), and \(g_2\) be a generator of \(G_2\).
     3. The system parameters are:
        \[
        \text{params} = (G_1, G_2, G_T, p, g_1, g_2, h_1)
        \]

2. **TTP Key Generation**:
   - **Input**: System parameters `params`, threshold \(t\), number of authorities \(n\)
   - **Output**: Secret keys `sk` and verification keys `vk`
   - **Process**:
     1. Pick two polynomials \(v, w\) of degree \(t-1\) with coefficients in \(\mathbb{F}_p\).
     2. Set \((x, y) = (v(0), w(0))\).
     3. Issue to each authority \(i \in [1, \ldots, n]\):
        - Secret key: \(s_i = (v(i), w(i))\)
        - Verification key: \(v_k = (g_1^{v(i)}, g_2^{w(i)})\)

This setup ensures that the Coconut threshold credential scheme is both flexible and secure, providing a robust framework for managing credentials in a distributed environment.
