User: Im using Python 3.5, my code is as follows:
Given a_sentence the program hangs during the while loop because line_read is "" so it never increments nl_c, therefore never exits the loop, I'm relatively new to using sub processes so I'm not sure where the problem is,  whether it's not being read in correctly or the output.  tl;dr Output from subprocess is "" when it should be an arbitrary string.
Can someone point me in the right direction in getting the line_read = proc.stdout.readline() to be the line inputted above?
Assistant: readline returns a single line of text including the trailing new line until the stream is closed on the other end. Once all data has been read, it starts returning empty strings to let the caller know that the stream is closed and there will never be new data. Generally, while loops should break when an empty string is returned.
You should also call proc.wait() at the end so that system information about the dead process is cleaned up.
