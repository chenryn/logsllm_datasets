#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
I have not found an easy way to access a column of a multi index by name.
Consider the following code:
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame([[1,1,10,200],
                       [1,2,11,201],
                       [1,3,12,202],
                       [2,1,13,210],
                       [2,2,14,230]],
                      columns=list('ABCD')).set_index(['A','B'])
    ii = df.index
To access the values of column B i can e.g. do:
    df.reset_index('B').B.tolist()
or
    [v[1] for v in ii.tolist()]
Both of there are somewhat cumbersome What I'm proposing is to add similar
shorcut access to a multiindex just like a dataframe. E.g.
    ii.B
or
    ii['B']
that would return the same list as in the two examples above.
