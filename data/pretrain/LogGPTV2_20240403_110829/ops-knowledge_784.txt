User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题server with high CPU and memory usage I have a server with one WordPress website on it, but the resources of the server is almost finished.  please check the image:



Where should i start to figure out the problem? should i get a server with higher resources ? 

The server has one website with 600MB DB and about 900 visits per day
Some details about the server:
- mpm prefork

    &lt;IfModule mpm_prefork_module&gt;

    StartServers            100
    #StartServers            10
    MinSpareServers         100
    MaxSpareServers         400
    MaxRequestWorkers       800
    MaxConnectionsPerChild      800
    ServerLimit         800

&lt;/IfModule&gt;

What Causes WordPress Website Performance to Falter?


Images are uploaded at unnecessarily large sizes.
Images haven’t been compressed.
Pages are too long or contain too much dynamic content.
Themes are poorly coded.
Themes use scripts that unnecessarily query the database.
Plugins are poorly coded.
Plugins run excessive external scripts.
The website is running on outdated software.
The database hasn’t been configured at all, so it’s running
inefficiently.
The web hosting plan is unable to sufficiently handle the website’s
requests.


You see, when the case is wordpress (and textual/news content site) the talk is a little bit more wider them the average performance talk for it deals with a variety of elements. Have you pursue some "WordPress Performance Tuning" tutorial on internet (like the one a used as a sample: https://wpbuffs.com/wordpress-mysql-performance-tuning/)? Are you using some kind of external cache or CDN?
