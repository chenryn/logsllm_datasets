    * Work with Team Leads/Managers on scheduling preventive actions.
The Incident Commander uses some additional call procedures and lingo:
* Always announce when you join the call if you are the on-call IC.
* **Do not** let discussions get out of hand. Keep conversations short.
* Note objections from others, but your call is final.
* If anyone is being actively disruptive to your call, kick them off.
* Announce the end of the call.
* After an incident, communicate with other training Incident Commanders on any debrief actions you feel are necessary.
**Use clear terminology, and avoid acronyms or abbreviations. Clarity and accuracy is more important than brevity.**
### Training
* Read the incident response plan, including all roles and playbooks.
* Participate in an incident response exercise.
* Shadow a current incident commander without actively participating, keeping your questions until the end.
* Reverse shadow a current incident commander.  Respond to incidents with the current IC there to take over if necessary.
* _OPTIONAL:_ facilitation training
* _OPTIONAL:_ Refer to [Incident Responders as Facilitators (and Therapists)](#FIX) and the [PagerDuty Incident Commander training](https://response.pagerduty.com/training/incident_commander/) for more ideas and discussion.
#### Prerequisites
There is no seniority or business-unit prerequisites to become an Incident Commander, it is a role open to anyone with the training and ability.  Before you can be an Incident Commander, it is expected that you meet the following criteria:
* Excellent verbal and written **communication skills**.
* **High-level knowledge** of business infrastructure and functions.
* Excellent critical thinking, judgment, and decision-making.
* Flexibility and ability to **listen to expert feedback**, modifying plans as necessary.
* **Participated in at least two incident responses**.
* Gravitas, ability to **take command**, and **willingness to kick people off a call** to remove distractions, even if it's the CEO.
Deep technical knowledge is not required!  Incident Commanders do not require deep technical knowledge of our systems. Your job as Incident Commander is to coordinate the response, not make technical changes. Don’t think you can’t be an Incident Commander just because you’re not in the engineering department.
#### Graduation
Upon completion of training, add yourself to the Incident Commander roster.
## Role: Deputy Incident Commander (Deputy)
### Description
A Deputy Incident Commander (Deputy) is a direct support role for the Incident Commander (IC). The Deputy enables the IC to focus on the problem at hand, rather than worrying about documenting steps or monitoring timers. The deputy supports the IC and keeps them focused on the incident.  As a Deputy, you will be expected to take over command from the IC if they request it.
### Duties
1. Bring up issues to the Incident Commander that may otherwise not be addressed (keeping an eye on timers that have been started, circling back around to missed items from a roll call, etc).
1. Be a "hot standby" Incident Commander, should the primary need to either transition to a SME, or otherwise have to step away from the IC role.
1. Manage the incident call, and be prepared to remove people from the call if instructed by the Incident Commander.
1. Monitor the status of the incident, and notify the IC if/when the incident escalates in severity level.
1. Monitor timers:
    * track how long the incident has been running
    * notify the IC every X minutes so they can take actions (_e.g._, "IC, be advised the incident is now at the 10 minute mark.")
1. Monitor task deadlines (e.g., "IC, be advised the timer for [TEAM]'s investigation is up.")
### Training
* Read and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.
#### Prerequisites
* Be trained as an [Incident Commander](#role-incident-commander-ic).
## Role: Scribe
### Description
A Scribe documents the timeline of an incident as it progresses, and makes sure all important decisions and data are captured for later review.  The Scribe should focus on the incident file, as well as follow-up items for later action.
### Duties
1. Ensure the incident call is being recorded.
1. Note in chat and in the file timelines: important data, events, and actions, as they happen. Specifically:
    * Key actions as they are taken
    * Status reports when one is provided by the IC
    * Any key call-outs either during the call or at the ending review
1. Update the chat with who the IC is, who the Deputy is, and that you're the scribe (if not already done).
Scribing is more art than science. The objective is to keep an accurate record of important events that occurred, Use your judgement and experience. But here are some general things you most definitely want to capture as scribe.
* The result of any polling decisions.
* Any followup items that are called out as "We should do this..", "Why didn't this?..", etc.
### Training
Read and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.
#### Prerequisites
* Excellent verbal and written **communication skills**.
* Anyone can act as a scribe during an incident, and are chosen by the Incident Commander at the start of the call.
* Typically the Deputy will act as the Scribe
#### Training Process
* Read the incident response plan, including all roles and playbooks.
* _OPTIONAL:_ Parallel the actions of a scribe during an incident or exercise, and seek feedback from the actual Scribe and Incident Commander.
## Role: Subject Matter Expert (SME)
### Description
A Subject Matter Expert (SME) is a domain expert or designated owner of a team, component, or service (an "area").  You are there to support the incident commander in identifying the cause of the incident, suggesting and evaluation investigation, remediation, and communication actions, and following through on them as tasked.
### Duties
1. Diagnose common problems within your area of expertise.
1. Rapidly fix issues found during an incident.
1. Concise communication:
    * Condition: What is the current state of your area? Is it healthy or not?
    * Actions: What actions need to be taken if your area is not in a healthy state?
    * Needs: What support do you need need to perform an action?
1. Participate in the investigation, remediation, and/or communication phases of the response.
1. Announce all suggestions to the incident commander, it is their decision on how to proceed, do not follow any actions unless told to do so.
If you are on-call for any team, you may be paged for an incident and will be expected to respond as a subject matter expert (SME) for your team, component, or service.  Anyone who is considered a "domain expert" can act as a SME for an incident. Typically the team's primary on-call will act as the SME for that team.
#### Prepare for On-Call Period
1. Be prepared, by having already familiarized yourself with our incident response policies and procedures.
1. Make sure you have set up your alerting methods in accordance with our on-call procedure.
1. Check you can join the incident call. You may need to install a browser plugin.
1. Be aware of your upcoming on-call time and arrange swaps around travel, vacations, appointments, etc.
1. If you are an Incident Commander, make sure you are not on-call for your team at the same time as being on-call as Incident Commander.
#### During On-Call Period
1. Have your laptop and Internet with you at all times during your on-call period (office, home, a MiFi, a phone with a tethering plan, etc).
1. If you have important appointments, you need to get someone else on your team to cover that time slot in advance.
1. When you receive an alert for an incident, you are expected to join the incident call and chat as quickly as possible (within minutes).
1. You will be asked questions or given actions by the Incident Commander. Answer questions concisely, and follow all actions given (even if you disagree with them).
1. If you're not sure about something, bring in other SMEs from your team that can help.  **Never hesitate to escalate**, if necessary.
1. Do not blame.  This incident response process is completely blameless: blaming is counter productive and distracts from the problem at hand.  After-action review will identify places we can all improve.
### Training
* Read and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.
## Role: Liaison
### Description
Liaisons interact with other teams or stakeholders, outside the incident response team.  These often include:
