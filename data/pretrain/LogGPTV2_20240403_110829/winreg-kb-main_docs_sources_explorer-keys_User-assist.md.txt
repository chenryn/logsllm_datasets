# User Assist key
The User Assist key contains settings and data of programs that were launched
via Windows Explorer (explorer.exe).
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Currentversion\Explorer\UserAssist
```
Sub keys:
Name | Description
--- | ---
{%GUID%} | The User Assist logged data
Settings | Settings to control User Assist logging
Note that the Settings sub key does not exist by default.

Note that the User Assist key does not seem to be present on NT4, therefore this
functionality was likely introduced in Windows 2000.
Sometimes more information about the GUID can be found in the key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\CLSID\{%GUID%}\
```
## GUID sub key
Sub keys:
Name | Description
--- | ---
Count | Contains the User Assist log entries
Values:
Name | Data type | Description
--- | --- | ---
Version | REG_DWORD | Indicates the User Assist log format version
### Version value data
Value | Windows Versions
--- | ---
3 | 2000, XP, 2003, Vista
5 | 2008 (R2?), 7, 8
### Count sub key
Values:
Name | Data type | Description
--- | --- | ---
%NAME% | REG_SZ | Where %NAME% is obfuscated using a technique described below.
Windows Versions | Obfuscation technique
--- | ---
2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008 (R2?), 7, 8 | ROT-13 of character values in the ASCII `[A-Za-z]` range. +
Values outside of this range e.g. `[0-9]` and values outside the basic ASCII range (>= 0x80) are not obfuscated.
7 beta | Vigenère cipher with key: BWHQNKTEZYFSLMRGXADUJOPIVC
#### Named value
Value | Description
--- | ---
UEME_CTLSESSION | Session identifier
UEME_CTLCUACount:ctor |
UEME_RUNCPL | Executed control applets (.cpl)
UEME_RUNPATH | Executed programs
UEME_RUNPIDL | Programs started via a PIDL (shell item list) e.g. using a Shortcut
UEME_RUNWMCMD | Programs started via a Run Command

Note does UEME stand for User Experience Monitoring Element/Extension?
Note does CTL stand for client?
Note does CUA stand for current user (file) associations?
With the exception of the UEME_CTLSESSION value, these values appear to use
a similar data types. The structure of a data type depends on the Version value
of the GUID sub key. The following versions have been observed:
* version 3, that is used by Windows 2000, XP, 2003 and Vista.
* version 5, that is used by Windows 2008 (R2?), 7, 8.
