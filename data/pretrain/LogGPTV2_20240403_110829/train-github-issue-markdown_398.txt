I've been using twitter-fetcher to circumvent Twitter's latest API without
much issues until recently when I started getting the following errors, after
posting a duplicate tweet:
    [Vue warn]: Duplicate value found in v-for="tweet in tweets": "tweet parsed from json file!". Use track-by="$index" if you are expecting duplicate values.
    vue.js:1174 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'parentNode' of null. 
Why would `v-for` throw an error when there's a duplicate value? I've
reproduced the warning here
