User: which one are you using on google app engine?
what were the reasons behind your decision?
Assistant: I'm still investigating, but I think webapp and tipfy will be a lighter framework than django.  Right now, I am using just webapp and the cold start times are already too long. I want to use tipfy for sessions and keep everything else in webapp.
What are you trying to optimize for?  Speed of development? Easy of programming? Obscure middleware?
