ABSTRACT
Graphical passwords have been proposed to address known
problems with traditional text passwords. For example,
memorable user-chosen text passwords are predictable, but
random system-assigned passwords are diﬃcult to remem-
ber. We explore the usability eﬀects of modifying system
parameters to increase the security of a click-based graphi-
cal password system. Generally, usability tests for graphical
passwords have used conﬁgurations resulting in password
spaces smaller than that of common text passwords. Our
two-part lab study compares the eﬀects of varying the num-
ber of click-points and the image size, including when diﬀer-
ent conﬁgurations provide comparable password spaces. For
comparable spaces, no usability advantage was evident be-
tween more click-points, or a larger image. This is contrary
to our expectation that larger image size (with fewer click-
points) might oﬀer usability advantages over more click-
points (with correspondingly smaller images). The results
suggest promising opportunities for better matching graph-
ical password system conﬁgurations to device constraints,
or capabilities of individual users, without degrading usabil-
ity. For example, more click-points could be used on smart-
phone displays where larger image sizes are not possible.

INTRODUCTION
The problems of knowledge-based authentication, typi-
cally text-based passwords, are well known. Users often
create memorable passwords that are easy for attackers to
guess, but strong system-assigned passwords are diﬃcult for
users to remember [25]. Users also tend to reuse passwords
across many accounts [17] and this increases the potential
impact if one account is compromised. Alternatives such as
graphical passwords [4, 26] use images instead of text for
authentication. They attempt to leverage the pictorial su-
periority eﬀect [23] which suggests that humans are better
able to remember images than text. Some graphical pass-
word systems also provide cueing [9], whereby a memory
retrieval cue is provided to help users remember and distin-

guish their passwords. In this paper we explore methods to
increase the security of cued-recall graphical passwords1.
We chose to study Persuasive Cued Click-Points (PCCP),
a click-based graphical password system in which users select
click-points on more than one image [6]. PCCP has been
shown to have good usability, while avoiding hotspots that
have been shown to aﬀect the security of other click-based
graphical password systems [7].
We address the threat of guessing attacks. This danger
arises when the total number of possible passwords is small,
or when attackers can predict likely passwords. The design
of PCCP reduces the predictability of passwords by inﬂuenc-
ing users during password creation. The number of possible
passwords with its standard conﬁguration is 243, slightly less
than that of 7-character random text passwords. A gap in
previous literature is that usability tests for graphical pass-
word schemes (in general) have only been tested for conﬁg-
urations with password spaces smaller than that of common
text passwords. To address this, we explored increasing se-
curity in PCCP, conducting a study modifying two param-
eters: the size of the images presented, and the number of
click-points in each password. The study included 82 par-
ticipants who completed two sessions scheduled two weeks
apart. Our results show that both manipulations aﬀect the
usability of the system and memorability of the passwords.
Moreover, when adjusted to provide the same level of secu-
rity, both manipulations have similar eﬀects on usability and
memorability. This suggests that when increasing security,
constraints of devices and user preferences might be accom-
modated. For example, when designing for mobile devices,
smaller images and more click-points might be used due to
smaller screen sizes.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we
ﬁrst provide some general background on graphical pass-
words, and more detail on PCCP. We then introduce our
study methodology, and its results. Finally, we discuss the
implications of the results and oﬀer our conclusions.
2. BACKGROUND
Graphical password systems [4, 26] are a type of knowledge-
based authentication that rely on the human ability to bet-
ter recognize and remember images than textual or verbal
information [23]. They fall into three main categories:
Recall: (also known as drawmetric [11]) Users recall and
reproduce a secret drawing on a blank canvas (which may

stract in the ACM CHI 2010 student research competition.

include grid-lines for guidance). Example systems include
Draw-A-Secret [20] and Pass-Go [27].
Recognition: (also known as cognometric [11] or search-
metric [24]) Users recognize and identify images from a pre-
viously memorized portfolio from a larger set of decoy im-
ages. Example systems include PassFaces [10] and D´ej`a
Vu [13].
Cued-recall: (also known as locimetric [11]) Users iden-
tify and target previously selected locations within one or
more images. The images act as memory cues to help recall
these locations. Example systems include PassPoints [31]
and Persuasive Cued Click-Points [6].
Other approaches to authentication are token-based sys-
tems and biometrics. While applicable in some cases, these
have potential drawbacks, such as risks of loss, and privacy
implications [21]. Password managers have also been pro-
posed, but usability issues and the dangers of centralization
remain unsolved problems [8].
In cued-recall click-based graphical passwords [4, 31], pass-
words consist of clicking on speciﬁc locations on one or more
images. To log in, the user must click on these previously
selected locations. The user is not expected to repeat ex-
act pixel selections. In most systems, an invisible tolerance
square is deﬁned around each click-point so that any of the
enclosed pixels are considered acceptable. Alternatively, a
grid may be visible to users [3].
In this paper, we focus on Persuasive Cued Click-Points
(PCCP) [6]. In PCCP, a user is presented with a number
of images in sequence, and must choose one click-point per
image. The ﬁrst image is assigned by the system, but each
subsequent image is determined by the user’s previous click.
In other words, clicking on diﬀerent locations on an image
results in diﬀerent next images. This provides users with
feedback about the correctness of their password entry at-
tempt — if they see the correct image, they can be fairly
certain they have selected the correct click-point on the pre-
vious image. However, this implicit feedback is not useful to
attackers who do not know the correct sequence of images.
Earlier click-based password schemes have a security weak-
ness which makes passwords easier for attackers to predict.
Users tend to select similar locations on images, forming
hotspots [19, 15, 30, 29]. They also tend to select their click-
points in predictable geometric patterns [7, 29]. To help
create more secure passwords, PCCP includes “persuasive”
elements. As shown in Figure 1, the system assists users
only during password creation by providing a viewport that
highlights a random part of the image. Users must select
a click-point within this viewport.
If users are unable to
ﬁnd a memorable point in the current viewport, they may
press the shuﬄe button to randomly reposition the view-
port. Studies [6, 7] show that this viewport, together with
the shuﬄe button, causes click-points to be more randomly
distributed, addressing the predictability problem seen in
earlier schemes.
PCCP is stronger against password-guessing attacks than
other click-based password systems and also maintains login
times and success rates comparable to text passwords [6].
However, to be seriously considered as a replacement for text
passwords, PCCP needs to be at least as secure as standard
text passwords. We can adjust the security of PCCP by ma-
nipulating several parameters, which in turn aﬀect the size
of the theoretical password space. However, little research
of this nature has been undertaken.

The theoretical password space for a password system is
the total number of unique passwords that could be gener-
ated according to the system speciﬁcations. Ideally, a larger
theoretical password space lowers the likelihood that any
particular password may be guessed. For text passwords,
the theoretical password space is typically reported as 95n,
where n is the length of the password, and 95 is the number
of typeable characters on the US English keyboard. Table 1
gives the theoretical password space for text passwords of
diﬀerent lengths. For PCCP, the theoretical password space
is calculated as: ((w × h)/t2)c, where the size of the im-
age in pixels (w × h) is divided by the size of a tolerance
square (t2, typically 192), to get the total number of tol-
erance squares per image, then is raised to the power of
the number of click-points (c). Table 2 shows the theoret-
ical password space for PCCP with diﬀerent parameters.
As shown in the tables, the theoretical password space for
PCCP can be adjusted to approximate the space of text
passwords of varying lengths. For example, an 8-character
text password has approximately the same password space
(253 or 53 bits) as a PCCP password with a small image size
(451 × 331 pixels) and 6 click-points, or a large image size
(800 × 600 pixels) and 5 click-points.
The eﬀective password space represents the set of pass-
words that users are likely to create. For example, in the
absence of enforced rules, users of text passwords typically
include only lowercase letters, limiting the eﬀective password
space to 26n. For an 8-character password, this would result
in a password space of 38 bits. Only rough estimates of the
eﬀective password space are available because user choice
is based on personal preference rather than mathematical
principles. Commonly available text password attack tools
such as John the Ripper [12] include dictionaries of up to 40
million entries, or 25 bits. Similarly, hotspots and patterns
reduce the eﬀective password space in click-based graphical
passwords. Since PCCP signiﬁcantly reduces the occurrence
of hotspots and patterns, its eﬀective password space ap-
proaches the theoretical password space. By matching the
theoretical password space of PCCP to that of text pass-
words, the corresponding eﬀective password space of PCCP
is at least as large (and likely larger) than for text passwords.

Our independent variables were the image size and the
number of click-points. As shown in Table 2, there were six
experimental conditions: S5 (small image, 5 click-points);
S6 (small image, 6 click-points); S7 (small image, 7 click-
points); L5 (large image, 5 click-points); L6 (large image, 6
click-points); and L7 (large image, 7 click-points). The small
image size was 451× 331 pixels (the size used in the original
PCCP study [6]) and the large image size was 800×600 pixels
(standardizing to a 4:3 aspect ratio). These speciﬁc settings
were chosen to approximate the theoretical password space
of text passwords. Our dependent variables concerned us-
ability, and were success rates, duration of password entry,
and number of errors. Conditions with shorter durations,
fewer errors and higher success rates were judged to have
better usability. The level of security was based on the the-
oretical password space as determined by the independent
variables. We also intended to explore the eﬀects of the dif-
ferent conditions on user behaviour in click-point selection,
possibly resulting in clustering which reduces the eﬀective
password space.
A between-subjects design was used, and the 82 partic-
ipants (47 females and 35 males) were randomly assigned
to one of six study conditions. All participants were regu-
lar computer users accustomed to using text passwords. The
majority of the participants were university undergraduates,
but no participants were studying computer security.
Participants took part in two one-on-one sessions with
the experimenter, scheduled approximately two weeks apart.
The sessions were 1 hour and 30 minutes long, respectively.
Based on previous data, we anticipated that users would
be very successful at remembering their passwords during
their ﬁrst session. We had participants wait two weeks be-
fore their second session in an eﬀort to counteract ceiling
eﬀects and provide measurable diﬀerences. Previous studies
have shown ceiling eﬀects where participants are extremely
successful at remembering their passwords within an hour
of creating them, and thus most success rates are close to
100%, providing no measurable diﬀerences when in fact dif-
ferences between conditions may be present.
In their ﬁrst session, participants initially practiced cre-
ating and re-entering passwords for two ﬁctitious accounts,
a blog and an online gaming account. This was used to ex-
plain the experimental process and familiarize participants
with the system. The practice data was discarded and par-
ticipants did not need to remember these passwords later on.
Next, participants created and re-entered PCCP passwords
for six ﬁctitious accounts (library, email, bank, online dat-
ing, instant messenger, and work). In their second session,
participants tried to re-enter these same six passwords.
The experiment used a custom stand-alone J# applica-
tion running on a Windows desktop computer. A set of
465 images was used, and no images were repeated between
or within passwords for a given user. The small and large
image conditions shared the same images except that they
were displayed at diﬀerent resolutions. Figure 1 shows the
user interface for creating passwords with the two diﬀer-
ent image sizes. The size of the viewport during password
creation was kept consistent at 75× 75 pixels across all con-
ditions. Similarly, the tolerance square during all password
re-entry phases was 19 × 19 for all conditions. There were
ﬁve experiment phases over the two sessions. In the ﬁrst ses-
sion, participants completed the create, conﬁrm, login and
recall-1 phases.
In the second session, participants com-

3. STUDY
Our study explored ways of increasing the password space
of PCCP by changing the conﬁguration of the system. With
PCCP, three parameters can be manipulated: the image
size, the number of click-points per password, and the size of
the tolerance square. In this study, we increased the number
of click-points in each password and increased the size of
the images presented. Our goal was to determine which
manipulation resulted in better usability and memorability
for approximately equivalent password spaces (as a proxy for
security). We chose to keep the size of the tolerance square
constant (set to 19×19 as determined in previous studies [31,
5]) because its size is constrained by human visual acuity [16]
and ﬁne motor control. We had three hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1(a): Increasing the number of click-points
will decrease usability (as deﬁned below).
Hypothesis 1(b): Increasing the size of the image will
decrease usability.
Hypothesis 2: For conditions with approximately com-
parable theoretical password spaces, the condition with the
larger image size will have better usability (i.e., L5 would
have better usability than S6, and L6 would have better
usability than S7).
Our rationale for hypothesis 2 was that conditions with
fewer click-points would have better usability because we
speculated that the cognitive load and the physical task of
entering another click-point would dominate the inspection
task of ﬁnding a click-point on a larger image.

pleted the recall-2 phase, and were debriefed and compen-
sated for their time. Descriptions of the experiment phases
are given below. For each of the six accounts:
Create Phase (Session 1): Participants selected points
on images to create their password.
Conﬁrm Phase (Session 1): Participants re-entered
the same password to make sure they remembered it. They
could re-try as many times as necessary and could reset their
password if it was forgotten.
Login Phase (Session 1): Participants attempted to
log in to the account using the same password. They could
re-try as many times as necessary and could reset their pass-
word if it was forgotten.
Once the user had created all their passwords:
Recall-1 Phase (Session 1): Participants attempted to
log in to each account in a shuﬄed order. Multiple attempts
were allowed and participants could say they had forgotten
a password to move to the next account.
Recall-2 Phase (Session 2): Two weeks later, partici-
pants attempted to log in to their accounts in the same shuf-
ﬂed order. Multiple attempts were allowed and participants
had the option of saying they had forgotten a password to
move to the next account.
4. RESULTS
In this section, we report on the eﬀects of the indepen-
dent variables (number of click-points and image size) on
success rates, errors and durations of password entry. We
used statistical analysis to determine whether diﬀerences in
the data were likely to reﬂect actual diﬀerences between con-
ditions or whether these might reasonably have occurred by
chance. Speciﬁc tests will be described throughout the sec-
tion as they are reported. In all cases, we regard a value of
p < .05 as indicating statistical signiﬁcance. In such cases
there is less than a 5% probability that these results oc-
curred by chance. In the tables reporting statistics, results
in bold are statistically signiﬁcant. Several ﬁgures in this
section show boxplots to illustrate distributions. Boxplots
show the median, the inner quartiles (as a box), and the
outer quartiles (as whiskers).
We report on each dependent variable individually, assess-
ing each in relation to the two hypotheses. The phases from
Session 1 (create, conﬁrm, login, recall-1) provide a measure
of usability in the short-term, while Session 2’s recall-2 phase
provides a measure of usability after two weeks. Results for
each hypothesis are summarized at the end of this section.
Since each user had six separate passwords, we aggregated
the data by users to ensure independence in the data. For
success rates, we tabulated the number of successful pass-
word entries per user, giving a number between 0 and 6.
