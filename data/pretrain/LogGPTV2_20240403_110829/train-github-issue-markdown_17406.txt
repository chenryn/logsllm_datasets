Hello! I would like to use Glide and Material Components in my project. Below are the dependencies I have included:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0-alpha3'
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.0.0-alpha3'
    implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.7.1'
    annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.7.1'
}
```

I am targeting API level 28. However, when I try to build the project, I encounter the following error:

```
Program type already present: android.support.v4.os.ResultReceiver$1
Message{kind=ERROR, text=Program type already present: android.support.v4.os.ResultReceiver$1, sources=[Unknown source file], tool name=Optional.of(D8)}
org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskExecutionException: Execution failed for task ':app:transformDexArchiveWithExternalLibsDexMergerForDebug'.
...
Caused by: com.android.tools.r8.CompilationFailedException: Compilation failed to complete
...
Caused by: com.android.tools.r8.utils.AbortException
...
```

This error indicates a conflict with the `android.support.v4` package, which is likely due to mixing AndroidX and support libraries. To resolve this issue, you should ensure that all your dependencies are using AndroidX. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Migrate to AndroidX**: If you haven't already, migrate your project to AndroidX. You can do this by going to `Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX` in Android Studio.

2. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure that all your dependencies are compatible with AndroidX. For example, update the Material Components and RecyclerView dependencies to their latest stable versions:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0' // Update to the latest version
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.2.1' // Update to the latest version
    implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.12.0' // Update to the latest version
    annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.12.0' // Update to the latest version
}
```

3. **Check for Conflicting Libraries**: Make sure there are no conflicting libraries in your `libs` directory or other dependencies that might be pulling in the old support library.

4. **Sync Project**: After making these changes, sync your project with Gradle files.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `Program type already present` error and successfully build your project.
