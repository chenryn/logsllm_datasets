Question: "In the context of software design, it is considered a poor practice to use the same control element across multiple architectural layers due to the potential introduction of vulnerabilities. Based on this principle, which of the following scenarios would NOT indicate the use of the same invokable control element in multiple architectural layers?"
 "A": "A web application uses a single authentication function that is called both by the presentation layer when users log in and by the data access layer to verify user permissions for database operations."
 "B": "A service-oriented architecture deploys a user input validation module that is exclusively used within the presentation layer to sanitize incoming data before it is processed by business logic."
 "C": "An enterprise application framework utilizes the same logging mechanism for recording errors in the business logic layer and in the data access layer."
 "D": "An embedded system firmware uses a common interrupt handler to manage both user interface events and internal hardware events."
Answer: B
