It would be useful if the route generator could filter by certain route
criteria, especially "host".
_(Sorry, I already posted in#6088 but that issue is already closed, and the
request was for a different use case.)_
Here is a possible use case for a generator that filters by host, please feel
free to point out an alternative approach though. In short, I want to be able
to do something like this in Twig:
    {{ path('contact') }}
and get the right route depending on the current hostname (but other
applications might have other criteria).
Let's say I have English and German versions of a site, under different
domains: example.co.uk and example.de. Then, I can import groups of routes
like this:
        uk_routes:
            resource: @MyBundle/Resources/config/routing_uk.yml
            host: "example.co.uk"
        de_routes:
            resource: @MyBundle/Resources/config/routing_de.yml
            host: "example.de"
Then, in each file, I might try something like this:
        # routing_uk.yml
        contact:
            path: /contact
            defaults:
                _controller: my_site.controller.default:contactAction
        # routing_de.yml
        contact:
            path: /kontakt
            defaults:
                _controller: my_site.controller.default:contactAction
_But..._ this won't work, because one "contact" route silently overwrite the
other.
An "alias" (or "forward") parameter would help here:
        # routing_uk.yml
        uk_contact:
            alias: contact
            path: /contact
            defaults:
                _controller: my_site.controller.default:contactAction
            options:
                foo: bar_uk_example
        # routing_de.yml
        de_contact:
            alias: contact
            path: /uber_uns
            defaults:
                _controller: my_site.controller.default:contactAction
            options:
                foo: bar_de_example
If only one route had the "contact" alias, it's easy for the Generator to know
which route to use (we could even just duplicate the route behind the scenes,
to save a copy and paste).
But here, the routing generator is faced with two different routes with the
same alias. So it needs to decide which one to pick. In this case, I want it
to filter on the `host` (each route has this, but I defined it at the file
level instead of each route). Maybe there are other things to filter on too,
so it should be configurable/extensible.
For now, I have created a very basic route generator that does this. It's part
of a very rough/experimental bundle that should probably be split apart, but
hopefully it gives an idea.
Of course, I could be looking at this the wrong way. Maybe we don't need route
aliases, but namespaces? Or multiple routers (but then, how to select which
one is being used?)
I also started a mailing list topic about this. I'm interested to know the
best approach, how other people satisfy this use case, and whether a future
Symfony route generator can allow allow multiple route candidates (aliases, or
similar).
