    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    1. This bug is a duplicate of bug 3511 which was not correctly fixed
    https://golang.org/issue/3511
    If req.Method == 'POST' (anything other than GET and HEAD) the bug can be still
    reproduced.
    2. Here is how to patch test to reproduce the failure.

    HTTP cookies set for all methods.
    What do you see instead?
    HTTP cookies are not set for POST, PUT, etc.
