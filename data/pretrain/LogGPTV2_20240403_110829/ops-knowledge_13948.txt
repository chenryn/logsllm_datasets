User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to log the URL scheme (http / https) in Apache? nginx has the $scheme variable usable in its log_format lines.

%H is the request protocol (e.g. "HTTP/1.1").

How can I do the same with Apache?

Assistant: One way to do it is to have two conditional CustomLog directives, controlled by whether the HTTPS variable is set.

CustomLog logs/access.log "https://..." env=HTTPS
CustomLog logs/access.log "http://..." env=!HTTPS


I have also tried using SetEnvIf in the following manner, but it doesn't work (it logs -):

SetEnv URL_SCHEME=http
SetEnvIf HTTPS on URL_SCHEME=https
CustomLog logs/access.log "%{URL_SCHEME}e://..."
