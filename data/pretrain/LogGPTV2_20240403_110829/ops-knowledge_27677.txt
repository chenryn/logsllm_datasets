User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Ubuntu 12.04 logger won't write to remote syslog I'm trying to use logger to send events to a remote syslog server. The syslog server is Ubuntu 12.04 running the default rsyslogd. The "client" servers are both Ubuntu 12.04 and SLES11SP1. On SLES11, I can send events to the syslog server successfully. Tcpdump shows them successfully being sent from the SLES client:

CEIDMLDAP-LS02:~ # tcpdump udp -n dst portrange 514
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes
11:07:58.865116 IP 10.192.0.108.34249 &gt; 10.192.3.104.514: SYSLOG user.notice, length: 59
11:09:07.921309 IP 10.192.0.108.34249 &gt; 10.192.3.104.514: SYSLOG user.notice, length: 77


On the Ubuntu syslog server tcpdump also shows them being received and they show up in /var/log/messages there. However, I can't get logger to send anything from the Ubuntu 12.04 clients even though logger on that OS has a special switch for designating the remote server. I've tried many variations of the command line:

logger -n &lt;ip&gt; Message
logger -n &lt;ip&gt; -d -P 514 Message
etc


None of these efforts are shown by tcpdump as even leaving the client server. They simply never seem to happen at all.

I'm running logger from a sudo su shell. Interestingly when I simply use logger to send a message to the local syslog, it seems to record it as from my account, but when I send remote, it records it as from logger. This may be normal, but I include it for detail.

I'm really hoping that I'm missing something obvious like a dependent package that I haven't installed, but I haven't been able to discover it yet. If not that, does anyone have any ideas how I could get this working?

Assistant: This bug was fixed in version 2.24.2-1 of logger(1).

A workaround is to specify a socket (which is then ignored):

logger -n &lt;ip&gt; -d -P 514 -u /tmp/ignored Message

That worked for me, using logger from util-linux 2.20.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.
