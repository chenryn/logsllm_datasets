 You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
 You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest

Can somebody help me with above error , I am getting.
Just to let everybody know I am trying to install cx_Oracle on my CentOS system (CentOS release 6.4) and I got this error:-
 error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
So, I searched and found out to install python-devel and to do that I am getting the above error.
Assistant: You have a newer version of python installed than the corresponding source package you're trying to install.
You have python 2.6.6-37 installed but the latest available source package from your repos (that you can successfully connect to) is 2.6.6-36.
But it looks like the python you have installed came from your "updates" repo,
http://192.168.210.26/centos/6/updates/i386/repodata/repomd.xml which isn't working at t he moment.
If that repo also had the corresponding python-devel-2.6.6-37 package, and it worked, (didn't throw a PYCURL error) you'd be fine, yum would find that and use it.
So your first step should be fixing your LAN repo / mirror.
