IPv4 addresses are only found by ZMap. Even though the success
rate of HTTPS DNS RR scans is low (see Figure 3), it offers 12 k
unique addresses.
While the overall number of seen IPv6 addresses is smaller,
the overlap is similar with 68 k addresses. Only 855 addresses are
uniquely seen in HTTPS DNS RR and 136 k addresses are from ZMap.
The largest share of unique IPv6 addresses is from the HTTP ALT-
SVC Header with 208 k IPv6 addresses.
While some addresses found by alternative service discovery
mechanisms are missed by ZMap due to network events, most
differences are due to deployments not implementing the version
negotiation mechanism as used by our ZMap module. Stateful scans
presented in Section 5 show, that even though found deployments
do not react to the implemented ZMap module, the QScanner is
able to communicate with multiple of these targets, either resulting
in successful handshakes or QUIC specific alerts. In contrast, ZMap
is able to detect further IP addresses supporting QUIC, missed
by domain based scans from a single vantage point due to load
balancing.
Key take-away. Analyzing the found number of QUIC deploy-
ments based on the three described discovery methods illustrates
their differences. Each methodology reveals unique QUIC deploy-
ments due to differences in QUIC implementations but also con-
figurations and thus their behavior in respect to our scans. At the
moment, research needs to rely on different sources of QUIC capa-
ble targets to allow a holistic analysis of QUIC and its deployment
on the Internet.
ZMap indicates QUIC support for most IPv4 addresses but based
on our DNS scans, domains resolve to only 10 % of found addresses.
We analyze whether successful handshakes are possible without a
domain in Section 5. In comparison, alternative service discovery
approaches reveal fewer addresses but HTTP ALT-SVC Headers
reveal similar amounts of domains reachable using QUIC. The low
success rate of HTTPS DNS RR scans drastically limits the utility
of the scan at the moment. We argue that the low success rate is
mainly due to the early stage of the draft [41].
We suggest re-evaluating this finding in future work, to analyze
whether the final standardization of QUIC results in the conver-
gence of deployments towards a similar behavior and thus, whether
a single detection approach suffices.
4.1 Who deploys and uses QUIC?
To evaluate the distribution of deployments in regard to providers,
we analyze which ASes announce ranges containing QUIC capable
IP addresses. Figure 4 shows the distribution of addresses, which
indicate QUIC support either based on a successful version nego-
tiation with ZMap, with an HTTP ALT-SVC Header during TLS
over TCP scans or an HTTPS DNS RR, across ASes ranked by the
number of addresses per AS. For IPv6 addresses, the overall number
of hits and corresponding ASes is not only smaller, but the top AS
already covers between 60 % for ZMap and 99 % for HTTPS DNS
RR. Considering ZMap for IPv4, the top AS covers only 35 %, but
the top 4 already covers 80 %. The most even distribution can be

seen for HTTP ALT-SVC Headers where the top AS only covers
35 %, and only after 100 ASes, an 80 % coverage is reached.
Table 2 shows the top 5 ASes for IPv4 addresses (a mapping
between AS numbers and their names can be found in Appen-
dix B Table 7). Cloudflare (AS13335) originates most addresses for
all sources but IPv6 addresses in combination with their HTTP
ALT-SVC Headers. The latter source is dominated by Hostinger
(AS47583). Interestingly, Google (AS15169) as initial force behind
QUIC is Rank 2 based on ZMap scans, Rank 3 based on HTTPS DNS
RRs and only Rank 6 based on HTTP ALT-SVC Headers. Most
of the remaining top ASes are cloud providers like DigitalOcean
(AS14061), Akamai (AS2094), or OVH (AS16276).
Key take-away. The analysis shows that the early deployments
can mainly be found in ASes operated by large providers. Neverthe-
less, deployments can be found in more than 4700 different ASes.
Using HTTPS DNS RRs to discover QUIC capable hosts is mainly
limited to Cloudflare at the moment. We investigate whether de-
ployments distributed accros ASes are set up by individuals or
operated by large providers in Section 5 based on stateful scans.
4.2 Deployed Versions
We use the version negotiation results from ZMap scans but also
versions directly indicated as ALPN value in HTTPS DNS RRs and the
HTTP ALT-SVC Header. Figure 5 shows the distribution of version
sets announced by servers in the version negotiation packet during
the IPv4 ZMap scans. Other combines 46 sets with a visibility of less
than 1 % each. Figure 6 shows the frequency of individual versions.
Versions starting with Q and T indicate Google QUIC without and
with TLS respectively and versions including mvfst are Facebook
specific.
The sets solely consisting of IETF versions are primarily used by
Cloudflare (AS13335). They are mainly responsible for the change of

sets in week 18 to a new set including IETF “Version 1”. At the end
of our scanning period, IETF “Version 1” was seen in 95 different
ASes. While the version was mentioned in draft 34, it was labeled
as "do not deploy" [22].
Google (AS15169) announces the set consisting of Google QUIC
versions (including T051) but also IETF draft-29. We show in Sec-
tion 5 that this set was often inconsistent to the actual server be-
havior observable as version mismatches in our stateful scan. The
set with only Google QUIC versions was mainly used by Akamai
(AS2094) at the beginning, but they started to include IETF draft-29
throughout our measurement period. Regarding individual ver-
sions, Figure 6 shows on one hand, that 50 % of found addresses
still support Google QUIC. On the other hand, the frequency of
IETF draft-29 increases form 80 % in February to 96 % in May 2021.
267
IETF draft-27 is seen more often than draft-28 mainly due to Fastly
(AS54113) announcing the set, draft-29 and draft-27.
Results from HTTPS DNS RRs and HTTP ALT-SVC Headers do
not contain exact QUIC versions but HTTP ALPN values including
the draft version, e.g., h3-29 (see Section 2). Furthermore, the ALPN
can be different for domains even when they share the same IP
address. Therefore, the following analysis is based on targets as
combination of (Domain, IP address)-pairs.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of ALPN sets retrieved from
HTTP ALT-SVC Headers. Other combines all sets with an occur-
rence of less than 1 %. The remaining sets can be divided into three
groups, (i) a set only consisting of IETF QUIC versions, (ii) sets in-
cluding Google QUIC versions covering different ranges and (iii) a
