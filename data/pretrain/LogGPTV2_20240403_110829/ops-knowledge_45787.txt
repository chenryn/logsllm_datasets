User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题EC2 Instance will not stop or terminate after trying to create an AMI from the running instance After a routine reboot of a Linux ec2 instance with 1 small root volume and 1 small attached volume I was not able to ssh into the instance.  It is not clear why rebooting the instance caused it to be inaccessible from ssh.  The instance showed as running in the AWS console but ssh, http,etc was not responsive.  I tried to create an AMI from this running instance.  However, the AMI was never created.  Instead I just saw "pending" in the AMI section of the AWS console for hours.  Eventually I de-registered the AMI.  Next I tried to stop the ec2 instance.  However I am not able to stop the instance - it has been stuck in the stopping state for hours. I also tried force stopping the instance with no success.  I then tried to detach the volumes but they constantly report "detaching"  Does anyone have any suggestions about how to handle this?  It seems that Amazon does not offer any kind of email or phone support unless you are a premium member.  Thanks very much for your help.

Assistant: If you don't have premium support, then "stuck" instances (where you can't stop/terminate them) and "stuck" volumes (where you can't detach/delete them) can be reported to Amazon on the EC2 forum:

Make sure you list the specific instance/volume ids involved.

Nobody but Amazon can really help in these situations.

Fortunately, you should not be charged for instance hours once it enters the "stopping" or "terminating" state.

Your original problem about not being able to connect to the instance through ssh could also be posted on the EC2 forum for help from the community, but it is a common problem and has many potential causes.  I've written an article to help start diagnose this and to point out pieces of information you should include in your forum post:

I've also written an article describing a method that can be used to diagnose EBS boot instances by looking at the log files on the disk even if you can't connect to the instance:

However, you won't be able to use this approach until Amazon helps you detach your EBS volume.
