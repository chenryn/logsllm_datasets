I just noticed that the definition for the `img` element includes the `max-
width` property. This seems to break the controls for the Google Maps v3 API,
causing very odd graphics to load for the zoom control.
Placing in some additional CSS to overwrite the Bootstrap definition fixes the
problem. The CSS I used was: .
    gmnoprint img {
        max-width: none
    }
