When creating and using an enum (TypeScript 1.4, Visual Studio 2013). When I
build the project the enum value is compiled to a number, but if I save the
file the compiled output is the full name of the enum. For example:
    // enum.ts
    enum SomeEnum {
        One = 1,
        Two = 2
    }
    // consumer.ts
    class Consumer {
        public doSomething(): void {
            var x: SomeEnum = SomeEnum.One;
        } 
    } 
When the project is built, it compiles to:
    var Consumer = (function () {
        function Consumer() {
        }
        Consumer.prototype.doSomething = function () {
            var x = 1 /* One */;
        };
        return Consumer;
    })();
However when I edit and save "consumer.ts" it compiles to:
    var Consumer = (function () {
        function Consumer() {
        }
        Consumer.prototype.doSomething = function () {
            var x = SomeEnum.One;
        };
        return Consumer;
    })();
The issue is that the enum values are sitting in a DomainModels.d.ts file
(that is converted from C# using TypeLite). So the definition of the enum is
never included in the output.
The preferred output would be always compiling to a number.
