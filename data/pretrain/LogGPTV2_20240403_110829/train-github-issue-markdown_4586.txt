    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. create file "a" and "b"
    2. run `os.Rename("a", "b")`
    What is the expected output?
    file "b" should be atomically replaced with file "a" 
    What do you see instead?
    rename a b: Cannot create a file when that file already exists.
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    6g
    Which operating system are you using?
    windows 8 64-bit
    Which version are you using?  (run 'go version')
    go version go1.1rc3 windows/amd64
    I think it should use MoveFileEx syscall with MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING flag set instead
    of plain MoveFile syscall.
