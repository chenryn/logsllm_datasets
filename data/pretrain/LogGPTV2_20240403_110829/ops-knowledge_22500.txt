User: I have been having trouble installing pip modules. I have python 3.4 and windows 10. When i type into cmd python pip install [package], the computer comes up with an error saying "This app can't run on your pc" and cmd returns "Access is denied."
would this be a windows 10 incompatibility or is there something im missing/doing wrong?
Thanks in advance for help
