User: I have installed Python 3.2 in my Mac. After I run /Applications/Python 3.2/Update Shell Profile.command, it's confusing that when I type Python -V in Terminal it says that Python 2.6.1.
How can I change the default Python version?
Assistant: Navigate to:
My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> System Variables
Suppose you had already having python 2.7 added in path variable and you want to change default path to python 3.x
then add path of python3.5.x folder before python2.7 path.
open cmd: type "python --version"
python version will be changed to python 3.5.x
