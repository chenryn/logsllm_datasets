User: I would like to drag and drop my data file onto a Python script and have it process the file and generate output. The Python script accepts the name of the data file as a command-line parameter, but Windows Explorer doesn't allow the script to be a drop target.
Is there some kind of configuration that needs to be done somewhere for this work?
Assistant: Try using py2exe.  Use py2exe to convert your python script into a windows executable.  You should then be able to drag and drop input files to your script in Windows Explorer.  You should also be able to create a shortcut on your desktop and drop input files onto it.  And if your python script can take a file list you should be able to drag and drop multiple files on your script (or shortcut).
