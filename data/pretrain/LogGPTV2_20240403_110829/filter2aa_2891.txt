## Introduction to VoIP
### Overview
- **Pervasiveness:**
  - **Home:** Vonage, Skype, TeamSpeak, Comcast, etc.
  - **Office:** Cisco, Avaya, Lucent, Asterisk, etc.
- **Ease of Deployment:**
  - Most systems are "plug and talk" with user-friendly web interfaces for configuring features like voicemail, call forwarding, and conference calls.

### Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
- **Request/Response Model:**
  - Manages the setup and teardown of voice and video calls.
- **Firewall and NAT Traversal:**
  - Designed to penetrate firewalls and NAT.
- **Security:**
  - Basic identification mechanisms, often not required in most PBXs, and easily sniffed.

## VoIP as a Getaway Car
- **Traversing Firewalls:**
  - VoIP can easily traverse firewalls.
- **External Network Access:**
  - Can go outside the corporate network over PSTN lines, without needing the internet.
- **Monitoring Evasion:**
  - Rarely monitored, making it an ideal exfiltration method.

## What is a VoIP Botnet?
- **Concept:**
  - Replace traditional C&C channels with VoIP.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Mobility:** NAT traversal capabilities.
  - **Legitimacy:** Blends into legitimate traffic.
  - **Stealth:** Harder to inspect (e.g., RTP packets).

## Who Needs a VoIP Botnet?
- **Potential Users:**
  - **Botmasters:** More mobile and anonymous.
  - **C&C Servers:** Conference call bridge numbers are readily available.
  - **Data Transfer:** Capable of transferring significant amounts of data.
  - **Covert Communications:** Emerging as an alternative method.

## VoIP Botnet in Action
- **Use Cases:**
  - Red team penetration testing.
  - Botnets in no-internet or closed networks.
  - Botnets for VoIP phones.

## VoIP Botnet Architecture
- **Communication Types:**
  - **Unicast:**
    - Bot calls Bot Master.
    - Bot Master calls Bot (registered extension on his PBX).
  - **Multicast:**
    - Bots join a conference call.
    - Bot Master joins the conference call.
- **Conference Call as "IRC Channel":**
  - Bots and Bot Master communicate via conference calls.

## The Call
- **Calling Methods:**
  - TCP/IP (SIP, H.323, etc.)
  - PSTN/VoIP trunk

## Moshi Moshi
- **Open-source VoIP Bot:**
  - **Protocol:** SIP
  - **Output:** Text-to-speech engines
  - **Input:** DTMF tones
  - **Download:** [Moshi Moshi on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/moshimoshi/)

## DTMF Tones
- **Definition:**
  - Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling used for communication over telephone lines.
- **Standardization:**
  - Standardized and compatible with any phone.

## Asterisk as C&C and DTMF
- **Asterisk:**
  - Free software that transforms a computer into a communication server.
  - **Version Used:** AsteriskNow 1.7.1 Linux Distribution.
  - **MeetMe:** A conference bridge that supports DTMF passing through the conference.
  - **Configuration:** Add 'F' option to MEETME_OPTS in `extensions.conf` to pass DTMF through the conference.

## DTMF Pass Through/Relaying
- **Example:**
  - Conference call relays DTMF tones to other participants.
  - **Example Configuration:**
    - `*` is End of Line (EOL).
    - `#` is a delimiter (i.e., space).
    - `0#*` invokes command 0 without arguments.
    - `1#123#*` invokes command 1 with one argument '123'.
    - `2#1#2#*` invokes command 2 with arguments '1' and '2'.

## Text-to-Speech as Data Leakage
- **Usage:**
  - Voice can be used to read back passwords, documents, settings, and acknowledgments.
  - Built-in Text-to-Speech engines in Mac and Windows, or external utilities for conversion.

## The Getaway: Modulation
- **Binary Data Transformation:**
  - Convert binary data to sounds.
  - **Proof of Concept:**
    - Each half-byte corresponds to one of 16 octaves within the human audible range (~200Hz - ~2000Hz).
    - Use 0.5-second tones for legibility in a conference call.

## Demo: Binary Data Modulation -> Data Exfiltration
- **Steps:**
  - Transform data to sound.
  - Dial and leave a message.
  - Transform the recorded message back to data.

## VoIP as VPN
- **Alternative Internet Access:**
  - Unmonitored access.
  - No DLP, firewalls, IDS/IPS/DPI.
  - Allows using existing C&C protocols (IRC, HTTP).
  - Bot Master can explore the botnet (e.g., nmap â€“sS 10.0.0.0/8).

## TCP/IP over VoIP
- **Modem Protocols:**
  - V.42/HDLC/PPP
  - Works with hardware and software modems.
  - Operates within the voice frequency band.
  - Functional under poor connectivity conditions.
  - Provides two-way communication.

## Did You Hear That?
- **VoIP Botnets:**
  - As effective or better than IRC, P2P, and HTTP botnets.
  - **Strengths:**
    - Operated from payphones or mobiles.
    - Accessed from both PSTN and the internet.
    - Not blocked by typical IDS/IPS signatures.

## Countermeasures
- **Network Segregation:**
  - Separate VoIP from the corporate network.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Monitor VoIP activity as you do for web and email.
- **Whitelisting:**
  - Consider whitelisting conference call numbers.

## The Future Sound of Botnets
- **Speech-to-Text:**
  - As input for commands.
- **Going Mobile:**
  - Text-to-SMS as output.
  - SMS-to-voice calls as input.
- **New Appliances:**
  - T.38 (Fax) as output (e.g., "screen shots").
- **Old Appliances:**
  - Modem (PPP) as input/output (e.g., "internal VPN").
