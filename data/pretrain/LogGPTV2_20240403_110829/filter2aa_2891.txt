Sounds Like Botnet 
Intro to VoIP 
• It’s everywhere 
– Home (Vonage, Skype, TeamSpeak, Comcast, 
etc…) 
– Office (Cisco, Avaya, Lucent, Asterisk, etc…) 
• Easy to deploy 
– Most are “plug and talk” with fancy web interfaces 
to configure features such as voicemail, 
forwarding, conference calls, etc… 
Overview of SIP 
• Request/Response model 
• Responsible for setup/teardown of 
voice/video calls 
• Designed to allow “piercing” of firewalls, NAT, 
etc… 
• Security? meh… (basic identification, usually 
not required in most PBXs,  easily sniffed…) 
VoIP as a Getaway Car 
• So… VoIP can traverse firewalls easily 
• And can go outside the corporate network 
over PSTN lines (no internetz needed…) 
• And is rarely monitored (“can you hear me 
now” ain’t gonna pass through the DLP…) 
• EXFILTRATE! 
What is a VoIP Botnet 
• Take your good ol’e botnet  
• Disconnect all C&C channels 
• Replace with VoIP 
• Profit? 
• Fully mobilized (NAT piercing) 
• Looks more legit (try to pick THAT out of the 
traffic) 
• Harder to peek into (can you spell “whazzzzup?” 
in RTP?) 
Who Needs a VoIP Botnet 
• Well, everyone… 
• Botmaster is more mobile (literally) 
• More anonymous C&C servers (conf call bridge 
numbers are aplenty…) 
• Can actually transfer fair amounts of data 
back/forth (remember the modem days?) 
• It’s starting to show up as alternative methods of 
covert communications 
– Sorry spooks…  
VoIP Botnet in Action 
• Red Team Penetration Testing Engagement 
• Botnet in No Internet/Closed Networks 
• Botnet for VoIP Phones 
VoIP Botnet Architecture 
• Telephony systems allows both Unicast and 
Multicast communication 
• Unicast: 
– Bot calls Bot Master 
– Bot Master calls Bot (registered ext. on his PBX) 
• Multicast: 
– Bot A calls Conference Call 
– Bot B calls Conference Call 
– Bot Master joins Conference Call 
VoIP Botnet Architecture 
• Conference Call as “IRC Channel” 
Conference Call

The Call 
• Calling can be made via TCP/IP or PSTN

Moshi Moshi 
• Open-source VoIP Bot written in Python 
– Uses SIP as VoIP Protocol 
– Uses Text-to-speech Engines for Output 
– Uses DTMF Tones for Input

• DTMF (Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling) 
are used for signaling over telephone lines in 
the voice-frequency band between telephone 
handsets and other devices and switching 
centers. 
• DTMF tones are standardized and can be sent 
and received from any phone 
Asterisk as C&C and DTMF 
• Asterisk is free software that transforms a 
computer into a communication server 
• We’re using AsteriskNow 1.7.1 Linux Distribution 
• MeetMe is a conference bridge for Asterisk 
and supports passing DTMF through the 
conference.  
• To pass DTMF through the conference add ‘F’ 
option to MEETME_OPTS at extensions.conf 
DTMF Pass through/Relaying 
• Conf. Call to relay DTMF to other calls 
Conference Call

Bot C: Heard 1# 
Bot B: Heard 1#

DTMF Tones as C&C 
• The (made-up) Rules 
– ‘*’ is End of Line (EOL) 
– ‘#’ is a delimiter (i.e. Space) 
• Examples 
– ‘0#*’ invoke command 0 without arguments 
– ‘1#123#*’ invoke command 1 with one arg ‘123’ 
– ‘2#1#2#*’ invoke command 2 with args ‘1’ and ‘2’ 
• It’s your rules – go wild… 
Ring, Ring! 
Text-to-Speech as Data Leakage 
• It's only natural that since we don’t have visuals 
in phone conversation, to use voice 
• Passwords, documents, settings and 
acknowledgements can all be read back 
• Some systems (Mac, Windows) includes built-in 
Text-to-Speech engines, others requires 
installation 
• External utilities can be used to convert different 
formats (e.g. Microsoft Word) into simpler text 
files 
Talk to me… Woo hoo! 
The Getaway: Modulation 
• Take any arbitrary binary data 
• Devise a way to transform bytes to sounds 
– PoC: every ½ byte  one of 16 octaves within the 
human audible range (~200Hz - ~2000Hz) 
• Record each ½ byte octave  
– PoC uses ½ second tones (for legibility in a 
conference ) 
• Music to my ears… 
Demo: Binary Data Modulation -> Data 
Exfiltration 
• Transform data to sound 
• Dial, leave a message… 
• Transform recorded message to data 
• Profit? 
ET Phone Home! 
VoIP as VPN 
• Alternative unmonitored Internet access 
– No DLP 
– No Firewalls 
– No IDS/IPS/DPI 
• Allows using already-existing C&C protocols 
– IRC 
– HTTP 
• Bot Master can easily explore his Botnet 
– nmap –sS 10.0.0.0/8 
TCP/IP over VoIP 
• Bring back Modems to the game 
• Use V.42/HDLC/PPP protocols 
IP 
UDP 
SIP/RTSP

Did You Hear That? 
• VoIP Botnets are as good and even better in 
some cases, than IRC, P2P, and HTTP Botnets.  
• VoIP Botnets strengths: 
– Can be operated from a payphone, or a Mobile. 
– Can be accessed from both PSTN and Internet 
– Are not blocked by your typical IDS/IPS signatures 
Countermeasures 
• Separate VoIP from Corporate Network 
– Yes, COMPLETELY! 
• Monitor VoIP Activity 
– It’s your data. Same as you do for web/emails… 
• Consider whitelisting Conf. Call Numbers 
The Future Sound of Botnets 
• Hearing is Believing  
– Speech-to-Text as Input 
• Going Mobile 
– Text-to-SMS as Output 
– SMS-to-Voice Calls as Input 
• Meeting new Appliances 
– T.38 (Fax) as Output (e.g. “Screen Shots”) 
• Meeting old Appliances 
– Modem (PPP) as Input/Output (e.g. “Internal VPN”)
