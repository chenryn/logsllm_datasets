Abstract.  A  Mobile  Ad  Hoc  Network  (MANET)  is  a  distributed  commun-
ication platform for mobile wireless nodes. Because of the lack of a centralized 
monitoring  point,  intrusion  detection  systems  (IDS)  for  MANET  are  usually 
developed using a distributed architecture where detectors are deployed at each 
node  to  cooperatively  detect  attacks.  However,  most  of  these  distributed  IDS 
simply  assume  that  each  detector  exchanges  complete  information  with  their 
peers instead of establishing an efficient message  exchanging protocol among 
detectors.  We  propose  a  Distributed  Evidence-driven  Message  Exchanging 
intrusion  detection  Model  (DEMEM)  for  MANET  that  allows  the  distributed 
detector  to  cooperatively  detect  routing  attacks  with  minimal  communication 
overhead.  The  framework  allows  detectors  to  exchange  evidences  only  when 
necessary. Under a few practical assumptions, we implement DEMEM to detect 
routing attacks the Optimal Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. The example 
scenarios and performance metrics in the experiment demonstrate that DEMEM 
can  detect  routing  attacks  with  low  message  overhead  and  delay,  no  false 
negatives, and very low false positives under various mobility conditions with 
message  lost.  Our  ongoing  works  include  implementing  DEMEM  in  AODV, 
DSR and TBRPF, and a reputation-based cooperative intrusion response model.

1   Introduction 
A  mobile  ad  hoc  network  (MANET)  consists  of  mobile  nodes  that  cooperatively 
communicate with each other without a pre-established infrastructure. In a MANET 
[16,  17,  18],  mobile  nodes  act  as  routers  to  forward  packets;  they  also  exchange 
routing messages with each other to establish their routing tables. 
In general, a MANET is a trust-all-peers design, assuming that each node provides 
correct routing information and acts as a router to cooperatively forward packets. By 
exploiting these assumptions, a malicious node can easily corrupt the routing ability 
of the network by sending incorrect routing messages [14, 19]. An attacker can send 
incorrect  routing  messages  either  by  initiating  corrupt  packets  or  by  modifying

forwarded packets. Although cryptographic schemes can protect a forwarded packet 
from being modified, it can not prevent a node from initiating a packet with forged 
contents.  Therefore,  other  mechanisms  must  be  developed 
to  complement 
cryptographic approaches. 
Intrusion Detection (ID) is a viable approach to this problem, but current intrusion 
detection solutions in wired network cannot be directly applied to MANET because of 
new  challenges  in  MANET,  such  as  fully  distributed  audit  data,  limited  bandwidth, 
numerous unknown attacks, and insufficient local information for detectors. Recently, 
researchers  have  developed  distributed  Intrusion  Detection  Systems  (IDS)  for 
detecting  insider  attacks  in  MANET  [6,7,8,9,10,11,14,21].  However,  none  of  these 
IDS has a practical message exchange mechanism to supply sufficient data for their 
IDS.  The exchange of information between distributed detectors tends to have a high 
overhead, while MANET has limited resources. 
Our work has two major contributions for intrusion detection in MANET. First, we 
propose  a  practical  and  effective  message  exchange  model:  Distributed  Evidence-
driven  Message  Exchanging  intrusion  detection  Model  (DEMEM)  for  MANET. 
DEMEM  overcomes  the  challenge  of  distributed  detectors  in  MANET  without 
sufficient  data  to  detect  routing  attacks.  Instead  of  adopting  costly  promiscuous 
monitoring,  detectors  in  DEMEM  simply  intercept  routing  messages  and  validate 
these  routing  messages  for  detecting  routing  attacks.  Also,  DEMEM  segregates  the 
duties  of  security  agents  and  routing  services  to  avoid  modifying  the  routing 
protocols.  The  efficient  evidence-driven  message  exchange  mechanism  provides 
sufficient evidence in order to perform scalable distributed intrusion detection at each 
node. 
Second,  we  implement  DEMEM  in  a  proactive  routing  protocol  in  MANET, 
Optimal  Link  State  Routing  (OLSR)[16]  with  four  practical  assumptions,  and  three 
new proposed ID messages specifically for OLSR. DEMEM in OLSR uses detection 
constraints  in  our  previous  detection  model  proposed  in  RAID  2005[14].  The 
detection model shows that by validating consistency among related routing messages 
according  to  detection  constraints,  detectors  can  precisely  detect  both  known  and 
unknown  insider  routing  attacks  in  OLSR.  We  observe  that  if  detectors  within  two 
hops  can  exchange  their  routing  information,  they  will  have  sufficient  evidence  for 
constraints of intrusion detection. So we propose three ID messages for DEMEM in 
OLSR  to  resolve  critical  assumptions  of  previous  detection  models  and  provide 
essential  ID  message  exchange  service.  ID-Evidence  guarantees  each  detector  has 
sufficient  evidence  for  detection  constraints;  ID-Forward  triggers  the  selected 
forwarders sending ID-Evidence while the detector observes new evidence in order to 
minimize  message overhead, and ID-Request handles  message loss. Thus, DEMEM 
not  only  performs  practical,  scalable,  and  accurate  intrusion  detection  in  OLSR  but 
also  tolerates  message  loss  with  low  message  overhead.  In  addition,  DEMEM  is 
capable  of  being  applied  to  other  routing  protocols  in  MANET,  such  as  the  other 
famous  proactive  protocol,  Topology  Dissemination  Based  on  Reverse-Path 
Forwarding(TBRPF)[24],  and  two  popular  re-active  protocols,  Ad  Hoc  On  Demand 
Distance Vector (AODV)[18] and Dynamic Source Routing(DSR)[17] with different 
ID messages tailored for different protocols specifically. 
The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  compares  current 
IDS and cryptographic works with DEMEM. Section 3 discusses threats in MANET

and the challenges of developing IDS for MANET, especially the lack of an efficient 
message exchange framework among detectors. Section 4 presents the design of our 
proposed message exchange framework, DEMEM. Section 5 implements DEMEM in 
OLSR,  a  proactive  protocol  in  MANET,  Section  6  we  demonstrate  how  DEMEM 
detect  OLSR  routing  attacks  by  an  example  scenario  and  experiment  results  of 
DEMEM in OLSR from the simulation. In section 7, we discuss ongoing works and 
conclude in section 8. 
2   Related Works 
Intrusion  detection  systems  on  wired  network-based  have  generally  employed  two 
models: signature-based and anomaly-based approaches. A signature-based IDS[4,5] 
monitors activities on the networks and compares them with known attacks. However, 
a shortcoming of this approach is that new unknown threats cannot be detected. An 
anomaly-based  IDS [6,8,9,10,21] monitors  the network  traffic  and  compares  it  with 
normal  behavior  patterns  statistically.  The  issue  is  that  anomaly-based  approaches 
yield high false positives for a wired network. If we apply these statistical approaches 
to  MANET,  the  false  positive  problem  will  be  worse  because  of  the  unpredictable 
topology changes due to node mobility in MANETs. Various IDSs for wired networks 
have one characteristic in common: they have a centralized point that can aggregate 
all of the traffic for analysis. This centralized IDS structure is not feasible for a fully 
distributed  MANET.  To  resolve  this  lack  of  central  authority,  hierarchy  IDS  are 
proposed [6,7]. However, these hierarchy structures are only conceptual models that 
have  not  been  realized  yet  because  the  foreseen  cost  is  too  high.  Thus,  we  propose 
DEMEM as a practical and effective intrusion prevention approach with low message 
overhead for MANET. 
Several  proposals  [1,2,3]  use  cryptographic  techniques  to  secure  the  integrity  of 
routing  messages  in  MANET.  These  secure  protocols  have  three  drawbacks.  First, 
although  key  cryptography  can  protect  the  integrity  of  forwarded  packets,  it  cannot 
prevent  a  node  from  initiating  a  new  message  with  incorrect  information.  Second, 
these  secure  protocols  require  heavy  computation  and  key  distribution  involved  in 
public  key  cryptography.  These  computation  and  distribution  overheads  are  too 
expensive  for MANET as mobile nodes usually  have limited power and bandwidth. 
Finally,  these  cryptographic  schemes  are  still  vulnerable  to  malicious  insiders  who 
possess the keys to communicate in the network. 
Numerous IDSs proposed for various aspects of MANET threats are introduced as 
follows.  In  [8,9],  they  use  statistics-based  and  credit-based  approaches  to  address 
packet  dropping  problems  in  MANET,  respectively.  A  general  cooperative  IDS 
architecture for MANET was first proposed in [10] by Zhang and Lee. A cooperative 
specification-based IDS for AODV routing protocols is discussed in [11]. [12] talks 
about a secure link state routing  for MANET by attaching  certified keys to the link 
state  updates  flooded  within  a  specified  zone.  A  secure  OLSR  protocol  [13]  is 
developed to prevent replay attacks by using a timestamp to verify the freshness of a 
message.  The  advantage  of  DEMEM  is  that  DEMEM  only  intercepts  routing 
messages between the routing layer and the IP layer instead of modifying the routing 
protocol.  Therefore,  DEMEM  is  capable  of  supporting  other  MANET  routing 
protocols as well by specifying different rules for the specific target protocol.

3   Threats and Challenges of Intrusion Detection in MANET 
3.1   Threats in MANET 
Several studies have been done on the vulnerabilities of MANET protocols [14,15,19]. 
There  are  two  kinds  of  packets  transmitted  in  MANET:  routing  packets,  which  are 
used  for  maintaining  routes,  and  data  packets,  which  are 
the  actual  data 
communicated  between  source  and  destination.  In  general,  MANET  has  many 
intrinsic properties that make it more vulnerable to attacks than wired networks. First 
of all, every node in MANET functions as a router that is responsible for routing and 
packet delivery. If a node is compromised and exploits the cooperative nature among 
mobile nodes, the whole network will result in disasters, including incorrect routing 
topology and delivery failures. Second, all nodes in MANET share public channels in 
which  attackers  can  easily  target  any  victim  node  without  passing  through  physical 
protection 
is  dynamic  and 
unpredictable due to mobility. Finally, MANET is a fully distributed environment that 
lacks an authorized central point to validate message correctness. Because of the last 
two  vulnerabilities,  a  malicious  node  can  send  incorrect  routing  information  to  its 
surrounding  nodes  to  cause  routing  failures  without  being  noticed  by  others.  In 
designing  protocols,  assuming  that  every  node  will  send  correct  messages  and  that 
every node is cooperative to forward correct messages makes MANET susceptible to 
attacks.  It is obvious that a corrupt node can easily exploit these assumptions to break 
the cooperation of all nodes.

in  MANET 
3.2   Attack Model 
Routing  and  data  delivery  are  two  fundamental  services  in  MANET.  Attackers  can 
easily  disrupt  routing  topology  by  manipulating  routing  packets  to  cause  delivery 
failures  of  data packets.  According  to  fundamental  characteristics  of  attack  packets, 
we analyze these attacks in three categories: 
1.  Forge  initiated  routing  packets.  Attackers  can  disrupt  routing  tables  by 
initiating forged routing packets that are then broadcast to networks. The contents of 
the  initiated  routing  packets  are  usually  the  fundamental  bases  (for  example,  1-hop 
neighbor information) to build up routing topology. Unfortunately, forge routing data 
in  the  initiated  packets  will  propagate  through  flooding  and  thus  lead  to  routing 
failures due to corrupted routing topology. It is challenging to detect initiated routing 
packets with forge data because these forge packets follow the specification of routing 
protocols and thus have no difference from good packets. Cryptographic techniques 
that are used to authenticate the originators cannot detect initiated packets with forge 
contents because the attacker is the originator who signed the forge packets with legal 
keys. This type of attack uses atomic attack methods and can be manipulated by an 
attacker  to  launch  much  more  powerful  compound  attacks.  DEMEM  provides  IDS 
capabilities to detect this type of attack precisely. 
2.  Forge forwarded routing packets as well as node identity. Attackers can also 
disrupt  the  integrity  of  forwarded  routing  packets  by  modifying  the  contents  of 
packets passing through it. The attacker can also pretend that he has received some 
packet from others and then initiate a non-existing forwarded packet. Detection of this 
category  of  attacks  is  relatively  easy,  since  the  contents  of  forwarded  packets  must 
remain the same; cryptographic techniques can be used to protect the integrity of the

253 
forwarded packets as well as the node identity of all routing packets. Many secured 
routing protocols and cryptographic techniques have been developed to prevent this 
type of attack. However, most of them utilize RSA related algorithms, which require 
high  computation  and  may  cause  denial  of  service  attacks.  Timed  Efficient  Stream 
Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA) [22] is built on a one-way key chain technique 
using a symmetric key, which requires much less computation. DEMEM assumes that 
TESLA  authenticates  the  content  of forwarded  routing  packets  and  node  identity  to 
prevent this type of attack. This is also our ongoing work discussed in 7.1. 
3.  Drop  forwarded  packets.  A selfish node may drop packets routing through it. 
Unlike the previous two types of attacks, which may cause routing disaster by a single 
attacker, this kind of attack is relatively simple and less severe. If a selfish node drops 
a broadcast routing packet, the dropped packet may reach every node because of the 
flooding  nature.  Besides,  a  data  packet  drop  can  be  detected  if  the  sender  does  not 
receive an acknowledgement from the recipient in a reasonable time period. Several 
reputation-based works have been proposed to prevent a node from dropping packets 
intentionally [8][9].  
3.3   Challenges vs. Requirements of IDS in MANET 
Because of unique MANET features and limitations, developing IDS for MANET has 
many  difficult  challenges  that  differ  from  those  in  wired  networks.  First,  nodes  in 
MANET are expected to be honest routers that work cooperatively. A malicious node
