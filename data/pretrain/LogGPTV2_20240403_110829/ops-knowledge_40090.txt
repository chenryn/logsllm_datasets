I would like to check if there are any `.rar` files in a specific directory. The search does not need to be recursive.

Initially, I tried using a wildcard with `os.path.isfile()`, but it did not work. What would be a better approach?

**Response:**

Using `iglob` from the `glob` module is a better option in this case. Unlike `glob`, which returns a list of all matching files, `iglob` returns an iterator. This is more efficient if you only need to check for the existence of at least one `.rar` file, rather than generating a full list.

Here’s an example of how you can use `iglob` to achieve this:

```python
import glob

directory = '/path/to/your/directory'
rar_files = glob.iglob(f'{directory}/*.rar')

# Check if there is at least one .rar file
if next(rar_files, None) is not None:
    print("At least one .rar file exists in the directory.")
else:
    print("No .rar files found in the directory.")
```

This code will efficiently check for the presence of `.rar` files without needing to generate a full list, making it a more optimal solution for your needs.
