User: I'd like to check if there are any .rar files in a directory. It doesnâ€™t need to be recursive.
Using wildcard with os.path.isfile() was my best guess, but it doesn't work. What can I do then?
Assistant: iglob is better than glob here since you do not actually want the full list of rar files, but just want to check that one rar exists
