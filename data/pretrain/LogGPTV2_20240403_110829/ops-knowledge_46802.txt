Question: "You are tasked with performing security testing on a mobile application. During testing, you encounter SSL pinning which prevents you from intercepting traffic with a proxy. To proceed with dynamic analysis, you need to deactivate this defense. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate to address this challenge?"
 "A": "Implementing a multi-threaded anti-debugging control within the application to bypass SSL pinning."
 "B": "Utilizing code injection techniques to modify the SSL pinning logic at runtime."
 "C": "Applying a cryptographic white-box to encrypt traffic and circumvent SSL pinning."
 "D": "Reconfiguring the operating system's sandboxing features to ignore SSL pinning."
Answer: B
