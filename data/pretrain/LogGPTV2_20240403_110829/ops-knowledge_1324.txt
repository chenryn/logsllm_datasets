User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Putty connection error but RDC working fine [Windows 7] I wanted to establish a RDC from my Windows 7 machine to a remote server (Server version: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.4).

I followed and adapted the instructions from:
http://laptops.eng.uci.edu/software-installation/using-linux/how-to-configure-xming-putty

Now my RDC works perfectly, but I get the following error log when I try connecting with Putty:


  2018-05-08 14:58:00   Connecting to 192.168.20.209 port 22
  
  2018-05-08 14:58:00    We claim version: SSH-2.0-PuTTY_Release_0.70
  
  2018-05-08 14:58:00    Server version: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.4
  
  2018-05-08 14:58:00    Using SSH protocol version 2
  
  2018-05-08 14:58:00    Network error: Software caused connection abort


I cannot connect for sftp transfers with FileZilla, which is actually my main problem since I can connect to my server using RDC


  15:33:34   Response:   fzSftp started, protocol_version=8
  
  15:33:34   Error:  Network error: Software caused connection abort
  
  15:33:34   Error:  Could not connect to server


Any idea how to debug this weird situation ?

Thank you !

Assistant: The problem came from the fact that the keys generated on the first connection to the server were somehow not stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\SshHostKeys.
This is probably due to the RDC connection since it happened after I used it.

Following this guide https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-regenerate-openssh-host-keys/, I removed the old keys from the server and reconfigured Openssh server. While connecting to the server using Putty, the keys were shared and now Putty, RDC and Filezilla all work.
