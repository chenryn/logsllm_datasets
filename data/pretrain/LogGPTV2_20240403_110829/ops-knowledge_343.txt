Including computing power, storage resources, data processing and management and other services. Its core is to centrally manage data center resources and provide users with flexible and scalable computing capabilities. The deployment modes of cloud computing are divided into private cloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud. 1.

Cloud computing service models are divided into SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. 1. SaaS: Software as a service, providing complete application services. 2. PaaS: Platform as a service, providing a complete set of development, deployment, operation and maintenance platforms. 3. IaaS: Infrastructure as a service, providing basic resources such as physical machines, computing, networks, and data storage.
