I'm going to paste the irclogs as i'm not the person with the problem. But I
agree it is a problem.
The problem is that elasticsearch1.4.0-1.Beta1 is newer than 1.4.0. Requiring
you to --force the action.
    [15:45]  yum update says nothing to update, manual run of rpm update gives this - package
                         elasticsearch-1.4.0.Beta1-1.noarch (which is newer than elasticsearch-1.4.0-1.noarch) is already
                         installed
    [15:51]  audiphilth, you likely have to remove the beta
    [15:51]  to get to the release
    [15:51]  audiphilth, that or rpm -Uvh to it
    [15:51]  and grab the rpm
    [15:51]  audiphilth, likely better to force it by the command line than remove it heh

    [15:51]  ya, i grabbed the rpm and i get - package elasticsearch-1.4.0.Beta1-1.noarch (which is newer than
                         elasticsearch-1.4.0-1.noarch) is already installed
    [15:52]  not sure why it thinks the 1.4 beta is newer
    [15:53]  rpm -Uvh elasticsearch-1.4.0.noarch.rpm
    [15:53]  Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
    [15:53]          package elasticsearch-1.4.0.Beta1-1.noarch (which is newer than elasticsearch-1.4.0-1.noarch)
                         is already installed
    [15:53]  --force
    [15:53]  i think that works? or something similar
    [15:53]  that's crazy though
    [15:53]  oh 1.4.0-1
    [15:53]  vs 1.4.0
    [15:53]  geeze
    [15:53]  right, was hoping not to have to do that, i'll try and see
    [15:55]  --force works
    [15:55] --- MUCHAHASAQ is now known as edx
    [15:56]  well it appears the beta was a greater version
    [15:56]  so it makes sense
    [15:56]  can anyone shed light on the '_type' and 'type' fields? what is the difference?
    [15:57]  not sure how much sense it makes if the release ver. can be trumped by an *older* beta
    [16:01]  someone should file an issue on this
    [16:01]  so I think I will and just paste the irclogs
