## Abstract
Online email archives are a highly sensitive yet under-protected information resource. These archives can store years of personal and business emails in an easily accessible format, making them more vulnerable to compromise than messages in transit. Most email archives are protected by reusable passwords, which are often weak and easily compromised. To enhance the security of these archives, we propose a novel, user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive intrusion detection system (IDS). As a first step, we have developed a simple probabilistic model that correlates email senders with a user's email disposition. Our tests, using data from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, show a low rate of false positives (typically one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks. These results suggest that anomaly detection is a feasible strategy for securing email archives without requiring changes in user authentication or access behavior.

## 1. Introduction
Email is a fundamental application of the Internet, used daily by millions. However, it is also an extremely insecure medium for communication. Emails lack authentication, confidentiality, and integrity guarantees, and email servers are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. The spam epidemic has partly resulted from these weaknesses. In practice, though, email provides "sufficient" security, as a high percentage of legitimate emails reach their intended destinations intact, and confidential information is not often misused.

The spread of reliable network connectivity and the declining cost of storage have changed how email is managed, increasing the threats to users' inboxes. Previously, emails were typically downloaded to local or workgroup servers. Now, emails are more frequently archived on servers accessible via the Internet, either through a web interface or protocols like IMAP. This convenience comes at the cost of increased vulnerability, as anyone with access to the Internet can potentially access these archives. Remotely-accessible email servers, storing hundreds of megabytes of filtered, prioritized, and organized emails, provide adversaries with a means to learn about a target with minimal effort and risk. While most attackers lack the technical skill to intercept emails in transit, they can easily access Internet-connected email archives.

Despite the increased exposure, the authentication technology used to protect email archives remains weak. Reusable text passwords, which have been the standard since the early days of the Internet, are still widely used. Even when systems do not transmit passwords in cleartext, they can be compromised by malicious software, social engineering, or user negligence.

To address this challenge, our research focuses on better protecting email repositories even when account passwords are compromised. We propose using an IDS specifically designed for email archives. Unlike traditional IDSs, which focus on detecting software vulnerabilities, our system aims to detect unauthorized access using normal access protocols. This is similar to the "insider threat" problem, where the goal is to detect unusual uses of valid authentication credentials by maintaining statistical profiles of individual user behavior. Our proposed system is user-specific, controlled by the profiled user, who receives alarms and adjusts parameters, providing control over their level of security. If the data acquisition and analysis requirements are sufficiently small, such a system could scale to large email sites, even with a fixed per-user rate of false positives.

As a first step, we have developed and tested a simple statistical model based on the relationship between the disposition of new email messages and the senders of those emails. After training for approximately one month, our system can distinguish between variations in user behavior and simulated attacker behavior with a low rate of false positives (as low as one alarm per month, but generally not higher than one per week).

While our testing involves only a few users, the results suggest that our modeling strategy is viable. More importantly, it demonstrates the feasibility of online anomaly intrusion detection through observable user behavior. However, no single model will capture the patterns of all users. By developing multiple simple models and allowing the system to choose the most suitable one, it should be possible to accurately model the behavior of almost all email users and protect their archives from attack.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 outlines the motivation and requirements for an email archive IDS, Section 4 explains our choice of observables and modeling strategy, Section 5 presents experimental setup and results, and Section 6 concludes with a discussion of limitations, implications, and future work.

## 2. Related Work
Email, defined by its underlying protocol SMTP, offers almost no security guarantees. Various technical mechanisms have been proposed to address these limitations. Some, like PGP and S/MIME, use cryptography to provide end-to-end integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. More commonly, email security enhancements focus on unsolicited email (spam). Solutions include preventing the use of forged email senders, blocking known sources of spam, and content-based filtering. These approaches help secure individual messages but do not protect messages once they are delivered to a user’s inbox.

The problem of email archive security is often subsumed within the general host protection problem. Both server and client protection systems have been developed, including buffer overflow mitigation, intrusion detection systems, file integrity checkers, firewalls, and other protections. Client systems often employ these mechanisms along with tools to prevent virus and spyware compromise. However, these systems are primarily designed to prevent malicious software from circumventing access control policies, not to prevent the use of compromised authentication credentials.

Reusing passwords is a common practice, but it makes them vulnerable to dictionary attacks, malware, and human error. Users often share passwords across domains, and insiders may have motives to compromise a user’s privacy. Protection against insider attacks, which involve authorized accesses and manipulations of data, is difficult to achieve with traditional security technologies. Most insider-focused IDSs use anomaly detection, monitoring host audit records, typing patterns, and UNIX shell commands. These systems build models of individual user behavior but often suffer from high false positive rates due to the variability of human behavior.

While there has been no specific work on protecting email archives, the problem is analogous to the misuse of database information by insiders. Proposals like DEMIDS build profiles of how individual users access a given database. Email archives, being personal and well-structured, enable a simplified, specialized approach. The main challenge is determining what data to capture and how to represent it. The next section explains our approach.

## 3. Protecting Email Archives
To protect email archives from password disclosure, we propose a user-specific email archive IDS. Unlike host or network IDSs, which protect one or more computers, our system is designed to protect a single resource: a user’s email repository. Logically, an email archive server would run multiple IDS instances, one per user. This design is motivated by the personal nature of email and impacts the overall system architecture, modeling strategy, and scalability.

Our threat model assumes the attacker has access to the user’s hardware and software environment, including the user’s password. The targeted data is stored on a remote server, accessible via IMAP or a web email interface. The attacker has no administrative access to the server and aims to compromise the archive by violating confidentiality (reading old and new emails) and/or integrity (deleting, modifying, or inserting emails). Our goal is to detect the attacker’s actions before significant damage occurs.

To protect a user’s email archive, we need an IDS that can detect anomalous behavior relative to that of a legitimate user. Legitimate users have unique patterns of archive access, and what is normal for one user may be anomalous for another. Therefore, we approach this problem from the perspective of user behavior modeling. Most IDSs avoid focusing on user behavior due to the high false positive rates, but we believe that with careful adjustments, a persistent level of false positives can be managed.
