User: How to set the file permissions of the Linux system to ensure data security and privacy?
Assistant: In the Linux system, the access permissions of files or directories can be set through the chmod command. There are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute, corresponding to the numbers 1, 2, and 4, and the addition of numbers indicates the combination of permissions. For example, if the permission is rwxr-xr--, you can use the chmod command to set it to 755, namely: ``` chmod 755 filename ``` Among them, 7 means that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, and 5 means that the group and other users have read and write permissions. Execute permission, but no write permission. In addition to the chmod command, you can also use the chown and chgrp commands to change the user and user group to which the file belongs. In addition, access to files can be further restricted by setting ACL (Access Control List) under files and directories. ACL allows fine-grained granting of different access rights to multiple users or user groups. ACLs can be managed using the setfacl and getfacl commands. Generally speaking, setting file and directory permissions and ACL needs to comprehensively consider data security and privacy requirements, as well as system and application permissions requirements for files, and take flexible measures to ensure data security and privacy.
