User: Analyze the header information of an email, including sender, recipient, mail server and other information, and determine whether the email is spam.
Assistant: Email header information refers to the original information used to describe the email that is included before the email body when the email is sent. Email header information includes email subject, sender, receiver, and email server and other key information. The following is an example of mail header information: Return-Path: <sender@example.com> Received: from mail.example.com ([192.168.1.1]) by mx.example.com with ESMTP id abc123 for <recipient@example. net>; Fri, 05 Jun 2020 12:34:56 -0700 (PDT) Received: from localhost (localhost.localdomain [127.0.0.1]) by mail.example.com (Postfix) with ESMTP id def456 for <recipient@example .net>; Fri, 05 Jun 2020 12:34:56 -0700 (PDT) X-Virus-Scanned: Debian amavisd-new at mail.example.com Received: from mail.example.com ([127.0.0.1]) by localhost (mail.example.com [127.0.0.1]) (amavisd-new, port 10024) with ESMTP id ghi789 for <recipient@example.net>; Fri, 05 Jun 2020 12:34:56 -0700 (PDT) Received: from example.com (mail.example.com [203.0.113.2]) by mail.example.com (Postfix) with ESMTPS id jkl012 for <recipient@example.net>; Fri, 05 Jun 2020 12:34:56 -0700 (PDT) DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/simple; d=example.com; s=mail; t=1591394096; bh=abcdefg; h=From:To:Subject :Date; b=123456789abcdefg From: sender@example.com To: recipient@example.net Subject: Example Email Date: Fri, 05 Jun 2020 12:34:56 -0700 Message-ID: <hij123@example.com> Content -Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit The email header information contains a lot of key information: 1. Return-Path: Indicates the address to which the email is returned. Usually the reply-to address used by the final mail transfer proxy server. 2. Received: The path used to record the mail. This includes information such as mail servers, IP addresses, timestamps, and more. 3. X-Virus-Scanned: Indicates that the email has been scanned for viruses. 4. From: Indicates the sender address of the email. 5. To: Indicates the recipient address of the email. 6. Subject: Indicates the subject of the email. 7. Date: Indicates the time when the email was sent. 8. Message-ID: Indicates the unique identifier of the message. 9. Content-Type: Indicates the type of email content. 10. Content-Transfer-Encoding: Indicates the encoding method of the mail content. According to the above email header information, you can judge whether the email is spam: 1. Whether the sender's address is credible. 2. Whether the recipient address is correct. 3. Whether the sender and recipient match. 4. Whether the email subject is appropriate. 5. Whether the sending time is reasonable. If the above information is normal, you can judge that the email is not spam. However, spammers often provide false information to avoid rejection. Therefore, it is also necessary to make comprehensive judgments based on information such as content and attachments.
