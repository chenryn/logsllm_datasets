### Social Welfare Under Attack in DLC and Dynamic Pricing Systems

Figure 10 illustrates the social welfare under an attack in both Direct Load Control (DLC) and dynamic pricing systems. The dynamic pricing mechanism is less detrimental because it provides incentives to consumers, encouraging them to reduce their consumption. Additionally, Figure 10 shows the total amount of incentives granted to the population. Notably, the rewards and taxes are not balanced, necessitating external subsidies to sustain the Demand Response (DR) program. These subsidies can be seen as losses to the social planner due to the attack.

We conclude that dynamic pricing schemes are more resilient than DLC models because consumers do not bear all the losses; the majority of the losses are absorbed by the social planner (electric utility or DR company). In terms of system security, dynamic pricing schemes are incentive-compatible, placing the burden of losses on the entity better equipped to secure these systems rather than on the consumers.

### Malicious Attacker

We now consider an attacker whose goal is to cause damage to the power system by creating a sudden, unanticipated spike in electricity consumption. Even if the distribution system has protection mechanisms, a sudden spike that has not been forecasted will be difficult to protect against, potentially causing local blackouts (by tripping a distribution fuse or circuit breaker) or triggering blackstart generators.

#### Attack on DLC Models
Creating such a consequence with a DLC model is straightforward. Since the central entity controls electricity consumption signals, the attacker can directly send all consumption signals to their maximum value simultaneously. Unless consumers override the control commands, this will have a sudden and clear impact.

#### Attack on Dynamic Pricing Models
For the dynamic pricing model, the attack strategy is more complex, as agents make their optimization decisions individually, distributedly, and rationally.

The most intuitive but naive attack against dynamic pricing is to set a very low price for electricity (or provide high rewards) at the time when the highest demand is forecasted (typically in the evening). Let us denote this identified time as \( t_{\text{attack}} \). We assume the attacker can compromise the incentive signal and send the following malicious incentives:

\[
I_i(q_t) = 
\begin{cases} 
I_i(q_t) + \sigma_1 \|q\|_1 & \text{if } t = t_{\text{attack}}, \\
I_i(q_t) & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\]

where \(\sigma_1 > 0\) is a design parameter. This attack creates a sudden increase in incentives, leading to increased consumption at \( t_{\text{attack}} \). Note that this attack can be implemented without knowledge of individual consumer valuation functions.

However, this naive attack is not optimal for dynamic pricing schemes. Consumers can defer their electricity consumption during unfavorable market conditions and return to consuming en masse when conditions change abruptly. A strategic attack can be more effective by carefully increasing prices in the hours leading up to the attack, causing consumers to defer their consumption, and then immediately lowering prices to their lowest values at the attack time. This causes deferred loads to shift their consumption, accumulating the need to use electricity until the price is favorable.

The strategic attack is implemented with the following incentives:

\[
I_i(q_t) = 
\begin{cases} 
I_i(q_t) + \sigma_1 \|q\|_1 & \text{if } t = t_{\text{attack}}, \\
I_i(q_t) - \sigma_2 \|q\|_1 & \text{if } t \in [t_a, t_b], \\
I_i(q_t) & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\]

where \(\sigma_1\) and \(\sigma_2\) are positive real numbers, \([t_a, t_b]\) is the time period in which the attack focuses on reducing demand, and \( t_{\text{attack}} \) is the time at which the peak is caused, with \( t_a < t_b < t_{\text{attack}} \).

The fitness function (marginal utility) used for population dynamics of the \(i\)-th individual is:

\[
f_t^i(q) = 
\begin{cases} 
\left( \sum_{h=1}^N W_h(q) \right) + \sigma_1 & \text{if } t = t_{\text{attack}}, \\
\left( \sum_{h=1}^N W_h(q) \right) - \sigma_2 & \text{if } t \in [t_a, t_b], \\
\left( \sum_{h=1}^N W_h(q) \right) & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]

Parameters \(\sigma_1\) and \(\sigma_2\) either increase or decrease the marginal utility associated with consumption at different times of the day, allowing the attacker to deceive users into deferring consumption during \([t_a, t_b]\) and increasing consumption at \( t_{\text{attack}} \).

Simulations are conducted with \(\sigma_1 = 50\), \(\sigma_2 = 100\), \( t_a = 0 \) hrs, \( t_b = 17 \) hrs, and \( t_{\text{attack}} = 20 \) hrs. The attack time coincides with the demand peak in the Pareto optimal outcome.

Figure 11 shows the impact of both the naive and strategic attacks after the attack is launched. The naive attack succeeds in causing a demand increase at \( t_{\text{attack}} \), but its main impact is limited to that time. The strategic attack achieves a greater peak by causing demand reduction prior to the attack, setting conditions so that the population has more resources to consume when prices are low.

### Conclusions and Future Work

We introduced two new attack models for DR programs, where attackers are strategic adversaries with clearly defined goals. We proved the optimality of fraud strategies for attacks against DR with DLC and an optimality property of the fraudster attack against DR with dynamic pricing. We also showed that dynamic pricing is more resilient to attacks than DLC mechanisms.

Additionally, we introduced population dynamics to model the transient behavior of DR systems, particularly with consumers who can defer electricity consumption based on incentives. We demonstrated how this behavior can be exploited by malicious attackers to cause a sudden spike in electricity load. We introduced two threat scenarios and showed that a strategic attack can perform better than initial intuitive attacks. In practice, we believe this is the worst possible attack to the power distribution system, as utilities will not be able to forecast and plan contingencies for these orchestrated changes.

The main goal of this work was to understand the vulnerability of DR systems to market manipulators with access to control signals sent by the central authority to consumers.

In future work, we plan to study mechanisms to improve the security of these systems and minimize the effects of attacks. One interesting problem would be to design anomaly detection schemes to detect fraudsters (depending on the parameters \(\gamma\) and \(\lambda\)), and then evaluate them against fraudsters who try to maximize their gains while avoiding detection.

While our DR models are an improvement over previous work studying the security of DR systems, the accuracy of our analysis for practical applications will still depend on how well our DR models match real deployed systems. As we continue to deploy trial DR systems worldwide, we will obtain more data on several properties of the models, such as the average elasticity of electricity consumption and the effectiveness of incentives in controlling overall electricity load.
