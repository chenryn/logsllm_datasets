Fig. 10 shows the social welfare under an attack in both
DLC and dynamic pricing systems. The attack is less detri-
mental with a dynamic pricing mechanism because the social
planner provides incentives to consumers that reduce their
consumption. Fig. 10 also shows the total amount of incen-
tives granted to the population; in particular, the rewards
and taxes are not in balance, and consequently, the sys-
tem requires external subsidies to sustain the DR program.
Therefore, these subsidies can be seen as losses to the social
planner caused by the attack.
We can conclude that dynamic pricing schemes are more
resilient than DLC models because consumers do not have
to bear all the looses; the majority of the losses are taken by
the social planner (electric utility of DR company). There-
fore, in terms of securing the systems, we can say that dy-
namic pricing schemes are incentive-compatible by placing
the burden of the losses to the entity that knows better how
to secure these systems, rather than placing the burden of
the attack on consumers.
5. MALICIOUS ATTACKER
We now consider an attacker whose goal is to cause dam-
age to the power system, and in order to do that it tries

fare utility and global incentives as a function of the
attack severity λ for both the DLC and dynamic
pricing schemes with γ = 0.01.
to create a sudden (unanticipated) spike in electricity con-
sumption. Even if the distribution system has protection
mechanisms, a sudden spike that has not been forecasted
will be very diﬃcult to protect against, and it might cause
local blackouts (by tripping a distribution fuse or circuit
breaker) or kickstarting blackstart generators.
Creating this consequence with a DLC model is straight-
forward, since in a DLC model the central entity controls
electricity consumption signals, the attacker can directly
send all electricity consumption signals to their maximum
value at the same time instant. Unless consumers somehow
override the control commands to increase electricity con-
sumption, this will have a sudden and clear impact.
For the dynamic pricing model the attack strategy is not
that easy, as agents make their optimization in an individual,
distributed, and rational way.
Following the basic idea behind the attack to DLC models,
the most intuitive (but naive) attack against dynamic pric-
ing is to select a very low price for electricity (give rewards

the time where the highest forecast of demand is set to hap-
pen (typically in the evening). Let us called the identiﬁed
time for the sudden electricity consumption spike tattack.
We assume that the attacker is able to compromise the
incentive signal and send the following malicious incentives:
(cid:26)Ii(qt) + σ1||q||1
Ii(qt)
I m
i (q) =
if t = tattack,
otherwise,
where σ1 > 0 is a design parameter. This attack creates a
sudden increase in the incentives. As a consequence, the con-
sumption of the population will increase at tattack. Again,
because this attack takes place in the distributed optimiza-
tion setting, note that the attack can be implemented with-
out information of the valuation functions by each consumer.
We now show how the previous intuitive (but naive) at-
tack, is not optimal for dynamic pricing schemes. In partic-
ular, dynamic pricing models consumers that can defer the
consumption of electricity when market conditions are un-
favorable but then return to consuming electricity en masse
when market conditions change abruptly (in this case this
sudden shift in market conditions is created by the malicious
attacker).
A strategic attack can be implemented by carefully in-
creasing the prices of electricity in hours previous to the at-
tack (so consumers start deferring electricity consumption to
a later time), and then, at the time where the attacker wants
to create the spike of consumption, immediately lowering the
prices of electricity to their lowest values. This attack causes
loads that can be deferred to shift their consumption to a
later time, accumulating the need to use electricity until the
price is favorable.
The attack is implemented with the following incentives:
Ii(qt) + σ1||q||1
Ii(qt) − σ2||q||1
Ii(qt)
I m
i (q) =
if t = tattack,
if t ∈ [ta, tb],
otherwise,
where σi are positive real numbers, [ta, tb] is the time period
in which the attack focuses on reducing the demand, and
tattack is the time at which the peak is caused, with ta <
tb < tattack.
In this case, the ﬁtness function (marginal utility) used
for population dynamics (to model the transient evolution
of the behavior of market participants) of the ith individual
is:
(cid:16)(cid:80)N
(cid:16)(cid:80)N

,
f t
i (q) =
if t = tattack,
if t ∈ [ta, tb],
otherwise,
Note that the parameters σ1 and σ2 either increase or de-
crease the marginal utility associated with a consumption
at diﬀerent times of the day. Thus, the attacker can de-
ceive users by making them believe that it is not convenient
to allocate resources (consume electricity) during [ta, tb].
Also, the attacker can increase the consumption at tattack
by spreading the belief that users can increase their utility
by using more resources at that time.
Simulations are made with σ1 = 50, σ2 = 100, ta = 0hrs,
tb = 17hrs, tattack = 20hrs. In particular, the attack time
coincides with the demand peak in the Pareto optimal out-
come.
Fig. 11 shows the impact of both the naive and the strate-
gic attack after the attack is launched, that is, during the
initial transition period. In particular, the naive attack suc-
ceeds in causing an increase of the demand at tattack. How-
ever, the main impact of the attack is produced only during

hours of the day.
tattack. On the other hand, the strategic attack achieves a
greater peak by causing demand reduction prior to the at-
tack. Roughly speaking, the strategic attack sets conditions
so that the population has more resources to consume when
prices are low.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have introduced two new attack models for DR pro-
grams. In contrast to previous work, our attackers are strate-
gic adversaries with clearly deﬁned goals (objective func-
tions), furthermore we proved the optimality of the fraud
strategies for attacks against DR with DLC, and proved an
optimality property of the fraudster attack against DR with
dynamic pricing. We also showed how dynamic pricing is
more resilient to attacks than DLC mechanisms.
In addition we introduced population dynamics to model
the transient behavior of DR systems and in particular, cre-
ated a model with consumers that can defer the consumption
of electricity based on incentives. We showed how this be-
havior can be exploited by malicious attackers to cause a
sudden spike in electricity load. We introduced two threat
scenarios and showed that a strategic attack can perform
better than the initial intuitive attacks. In practice we be-
lieve that this is the worst possible attack to the power dis-
tribution system as utilities will not be able to forecast (and
therefore plan contingencies to) these changes orchestrated
by attackers.
The main goal of this work was to understand the vulner-
ability of DR systems to market manipulators with access
to the control signals sent by the central authority to con-
sumers.
In future work we plan to study mechanisms to
improve the security of these systems and to minimize the
eﬀects of attacks.
One interesting problem would be to design anomaly de-
tection schemes to detect fraudsters (depending on the pa-
rameters γ and λ), and then evaluate them against fraud-
sters that will try to maximize their gains while avoiding
detection.
While our DR models are an improvement over previous
work studying the security of DR systems; the accuracy of
our analysis for practical applications will still depend on
how well our DR models match real deployed systems. As
