ABSTRACT
Today’s inter-domain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Proto-
col (BGP), is increasingly complicated and fragile due to policy
misconﬁguration by individual autonomous systems (ASes). Ex-
isting conﬁguration analysis techniques are either manual and te-
dious, or do not scale beyond a small number of nodes due to
the state explosion problem. To aid the diagnosis of misconﬁgu-
rations in real-world large BGP systems, this paper presents BG-
PVerif , a reduction based analysis toolkit. The key idea is to
reduce BGP system size prior to analysis while preserving cru-
cial correctness properties. BGPVerif consists of two components,
NetReducer that simpliﬁes BGP conﬁgurations, and NetAnalyzer
that automatically detects routing oscillation. BGPVerif accepts a
wide range of BGP conﬁguration inputs ranging from real-world
traces (Rocketfuel network topologies), randomly generated BGP
networks (GT-ITM), Cisco conﬁguration guidelines, as well as ar-
bitrary user-deﬁned networks. BGPVerif illustrates the applicabil-
ity, efﬁciency, and beneﬁts of the reduction technique, it also in-
troduces an infrastructure that enables networking researchers to
interact with advanced formal method tool.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet today runs on a complex routing protocol called
the Border Gateway Protocol or BGP for short. BGP enables au-
tonomous systems (ASes) worldwide to achieve global connectiv-
ity, subject to each system’s local policy (what paths are allowed,
and the route preference used to select best paths). The conver-
gence behavior of the global Internet depends on how each ISP
conﬁgures its policy. Prior work has shown that policy misconﬁg-
urations can lead to route oscillation and slow convergence [2].
While our understanding of BGP safety has improved dramati-
cally in the past decade, there is a lack of automated tools that can

aid in the safety analysis process. Analysis today either consists of
manual proofs and counter-examples on small instances, or custom
simulators that are unable to explore the full protocol state space.
In this demonstration, we present BGPVerif, a formal analysis
toolkit that enables networking researchers to study and analyze
large BGP systems in a sound and automatic fashion. BGPVerif
consists of two components. NetAnalyzer [10] is an automated
analysis toolkit based on the Maude rewriting logic engine [4]. In
NetAnalyzer, the BGP system is encoded as a transition system
driven by rewriting rules. Maude’s high-performance rewriting en-
gine is used to analyze BGP instances automatically, by simulating
execution runs, as well as exhaustively exploring all execution runs
for possible divergence.
While automated, NetAnalyzer is susceptible to the state ex-
plosion problem as the number of nodes increases. The NetRe-
ducer component applies a novel reduction theory [9, 8] for re-
ducing BGP network size while preserving convergence properties.
In combination, NetAnalyzer and NetReducer enable BGPVerif to
perform safety analysis efﬁciently, often completing the analysis on
large networks that would otherwise not be possible to study within
reasonable time.
2. OVERVIEW
As shown in Figure 1, BGPVerif takes as input the conﬁgura-
tion of a BGP system, which includes the network topology and
routing policies for all routers. Policies include routing ﬁlters and
preferences based on path attributes. BGPVerif converts this con-
ﬁguration to an Extended Path Digraph (EPD) [8] instance, an in-
ternal representation used by BGPVerif to perform the reduction.
The EPD structure includes an explicit representation of both the
network topology and the preference-induced dependencies among
paths. EPD extends prior models [1, 6], and provides a basis for
reducing instances prior to analysis [9].
Given the EPD representation of the BGP system, the NetRe-
ducer component ﬁrst performs a reduction to output the reduced
EPD. The basic idea of reduction is straightforward: to simplify
the BGP system of interest, one repeatedly merges all pairs of
nodes where the merger does not affect the convergence behav-
ior of the entire network. There are two rules for identifying such
node pairs, and each of them only requires checking of local policy
details. (1) Duplicate reduction merges two nodes whose routing
conﬁgurations agree upon what paths and route preferences they
learned from their neighbors. (2) Complementary reduction merges
two nodes whose neighbors agree upon the paths and preferences
learned from them.
In our demonstration prototype, reduction can perform reduction
in two modes: (1) In batch mode, BGPVerif repeatedly merges all
reducible nodes and outputs the ﬁnal reduced BGP system in the
89form of a EPD; (2) Alternatively, in the interactive mode, BGPVerif
allows the user to select which nodes to try to reduce.
Figure 1: BGPVerif System Overview.
Finally, given a BGP conﬁguration’s EPD (either before or af-
ter reduction), the NetAnalyzer component uses the Maude ana-
lyzer [10, 9, 3] to classify the conﬁguration as either convergent or
oscillatory, and the oscillation as either transient or permanent.
existing nodes. She can also add a new router in a chosen place by
deliberately making it duplicate or complementary with an existing
node.
NetAnalyzer: Detect Route Oscillations.
NetAnalyzer provides an interactive graphical interface for net-
working researchers to make use of the formal analyses imple-
mented in Maude [10, 9, 3].
It allows the user to analyze BGP
conﬁgurations using reduction techniques that accelerate analysis
by orders of magnitude, enabling automated analysis of conﬁgura-
tions that could not previously be handled.
NetAnalyzer utilizes Maude’s built-in exhaustive search ability
and adds library support for detecting BGP oscillations. Our li-
brary allows us to exhaustively search all execution runs to detect
route oscillation. On termination, NetAnalyzer can correctly clas-
sify a BGP conﬁguration as either safe (no oscillations in any pro-
tocol runs), transient oscillation (route oscillation happens in some
execution traces), or permanent oscillation (convergence is impos-
sible).

4. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
BGPVerif provides a graphical user interface for the user to spec-
ify BGP conﬁguration inputs, and invoke reduction or analysis.
The interface embeds a visualizer that demonstrates the dynamic
reduction process as a transformation of the network topology aug-
mented with routing policies. In the back-end, BGPVerif includes
the reduction engine NetReducer and the analysis engine NetAn-
alyzer based on Maude. NetReducer is responsible for computing
the internal EPD representation, and performing the actual reduc-
tion, whereas NetAnalyzer extends Maude with additional library
support for detecting route oscillations in BGP systems.

In the BGPVerif GUI, the user inputs the topology and policy of
the BGP conﬁguration of interest, or selects a conﬁguration already
provided. The user can edit these pre-speciﬁed conﬁgurations as
well. The built-in network topologies include real world Rocket-
fuel data [7], and randomly generated networks using GT-ITM [5],
which is controlled by the input parameters. The built-in routing
policies include standard iBGP conﬁgurations such as full mesh,
route reﬂection and confederations [11].
Once the BGP system conﬁguration is loaded, BGPVerif gener-
ates the internal EPD representation by running BGP in a special
mode that deduces all possible paths and their relative preferences.
The user can now choose batch or interactive reduce
commands from NetReducer, or the analyze command of Ne-
tAnalyzer.
NetReducer: Simplify BGP Systems.
In batch mode, NetReducer will try all combinations of nodes
to see which are reducible. This makes the batch mode useful as
an automated step prior to analysis. In the ﬁne-grained interactive
mode, the user can specify either one or two nodes that she wants
to merge. The NetReducer can check whether a given pair of nodes
is indeed reducible; or, given only a single node, can search for a
second node to form a reducible pair. The interactive mode pro-
vides insights into convergence behavior even without a following
analysis operation.
Consider the scenario where a network operation would like to
expand her BGP system by adding new routers, without changing
the convergence behavior. Rather than analyzing the two BGP sys-
tems before and after migration separately, she can instead incre-
mentally grow the BGP network size while preserving convergence
throughout. At each step, the operator adds a node, and by interac-
tive reduction, she can decide if it can be merged with any of the
