 **Greg Wiley** opened **SPR-3519** and commented
Using the AspectJ annotation configuration method.
If two advice apply to the same join point and the lower-priority advice has
(non JP) parameters, those parameters will not be bound.
This occurs in Spring 2.0.5 but not in Spring 2.0.2.
Only jars on the CP are those in the -with-dependencies Spring distribution.
\spring-framework-2.0.5\lib\aspectj\aspectjrt.jar  
\spring-framework-2.0.5\lib\aspectj\aspectjweaver.jar  
\spring-framework-2.0.5\lib\asm\asm-2.2.3.jar  
\spring-framework-2.0.5\dist\spring-aspects.jar  
\spring-framework-2.0.5\dist\spring.jar  
\spring-framework-2.0.5\lib\jakarta-commons\commons-logging.jar  
\spring-framework-2.0.5\lib\asm\asm-commons-2.2.3.jar  
\spring-framework-2.0.5\lib\asm\asm-util-2.2.3.jar
Demonstration spike attached.
Note that in the demonstration, the exception can be eliminated by either:
  1. removing one of the advice classes from the configuration
  2. re-ordering the advice (so that the non-arg advice is lower priority)
  3. switching to Spring 2.0.2
This problem has been documented by others in the Spring forums.
