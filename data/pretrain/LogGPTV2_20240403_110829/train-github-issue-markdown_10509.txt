Both rule and cost query planners implement
    MATCH n
    WHERE n:Male
    RETURN n
with a `NodeByLabelScan` and not with an `AllNodesScan` plus a filter on the
label. I therefore would expect
    MATCH n
    WHERE n:Male OR n:Female
    RETURN n
to be implemented with two `NodeByLabelScan`'s. Instead both planners use an
`AllNodesScan` and then a filter.
For a simple label disjunction like this, would it not be possible and prudent
for the planners to implement the query with label scans?
