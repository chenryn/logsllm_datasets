### Title: Black Hat EU-22: Fail Harder: Finding Critical 0-Days Despite Our Mistakes

Vulnerability researchers and bug hunters often highlight their successful journeys to discovering critical vulnerabilities. However, the real story is rarely as straightforward as the ones shared on stage. In reality, failure, combined with a healthy dose of persistence, often leads to significant breakthroughs. This session will delve into the numerous setbacks and challenges that preceded the discovery of critical zero-day vulnerabilities across multiple projects. 

Join us to learn how to "fail harder" and witness two hackers openly discuss their technical missteps, while playfully ribbing each other about their mistakes. We will also share the lucky breakthroughs and moments of insight that ultimately led to success. Instead of struggling alone, take this opportunity to learn from our failures and transform your frustrations into a more productive and enjoyable experience.
