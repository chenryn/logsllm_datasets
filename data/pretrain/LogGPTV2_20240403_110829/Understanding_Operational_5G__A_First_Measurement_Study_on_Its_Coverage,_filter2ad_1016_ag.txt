eNB will select the T-eNB among them. In particular, the selecting
criterion triggered by the A3 event is that the channel quality gap

hand-off request (by an LTE MAC RACH trigger message), and
the T-eNB will enter an admission control cycle to respond the
hand-off. If the request is permitted, the T-eNB will feedback an
ACK to the S-eNB. Afterwards, the S-eNB initializes the hand-off
operations, including releasing the source 5G radio connection,
transmitting an RRC connection reconfiguration and performing
link synchronization with T-eNB, etc. Note that for 5G-5G hand-off,
the T-gNB must board a 4G master eNB, which is accomplished by
the signal exchanges as marked by green dotted lines.

A 5G HAND-OFF PROCEDURE
Here we provide some background about the types and trigger
conditions of hand-off events. Once a mobile phone leaves the cov-
erage area of one cell (serving cell), it should connect to another
cell (neighboring auxiliary cell) to avoid link outage. The proce-
dure is realized through the measurement report (MR) signaling.
B 5G POWER MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE
5G NSA has two states for Radio Resource Control (RRC), i.e.,
RRC_IDLE and RRC_CON N ECT ED in Rel-15 TS 36.331 and
38.331[11, 12], which operates following the state machine in
Fig. 25: (i) A 5G radio on UEs initializes from the RRC_IDLE state.
Once the UE has a packet to transmit, it will send a RRC connection
request to the eNB and enter the RRC_CON N ECT ED state for
TLT E_pro. (ii) At RRC_CON N ECT ED state, the UE can be in one
of the two modes - the LTE connection or the NR connection.
Specific to the NSA architecture, a 5G radio must go through
the 4G LTE mode (T4r_5r ) before reaching the 5G NSA NR mode
(TN R_pro). The switch from LTE to NR is natural, as long as the
phone supports 5G. Inside the RRC state machine, the UE usually
adopts the discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism for power
saving: The UE remains in sleep mode by default and only wakes
up and listens to the channel for a short Ton, at the beginning
of each periodic interval Tcycle. There are three DRX cycles in

Hand-off Event Description
When the signal quality of the serving cell is higher than a fixed threshold, it will tell the mobile phone
not to detect other auxiliary cells’ service quality, so that the mobile phone can save energy consumption.
When the signal quality of the serving cell is lower than a fixed threshold, it will tell the mobile phone
to start detecting other auxiliary cells’ service quality.
The signal quality of the neighboring cell is continuously higher than that of the serving cell within an offset
for a certain period. This is the main hand-off event.
The signal quality of one neighboring cell is higher than a fixed threshold.
The signal quality of the serving cell is lower than a predefined threshold (threshold1),
while that of the neighboring cell is higher than the other threshold (threshold2).
The signal quality of the heterogeneous radio access technology (RAT, like 4G and 5G) cell is better than a fixed threshold.
The signal quality of the serving cell is lower than threshold1, while the heterogeneous RAT cell is higher than threshold2.

common DRX scheme [42], i.e., paging DRX, short C-DRX and
long C-DRX. In our measurement, we only identify the paging
DRX and long C-DRX, but no short C-DRX in the ISP’s configu-
ration. (iii) If no more data is received for a period of time (Tinac)
during the RRC_CON N ECT ED state, the radio will return to the
RRC_IDLE state after Ttail waiting time. Notably, Rel-15 38.331
[12] has add a new state (RRC_I N ACT IV E) to the forthcoming
5G SA architecture to save the context information of the last
switch from RRC_CON N ECT ED to RRC_IDLE, which will enable
a rapid bridge from its reversion, so as to trade off the data transfer
response and more energy saving. We enumerate a list of NR radio
energy related parameters, observed in XCAL-Mobile, in Tab. 7.
