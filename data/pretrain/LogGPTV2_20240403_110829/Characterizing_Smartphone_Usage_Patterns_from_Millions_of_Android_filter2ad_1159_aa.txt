ABSTRACT
The prevalence of smart devices has promoted the popular-
ity of mobile applications (a.k.a. apps) in recent years. A
number of interesting and important questions remain unan-
swered, such as why a user likes/dislikes an app, how an app
becomes popular or eventually perishes, how a user selects
apps to install and interacts with them, how frequently an
app is used and how much traﬃc it generates, etc. This
paper presents an empirical analysis of app usage behaviors
collected from millions of users of Wandoujia, a leading An-
droid app marketplace in China. The dataset covers two
types of user behaviors of using over 0.2 million Android
apps, including (1) app management activities (i.e., installa-
tion, updating, and uninstallation) of over 0.8 million unique
users and (2) app network traﬃc from over 2 million unique
users. We explore multiple aspects of such behavior data
and present interesting patterns of app usage. The results
provide many useful implications to the developers, users,
and disseminators of mobile apps.

INTRODUCTION
The release of iPhone in 2007 has opened a new era of
mobile computing. Eight years later, smart devices such as
iPhones and Android devices have played an indispensable
role in our daily lives. The increasing popularity of mobile
devices and apps has induced an evolution of software in-
dustry. The emergence of online marketplaces and platform
APIs has been a game changer to developers, market in-
termediaries, and consumers, making them more and more
willing to develop, disseminate, and use mobile apps rather
than Web-based services [24].
The prevalence of mobile apps has also generated a huge
volume of app usage data. Understanding user behaviors
of using mobile apps is meaningful to all the stakeholders
mentioned above. For example, marketplace operators can
identify popular or problematic apps and provide eﬀective
app recommender systems; developers can understand why
their apps are liked or disliked by the users and therefore
improve the app design; end-users can have a better knowl-
edge of how particular apps are consuming their time and
bandwidth, and therefore optimize their decisions of select-
ing apps. Due to the lack of a sizable repository of such
behavioral data, most of these important questions remain
unanswered.
Previous studies have shown evidence about diﬀerent users
having diﬀerent patterns of using mobile apps [19, 23, 7, 1].
Most of these studies were conducted using rather small be-
havior datasets, typically collected from a small number of
student volunteers. The analyses also suﬀer from various
selection biases introduced by college students.
Moreover, most behavioral signals were collected through
a monitoring app voluntarily installed on the subjects’ de-
vices. Such a design is diﬃcult to be applied by the variety
of crowd due to the security and privacy concerns. As a
result, very few studies could scale up to millions of users.
We present a comprehensive analysis of app usage behav-
iors collected from millions of Android users1. Our data
comes from a leading Android app marketplace in China,

erators in China, such as Baidu, 360Safe, and Tencent, Wan-
doujia provides its own management app that facilitates
users to search, browse, download, install, update, and unin-
stall apps. Once being launched, the Wandoujia manage-
ment app runs as a background system-level service without
requiring the “root” privilege. It also provides the user op-
tion to collect network activity information of each app on
device, e.g., data traﬃc and access time under diﬀerent net-
works.
The dataset that we study covers over 0.2 million (260,172)
Android apps. The data mainly contains two types of user
behaviors: (1) app management activities (i.e., installation,
updating, and uninstallation) of over 0.8 million (8,112,145)
unique users; (2) app network usage of 2 million (2,031,007)
unique users. Based on this dataset, we conduct a system-
atic descriptive analysis that includes the distributions of
app popularity, possible reasons of app selection, life cycles
of abandoned apps, ﬁne-grained network analysis of apps,
and the impact of economic factors on app usage.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst de-
scriptive analysis of millions of users of Android market-
places. Although most users are Chinese, the usage pat-
terns learned from the millions could generalize to other
populations. Based on such a new dataset, we not only
validate some conclusions from previous eﬀorts, but also ex-
plore some new knowledge of user behaviors on app usage.
The paper aims to answer the following questions:
• How can we characterize the app popularity
among millions of users? Compared to previous
studies that mainly investigated app popularity by down-
loads [17], we explore the app popularity from vari-
ous aspects, including the monthly downloads of an
app, the number of unique devices an app was in-
stalled on, the network traﬃc of an app, and the net-
work access time of an app. Distributions of all these
aspects comply with the Pareto principle [14], i.e., a
small portion of apps account for substantial popular-
ity. These ﬁndings can help marketplace operators and
network providers improve their workloads for serving
the most popular apps, and organize eﬃcient caching
or prefetching mechanisms to enable fast downloads
and delivery of these popular apps.
• How do mobile users choose and manage apps?
Compared to previous studies that usually examined
the co-installed apps [24, 17], we further explore why
the apps are installed and how soon they are likely to
be uninstalled. We try to understand the possible rea-
sons for co-installing apps, i.e., apps provided by the
same vendor/developer or with similar functional-
ities are more likely to be installed together. We ﬁrst
study the uninstallation patterns of apps by devising a
new metric called the temporal installation/uninstallation
ratio to indicate how much an app is likely to be aban-
doned. These ﬁndings can help app marketplace oper-
ators improve their recommendation systems.
• How do diﬀerent apps perform in network ac-
tivity? Compared to previous studies [25, 24, 7], our
network analysis is conducted at ﬁne granularity. We
2http://www.wandoujia.com
study the network activities in terms of the data traﬃc
and the access time under Wi-Fi and cellular, respec-
tively. We further investigate where the network activ-
ity occurs (foreground or background). Besides iden-
tifying some “network intensive” apps, we ﬁnd apps
that may “suspiciously” keep continuous network con-
nections or consume traﬃc at the background. For
example, it is surprising that some tools, such as ﬂash-
light apps and namecard apps, generate unexpected
background traﬃc against their main purposes. We
are also surprised to ﬁnd that a large number of apps
keep long-lived TCP connections at the background
after they are launched. These ﬁndings can help mar-
ketplace operators to locate some “problematic” apps,
and help users choose alternative apps to reduce po-
tential threats caused by these apps.
• How do economic factors aﬀect app selection
and network usage? Compared to previous stud-
ies that relied on free/paid apps to measure economic
factors [23], our study is performed in a quite diﬀerent
way. Based on the hypothesis that the price of a device
model can reﬂect the user’s ﬁnancial background, we
classify users into diﬀerent groups according to their
device models. We make the ﬁrst report on how device
models impact the apps selection and data traﬃc, e.g.,
users with lower-end device models tend to use local
or less network-intensive apps. Based on our ﬁndings,
app marketplace operators can make more accurate
app recommendations, and app developers can target
speciﬁc user groups to optimize user experiences.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the dataset. Sections 3-6 describe the in-
ferred app usage patterns in four aspects, app popularity
patterns, management patterns, network patterns, and price-
sensitive patterns, respectively. Section 7 summarizes the
ﬁndings and implications to diﬀerent stakeholders. Section
8 discusses the threats to validity. Section 9 makes com-
parisons with related work, and Section 10 concludes the
paper.
2. DATASET
In this section, we brieﬂy introduce the Wandoujia mar-
ketplace and describe the features of our dataset collected
by the Wandoujia management app. To protect the user pri-
vacy and assure the ethnics of our research, we also discuss
how the data is processed.
2.1 Wandoujia
Our data is from Wandoujia3, a free Android app mar-
ketplace in China. Wandoujia was founded in 2009 and has
grown to be a leading Android app marketplace. Like other
marketplaces, third-party app developers can upload their
apps to Wandoujia and get them published after authen-
ticated. Compared to other marketplaces such as Google
Play, apps on Wandoujia are all free, although some apps
can still support “in-app purchase”.
Users have two channels to access the Wandoujia market-
place, either from the Web portal, or from the Wandoujia
management app. The Wandoujia management app is a na-
tive Android app, by which people can manage their apps,

lation counter is automatically increased by one and a log
entry of this activity is created. The logs of uninstallation
via the Wandoujia management app are processed in a sim-
ilar way. In the Wandoujia management app, collecting app
management activities is always enabled.
In our one-month data, we collected the management ac-
tivity logs from 8,112,145 unique users (devices in fact).
We denote the dataset as “Universal User Set”. The logs
of management activities are used to explore an app’s pop-
ularity, and can implicitly reﬂect the app’s quality.
2.2.2 Network Activities
When the advanced features are enabled, the Wandoujia
management app collects daily network statistics of each
app, if the app generates network connections either from
Wi-Fi or cellular (2G/3G/LTE). However, if an app is never
launched or generates no network connections, the app is
not recorded in the network statistic logs.
To reduce the overhead of runtime monitoring, the Wan-
doujia management app does not record network details of
each session of an app.
Instead, it summarizes the total
daily traﬃc and access time of an app by examining ﬂows
at the TCP level. The traﬃc and access time are captured
for Wi-Fi and cellular, respectively.
In particular, the traﬃc and access time generated from
foreground and background are treated separately. The
Wandoujia management app determines whether an app
is running at “foreground” by probing the Android system
stack for every 2 seconds.
In this way, the “foreground”
access time can imply how long the user interacts with an
app. The Wandoujia management app checks whether an
app running at “background” every 2 minutes. If any net-
work activity is detected during this interval, this app is
regarded to be “online” and its “background” access time is
increased by 2 minutes. Such time interval is reasonable to
initiate and release a TCP connection.
In summary, the statistic of network activity provides 8
combinations of information, i.e., 2 metrics (access time
and traﬃc) * 2 modes (Wi-Fi and Cellular) * 2 states (fore-
ground and background).
As the statistic of network activity is an optional fea-
ture for end-users, the covered users are a subset of the
“Universal User Set”. We take into account only the users
who successively contributed the statistics for more than 3
weeks. In our one-month dataset, the network activity cov-
ers 2,031,007 unique users. We denote such a dataset as
“Networked User Set”.
2.2.3 Device Models and Price
The Wandoujia management app also records the model
information of each device, e.g., Samsung Galaxy Note 2,
Google Nexus. We leverage the device models to classify
users. Finally there are 12,091 diﬀerent device models in
total. Such a result implies the heavy fragmentation of An-
droid devices. To better organize these models, we collected
their listing price information when they were ﬁrstly put
onto market.
2.3 User Privacy
We took a series of steps to preserve the privacy of in-
volved users in our dataset. First, all raw data collected for
this study was kept within the Wandoujia data warehouse

whether to allow Wandoujia to collect the data of network
activities.
e.g., downloading, searching, updating, and uninstalling apps.
The logs of these management activities are all automati-
cally recorded.
Beyond these basic features, the Wandoujia management
app is developed with some advanced but optional features
that can monitor and optimize a device. These features
include network activity statistics, permission monitoring,
content recommendation, etc. All features are developed
upon Android system APIs and do not require “root” priv-
ilege. Users can decide whether to enable these features, as
shown in Figure 1. However, these features are supported
only in the Chinese version.
The Wandoujia management app is automatically launched
and it works as a system-wide service after the device that
installs the app starts up. The data collected on each device
is uploaded to the Wandoujia server every day.
2.2 Data Collection
As of 2015, Wandoujia has over 250 million users. Each
user is actually associated with a unique Android device,
which could be either a smartphone or tablet computer. In
the study of this paper, we collected one-month usage data
from August 4, 2013 to September 2, 2013. The volume of
our data set is 1.2 TB.
Our one-month dataset covers more than 0.2 million (260,172)
Android apps. The data of user behaviors consists of two
types: (1) the data of app management activities (i.e.,
installation, update, and uninstallation) (2) the data of
app network usage (i.e., the traﬃc and access time per
app).
2.2.1 App Management Activities
App management activities consist of downloading4, up-
dating, and uninstalling apps. When an app is installed

tion wizard is presented to users when an app is downloaded.
