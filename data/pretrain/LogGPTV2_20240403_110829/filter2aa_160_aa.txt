Microsoft Portable Executable and Common Object File 
Format Specification 
IMPORTANT—READ CAREFULLY: This Microsoft Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between 
you (either an individual or a single entity) and Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) for the version of the 
Microsoft specification identified above which you are about to download (“Specification”). BY 
DOWNLOADING, COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SPECIFICATION, YOU AGREE TO BE 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, COPY, OR USE THE SPECIFICATION. 
The Specification is owned by Microsoft or its suppliers and is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, 
as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.  
1. LIMITED COVENANT NOT TO SUE.  
(a) Provided that you comply with all terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to the limitations in Sections 1(b) 
– (e) below, Microsoft grants to you the following non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-
sublicenseable, reciprocal limited covenant not to sue:  
(i) 
under any copyrights owned or licensable by Microsoft without payment of consideration to unaffiliated 
third parties, to reproduce the Specification solely for the purposes of creating (x) Image Files and (y) 
Tools; and 
(ii) 
under its Necessary Claims solely to make, have made, use, import, and directly and indirectly, offer to 
sell, sell and otherwise distribute and dispose of Image Files or Tools. 
For purposes of the foregoing, the Specification is “unmodified” if there are no changes, additions or extensions to 
the Specification, “Image Files” means (a) executable files which comply with the Specification in unmodified form 
(“Executable Files”) and (b) object files which comply with the Specification in unmodified form (“Object Files”), 
“ Tools” means (a) linkers which generate Executable Files, (b) compilers which generate Object Files, and (c) 
loaders which load the Executable Files; and “Necessary Claims” means  claims of a patent or patent application 
which are (1) owned or licenseable by Microsoft without payment of consideration to an unaffiliated third party; and 
(2) have an effective filing date on or before December 31, 2010, that must be infringed in order to make an Image 
File or Tool that complies with the Specification (as more fully described in subsection (b) below.  Necessary Claims 
does not include claims relating to semiconductor manufacturing technology or microprocessor circuits or claims not 
required to be infringed in complying with the Specification (even if in the same patent as Necessary Claims). 
(b) The foregoing covenant not to sue shall not extend to any part or function of an Image File which (i) is not required to 
comply with the Specification or (ii) to which there was a commercially reasonable alternative to infringing a Necessary 
Claim. The foregoing covenant not to sue shall not extend to any part or function of a Tool (i) which is not required to 
generate Executable Files (if the Tool is a linker), generate Object Files (if the Tool is a compiler) or load the Executable 
Files (if the Tool is a loader); or (ii) to which there was a commercially reasonable alternative to infringing a Necessary 
Claim. 
(c) The covenant not to sue described above shall be unavailable to you and shall terminate immediately if you or 
any of your Affiliates (collectively “Covenantee Party”) “Initiates” any action for patent infringement against:  (x) 
Microsoft or any of its Affiliates (collectively “Granting Party”), (y) any customers or distributors of the Granting 
Party, or other recipients of a covenant not to sue with respect to the Specification from the Granting Party 
(“Covenantees”); or (z) any customers or distributors of Covenantees (all parties identified in (y) and (z) 
collectively referred to as “Customers”), which action is based on a conformant implementation of the 
Specification.  As used herein, “Affiliate” means any entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or 
is under common control with a party; and control shall mean the power, whether direct or indirect, to direct or 
cause the direct of the management or policies of any entity whether through the ownership of voting securities, by 
contract or otherwise. “Initiates” means that a Covenantee Party is the first (as between the Granting Party and the 
Covenantee Party) to file or institute any legal or administrative claim or action for patent infringement against the 
Granting Party or any of the Customers. “Initiates” includes any situation in which a Covenantee Party files or 
initiates a legal or administrative claim or action for patent infringement solely as a counterclaim or equivalent in 
response to a Granting Party first filing or instituting a legal or administrative patent infringement claim against such 
Covenantee Party. 
(d) The covenant not to sue described above shall not extend to your use of any portion of the Specification for any purpose 
other than (a) to create portions of an operating system (i) only as necessary to adapt such operating system so that it can 
directly interact with a firmware implementation of the Extensible Firmware Initiative Specification v. 1.0 (“EFI 
Specification”); (ii) only as necessary to emulate an implementation of the EFI Specification; and (b) to create 
firmware, applications, utilities and/or drivers that will be used and/or licensed for only the following purposes:  (i) 
to install, repair and maintain hardware, firmware and portions of operating system software which are utilized in the 
boot process; (ii) to provide to an operating system runtime services that are specified in the EFI Specification; (iii) 
to diagnose and correct failures in the hardware, firmware or operating system software; (iv) to query for 
identification of a computer system (whether by serial numbers, asset tags, user or otherwise); (v) to perform 
inventory of a computer system; and (vi) to manufacture, install and setup any hardware, firmware or operating 
system software.  
(e) Microsoft reserves all other rights it may have in the Specification and any intellectual property therein.  The 
furnishing of this document does not give you any covenant not to sue with respect to any other Microsoft patents, 
trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights; or any license with respect to any Microsoft intellectual 
property rights.  Specifically, neither this document nor the Specification give you any license or covenant not to sue 
with respect to any Microsoft linker technology or any intellectual property therein which may be referenced in the 
Specification. 
2.

1. General Concepts 
This document specifies the structure of executable (image) files and object files under the 
Microsoft Windows NT® operating system. These files are referred to as Portable Executable 
(PE) and Common Object File Format (COFF) files respectively. The name “Portable Executable” 
refers to the fact that the format is not architecture-specific. 
Certain concepts appear repeatedly throughout the specification and are described in the 
following table: 
Name 
Description 
Image file 
Executable file: either a .EXE file or a DLL. An image file can be 
thought of as a “memory image.” The term “image file” is usually 
used instead of “executable file,” because the latter sometimes is 
taken to mean only a .EXE file.  
Object file 
A file given as input to the linker. The linker produces an image file, 
which in turn is used as input by the loader. The term “object file” 
does not necessarily imply any connection to object-oriented 
programming. 
RVA 
Relative Virtual Address. In an image file, an RVA is always the 
address of an item once loaded into memory, with the base address 
of the image file subtracted from it. The RVA of an item will almost 
always differ from its position within the file on disk (File Pointer). 
In an object file, an RVA is less meaningful because memory 
locations are not assigned. In this case, an RVA would be an 
address within a section (see below), to which a relocation is later 
applied during linking. For simplicity, compilers should just set the 
first RVA in each section to zero. 
Virtual Address (VA) 
Same as RVA (see above), except that the base address of the 
image file is not subtracted. The address is called a “Virtual 
Address” because Windows NT creates a distinct virtual address 
space for each process, independent of physical memory. For 
almost all purposes, a virtual address should be considered just an 
address. A virtual address is not as predictable as an RVA, 
because the loader might not load the image at its preferred 
location. 
File pointer 
Location of an item within the file itself, before being processed by 
the linker (in the case of object files) or the loader (in the case of 
image files). In other words, this is a position within the file as 
stored on disk. 
Date/Time Stamp 
Date/time stamps are used in a number of places in a PE/COFF 
file, and for different purposes. The format of each such stamp, 
however, is always the same: that used by the time functions in the 
C run-time library. 
Section 
A section is the basic unit of code or data within a PE/COFF file. In 
an object file, for example, all code can be combined within a single 
section, or (depending on compiler behavior) each function can 
occupy its own section. With more sections, there is more file 
overhead, but the linker is able to link in code more selectively. A 
section is vaguely similar to a segment in Intel® 8086 architecture. 
All the raw data in a section must be loaded contiguously. In 
addition, an image file can contain a number of sections, such as 
.tls or .reloc, that have special purposes. 
Attribute certificates are used to associate verifiable statements 
with an image. There are a number of different verifiable 
statements that can be associated with a file, but one of the most 
useful ones, and one that is easy to describe, is a statement by a 
software manufacturer indicating what the message digest of the 
image is expected to be. A message digest is similar to a 
checksum except that it is extremely difficult to forge, and, therefore 
it is very difficult to modify a file in such a way as to have the same 
message digest as the original file. The statement may be verified 
as being made by the manufacturer by use of public/private key 
cryptography schemes. This document does not go into details of 
attribute certificates other than to allow for their insertion into image 
files. 
2. Overview 
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the Microsoft PE executable format and the Microsoft COFF object-
module format. 
Figure 1. Typical 32-Bit Portable .EXE File Layout 
Figure 2. Typical 32-Bit COFF Object Module Layout 
3. File Headers 
The PE file header consists of an MS-DOS stub, the PE signature, the COFF File Header, 
and an Optional Header. A COFF object file header consists of a COFF File Header and 
an Optional Header. In both cases, the file headers are followed immediately by section 
headers. 
3.1. MS-DOS Stub (Image Only) 
The MS-DOS Stub is a valid application that runs under MS-DOS and is placed at the front of the 
.EXE image. The linker places a default stub here, which prints out the message “This program 
cannot be run in DOS mode” when the image is run in MS-DOS. The user can specify another 
stub by using the /STUB linker option. 
At location 0x3c, the stub has the file offset to the Portable Executable (PE) signature. This 
information enables Windows NT to properly execute the image file, even though it has a DOS 
Stub. This file offset is placed at location 0x3c during linking. 
3.2. Signature (Image Only) 
After the MS-DOS stub, at the file offset specified at offset 0x3c, there is a 4-byte signature 
identifying the file as a PE format image file; this format is used in Win32, Posix on Windows NT, 
and for some device drivers in Windows NT. Currently, this signature is “PE\0\0” (the letters “P” 
and “E” followed by two null bytes). 
3.3. COFF File Header (Object & Image) 
At the beginning of an object file, or immediately after the signature of an image file, there is a 
standard COFF header of the following format. Note that the Windows NT loader limits the 
Number of Sections to 96.
