User: I am developing a small application that generates a stochastic animation, and I would want the option to save the animation as a movie. An obvious solution in linux would be to save the images and subprocess a call to ffmpeg or the like, but the program should preferable run on windows as well, without any external dependencies and installations needed (I pack the program with pyinstaller for windows). Is there a solution for this, or will I have to depend on different external applications depending on the platform?
Assistant: opencv can solve this cross platform and has python bindings.
