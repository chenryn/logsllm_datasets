I understand that you are encountering a "permission denied" error while attempting to install `py2app` on your Mac OS X 10.6.8, despite having administrative rights and using the admin profile for the installation. Here are some steps and suggestions that may help you resolve this issue:

### Verify Your Administrative Rights
Even though you have administrative access, it's a good idea to double-check that you are indeed running the command with elevated privileges. You can do this by using `sudo` in the terminal:

```sh
sudo pip install py2app
```

You will be prompted to enter your password. This ensures that the installation process has the necessary permissions.

### Check File Permissions
Sometimes, file or directory permissions can cause issues. Ensure that the directories where `py2app` is being installed have the correct permissions. You can check and modify permissions using the `ls -l` and `chmod` commands, respectively.

### Use a Virtual Environment
Using a virtual environment can help isolate your project and avoid permission issues. You can create and activate a virtual environment as follows:

1. Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   sudo pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```sh
   virtualenv myenv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install `py2app` within the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   pip install py2app
   ```

### Update Python and Dependencies
Your current setup includes Python 2.7 (32-bit) and wxPython (32-bit). While these should generally work, consider updating to more recent versions if possible. However, since you are using an older version of macOS, you might be limited in terms of available updates. 

### Additional Troubleshooting Steps
- **Check for Existing Installation**: Ensure that there isn't an existing partial installation of `py2app` that might be causing conflicts.
- **Log Files**: Check the log files for more detailed error messages. These can often provide clues about what is going wrong.
- **Reinstall Python and Pip**: Sometimes, a fresh installation of Python and `pip` can resolve underlying issues.

### Example Commands
Here is a summary of the commands you might use:

```sh
# Ensure pip is up-to-date
sudo pip install --upgrade pip

# Create and activate a virtual environment
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install py2app in the virtual environment
pip install py2app
```
