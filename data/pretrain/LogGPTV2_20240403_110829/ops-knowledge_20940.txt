User: I am trying really REALLY hard to install py2app, but whenever I run the install command on the source code, I get half way through and then I get a permission denied error. Does anyone have an idea about how I could fix this? I do have admin rights on the machine I am using. I am using the admin's profile to do the installation...so I am really stumped. Any help would be awesome.
I am running Mac OS X 10.6.8
I am using Python 2.7 (64 bit, but running with the 32 bit preferences)
I am using wxPython (32 bit because that is all that wxPython has to offer on a Mac)
Assistant: I had this problem for a long time. Try running it as admin.
