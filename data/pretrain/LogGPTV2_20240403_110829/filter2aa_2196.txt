Curriculum
Daniel J. Burroughs
University of Central Florida
About myself
• Assistant Professor at UCF
• Research includes
– Correlation of distributed network sensors
– Law enforcement data sharing network
University of Central Florida
•
Established in 1963
•
Part of the Florida State University System
•
Located 13 miles east of Orlando
•
42,837 Students
•
5,500 in Engineering and Computer Science
Information Systems Technology
• IST
– Undergraduate program in the 
College of Engineering
– Applied Engineering Degree
– Heavy concentration of hands-on learning, 
real-world applications & experience
The Challenge
• Industry demand for trained security personnel
• Traditional Computer Science/Engineering 
degrees do little to prepare someone to be a 
security professional
• Our (attempt at a) solution
– Develop a well rounded security program
– Teach the “security mindset”
– Get out of the books and on the networks
The Fundamentals
• Program is part of the College of Engineering
– Analytical problem solving background
– Ability to break down problems 
– Design of large scale systems and solutions
• During first two years, students are encourage to 
pursue various certifications
– General alphabet soup of certificates
– Concentration on network administration
The Fundamentals
• Program breaks down into four tracks
– Security core
– Firewall, IDS, & Forensics
– Secure system development
– Other topics
• Focuses on all aspects of security, not just 
computer and network
– Ties in with Criminal Justice Department and the 
College of Health and Public Affairs

What is special about this?
• National Center for Forensic Studies
– NCFS :  Located in UCF’s Research Park
– Digital Forensic Research Center
• Public Safety Technology Center
– Criminal Justice security research center
• Hands on approach
What is special about this?
• High degree of interaction between courses
– Students in the App. Def. Strategies courses build 
systems that students in the computer network and 
security course attempt to break into while students in 
the IDS and forensics courses attempt to determine 
what is going on….
• This hands on approach is the cornerstone of 
our program
Why am I here
• My goal in giving this presentation is to get 
feedback
– What do you think needs to be in such a program?
– What do you think we are doing wrong?
– What do you think we are doing right?
– What would you want out of a similar program?
