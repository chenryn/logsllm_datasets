ABSTRACT
We consider the eﬀect attackers who disrupt anonymous
communications have on the security of traditional high- and
low-latency anonymous communication systems, as well as
on the Hydra-Onion and Cashmere systems that aim to oﬀer
reliable mixing, and Salsa, a peer-to-peer anonymous com-
munication network. We show that denial of service (DoS)
lowers anonymity as messages need to get retransmitted to
be delivered, presenting more opportunities for attack. We
uncover a fundamental limit on the security of mix networks,
showing that they cannot tolerate a majority of nodes be-
ing malicious. Cashmere, Hydra-Onion, and Salsa security is
also badly aﬀected by DoS attackers. Our results are backed
by probabilistic modeling and extensive simulations and are
of direct applicability to deployed anonymity systems.

works [4]. The research involved both design of new sys-
tems, some of which have enjoyed moderately successful de-
ployment, and analysis of existing designs. In both cases,
the evaluation of anonymity systems has largely focused on
the security of the systems—that is, how likely it is that
anonymity is compromised—with other metrics considered
tangential. Recent work, however, has started to address
metrics such as performance, usability, and reliability [8, 23,
15, 18, 30], due to the fact that these “secondary” character-
istics are in fact of primary importance: a system that is in-
eﬃcient, unreliable, or unusable in some other way will cause
users to take their communication to other, non-anonymous
channels.
Reliability, however, has a subtler and previously unex-
plored connection with security. Instead of a blanket denial-
of-service (DoS) attack, an adversary may selectively aﬀect
reliability of the system in those states that are hardest to
compromise, thereby causing the system to enter less se-
cure states. In particular, we explore an attack where DoS
is performed whenever the communication cannot be com-
promised. Such selective DoS is both easier to carry out
than an attack on the entire system, and can be more ef-
fective; instead of driving users away from the system, they
are presented with a less reliable, but still functional sys-
tem. Faced with poor reliability, many users (and a lot of
software) will naturally attempt the communication again,
presenting more opportunities for attack.
We analyze the success of this attack as applied to conven-
tional low and high-latency anonymous systems. The low-
latency systems are exempliﬁed by Tor, a popular anony-
mous communications network, and we model high-latency
systems as a mix network such as the Mixminion [6] anony-
mous remailer network. In both cases, we show that as more
nodes are compromised, systems under a selective DoS at-
tack grow much more vulnerable than conventional secu-
rity analysis would suggest. In particular, we show for the
ﬁrst time a fundamental limit on the security of the tradi-
tional mix architecture: messages routed in a network with a
majority of compromised nodes can be de-anonymized with
high probability by an adversary performing DoS attacks.
Previous work [3] challenged the established wisdom that a
92single honest node is suﬃcient for security, but not to the
extent our results demonstrate.
We also examine two proposed systems designed to im-
prove the reliability of mix networks: Cashmere [30] and
Hydra-Onions [18]. We ﬁnd that though both systems do
improve reliability, they do so at the price of reduced secu-
rity, especially in the face of DoS. Cashmere is particularly
susceptible to DoS because its authors erroneously believed
that DoS was not a security concern and developed no mech-
anisms to deal with it. Hydra-Onions prove more resistant,
but oﬀer poor security when a signiﬁcant number of nodes
are compromised.
Finally, we look at how selective DoS aﬀects Salsa [21].
Salsa is a low-latency anonymous communication system
that is based on a peer-to-peer design, with the goal of sur-
passing the scaling limits that are faced by network such as
Tor, and so we can think of it as an example of what “next
generation” anonymous networks might be like. However,
to deal with uncertainty of the p2p context, Salsa relies on
redundant lookups, and is therefore more vulnerable to the
selective DoS attack than conventional systems.
In the following section, we analyze selective denial of ser-
vice against traditional high and low-latency mix systems.
Section 3 examines our selective DoS attack against anony-
mous communication systems engineered speciﬁcally for reli-
ability. We discuss the vulnerability of Salsa to the selective
DoS attack in Section 4. Section 5 discusses potential coun-
termeasures to selective DoS and in Section 6, we conclude.
2. DENIAL OF SERVICE AGAINST
CONVENTIONAL ANONYMITY
SYSTEMS
2.1 Tor
The Tor network [9] is a widely used system for low-
latency anonymous Internet communication. The network
has enjoyed quick growth since its initial deployment in 2003;
as of August 2007, Tor is composed of nearly 1000 active
routers supporting hundreds of thousands of users [24].
Communication over Tor happens through tunnels that
are sent via multiple Tor routers. The tunnels are con-
structed in a telescoping manner and are protected by lay-
ered encryption, so that each router only knows the previous
and next routers forwarding the tunnel. However, the low-
latency nature of the communication allows the ﬁrst and last
router in a tunnel to collude and easily discover that they
are forwarding the same stream by matching packet timings.
Therefore, under conventional analysis, if t is the fraction of
all Tor routers that are compromised, then t2 is the proba-
bility that any individual tunnel will be compromised [27].
This analysis assumes that routers are picked at random.
In practice, Tor picks routers in proportion to their adver-
tised bandwidth; this may be modeled by setting t to be
the fraction of total bandwidth controlled by the attackers.
Recent versions of Tor also use guard nodes in building tun-
nels. We present the analysis of Tor as originally described
in [9] and discuss guard nodes in Section 2.1.2.
2.1.1 Reliability Analysis
The reliability of Tor tunnels is straightforward to deter-
mine. A Tor tunnel that goes through l routers (l is typically
3) will fail if any of the routers fail. Therefore, if f is the

probability of a router being reliable, R = f l is the proba-
bility of the entire tunnel being reliable.1
Though the Tor authors considered the selective denial of
service attack in their threat model, they did not analyze
its impact. Next, we analyze the eﬀect of a selective DoS
on Tor. We assume that dishonest routers will perform DoS
on any tunnel they cannot compromise. This attack is easy
to implement: if the adversary acts as a ﬁrst or last router
on a tunnel, the tunnel is observed for a brief period of
time and matched against all other tunnels where a colluding
router is the last or ﬁrst router, respectively. If there is a
match, the tunnel is compromised; otherwise, the adversary
kills the tunnel by no longer forwarding traﬃc on it. The
adversary also kills all tunnels where it is the middle node,
unless both the previous and the next hop are also colluding.
Alternately, Bauer et al. present an algorithm for linking
tunnels even before traﬃc has been sent over them [1].
Under this attack, a tunnel is reliable only if the ﬁrst and
last nodes are compromised, or if it is composed of only
reliable honest nodes. So the overall reliability of Tor in this
case is:
RDoS = (1 − t)2 + (tf )3
Figure 1 plots the reliability of Tor under the selective
DoS attack as a function of t, with f = 0.99. The reliability
decreases as the number of compromised nodes grows, until
it reaches a minimum at t = 0.55, at which point it starts
to rise again. This is because at that point, the (1 − t)2
component starts to dominate; that is, the dishonest nodes
start to perform DoS on fewer tunnels because they can now
compromise more of them.
Figure 1 also shows the number of secure tunnels, as a
fraction of reliable ones; i.e. the conditional probability of
a tunnel being secure given that it is reliable. This is a
useful calculation, since the Tor software, faced with a non-
functioning tunnel, will create a new one in its place, and will
repeat this until a working tunnel is constructed; the condi-
tional probability states the likelihood that this ﬁnal tunnel
will be secure. For high values of t, the line closely matches
the conventional security ﬁgure of t2, but with higher num-
bers of compromised nodes it quickly diverges. For example,
with t = 0.5, conventional analysis suggests that 75% of all

picked without replacement, but with l = 3 and about 1000
routers, this is a suitable approximation.
paths should be secure, whereas under the selective-DoS at-
tack, only 33% of the successful paths are uncompromised.
Of course, one hopes that fewer than 50% of Tor routers
are dishonest—it would seem diﬃcult for an adversary to
compromise 400 out of 800 routers. However, the Tor net-
work is run by volunteers and it accepts new routers with
minimal veriﬁcation; it is therefore not out of the question
for some organization to contribute many new routers to
the system, under diﬀerent identities, and compromise a
signiﬁcant percentage of routers2. Additionally, attackers
can misrepresent their bandwidth to gain a higher eﬀective
t value [1]. The important point is that the conventional
analysis of Tor security signiﬁcantly underestimates the vul-
nerability of Tor in this scenario.
2.1.2 Guard Nodes
The selective DoS attack is particularly troubling due to
the predecessor attack [28]. As users pick random paths
in a Tor network, one of these paths will be compromised
with high probability after O((1 − t)2 ln n) path construc-
tions, where n is the total number of nodes in the network.
With a selective DoS attack, the attack will function much
faster. To resist the predecessor attack, Tor has introduced
a defense where each user picks a small ﬁxed set of guard
nodes that are always used as the ﬁrst node in a tunnel [29].
Users who pick honest guard nodes will be immune to the
predecessor attack.
Guard nodes similarly help defend against selective DoS;
users with honest guards may suﬀer in terms of reliability
but their anonymity will never be compromised. However,
in another way, guard nodes actually make the selective DoS
attack more powerful, since the probability that a single suc-
cessful tunnel will be compromised is actually higher using
guards. For example, it is easy to see that with a single
guard node, (1 − t) of all tunnels will be compromised; our
preliminary results show that using 3 guard nodes, as in the
current Tor implementation, also results in a higher num-
ber of compromised tunnels. We leave a full investigation of
guard nodes to future work, but we note that ﬁxing both the
ﬁrst and last node, as studied by Wright et al. [29], is more
likely to be an eﬀective defense to selective DoS in Tor.
2.2 Mix Networks
We next discuss the application of the selective DoS attack
to high-latency systems based on mix networks, such as the
MixMaster [20] and MixMinion [6] networks used for sending
anonymous email.
A mix is a router that hides the correspondence between
its input and output messages. Mix-Net systems [4] consist
of a series of such mixes and provide unlinkability between a
sender and recipient. In the original proposal, each message
is sent through a sequence of mixes that is chosen randomly
from all available mixes. Messages are encrypted in layers
with the public keys of the mixes and are then sent through
them in series before reaching their eventual destination.
