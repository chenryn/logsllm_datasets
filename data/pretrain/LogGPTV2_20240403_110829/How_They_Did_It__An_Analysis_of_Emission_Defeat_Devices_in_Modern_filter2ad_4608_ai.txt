### Matched Cycles (Upper Bound)

The following list details the various test cycles used for emissions testing, categorized by their respective regulatory frameworks:

**US EPA and CARB Legislation:**
- ECE-15, EUDC(L), NEDC
- ECE-15, FTP-75, HWFET, LA92, NEDC, SC03, US06

**EU Legislation:**
- ECE-15, EUDC(L), NEDC
- ECE-15, FTP-75, HWFET, LA92, NEDC, SC03, US06
- ECE-15, NEDC
- (deactivated) ECE-15, EUDC(L), NEDC

**International Standards:**
- CADC-RURAL, CADC-URBAN, ECE-15, EUDC(L), FTP-75, HWFET, IM240, J1015, JP10, LA92, NEDC, RTS-95, SC03, US06, WLTP-1, WLTP-2, WLTP-3

### Distinguishing Regular Driving Conditions from Emission Test Conditions

There are two primary approaches to distinguish regular street driving conditions from those exhibited during emission tests: active and passive detection.

**Active Detection:**
- **Characteristics:** Active detection techniques consider specific characteristics of the vehicle during emission tests, allowing them to target specific tests.
- **Example:** The Volkswagen defeat device can detect an ongoing emission test based on the car’s driving profile and compare it to well-known test curves.
- **Proposed Method:** Our approach, CURVEDIFF, is a curve-agnostic method that detects when firmware attempts to match a certain driving profile. This method has identified multiple instances of such devices.
- **Other Approaches:** Car manufacturers could implement other active evasion methods, such as matching profiles of related parameters like speed or torque, as seen in the Opel Zafira.

**Passive Detection:**
- **Characteristics:** Passive detection techniques do not actively observe vehicle specifics but rather target general peculiarities of emission tests.
- **Example:** Emission tests are typically short, so a car could stay in a compliant mode for the duration of the average test and switch to a more harmful emissions policy afterward, as seen in the Fiat defeat device.
- **Additional Methods:** An ECU can use all available sensors to fingerprint the testing environment, such as measuring temperature or ambient pressure. Hardware-based approaches, like over-inflating tires for dynamometer tests, also fall into this category.
- **Future Work:** We plan to study the viability of detecting passive defeat devices by tracking data flow in the code and analyzing sensor conditions that influence subsystems like Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR).

### Implementation and Future Enhancements

We have implemented our approach in a tool called CURVEDIFF. Given that we perform an intra-procedural analysis, we might miss certain implementations of defeat devices. An inter-procedural analysis could enhance the soundness of our implementation. Additionally, our analysis can be extended to include more primitive building blocks such as timers and multiplexers to deepen the understanding of the detection logic.

### Conclusion

As software control becomes a pervasive feature in complex systems, regulators in the automotive domain face the challenge of certifying software systems where manufacturers have a strong financial incentive to cheat. In this paper, we described two families of defeat devices used in the Bosch EDC17 ECU to circumvent US emission tests. The first family was used by Volkswagen, leading to the diesel emissions scandal. The second device appears in the diesel Fiat 500X sold in Europe. We also presented and evaluated an automated approach to detect defeat devices in a given firmware image based on insights from manually analyzing the Volkswagen defeat device.
