# IPv4 Object Ranking for August 1, 2019 Based on Alexa List

The following table presents the ranking of IPv4 objects based on the Alexa list as of August 1, 2019. The rankings include BGP prefixes and normalized (Norm) prefixes. If both BGP and Norm ranks are provided, the weight is given for the BGP prefix. The weight for the normalized prefix may differ due to varying splitting of domain weights if multiple objects are reached.

### Methodology
- **Weight Calculation**: The weight for each BGP prefix is calculated by summing up the weights of all domains pointing to it.
- **Normalized Prefixes**: For normalized prefixes, the weight is split among the targeted prefixes to keep the sum of weights at one (100%).
- **Ranking**: The ranking is based on the cumulative weight of the prefixes. The AS weight is the sum of the BGP prefix weights.

### Example
For example, the domain `tmall.com` transfers its weight of 0.0226 from Table 1 to its A-records, which are in the prefixes `140.205.94.0/24` and `140.205.130.0/24`.

### Analysis
1. **Daily New Prefixes**:
   - Figure 1 shows the incremental coverage of generated prefix top lists over time.
   - Alexa provides the best coverage of IPv4 prefixes, while Umbrella covers most IPv6 prefixes.
   - New prefixes are still added even after five months of measurements, with low-ranked domains contributing to these new additions.

2. **Temporal Stability**:
   - Figure 3 shows the daily Zipf weight changes during a four-month measurement period.
   - The Alexa domain top list is the least stable, whereas IPv6 prefix top lists exhibit the greatest stability.
   - High-weight domains performing DNS load balancing lead to Zipf weights being shifted to different prefixes, causing volatility in the Alexa and Majestic-based prefix top lists.

### Conclusion
Prefix top lists provide a novel view on the importance of IP prefixes in the Internet. The rankings not only export the weight but also show how many domains point into the respective object and how many distinct IP addresses are referenced. Some ASes, like Cloudflare, have many domains pointing to them, while others, like CNNIC-ALIBABA, host fewer but higher-ranked domains.
