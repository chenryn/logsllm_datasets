We plot expression (3) in Figure 8; note that we normal-
ize the energy with respect to Ts (therefore obtaining the
average power of the signal). On the same ﬁgure, we also
plot the energy of the unobstructed signal s(t) = cos(ω0t),
i.e., Es =
cos2(ω0t)dt = Ts/2. A striking result on
this ﬁgure is that for most values of θ the adversary actu-
ally contributes to the energy of the original signal s(t). In
order to at least attenuate s(t), the adversary has to ensure
that θ ∈ (−θ0, θ0), where θ0 is calculated as follows:

We now show how demanding it is for the attacker to
keep the phase shift θ within the given bounds. We know
that θ = ω0Δt, for a time shift (delay) Δt. In time Δt, the
electromagnetic wave can travel the distance Δd = Δt · c,
where c is the propagation speed of the wave. We call Δd
the distance shift. Combining these expressions we have:

In Figure 9 we plot expression (5) for different frequen-
cies f0. We can see that the higher the frequency of the sig-
nal is, the higher the impact of the ﬁxed distance shift Δd
on the phase shift θ is. More importantly, for f0 = 5 GHz
(IEEE 802.11a), a Δd as small as 1 cm results in phase shift
of π
3 . As we discussed above, the adversary has to ensure
, in order to at least attenuate the
signal s(t). A more reasonable goal for the adversary would
be to reduce the energy of the signal s(t) for say 50%, which
requires, for f0 = 5 GHz, θ ∈ [0, 0.7227) ∪ (5.5605, 2π].
This phase shift corresponds to Δd ≈ 7 mm. Therefore, for
high frequencies, the adversary has to estimate the distances
between himself and both the sender and the receiver with a
very high accuracy. Otherwise, he cannot hope to have the
phase shift fall within the desired interval.
3 , 2π
If the distance between the sender and the receiver con-
tinuously changes (in a fashion unpredictable to the at-
tacker), the uncertainty of the adversary is further increased
(note that this can be a very limited motion, in the order of

Δd). Therefore, in a sense, mobility helps security. Another
source of the uncertainty for the adversary is the time delay
Δt = Δd/c. For example, a distance shift Δd = 7 mm is
equivalent to a delay of Δt ≈ 23 ps. Therefore, the adver-
sary has to operate with an extremely high time accuracy,
otherwise he cannot keep θ within the desired bounds.
Finally, if we assume that the receiver is equipped with
two (or more) mutually separated antennas (as in multiple
antenna systems [20]), then a signal from some transmitter
will most likely arrive at the antennas with different phases.
Moreover, this shift between the phases of the received sig-
nals will depend on the distances between the antennas as
well as the relative position of the attacker with respect to
the antennas. As we already saw above, at very high fre-
quencies, even a very small distance shift will cause a sig-
niﬁcant phase shift. Any uncertainty in the distance shift
(e.g., uncertainty regarding the positions of the antennas,
etc.) implies uncertainty in the phase shift. We therefore
conclude that it is reasonable to model phase shift θ by a
random variable with appropriate distribution.
6.2 Randomization at the Sender
We already saw in Figure 8 that for 1/3 of the possible
phase shifts, the adversary actually attenuates the sender’s
signal. Therefore, when using only a single waveform (e.g.,
cos(ω0t)) during the whole period Ts, the adversary may
have a non-negligible probability to attenuate the desired
signal. For example, assuming θ is a sample of a random
variable Θ with uniform distribution on [0, 2π), the adver-
sary attenuates the signal in the single time interval Ts with
probability 1/3. We now show how to make this probability
satisfactorily small.
The idea is to split the symbol interval Ts into K smaller

and equal time slots Tm when the symbol “1” is to be sent.
Then, for each mini-slot Tm, the sender generates a signal
with the phase chosen uniformly at random from [0, 2π) and
emits these K signals on the channel during the time Ts. For
example, these K signals can be described by the following
random process S(t) = cos(ω0t + Φ), where Φ is a random
variable with uniform distribution on [0, 2π).
From the discussion in the previous section, it is reason-
able to model the phase shift as a random variable Θ. Let us
assume Θ to be uniformly distributed on [0, 2π). Let pα be
the probability that the adversary attenuates the signal emit-
ted in a given mini-time slot for at least (1 − α) × 100 %,
that is, Er/Es ≤ α, where α ∈ [0, 1]. We say that any such
mini-slot signal is α-attenuated4. For Θ uniform random
variable, i.e. fΘ(θ) = 1
√
where θα = 2 arcsin (
α/2), the equality (1) follows from
expression (4), and the equality (2) follows from the distri-
bution of Θ.
We further note that Φ and Θ are independent random
variables; indeed, Θ models the inability of the adversary
to perfectly estimate the required distances and/or any de-
lay that the adversary introduces. Therefore, pα (as given in
expression (6)), is the same for all the K mini-slots. Then,
for the ﬁxed time interval Ts, the probability that the num-
ber Ka of α-attenuated mini-slot signals is exactly k ≤ K,
can be calculated from the binomial distribution with pa-
rameters p = pα and q = 1 − pα as follows
