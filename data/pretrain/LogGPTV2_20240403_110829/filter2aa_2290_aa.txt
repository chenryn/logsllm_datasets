### ZeroDay: Roswell
#### By Richard Thieme

I used to believe that deathbed revelations were mere nonsense. I knew many individuals who, even in their final moments, adhered to their vows. Some even disseminated disinformation under torture. Intelligence professionals are trained to maintain discipline, and I was no exception.

Then, I received the diagnosis: inoperable cancer, ravaging my stomach, liver, and intestines. The pain management is effective, but I choose to feel it, as a reminder of my impending end. When the morphine haze begins to blur my urgency, I reduce the medication until the pain returns, ensuring I remain coherent and mindful of my limited time.

I am writing to three of you, each for reasons you understand, and sending a copy to a writer who can handle this information responsibly. He is not one of the usual suspects, not a name you would recognize, and certainly not one of the "useful idiots" we use to spread disinformation. This man understands that fiction is often the best way to convey the truth. I am also sharing this with a single blogger, so the real information will be hidden on the internet, much like the gold in the fairy tale. 

You remember the story, right? A man forced a dwarf to reveal where gold was buried in a forest. The man tied a scarf around the tree and went to get a shovel, making the dwarf swear he wouldn't untie it. But while he was gone, the dwarf tied scarves around all the trees. So, at least one blog will have the correct information.

The pain is intense, and with each wave, more of my life's memories fade into darkness. I feel pieces of myself disappearing with every breath. Memory modules disconnect, and the stories, distortions, and lies become indistinguishable. I am no longer sure what is true.

I played a significant role in constructing the false history you live by. I created false points of reference to anchor your beliefs, leading you to wander in a mist, thinking the sun was shining brightly. Even I confused the darkness for sunlight. Is that any consolation? Perhaps that’s why I want to tell you the truth about Roswell. I just want to shed a little light before I die.

The human condition is hard enough, with death eroding our memories and shredding the fabric of our shared mythical history. Many events leave no record, and orders whispered and carried out are forgotten. Most real history disappears, and the narratives that remain are often bound together with illusions, which eventually lose their hold. Things fall apart, and nothing is as it seems.

Working in the intelligence community, I know how most nodes, the keys that unlock the real stories, are hidden or altered to blend with an acceptable narrative. Without a point of reference, you cannot know what you don’t know. These nodes are hidden in a complex, non-Euclidean space. Most of us Masters know some, but not all; a few know most. The solutions to these puzzles are layered, and to see them whole, you would need to enter hyper-dimensional space and view everything from there.

Enigma is one example. Before it was known that the Allies cracked the German code, everything written about the war, Churchill, and FDR was based on a false point of reference. Once historians knew the truth, the entire context shifted, and history looked different. It makes you dizzy to realize this, so you recoil into a saner, more comfortable place. But please, listen to me. I am going to alter your beliefs. However disingenuous I may seem, I want to bequeath to you the little bit of the bigger truth that I still have.

You may not be familiar with the term "humplings." Imagine humanity as a bell curve shaped like an animal, with a snout, a big hump, and a tail. Ten percent live in the nose, ten percent in the tail, and eighty percent in the hump. The front are the Masters who manage reality, and the tail contains the dregs, benchmarks that humplings use to reassure themselves. The eighty percent in the hump are the humplings, inching along inside a shared consensus, defined by things that are real but contextualized by the points of reference we provide. Since World War II, we have managed this hump, keeping humplings busy and not quite comfortable, chasing dreams and buying things they don’t need. We use sleight of hand, illusion, and if something leaks, we discredit or ridicule the sources, hiding it in plain sight.

We Masters make history and then hide it. We have put many people in power, and if I were to name them, you’d be amazed. But this isn’t a primer on the Big Picture. I need to tell you just enough to help you understand the Roswell event. You do want to know, don’t you? Ever since you heard about an alien spacecraft crashing in the New Mexico desert in 1947, or alien bodies being found, or a rancher showing his kid material that couldn’t be burned or broken, or technologies we might have seeded into R&D—don’t you want to know how much of that was real?

Think about how the story came to you in pieces. When did you first hear it? What did you hear? It’s all a confabulated blur. Where do you get your information? From television, sitcoms, talk shows, books, movies, or tabloid headlines? That’s how we do it, slipping it little by little into the known and familiar, using repetition and reinforcement until there’s a shared memory. You repeat those falsehoods to each other until they become facts.

Anyway, the grays that crashed in the desert were not the first. Aliens had been emerging from portals for centuries, keeping us under surveillance. Sometimes they landed to check our reactions, appearing as chariots in the sky, visions of angels and saints. Once we could see them as machines with people from other places, they altered their strategy, maintaining a polite distance until we were used to their presence. Like NORAD telling radar operators to ignore blips, they became like pigeons in the park, unnoticed. Some look like us, blending in, studying our languages and cultures, conducting physical exams on “volunteers.” They did sophisticated brain scans long before we knew about electricity.

Mostly, they maintained sentinels until, we believe, we were on the brink of becoming a Second Level species. Then they paid closer attention. This is inference, and I can’t tell you everything. I wish I had started telling the truth sooner.

I was involved, but not at the top. Smarter people than me are managing this. We operate through a compartmented matrix of need-to-know modules, forming an elite managerial class. Sometimes we’re as bumbling as humplings, but we forgive ourselves quickly, having developed a confident culture after generations of sanctioned malfeasance.

But I digress. (I need to take a pill. Please wait.)

OK. Here’s an example you should understand. Most of you use the Internet, right? The Internet is a double-edged sword. Like speech or writing, any symbolic matrix invites projections. We reveal ourselves every time we communicate. The Net sucks everything out of us, good, bad, and indifferent.

Bad guys use the net too. (We’re the good guys, remember; whoever we’re fighting is bad.) After Northwoods Two, when the war on terror intensified and the flow of funds and fear was at a manageable level, the evil doers ramped up their use of the Net for nefarious purposes. Their websites multiplied like roaches, making humplings anxious. We amplified your fear through the nightly news, showing photos, adding sound bites, and frightening you. Ads then soothed you, and you went out and bought stuff.

Some of you, predictably, became enraged. Fear turns to anger easily, especially in men afraid to feel fear. If you’re a hacker, you’ll attack those websites, thinking you’re helping. But invisible enemies are dangerous. We don’t want the websites down; we want them up to track visitors, downloads, and communications. So when a well-intentioned humpling defaces or DOSes an enemy website, we have to restore it. We invented anonymizers, email programs, honeypots, and partnered with big tech companies. We built remote access into hardware and software, and we detect everything. The whole network is metered. If someone uses crypto, it’s already cracked, and the fact of its use tells us they’ve something to hide. We encourage paranoia, making people predictable and easy to track.

Some of those bad guy sites were a mess. We had to do remote administration, install firewalls, close holes, and apply patches. Sometimes we kept the holes open, of course. That’s how we get in. So when a do-gooder reveals a software flaw, we have to stop them. Those holes are useful. You can’t exploit a secure Net.

Well-intentioned humplings are a headache. They want to do good, but we want them distracted. We don’t need partners; we need secrecy and resources. Stay with me. I’m telling you this to show you what the aliens did. This has a point.

It’s not easy. Humplings are not used to thinking outside the lines, and it’s hard for Americans to understand other cultures. We don’t appreciate people who blow themselves up, even though we do it too. But we make it look different, like something Americans do, so you don’t notice.
