ZeroDay: Roswell 
by 
Richard Thieme 
I used to think that death bed revelations were nonsense. I knew lots of guys who kept 
their vows to the last breath. Some even spread disinformation as they died under torture. 
Intelligence professionals have discipline that sticks, most of the time.  
I was sure that I did too.  
Then I got the diagnosis. Cancer, inoperable. All through the gut. Stomach, liver, the 
intestines.  
As if I couldn’t guess. 
Luckily we manage pain well these days. I feel as much as I want to feel. The pain 
reminds me that my life is nearly over. I don’t want to forget that. A morphine haze 
reduces the urgency I need to make myself tell the truth. If I find myself drifting into a 
fog, dreaming about something in my non-existent future, I ease up on the meds until I 
vomit, bent double and clutching my gut, then take pills until I’m coherent again but can 
still remember that I only have a day or two left. 
I am writing to three of you (you each know why and do not need to know the identity of 
the others) and sending one copy to a writer who will know how to use this information.  
He is not one of the usual suspects, not a name you would know, certainly not one of the 
useful idiots we use to spread disinformation. (We have more reporters in our stable than 
stars in the sky. And they say that two sources validate a story!)  I am giving it to a man 
who understands that fiction is the only way to tell the truth.  
I am also giving the story to a blogger, but just one. So real gold will be buried on the Net 
like the dwarf did in that fairy tale. (That’s an inside joke. You’ll understand in a minute.)   
You remember the fairy tale, right? A guy forced a dwarf to tell him where gold was 
buried in a forest? But he didn’t have a shovel? So he tied a scarf around the tree and 
went to get one after making the dwarf swear he wouldn’t untie it? But while he was 
gone, the dwarf tied scarves around all of the trees?  
So one blog, at least, will have it right. 
My God but this pain is intense. With each wave, more of the contents of my life tumble 
into the darkness. I feel pieces of myself fall away with every breath. Memory modules 
disconnect and disappear—so many stories, so much distortion, so many lies.  I don’t 
even know what’s true anymore.

I have been instrumental in building the false history that you live in, that you believe. I 
created false points of reference to anchor your beliefs. You have been wandering in a 
mist, thinking the sun was shining brightly. I confused the darkness for the sunlight, too. 
Is that any consolation? Maybe that’s why I want to tell you the truth about Roswell. I 
just want to shed a little real light before I die.  
The human condition is hard enough, what with death mincing our memories, shredding 
the fabric of our shared mythical history. Many events leave no record at all. Orders were 
whispered and once they were carried out, the deed never happened. Most real history 
disappears. The narratives that remain are often bound together with glue to create 
illusions, but over time, even those lose the ability to stick. Things fall apart.  
Nothing is what it seems. 
Working in the intelligence community all my life, I know how most nodes, the keys that 
unlock the real stories, are hidden or were altered to blend in with an acceptable 
narrative, the consensus reality in which you live. Without a point of reference, don’t you 
see, you can’t know what you don’t know. But the points of reference are hidden on other 
planes in some kind of complex non-Euclidean space. Most of us Masters know some but 
not all, a few of us know most. Those nodes require keys to a code, but even if you had 
them, they would lead you into a cul-de-sac. The solutions to the puzzles are always 
layered, and to see it whole, you would have to go through a portal into hyper-
dimensional space and turn around and see how everything looks from there.   
Enigma is one example. There are many more. 
Before it was known that the Allies cracked the German code, everything written about 
the war, about Churchill, what he knew when, what FDR might know, was written from a 
false point of reference. Once historians knew that he knew what he knew and when, 
everything shifted, the entire context of how you humplings knew your own history 
shifted. History not only looked different, history was different. What you thought you 
had lived was seen in a parallax view. It makes you dizzy to realize this, I know, so you 
recoil into a saner, more comfortable place. It is going to take energy for you to listen to 
what I am saying.   
But please do listen. Please, you who for a moment are free of pain and live in the light 
and think the darkness will not win. That’s one of the myths you celebrate in story and 
song. But I am already fluctuating between the fading light and the immense waiting 
darkness and I can see that the darkness does win.  It does. So please, please listen.  
I am going to alter your beliefs. However disingenuous I may sometimes seem, I want to 
bequeath to you humplings the little bit of the bigger truth that I still have. 
Oh? You’re not familiar with that term, humplings?

Let’s say that humanity makes up a bell curve and it looks like an animal, OK? It has a 
snout, a big hump and a tail. Ten per cent live in the nose. Ten per cent live in the tail. Up 
front are the Masters who manage reality. That’s us. Back in the tail are the dregs. 
They’re benchmarks that humplings use to tell themselves they’re doing fine. That’s why 
we keep them. The eighty per cent that live in the hump—that’s the humplings. That’s 
you. You inch along inside a shared consensus like a huge worm. Your world is defined 
by things that are real but they’re contextualized by those points of reference I 
mentioned, the ones we provide. The index by which you arrange memories and 
thoughts, in other words, creates an illusive matrix in which you live but which you never 
see.  
Fish in water. Humplings in a hump.  
Since shortly after World War 2, we have managed that hump. We had to, don’t you see. 
Humplings don’t know what’s best for themselves. Humplings are happiest when kept 
busy and not quite comfortable. Then you buy things you don’t need in pursuit of a peace 
you will never have. The thirty year mortgage, one of our ideas, was sheer genius. During 
your potentially dangerous years, it keeps you invested in stability, chasing a dream. 
Because you want to keep believing what you believe, you’re easy to deceive. We use 
sleight of hand or illusion, and if something leaks, we discredit or ridicule the sources. 
Then we can hide it in plain sight. Everyone swears it isn’t there and walks all around it.   
We Masters make history, then hide it. We have put so many people into power, if I were 
to tell you their names, these political figures around the world we have assisted in 
different ways, you’d be amazed. The list is long, and the names are distinguished. 
But this isn’t a primer on the Big Picture. I need to tell you just enough about our work to 
help you make sense of the Roswell event. But first, you need some new points of 
reference.  
You do want to know, don’t you? I mean, ever since you heard that an alien spacecraft 
might have crashed in the New Mexico desert in 1947, ever since you heard that alien 
bodies might have been found or that a rancher maybe showed his kid material you 
couldn’t burn or break, ever since you heard of technologies we might have seeded into 
R&D, giving them to Bell Labs, Xerox Park, RCA, IBM and other friendly household 
names so alien technologies would become part of the history Americans pretend to have 
invented–you do want to know how much of that was real, don’t you? 
Think of how the story came to you in pieces. When did you first hear it? What did you 
hear? You can’t remember, can you? It’s all a confabulated blur. Where do you get your 
information? From television, right? From a joke in a sitcom or on a talk show, from 
books or movies or reading tabloid headlines while waiting to pay at the supermarket – 
that’s how we do it, slipping it little by little into the known and familiar, using repetition 
and reinforcement until there’s a shared memory. You repeat those falsehoods to each 
other until they become facts.

You can’t change reality,  but you can change the facts.  
Anyway, the grays that crashed in the desert were not the first. Aliens had been exploding 
out of portals for centuries, keeping us under surveillance. Sometimes they landed to 
check our reactions. Chariots in the skies, visions of angels and saints. Once we were able 
to see them as machines with people from other places, they altered their strategy, 
showing themselves but keeping a polite distance until we were used to their presence. 
Like NORAD telling radar guys to ignore the blips, those are only “visitors” coming 
down the coast at impossible speeds. It became like walking through pigeons in the park, 
not even noticing they’re there. Some look a lot like us and blend in well, studying our 
languages and cultures, doing a physical now and then on a “volunteer.” They did 
sophisticated brain scans long before we even knew how electric we were.   
Mostly they maintained sentinels until—now, I don’t know this for a fact but we believe 
it’s the least unlikely hypothesis—we were on the brink of becoming a Second Level 
species. Then they paid closer attention. 
This is inference, I want to be clear about that. I know why I believe it but I can’t tell 
you. There’s too much back story, not all of it verifiable, and anyway, there isn’t time. I 
wish I had started telling the truth sooner.  
I was involved plenty but not at the top. Smarter people than me are managing this thing. 
We relate to one another through a compartmented matrix of need-to-know modules and 
comprise an elite managerial class. Of course, sometimes we’re as bumbling as 
humplings but we always forgive ourselves quickly. We have developed quite a confident 
culture after several generations of sanctioned protected malfeasance.  
But I digress. (I need to take a pill. Please wait). 
OK. Here’s an example you ought to be able to understand.  
Most of you use the Internet, right? OK, good.  
The Internet is a two-edged sword. Like speech or writing or printed words, any symbolic 
matrix invites projections. We empty the contents of our minds, our souls, even, onto the 
symbols. We can’t help it.  We reveal ourselves every time we communicate. The Net 
sucks everything out of us, good bad and indifferent. 
Bad guys use the net too. (We’re the good guys, remember; whoever we’re fighting is 
bad.) After Northwoods Two, when the war on terror cranked up and the flow of funds 
and the fear that fuels it was at a level needed to keep you guys manageable, the evil 
doers ramped up their use of the Net for all sorts of nefarious purposes. They planned 
attacks, moved money, communicated with stealth. Their web sites multiplied like 
roaches.  
5 
Now, that fact alone made humplings anxious, just knowing how fast the sites were 
growing. We amplified your fear by using the “nightly news” to do “in depth” features on 
terrorist web sites. They would show a few photos with a voiceover that distorted what 
viewers saw, added a few sound bites, hell, the entire text might be no more than eighty 
words, all designed to frighten you. Then ads would soothe you and you would go out 
and buy a ton of stuff.   
Some of you, however, quite predictably, became enraged. Fear turns to anger easily, 
especially in men afraid to feel fear. Then you have to do something to discharge the 
emotion. If you’re a hacker, you’ll attack those web sites, thinking you’re helping the 
cause. 
But invisible enemies are dangerous. We don’t want the web sites down. We want them 
up so we can track who visits, watch what they download, see who talks to who. It’s their 
highway, too, and that way we can track their cars.  
So when a well-intentioned humpling defaces or DOSes an enemy web site, we have to 
go in and put it back up. In the past, we invented anonymizers, built email programs like 
Hotmail and migrated them into the public domain, made all sorts of honeypots. Half the 
attractions out there, the most attractive attractions, we made. We have partnered from 
the beginning with the big guys, don’t you see. We built remote access into the chips, 
into all the hardware, in fact, even printers, as well as the software that’s now a platform 
for the business of the world. We go into telecom networks at the front door, sniff cables 
on the ocean floor, have thousands of redundant sensors in space to watch everything. 
You can’t sneak out for a cigarette but that we detect the smoke. We’re plugged in at the 
root, have back doors into most components—we don’t even intercept signals much 
anymore.  We just sit back and let the data come to us.  
The whole network is metered. If someone uses crypto, it’s already cracked, and the fact 
of its use tells us they’ve something to hide. We encourage paranoia by planting those 
stories, then fear makes people predictable, they go on automatic and they’re easy to 
track.  
Some of those bad guy sites were a real mess. They didn’t have a clue how to write code.  
We had to do remote administration, install fire walls, close holes, apply patches. 
Sometimes we kept the holes open, of course. That’s how we get in. So when some do-
gooder tells the world about a software flaw, we have to get to them right away and tell 
them to stop. Those holes are useful. You can’t exploit a secure Net. 
So well-intentioned humplings are a headache. They want to do good, when all we want 
them to do is nothing. We want them distracted. We don’t want partners. We don’t need 
partners. All we need are secrecy and the vast resources of potentates and kings.   
Stay with me, now. OK? I’m telling you this so I can show you what the aliens did. This 
has a point.

It’s not easy, I know. Humplings are not used to thinking outside the lines, and it’s hard 
for Americans anyway to understand other cultures. We don’t appreciate people who 
blow themselves up, for example. Even though we do it too. But we make it look 
different, like something Americans do. Then you don’t notice.
