Certainly! Here is an optimized version of the KQL (Kusto Query Language) query for detecting possible ransomware-related destruction activities. The query has been refined for clarity, readability, and professionalism:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where 
    (
        // Clearing shadow copies
        FileName =~ 'vssadmin.exe' and ProcessCommandLine has "delete shadows" and ProcessCommandLine has "/all" and ProcessCommandLine has "/quiet"
    )
    or (
        // Wiping drive free space
        FileName =~ 'cipher.exe' and ProcessCommandLine contains "/w"
    )
    or (
        // Disabling system restore task
        FileName =~ 'schtasks.exe' and ProcessCommandLine has "/change" and ProcessCommandLine has @"\Microsoft\Windows\SystemRestore\SR" and ProcessCommandLine has "/disable"
    )
    or (
        // Deleting USN journal
        FileName =~ 'fsutil.exe' and ProcessCommandLine has "usn" and ProcessCommandLine has "deletejournal" and ProcessCommandLine has "/d"
    )
    or (
        // Attempts to re-ACL all files on the C drive to give everyone full control
        FileName =~ 'icacls.exe' and ProcessCommandLine has @'"C:\*"' and ProcessCommandLine contains '/grant Everyone:F'
    )
    or (
        // PowerShell-based commands used to delete shadow copies
        FileName =~ 'powershell.exe' and (
            (
                ProcessCommandLine matches regex @'\s+-((?i)encod?e?d?c?o?m?m?a?n?d?|e|en|enc|ec)\s+'
                and replace(@'\x00', '', base64_decode_tostring(extract("[A-Za-z0-9+/]{50,}[=]{0,2}", 0, ProcessCommandLine))) matches regex @".*(Win32_Shadowcopy).*(.Delete\(\)).*"
            )
            or ProcessCommandLine matches regex @".*(Win32_Shadowcopy).*(.Delete\(\)).*"
        )
    )
```

### Explanation:
1. **Timestamp Filter**: The query filters events that occurred in the last 7 days.
2. **Clearing Shadow Copies**:
   - `vssadmin.exe` with command line arguments to delete all shadow copies quietly.
3. **Wiping Drive Free Space**:
   - `cipher.exe` with the `/w` option to wipe free space on the drive.
4. **Disabling System Restore Task**:
   - `schtasks.exe` with command line arguments to disable the system restore task.
5. **Deleting USN Journal**:
   - `fsutil.exe` with command line arguments to delete the USN journal.
6. **Re-ACL All Files on C Drive**:
   - `icacls.exe` with command line arguments to grant full control to everyone on all files in the C drive.
7. **PowerShell-Based Commands to Delete Shadow Copies**:
   - `powershell.exe` with encoded or plain command lines that attempt to delete shadow copies using `Win32_Shadowcopy`.

This query is designed to identify common patterns of destructive activity often associated with ransomware.
