### Figure 12: Communication Patterns

**Primary Communication Pattern:**
- An outstation transmits monitored data via I-format APDUs.
- The control server periodically acknowledges via S-format APDUs.

**Secondary (Redundant) Connection:**
- The outstation and control server exchange U16 and U32 APDUs (keep-alive messages followed by their acknowledgment).

**Investigation of Repeated APDUs:**
- The repeated APDUs were due to packet re-transmissions at the TCP layer, not unexpected behavior of the endpoints.

### Figure 13: Size of Markov Chains for All Connections

**Clusters:**
1. **Single Node and Edge (Point (1,1)):** Abnormal secondary connections.
2. **Square Cluster:** Connections with a variety of Markov chains.
3. **Ellipse Cluster:** Connections with a high number of edges, including the interrogation command (I100).

### Figure 14: Abnormal Communication Pattern

- **Description:** A sequence of repeated U16 messages sent by the server without the corresponding U32 acknowledgment from the outstation.
- **Connections Affected:** C2-O28, C2-O24, C1-O7, C1-O9, C1-O6, C1-O8, C1-O35, C2-O30, C1-O15, C1-O5.

### Figure 15: Communication Pattern with I100

- **Sequence:**
  - Server sends U1 STARTDT act.
  - Outstation acknowledges with U2 STARTDT con.
  - Server sends I100 interrogation command.
  - Outstation starts transmitting regular I-format APDUs (e.g., I13, I36).

### Figure 16: Markov Chains Showing Switchover

- **Switchover Indicators:**
  - Keep-alive messages in secondary connections (U16 and U32).
  - Initiation of a primary connection (U1 and U2), followed by I100 and multiple I-format messages.

### Table 6: Outstation Classification

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | No secondary connection and I-format only. |
| 2    | With secondary connection and U16&U32. |
| 3    | With secondary connection, I-format, and U16 only. |
| 4    | Single server with both I and U formats. |
| 5    | U-format only. |
| 6    | I-format only to both servers. |

### Figure 17: Simplified Interaction for Each Type

- **Type 1:** Only active connection to the primary control server.
- **Type 2:** Ideal situation with a primary and secondary connection.
- **Type 3:** Redundant equipment that transmits only U messages.
- **Type 4:** One active TCP connection at any given time, switching between servers.
- **Type 5:** Unique behavior with keep-alive/test-connection requests during I-format message transmissions.
- **Type 6:** Send I-messages to either C1 or C2, refusing redundant connections.

### Analysis Summary

- **Most Common Types:**
  - Type 3 (34.3%): Backup outstations.
  - Type 4: Outstations that switch connections between servers.
- **Hypothesis 4 Satisfied:** Small state machines are useful in identifying communication profiles.
- **Next Step:** Analyze the semantics of the payload.
