I generate new bundles using the console. Typically, the default path for a new bundle is `%root_dir%/src`. However, in my current situation, the new bundle is being saved in the cache folder: `app/cache/dev/src`. I suspect that this issue might be related to a recently added function called `removeAbsolutePathsFromContainer`.
