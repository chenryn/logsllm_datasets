**User:** Has anybody got a working example of using the `curses.textpad.Textbox` widget to edit existing text? This is, of course, in a Linux terminal (e.g., xterm).

**Assistant:**

To use the `curses.textpad.Textbox` widget for editing existing text in a Linux terminal, you can follow these steps. The `Textbox` class provides basic insert support, but you may need to add additional functionality, such as handling backspace.

Here is an example of how to set up a `Textbox` with existing text and enable basic editing, including backspace support:

```python
import curses
from curses import textpad

def main(stdscr):
    # Clear the screen and set up the initial text
    stdscr.clear()
    stdscr.refresh()

    # Create a window for the Textbox
    win = curses.newwin(5, 40, 0, 0)
    win.box()
    win.addstr(1, 1, "Initial text to edit")
    win.refresh()

    # Create a Textbox with insert mode enabled
    tb = textpad.Textbox(win, insert_mode=True)

    # Add a custom function to handle backspace
    def do_command(self, ch):
        if ch == 127 or ch == curses.KEY_BACKSPACE:
            self.do_backspace()
        else:
            textpad.Textbox.do_command(self, ch)

    tb.do_command = do_command.__get__(tb, textpad.Textbox)

    # Edit the text
    tb.edit()

    # Get the edited text
    message = tb.gather().strip()
    stdscr.addstr(6, 0, "Edited text: " + message)
    stdscr.getch()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    curses.wrapper(main)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Window Setup**: A new window (`win`) is created, and the initial text is added to it.
2. **Textbox Initialization**: A `Textbox` is created with `insert_mode=True` to allow text insertion.
3. **Backspace Handling**: A custom `do_command` method is defined to handle backspace (ASCII 127) and `curses.KEY_BACKSPACE`.
4. **Editing and Display**: The `edit` method is called to allow the user to edit the text, and the edited text is displayed below the window.

This example should work in a Linux terminal such as `xterm`. You can further customize the `do_command` method to handle other key bindings as needed.
