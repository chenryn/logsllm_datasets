**ATT&CK ID:** T1600.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Reduce Key Space

**Description:**
Adversaries may reduce the computational effort required to decrypt data transmitted over a network by weakening the encryption strength of the communications. This can be achieved by lowering the key space, which makes the encryption more susceptible to brute-force attacks and other cryptographic vulnerabilities.
