## Abstract
Online meeting tools such as Zoom and Google Meet have become essential for professional, educational, and personal use. However, this has also opened up new avenues for large-scale harassment, particularly through a phenomenon known as zoombombing, where attackers join online meetings to disrupt and harass participants. In this paper, we conduct the first data-driven analysis of calls for zoombombing attacks on social media. We identify ten popular online meeting tools and extract posts containing meeting invitations from Twitter and 4chan. We then perform manual annotation to identify posts calling for zoombombing and apply thematic analysis to better characterize the discussion surrounding these calls. During the first seven months of 2020, we identified over 200 calls for zoombombing across both platforms. Our findings indicate that the majority of these calls are made by insiders with legitimate access to the meetings, particularly students in high school and college classes. This has significant security implications, as common protections like password protection are rendered ineffective. Additionally, insiders often instruct attackers to adopt the names of legitimate participants to evade detection, making other countermeasures less effective. Based on our observations, we argue that the only effective defense against zoombombing is creating unique join links for each participant.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet's early promise was to enable quick, easy, and real-time communication, not just via text but also through audio and video. Today, numerous online meeting tools like Skype, Zoom, and Google Meet are used in various contexts, both personal and professional. The COVID-19 pandemic has further increased reliance on these tools, with many business meetings, online classes, and social gatherings moving online. Unfortunately, this mass adoption has also enabled a new form of attack known as zoombombing, where perpetrators deliberately disrupt virtual meetings. To mitigate this threat, security practitioners have proposed best practices, such as requiring passwords, setting up waiting rooms, and not sharing meeting links publicly. However, these measures are not always effective, especially against motivated insiders. 

In this paper, we perform the first measurement study of calls for zoombombing attacks on social media. We selected ten popular online meeting services and analyzed their security features. We then identified posts containing meeting information on Twitter and 4chan, focusing on calls for zoombombing. Between January and July 2020, we identified 12,000 tweets and 434 4chan threads discussing online meeting rooms. We applied thematic qualitative analysis to identify 123 4chan threads and 95 tweets calling for zoombombing. We then conducted a mixed-methods analysis, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to better understand the zoombombing phenomenon and the effectiveness of existing countermeasures.

### Key Findings
- **Targeted Meetings**: The majority of zoombombing calls target online lectures (74% on 4chan and 59% on Twitter), with evidence of both universities and high schools being targeted.
- **Insider Threats**: Most calls for zoombombing come from insiders with legitimate access to the meetings (70% on 4chan and 82% on Twitter). This makes password protection ineffective, as attackers can share the passwords.
- **Real-Time Attacks**: Almost all calls for zoombombing target meetings happening in real time (93% on 4chan and 98% on Twitter), suggesting that these attacks are opportunistic and difficult to predict.

**Disclaimer**: Due to the nature of zoombombing, some of the content included in this paper may be offensive and upsetting.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Threat Model
We consider a zoombombing attack to consist of four phases:
1. **Call for Attack**: An insider, often a legitimate participant, obtains information about the meeting and posts it on an online service, inviting others to join and disrupt the meeting.
2. **Coordination**: The post becomes a hub for attackers, who share additional information and coordinate the attack.
3. **Delivery**: Attackers join the meeting and harass participants through various means, such as sending hateful messages or displaying offensive content.
4. **Harm**: The goal is to cause psychological or even physical harm to the participants.

### 2.2 Online Meeting Services
To select a representative set of online meeting tools, we conducted Google searches and vetted the results. The ten highest-ranked services are: Zoom, Hangouts, Google Meet, Skype, Jitsi, GotoMeeting, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, Bluejeans, and Starleaf. We describe their general characteristics and analyze their security features, focusing on what makes them targets for zoombombing and how to reduce the risk of successful attacks.
