Abstract— Online meeting tools like Zoom and Google Meet
have become central to our professional, educational, and per-
sonal lives. This has opened up new opportunities for large scale
harassment. In particular, a phenomenon known as zoombomb-
ing has emerged, in which aggressors join online meetings with
the goal of disrupting them and harassing their participants. In
this paper, we conduct the ﬁrst data-driven analysis of calls for
zoombombing attacks on social media. We identify ten popular
online meeting tools and extract posts containing meeting invita-
tions to these platforms on a mainstream social network, Twitter,
and on a fringe community known for organizing coordinated
attacks against online users, 4chan. We then perform manual
annotation to identify posts that are calling for zoombombing at-
tacks, and apply thematic analysis to develop a codebook to better
characterize the discussion surrounding calls for zoombombing.
During the ﬁrst seven months of 2020, we identify over 200 calls
for zoombombing between Twitter and 4chan, and analyze these
calls both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our ﬁndings indicate
that the vast majority of calls for zoombombing are not made
by attackers stumbling upon meeting invitations or bruteforcing
their meeting ID, but rather by insiders who have legitimate
access to these meetings, particularly students in high school
and college classes. This has important security implications
because it makes common protections against zoombombing, e.g.,
password protection, ineffective. We also ﬁnd instances of insiders
instructing attackers to adopt the names of legitimate participants
in the class to avoid detection, making countermeasures like
setting up a waiting room and vetting participants less effective.
Based on these observations, we argue that the only effective
defense against zoombombing is creating unique join links for
each participant.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the earliest promises of the Internet was to enable
quick, easy, and real-time communications, not just via text,
but also audio and video. While it took some time, there
are now numerous online meeting tools like Skype, Zoom,
and Google Meet
that are used in a variety of contexts,
both personal and professional. In 2020, society has found
itself increasingly reliant on these online meeting tools due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, with many business meetings,
online classes, and even social gatherings moving online.
Unfortunately, the mass adoption of these services has also
enabled a new kind of attack where perpetrators join and
deliberately disrupt virtual meetings. This phenomenon has
been dubbed zoombombing, after one of the most used online
meeting platforms [6, 49].
To mitigate the threat of zoombombing, security practi-
tioners have begun discussing best practices to prevent these
attacks from happening or limit their effects. These include

requiring a password to join online meetings, setting up a
waiting room and manually vetting participants before letting
them in, and not sharing meeting links publicly [11, 55].
While helpful to keep out casual and unmotivated attackers,
there is an inherent tension between tightening the security
of online meeting rooms and the need for them to be easily
accessible to a number of people, especially in the case of large
public events [6]. Most importantly, devising effective security
policies requires a good understanding of the capabilities of
attackers and their modus operandi. To date, however, the
research community lacks a good understanding of how zoom-
bombing attacks are called for and how they are carried out.
For example, it remains unclear how attackers obtain meeting
links in the ﬁrst place. This type of knowledge is crucial
because, for example, protecting against attackers proactively
bruteforcing the ID of meeting rooms is very different (and
calls for different countermeasures) than mitigating attacks
called for by insiders.
In this paper, we perform the ﬁrst measurement study of
calls for zoombombing attacks on social media. We ﬁrst select
ten popular online meeting services, spanning a wide range of
target users, from businesses to individuals. We then analyze
the security features that these services offer to their users,
with a particular focus on the mechanisms that allow them
to restrict and control who can join and participate in the
meeting. We next identify posts that contain online meeting
information. We decide to focus on two online services for this
purpose, a mainstream social network, Twitter, and a fringe
Web community, 4chan, which previous work showed is often
involved in harassment attacks against online users [23, 33].
Between January and July 2020, we identify 12k tweets and
434 4chan threads discussing online meeting rooms. We then
apply thematic qualitative analysis [47] to identify posts that
are indeed calling for a zoombombing attack, and to further
characterize them. We identify 123 4chan threads discussing
such attacks and 95 tweets. We then adopt a mixed methods
approach to perform further analysis. We ﬁrst analyze this
dataset quantitatively, looking at temporal properties of posts
and apply natural language processing techniques to better
understand the topics of discussion. We then dig deeper into
our qualitative analysis results to get a more nuanced view
of the zoombombing phenomenon. Finally, we discuss our
ﬁndings in view of existing countermeasures, reasoning about
their effectiveness.
In summary, we make the following key ﬁndings:
• The majority of the calls for zoombombing in our dataset

upon meeting rooms and disrupting them are out of scope. In
the following, we describe the four phases in detail through an
example in which Charlie is orchestrating a coordinated attack
against a Zoom meeting created by Alice.
i) Call for attack. Charlie obtains information about Alice’s
Zoom meeting. As we will show later, this is often because
Charlie is a legitimate participant of the meeting (e.g., a
student in an online lecture). Charlie then posts information
about the Zoom meeting on an online service of his choice
(starting an organization thread), asking other members of
the community to participate in a coordinated attack. Previous
research showed that attacks like this are often organized on
polarized Web communities (e.g., /pol/, 4chan’s Politically
Incorrect Board), where the person calling for an attack posts
a link to content on another service that was created by
the victim (e.g., a Zoom meeting), followed by an invite
to the person (e.g., through the phrase “you know what to
do”) [23, 33].
ii) Coordination. The organization thread created by Charlie
now becomes an aggregation point for attackers, who will
report additional information and coordinate the attack by
replying to the thread. For example, attackers will post details
like a password to access the meeting or personal information
about the host.
iii) Delivery. The attackers will then join the online meeting
and harass the participants, for example sending them hateful
messages, shouting profanities, or displaying offensive or
indecent images through their webcams [6].
iv) Harm. The goal of the attack is to cause harm to the group
of people. Depending on its success and intensity, victims
could suffer serious psychological [16, 22] or even physical
harm [32].
B. Online Meeting Services
To select a representative set of online meeting tools to
study in this paper, we ran Google queries for “online meeting
services” and manually vetted the results for Web pages that
actually advertise a service (excluding, for example, news
articles talking about a certain meeting platform). After this
process, we obtained the list of the ten highest ranked meeting
tools. These services are Zoom, Hangouts, Google Meet,
Skype, Jitsi, GotoMeeting, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex,
Bluejeans, and Starleaf.
In the following, we describe the general characteristics of
each of these services (see Table I). We then analyze the
security relevant features offered by the various platforms
(e.g., whether they allow hosts to set a password for meetings).
We are particularly interested in understanding what charac-
teristics of a service might make it a popular target platform
for attackers, or might reduce the risk for a successful attack.
Length of operation. Half of our ten services were established
after 2010, with the notable exception of Webex which started
in the 90s. Major tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and
Cisco have their own solution, with Microsoft and Google hav-
ing two of them (Skype and Teams for Microsoft and Hangouts
and Meet for Google). While Google started retiring Hangouts
Figure 1: Threat Model for a zoombombing attack. Charlie calls for
an attack against a Zoom meeting created by Alice, by creating a
thread on an online service (e.g., 4chan). Participants then join the
Zoom meeting, report back on the thread about the status of the
attack, and harm the legitimate participants to the meeting.
ter). We ﬁnd evidence of both universities and high
schools being targeted.
• Most calls for zoombombing come from insiders who
have legitimate access to the meetings (70% on 4chan and
82% on Twitter). This has serious security implications,
because it makes passwords ineffective to protect the
meeting rooms as attackers can share them with whoever
participates in the attack. In some cases we ﬁnd that the
insider shares additional information like names of real
students in the class, allowing participants to select those
names and make it difﬁcult for teachers and moderators
to identify intruders.
• Almost all calls for zoombombing target meetings hap-
pening in real time (93% on 4chan and 98% on Twitter),
suggesting that these attacks happen in an opportunistic
fashion and that defenders cannot prepare for zoombomb-
ings by identifying posts ahead of time.
Disclaimer. Due to their nature, zoombombing messages on
social media are likely highly offensive. In this paper we do
not censor any content, therefore we warn the reader that some
of the quotes included in the following sections are likely to
be upsetting and offensive.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the threat model that we
assume for this paper. We then describe how we chose the ten
meeting services that we study, and describe their features.
A. Threat Model
We consider a zoombombing attack as being composed of
four phases (see Figure 1), based on anecdotal evidence of how
zoombombing accounts unfold, as well as following empirical
evidence reported by previous research that studied coordi-
nated online aggression, trolling, and harassment on other so-
cial media platforms (e.g., Reddit, YouTube) [15, 23, 28, 34].
Note that in this paper we focus on calls for attacks that aim
at attracting multiple participants; single attackers stumbling
