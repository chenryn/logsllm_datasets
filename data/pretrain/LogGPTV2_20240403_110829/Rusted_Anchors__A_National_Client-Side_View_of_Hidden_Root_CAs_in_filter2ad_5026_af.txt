been demonstrated, for example, public key sharing, abuse of wild-
cards and long validity period are prevalent.
In general, our study suggests that the community should im-
mediately review the security of the local root store, and seek a
security best practice to notify client users in the event of root store
modification.

APPENDIX
A CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION CODES
To verify a certificate chain, 360 Secure Browser calls APIs of un-
derlying operating systems (e.g., cryptoAPI) which return all ver-
ification errors that occur in a double-word value. The errors are
then recorded as STATUS_CODE in the collected certificate records.
Table 9 shows all certificate verification errors in STATUS_CODE that
are captured in our dataset.

Description
commonName of leaf certificate does not
match the given hostname.
Certificate is out of its validity period.
Root certificate is not trusted by local
operating system.
Certificate is malformed.
Cannot check the revocation status of
certificate.
Certificate is revoked.
Invalidation due to other reasons.
Certificate uses a signature algorithm
weaker than the API’s requirements.
Certificate uses a key weaker than the
API’s requirements.
Pinned public key is not in the
certificate chain.
CA signs certificate to subjects out of
its name constraints.
Certificate’s validity period is longer
than the API’s requirements.
Certificate has compliance failures
with CT policies.
