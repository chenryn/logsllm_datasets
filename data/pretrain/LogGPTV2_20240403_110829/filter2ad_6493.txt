cannot both be faster than exhaustive search if and only if
the IV length is at least as long as the key length.
For the sake of comparison, we prove the following propo-
sition. From here, we see that our attack, which allows
for faster pre-processing, is more eﬀective than the
HS-TMD and DK-TMD attacks. It also imposes a
more stringent constraint on the length of the IV
for adequate security.
Proposition 1.
1. In the BS-TMD attack [1] on a
stream cipher, if the state size is at least 3/2 times
the key length, then the pre-processing and online at-
tack complexity cannot both be faster than exhaustive
search.
2. In the HS-TMD attack [8] on a stream cipher, if the IV
length v is at least half the key length k, then the pre-
processing and online attack complexity cannot both be
faster than exhaustive search.
3. In the DK-TMD attack [5] on a stream cipher, the pre-
processing complexity is at least the exhaustive search
complexity irrespective of the IV length.
Remark 1. Although the authors of [8] recommended the
IV to be at least as long as the key, that is because they allow
the precomputation time to be worse than exhaustive search
in their estimation.

In comparison, the current

known attacks on Grain-v1 cannot break it with both pre-
processing and online attack complexity faster than exhaus-
tive search. For example, the conditional diﬀerential crypt-
analysis of [9] only breaks 104 out of 160 initialization rounds
of Grain-v1. It can also be veriﬁed that the time-memory-
data trade-oﬀ attacks of Biryukov-Shamir, Hong-Sarkar and
Dunkelman-Keller [1, 8, 5] all have pre-computation com-
plexity worse than exhaustive search. Bjorstad [2] tried to
improve the Biryukov-Shamir time-memory-data trade-oﬀ
attack on Grain-v1, by using a guess-and-determine attack

1. A NEW TIME-MEMORY-DATA TRADE-
OFF ATTACK
In this paper, we introduce a new time-memory-data trade-
oﬀ attack which can perform better than existing ones by
Biryukov-Shamir (BS-TMD [1]), Hong-Sarkar (HS-TMD [8])
and Dunkelman-Keller (DK-TMD [5]). Current Estream ci-
phers are resistant to these attacks because the state size is
too big for the BS-TMD attack, while the pre-processing is
at least as expensive as exhaustive search for the HS-TMD
and DK-TMD attacks.
In contrast, our attack can have both the pre-processing
and online attack complexity faster than exhaustive search
when applied to Estream ciphers. The idea is to break up
the available online data complexity into two parts: DIV to
be the number of IV re-syncs, and Dsingle to be the num-
ber of keystream bits available for each IV. We essentially
get the same trade-oﬀ curve as the Biryukov-Shamir attack:
P = N/D where D = DIV Dsingle and N = KV ; and on-
line attack complexity T = D + Tsingle where Tsingle =
). The attack is subjected to the conditions
N
V ≥ DIV , and Tsingle ≥ D

single. The attack is described
in Section 3 of our paper and its eﬀectiveness is captured in
our main theorem below:

Theorem 1. Consider a stream cipher with Key Space
1. If v ≥ k and we require the online attack complexity to
satisfy T  K.
2. If v < k, then the pre-processing and online complexity
of the attack in Section 3 of our paper can both be faster
than exhaustive search, i.e. P, T < K.
From Theorem 1, we have the following corollary:

ciphers such as Grain-v1, Rabbit, Salsa20, SOSEMANUK
and MICKEY; and also the block ciphers such as Rijndael,
Serpent, Twoﬁsh, RC6, MARS, IDEA, SAFER SK-128 and
KASUMI in CBC, CFB, OFB and counter modes of opera-
tion.
We have not explored other areas where TMD attack
can be applied, such as, attacking block ciphers in a multi-
user setting, inverting cryptographic hash functions, break-
ing Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and attacking
public key cryptography like NTRUEncrypt and generic sig-
nature schemes suggested in [8]. We will leave these as open
problems and future work.

We apply our attack to the stream cipher Grain-128 [6]
pre-processing and
with 128-bit key and break it with 2
online attack complexity. In comparison, the current
2
known attacks on Grain-128 cannot break it with both pre-
processing and online attack complexity faster than exhaus-
tive search. For example, the conditional diﬀerential crypt-
analysis of [9] only breaks 213 out of 256 initialization rounds
of Grain-128, while the dynamic cube attack [4] breaks it
of the possible keys, and not the full
for a subset of 2
key space.
It can also be veriﬁed that the time-memory-
data trade-oﬀ attacks of Biryukov-Shamir, Hong-Sarkar and
Dunkelman-Keller [1, 8, 5] all have pre-computation com-
plexity worse than exhaustive search.

and 2
Based on the framework presented in [8, Section 4 and Ta-
ble 1], block cipher in modes of operation like CBC, CFB,
OFB and counter modes can be analyzed by TMD attacks.
In [8], AES-192 and AES-256 are attacked with online com-
respectively. However, their attack
plexities of 2
did not take pre-computation time into account.
If taken
respectively
into consideration, they are P = 2
for AES-192 and AES-256, which is worse than exhaustive
search. In Section 5 of this paper, we attack AES-192 with
; and AES-

256 with pre-computation 2
We also showed that the chaining structure of block cipher
in modes of operation allows us ﬂexibility in choosing the
number of resyncs DIV and amount of keystream per resync
Dsingle for our attack.

We applied our attack to break various Estream cipehrs
and block cipher modes of operation while the existing TMD
attacks cannot apply. The results are summarized in Tables

3. CONCLUSION
We have proposed a new time-memory-data trade-oﬀ at-
tack that performs better than existing ones. We prove that
both pre-processing and online attack complexity are faster
than exhaustive search whenever the IV length is less than
