7.5 Route Manipulation
To explore route manipulation, we utilize a well-known exchange point’s
route server that uses communities to control route redistribution. Not
only does PEERING connect to this route server, it also provides a public
per-peer view of the accepted prefixes and communities. This route server
is a particularly attractive target as it publicly documents its community
evaluation order and route server configurations ś a policy common among
neutral IXPs for transparency [1, 5, 19].
Experiment: From PEERING, we first sent our prefix with a community
that instructs the route server to redistribute the route to a particular
attackee AS. We then sent the prefix with this community and a com-
munity that suppresses advertisement to the attackee AS. Because these
communities conflict, the resulting behavior exposes the route server
configuration.
Validation: We utilize the looking glass of the attackee to determine
whether or not the prefix was redistributed by the route server. Prior to
sending the conflicting communities, we observe the announcement at
the route server, whereas during the attack it is not present.
Summary: While we originated and tagged a prefix using an injection
point that is a direct peer of the target route server, this is not a funda-
mental limitation. However, it does demonstrate that an intermediate
provider, upon observing a community for the route server, can add a
conflicting community to exploit the evaluation order in a similar fash-
ion. Furthermore, because this route server has hundreds of peers, the
potential impact can be large.
7.6 Applicability in the Wild
To obtain a more complete understanding of the real-world potential to
mount remote community-based blackholing attacks, we conduct an au-
tomated experiment that explores the impact of each of the 307 verified
blackhole communities identified in [36]. We employ the PEERING testbed
to advertise a /24 prefix assigned to us (p), and RIPE Atlas to send active
probes to this prefix between August 28 and September 1, 2018.
Specifically, for each community c in the set of blackhole communities,
we: 1) advertise p without communities; 2) issue Atlas ICMP probes from
200 vantage points toward p; 3) advertise p with community c; 4) re-issue
the same Atlas ICMP probes. Between each step, we wait five minutes to
allow routing to converge, and for the Atlas probe requests to finish. The
set of 200 Atlas vantage points is randomly chosen, but constant across all
measurements. We then fetch the probing results and compare responses on
a per-vantage point basis. We find 25 distinct communities (8.1%) that induce
at least one vantage point to be fully responsive prior to advertising the
community and then unresponsive once c is attached to the advertisement.
These 25 communities affect a total of 48 (24%) of the vantage points.
To confirm that the community is the cause of the dropped Atlas probes,
rather than some transient network event, we re-ran the experiment two
days later. The results from this second round of probing exactly matched
the first ś suggesting that the root cause of the behavior we observe is
indeed due to the blackhole communities being accepted and acted upon by
various ASes along the path.
Finally, we issue traceroutes from all of the Atlas vantage points to
our prefix p and use a current routeview routing table to naïvely map
router interfaces to AS numbers. We then determine a lower-bound on
the number of AS hops that the blackhole community traverses by finding
the community’s target AS in the path. 13 of 74 community-path pairs
receive the blackhole community directly, i.e., the PEERING AS directly
peers with the community’s target AS. Four of the pairs involve two AS
hops, while one involves three AS hops. Fully 75% of the community-path
pairs that experience blocking due to the blackhole community did not have
the community’s target AS on the path, either because of non-AS specific
communities (e.g., 65535:666) or due to inaccurate IP-to-AS mapping. These
results largely confirm our passive measurements. While the ASes directly
connected to PEERING are expected to honor the advertised communities,
we find further evidence of communities propagating multiple hops and
being acted upon.
In addition to the testing of previously inferred blackhole communities,
we note that the automated framework we describe here can also be used
to gain confidence that a particular community is indeed used by a provider
290

as a label for RTBH. This is particularly important when using machine
learning or other statistical inference techniques to identify communities.
For instance, while [36] found 307 verifiable blackhole communities, an
additional 115 were labeled as likely communities. In future work we plan
to test these additional communities.
Limitations: Similarly, we wish in the future to perform automated
active experiments using non-RTBH communities to better understand
their behavior. Such experiments require more complex inference as the
resulting behavior can be subtle and hard to detect (e.g., a path change) as
compared to RTBH where reachability is a binary test. Moreover, following
the PEERING AUP we are not allowed to conduct an automated experiment
for traffic steering and route manipulation attacks as they can trigger path
changes that can potentially impact the operation of the involved networks.
7.7 Other observations
In the process of running experiments in the wild, we find that it is possible
to inject seemingly contradictory communities. As a case study, we inject
fake location communities, i.e., communities used to tag a prefix’s ingress
reception point. We then observe the prefix at remote collectors labeled with
communities indicating reception on different continents. Speaking with
one large operator, we confirm that this will not disrupt the overall operation,
as only a few customers will be affected. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude
that other operators may rely on community-based location information in
unanticipated ways, e.g., for traffic engineering or other operations.
8 DISCUSSION
BGP communities: Have we gone too far? The effectively global propa-
gation of community tags allows attacks as shown above. On the other hand,
BGP communities are used by network operators to implement policies and
may add useful additional information, e.g., when debugging a network.
They provide a low overhead simple communication channel between ASes.
As such, they are widely in use. However, based on our interaction with
the Internet operators community we gather, the scope of relevance for
most communities is one or two hops. Based on that the Internet operators
community needs to decide whether the benefits of easy communication
outweigh the risks for potential attacks. An extreme way of preventing
the kinds of attacks outlined in this paper would be the following: an AS
only propagates communities which are useful to the receiving peer. To
exemplify, AS1 should send to AS2 only communities of the form 2:xxx.
Au contraire, if AS2 is a route collector, such as RIPE RIS or Route Views,
AS1 might not filter.
Be aware of standardized BGP communities: As we have shown with
the remote blackhole attacks above, there are drawbacks for standardiz-
ing well-known transitive communities which have possibly disruptive
semantics. On the other hand, those which are purely informative are much
less of a concern. Having highly useful active communities not globally
published might be called security through obscurity. Although, as we have
shown, having a highly active community globally known makes life too
easy for the attacker. As such, every operator of a network with known
BGP communities and active semantics should be aware of the potential
ramifications and have appropriate countermeasures in place, e.g., BGP
community filters.
Need for BGP communities authentication: Clearly there is a strong
need for the authentication of the right to attach a community to an an-
nouncement or modify one in transit. Unfortunately, there are no known
means to do this. Moreover, adoption of authentication in Internet proto-
cols has been shown to be a slow process, despite the critical role that the
Internet plays in today’s economy and society.
Monitoring the hygiene of BGP communities use: Abuse of commu-
nities might be discouraged by monitoring from the points of view of global
BGP collectors such as RIPE RIS and Route Views, analogous to what is
being done for BGP hijacks today. This strategy comes with all the problems
of BGP monitoring: there is no global BGP view and route collectors only
see the announcement they receive. The latter inferences on what happens
on the path between the origin and the collector very difficult. In addition,
the lack of structural semantics of BGP communities leaves a lot of room for
misinterpretations. Of course, well known communities can and should be
monitored. Yet, this only covers a small fraction of the available community
space. Of course, monitoring BGP community behavior is not an active
defense; but attribution of abuse might strongly discourage abuse.
Need for proper documentation: Similar to what is ongoing for bogon
and other filtering, the operational community should publish and update
well tested best current practices and configuration patterns for community
generation, propagation, action semantics, etc.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we measure the increasing use and propagation of BGP commu-
nities and demonstrate the resulting increase in exposure to abuse by remote
parties; e.g., to blackhole prefixes, steer traffic, and manipulate routes. A
key insight is that a significant fraction of transit providers, more than 14%,
forward received communities onward. Given the rich interconnectivity of
the Internet, this means that communities effectively propagate globally.
Attacks are possible due in part to ill-defined BGP community semantics,
error-prone configurations, as well as lack of cryptographic integrity and
authentication for BGP communities.
By analyzing BGP announcements at many collectors worldwide we
observe that, indeed, the propagation of communities is a global Internet
phenomenon which enables routing vulnerabilities at scale. We tested the
feasibility of BGP community-based attacks in lab experiments, then com-
ment on the possibilities to launch such attacks in the wild. Unfortunately,
such BGP attacks are successful even without prefix hijacking and even
if BGP authentication is used. We highlight the need to increase aware-
ness among current and future users of BGP communities regarding their
possible abuse cases. We conclude that BGP communities are yet another
highly used BGP feature which can, yet again, yield many unintended
consequences.
As part of our future agenda we want to investigate ways to infer in-
stances of any of the three types of BGP community-based attacks using
passive measurements. This requires the development of a new methodol-
ogy that assigns the role of the tagger of the BGP community to a network
with the intent to perform one of the attacks described in the paper. Notice
that both the relative position of the network in the path and the BGP com-
munity that it tags have to be considered for this inference. Identifying an
attacker in BGP is not trivial due to the lack of authentication and integrity.
We also want to investigate other types of BGP community-based attacks
and assess their feasibility.
