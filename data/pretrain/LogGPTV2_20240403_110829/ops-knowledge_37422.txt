User: How to use Docker to create a containerized MySQL database and persist the data locally?
Assistant: The following are the steps to create a containerized MySQL database and persist the data locally: 1. Install Docker (if not already installed) and start Docker. 2. Search for available MySQL images. Execute the following command: ```shell docker search mysql ``` Select the appropriate MySQL image, such as "mysql:5.7". 3. Create a MySQL container. Execute the following command: ```shell docker run --name mysql_container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password> -v <host_path>:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql:5.7 ``` is explained as follows: - --name mysql_container is The name of the container. - -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password> is the password of the specified MySQL root user. - -v <host_path>:/var/lib/mysql Mount the local disk path to the data directory of the MySQL database in the container to achieve data persistence. 4. Connect to the MySQL container. Execute the following command: ```shell docker exec -it mysql_container bash ``` After executing the above command, you will enter the terminal of the MySQL container. 5. Start the MySQL service. Execute the following command: ```shell service mysql start ``` 6. Connect to the MySQL database. Execute the following command: ```shell mysql -u root -p ``` Enter the password to log in to the MySQL database. Now, a containerized MySQL database has been created and the data is persisted locally. The data can be manipulated in the MySQL container, and the data can also be viewed locally. In order to stop the container, the following command can be used: ```shell docker stop mysql_container ``` To restart the container, the following command can be used: ```shell docker start mysql_container ```
