User: How to share files between multiple Linux servers using Network Mapping Protocol (NFS)?
Assistant: Network Mapping Protocol (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol designed to share files and directories on a network. Linux users can use NFS to share files between multiple Linux servers. Here are the steps to share files between multiple Linux servers using NFS: 1. Install NFS server and client software: Install NFS server and client software on all servers. On Ubuntu and Debian, you can use the following command to install the software: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common 2. Create the directory that needs to be shared: Create the directory that needs to be shared on the NFS server, For example: sudo mkdir /nfs_share 3. Configure NFS share: Open the /etc/exports file on the NFS server and add the following line: /nfs_share 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) Among them, /nfs_share is the directory to be shared , 192.168.1.0/24 is the network address that allows access to NFS shares, rw indicates that the share is readable/writeable, sync indicates synchronous writing, and no_subtree_check indicates that subdirectories are not checked. 4. Restart the NFS service: On the NFS server, run the following command to restart the NFS service and apply the changes: sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server 5. Mount the NFS share: On the NFS client, use the mount command to mount Mount the NFS share: sudo mount nfs_server:/nfs_share /mnt/nfs_share Among them, nfs_server is the host name or IP address of the NFS server, /nfs_share is the shared directory to be mounted, and /mnt/nfs_share is the local directory where the mounted directory is placed. 6. Test the NFS share: On the NFS client, you can use the ls command to view the files in the mounted directory. If you need to set up a share between multiple NFS clients, repeat steps 5 and 6.
