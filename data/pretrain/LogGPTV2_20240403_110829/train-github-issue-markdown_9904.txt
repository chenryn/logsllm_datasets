It appears that only some of the image ops (e.g.
`tf.image.random_saturation()`) only accept single images (rank-3 tensors),
while others allow batches of images (rank-4 tensors). Should this be made
more consistent so that all image ops allow for higher-rank tensors? There
doesn't seem to be much about this in the API documentation (some ops just say
that the last dimension needs to be 3).
