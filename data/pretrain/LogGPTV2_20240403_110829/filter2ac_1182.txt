### Title: Blackhat Asia 2019 - Don't Eat Spaghetti with a Spoon: An Analysis of the Practical Value of Threat Intelligence

**Abstract:**

Threat Intelligence is a well-regarded concept that plays a crucial role in a mature security operation. However, like many good ideas in the cybersecurity industry, its commercialization has led to over-simplification and commoditization, potentially undermining its effectiveness.

True intelligence should provide non-obvious, actionable, and value-added information, derived through sophisticated processing and interpretation. In reality, most commercial threat intelligence products operate on a basic premise: if an entity has been observed engaging in malicious activity in one location, it is likely to do so in other locations as well. Based on this assumption, threat intelligence feeds are sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. But does this approach actually work?

This presentation will analyze the effectiveness of threat intelligence in predicting malicious activities on the Internet. Our study involves the investigation of over a million Internet threat indicators over a six-month period. We utilized a diverse set of sensors deployed across real-world networks to track various types of malicious activities, including port scans, web application scans, DoS & DDoS attacks, and exploits.

We focused on tracking the behavior of detected malicious IP addresses over time, examining both 'horizontal' and 'vertical' correlations:
- **Horizontal Correlations:** The ability of one sensor to predict activity on another sensor, or one target to predict activity on another.
- **Vertical Correlations:** The ability of a sensor to predict the persistence or re-appearance of a specific IP indicator.

By analyzing these correlations, we aim to shed light on the practical value of basic threat intelligence offerings. This will help us better understand their role and significance within our security systems and processes.
