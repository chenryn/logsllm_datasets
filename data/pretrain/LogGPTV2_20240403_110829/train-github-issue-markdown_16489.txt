In my app, I have a Recycler view with GridLayoutManager. The code I am using
to load images bindImage method of recycler view adapter:
    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ImageViewHolder holder, int position) {
        GSImage dbImage = mLandscapeImagesList.get(position);
        File imageFile = new File(mImageDirectoryFile, dbImage.getImageName());
        Glide.with(MyImageFragement.this).load(imageFile).centerCrop().into(holder.imageView);
        int indexInSelectedImagesSet = mSelectedLandscapeImages.indexOf(dbImage);
        if (indexInSelectedImagesSet>-1){
            holder.itemView.setSelected(true);
        } else {
            holder.itemView.setSelected(false);
        }
    }
The Cell layout I am using is:
Here AspectRatioImageView(subclass of ImageView) automatically resizes the
height of image view according to the provided aspect ratio.
The above code is working fine on my devices (Xiaomi MiPad, ViewSonic Tablet,
Android emaulators and Samsung Galaxy S3) but is not working correctly on my
client's device (Samsung 10.1 inch tablet).  
In his end, images are being duplicated in the recycler grid. Also the the
duplicates mostly occurs in adjacent recycler grid positions. I can't share
any code as I even unable to reproduce the issue on my devices.
Do you guys have any idea what could the cause of this? Can you please suggest
me any thing that I can try?
Thanks
