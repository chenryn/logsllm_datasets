No WAN‚Äôs Land: Mapping U.S. Broadband Coverage with Millions of Address Queries to ISPs
IMC ‚Äô20, October 27‚Äì29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
A MAJOR ISPS AS LOCAL ISPS IN CERTAIN
STATES
While major ISPs together cover over 90% of the population of the
states that we study (according to FCC data), not every major ISP
provides service to every state. In addition, in 8 of the 9 states, at
least one major ISP provides coverage to only a small fraction of
the state‚Äôs total population. Querying BATs at scale is resource- and
time-intensive, so for each ISP, we prioritize querying addresses in
states where the ISP has the greatest coverage. In a state where a ma-
jor ISP has lesser coverage, we do not collect BAT coverage data for
that ISP in that state. We omit that state-ISP combination from our
evaluation of per-ISP coverage overstatements (Section 4.1), and we
treat the ISP as a local ISP in that state for our estimate of per-state
coverage overstatements (Section 4.3). We use the same approach
for the remainder of our analysis in Section 4 and Appendix I.
In Table 7, we present the states where each major ISP provides
coverage according to Form 477 data, as well as whether we treat
the ISP as a major or local ISP for that state. Where we treat an ISP
as a local ISP for a state, we estimate the population covered by
that ISP in that state by identifying census blocks that are covered
in the Form 477 data, filtering out census blocks that are not in
the NAD (and consequently not represented in our dataset), and
then summing the population of the remaining census blocks. We
also show the ISP‚Äôs coverage in the state as a proportion of the
population that has any broadband access, using the per-state FCC
covered population estimates in Table 12 (where we do not filter
census blocks based on BAT responses).
The evaluation in Table 7 shows that the gap in BAT data collec-
tion is small in comparison to state covered populations, and as a
result, likely does not have a significant impact on our estimates
of per-state broadband availability overstatements. In 13 of the 15
state-ISP pairs for which we do not collect BAT data, the gap in
BAT data represents less than 2.6% of the state population with
broadband access, and no gap exceeds 8% of the covered population.
The results in Table 7 also suggest that the gap in BAT data
collection does not have a significant impact on our estimates of
per-ISP coverage overstatement ratios. For each ISP, the population
for which we do not collect BAT responses is small in comparison to
the population for which we do collect BAT responses (roughly the
population covered by the ISP according to FCC data in Table 3, but
the value is slightly larger because the table omits certain census
blocks). Furthermore, because we entirely omit state-ISP combi-
nations that lack BAT data collection from our per-ISP coverage
analysis‚Äîrather than making an assumption about coverage, as
we do for our per-state analysis‚Äîthe consequence for estimating
per-ISP overstatement ratios is solely a smaller and less diverse
sample of addresses where we measure BAT responses.
B ALTICE AS A LOCAL ISP
We treat Altice as a local ISP in New York, even though it provides
service in many areas of the state and has a public BAT on its
website. In our initial testing, we found that Altice‚Äôs BAT is very
limited‚Äîit appears to return coverage based solely on ZIP code
and only returns that an address is not covered for a minuscule
proportion (0.2%) of addresses that are covered according to Form
477 data. Altice‚Äôs BAT also does not specify when an address is
unrecognized and it returns coverage for nonexistent addresses
409
(seemingly based on ZIP code). Given these constraints, we have
no reliable means of applying our methods to Altice, so we treat
it as a local ISP (i.e., we assume in our analysis that Altice is 100%
available in the census blocks it reports as covered to the FCC).
C COVERAGE OF LOCAL ISPS PER STATE
Table 8 shows the proportion of the population in each state that is
covered by local ISPs.
D ISP-SPECIFIC BAT BEHAVIORS
We describe unusual ISP-specific BAT behaviors that we have en-
countered while conducting our study. We also describe how we
addressed each behavior in our data collection.
AT&T. The AT&T BAT is an API that involves technology-
specific queries‚Äîone query type for DSL and fiber, and another
query type for fixed wireless. We submit both query types for our
study, and we use the union of the two responses (i.e., if either
indicates coverage, we treat the address as covered).
CenturyLink. The CenturyLink BAT has a response type (ùê∂ùëí4)
where the underlying API returns coverage with very slow speeds
(‚â§ 1Mbps). When this occurs, the website‚Äôs user interface shows
that the address is not covered. Since users would only see the
address does not have service available, we treat the response type
as not covered.
The CenturyLink response type ùê∂ùëí0 appears to indicate an ad-
dress is not covered, but we infer from carefully analyzing the
response that it actually means the BAT does not recognize the
address. We base our assessment on the following factors: the re-
sponse occurs for test nonexistent addresses, the response appears
to only occur when the BAT cannot autocomplete the address and
the BAT‚Äôs internal address ID is set to null, and the JavaScript that
triggers the response includes the status string ‚ÄúWe were unable to
find the address you provided.‚Äù
Charter. We are not able to reliably discern when the Charter
BAT does not recognize an address. We found in testing that, when
queried with nonexistent addresses, the Charter BAT responds with
a generic request to call customer service. We are not able to locate
additional information in the BAT response indicating why the
prospective customer should call customer service. As a result, we
follow our presumption of labeling response types based on what
appears to the user, and we treat these responses as unknown.
As discussed in Section 3.5, a limitation in our Charter BAT
client requires us to categorize certain responses as unknown, even
though the website might have shown a different coverage outcome
to the user when querying for the address. The client that we
built for the Charter BAT queries an API endpoint and parses key
coverage fields in the response. We found in subsequent testing that
when the fields that our BAT client parsed were absent, the BAT
could still present coverage or non-coverage to the user. Because
our client did not retrieve the full Charter BAT webpage and did
not store response information beyond parsing the main coverage
fields, we are limited to treating all responses missing the fields as
unknown.
Consolidated. The visual presentation of Consolidated‚Äôs BAT
changed during our data collection. We found instances where
the BAT‚Äôs underlying API would return that an address was not

Table 7: Data collection for the ISPs and states in our study. An empty cell is a state-ISP combination where the ISP does not
provide service according to FCC data. A cell marked ‚Ä¢ is a state-ISP combination where the ISP provides service and our BAT
client collected data. A cell with numbers indicates a state-ISP combination where we treat the ISP as a local ISP, because it
provides comparatively less coverage. The count is the estimated state population in our study that the ISP covers according
to FCC data, and the percentage is that count divided by the state population in our study that has broadband access according
to FCC data. In the case of CenturyLink in New York, we manually confirmed that CenturyLink provides residential service
to a single census block in New York (according to Form 477 data) that has a population of 1 (according to FCC estimates).

covered, but the webpage presented to the user would show either
coverage for an unspecified ‚Äúarea‚Äù or a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù error. Because
the underlying API did not change since our reverse engineering,
and we did not otherwise see evidence that the responses from the
API had changed in meaning, we maintained our interpretation of
the API responses.
Cox. When querying Cox‚Äôs BAT for an apartment it will, in some
instances, respond with ‚Äòtoo many suggestions‚Äù rather than a list of
suggested units. In this scenario, our BAT client iteratively issues
requests with common apartment prefixes (e.g., ‚ÄúAPT,‚Äù ‚Äú1,‚Äù and
‚ÄúA‚Äù) to prompt the BAT to respond with suggestions. On the rare
occasion when that approach was not successful, the BAT client
noted the error, and we excluded the address from our analysis.
The Cox BAT does not clearly distinguish between addresses
that are unrecognized and addresses that are not covered. When we
query the BAT with either a nonexistent address or an address that
is clearly outside of Cox‚Äôs coverage area, the BAT returns that same
response indicating that the address is not covered. We distinguish
between addresses that are not recognized and those that are not
covered by using SmartMove, a tool that the Cox BAT displays
when an address may not be covered. SmartMove is the product of
a marketing collaboration among broadband providers, and the tool
enables prospective subscribers to check coverage across partici-
pating providers. Our BAT client queries SmartMove and evaluates
whether the address is recognized. If SmartMove recognizes the

error message likely is the result of the addresses not being covered.
We consequently treat this error message as an address not covered
outcome.
E FINAL TAXONOMY OF BAT RESPONSES
Table 9 presents our final taxonomy for mapping BAT response
types to coverage outcomes. The table includes every BAT response
type we identified across the nine ISP BATs we studied, along with
the corresponding coverage outcome and an explanation.
F BAT COVERAGE OUTCOMES BY ISP
Table 10 provides aggregate data about the coverage outcomes
that result from our BAT client and response taxonomy during
large-scale data collection.
G RESPONSE TYPES FROM CENTURYLINK
Fig. 8 displays eight example response types from CenturyLink‚Äôs
BAT. We provide these images as an example of the range and
variety of response types returned by each ISP‚Äôs BAT, and to provide
context into how we categorized these responses into an overall
taxonomy.
H OVERSTATEMENTS BY SPEED TIER
Fig. 7 plots coverage overstatements at varying speed thresholds
according to the four ISP BATs for which we collect speed data
(AT&T, CenturyLink, Consolidated, and Windstream). The results
are aggregated across ISPs and states.
These results reinforce that overstatements disproportionately
occur at lower speeds and lend weight to our hypothesis that net-
work technology is a significant factor in overstatements. At speeds
below 25 Mbps, 99% of ISP coverage is provided through DSL ac-
cording to Form 477 data, in comparison to 21% at speeds greater
than or equal to 25 Mbps (with fiber and cable being the main
alternatives).
I SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF
OVERSTATEMENTS
We replicate the analysis in Section 4.3 while varying assumptions
in three different ways, to understand how sensitive our results are
to the assumptions we make.
Unrecognized Addresses. We repeat our analysis with a slightly
less conservative method for counting addresses where at least one
ISP‚Äôs BAT returns that the address is unrecognized. In the main
text analysis, we set aside these addresses. Here, we treat these ad-
dresses as not covered if BATs return a mix of address not covered
and address not recognized responses.
The criteria for labeling an address as covered according to our
BAT data are the same as in Section 4.3. The criteria for labeling
an address as covered according to the FCC‚Äôs data, if the address is
not already labeled as covered according to our BAT data, expand
as follows:
‚Ä¢ There is at least one major ISP that does not cover the address
‚Ä¢ For every other major ISP that provides service to the ad-
dress‚Äôs census block according to Form 477 data, the ISP‚Äôs
according to its BAT.

and states for 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 Mbps lower bounds on
coverage speeds reported in Form 477 data.
address, we treat it as not covered by Cox; if SmartMove does not
recognize the address, we treat it as an unrecognized address for
Cox. While the SmartMove tool is a step removed from Cox, it is
the only available data source we have identified for distinguishing
addresses that Cox does not cover from addresses the BAT does not
recognize.
Frontier. The Frontier BAT, like the Charter BAT, does not pro-
vide a way to identify unrecognized addresses. We found in testing
that when we supplied nonexistent addresses, the BAT responded
with a generic error message and no indication of why the error
occurred. As with Charter, we follow our presumption of labeling
based on what appears to the user, and we treat these responses as
unknown.
Verizon. The Verizon BAT, like the AT&T BAT, is an API that
involves technology-specific queries‚Äîone query type for fiber and
another for DSL. As with AT&T, we submit both query types and
take the union of the results.
We found that, on rare occasions, Verizon‚Äôs BAT returned dif-
ferent results for the same query address. We accounted for this
issue by querying Verizon‚Äôs BAT for each address twice, and if the
results differed we treated the response as an unknown type.
The Verizon BAT‚Äôs web user interface does not visually dis-
tinguish between addresses that are not covered and addresses
that are not recognized‚Äîit appears that the address is not covered
in either scenario. We are able to distinguish the two coverage
outcomes by examining API responses. When an address is not
recognized, the API does not suggest an address and corresponding
ID (used to retrieve coverage information), and the response field
addressNotFound is set to true.
Windstream. During our data collection, Windstream‚Äôs BAT
began returning a specific error message (ùë§5) for addresses that
were previously returned as not covered. We could not find a case
of an address previously returned as covered that also returns this
error message. We called Windstream to check coverage for four
addresses returning this error message, and the representative con-
firmed both that the addresses are not covered and that the BAT
