### No WAN’s Land: Mapping U.S. Broadband Coverage with Millions of Address Queries to ISPs

#### A. Major ISPs as Local ISPs in Certain States
While major ISPs collectively cover over 90% of the population in the states we studied (according to FCC data), not every major ISP provides service to every state. Additionally, in 8 out of the 9 states, at least one major ISP covers only a small fraction of the state's total population. Querying Broadband Availability Tools (BATs) at scale is resource- and time-intensive. Therefore, for each ISP, we prioritize querying addresses in states where the ISP has the greatest coverage. In states where a major ISP has lesser coverage, we do not collect BAT coverage data for that ISP. We exclude such state-ISP combinations from our evaluation of per-ISP coverage overstatements (Section 4.1) and treat the ISP as a local ISP in that state for our estimate of per-state coverage overstatements (Section 4.3). This approach is consistent throughout our analysis in Section 4 and Appendix I.

**Table 7: Data Collection for ISPs and States**
- **State-ISP Combinations:**
  - An empty cell indicates a state-ISP combination where the ISP does not provide service according to FCC data.
  - A cell marked with "•" indicates a state-ISP combination where the ISP provides service and our BAT client collected data.
  - A cell with numbers indicates a state-ISP combination where we treat the ISP as a local ISP due to its limited coverage. The count represents the estimated state population covered by the ISP according to FCC data, and the percentage is that count divided by the state population with broadband access according to FCC data.

**Coverage Estimation:**
- For states where an ISP is treated as a local ISP, we estimate the population covered by identifying census blocks covered in Form 477 data, filtering out blocks not in the National Address Database (NAD), and summing the remaining blocks' populations. We also show the ISP's coverage as a proportion of the population with any broadband access, using per-state FCC covered population estimates in Table 12.

**Evaluation:**
- The gap in BAT data collection is small compared to state covered populations, likely having minimal impact on our estimates of per-state broadband availability overstatements. In 13 of the 15 state-ISP pairs without BAT data, the gap represents less than 2.6% of the state population with broadband access, and no gap exceeds 8% of the covered population.
- The gap in BAT data collection also has minimal impact on our estimates of per-ISP coverage overstatement ratios. For each ISP, the population without BAT responses is small compared to the population with BAT responses (roughly the population covered by the ISP according to FCC data in Table 3, but slightly larger due to omitted census blocks). State-ISP combinations lacking BAT data are entirely omitted from our per-ISP coverage analysis, resulting in a smaller and less diverse sample of addresses for measuring BAT responses.

#### B. Altice as a Local ISP
We treat Altice as a local ISP in New York, despite its extensive service in many areas and the presence of a public BAT on its website. Our initial testing revealed that Altice’s BAT is very limited, returning coverage based solely on ZIP code and indicating non-coverage for a minuscule proportion (0.2%) of addresses covered according to Form 477 data. The BAT also fails to specify when an address is unrecognized and returns coverage for nonexistent addresses based on ZIP code. Given these constraints, we have no reliable means of applying our methods to Altice, so we treat it as a local ISP, assuming 100% availability in the census blocks it reports as covered to the FCC.

#### C. Coverage of Local ISPs per State
**Table 8: Proportion of Population Covered by Local ISPs**
- **State:**
  - The table shows the percentage of the population in each state covered by local ISPs at any level of service (≥ 0 Mbps) and at benchmark broadband speed (≥ 25 Mbps).

#### D. ISP-Specific BAT Behaviors
We describe unusual ISP-specific BAT behaviors encountered during our study and how we addressed them:

- **AT&T:**
  - The AT&T BAT is an API with technology-specific queries for DSL and fiber, and another for fixed wireless. We submit both query types and use the union of the two responses.
- **CenturyLink:**
  - Response type \( \text{Ce4} \) indicates very slow speeds (≤ 1Mbps), which we treat as not covered.
  - Response type \( \text{Ce0} \) appears to indicate an address is not covered, but we infer it means the BAT does not recognize the address.
- **Charter:**
  - We cannot reliably discern when the Charter BAT does not recognize an address. When queried with nonexistent addresses, it responds with a generic request to call customer service, which we treat as unknown.
  - A limitation in our Charter BAT client requires us to categorize certain responses as unknown, even though the website might show different coverage outcomes.
- **Consolidated:**
  - The visual presentation of Consolidated’s BAT changed during data collection. Despite this, we maintained our interpretation of the API responses.
- **Cox:**
  - For apartments, the Cox BAT sometimes responds with "too many suggestions." Our BAT client iteratively issues requests with common apartment prefixes to prompt suggestions.
  - The Cox BAT does not distinguish between unrecognized and uncovered addresses. We use SmartMove, a tool displayed by the Cox BAT, to check coverage across participating providers.
- **Frontier:**
  - The Frontier BAT, like the Charter BAT, does not provide a way to identify unrecognized addresses. We treat responses as unknown.
- **Verizon:**
  - The Verizon BAT, like the AT&T BAT, involves technology-specific queries for fiber and DSL. We submit both query types and take the union of the results.
  - On rare occasions, the BAT returns different results for the same query. We account for this by querying twice and treating differing results as unknown.
- **Windstream:**
  - During data collection, Windstream’s BAT began returning a specific error message (\( w5 \)) for previously uncovered addresses. We confirmed with Windstream that these addresses are not covered.

#### E. Final Taxonomy of BAT Responses
**Table 9: Taxonomy for Mapping BAT Response Types to Coverage Outcomes**
- The table includes every BAT response type identified across the nine ISP BATs, along with the corresponding coverage outcome and explanation.

#### F. BAT Coverage Outcomes by ISP
**Table 10: Aggregate Data on Coverage Outcomes**
- The table provides data on the coverage outcomes resulting from our BAT client and response taxonomy during large-scale data collection.

#### G. Response Types from CenturyLink
**Figure 8: Example Response Types from CenturyLink’s BAT**
- The figure displays eight example response types from CenturyLink’s BAT, providing context into how we categorized these responses.

#### H. Overstatements by Speed Tier
**Figure 7: Average Coverage Overstatements by Speed Thresholds**
- The figure plots coverage overstatements at varying speed thresholds for four ISP BATs (AT&T, CenturyLink, Consolidated, and Windstream), aggregated across ISPs and states.
- The results reinforce that overstatements disproportionately occur at lower speeds, supporting our hypothesis that network technology is a significant factor in overstatements.

#### I. Sensitivity Analysis of Overstatements
We replicate the analysis in Section 4.3 while varying assumptions in three ways to understand the sensitivity of our results:

- **Unrecognized Addresses:**
  - We repeat our analysis with a slightly less conservative method for counting addresses where at least one ISP’s BAT returns that the address is unrecognized. We treat these addresses as not covered if BATs return a mix of "address not covered" and "address not recognized" responses.
  - The criteria for labeling an address as covered according to our BAT data remain the same. The criteria for labeling an address as covered according to the FCC’s data, if not already labeled as covered by our BAT data, expand to include:
    - At least one major ISP that does not cover the address.
    - For every other major ISP that provides service to the address’s census block according to Form 477 data, the ISP’s BAT indicates the address is covered.

This comprehensive and structured approach ensures clarity, coherence, and professionalism in the presentation of the research findings.
