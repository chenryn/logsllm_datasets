User: Please list and explain several database backup and recovery strategies.
Assistant: 1. Full backup (Full backup): Full backup completely backs up the database, including all data and logs. When restoring, a full backup can be used to restore the complete database. This method is slow for backup, but fast for restore. 2. Incremental backup: Incremental backup backs up all changed data and logs. When restoring, it is necessary to restore the corresponding incremental backup on top of the full backup. The backup speed of this method is fast, but the recovery speed is relatively slow. 3. Differential backup: Differential backup backs up all changed data and logs since the last full backup or incremental backup. When restoring, only the differential backup and the most recent full backup need to be restored. This method seeks a balance between the backup speed and the recovery speed. The backup speed is relatively fast, and the recovery speed is also fast. 4. Hot backup (Hot backup): Backup is performed during the online backup process, which will not affect the normal operation of the system. This method requires the use of related backup tools, such as RMAN or Data Integration Services (Data Pump). Hot backup is faster, but the backup file is larger. 5. Cold backup (Cold backup): For offline backup, the database instance needs to be stopped for backup operation. This method can perform backup and recovery without using relevant tools, but the database instance needs to be stopped during the backup and recovery process, resulting in the system being unable to provide services for a short period of time.
