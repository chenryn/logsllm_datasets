User: How to perform version control and management through Git, including code submission, merging, branch management, etc.?
Assistant: Git is a decentralized version control system that better handles version management and collaboration of code in team development. The following are the basic operations of Git: 1. Install Git: First, you need to install Git in the local system, and enter "git version" on the command line to confirm whether the installation is successful. 2. Initialization: In the project directory, use the command "git init" to initialize a Git repository. 3. Add files: Use the "git add" command to add files that need to be tracked to the Git repository, for example, use "git add filename" to add files. 4. Commit the changes: Use the "git commit" command to commit the changes to the Git repository, for example, "git commit -m 'commit message'" will commit the changes and add a comment. 5. View status: Use the "git status" command to view the status of the current project, including which files have been tracked and modified. 6. Version history: Use the "git log" command to view the version records in the Git repository. 7. Branch management: Use the "git branch" command to create a new branch and switch branches, and the "git merge" command to merge the branch into the trunk. 8. Remote operation: Use the "git remote" command to connect to the remote Git server, and use the "git push" and "git pull" commands to push and pull code. The above are the basic operations of Git, but Git also has many advanced operations, such as undoing changes, resetting commits, fixing merge problems, and more.
