The address in AT&T’s response does not match the input address.
AT&T returns the following error message: “Sorry we could not process your request
at this time. Please try again later.” (We retry this case multiple times).
AT&T returns that it found a close match to the input address, but the returned address
does not exactly match the input.
Rare case where the BAT returns no information, which appears to be the result of a
bug in the underlying API.
Rare case where the BAT requests a unit selection for the address, but the only option
is ‘No - Unit’, which upon selection, returns the same error.
AT&T returns the following error message: “That wasn’t supposed to happen!”
CenturyLink can service the address.
CenturyLink cannot service the address.
The backend API in this case returns that CenturyLink can service the address, but with
very low speeds (≤1Mbps). The browser interface displays that CenturyLink cannot
service the address. We interpret this case as CenturyLink cannot service the address.

Table 10: Aggregate coverage outcomes that result from our large-scale data collection and BAT response taxonomy. We present
coverage outcomes by ISP and U.S. Census Bureau designation of whether census blocks are urban or rural.
BAT returns that it either does not cover or does not recog-
nize the address.
We then complete the analysis as in the main text. Table 11
presents the results.
Under the above set of assumptions, we find that the FCC may
overstate access to benchmark broadband for 0.87% of the popu-
lation in census blocks we study. If we naively extrapolate this
result to the national population, we estimate that 2.6 million Amer-
icans have overstated access to broadband. For comparison, in the
main text we provide an estimate of 2.5 million Americans with
overstated access.
Unrecognized Addresses and Unknown Responses. We re-
peat our analysis with an aggressive method for treating addresses
as not covered. In the main text, we only label an address as not
covered if all major ISP BATs return that the address is not covered.
Here, we treat an address as not covered if BATs return any mix of
not covered, address unrecognized, or an unknown response.
We do not filter out any census blocks for this analysis. We do,
however, discard Charter responses that are unknown and have
a potential parsing error; we would otherwise count addresses as
not covered by Charter owing to a limitation of our BAT client (see
Section 3.5 and Appendix D).
The criteria for labeling an address as covered according to our
BAT data are the same as in Section 4.3. The criteria for labeling
an address as covered according to the FCC’s data, if the address is
not already labeled as covered according to our BAT data, expand
as follows:
