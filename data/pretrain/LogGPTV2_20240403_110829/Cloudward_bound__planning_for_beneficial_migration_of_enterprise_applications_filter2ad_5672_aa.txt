## Abstract
This paper addresses the challenges of migrating enterprise services to hybrid cloud-based deployments, where operations are partially hosted on-premise and partially in the cloud. Hybrid architectures allow enterprises to leverage cloud benefits while adhering to performance, privacy, and regulatory requirements. Our contributions include:
1. Highlighting the complexity of modern enterprise applications, including their multi-tiered nature, numerous components, and interdependencies.
2. Developing a model to evaluate the benefits of a hybrid migration approach, considering enterprise-specific constraints, cost savings, and potential transaction delays and communication costs.
3. Providing insights into security policies and presenting algorithms to ensure secure reconfiguration during migration.

## 1. Introduction
Cloud computing offers significant cost savings through economies of scale and flexible resource allocation. Many early adopters have successfully leveraged the cloud to deliver new services. However, migrating existing enterprise applications to the cloud presents substantial challenges, including performance, delay, and regulatory compliance.

A recent survey by Symantec [25] indicates that over 36% of data center managers face issues with the number of applications and data center complexity. Over 82% aim to reduce data center costs, and 72% are considering or using public cloud computing, though most are still in the planning or trial stages.

Hybrid architectures, where applications are partly hosted on-premise and partly in the cloud, offer a balanced solution. This paper addresses two key challenges in hybrid migrations:
1. **Component Placement:** Deciding which components to keep local and which to migrate, considering application complexity, cost, and performance.
2. **ACL Migration:** Ensuring security policies are maintained during migration, including automated approaches for policy reconfiguration.

## 2. Motivation
### 2.1 Characteristics of Enterprise Applications
Enterprise applications support various business functions, such as payroll, customer relationship management, and supply chain management. These applications are typically multi-tiered, with front-end, business-logic, and back-end tiers. Each tier may have multiple functional components, and each component may have multiple servers with load balancers.

Figure 1 shows the number of distinct functional components for five enterprise applications, ranging from 11 to over 100 components. The complexity is further illustrated by the intricate request flows between components.

### 2.2 Security Policies in Enterprise Data Centers
Sensitive enterprise applications, such as employee payroll, have strict access controls. Security policies are implemented using Virtual LANs (VLANs) and firewalls, with Access Control Lists (ACLs) defining permitted and denied traffic. A large university campus data center has over 40 firewall contexts, each with multiple ACLs containing tens to hundreds of rules.

### 2.3 Issues in Migrating Enterprise Applications
Migrating entire applications to the cloud can lead to higher response times and increased wide-area communication costs. Hybrid deployments, where only some components are migrated, can mitigate these issues. We focus on hybrid architectures and present a model to determine optimal component placement.

## 3. Problem Formulation
### 3.1 Abstraction and Problem Formulation
Consider an enterprise running \( K \) applications, \( A_i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq K \), and \( m \) components, \( C_i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \). Each application involves a subset of components. We represent the application structure using a graph \( G = (V, E) \), where \( V = \{C_i\}_{i=1}^m \cup \{I, O\} \) and \( I \) and \( O \) represent internal and external users, respectively. Nodes \( i \) and \( j \) are connected by an edge if they communicate. The number of transactions per second and the average size of transactions along \( (i, j) \) are denoted by \( T_{i,j} \) and \( S_{i,j} \).

In deciding how to migrate a component, we consider its nature. Web front-ends and business-logic tiers can be partially migrated, while back-end databases are typically migrated atomically. Each component \( C_i \) consists of \( N_i \) servers, and the goal is to determine the number of servers \( n_i \) (where \( n_i \leq N_i \)) to be migrated to the cloud. Database components are modeled with \( N_d = 1 \) and integral \( n_d \).

Let \( P \) denote a set of policy constraints governing the migration process. The goal is to determine a migration strategy \( M = \{n_i\} \) that maximizes benefits while adhering to constraints.

## 4. Model and Evaluation
Our model evaluates the benefits of hybrid migration, considering enterprise-specific constraints, cost savings, and potential performance impacts. We use real enterprise applications and Azure-based cloud deployments to validate our approach. Results show that hybrid migrations can be optimal, and careful planning is crucial.

## 5. Security Policy Reconfiguration
We present automated approaches to reconfigure network devices and ensure security policies are maintained during migration. Our methods involve extracting end-to-end policies, transforming them for address space changes, and placing the transformed policies in the migrated setting. Evaluations using realistic scenarios and router configurations demonstrate the feasibility and importance of our approach.

## 6. Discussion and Future Work
While our results are promising, there are other challenges and open issues in migrating enterprise networks to the cloud. We discuss these in Section 7.

## 7. Conclusion
This paper provides a framework for planning beneficial hybrid cloud migrations for enterprise applications, addressing component placement and security policy reconfiguration. Future work will explore additional challenges and refine our models and algorithms.
