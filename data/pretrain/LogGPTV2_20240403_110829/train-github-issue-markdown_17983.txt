##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.6.6
##### Environment:
Host OS: OSX 10.9.4  
Target OS: Oracle Linux Server release 6.5
##### Summary:
Installing a package with the yum module and option 'enablerepo' with 2 repo's
fails with the message:
    failed: [localhost] => {"failed": true}
    msg: Error setting/accessing repo puppetlabs-deps: Error getting repository data for puppetlabs-deps, repository not found
##### Steps To Reproduce:
After adding a new repo file to the /etc/yum.repos.d directory with all repo's
in there disabled, this snippet is used to install the package:
    - name: Install puppet-server package
      yum:
        name=puppet-server
        enablerepo=puppetlabs-products,puppetlabs-deps
##### Expected Results:
The package is installed
##### Actual Results:
The error described above is shown.  
This works fine on CentOS 6.5
The yum module splits the enablerepo values and generates multiple
`--enablerepo` tags. This works fine on CentOS 6.5 but not on Oracle Linux
6.5. For Oracle Linux only one `--enablerepo` must be specified where multiple
repo's must be separated with a comma.
