### Issue Type:
Bug Report

### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.6.6

### Environment:
- Host OS: macOS 10.9.4
- Target OS: Oracle Linux Server release 6.5

### Summary:
When attempting to install a package using the `yum` module with the `enablerepo` option specifying two repositories, the installation fails with the following error message:
```
failed: [localhost] => {"failed": true}
msg: Error setting/accessing repo puppetlabs-deps: Error getting repository data for puppetlabs-deps, repository not found
```

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a new repository file to the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory with all repositories disabled.
2. Use the following Ansible playbook snippet to install the package:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install puppet-server package
     yum:
       name: puppet-server
       enablerepo: puppetlabs-products,puppetlabs-deps
   ```

### Expected Results:
The `puppet-server` package should be installed successfully.

### Actual Results:
The installation fails with the error message described above. This issue does not occur on CentOS 6.5, where the `yum` module correctly splits the `enablerepo` values and generates multiple `--enablerepo` tags. However, on Oracle Linux 6.5, only one `--enablerepo` tag is allowed, and multiple repositories must be separated by a comma within that single tag.
