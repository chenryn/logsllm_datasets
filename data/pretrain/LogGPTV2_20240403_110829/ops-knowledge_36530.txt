User: I have a server A where some logs are saved, and another server B with a web server (IIS) on it. 
I can access serverA from Windows Explorer with zero problems, but when I want to access it from serverB with some PHP code, it doesn't work.
I made a python script that accesses the file from serverA on serverB. It works if I run that script from CMD, but when I run that script from PHP code it doesn't work anymore.
I run IIS server as a domain account that has access on serverA
I try to run that as LocalService, NetworkService, System, LocalUser but no success. 
That script is a simple open command, so problem it's not from python.
Assistant: Resolved.
Uninstall IIS and use XAMPP.
No problem found till now, everything works okay.
So use XAMPP/WAMP!
