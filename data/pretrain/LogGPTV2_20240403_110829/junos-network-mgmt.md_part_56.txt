}
The following example shows how to use the IP address of a device as the SNMP agent engine ID:
user@host# show snmp
engine-id {
use-default-ip-address;
}
The following example shows the use of a selected value, AA in this case, as the SNMP agent engine ID
of a device:
user@host# show snmp
engine-id {
local AA;
}
How can I configure a device with dual Routing Engines or a chassis cluster (SRX Series Services
Gateways) for continued communication during a switchover?
When configuring for continued communication, the SNMP configuration should be identical between
the Routing Engines. However, it is best to have separate Routing Engine IDs configured for each
Routing Engine, especially when using SNMPv3.
The following example shows the configuration of the Routing Engines in a dual Routing Engine device.
Notice that the Routing Engine IDs are set to the MAC addresses for each Routing Engine:
user@host# show groups
re0 {
system {
host-name PE3-re0;
}
interfaces {
fxp0 {
unit 0 {
family inet {
address 116.197.178.14/27;
address 116.197.178.29/27 {
master-only;
}
668
}
}
}
}
snmp {
engine-id {
use-mac-address;
}
}
}
re1 {
system {
host-name PE3-re1;
}
interfaces {
fxp0 {
unit 0 {
family inet {
address 116.197.178.11/27;
address 116.197.178.29/27 {
master-only;
}
}
}
}
}
snmp {
engine-id {
use-mac-address;
}
}
}
The following is an example of an SNMPv3 configuration on a dual Routing Engine device:
user@host> show snmp name host1
v3 {
vacm {
security-to-group {
security-model usm {
security-name test123 {
group test1;
669
}
security-name juniper {
group test1;
}
}
}
access {
group test1 {
default-context-prefix {
security-model any {
security-level authentication {
read-view all;
}
}
}
context-prefix MGMT_10 {
security-model any {
security-level authentication {
read-view all;
}
}
}
}
}
}
target-address server1 {

}
notify server {

670
}
notify-filter filter1 {

}
view all {

}
community comm1 {

}
community comm2;
community comm3;
community comm3 {

authorization read-only;
logical-system LDP-VPLS {
routing-instance vpls-server1;
}
}
trap-group server1 {
targets {
116.197.179.22;
}
}
routing-instance-access;
traceoptions {
flag all;
}
}
How can I track SNMP activities?
SNMP trace operations track activity of SNMP agents and record the information in log files.
A sample traceoptions configuration might look like this:
[edit snmp]
user@host# set traceoptions flag all
When the traceoptions flag all statement is included at the [edit snmp] hierarchy level, the following log
files are created:
• snmpd
671
• mib2d
• rmopd
SNMPv3 FAQs
This section presents frequently asked questions and answers related to SNMPv3.
Why is SNMPv3 important?
SNMP v3 provides enhanced security compared to the other versions of SNMP. It provides
authentication and encryption of data. Enhanced security is important for managing devices at remote
sites from the management stations.
In my system, the MIB object snmpEngineBoots is not in sync between two Routing Engines in a dual
Routing Engine device. Is this normal behavior?
Yes, this is the expected behavior. Each Routing Engine runs its own SNMP process (snmpd), allowing
each Routing Engine to maintain its own engine boots. However, if both routing engines have the same
engine ID and the routing engine with lesser snmpEngineBoots value is selected as the primary routing
engine during the switchover process, the snmpEngineBoots value of the primary routing engine is
synchronized with the snmpEngineBoots value of the other routing engine.
Do I need the SNMP manager engine object identifier (OID) for informs?
Yes, the engine OID of the SNMP manager is required for authentication, and informs do not work
without it.
I see the configuration of informs under the [edit snmp v3] hierarchy. Does this mean I cannot use
informs with SNMPv2c?
Informs can be used with SNMPv2c. The following example shows the basic configuration for SNMPv3
informs on a device (note that the authentication and privacy is set to none):
[edit snmp]
v3 {
usm {
remote-engine 00000063000100a2c0a845b3 {
user RU2_v3_sha_none {
authentication-none;
privacy-none;
}
}
672
}
vacm {
security-to-group {
security-model usm {
security-name RU2_v3_sha_none {
group g1_usm_auth;
}
}
}
access {
group g1_usm_auth {
default-context-prefix {
security-model usm {
security-level authentication {
read-view all;
write-view all;
notify-view all;
}
}
}
}
}
}
target-address TA2_v3_sha_none {
address 192.168.69.179;
tag-list tl1;
address-mask 255.255.252.0;
target-parameters TP2_v3_sha_none;
}
target-parameters TP2_v3_sha_none {
parameters {
message-processing-model v3;
security-model usm;
security-level none;
security-name RU2_v3_sha_none;
}
notify-filter nf1;
}
notify N1_all_tl1_informs {
type inform; # Replace “inform” with “trap” to convert informs to traps.
tag tl1;
}
notify-filter nf1 {
673
oid .1 include;
}
view all {
oid .1 include;
}
}
You can convert the SNMPv3 informs to traps by setting the value of the type statement at the [edit snmp
v3 notify N1_all_tl1_informs] hierarchy level to trap as shown in the following example:
user@host# set snmp v3 notify N1_all_tl1_informs type trap
SNMP Interaction with Juniper Networks Devices FAQs
This section presents frequently asked questions and answers related to how SNMP interacts with
Juniper Networks devices.
How frequently should a device be polled? What is a good polling rate?
It is difficult to give an absolute number for the rate of SNMP polls per second since the rate depends on
the following two factors:
• The number of variable bindings in a protocol data unit (PDU)
• The response time for an interface from the Packet Forwarding Engine
In a normal scenario where no delay is being introduced by the Packet Forwarding Engine and there is
one variable per PDU (a Get request), the response time is 130+ responses per second. However, with
multiple variables in an SNMP request PDU (30 to 40 for GetBulk requests), the number of responses
per second is much less. Because the Packet Forwarding Engine load can vary for each system, there is
greater variation in how frequently a device should be polled.
Frequent polling of a large number of counters, especially statistics, can impact the device. We
recommend the following optimization on the SNMP managers:
• Use the row-by-row polling method, not the column-by-column method.
• Reduce the number of variable bindings per PDU.
• Increase timeout values in polling and discovery intervals.
• Reduce the incoming packet rate at the SNMP process (snmpd).
674
For better SNMP response on the device, the Junos OS does the following:
• Filters out duplicate SNMP requests.
• Excludes interfaces that are slow in response from SNMP queries.
One way to determine a rate limit is to note an increase in the Currently Active count from the show snmp
statistics extensive command.
The following is a sample output of the show snmp statistics extensive command:
user@host> show snmp statistics extensive

Does SNMP open dynamic UDP ports? Why?
The SNMP process opens two additional ports (sockets): one for IPv4 and one for IPv6. This enables the
SNMP process to send traps.
I am unable to perform a MIB walk on the ifIndex. Why is this?
Any variable bindings or values with an access level of not-accessible cannot be queried directly because
they are part of other variable bindings in the SNMP MIB table. The ifIndex has an access level of not-
accessible. Therefore, it cannot be accessed directly because it is part of the variable bindings. However,
the ifIndex can be accessed indirectly through the variable bindings.
I see SNMP_IPC_READ_ERROR messages when the SNMP process restarts on my system and also
during Routing Engine switchover. Is this acceptable?
Yes, it is acceptable to see SNMP_IPC_READ_ERROR messages when the SNMP process is restarted, the system
reboots, or during a Routing Engine switchover. If all the processes come up successfully and the SNMP
operations are working properly, then these messages can be ignored.
What is the source IP address used in the response PDUs for SNMP requests? Can this be configured?
The source IP address used in the response PDUs for SNMP requests is the IP address of the outgoing
interface to reach the destination. The source IP address cannot be configured for responses. It can only
be configured for traps.
SNMP Traps and Informs FAQs
This section presents frequently asked questions and answers related to SNMP traps and informs.
Does the Junos OS impose any rate limiting on SNMP trap generation?
The Junos OS implements a trap-queuing mechanism to limit the number of traps that are generated
and sent.
If a trap delivery fails, the trap is added back to the queue, and the delivery attempt counter and the
next delivery attempt timer for the queue are reset. Subsequent attempts occur at progressive intervals
of 1, 2, 4, and 8 minutes. The maximum delay between the attempts is 8 minutes, and the maximum
number of attempts is 10. After 10 unsuccessful attempts, the destination queue and all traps in the
queue are deleted.
676
Junos OS also has a throttle threshold mechanism to control the number of traps sent (default 500 traps)
during a particular throttle interval (default 5 seconds). This helps ensure consistency in trap traffic,
especially when a large number of traps are generated due to interface status changes.
The throttle interval begins when the first trap arrives at the throttle. All traps within the throttle
threshold value are processed, and traps exceeding the threshold value are queued. The maximum size
of all trap queues (the throttle queue and the destination queue) is 40,000 traps. The maximum size of
any one queue is 20,000 traps. When a trap is added to the throttle queue, or if the throttle queue has
exceeded the maximum size, the trap is moved to the top of the destination queue. Further attempts to
send the trap from the destination queue are stopped for a 30-second period, after which the
destination queue restarts sending the traps.
NOTE: For the Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switch, the maximum size of all trap queues
(the throttle queue and the destination queue) is 1,000 traps. The maximum size for any one
queue on the EX Series is 500 traps.
I did not see a trap when I had a syslog entry with a critical severity. Is this normal? Can it be changed?
Not every syslog entry with critical severity is a trap. However, you can convert any syslog entry to a
trap using the event-options statement.
The following example shows how to configure a jnxSyslogTrap whenever an rpd_ldp_nbrdown syslog entry
message error occurs.
user@host> show event-options
policy snmptrap {
events rpd_ldp_nbrdown;
then {
raise-trap;
}
}
Are SNMP traps compliant with the Alarm Reporting Function (X.733) on the Junos OS?
No, SNMP traps on the Junos OS are not X.733 compliant.
Can I set up filters for traps or informs?
Traps and informs can be filtered based on the trap category and the object identifier. You can specify
categories of traps to receive per host by using the categories statement at the [edit snmp trap-group trap-
group] hierarchy level. Use this option when you want to monitor only specific modules of the Junos OS.
677
The following example shows a sample configuration for receiving only link, vrrp-events, services, and otn-
alarms traps:
[edit snmp]
trap-group jnpr {
categories {
link;
vrrp-events;
