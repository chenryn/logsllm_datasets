In my application, I update figures every several seconds. I am not sure why,
but WebAgg backend tends to draw text wrong. For example:
![webagg_text](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/97dcb8bc0587aaa54af2ea37c413be9dfa002b891f11c2702917abc96c9c97cf/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f323739333535312f323231373331352f38376231303333652d396131612d313165332d396137342d3964373664616431343337662e706e67)
The bottom-left matrix should contain the same labels as the upper-right.
Sometimes, even the upper-right matrix is displayed without text, but after
some time it recovers. Sometimes, the text for the bottom-left matrix is drawn
on the upper-right matrix, causing unreadable overlapped labels.
I wonder, where I should start digging for that difference between drawing
boxes and color (always valid) and text (randomly skipped on some figures)?
