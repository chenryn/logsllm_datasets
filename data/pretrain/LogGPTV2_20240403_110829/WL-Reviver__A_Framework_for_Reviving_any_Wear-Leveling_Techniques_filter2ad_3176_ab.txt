# WL-Reviver: A Framework for Reviving Wear-Leveling Schemes on PCM-Based Memory

## Abstract
WL-Reviver is a framework designed to revive any wear-leveling scheme on Phase-Change Memory (PCM)-based memory in the face of failures. This work addresses the limited endurance and early failure issues of PCM, ensuring that wear-leveling schemes can continue to function effectively even when some blocks fail.

## 1. Introduction
Phase-Change Memory (PCM) is a promising non-volatile memory technology, but it suffers from limited endurance and early failures. To address these issues, various fault tolerance and wear-leveling schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes often cease to function with the first block failure. WL-Reviver provides an efficient solution to this problem by dynamically managing failed blocks without requiring significant changes to existing systems.

### 2.1 Fault Tolerance Schemes
To extend the lifetime of PCM, many fault tolerance schemes have been developed. These schemes aim to either correct errors or prevent early failures.

#### 2.1.1 Error Correction
PCM is more prone to permanent stuck-at faults rather than transient errors. Schemes like ECP [20], SAFER [21], and RDIS [15] use additional metadata to correct a certain number of errors in a bit group before declaring it as failed. ECP, for example, encodes the locations of failed cells into a vector and assigns other cells to replace them. WL-Reviver is designed to manage failures that these schemes cannot tolerate.

#### 2.1.2 Preventing Early Failures
Early failures in PCM can occur due to process variation and non-uniformly distributed writes. Solutions to prevent early failures can be categorized into three groups:

1. **Dynamic Allocation of Hardware Resources**: Schemes like Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) [18] reserve metadata space for error correction, allowing early-failed blocks to stay alive longer.
2. **Page Recovery Schemes**: FREE-p [23] and Zombie [8] use reserved data space to hide failed blocks via pointers. These schemes can be disrupted by wear leveling operations, and WL-Reviver provides a solution to this issue.
3. **Wear Leveling Techniques**: Wear leveling techniques, such as Start-Gap [21] and Security Refresh [22], are used to distribute writes evenly across memory blocks. However, they require a contiguous address space and cease to function with the first block failure. WL-Reviver addresses this issue with an efficient address remapping technique.

### 2.2 Comparison with LLS
LLS [12] is a scheme that shares a similar goal with WL-Reviver. However, LLS has several limitations:
1. **OS Support**: LLS requires OS support to acquire reserved space, which can lead to expensive data relocation operations.
2. **Mapping Overhead**: LLS uses a bitmap to maintain the mapping relationship between failed and backup blocks, increasing access time.
3. **Address Space Management**: LLS uses fixed-size chunks, which can reduce software-usable space unnecessarily and compromise wear leveling.
4. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating existing wear-leveling schemes into LLS requires substantial adaptation.

In contrast, WL-Reviver requires minimal OS support, no additional data migration, and minimal data access overhead. It conducts implicit, incremental, and flexible space reservation without modifying existing wear-leveling schemes.

## 3. The Design of WL-Reviver
WL-Reviver is a framework that revives wear-leveling schemes by hiding block failures and redirecting accesses to healthy blocks. It assumes only one fundamental operation common to all wear-leveling schemes: migrating data into a memory block.

### 3.1 Acquiring Spare Space to Hide Failed Blocks
#### 3.1.1 Conditions and Timing
WL-Reviver acquires spare space incrementally to minimize the reduction of software-usable memory space. It does not modify the interface between the software and memory hardware, relying on the standard exception handling mechanism to detect and handle errors.

#### 3.1.2 Acquisition Method
WL-Reviver sets up two registers to manage the acquisition of Physical Addresses (PAs). One register records the current PA available as a virtual shadow block, and the other records the last PA available. PAs in the range between the current and last PA represent the reserved virtual spare space. When a failed block is detected, the PA recorded in the first register is used as a virtual shadow block, and the register increments its value. If the PA in the first register exceeds that in the second register and an access error occurs, the error is reported to the OS, and the registers are updated.

#### 3.1.3 Handling Data Migration Failures
For data migration failures, WL-Reviver uses unlinked virtual shadow blocks to hide failures transparently. If no unlinked PAs are available, WL-Reviver can either interrupt the OS immediately or delay the space acquisition. The latter option, chosen by WL-Reviver, avoids changing the OS but risks losing data. To mitigate this, WL-Reviver ensures that data is written successfully by using immediately available shadow blocks.

### 3.2 Linking Failed Blocks to Shadow Blocks
Figure 2 illustrates how failed blocks, virtual shadow blocks, and shadow blocks are linked. WL-Reviver uses a mapping function to link failed blocks to their shadow blocks via virtual shadow blocks. When a shadow block fails, a new virtual shadow block is created, and the mapping function is updated. This process ensures that the chain size is minimized, reducing the overhead of accessing shadow blocks.

## 4. Conclusion
WL-Reviver is an efficient and non-intrusive framework for reviving wear-leveling schemes on PCM-based memory. By dynamically managing failed blocks and minimizing the need for OS support, WL-Reviver ensures that wear-leveling schemes can continue to function effectively, extending the lifetime of PCM-based memory systems.
