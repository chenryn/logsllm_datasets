We now can use kv-storage in chrome with:
    import storageArea from 'std:kv-storage';
How about support similar API for deno_std?
It may looks like this, and imports the std module with the same version as
the deno you installed.
    import { serve } from 'deno_std:http/server';
And it's good to keep the same version between deno and deno_std modules.
