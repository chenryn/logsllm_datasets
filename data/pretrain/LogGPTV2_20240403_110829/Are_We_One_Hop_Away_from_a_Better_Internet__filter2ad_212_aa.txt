## Abstract
The Internet faces well-known issues with performance, reliability, and security. However, proposed improvements have seen limited adoption due to the challenges of deploying them on a global scale. We propose that focusing on the paths between popular content providers and their clients, which carry a significant portion of Internet traffic, may offer a more feasible approach to addressing these problems. Our measurements show that Google, for example, connects directly to networks hosting over 60% of end-user prefixes, and other large content providers exhibit similar connectivity. These direct paths present an opportunity to implement solutions that bypass the difficulties of wide-scale deployment, potentially improving performance and security.

## 1. Introduction
Internet routing is plagued by a range of issues, including slow convergence, long outages, circuitous routes, and vulnerabilities to IP spoofing and prefix hijacking. The research and operational communities have proposed various solutions, but these have seen limited adoption. A key challenge is the need for widespread implementation across millions of devices and tens of thousands of networks, making such solutions difficult to deploy. Additionally, the goal often is to find a general solution applicable to any Internet path, which can be challenging to design.

We argue that instead of solving problems for arbitrary paths, we should focus on the high-traffic paths that carry the majority of Internet traffic. Trends such as the rise of Internet video, the move to shared cloud infrastructure, and the concentration of mobile and broadband services mean that a small number of paths carry a disproportionate amount of traffic. This skewed distribution suggests that targeted improvements on these critical paths could have a substantial impact.

This paper focuses on one characteristic of these high-traffic routes: they are often very short. Our measurements show that while the average Internet path traverses 1-2 intermediate transit ASes, most paths from a large content provider like Google go directly from Googleâ€™s network to the client's network. This observation opens the possibility of developing tailored solutions that leverage these short paths to improve performance and security.

### Key Contributions
- **Measurement Scope:** Our study quantifies the full extent of "flattening" for a major content provider, covering paths to 3.8M /24 prefixes, compared to previous studies that measured only a small subset.
- **Short Paths Analysis:** We show that popular paths serving high-volume client networks tend to be shorter than paths to other networks, and some content providers even host servers in other networks, further shortening paths.
- **Contextual Insights:** We provide context by showing that ASes not peering with Google often have a local geographic footprint and low query volumes. Our measurements for other providers suggest that Microsoft has similar short peering paths, while Amazon relies more on Tier 1 and other providers.

### Potential Benefits of Short Paths
- **Simplified Coordination:** Direct peering relationships may simplify the coordination required for route reliability.
- **Natural Incentives:** Direct paths can leverage the natural incentives of content providers and clients to ensure route quality.
- **Tailored Solutions:** Focusing on a few key players can lead to more effective and beneficial solutions.

## 2. Datasets and Data Processing
Our goal is to assess the AS path lengths between popular content providers and consumers. We use a combination of traceroutes and a dataset of query volumes to estimate the importance of different paths.

### Datasets
- **PlanetLab Traceroutes:** A day of iPlane traceroutes from April 2015, representing the view of routing available from an academic testbed.
- **End-User Query Volumes:** Aggregated and anonymized queries to a large CDN, providing normalized aggregate query counts per /24 client prefix in one hour in 2013.
- **Traceroutes from Cloud Providers:** Traceroutes from Google Compute Engine (GCE), Amazon EC2, and IBM SoftLayer to all 3.8M prefixes in our CDN trace and all 154K iPlane destinations.
- **RIPE Atlas Traceroutes:** Traceroutes from RIPE Atlas probes in approximately 1600 ASes around the world to our cloud VMs and popular websites.

### Data Processing
- **IP to AS Conversion:** We convert IP-level traceroutes to AS-level paths using widely-used practices, removing unresponsive hops, private IP addresses, and IXP-associated IPs.
- **Path Cleaning:** We remove unknown AS segments and merge adjacent ASes under shared administration.
- **Path Filtering:** We exclude paths that do not reach the destination AS, leaving us with paths to 3M of the 3.8M /24 prefixes.

## 3. Internet Path Lengths
The length of Internet paths varies depending on the measurement method. We show that most flows from popular web services to clients traverse at most one inter-AS link, whereas traditional datasets result in longer paths.

### 3.1 Measuring Paths from the Cloud
- **Baseline Comparison:** Using PlanetLab traceroutes to iPlane destinations as a baseline, we find that 61% of the prefixes have one-hop paths from GCE, compared to 41% of the iPlane destinations.
- **Traffic Distribution:** When weighted by query volume, over 66% of the queries come from prefixes with a one-hop path.
- **Path Variability:** Some ASes have paths of different lengths to reach different prefixes within the same destination AS, possibly due to traffic engineering or split ASes.

## Conclusion
We conclude by asking whether it might be possible to take advantage of short paths, particularly those where the content provider peers directly with the client network, to make progress on long-standing routing problems. We hope this paper will encourage the community to explore the potential of short paths to improve Internet routing.
