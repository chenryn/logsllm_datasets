alarms.
NOTE: ACX Series routers do not support ITU-T Y.1731 ETH-AIS for layer 2 services (bridging).
The following are the limitations for server MEP
• Triggering of ETH-AIS messages over services (Layer 2 circuit and Layer 2 VPN) by the link-loss
server MEP is done on a best-effort manner. This is because the transmission of ETH-AIS messages is
independent of the service status and there is no guarantee for delivering the ETH-AIS messages
before service goes down.
• Pseudowire protection with CFM-MEP session is not monitored by the server-MEP because an
entity to monitor pseudowire protection already exists for the service (Layer 2 circuit and Layer 2
VPN).

MX Series routers support ITU-T Y.1731 Ethernet alarm indication signal (ETH-AIS) function to provide
fault management for service providers. ETH-AIS enables the service provider to suppress alarms when
a fault condition is detected.
The following points are to be noted when ETH-AIS is configured in a maintenance domain:
• Transmitting or receiving of AIS on a MEP does not override the lowest-priority-defect statement
configured at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id] hierarchy level. Therefore, alarms are reported according to
the defect priority configured.
• Alarms are reported even when the higher domain levels exchange CCMs at a faster rate than the
lower domain levels.
• Maintenance association intermediate point (MIP) is transparent to ETH-AIS frames—that is, the
MIPs do not perform any action in response to ETH-AIS frames.
• When the service provider requests the MEP to generate an AIS for a lower level or for the same
level, the request is rejected.
• AIS generation is stopped when the MEP clears the remote MEP within the maintenance association.
• When the auto-discovery statement is enabled for a MEP, the remote MEP information is cleared after
the configured hold interval expires.
The following tasks explain how to enable ETH-AIS in a maintenance domain, configure an action to be
taken when a defect is detected, and to attach the action profile to a CFM MEP:

Configuring Alarm Indication Signal on ACX Series Routers
ACX Series routers support ITU-T Y.1731 Ethernet Alarm Indication Signal function (ETH-AIS) to provide
fault management for service providers. ETH-AIS enables you to suppress alarms when a fault condition
is detected.
To support ETH-AIS transmission, the following configuration information is required by a CFM MEP:
• Client Maintenance Entity Group level—Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) level at which the
immediate client layer Maintenance Domain Intermediate Points (MIPs) and Maintenance Association
End Points (MEPs) exist.
• ETH-AIS transmission period—Determines the ETH-AIS PDU transmission interval.
• Priority—Determines the priority of packets with ETH-AIS information. This is optional.
To configure ETH-AIS in CFM MEP, you need to:
• Configure an action profile with ETH-AIS action
• Attach the action profile to the CFM MEP
To configure an action profile with ETH-AIS action, include the following statements at the [edit
protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management] hierarchy level:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
action-profile action-profile-name {
event {
adjacency-loss;
all-defects;
cross-connect-ccm;
errored-ccm;
receive-ais;
}
action {
log-and-generate-ais {
level [1-7];
interval 1s | 1m ;
priority [0-7];
}
log-ais;
}
}
354
To attach an action profile to a CFM MEP, include the following statements at the [edit protocols oam
ethernet connectivity-fault-management] hierarchy level:
maintenance-domain maintenenace-domain-name {
level level-number;
maintenance-association maintenance-domain-name {
continuity-check {
interval 1s;
loss-threshold 3;
}
mep mep-id {
interface interface-name;
direction up | down;
priority priority-value;
action-profile action-profile-name;
}
}
}
NOTE: You cannot configure a maintenance domain level that is lower than or equal to the level
that it is associated with.
To support ETH-AIS transmission, the following configuration information required by a server MEP:
• Server MEP definition—Defines the association of server MEP identifier to the server layer.
• For Layer 2 circuit and Layer 2 VPN, the logical interface connected to a customer network (UNI)
would be the identifier for the server layer that needs to be monitored by the server MEP.
• For physical link loss detection, the physical interface under Ethernet protocol would be the
identifier for the server layer that needs to be monitored by the server MEP.
• Association of server MEP defect—Defines the association of server MEP defects to ETH-AIS action.
• Association action profile and server MEP—Defines the binding of server MEP and action profile.
To configure ETH-AIS in server MEP, you need to:
• Create an action profile with ETH-AIS action for server MEP defects.
• Attach the action profile to a server MEP
355
To create an action profile, include the following statements at the [edit protocols oam ethernet
connectivity-fault-management] hierarchy level:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
action-profile action-profile-name {
event {
server-mep-defects {
link-loss-defect;
l2circuit-defect;
l2vpn-defect;
}
}
action {
log-and-generate-ais {
level 1…n;
interval 1 second | 1 minute;
priority dot1p [range 0-7];
}
}
}
To attach an action profile to a server MEP, include the following statement at the [edit protocols oam
ethernet connectivity-fault-management] hierarchy level:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
server-mep mep-identifier {
protocol l2circuit | l2vpn | ethernet {
interface interface-name;
}

Use this topic to understand what inline transmission is and how to enable it for maximum scaling for
CFM, LFM, and performance monitoring functions.
Enabling Inline Transmission of Continuity Check Messages for Maximum Scaling
Scaling is the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of work and to continue to function well.
Scaling can refer to increasing capacity and the ability to handle increasing workload, number of
subscribers or sessions, hardware components, and so on. Continuity check protocol is used for fault
detection within a maintenance association. The maintenance association end points (MEPs) send
continuity check messages (CCMs) periodically. The time between the transmissions of CCMs is known
as the interval. The receiving MEP maintains a database of all MEPs in the maintenance association.
By default, CCMs are transmitted by the CPU of a line card, such as a Modular Port Concentrator (MPC).
If the duration between transmissions of CCMs is low or if the CCMs for a specific line card scale, then
we recommend that you delegate transmission of CCMs to the forwarding ASIC (that is, to the
hardware) by enabling inline transmission of CCMs. Inline transmission of CCMs is also known as inline
keepalives or Inline-KA. Inline transmission enables the system to handle more connectivity fault
management (CFM) sessions per line card. By enabling inline transmission of CCMs, you can achieve
maximum scaling of CCMs.
To enable inline transmission of CCMs, perform the following steps:
1. In configuration mode, go to the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-
monitoring] hierarchy level.
[edit]
user@host# edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring
357
2. Delegate transmission of CCMs to hardware by enabling hardware-assisted keepalives.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring]
user@host# set hardware-assisted-keepalives enable
NOTE: Inline transmission of CCMs is not enabled when there is a CFM session already
established. To enable inline transmission, you must first deactivate the CFM session using
the deactivate command and then reactivate the CFM session using the activate command.
To disable inline transmission, use the hardware-assisted-keepalives disable statement. After disabling inline
transmission, you must reboot the router for the changes to take effect.

Enabling Inline Transmission of Link Fault Management Keepalives for Maximum
Scaling
Scaling is the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of work and to continue to function well.
Scaling can refer to increasing capacity and the ability to handle increasing workload, number of
subscribers or sessions, hardware components, and so on.
By default, LFM keepalive packets are transmitted by the periodic packet management ppm process on
the line-card. You can delegate transmission of LFM keepalive packets to the forwarding ASIC (that is, to
the hardware) by enabling inline transmission. Inline transmission of LFM keepalives is also known as
inline keepalives or Inline-KA. By enabling inline transmission of LFM keepalive packets, you can achieve
maximum scaling of keepalive packets, reduction of the load on the ppm process, and support LFM in-
service software upgrade (ISSU) for non-juniper peers (for a keepalive interval of 1 second).
NOTE: Do not enable or disable inline transmission of LFM when an LFM session is already
established. To enable or disable inline transmission, you must first deactivate the existing
established LFM session using the deactivate command, and then reactivate the LFM session
using the activate command after enabling or disabling inline LFM.
Before you enable inline transmission of LFM keepalive packets, complete the following tasks:
358
• Verify if any LFM session is online and active. To verify if any existing or established LFM session is
online and active, issue the following command:
