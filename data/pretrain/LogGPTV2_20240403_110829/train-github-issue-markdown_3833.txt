Hey!
I think I found a bug, although I'm not sure if it might be intended behavior.
If it is actually a bug, I'll try find the fix and flesh out a proper minimum
reproducible example.
Here's an annotated plot that I generated during my day-to-day usage:

This is a fairly standard `g = sns.catplot(..., kind="boxen", ...)`, but have
a look at the colouring for the fourth boxen in red on the two axes. On the
left, the "very light red" has a width of about half the main box, but on the
right the "very light red" has a width of only a quarter the main box, and the
"light red" has a width of half the main box.
I feel like the red boxens should look something more like:

So that if two boxes in a boxen plot have the same color and represent the
same quantile range, they also have the same width.
Once again, it's debatable if this is a bug or not, but I thought I'd raise it
and offer to help out if it was actually overlooked.
