User: I'm trying to use mido with Python 3.5.1. I have successfully installed it (it says "successfully installed mido-1.1.14" in command prompt) but when I tried to import it in python, it gives me the message 

ImportError: No module named 'mido' 

I understand that mido targets Python 2.7 and 3.2, but does it really not work with 3.5 at all? Or am I missing something here?
I'm using Windows 8.1, 64-bit; but my Python 3.5 is 32-bit version. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!
Assistant: Installing a module for one python version does not install it for the others.
If you're using pip, run something like pip3 install mido.  pip defaults to installing for Python 2, so you'll need to explicitly call pip3.
