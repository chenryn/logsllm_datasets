Before, a very nice white with shadows button was generated when using the
"btn" class without any other class like "btn-primary" for example.
Now, in BS3, it is gone.
Please put it back.
Same goes with all input-x sizes, badge colors and many many more. I think the
purpose of a new BS3 version should be adding new features and not deleting
them.
