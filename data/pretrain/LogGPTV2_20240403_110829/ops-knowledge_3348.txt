User: I was forced to alias my app name after migrating to the High Replication Datastore.
I use the google.appengine.api.app_identity.get_application_id() method throughout my app, but now it returns the new app id instead of the original one even when visiting via the old app id url.
Is there a way to output the original app id?
thanks
Assistant: No - get_application_id returns the ID of the app that is actually serving your request. You can examine the hostname to see if the request was directed to oldappid.appspot.com.
