User: You need to perform bulk deployment operations to a remote server. Please provide a bulk deploy script available for quick operation.
Assistant: Below is an example of a simple batch deployment script. It assumes that you already have an ssh key pair, and you will use this key pair to connect to all servers. ``` #!/bin/bash # List of servers, separated by spaces servers="server1 server2 server3" # Remote command cmd="sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" # Traverse servers and execute remote commands for server in $servers; do echo "Deploying to $server..." ssh $server "$cmd" echo "Finished deploying to $server." done ``` This script will automatically traverse each server in the server list and connect to them, and then execute the specified remote command (in this case, updating and upgrading the server's packages) on each server. To use this script, save it to a file called `deploy.sh` and run it with: ``` chmod +x deploy.sh ./deploy.sh ``` Note that this is a Extremely simple scripts that can be customized and modified to fit your specific workflow.
