Summary:  
Auto-reload on the development server is triggered by requests (i.e. file
reads) without a file modification happening.
How to reproduce:  
Any Flask project, having installed Watchdog version >= 2.3.0. Send a request
to any endpoint.
Expected behavior:  
When sending a request to the server, the server answers and doesn't get
reloaded unless a file is modified.
My assumption is that the new event FileOpenedEvent added in 2.3.0 is being
treated as a file modification and triggering auto-reload. Forcing watchdog
version 2.2.1 fixed the problem.
Environment:
  * Python version: 3.8
  * Flask version: 2.2.2
