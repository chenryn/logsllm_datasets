Appendix
Adaptability to blocking: Assesses the system’s resilience to unexpected
blocking events and new kinds of blocking.
Application support: Assesses the system’s usefulness for a wide variety of
applications (e.g. web browsing, chat, email).
Availability of documentation: Assesses the quality of user and developer
documentation.
Availability of infrastructure: This criterion considers the availability of the
infrastructure used by an approach for users and the feasibility of deployment.
Byte overhead: How many extra bytes are introduced by the tool.
CPU usage by users: Assesses the percentage of CPU cycles consumed by
the client or server part of the system.
Clean uninstall: Assesses whether the client software leaves traces after being
uninstalled.
Client performance: Assesses an approach’s client program eﬃciency in
terms of CPU and memory usage.
Concurrent connection count: They measured the number of simultaneous
connections to a server.
Connection length: Measures the duration of ﬂows (e.g., TCP connections)
and evaluates whether the duration can be a distinguisher. (If a connection is
suspiciously long, for example.)
Cost of external services: Estimates the cost of external services, e.g., cloud
services, CDNs, that are required to deploy an approach.
Decentralization of trust: Evaluates the degree to which trust is centralized;
i.e., all trust is placed in a single server/company, or spread out among many
parties.
Deniability under computer inspection: Whether the circumvention tool
users can plausibly deny using it even when their computers are inspected.
Developed by experts: Assesses whether the developers of the tool are known
security experts.
Diversity of users: Assesses the diversity of types of users of the system.
Does not store user information: Does not log user information.
End-user protection: Assesses whether an approach protects user’s privacy
from intermediate and end nodes.
Fraction of clients that can utilize the network: Assesses the number of
clients (source hosts) in the Internet that would be able to join a system.
Free/low cost: Cost in USD to use the system.
Geographic diversity of proxies: Examines the diversity of proxies in terms
of geographic location.
Goodput: The amount of useful throughput the tool enables.
Has a GUI: Assesses whether the client software has a graphical user
interface.
Hide user information from end host: The tool hides information about the
user from the end host (destination) to which the user connects to provide
some degree of anonymity.
