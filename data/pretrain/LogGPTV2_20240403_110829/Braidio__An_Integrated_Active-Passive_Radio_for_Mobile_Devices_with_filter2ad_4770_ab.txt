mode. This means higher power consumption at the trans-
mitter end, which is an inconvenience but not a show-stopper.
In other words, Braidio has a safety net when backscatter
sensitivity becomes a problem, and can easily fallback to
the more reliable, but perhaps less desirable, active mode.
This difference has huge consequences since it means that
we have room to explore more unconventional designs that
focus primarily on reducing power consumption while sac-
riﬁcing some sensitivity in the process.
This leads us to our key idea, which is to leverage a sim-
ple envelope detector based receiver and use it as a building
block for passive self-interference cancellation. The enve-
lope detector is an extremely simple receiver circuit and is
also commonly used on backscatter tags to receive data from
a reader. This detector can be turned into a passive receiver
that is capable of self-interference rejection if we combine
it with a high-pass ﬁlter. If the self-interference channel is
stationary, then self-interference presents as a DC offset at
the output, which would not affect backscatter signal recep-
tion. Even if the self-interference channel is dynamic, its
coherence time is typically in the order of milliseconds [26],
which means that it creates low frequency components less
that 1kHz. These low frequency components can be easily
removed by high pass ﬁltering.
This observation opens the door for an end-to-end inte-
grated version of Braidio that is no more complex than a
typical active radio combined with a small amount of extra
circuitry that is effectively similar to the components needed
to design a passive tag! With just this combination of parts,
we may be able to design a minimalist, low-complexity, and
low-power radio that is capable of operating in both active
and passive modes.
Our design has substantial implications in practice. First,
it means that the bill-of-materials cost can be kept low since
we only add a tag’s worth of components to an active ra-
dio like BLE. This is important for radios that are intended
for low-cost devices such as mobile phones and wearables
(e.g. the Nordic nRF51822 and TI CC2540 cost $2.5 in vol-
ume). Second, lower complexity also means less real-estate
needed on the device, which is another major consideration
on small form-factor portable devices. Third, by integrating
the active and passive components into a single radio with

shared modules, we can switch between the modes easier
since components need to be turned off and on fewer times.
While this high-level idea guides our design, many issues
need to be dealt with to make it practical. We now discuss
these issues.
3.2 Low-power Backscatter Reader RX
Let us consider the core idea in a bit more detail. The so-
lution we discussed is to use a passive receiver at the reader
side based on a RF charge pump [33]. This receiver relies
on several stages of a diode-capacitor conﬁguration that can
boost the voltage of a weak signal received at the RF fron-
t end. At the same time, the conﬁguration blocks the large
but relatively constant carrier self-interference signal from
passing through.
The circuit and working mechanism is shown in Figure 3.
The charge pump circuit extracts the envelope of the dynam-
ic RF signal and converts it into DC voltage. Given a sine
wave signal with amplitude of 1V, it can generate 2V DC
voltage at the output as shown in Figure 3(b).
This design has two beneﬁts in terms of performance. The
main advantage of a passive receiver is the ultra low power
consumption. The receiver is entirely passive and is excited
by incident RF signal so it requires no external power sup-
ply and consumes near-zero power draw. This reduces the
overall power consumption of the backscatter subsystem to
levels that are acceptable on mobile platforms. From a per-
formance standpoint, a passive receiver also tackles the self-
interference problem because it convert self-interference to
DC directly, and can be separated out from useful signal
in frequency domain. This makes it possible to extract out
the weak backscatter signal despite there being a large self-
interference signal from the carrier transmitter.

However, there are several additional concerns that need
to be addressed for a passive receiver to be practical. From a
sensitivity perspective, the main issue is that the backscatter
signal is quite weak, and the output from the charge pump
may be insufﬁcient for robust decoding. This means that
we may need additional active circuits beyond the passive
receiver to ensure reception of weak backscattered signals.
From a robustness perspective, the issue is that an envelope-
based detector is incoherent i.e. it is not sensitive to carrier
phase unlike the coherent detectors on RFID readers. This
means that we have to deal with phase cancellation issues
wherein the amplitude of the signal extracted by the non-
coherent detector can remain unchanged even though the
backscatter transmitter is actually changing its transistor s-
tate. Finally from a channel selectivity perspective, the issue
is that a passive envelope detector is not selective in terms of
which channel it tunes into, and just looks at the energy in a
wide bandwidth.
We now look at how we can tackle these three issues.
Improving sensitivity via instrumental ampliﬁer:
The
output of the Dickson RF charge pump has very low volt-
age, so it can lead to low receiver sensitivity. Typically, the
signal amplitude has to be at least several mV [14, 20] for
the comparator to generate the correct output, resulting in a
sensitivity of around -40dBm. In principle, a charge pump
can boost the signal by 2N times where N is the number of
stages of charge pump. But this is far from enough to bridge
the gap to commercial, active receiver ICs, which is in the
order or -80dBm. To solve this problem, we added an in-
strumental ampliﬁer between the output of charge pump and
the input of comparator. A charge pump boosts voltage but
it also increases the output impedance signiﬁcantly since it
is passive and the output power cannot be larger then input
power. Thus the circuit has to be tuned carefully and the am-
pliﬁer has to be high impedance and low input capacitance,
otherwise the signal will be greatly reduced.
Antenna diversity to address phase cancellation: Since
an envelope-based receiver is non-coherent and insensitive
to phase, it can suffer from the phase cancellation problem.
388
This refers to a particular situation where the signal from
the backscatter transmitter is orthogonal to the background
signal (including self-interference), as shown in Figure 4(a).
The signal amplitude at the envelop detector is A = ||−−→Vrx1|−
|−−→Vrx0||. Assuming that −−→Vtx0 = −−−→Vtx1 we could have A =
2cos(θ)|−−→Vtx0|. When θ is close to π
2 , the signal amplitude
will become very weak. If θ = π
2 , changes in the transistor
state at the backscatter transmitter will not change the sig-
nal amplitude at the receiver, and only changes the phase.
Since an envelope detector cannot detect phase, it will see
no change in the received waveform and will be unable to
decode the signal.
Figure 4(b) shows a visualization of signal strength when
we place a transmit antenna at X=0.95m, Y=0.5m and re-
ceive antenna at X=1.05m, Y=0.5m. The darker the color,
the weaker the received signal. We see that in addition to free
space path loss [40] which is proportional to the square of
distance, we can observe dark regions which are very close
the transmitter and receiver due to phase cancellation. Fig-
ure 4(c) shows the received signal strength along the line
shown in Figure 4(b). We can see that there are null points
with very low SNR quite close to the devices with Y=0.5m,
which would result in high bit error rate.
The technique that we use to combat this issue is anten-
na diversity. This is a widely used technique to tackle de-
structive multi-path interference [22, 27].
If signals from
all paths are destructive at one antenna, the hope is that a
second antenna will experience sufﬁciently different channel
conditions to provide a better SNR. A graphical illustration
is shown in ﬁgure 5. Assuming that we have two received
antennas with different distance to the transmit antenna, we
can expect to have two different background signal vectors
– −−−→Vbgch1 and −−−→Vbgch2. Similarity, the received signal ampli-
tude of antenna 1 is determined by θ1 and the path loss, and
θ2 and path loss determine the received signal strength. If
cos(θ1) is close to zero, we try to decode signal from receive
antenna 2 assuming that cos(θ2) is large, so signal strength
from antenna 2 is stronger.

difference with and without antenna diversity. From the ﬁg-
ure we can observe that without antenna diversity, the SNR
can drop from about 30dB to around 0dB, causing errors in
detection. With antenna diversity, the SNR at null points are
still higher than 5dB, enabling correct detection.
Frequency selectivity: Another issue we need to address
is that a simple envelope detector is not frequency selective.
Out of band interference coming from a cellphone or WiFi
router can trigger the envelope detector circuit resulting in
poor reception. We solve this problem by putting a Sound
Acoustic Wave (SAW) ﬁlter at the radio front-end to ensure
that the envelope detector only receives signal within the in-
tended license-free band. SAW ﬁlters are passive compo-
nents which do not incur additional power consumption.
Summary: Commercial Reader v.s. Braidio
We conclude with a brief summary of the many differences
between our design and the design used in a commercial R-
FID reader, summarized in Table 3. At a high level, our
goal is to reduce power and complexity while not sacriﬁc-

ing much performance. Our key differences are that a) we
eliminate the use of a mixer and low-pass ﬁlter and instead
use a passive SAW ﬁlter, b) we eliminate the Low Noise
Ampliﬁer, the IF ﬁlter, and signal processing components
and instead use charge pump and ampliﬁer on the resulting
signal, and c) we eliminate the need for an IQ-based orthog-
onal receiver and instead simply use an antenna switching
scheme.
4. ENERGY-AWARE CARRIER OFFLOAD
At a high level, Braidio offers three modes of operation
(named after the receiver states). The ﬁrst is the active mode
where both transmitter and receiver have carrier, and corre-
sponds to the case when Braidio behaves like an active radio.
The power consumption in this mode is mostly symmetric,
with some wiggle room by changing transmit power level.
The second is the passive receiver mode where only trans-
mitter has carrier, and the receiver uses a passive envelope
detector to save power. This mode of operation is not one
we sought out to design, but is an interesting option that we
enable through our architecture. The power consumption in
this mode is asymmetric, with the transmitter consuming as
much as an active radio but the receiver operating like a pas-
sive radio and consuming minimal power. The third mode
is the backscatter mode where only receiver has a carrier,
which is equivalent to the backscatter scenario where the
reader does most of the work. This mode is the one that
allows the transmitter to ofﬂoad the carrier to the receiving
end-point in order to save energy. Here, the data receiver
consumes more power since it is transmitting the carrier and
also doing the work to cancel self-interference and decoding
the signal as discussed earlier. But the data transmitter is a
simple backscatter tag which is extremely power efﬁcient.
Our goal in this section is to design a layer above the
raw hardware that enables dynamic carrier ofﬂoad, i.e. that
switches between the three modes in proportion to the ener-
gy availability at the two end-points, as shown in Figure 7.
For example, consider the case where in mode (a), both end-
points generate the carrier and each consumes 50mW, and
in mode (b) one end-point generates the carrier and con-
sumes 120mW with the other end-point consuming 10µW.
Let the ratio of available energy on two devices d1 and d2 be
10:1. To operate in an energy-aware manner, these devices
can multiplex between the two radio modes and use mode
(a) 90.9% of the time and mode (b) 9.1% of the time such
that d1 consumes 109mW and d2 consumes 10.9mW.
