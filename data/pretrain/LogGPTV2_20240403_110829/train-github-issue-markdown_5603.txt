# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18362.356
    PowerToys version: 0.11.0
# Steps to reproduce
Install using MSI and try to launch PowerToys using any of the available
shortcuts.
# Expected behavior
Expecting PowerToys to open / load.
# Actual behavior
My monitors flicker briefly and Task Manager shows "PowerToys Runner" as
running, consuming around 6.5MB of RAM. No window opens however and there is
no icon in the Notification Area. All PowerToys shortcut icons are also blank,
not the one expected.
Using Windows 10 with 4 monitors - 3 are running from a GTX 970 and one is
running from on-board Intel GPU. Same problem after multiple re-installs /
reboots.
