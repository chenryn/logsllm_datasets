is that call-identifying information will be irrecoverably de-
stroyed. A more subtle danger arises from the use of the
CDC as a control channel for the CCC. The Collection Func-
tion (CF) at the LEA depends on CCOpen and CCClose mes-
sages on the CDC to control capture of call content. These
messages signal the respective start and stop of call content.
If these messages are lost, then both pen register and call
content data have been irrecoverably destroyed.
We use 64 kbps (the preferred CDC capacity) as a bench-
mark for the remainder of this section. While faster circuits
may be possible between the TSP and LEA, the bottleneck
may lie within the TSP network designed to this 64 kbps
bandwidth upper limit. We observe that at the time the
J-standard was originally developed, the diﬀerence between
the average and worst case bandwidths was likely very small,
particularly in the case of cellular telephony (the technology
of most interest to law enforcement [2]). Today, in contrast,
due to the rapid development of new services being shoe-
horned into CALEA and the J-standard, the worst case is
unpredictable and likely several orders of magnitude greater
than the average case.5
5In many regards, this is very similar to another recently
published telecommunications vulnerability, in which over
the air signaling channels (designed for the requirements of
voice calls) are overloaded for new data services [32]. These
new services turn out to be excellent vectors for denial-of-
service attacks, which disrupt not only the new service but
516By the nature of surveillance, most LAESP messages are
generated as a direct result of some action taken by the sub-
ject. This places the subject at an advantage by allowing
her to reliably and precisely generate traﬃc on the CDC. Al-
though LAESP uses a fairly eﬃcient binary encoding fram-
ing protocol on the CDC (BER and X.25 respectively), the
messages themselves contain a signiﬁcant amount of infor-
mation not present in the monitored channel to facilitate
de-multiplexing at the LEA. Each message must contain (at
a minimum) a timestamp, a case identiﬁer, and possibly the
identity of the IAP that intercepted the call-identifying in-
formation. Most messages also contain call and party iden-
tifying information. This often leads to a signiﬁcant ampliﬁ-
cation factor, where, for example, the one bit of information
necessary to encode whether a subject’s phone is on- or oﬀ-
hook requires nearly 100 bytes when expressed as a LAESP
message. LAESP also transmits both raw user signals (e.g.
“phone went on hook”) and higher-level TSP network events
(e.g. “call released”), causing further ampliﬁcation.
The remainder of this section presents a number of dif-
ferent methods that the wiretap subject may utilize to ex-
haust a ﬁxed capacity CDC. It should be kept in mind that
when multiple technologies are being simultaneously moni-
tored (e.g. wireless voice plus data), a successful attack on
the CDC using any of these technologies prevents wiretap-
ping of them all.
ISDN Feature Keys
ISDN allows users to directly
control supplementary features such as call forwarding, call
waiting, and call holding through the Q.931 [17] signaling
protocol. The protocol supports both a stimulus mode in
which the terminal (i.e., phone handset) operates in a very
simplistic stateless mode and a functional mode intended for
more sophisticated devices such as computers. In stimulus
mode, Q.931 messages are sent to the switch immediately
whenever a function button is pressed on the handset, with
no local interpretation or decision making. The J-standard
requires that such “subject signals” be reported over the
CDC as long as they are not made redundant by another
LAESP message; it does not require the IAP or Delivery
Function to interpret or validate the signal in any way.
The Q.931 feature key message is 6 bytes in length. In con-
trast, the generated SubjectSignal LAESP message conser-
vatively requires 82 bytes – an ampliﬁcation factor of nearly
14. To saturate a 64kbps CDC with SubjectSignal mes-
sages, the target must generate 64000/(8 · (82 + 3)) = 94.11
signaling messages per second (X.25 frames require 3 bytes
of overhead). The capacity of a standard Basic Rate Inter-
face (BRI) ISDN used by the target to signal the TSP is 16
kbps. Producing 6-byte signals at a rate of 94.11 per second
requires 4.52 kbps of bandwidth (Q.931 messages require
no additional framing), well within the capacity of the sub-
scriber’s signaling channel. The target can easily exhaust
the resources of the CDC, preventing the wiretap from re-
ceiving call records and (in the case of content wiretaps)
requests to open call content channels.
SMS Messaging
In addition to traditional voice calls,
the J-standard also covers messaging services such as the
Short Message Service (SMS) available on nearly all wireless
devices and plans. When a SMS message to or from a mon-
also the basic voice signaling for which the channels are pri-
marily used.
itored subject is sent, a PacketEnvelope LAESP message
is generated that speciﬁes the sender and receiver identities
and optionally the message contents. A conservative size
for a PacketEnvelope is 173 bytes for an SMS with no mes-
sage payload and 190 bytes for SMS messages with a 1 byte
payload. An attacker would therefore need to generate at
least 46 (pen register) or 42 (content) messages per second
to saturate a 64 kbps CDC.
Although the J-standard does not specify the locations of
IAPs within the TSP network, a logical position for captur-
ing SMS messages is at the Short Messaging Service Center
(SMSC) since all messages to or from the subject must pass
through it [7]; product literature from several SMSC manu-
facturers supports this assumption [30, 31], touting CALEA
support as a SMSC feature.
The SMSC is at a ﬁxed location within the core of the
wireless network, allowing messages to be accepted and queued
even when the recipient’s phone is oﬄine or in use. In addi-
tion to messages originating with other mobile devices, most
SMSCs also handle messages originating from external net-
works, permitting features such as mobile e-mail, travel or
ﬁnancial alerts, and search engine queries.
Previously, Traynor et al. [32] showed how these Internet-
facing external network connections can be exploited to cre-
ate DoS attacks on cellular networks. The same approach
could be used by an attacker to simultaneously send many
SMS messages to the target’s phone number from multiple
accounts and services. Since the publication of Traynor’s at-
tack [32], many TSPs have improved their defenses through
rate limiting and attack detection at the SMSC and at sub-
mission interfaces like web and e-mail, reducing the prac-
ticality both of their attack against the cellular network
and the SMS-based attack against CALEA wiretap systems.
However, as the popularity of SMS messaging increases,
TSPs will likely provision more resources to increase SMS
capacities (and consequently, increasing potential proﬁts).
Since the capacities of CDCs are ﬁxed, diminished SMS
rate limiting will permit better service while concurrently
increasing wiretaps’ vulnerability to SMS-based CDC ex-
haustion attacks.
VoIP Signaling As a product of the traditional circuit-
switched wireline and wireless telecommunications industry
associations, the J-standard does not speciﬁcally address
the requirements of other (competing) technologies such as
Voice-over-IP (VoIP). The J-standard has, however, in prac-
tice served as a guide from which other industry associations
have made minimal modiﬁcations to suit their diﬀering tech-
nical requirements [22, 15]. We focus our evaluation of VoIP
on the PacketCableTMSpeciﬁcation since it is the most re-
cent and most referenced standard of which we are familiar.
Since consumer VoIP messaging traverses broadband con-
nections, the target can dedicate a large fraction of his band-
width to producing VoIP signaling data. Unlike analog wire-
line services, VoIP signaling data may be generated at broad-
band speeds. Moreover, routing policies that prefer VoIP
data over non-VoIP IP traﬃc [6] further enhance the tar-
get’s ability to saturate the 64kbps CDC.
To determine achievable signaling rates, we used the SIPp
traﬃc generator tool [12] to rapidly place and immediately
release SIP calls using a consumer broadband connection.
We applied SIPp to two SIP destinations: the IPTel (a free
SIP provider) echo test service and the TellMe SIP service.
517Figure 2: Achieved SIP VoIP call rates using resi-
dential broadband connections.
Figure 3: Number of ﬂows per second, measured at
the receiver, using Sprint’s EVDO cdma2000 data
service.
Requiring no SIP-to-wireline gateways, calls to the echo test
server are analogous to calls directed towards an internal
TSP destination (e.g., voicemail). Calls to TellMe reﬂect
purely SIP-to-SIP communication. The achieved call rates,
measured as the number of successful completed calls per
second, is shown in Figure 2. To prevent our experiment
from attacking the two called services, we capped our call
rate at 100 calls per second (careful measures were taken to
ensure that both services could easily tolerate such rates).
According to the PacketCableTMSpeciﬁcation, a completed
subject-initiated VoIP call produces the following CDC mes-
sage sequence: Origination, CCCOpen(cid:91), Answer, CCChange(cid:91),
CCClose(cid:91), and Release, with messages marked with (cid:91) sent
only for content wiretaps. Thus, every completed call pro-
duces 3 or 6 CDC messages, depending upon whether call
content is delivered to the LEA. The corresponding message
sequences require 393 or 1293 bytes for pen register and
content wiretaps, respectively. A 64kbps CDC can there-
fore handle 20.36 calls/second for pen register taps and 6.19
calls/second for content wiretaps. Hence, the signaling rate
achievable using a consumer cable Internet connection is
more than suﬃcient to overwhelm the CDC.
The above attack highlights the inadequate provisioning
of VoIP CDCs. Other signaling attacks – for example, the
rapid production of hold, transfer, or call forwarding signals
– are likely also eﬀective at overﬂowing the CDC. In general,
allocating wiretap resources based on statistical call models
(which likely diﬀer little between VoIP and wireline services)
does not take into consideration the resources available to a
motivated adversary.
Adopted in 2006, the J-STD-025-B revision
IP Flows
of the J-standard added requirements for intercepting and
reporting packet data (for example, mobile Internet connec-
tions made using cdma2000 or GPRS/UTMS). Reporting of
connections over the CDC is performed at two diﬀerent gran-
ularities. PacketDataEstablishment and PacketDataTer-
mination messages are respectively generated each time the
subject attaches to and disconnects from the Internet. Each
network “ﬂow” is indicated using a PacketDataPacketFil-
ter message. For TCP, the start of a ﬂow is recorded when a
SYN packet is ﬁrst intercepted and continues until a FIN or
RST closes the connection. UDP ﬂows begin when the tu-
ple {source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port}
is ﬁrst seen, and expire after a timeout period has elapsed.
Several of the ﬁelds within a PacketDataPacketFilter mes-
sages contain objects whose exact encoding and size we were
unable to determine. At a minimum, however, a message
must be at least 160 bytes to contain the mandatory ﬁelds
and addresses. A subject who can open (or close) 40 ﬂows
per second will ﬁll a 64 kbps CDC, causing denial-of-service.
Sending 40 TCP SYN packets or empty UDP packets per
second requires 16kbps of upstream bandwidth from the tar-
get’s data connection, well within the advertised rates avail-
able on 3G and 2G+ data networks in the US. To evaluate
whether this holds true in practice, we used a Sierra Wireless
Compass 597 EV-DO Revision A cdma2000 modem provi-
sioned for Sprint’s wireless data service. This card connects
to a computer using a USB2 connection, and data sessions
are made by opening a PPP session over the device. We
measured the maximum rate at which we could establish
new UDP ﬂows to a server in our lab, which is shown in
Figure 3. The results show that for the ﬁrst four seconds
a steady rate of 100 connections per second was achievable,
after which traﬃc shaping within the Sprint network kicked
in and blocked new connections from being established to
our server for several seconds. However, 4 seconds is more
than suﬃcient to initiate a voice call in parallel, causing the
Origination and CCOpen messages to be lost. For complete
stealth, the CDC could be ﬂooded again when terminating
the voice call, leaving no record at the Collection Function.
3.2 Inbound Attacks
The previous section described attacks in which the wire-
tap target produces signaling information at a rate that ex-
ceeds the wiretap’s capacity. We now consider wiretap coun-
termeasures that may be carried out by parties other than
the wiretap target.
Kampmeier et al. [19] speculated that Call Content Chan-
nel (CCC) resources may be exhausted if the target uses call
forwarding (a service that redirects incoming calls to a des-
tination selected by the service subscriber). The J-standard
requires that a CCC be provisioned per call rather than per
service, and hence each forwarded call must be allocated its
own CCC. Since CCCs are a limited resource, a suﬃcient
number of incoming forwarded calls will consume all CCC
channels, causing subsequent calls to or from the target to
be unmonitored.
We demonstrated the practicality of this attack by con-

a large call center. In the most generous scenario listed in
the annex of the J-standard, LEAs may provision a T1 line
to carry CCCs from the TSP. A T1 has 23 bearer chan-
nels for carrying voice or data traﬃc, one of which is used
by the CDC, leaving 22 channels for CCCs.
(The num-
ber of available CCCs may be even lower if the T1 line is
shared between multiple wiretaps.) In our experiment, 29
callers using various cellular carriers were asked to simulta-
neously call the target’s mobile phone number. When the
target used AT&T’s mobile service, 20 of the 29 calls were
successfully forwarded. We repeated the experiment using
T-Mobile as the target’s service. Here, all 29 callers were
forwarded to the call center, exceeding the capacity of the
T1 link that carries CCCs between the TSP and the LEA.
An analogous (but perhaps less practical attack) is possi-
ble against the CDC. Each incoming forwarded call produces
TerminationAttempt, CCOpen(cid:91), Redirection, CCClose(cid:91), and
Release LAESP messages ((cid:91) indicates messages generated
only for content wiretaps), consuming 482 or 736 bytes of
CDC bandwidth for pen register and content wiretaps, re-
spectively. Since the CDC is transmitted over a single 64kbps
bearer line, the CDC may be exhausted if the rate of incom-
ing calls exceeds 16.60 (for pen register) or 10.87 (for call
content wiretaps) calls per second.
