# VLAN Layer 2 Attacks and Mitigation Strategies

## Introduction
This document outlines various Layer 2 attacks on VLANs, their implications, and recommended mitigation strategies.

## VLAN Layer 2 Attacks

### Sending RAW Configuration BPDU
- **Attack Description**: An attacker sends raw configuration Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to disrupt the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Disable spanning tree functions on all user interfaces but maintain them for network-to-network interfaces.
  - Enable root guard on Cisco equipment or BPDU guard on user ports to prevent unauthorized devices from becoming root bridges.
  - Example:
    ```shell
    #spanning-tree portfast dbduguard
    #interface fa0/10
    #spanning-tree guard root
    ```

### Sending RAW TCN BPDU
- **Attack Description**: An attacker sends raw Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDUs to cause a DoS scenario.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Follow the same steps as for sending raw configuration BPDUs.

### Claiming Root Role
- **Attack Description**: An attacker claims the root role in the STP topology, causing disruptions.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Enable root guard on critical ports to prevent unauthorized devices from becoming root bridges.

### Claiming Other Role
- **Attack Description**: An attacker claims other roles in the STP topology, leading to potential network instability.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use BPDU guard and root guard to protect against such attacks.

### Claiming Root Role Dual-Home (MITM)
- **Attack Description**: An attacker creates a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by claiming the root role in a dual-homed environment.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Ensure that spanning tree functions are properly configured and use root guard to prevent such attacks.

### STP Attack
- **Attack Description**: An attacker spoofs the root bridge in the topology, causing disruptions.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement root guard and BPDU guard to prevent unauthorized devices from becoming root bridges.

### Multicast Frame Spoofing
- **Attack Description**: An attacker spoofs a series of multicast frames, causing frames to leak into other VLANs.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Ensure that Layer 2 multicast packets are constrained within the ingress VLAN. No packets should be 'leaked' to other VLANs.
  - Consider using more capable switches that can handle such traffic effectively.

### VTP Attacks
- **Attack Description**: An attacker uses VTP to add or remove VLANs from the network, potentially causing significant disruptions.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Avoid using VTP in production environments. If VTP is necessary, ensure it is properly secured.
  - Configure VTP in transparent mode to prevent unauthorized changes.

### Private VLANs
- **Attack Description**: Traffic isolation at Layer 2 may not be sufficient.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Forward all traffic via Layer 3 to the private VLAN.
  - Use tools like Scapy for testing and validating configurations.

### VLAN Access Lists
- **Attack Description**: Unauthorized access to VLANs.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Configure VLAN access lists on router interfaces to control traffic.
  - Example:
    ```shell
    # vlan access-map map_name (0-65535)
    ```

### Spoofing Switches
- **Attack Description**: An attacker configures a system to spoof itself as a switch by emulating 802.1q or ISL.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Disable auto-trunking on unused ports.
  - Explicitly configure trunking for backbone switch-to-switch connections.
  - Do not use the user native VLAN as the trunk port native VLAN.
  - Do not use VLAN 1 as the switch management VLAN.

### Tagging Rules
- **Attack Description**: Misuse of tagging rules can lead to VLAN isolation breaches.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Ensure that the native VLAN is not assigned to any port.
  - Force all traffic on the trunk to always carry a tag.

### VMPS Security
- **Attack Description**: VMPS traffic is unauthenticated and can be misused for hijacking purposes.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Transmit VMPS traffic out-of-band or avoid using it altogether.
  - Manage switches securely using SSH, OOB, and permit lists.

### General Best Practices
- **Always use a dedicated VLAN ID for all trunk ports.**
- **Deploy port security and set user ports to a non-trunking state.**
- **Selectively use SNMP and treat community strings like root passwords.**
- **Have a plan for ARP security issues.**
- **Use private VLANs where appropriate to further divide L2 networks.**
- **Disable all unused ports and put them in an unused VLAN.**
- **Consider 802.1X for the future and ARP inspection.**
- **Use BPDU guard and root guard.**
- **Disable CDP whenever possible.**
- **Ensure DHCP attack prevention.**

By implementing these best practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your VLAN infrastructure and mitigate the risk of Layer 2 attacks.
