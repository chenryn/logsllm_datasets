Hi,
We use Visual Studio 2013 Premium Update 4 and develop applications in
TypeScript 1.4. We have a very serious issue, when we start debugging the
code, entering into another method in another class would freeze the whole
Visual Studio. It is then stalled for at least few minutes. The only way to
quickly work with the Visual Studio again is by terminating the Visual Studio
process from the task manager and restart the application again.
Any ideas on how to solve this issue? Thanks in advance.
By the way, I posted the same thing in CodePlex, I received a reply asking me
to use GitHub instead. Reference link:

Thanks again.
