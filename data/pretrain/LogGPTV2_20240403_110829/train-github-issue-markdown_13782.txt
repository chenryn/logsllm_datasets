Subject: Visual Studio 2013 Freezing During TypeScript Debugging

Dear Support Team,

We are currently using Visual Studio 2013 Premium Update 4 to develop applications in TypeScript 1.4. We have encountered a significant issue during the debugging process. When we attempt to step into a method in another class, the entire Visual Studio environment freezes for several minutes. The only way to regain control is by terminating the Visual Studio process via the Task Manager and restarting the application.

Could you please provide any suggestions or solutions to resolve this problem? 

Additionally, I have already posted this issue on CodePlex, where I was directed to use GitHub instead. Here is the reference link for your convenience:
[TypeScript Issue #2657](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2657)

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
