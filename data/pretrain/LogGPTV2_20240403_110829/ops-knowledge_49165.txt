User: How to manage code branches and release versions when using Git as a version control tool?
Assistant: Git, as a distributed version control tool, can help us manage code branches and release versions. The following are several commonly used management methods: 1. Branch management Using Git, we can create multiple branches to perform multiple development tasks at the same time. In general, we will create at least two branches, one is the main branch (also called mainline or trunk), and the other is the development branch. The master branch is used to store stable code versions, while the development branch is used for tasks such as developing new features or fixing bugs. When the development branch is done and tested, it can be merged into the master branch. 2. Release version management Git can manage release versions through tags. Put a tag on a specific node of the code base, indicating that the node corresponds to a release version, and give the tag a version number (such as 1.0, 2.0, etc.). When a new version needs to be released, a new tag can be placed on the new code node. 3. Practical application In actual application, we can take the following steps: (1) Create a master branch Create a master branch and make the first submission on it. (2) Create a development branch Create a new branch for new features or bugs, and develop and test on it. (3) Merge branch When the development branch completes the task and has been tested, it is merged into the main branch. (4) Putting a tag Put a tag on a node of the main branch, indicating that the node corresponds to a release version, and give the tag a version number. (5) Release version Deploy the release version to the production environment. The above are the Git code branch and release version management methods we usually use, but they are not absolute. The specific implementation must be flexibly used according to the specific project situation.
