User: I need to create spawn off a process in python that allows the calling process to exit while the child is still running.  What is an effective way to do this?
Note:  I'm running on a UNIX environment.
Assistant: Terminating the parent process does not terminate child processes in Unix-like operating systems, so you don't need to do anything special.  Just start your subprocesses with subprocess.Popen and terminate the main process.  The orphaned processes will automatically be adopted by init.
