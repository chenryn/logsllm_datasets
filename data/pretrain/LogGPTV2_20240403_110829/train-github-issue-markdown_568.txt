I have set up a 2-node Kubernetes cluster using Docker containers, following the instructions provided in the official Kubernetes documentation: [Docker Multinode Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.1/docs/getting-started-guides/docker-multinode.md).

Next, I created a secret and a test pod using the files from the `release-1.1` branch and the commit `ac3f023ab28ed4f4c4f88a3fb518e90f4a8d4749`.

### Commands Executed
```sh
kubectl create -f docs/user-guide/secrets/secret.yaml
kubectl create -f docs/user-guide/secrets/secret-pod.yaml
```

### Verification
Both the secret and the pod were successfully created:

#### Secret Details
```sh
$ kubectl describe secret test-secret
Name:           test-secret

```

### Issue
The secret directory inside the container is empty, as indicated by the logs:

```sh
$ kubectl logs secret-test-pod
error reading file content for "/etc/secret-volume/data-1": open /etc/secret-volume/data-1: no such file or directory
```

### Environment
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.04.3
- **Docker Version:** 1.9.1, build a34a1d5
- **Storage Driver:** AUFS on ext4

### Additional Logs
The kubelet's log contains multiple entries similar to the following:

```sh
W1210 15:25:08.504876    8522 container_manager_linux.go:278] [ContainerManager] Failed to ensure state of "/docker-daemon": failed to move PID 20479 (in "/user/1000.user/14.session") to "/docker-daemon"
I1210 15:25:09.337270    8522 fsHandler.go:87] failed to collect filesystem stats - du command failed on /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/5819740f39449d681e73c362cbdcef218454bc0e8ba4c442905069d803be0d13 with output du: cannot access '/var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/5819740f39449d681e73c362cbdcef218454bc0e8ba4c442905069d803be0d13': No such file or directory
 - exit status 1
...
```

### Question
What does the "FailedSync Error" in the pod's status mean? The kubelet's log is also full of lines indicating that the `du` command failed to access certain directories, but none of them are marked as errors.
