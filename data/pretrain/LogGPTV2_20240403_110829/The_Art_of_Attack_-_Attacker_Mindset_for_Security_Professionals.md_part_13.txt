ignore. But you must build up this skill over time.
In building observation as a skill, and a sort of ‘‘muscle,’’ there is
good news: you literally can’t do it wrong. Observation is in the eye
of the beholder, after all. However, the areas that may serve you best
to build up and train on, specifically for AMs, would be as follows:
Walking and “Talking” Walking and listening to other
people talking is a skill— and quite a hard one. Try to walk
past people talking and pick up what they are saying. Better yet,
pretend you are on the phone talking, and see if you can still pick
up what they are saying. It’s quite a hard task, but a very useful one.
106 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
There’s every chance you end up doing this in a building as you
enter or try to remain within it.
Listening I don’t mean listening in the same way a therapist
does, but listening to your surroundings is a massive skill to have,
and it’s a skill that so many people lack. That is not meant in a
pejorative way; it’s just that this is rarely a learning curve for most
people: finding the origin points of sounds makes surveying your
surroundings— especially on jobs where you must be aware but act
disengaged— easier. It also trains the ear to listen for new things
and, over time, recognize more of them without having to analyze.
This skill will play into your ambient listening skills, too. It is espe-
cially useful for vishing calls—b eing able to ascertain where your
target is will increase your level of insight and chances of success.
Looking Detail for the sake of detail is our enemy. It can be inef-
ficient, creating problems instead of creating results, and it can
lose you time in the field. There are jobs where details are the bulk
of the daily tasks that will be carried out—a ccountant, journal-
ist, proofreader, editor, and data analyst are all examples. Parts of
any attack will require attention to detail. Details for the good of a
task or an operation should be lauded. Design can also be impor-
tant in social engineering. Designing items in replication requires
a detail-h eavy approach at times. Things like typography and font
size can be crucial because the security guard to whom you give
your faked employee ID badge will recognize it as such in what
science says is less than a second. After visual input hits the retina,
the information flows into the brain, where information such as
shape, color, and orientation are processed. It has been shown that
the human brain can detect an image in as little as 100 millisec-
onds. A security guard might be able to tell your badge is a fake in
about 0.9 seconds if it’s got the wrong typography or font size. So,
details can be important. Observing them as best you can and as
often as you can will go in your favor overall.
Surveying All right, this one is different, but it truly will serve
you. The idea is pretty simple. Pick a place, sit or stand still, and
take a “mental photo.” My method includes what I call “story sen-
tences”; if I were staring at a building, I would describe it as if
Information Processing 107
I were writing the world’s blandest novel. “The eight- story build-
ing glistened as the glass reflected the sun.” Is this a bit weird?
Probably. Does it work? Yes. It makes recall a lot easier. Recall will
serve you two ways: it will help you with reports, and it will help
you with recon— ultimately “recording” information will help you
throughout the entire life cycle of an engagement.
Observation vs. Heuristics
If information is what forms intuition, there must be a heavy
connection between observation and intuition. However, there’s
another variable in how we calculate information and come to a
conclusion: enter heuristics. Heuristics are mental shortcuts; they
aren’t guaranteed to be logical or rational, but they help a person
reach a decision. They reduce cognitive load and can be effective for
making immediate judgments. The downside is that they can result
in irrational or inaccurate conclusions.
Heuristics
Heuristics are quite useful in making quick decisions. Heuristics
are based on simple logic that is self- evident. But self- evidence isn’t
always accurate and comprehensive. For example, imagine your
doctor used only heuristics to diagnose you. You go in with symp-
toms that include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint
pain, and swollen lymph nodes— these are symptoms all pretty
common with the flu. But actually, you have Lyme disease. Your
doctor cannot (and hopefully does not) use only what is empirical
evidence to reach their diagnoses. Other types of information are
also critical—t he observation of data, like blood tests, for example.
In the early 1970s, an alternative theory proposed that peo-
ple use heuristics instead of rationally weighing relevant factors
to make judgments much of the time. An example of a heuristic-
based judgment is the now famous case of “Linda,” originally docu-
mented by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1982, 1983) in
108 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
their paper, titled, ‘‘The Conjunction Fallacy in Probability Judge-
ment,’’ published in the Psychological Review in 1983, volume 90,
number 4, page 229). When participants read a paragraph about
Linda (in italics below), the vast majority fell prey to an error.
Behold Linda
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken and very bright. She majored
in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues
of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-
nuclear demonstrations.
1. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
2. Linda is a bank teller.
Around 80 percent of people thought that the first statement
that followed the paragraph was more likely to be true than the sec-
ond. This cannot be, though. The first statement cannot be more
probable because it includes the second. The supplementary infor-
mation is not aligned in any way with what we first read about
Linda. The probability of the first statement is ranked higher than
the second simply because it is more similar to the given descrip-
tion of Linda. This is what is called the similarity heuristic. Most of
us use this sort of method to judge, rather than our knowledge of
probability. It turns out that statistical analysis is a mysterious thing
to most folks.
However, this is not to say that heuristic diagnosis is not val-
uable. Using heuristics can be an intellectual skill. The ability to
determine in environments what is likely, even if you don’t have all
of the information, can be a massive help. But why do I say this?
Why show you that heuristically thinking is flawed only to pivot
and show you it actually has value?
Two reasons: The first is that, using any type of heuristic as an
alternative to logic and reasoning, should not be tolerated. There is
room for this mode of thought, but it should not be your standard.
The second is that there are times as an attacker that you will have
to rely on heuristics. For example, in the story I told you earlier
Information Processing 109
about the Manhattan bank I was trying to get into, I used the availa-
ble heuristics to determine that no one would see me sucking in my
tummy like a circus performer as I bypassed the security turnstile.
The self- evidence I was using told me that no one was around—I
heard no footsteps or voices, or any movement at all. And glancing
over the upper walls and ceilings made me think that no security
cameras would capture me in the act. Using this mode of thinking
as a standard can be hard to get out of for some people. Logic and
reasoning are not the most natural modes of thought for everyone.
However, there’s one good exercise to use to learn if you’re using
heuristics: ask yourself if the evidence you’re seeing would stand
up in a court of law. I could not have gone into a court and categori-
cally stated that there were no cameras around. I could only say that
to the best of my knowledge and based on empirical evidence, there
appeared to be no cameras around.
To reiterate, using heuristics is advantageous when finding an
optimal solution through reasoning is either impossible or imprac-
tical, such as when in a time crunch, or when faced with a decision
for which no data is available or the data is thought to be heavily
flawed or skewed.
Observation vs. Intuition
Intuition refers to our ability to know or understand something
without reasoning or proof, also known as a gut feeling. Some ath-
letes exhibit levels of intuition that are beyond all reckoning. In
Major League Baseball, for example, a pitch takes less than half a
second to reach home plate, but a batter cannot afford to wait that
long to put their body into action. The player’s muscles, nerves, and
brain manage to work together to hit the ball in an astonishingly
short amount of time.
Once the ball leaves the pitcher’s hand, it travels at around
85 to 95 mph, taking only 400 to 500 milliseconds to reach home.
Information about the pitch—i ts speed, trajectory, and location—
takes about 100 milliseconds, or a tenth of a second, to go from eye
110 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
to brain. It takes another 150 milliseconds for the batter to start a
swing and get the bat over the plate. This leaves about a quarter of a
second at most for the hitter to decide where to swing the bat. This
is a form of intuition at play.
Malcolm Gladwell begins his book Blink (Back Bay Books,
Little, Brown) by telling the story of the purchase of a seemingly
priceless Greek statue known as a kouros by the Getty Museum
in Los Angeles. Before purchasing the statue, the museum carried
out its due diligence, consulting with scientists and lawyers who
all concluded the piece was the real thing after scientifically test-
ing the materials and perusing the documentation. They gave the
seller a monstrous $10 million and then took it to show to some art
historians and specialists in Greek sculpture. As it turned out, the
Getty had been conned. The art experts they’d unveiled this statue
to needed just one look to know that it was a fake. An immacu-
late, giant, smooth, sculptured- to- within- an- inch- of- its- life fake.
To confirm, they did not need to test the statue’s claim of veracity
or spend countless hours studying it. Intuitively, they knew it was
a fake right away.
Intuition, reductively, can be seen as the ability to draw con-
clusions quickly, without the need for deliberation or conscious
analysis. High- caliber intuitive conclusions transpire when you
can recognize a situation that follows a particular pattern you have
seen before, have knowledge specific to previous situations that
fit the pattern, or have general knowledge that’s applicable to the
new situation. So, if intuition is the ability to understand some-
thing immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning,
how do you get to that point? An art expert didn’t exit the womb
as such. When was the last time any of you heard of a child who
was able to consistently tell a Picasso apart from a Crayola sketch
without study?
My position is that keen observation is the underlying and bol-
stering principle at play in intuition, at least to begin with. An art
expert has, for example, seen so much in their specialized field,
analyzed, and has given definitive answers on their assumptions so
Information Processing 111
often that they are then able to build that experience into what is
recognized as intuition. In other words, years of observing the real
thing can make spotting a fake insanely easy.
Another example that showcases the successful use of intuition
comes from expert chess players. Chess experts have gone through
a process of perceptual learning, allowing them to intuitively rec-
ognize chess configurations as units rather than having to analyze
every configuration presented during a chess game. Intuition is
formed from experience and acute observation.
Because intuition is based on a large number of variables
whose relationships are difficult to classify, intuition cannot be
programmed, which, in cybersecurity at least, is perhaps it’s most
brilliant value. Intuition is personal, and it becomes better with
practice and experience. It is something that can be used to your
own advantage as an attacker. I suspect that a strong correlation
exists between time spent ethically attacking and increased intui-
tion. Responses become more automatic as less concentration is
required for technique. When needed, an automatic response dur-
ing a crunch- time scenario will improve your performance. Over-
thinking due to nerves or anxiety will cause your AMs to slow
down, so improving the skills of your offensive attacker mindsets
(OAMs) and defensive attacker mindsets (DAMs) will also refine
your intuition capabilities.
However, without years of experience or a specialized back-
ground, your intuition alone cannot be trusted. You will have to
build it up over time. Attackers with a strong mental game are bet-
ter at quickly dealing with those unexpected moments, disallowing
them from detracting from their focus. Again, I arrive at the con-
clusion that mental games of chess played with information you
have about an attack will result in easier successes and improved
agility and intuitive moves. Nothing will beat experience itself, of
course. You can get this from capture- the- flag events (known as
CTFs), lab practice, hypothetical attacks, and real jobs. For a list of
known resources, see the notes section of this book on its website
(www.theamsbook.com).
112 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Using Reasoning and Logic
Using reasoning and logic above heuristics and intuition is more
resource intensive for the brain. Also, most of the problems that you
will face in a day are not mathematical or logical in nature. How-
ever, reason must be employed when the stakes are too high to rely
on using intuition alone and where data is available.
Most recently at Social-E ngineer LLC, where I currently work,
we intuitively agreed that we faced an insider threat. All of the signs
were there. For example, the employee was accessing information
without any explicable need and downloading it. The employee had
a growing number of devices and locations with access to sensi-
tive data. They were voicing disagreement with coworkers and were
performing poorly, connecting with clients out of band and work-
ing very odd hours. Intuitively, they felt like an insider threat. It
turned out this person wasn’t. But it felt like they were. To usher the
feelings we had to the side, we looked at all the facts, and the person
was just not performing. There was no malicious intent or threat. A
balance has to be struck between intuition and reasoning— guessing
and parsing the data—a lesson I later discovered in a revered Man-
hattan bank. Let’s jump back to that New York skyscraper and pick
up where the story last left off, first taking a look at something you
can never plan for: luck.
No one ever said an element of luck is not involved in attack
execution. Two in a row is something to be marveled at, though.
That the man I’d hitched a ride with was a bank employee— that’s
luck checkbox number one. Luck checkbox number two was a
direct result of that: as I walked around the 35th floor, nodding to
people as if I was their coworker and this was not the very first
time they were seeing me, I happened across an empty desk. It had
only a few things strewn across it, but among them was a sight so
beautiful, wonderful, and surreal that I almost choked on my own
happiness. A key card sat there, on its back, looking up at me as if
it no longer wished to be alone. I scooped it up, slid it in my pocket,
and listened for any sounds that signaled a change in atmosphere.
My peripheral vision seconded this analysis; thankfully, no excuses
Information Processing 113
were needed as to why I was hovering around an empty desk, slyly
snatching things off it. No one had bothered to look up— which,
looking back, is probably luck checkbox number three. I would like
to amend my earlier statement: no one ever said an element of luck
is not involved in attack execution. Three in a row is something to
be marveled at, though.
I moved through the office, completing a loop that ended back
at the turnstile I’d very recently circumvented. I looked at the gap
I’d slid through only minutes before, thankful I didn’t have to do it
again. Tucking your pelvis in and squashing your own butt down
is an odd activity to do once in a day, never mind twice. I simply
swiped my way to the 38th floor, never looking back. I stepped out
of the elevator onto the floor I’d been assured I’d never make it to.
A sense of smugness that should be punishable filled my body. And
it was; that feeling was, in the end, my downfall.
I fell into my most used character— comfortable with her sur-
roundings, with the air of “I have a right to be here” about her. A
group of men walked toward me, chattering among themselves.
Ordinarily I would only nod at them or smile ephemerally. Talking
with a group that’s all one gender intuitively feels like a bad idea, as
the opposite gender in a group of one. However, I was still high on
smugness, so I went against my own intuition, reasoning, and logic
and talked to all of them at once. My apparently new and strong idi-
ocy allowed me to start the conversation with the stellar salutation
of “Hey!” I said it to the whole gaggle of men, now only feet away
from me, apparently attempting to stop all of them in their tracks.
I continued with the equally brilliant “Where’s the CFO’s office? I
have papers for him!” I lifted the briefcase up a little as if it were
some sort of proof.
Fail 1: I stopped a whole group of men with no good reason.
There are name signs on the doors. I could’ve looked for the office
or asked one person.
Fail 2: I told them what I was there for. They didn’t need to
know, and I left myself with negative ability to pivot. When already
in and you are instigating interaction, let people ask. Don’t just tell
them everything. You will paint yourself into a very tight corner.
114 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Fail 3: Let’s pretend the CFO’s name was Jeff. Well, Jeff’s
voice came from within the gaggle and said pretty abruptly, or at
least that’s how it hit me in the moment, “I’m Jeff. I am expecting
no papers.”
Gulp. Idiocy and smugness are a bad combination.
Observing People
Inanimate objects and large, mainly unchanging environments are
one thing, but observing and understanding people is another skill
