User: I just got a Mac and shifted from Windows and installed Tensorflow using Docker and everything is working fine, but I want to run a python script that I have from before. Is there any way to run a python script in docker on a Mac, using the terminal?
Assistant: Lets assume you have a script my_script.py located at /Users/awesome_user/python_scripts/ on your mac
By default the tensorFlow image bash will locate you at /notebooks.
Run this command in your terminal: docker run --rm -it -v /Users/awesome_user/python_scripts/:/notebooks gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow bash
This will map your local mac folder /Users/awesome_user/python_scripts/ to the docker's local folder /notebooks
then just run from the bash python my_script.py. Also running ls should reveal your folder content
