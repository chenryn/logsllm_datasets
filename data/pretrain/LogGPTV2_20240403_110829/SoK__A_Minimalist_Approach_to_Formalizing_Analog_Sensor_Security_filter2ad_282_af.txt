output of multiple transducers, i.e., multiple chains of transfer
functions. It was commonly suggested as a defense by prior
work [44], [45], [68], [70], [86], and can be applied to systems
which can bear the cost of adopting multiple sensors. Spectral
fusion can be thought as both Component Modiﬁcation (when
a single transducer sufﬁces for such multi-band operation) and
Component Fusion (when multiple transducers are required).
Petit et al. [46] suggested utilizing multiple wavelengths to
enhance lidars’ resiliency against transduction attacks. Tem-
poral fusion is typically more affordable than spatial as it
does not typically require extensive hardware modiﬁcation,
and would be close to Component Modiﬁcation. Previous work
has suggested the use of sensor fusion as a mitigation. Xu et
al. [68] proposed a special ﬁlter to remove maliciously injected
echoes in ultrasonic sensors by examining echo consistency
over multiple pulse cycles. Davidson et al. [98] suggested
weighted RANSAC with momentum to increase resiliency
against spooﬁng attacks. It not only utilizes RANSAC but also
gives weights to each feature according to how consistent it
was in earlier frames. Petit et al. [46] also discussed probing
objects multiple times to limit the effectiveness of attacks.
Additionally, it may be possible to combine spatial, spectral,
and temporal fusion schemes to further enhance security.
VI. PREDICTING ATTACKS AND DEFENSES
High-level analysis of the signal injection and measurement
shaping steps shown in Section IV may aid in the prediction
of new attacks or defenses. A series of injection and shaping
steps behave similarly across various sensor types. We brieﬂy
discuss how these similarities may allow one to synthesize new
attacks through careful analysis. Lastly, we show how someone
using our model may have been able to predict previous work
and follow with a few predictions of future work.
A. Prediction Concepts
1) Attack Chains: Signal injection and measurement shap-
ing steps may be grouped together to provide a quick, human-
readable description of the mathematics behind an attack or
part of an attack. For these series of steps, which we term

TION ATTACKS. USING OUR METHODOLOGY, OLDER WORK CAN SERVE
AS A BASIS (BASIS) TO RETROSPECTIVELY PREDICT SUCCESSFUL AT-
TACKS (RETRO.). LAST, WE USE PRIOR WORK, INCLUDING THOSE RETRO-
SPECTIVELY PREDICTED, TO PREDICT FUTURE WORK (FUTURE).

attack chains, noting the order of steps is crucial. Different
arrangements of the same steps describe separate attack chains.
Additionally, attack chains share the abstraction of physical
components from the steps they are based on, enabling con-
ceptual comparison between transduction attacks even across
different sensor types and components. Lastly, most attacks
may be described as a chain of fewer than ﬁve steps, providing
a quick, human-readable attack notation based in mathematics.
2) Cross-Sensor Transferability: The same attack chain that
employs the same steps (Table II) in the same order should
behave similarly despite sensor type or components exploited.
This property results from how injection and shaping steps are
a mathematical abstraction above the physical layer.
Defenses deﬁned by which injection or shaping steps they
mitigate (Table III) should also behave similarly despite sensor
type or exploited components. Once again, this is because of
steps being mathematical abstractions above the physical layer.
3) Attack Chain Synthesis: One may be able to combine
two or more known sub-chains into new attack chains. One
common method to create a new attack chain is to substitute a
sub-chain in an existing chain with another sub-chain that ac-
complishes the same goal. The new sub-chain may accomplish
the same mathematical goal as the original, but utilize different
physical components or principles to do so. In doing so, the
new sub-chain may succeed on a sensor or device the original
chain did not. In particular, simply exchanging a known attack
chain’s injection step with a new one may enable new attacks.
B. Attack Prediction: Case Studies
Analysis of signal injection and measurement shaping steps
may allow an attacker to predict new transduction attacks
via the cross-sensor transferability and attack chain synthesis
concepts discussed above. We ﬁrst present a case study to show
how such an analysis may have aided in predicting previous
attacks across microphones, accelerometers, and gyroscopes.
Secondly, we provide examples of possible future attacks as
an example of our prediction methodology.
1) Retrospective Attack Prediction: Attack chain analysis
of prior work can elucidate conceptual similarities in attacks
across different sensors. These similarities, along with the
ideas of cross-sensor transferability and attack chain synthesis
(Section VI-A), may have allowed someone to predict these
attacks. Shown in Table IV are several attack chains from prior
work. To demonstrate our prediction methodology, we show
how the ﬁrst two attacks may have assisted in predicting the
second two.
Basis 1: In 2013, Foo Kune et al. showed how to use electro-
magnetic waves to inject audio signals into microphones [47].
For both listed attacks, electromagnetic injection creates a ma-
licious, amplitude modulated (AM) signal in the sensor. Then
the [IMD → ﬁltering] or [ﬁltering → aliasing] sub-chains
demodulate the injected signal using different principles. The
demodulation results in the malicious audio signal remaining
in the system.
Basis 2: In 2015, Son et al. [42] described how to use acoustic
waves to disrupt drones. First, acoustic waves inject a signal
via vibration of the MEMS gyroscope’s sensing mass. This
signal is not ﬁltered correctly, resulting in errant drone control.
Prediction 1: In 2017, Trippel et al. [59] demonstrated how
to use acoustic waves to control MEMS accelerometer output.
Step analysis may have assisted in predicting one of the at-
tacks. First, analysis of an accelerometer reveals that the steps
of injection via acoustic waves, improper ﬁltering, and ADC
aliasing are possible for MEMS accelerometers. Secondly,
analysis of the acoustic injection step shows how the step may
inject signals similarly to the second basis listed above, but
also that these signals can be amplitude modulated like with
the ﬁrst basis. Third, the concept of cross-sensor transferability
implies that the sub-chain [ﬁltering → aliasing] should act
similarly to the ﬁrst basis. Last, the concept of attack chain
synthesis allows the combination of the injection step and the
[ﬁltering → aliasing] sub-chain to predict this attack.
Prediction 2: In 2017, Zhang et al. [90] showed how ultrasonic
waves could control microphone output. Yet this attack may
also have been predicted via step analysis. First, step analysis
reveals that attackers may use ultrasonic waves to inject
an amplitude modulated signal into the microphone. While
employing different physical principles, the injected signal is
an AM signal similar to the ﬁrst basis. Secondly, the AM
demodulation sub-chain, [IMD → ﬁltering], is also the same
as in the ﬁrst basis. Last, attack chain synthesis allows for
these sub-chains to combine into a new attack chain, predicting
this attack. Despite different signal types (electromagnetic vs.
acoustic), different components for the IMD step (ampliﬁer
vs. transducer), and different frequencies (MHz vs. kHz), our
analytical methods reveal the conceptual similarities of these
attacks.
2) Possible Future Attacks: To further demonstrate our pre-
diction methodology, we predict possible future attacks using
analysis of prior work similarly to the previous retrospective
prediction section.
Prediction 1: Step analysis predicts that acoustic waves may
be able to control a MEMS magnetometer’s output. Nashimoto
et al. [99], brieﬂy mentioned that acoustic waves did af-
fect MEMS magnetometer output. This seems similar to the
acoustic injection steps for other MEMS sensors in prior
work [42], [59], [86]. Additionally, the improper ﬁltering step
may be available on some magnetometers similarly to other
MEMS sensors [42]–[44], [59], [86], [99]. The aliasing step
should also be available as magnetometer have analog-to-
digital converters. Thus, one may be able to construct the
[inject (acoustic) → ﬁltering → aliasing] attack chain on
the magnetometer, which is the same as found in previous
work [59]. The ability to construct an attack chain known to
work on another sensor suggests that the attack is possible,
despite the different sensor types.
Prediction 2: Step analysis also predicts that an additional
attack on MEMS accelerometers may be possible by employ-
ing the [injection (acoustic) → IMD → ﬁltering] attack chain
demonstrated in previous work [90]. The IMD step may be
available on the ampliﬁer of some MEMS accelerometers,
just as it is on ampliﬁers on other devices [47], [80], [100].
Additionally, attackers have already utilized acoustic injection
and ﬁltering steps on MEMS accelerometers [43], [59]. Thus,
one could construct the full attack chain listed previously.
C. Defense Prediction: Case Studies
The property of cross-sensor transferability for injection and
shaping mitigations (Section VI-A) can aid defenders in pre-
dicting successful mitigations. To demonstrate this predictive
ability, we analyze how one may have predicted mitigations
presented in previous work. Speciﬁcally, we use TX and RX
randomization as case studies.
1) RX Randomization: Defenders may use RX random-
ization to mitigate an attacker’s ability to demodulate am-
plitude modulated signals via aliasing on an ADC. Trippel
et al. [59] proposed this scheme in 2017 for use on MEMS
accelerometers, and later Tu et al. also proposed a similar
scheme on MEMS gyroscopes [43]. However, step analysis
suggests that RX randomization may mitigate other attacks
using ADC aliasing. For example, in an attack that uses a
microphone’s ADC to demodulate an AM signal [47], an RX
randomization scheme may mitigate the ADC aliasing step
and defend against such an attack.
2) TX Randomization: Defenders may use TX randomiza-
tion on active sensors to detect or prevent a variety of attacks.
Researchers have suggested or demonstrated several cases
of TX randomization such as with magnetic encoders [96],
[106] and radars [95]. Step analysis also indicates that a TX
Randomization would apply to other active sensors, such as
ultrasonic sensors [68], [70] and lidars [45], [46].
VII. DISCUSSION
A. Improving the Simple Sensor Security Model
Our model merely serves as an initial step towards formaliz-
ing analog sensor security. Looking forward, we will continue
to improve the model
to more thoroughly cover existing
and forthcoming studies. For example, it may be desirable
to abstract new measurement shaping steps exclusive to in-
band attacks on active sensors that manipulate measurement
by adjusting the injection time [45], [46], [70] or signal
frequency [96]. Incorporating emerging and potential attacks
that modify the transfer functions, e.g., by injecting EMI to
the power lines of ampliﬁers [112] or heating temperature-
sensitive components, may also be a direction for future work.
B. Improving Research Methodology
We hope and believe our model and related analytical
methods will improve transduction attack research method-
ology. This model highlights the importance of discovering
new signal injection and measurement shaping steps, as well
as defenses for these steps. Our methodology demonstrates
how these steps can apply across a wide range of sen-
sors (Section VI-A). Thus, research based on the discovery
or analysis of steps may have a broader impact on sensor
design as a whole rather than only target a single sensor
or system. Additionally, using the provided terminology can
assist researchers and sensor designers in understanding new
transduction attacks and how the attack may apply across
sensors as a whole.
C. Predictive Defense Schemes
We discuss how the model enables two predictive defense
schemes that enhance sensor resiliency to transduction attacks.
• Predictive Attack Defense. A sensor designer could employ
the strategy of implementing a defense for every theoretical
attack on a sensor. The model allows a designer to predict
theoretical attacks on a sensor they are designing (Sec-
tion VI). From this, the designer can adopt a simple strategy
of ensuring there is at least one defense for each theoretical
attack. In addition to the beneﬁt mitigating possible future
attacks, this approach may reduce the loss of time and money
associated with redesigning, manufacturing, and distributing
a new sensor each time a new attack is demonstrated against
a sensor.
• Predictive Step Defense. Predictive step defense employs a
different approach of designing a mitigation for every known
signal injection or measurement shaping step in a sensor.
In the model, a successful transduction attack requires all
steps in its attack chain. Mitigating any step in the chain
will mitigate the entire attack. So, a strategy that mitigates
every known injection or shaping step will prevent all attacks
from exploiting those mitigated steps, including attacks that
have not yet been theoretically constructed. Thus, after
this defense scheme is employed, an attacker would need
to construct an attack chain of entirely comprising newly
discovered steps. Therefore, predictive step defense provides
a scheme for designers to protect
their devices against
unknown theoretical attacks at design time.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Security researchers and practitioners can use our simple
sensor security model to better express and understand attacks
employing physical signals to manipulate sensor output, and
defenses against them. This model employs transfer functions
and a vector of adversarial noise to allow comparison of
attacks across sensors of different types. The model allows
some predictive capability and enables new defense schemes
to make sensors more resilient against future attacks.
