Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-invert-regular-
expression-matches-with-javascript has an issue. Please describe how to
reproduce it, and include links to screenshots if possible.
My regex is returning the value 7, but assert(test === 36)  
![screenshot](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4dfb439e6a632f5f44cb60cd0338ccb7ece840d1a762d6d176f9b23a8f52bd3e/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4b33474e5753762e6a7067)
Second test is passing with an invalid test:
'You should be using the following expression /+S/gi to find the spaces in the
testString.'
This test is passing with the regex /\s/gi  
/+S/gi makes no sense - as it is searching for all matches of the literal '+'
followed by a literal 'S'
