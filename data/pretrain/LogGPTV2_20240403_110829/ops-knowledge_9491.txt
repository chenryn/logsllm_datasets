User:  How to set permissions for Linux system files?
Assistant: In the Linux system, you can use the chmod command to set permissions for files. The following are common file permission setting methods: 1. Set permissions to read and write execution: $ chmod 777 filename 2. Set permissions to read-only: $ chmod 444 filename 3 . Set permissions to read and write only: $ chmod 600 filename 4. Set permissions to execute only: $ chmod 111 filename 5. Use numbers to indicate permission settings: $rwx rwx rwx 111 111 111 = 777 110 110 110 = 666 101 101 101 = 555 100 100 100 = 444 011 011 011 = 333 010 010 010 = 222 001 001 001 = 111 For example, set the file permission to read-only: $ chmod 444 file name Among them, 4 means read-only permission, because read-only Permissions are available to all users, so three 4s indicate that all users can read the file.
