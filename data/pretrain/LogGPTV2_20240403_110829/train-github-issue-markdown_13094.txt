##### Bug report
I find that the polygonOffset do not work if turn logarithmicDepthBuffer on.
I have a model which contains several totally overlapped mesh surface. And I
try to use `logarithmicDepthBuffer = true ` to solve it, but no lucky. And I
try to use polygonOffset, but it only works when `logarithmicDepthBuffer =
false`.
Is it a bug or just the feature of webglrender?
