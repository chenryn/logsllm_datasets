### Bug Report

**Issue Description:**
I have encountered an issue where the `polygonOffset` does not function as expected when the `logarithmicDepthBuffer` is enabled. Specifically, I have a model that contains several completely overlapping mesh surfaces. I attempted to resolve the z-fighting issue by setting `logarithmicDepthBuffer = true`, but this did not solve the problem. Additionally, I tried using `polygonOffset`, but it only works when `logarithmicDepthBuffer = false`.

Is this a bug, or is it an intended feature of the WebGLRenderer?
