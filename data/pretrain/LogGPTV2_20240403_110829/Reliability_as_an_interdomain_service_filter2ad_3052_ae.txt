31, 2004, we observe that REIN reduces trafﬁc intensity from 350%
to only 80% of bottleneck link capacity: the interdomain bypass
paths reduce the trafﬁc intensity by 270% on the bottleneck link.
The preceding traces illustrate the effectiveness of REIN and the
robust path-based algorithm at several intervals during two days.
We next summarize the overall performance during the whole week
period in which we have evaluated REIN and robust path-based
TE/FRR. Figure 7(a) shows the reduction of trafﬁc intensity by
REIN for one-link failure scenarios. We observe that the reduction
is relatively small. However, this is expected since the TE/FRR
algorithm spreads trafﬁc well and the network is not stressed un-
der one-link failures, as illustrated by Figure 5. REIN is effective
when there are severe network failures. Figure 7(b) shows the ef-
fectiveness of REIN under two-link failure scenarios. For around
90% of the intervals, REIN reduces trafﬁc intensity on the bottle-

neck link by 20% to 60% of the link capacity of the bottleneck link.
This is signiﬁcant reduction of trafﬁc. For the remaining 10% in-
tervals, the reduction of trafﬁc on the bottleneck link by REIN is
even more signiﬁcant: 220% to 270% of the capacity of the bottle-
neck link. These intervals include those starting from interval 208
in Figure 6(a). They show clearly the beneﬁts and effectiveness of
REIN.
US-ISP: The evaluation of performance under failures on Abilene
is mainly worst-case analysis, due to the lack of accurate failure
logs. Next, we evaluate the performance of REIN and the robust
path-based TE/FRR algorithm on US-ISP, with a replay of both
trafﬁc demands and the failure logs. In our experiments, our in-
terdomain bypass selection algorithm has selected 12 bypass paths
from 3 neighboring networks of US-ISP.
For conﬁdentiality, we do not report the absolute trafﬁc intensity
on the bottleneck link for US-ISP. Instead, we report relative bot-
tleneck trafﬁc intensity normalized by the highest bottleneck trafﬁc
intensity under the optimal routing without failures over the evalu-
ation period.
Figure 8 shows the reduction of the normalized trafﬁc intensity
on the bottleneck link by REIN, for both our robust path-based
TE/FRR algorithm and the oblivious routing/bypass algorithm of
Applegate et al. [5]. We observe that the distribution of trafﬁc re-
duction by REIN for US-ISP is more uniform than that for Abilene.
Also, the maximum reduction of normalized trafﬁc intensity on the
bottleneck link is also smaller than that of Abilene (i.e., from 270%
to 118% and 35%). One possible reason for these differences is that
US-ISP has an over-provisioned network with high redundancy. In
addition, the failure logs we have collected may not include all se-
rious, but possible failure scenarios. Despite these differences, we
nevertheless note that REIN may still reduce trafﬁc to the bottle-
neck link signiﬁcantly. We observe that there exist failure cases
where REIN can reduce the normalized trafﬁc intensity on the bot-
tleneck link by 118% and 35% when the network uses oblivious
and robust respectively.
One potential concern of the REIN scheme is its impact on the
peering links and the links in the neighboring networks when an
network diverts trafﬁc to them during a failure event. In all of our
evaluations, the trafﬁc diverted on an interdomain bypass path have
never exceeded 60% of the exported capacity of the path for Abi-
lene, and 70% for US-ISP. Thus, the beneﬁt of REIN is achieved at
a moderate cost to the neighboring networks.
5.3 Tradeoffs in REIN
The preceding results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our
framework and the robust path-based TE/FRR algorithm. A key
implementation technique that we have used is the coverage-based
path generation algorithm. It is a general path generation technique
that can be applied to any ﬂow-based routing and allows explicit
tradeoff between optimality and scalability. Below we demonstrate

how to control the tradeoff by varying the target percentage value of
the adaptive path generation algorithm presented in Section 3.4.2.
In order to measure optimality, we use computation of the optimal
oblivious routing [6] as the benchmark problem, and measures the
optimality of a routing by the oblivious ratio that it achieves. We
show results for Abilene and US-ISP.
Figure 9 shows the oblivious ratio achieved by different path sets
with different target coverage percentages used during path gener-
ation. It also shows the average number of paths per OD pair re-
quired to achieve each target coverage percentage. We can see that
higher coverage leads to higher number of paths required per OD
pair and better performance. Using 3 LSP paths in Abilene and 5
in US-ISP can achieve near-optimal performance. Note that the ﬂat
part of the performance-ratio curve at the low coverage region is
due to the fact that all those coverage ratios can be achieved using
only one path for each OD pair.
We also evaluate the tightness of the bound provided by Propo-
sition 1, and the results are shown in Figure 10. We can see that
after 70% coverage, our bound is tight and is a good prediction for
the performance using those paths.
6. RELATED WORK
The importance of reliability in communication networks has
long been recognized, and there is a large body of related work.
REIN is part of the efforts to improve network reliability at low
cost.
In the past, most networks rely on link layer techniques such as
SONET rings to protect against failures (e.g., [17]). Later, due to
the relatively high cost of SONET protection and the lower cost
and better ﬂexibility of IP, many networks turned to the IP layer to
handle failures [21].
Many techniques for optimizing routing adaptively under poten-
tial failures have been developed (e.g., [11, 14, 17, 23, 33, 34]).
These techniques are referred to as restoration techniques.
A potential drawback of the restoration techniques is their rela-
tively slow response time, which may not be able to meet the re-
quirements of some mission-critical applications (e.g., VPN net-
works carrying VoIP trafﬁc). Thus, the restoration techniques are
supplemented by MPLS-based protection techniques, which pre-
compute the rerouting paths and quickly reroute trafﬁc upon failure
detection (and before routing convergence) [38]. Such techniques
are major features of modern routers.
Our REIN framework can improve the effectiveness of both restora-
tion and protection techniques, by utilizing them over an augmented
intradomain topology with virtual links that correspond to the ad-
ditional interdomain bypass paths. The added virtual links increase
the redundancy available to these techniques, and therefore can im-
prove their performance in most cases.
A key requirement of protection techniques is to compute the
rerouting paths. Many algorithms have been proposed (e.g., [24,
25, 26, 27]). In particular, Applegate et al. [5] presented the opti-
mal oblivious fast rerouting algorithms. However, the formulation
in [5] uses ﬂow-based routing, which is not readily implementable
in the current Internet. In this paper, our coverage based path gen-
eration technique achieves implementable optimal fast rerouting.
The REIN framework is complementary to those that focus on
protecting interdomain links (e.g., [41]). For example, multihom-
ing has been introduced as a way to improve network performance
(e.g., [3]) and reliability (e.g., [9]). The difference between mul-
tihoming and our approach is that multihoming is used to protect
links at the border and outside the IP network, while our architec-
ture focuses on protecting intradomain links. In [13], the general
capability of setting up interdomain label switched paths (LSPs)
is discussed along with many potential applications. However, the
deployment of interdomain LSPs appears to be challenging.
Another technique to improve reliability is overlay networks (e.g.,
[4, 20]). Although overlays provide ﬂexibility and can detect fail-
ures faster than BGP response time, they rely on transport layer
timeouts to detect network failures, which can be much slower than
the link layer detection used in REIN. Additionally, since it is oper-
ated by IP networks, REIN has much better visibility of the network
and ability to conduct trafﬁc engineering than overlays.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed a novel framework called reli-
ability as an interdomain service to improve the redundancy of IP
networks at low cost. We have also developed robust algorithms
to efﬁciently utilize network resources under failures. We have
