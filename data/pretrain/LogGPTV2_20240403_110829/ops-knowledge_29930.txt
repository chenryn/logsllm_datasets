User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 delete_large_data 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks whether a table has too many tuples to be deleted. If the number of deleted tuples is greater than or equal to the specified threshold, it is considered a root cause and will be deleted in the future. If the number of deleted tuples is less than the threshold, the function checks whether there is a delete operation on a table with a large number of tuples. If so, it is also considered a root cause and the suggestion is to make adjustments to the business. If neither condition is met, it is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- n_tuples_deleted
- deleted_tuples_threshold
- live_tuples
- deleted_tuples_rate
- rows
