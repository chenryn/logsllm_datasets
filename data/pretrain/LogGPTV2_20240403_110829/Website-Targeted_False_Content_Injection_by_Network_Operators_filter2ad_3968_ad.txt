# Autonomous System Analysis for Content Injection

## 4. Identifying the Autonomous System of the Injecting Hop
Given the IP address of the hop, we can identify the autonomous system (AS) to which it belongs, thereby revealing the entity responsible for injecting the packet. To achieve this, we utilized public databases that contain current BGP advertisements, allowing us to map the given IP address to its corresponding AS. BGP advertisements are generally more accurate and up-to-date than Internet route registries [23].

### Caveats in the Procedure
1. **Initial TTL Value**: The initial TTL value of the injected packet may not be one of the common default values. In such cases, the analysis cannot be performed. For instance, based on the TTL values, we conclude that this is the case for the injections in the 'jiathis', 'uyan', 'mi-img', and 'icourses' groups.
2. **Asymmetric Routes**: Not all routes on the Internet are symmetric. If the path from the client to the server is different from the path from the server to the client, the analysis will produce incorrect results. This issue is addressed in the next subsection.
3. **On-Path Assumption**: The procedure assumes that the injecting machine resides on-path. However, an on-path machine monitoring the traffic could trigger the injection from a remote machine, causing the forged packet to travel on a different path than the legitimate packets.

| Injection Group | Autonomous System (AS) |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| jiathis         | 17816, 4837            |
| uyan, icourses  | 4134, 4812             |
| mi-img          | 38182                  |
| gpwa            | 6943                   |

## Table 4: Operators of Suspected Injecting Autonomous Systems
| AS Number | Operator                                   |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 17816     | China Unicom                               |
| 4837      | China Telecom                              |
| 38182     | Extreme Broadband (Malaysia)               |
| 6943      | Information Technology Systems (US)        |

### Analysis Results
In Table 3, we list the AS numbers for the destination sites and the suspected injectors. The table includes only those injection groups where the estimated number of hops the injected packet traversed is between 3 and 30, and does not exceed the path length between the client and the server.

In all successful analyses, the forged content was injected 2-5 hops away from the destination site. Since the injection groups are largely independent, this suggests that our assumptions are reasonable. The injector is located in the same AS as the destination site, which is the most logical location for altering content for all web users accessing the targeted site.

### Table 4: Operators of Suspected Injecting Autonomous Systems
Two of the largest network operators in China, China Unicom and China Telecom, are suspected of practicing content injections. Additionally, these operators' ASs originate injections for different groups, implying the presence of multiple injector mechanisms.

For the 'gpwa' group, the operator is Information Technology Systems, which is also responsible for the content of the destination site, gpwa.org. Given strong indications of malicious intent, we assume the attacker compromised a router in the suspected AS.

## Using Traceroute from the Server-Side
To address the caveat of assuming symmetric routes, we used RIPE Atlas [26], a global network of probes that can execute measurements including traceroutes. RIPE Atlas hosts 6 probes in 3 ASs that host destination sites with forged content. Table 5 lists these ASs and the corresponding injection groups.

### Table 5: Autonomous Systems Hosting RIPE Atlas Probes
| AS Number | Injection Groups                          |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 4812      | jiathis                                    |
| 4134      | szzhengan, server erased, uyan, icourses   |
| 4808      | tupian                                     |

For each probe, we executed a traceroute to the edge network where the corresponding injection events were identified. While this method may still have errors, it provided additional validation. The analysis for 'szzhengan' and 'server erased' injections yielded the same suspected AS (4134), while 'tupian' injections indicated a different AS (4134 instead of 4812). These ASs are operated by the same company, China Telecom.

## 6. Proposed Mitigation
The best mitigation against TCP injection attacks is to use HTTPS. However, many websites do not support HTTPS, and some serve login pages over HTTP. A client-side mitigation measure that monitors incoming HTTP traffic and blocks injected TCP segments can protect users even if they must use HTTP.

### Naive Mitigation
A naive approach involves delaying every incoming packet for 200msec to ensure it is not an injected packet. This ensures all injected packets are blocked but incurs significant delays, degrading the user's browsing experience.

### Improved Mitigation
An improved approach leverages the observation that most injected packets have abnormal TTL or Identification values. Only packets with these anomalies are delayed, reducing the overall delay. Algorithm 2 in Appendix E details this improved mitigation algorithm.

### Table 6: Performance of Mitigation Algorithms
| Algorithm | Load Time Increase | False Negatives |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Naive     | 120%               | 0%              |
| Improved  | 12%                | 0.3%            |

The naive algorithm imposes a 120% increase in page load time, while the improved algorithm incurs only a 12% increase with a negligible false negative rate of 0.3%.

## 6.1 Experiments
We evaluated the algorithms using two datasets: a benign dataset (200 most popular sites from Alexa) and an injected dataset (captured sessions). The algorithms were tested for page load time increase and false negatives. The results show that the improved algorithm is significantly more efficient.

## 7. Related Work
Several studies have investigated Internet traffic alteration, including [20, 34, 28, 39]. These works employed server-centric approaches and found various types of content modifications, often due to local software, security gateways, and ISPs. Some studies [38, 33, 35, 13] have also explored out-of-band injection and mitigation techniques.

## 8. Conclusions
This work reveals a new aspect of false content injection on the Internet, showing that some network operators inject false content regardless of the users. Our analysis, based on extensive monitoring, identified 14 groups of content injections, primarily aimed at imposing advertisements or compromising clients. Most financially-motivated injections originated from China, with indications of involvement from China Telecom and China Unicom.
