User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is the optimal web application configuration on a VPS? Currently I'm running our web application on a LAMP stack on a VPS with the following specs:


768MB memory
Xen PV
Ubuntu Maverick


What I'm finding is that web server requests are frequently timing out.  Interestingly, this is on my development configuration so it's getting very little traffic but despite that I'm getting timeouts.  I'm wondering if Apache isn't somehow memory starved.  I'm planning on converting it over to ngix but in the mean time I would like to determine what is causing the timeouts. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Assistant: You've not said if you're using something like FastCGI with PHP in your Apache build. If you're using PHP, Ruby or Python and not using that, then it's possible the spawn process required by each script execution is causing the timeouts.

However, I think overall you've not given enough information to really give many specific suggestions. Look in your Apache error log and if possible post the errors as an update, that's probably the first place to look.
