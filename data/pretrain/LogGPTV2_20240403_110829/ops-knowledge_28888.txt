User: I saw there are two methods for getting data from the datastore:
fetch() and run()
Regarding fetch the documentation says:
Note: You should rarely need to use this method; it is almost always better to use run() instead.
I don't understand the difference between the two.
I am new to GAE and Python, please help me understand.
Thanks
It says that run() is asynchronous which I don't understand cause unlike JavaScript, once you run the Python script for the site, the html is frozen, right?
Assistant: You can run (with run) multiple datastore queries in parallel to improve latency. This has nothing to do with your resulting HTML. The resulting HTML should be the same.
