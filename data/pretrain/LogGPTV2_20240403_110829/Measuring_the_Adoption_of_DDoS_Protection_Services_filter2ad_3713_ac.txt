and troughs. We smooth shorter and smaller anomalies out
by taking the median reference count over a time window of
several weeks, while the large anomalies are cleaned man-
ually. This way we largely separate always-on from on-
demand use. Fig. 5 shows the combined growth of the nine
providers relative to the start of our data set, in about 50%
of the global domain namespace. The overall expansion of
the zones involved is also shown. A trend in the adoption of
DPSs becomes apparent, which is largely driven by Cloud-
Flare, DOSarrest, Incapsula, and Verisign (cf. Fig. 3). Other
providers such as F5 Networks and CenturyLink contribute
to incidental decrease (e.g., the dip in March 2016). As
shown, DPS use has grown by 1.24× over 1.5 years, which
exceeds the overall expansion of 1.09×, from about 140M to
152M domains.
We applied the same procedure to our six-month data set
for .nl and the Alexa Top 1M. Fig. 6 shows the results. A
growth trend of 10.5% against 1.8% is shown for .nl, and
for Alexa the growth is 11.8%.

4.4 Dynamic Behavior
4.4.1 Third-party Anomalies
We have traced many of the larger anomalies shown for
each DPS to on-demand or always-on use by third parties,
and in one case to a DNS issue at a third party. A few
examples will follow. For Incapsula, Web site develop-
ment platform Wix causes repeated swings of millions of
domain names11, such as the peak in April 2016 (cf. 1(cid:13))
that involves 1.76M names. A second anomalous example
for Incapsula is the increase in June 2016 (cf. 2(cid:13)), which we
traced to “an opportunistic private equity fund around In-
ternet domain names.”12 Most of Verisign’s larger anoma-
lies can be traced to ENOM (a registrar) and ZOHO, ac-
counting for changes of up to 700k domains.13 The Febru-
ary 2016 anomaly for CloudFlare (cf. 3(cid:13)) involves ∼247k
Namecheap-hosted domains.14 The anomalous trough on
November 22nd, 2015 for Akamai (cf. 6(cid:13)) was caused by
∼716k domains that can be traced back to Sedo Domain
Parking.15 Our ﬁnal example is the signiﬁcant drop of do-
mains in February 2016 for CenturyLink (cf. 5(cid:13)). We
traced this to a platform that oﬀers “Expert tools to manage
domain registration, sales and monetization.”16 Some of the
observed anomalies involve multiple providers. For example,
11Wix domains normally route
to Amazon AWS
(AS14618) through a amazonaws.com CNAME. During diver-
sion, Wix name servers answer A records in various Wix-
owned preﬁxes that are announced by Incapsula.
12This increase of about 170k domain names can be traced
to SiteMatrix (a domainer).
13Several ENOM-owned /24s route to Verisign (AS26415)
during diversion, and to ENOM (AS21740) normally. Simi-
lar for ZOHO, with two preﬁxes normally in AS2639.
14The domains share a Namecheap NS SLD (i.e., registrar-
servers.com) that answers CloudFlare-announced addresses.
15We infer that this was a DNS issue at Sedo, since the
number of measured domains with a sedoparking.com NS
SLD also dipped that same day.
16Here, a Fabulous-owned name server, starts giving A
answers for ∼355k domains that previously routed to two
preﬁxes announced by CenturyLink’s AS3561.

4.3 Protection Methods
As outlined in Section 2.1, various ways exist to use the
DNS to divert network traﬃc to a DPS. Our reference anal-
ysis has shown that a DPS may support more than one way
(cf. Table 2). Fig. 3 shows per DPS a breakdown of the
various use cases (the marked NS, CNAME, and AS lines).
Diﬀerence in use among the nine DPS providers can be
discerned, even where providers support the same DNS use
cases. For example, if we look at the use of delegation, we
ﬁnd that CloudFlare’s authoritative name servers are used
signiﬁcantly, by about 75% of CloudFlare-using domains
on average (compare CloudFlare’s NS and overall, top line).
For Incapsula, however, only about 0.02% of domains use
delegation, i.e., are using the Incapsula NS Protection ser-
vice (this NS line is not visible). Verisign sits somewhere in
the middle. During most of the ﬁrst eleven months (March
2015 until February 2016), the number of Verisign-using do-
mains that used delegation (i.e., their Managed DNS service)
was even higher than those that diverted traﬃc (compare
Verisign’s NS and AS lines). We suspect that the dominant
use of CloudFlare’s Authoritative DNS among its customers,
is because the service is free.10
10We analyzed for a single day the set of full names of
CloudFlare’s authoritative name servers, most of which are
given a male or female name, followed by .ns. and cloud-
ﬂare.com, the NS SLD reference. There are 403 such names
on April 30th, 2016, with kate.ns.cloudﬂare.com the most-
referenced (by 112k domains).

4.4.2 Daily Fluctuations and Repeated Anomalies
To study if repeated anomalies involve the same set of
domain names, we analyzed the daily ﬂux per provider in
terms of ﬁrst seen and last seen domain names. This way,
if protection is turned on and oﬀ several times for a set of
names, the names involved will contribute to inﬂux at most
once, and to outﬂux at most once. Fig. 7 shows per DPS
the delta of ﬁrst seen and last seen counts, in two-week time
windows. As shown, repeated anomalies in Fig. 3 can be
traced to the same sets of domain names18. For example,
the large inﬂux for Incapsula in March 2015 indicates that
many of the same domains were involved in the anomalous
plateau that starts in May 2015. A second take-away is
that over time some providers contribute more gradually to
DPS adoption than others, of which CloudFlare is a prime
example, since its inﬂux is rather spread out.
4.4.3 On-demand Use
Our outline of some of the larger anomalies shows that
many can be traced to on-demand use, while some we sus-
pect are always-on domains because of only an upward or
downward edge. Since our measurement period is ﬁnite we
cannot easily determine if an opposing edge can be found
outside the measurement period. Moreover, a domain that
shows a single period of use,
i.e., peak, could either be
a short-lived always-on customer, or brief on-demand use.
Thus, it is not trivial to classify the type of DPS use. To
gain more insight into dynamic behavior among the various
providers we estimate for each a set of on-demand domains,
which is done on the basis that the domains show at least
three peaks over 1.5 years. For the sets of domain names,
we analyzed the peak durations in days over the 1.5 year
period. Fig. 8 shows the results as the CDF of peak occur-
rences. For providers that show signs of highly anomalous
behavior from day to day, the majority of peak occurrences
17Here, two Wix-owned preﬁxes switch back and forth
from F5 Network’s AS55002 to Incapsula’s AS19551.
18Time grouping and variations in the customer base of
third parties can change the ﬂux magnitudes somewhat.
are short-lived (i.e., P (duration <= days) = 0.8). A good
example is Neustar, with 80% of all peaks lasting four days
or fewer, which we suspect is because their always-on solu-
tion is a hybrid19 in which traﬃc is not continuously diverted
to the cloud.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this work we have shown that the adoption of DDoS
Protection Services has grown signiﬁcantly in the over 50%
of the global domain namespace we studied. Our results
show a relative growth of 1.24× over the previous 1.5 years,
which surpasses the overall expansion of 1.09× of the con-
sidered namespace (i.e., .com, .net, and .org). Our results
also show adoption trends in .nl and among domains on
Alexa’s Top 1M list, with growths of 1.11× and 1.12×, re-
spectively, over a period of six months.
Our methodology can be used to analyze how domains
divert traﬃc to a DPS, and whether or not optional ser-
vices (e.g., name server protection) are used. In our results
we reveal diﬀerences in use of protection methods among
the considered providers, even in cases where the compared
providers support similar services. For some providers, only
a small percentage of domains use delegation, which poten-
tially leaves a part of a domain’s DNS infrastructure (i.e.,
the authoritative name server) susceptible to DDoS attacks.
Finally, our results show that a large contribution to the
user base and adoption of DPS providers is made by third
parties, examples of which are Web hosters and domainers.
Some of these larger players activate or deactivate DDoS
protection for millions of domains from one day to the next,
either by leveraging the DNS to divert traﬃc, or by having
the DPS announce one or multiple IP preﬁxes.
