User: Please analyze the WebSocket communication process based on the TCP protocol, and give an example of how to use WebSocket to achieve game interaction.
Assistant: The WebSocket communication process based on the TCP protocol: 1. The client initiates a WebSocket handshake request. The handshake request contains some special HTTP headers, such as Upgrade, Connection, and Sec-WebSocket-Key, etc., and the protocol version number is 13. 2. The server responds to the WebSocket handshake response. The handshake response also contains special HTTP headers, such as Upgrade, Connection, and Sec-WebSocket-Accept. At this time, the handshake is successful. 3. WebSocket communication At this point, the WebSocket communication has been established, and the two parties can carry out data transmission, and the data format is frame. Each frame consists of a data header and a data body, where the data header includes opcode, mask, payload length, masking key, etc. 4. Close the WebSocket communication Either party can send a close frame to end the WebSocket communication. An example of using WebSocket to realize game interaction: Suppose there is a real-time backgammon game, assuming it is divided into two players, and the board status of the two players is synchronized in real time: 1. The Client initiates a WebSocket connection request and connects to the game server. 2. The server responds with a WebSocket connection success response message, and the communication is established successfully. 3. When the player plays chess, the Client sends a message to the Server to inform him of the chess position. 4. After receiving the move message, the server synchronizes the chess position to another player's board, and sends the current game board status to the first player. 5. After the status of the board changes, the Clients of the two players receive the status update message and update the status to the interfaces of the two players. 6. If a client closes the WebSocket connection, the server will clean up accordingly. If any party wins, the game result can be synchronized to another player according to the game rules, the WebSocket connection is closed, and the game ends. The game interaction realized through WebSocket can achieve more real-time game interaction, and is more concise and efficient, avoiding frequent HTTP requests and responses.
