User: I have developed my first .app for mac, written in python and would like to share this .app with some friends.
I have converted the python scripts via py2app. Then I have one .app and compress it to an .dmg file. 
I share this .dmg file with the guys and for one, this is working fine. (He has already python installed) 
The other people canÂ´t open the .app file, they get error messages. After an intensive search I got it. They have no python installed. 
Now my question: How can I include a "one click python installation" in my .dmg file (or as package?!)
Assistant: If you create the .dmg, you can setup a background image that tells users to move your application to the /Applications folder. If your application needs no extra setup, this is preferred, or a (Mac OS X created) .zip file with it.
The package option is better if some additional setup, or scripts checking for Python dependencies, are required.
