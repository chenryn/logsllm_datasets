User: Would it be possible for some type of Python script to check services running on a linux box, and integrate with a google app script, so it would then populate a google doc spreadsheet stating whther a service is running or not ?
Assistant: Yes. You would need to authorize it the first time and implement oAuth from the script though. I strongly suggest that you switch to the Google Drive API.
