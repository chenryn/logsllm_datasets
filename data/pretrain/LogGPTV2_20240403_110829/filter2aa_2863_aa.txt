### NCC Group Whitepaper
### Secure Messaging for Normal People

**Abstract:**
As "secure" messaging programs and protocols continue to proliferate, cryptographic experts often debate their intricacies. However, there is a significant gap in information that helps the general public differentiate between these programs and their features. This paper aims to address this gap by discussing the types of attacks that can be used against various messaging models and how secure messaging features can defend against them. The goal is to provide tech-savvy individuals, who may not be cryptography experts, with the knowledge to make informed decisions about which cryptographic applications to use.

### 1. Introduction
Security and privacy remain top concerns for the public, and many users want to know how to keep their communications private. At the same time, users are being offered more communication choices than ever before, with some options claiming to be "secure." By the end of this paper, you will understand the methods adversaries use to access your communications and the features messaging systems offer to protect against such attempts.

#### 1.1 What is a message?
For the purposes of this paper, a "message" refers to any information you wish to send to another person or group. This includes phone calls, SMS, email, video chat, text chat, and similar forms of communication. However, communications between your computer and a server, for example, are not considered messages in this context.

A messaging client is the system or application you use to send messages. This can range from a traditional phone to a specialized messaging application on a computer.

#### 1.2 Cryptography is magic
There are numerous cryptographic algorithms designed for different situations. The choice of algorithm, implementation flaws, and other factors can significantly impact the security of your data. However, these details are beyond the scope of this discussion. For the purposes of this paper, you can assume that "encrypted" means "impossible for anyone else to read or modify," unless otherwise stated. In reality, you would need cryptography and application security experts to validate the actual algorithms and implementations used.

Even though we assume encryption is unbreakable, adversaries can still find other ways to access your data. This paper aims to explain these methods and how to mitigate them.

#### 1.3 Cryptobabble
This paper aims to simplify complex concepts, but there are a few key cryptography terms that will be used. Here are some definitions to help clarify:

- **Key**: A secret value that "unlocks" an encrypted message.
- **Public Key/Private Key**: These come in pairs. You distribute your public key to everyone, while keeping the private key to yourself. Anyone with your public key can send an encrypted message that only your private key can decrypt. Think of it as distributing blueprints for a lock that only your key can open.
- **Signatures**: Another use for public keys. If you have my public key, you can verify that a given message actually came from me. The message can be sent unencrypted, but the public key can still validate its authenticity. Imagine having a sample of my handwriting (public key) to verify a signed document (private key).
- **Fingerprints**: In cryptography, a fingerprint is a short value that represents a longer one. Keys can be very long (e.g., 925 digits), so we use math to create a manageable representation (e.g., a 13-digit fingerprint). Machines use the full key, but humans can use fingerprints for verification. It's called a fingerprint because it uniquely identifies the larger value.
- **Trust**: When we say we "trust" someone, we mean we rely on them to vouch for someone's identity. This can be an individual or a more abstract entity.

### 2. Your own threat model
Determining the "best" encrypted chat program is subjective because everyone has different needs. To decide what level of security you need, first understand who is trying to attack you and what they are trying to take.

#### 2.1 Adversary types
We will discuss four types of adversaries:

- **Opportunistic, Low-resource adversaries**: These attackers are not targeting you directly and are unwilling to commit much effort, skill, or time. Examples include novice troublemakers, corporate/educational monitoring systems, and advertising analysis systems.
- **Targeted, Low-resource adversaries**: These attackers are specifically after your information but lack extensive resources. They include targeted hackers, organized crime, corporate espionage, and harassers.
- **Opportunistic, High-resource adversaries**: These attackers are not targeting you specifically but have significant resources for bulk surveillance. They are likely government programs conducting large-scale data collection, monitoring, and filtering.
- **Targeted, High-resource adversaries**: These are likely government actors who have already zeroed in on you. While this paper may not provide much protection against this class of threat, it will explain why your choice of secure messaging program is unlikely to be effective.

#### 2.2 Why are you keeping secrets?
When choosing a messaging system, consider the value of the information you want to keep secret and how valuable it is to potential adversaries. Both factors inform the level of security you should implement.

Different types of data have different values. This paper focuses on the value of the actual content of your messages and the steps you can take to protect it.
