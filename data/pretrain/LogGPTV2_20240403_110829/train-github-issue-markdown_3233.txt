When using the scipy.optimize "nelder-mead" method it is currently not
possible to specify the initial simplex values. Instead scipy automatically
sets this to be (1+0.05)*x0. If a priori information on the optimization
problem is available it makes sense to specify this.
I have found several pull-requests in scipy that address this issue (#3974,
#3634, and #3729) but none of these have been merged and all have not been
edited for more than half a year.
Is there reason these did not get merged? If so what would be required for
something to be merged into a main scipy release?
(If an issue is not the way to raise a discussion, my apologies. It appears
the link to the mailinglist on the main page is broken)
