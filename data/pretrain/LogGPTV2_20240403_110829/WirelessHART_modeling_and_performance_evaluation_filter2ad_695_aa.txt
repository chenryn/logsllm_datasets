Abstract—In process industries wired supervisory and control
networks are more and more replaced by wireless systems.
Wireless communication inevitably introduces time delays and
message losses, which may degrade the system reliability and
performance. WirelessHART, as the ﬁrst international standard
for wireless process supervision and control has received notable
academic attention. This paper models WirelessHART networks
with link failures using Discrete-time Markov chains and eval-
uates the network performance in a typical WirelessHART
environment with respect to delay and reachability.
The evaluation shows that although the performance of Wire-
lessHART is inﬂuenced by several factors, it is capable to deliver
reliable service in typical industrial environments. The proposed
model can also be used to predict path performance and to
provide routing suggestions.
I. INTRODUCTION
In traditional process industries, wired systems are deployed
for supervisory and control applications. In recent years, a new
tendency to replace the wired system by wireless networks
emerged. The migration towards wireless technology has sev-
eral advantages for the industrial control system with respect
to ﬂexibility,
installation cost and maintenance. However,
wireless communication inevitably introduces time delays and
message losses, which may degrade the system performance.
WirelessHART [1], [2], as the ﬁrst international standard
for wireless process supervisory and control, became the main
stream of this migration and received notable academic atten-
tion [3],[4]. Even though performance models for Wireless
sensor networks exist [5],
into
the performance of WirelessHART. This is due to the fact,
that the protocol WirelessHART is considerably different to
general sensor networks. Related work has shown that in some
cases simple Markov models are sufﬁcient to capture the key
characteristics of observed package delivery in WirelessHART
[6].

little insight
This paper generalizes the performance model presented in
[6] by adding an explicit link model that takes into account the
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and the Bit Error Rate (BER) and
by allowing different reporting intervals and inhomogeneous
links.
We present a hierarchical DTMC model that consists of
two parts, i.e., an explicit link model as mentioned above and
a path model that inherits the link availability from the link
model. We show how to derive several measures of interest
in order to evaluate the performance of a typical environment

from different perspectives. In addition, the proposed model
can be used to predict path performance and to provide routing
suggestion. The modeling approach and evaluation results can
be used as reference and suggestion in industrial settings.
Note that, a tool has been developed to automatically derive
the underlying model of a fully speciﬁed network to directly
compute measures of interest.
The paper is further organized as follows. Section II pro-
vides the relevant insight into the protocol that is necessary
to model a WirelessHART network. Section III introduces a
detailed link model based on the Binary Symmetric Channel
model. The hierarchical modeling approach is presented in
Section IV and an algorithm is provided to construct the un-
derlying DTMC model of a WirelessHART network. Measures
of interest are introduced in Section V and an example path is
evaluated. The evaluation of a typical WirelessHART network
is presented in Section VI before the paper is concluded in
Section VII.
II. WIRELESS HART
The WirelessHART architecture as shown in Figure 1 is
designed to be user friendly, reliable and inter-operable and
normally consists of the following three main components:
Field Devices are attached to the process equipment. They
can be either wire-powered or battery-powered. These network
nodes encompass sensors, actuators and wireless components.
The sensors are responsible for collecting monitoring data such

as ﬂow speeds, ﬂuid levels, or temperatures. Actuators, e.g.
valves and pumps, perform the control commands they re-
ceive. Gateways, like the network hub, enable communication
between Host Applications and Field Devices in the Wire-
lessHART Network. Each gateway can support one or more
Access Points. The Network Manager is responsible for the
conﬁguration of the network, i.e., scheduling communication
between ﬁeld devices, management of the routing tables and
monitoring and reporting the health of the network.
WirelessHART uses feedback to control
the outputs of
industrial instruments. The control loop is realized through
the components of the WirelessHART network. Field devices,
including sensors and actuators, can be regarded as the source
nodes and relay nodes in a WirelessHART network. The
gateway, as the network routing destination, has a wired
connection to the controller and then to the application host.
WirelessHART supports Pseudo-random frequency channel
hopping to avoid channel overlapping and channel blacklisting
[7] to further reduce interference. Channels that are highly
utilized by other networks and suffer constant interferences
will be put into the blacklist and excluded from the active
channel list.
The data link layer of WirelessHART deﬁnes strict 10
millisecond time slots and utilizes Time Division Multiple
Access (TDMA) to provide collision-free and deterministic
communications. Speciﬁcally, only one transaction is permit-
ted in each frequency channel at a given time slot across the
entire network.
The network layer determines how the messages are routed
from a source node to the gateway and vise versa, since
ﬁeld devices do not necessarily have a direct forwarding
path to the network gateway. According to the WirelessHART
data sheet [8], a variety of routing algorithms are supported:
(i) upstream and downstream graph routing for maximum
reliability and managed latency (ii) source routing for ad-
hoc communications and conﬁrmation of path viability (iii)
broadcast, multi-cast and unicast transmissions.
The WirelessHART MAC layer is slotted and synchronized,
taking advantage of TDMA to provide collision-free medium
access. A series of consecutive slots forms a so-called super-
frame. In the following, the size of a super-frame is denoted
Fs.
All ﬁeld nodes share the same super-frame and slots are
speciﬁcally allocated to ﬁeld devices to transmit messages
uplink/downlink. A super-frame starts with the Analog Input
(AI) blocks, which sample and digitalize the sensory data
and send them in different uplink slots to the gateway. The
gateway runs the PID control function, generates the output
message and sends it back to the ﬁeld devices in different
downlink slots. The received output messages go through
Analog Output (AO) blocks to close the control
loop. In
practice, the execution time of AI, AP and PID control blocks
are very short compared to a transmission slot [9].
A. Reporting interval
Traditional control protocols sample sensory data once and
then execute the control loop once. However, WirelessHART
allows longer reporting intervals, i.e., sensory data is not
measured and forwarded in every control loop.
Without compromising control stability, it is desirable to
reduce the frequency at which measurements are taken and
communicated in order to save wireless communication over-
head and extend the life time of batteries at ﬁeld devices. In
the following the reporting frequency is denoted Is, which
indicates that
the measurement back to
the gateway every Is super-frames. Hence, the length of a
reporting interval is Is ∗ Fs.
B. Message life cycle
the nodes report
The sensory messages may suffer an extremely long delay
that exceeds its reporting interval. These out-dated messages
are not useful for real-time monitoring and control applica-
tions, thus the system limits the message life span. When a
message is generated in a sensor node, it is stamped with
a born time Tborn and attached with a Time-to-Live (TTL)
ﬁeld. With each time slot, the TTL ﬁeld is decreased by one.
However, uplink messages ‘sleep’ during downlink slots and
do not decrease their TTL and vice versa. As soon as the TTL
reaches zero, the message is discarded from the system to keep
the registers clean.
C. Communication schedule
To guarantee timely and reliable data delivery, the com-
munication schedule is ‘centrally computed at the network
manager, which has global knowledge of the network state,
and then disseminated to all devices in the network [10].
Following the formal description of WirelessHART in [3], the
communication schedule η deﬁnes which link is allowed to
transmit per slot. The total length of the schedule is the uplink
size of the super-frame Fup = 1
2 Fs.
III. LINK MODELS
In the following, we use the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) model [11] to describe the transmission of a single bit
and a two-state link model to describe the transmission of a
message.
The BSC model is one of the most fundamental channel
models and widely used for the analysis of communication
systems. The transmitted bit is denoted xk ∈ {0, 1}, the re-
ceived bit yk and the transmission error probability is denoted
pk, which is independent of the past and future bits. Formally,
this is referred to as bit error rate (BER) and is an important
channel parameter that varies according to the noise level and
the applied modulation technology.
Consider a dynamic link where the received signal strength
is above an acceptable threshold part of the time, and below
the threshold with strong noises [12]. This can be modeled as
a DTMC with two states, namely UP and DOWN, as shown
in Figure 3. Recall, that WirelessHART uses TDMA with

the next slot. And this new channel has a high probability
to be up, because the network manager maintains a list of
active channels. All the down channels are banned to the
blacklist after a certain period of time. However, there is still
a small probability that the new channel is not working either.
Therefore,
the recovery
transition probability prc is chosen to be very close to 1, but
not equal to 1.

synchronized and slotted time, which facilities the modeling
of wireless links as a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC).
In the UP state, the transmission error probability is negligi-
ble, however in the DOWN state, the received signal strength
is so low that the error probability is very high. In case the
link is UP, the entire message will be transmitted successfully
without any bit error; in case the link is DOWN, the message
transmission fails due to one or more bit errors and the
message needs to be re-send later. The state of the link remains
unchanged during one slot and may change in the next slot
with failure probability pf l and recovery probability pcr.

WirelessHART radio used the modulation technology
OQPSK (Offset quadrature phase-shift keying). According to
[13], the Bit Error Rate of OQPSK modulation in a AWGN
(Additive white Gaussian noise) channel is given by:

(cid:33)

where erf c() represents the complementary error function,
and Eb/E0 represents the energy per bit

spectral density ratio, which is a normalized Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) measure and can be regarded as the ”SNR per
bit”. The received SNR can be measured using pilot packages
that are transmitted from one node to the other via the wireless
link.
The successful transmission of each bit (with probability 1−
BER) then follows a Bernoulli distribution, hence, assuming
the typical WirelessHART message is L bits long, the failure
probability is given by:
pf l = 1 − (1 − BER)L.

As speciﬁed by the standard [14], the 2.4 GHZ frequency
band is divided into 16 non-overlapping frequency channels.
WirelessHART instruments use a pseudo-random channel hop-
ping to reduce the interference with other networks, such
as IEEE802.11b/g (Wi-Fi) which operates in the same ISM
frequency band. In other words, whenever the link suffers
a bad frequency channel, it will hop to a new channel in
This section proposes a hierarchical DTMC model
that
describes how messages are forwarded along an uplink path
in WirelessHART networks. A state s in the resulting model
represents the age of the messages at each node on the path.
Hence, for a path with n hops, the state descriptor is a tuple
of size n: (age1, age2, . . . , agen).
The state space then consists of all possible age tuples
on a path during a reporting interval, as deﬁned by the
communication schedule. The resulting DTMC consists of
mainly transient states and the following two categories of
absorbing states: (i) Goal states, indicate that the message
reached the gateway at a certain age ai = a0 + (i − 1) ∗ Fup
for i ≤ Is, where Fup represents the uplink frame-size and a0
represents the transmission slot of the last link connecting to
the gateway in the communication schedule η. For a reporting
interval Is, the path DTMC has Is goal states, since the
transmissions towards the gateway are scheduled always in the
same slot of different super-frame cycles. (ii) Discard states
indicate the drop of a message due to a TTL value that has
reached zero. This is similar to the concept of ‘package loss’
that appears in some literature.
