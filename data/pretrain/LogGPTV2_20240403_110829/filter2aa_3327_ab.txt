as an illustrative example. Reactions to outbreaks of a disease often lead to political and public
pressure. Missing delivery schedules may cause contractual sanctions and bad publicity.
3. Stages of Cyber-Physical Attacks
An attacker targeting a remote process may not immediately be gifted with complete knowledge of
the process and the means to manipulate it. An attack may have to go through several stages before
the evil goals can be achieved (Fig. 3.1). Perfect knowledge is never achieved and the attacker may
need to circle back to previous stages or recursively repeat her exercises at the same stage.
Figure 3.1: Stages of cyber-physical attacks
3.1
Access
Access is the stage most resembling traditional IT hacking. In general, the attacker needs code
executing somewhere in the victim’s network to manipulate the process and thus has to ﬁnd some
way in.

Chapter 3. Stages of Cyber-Physical Attacks
A process network is usually connected to a business network and a ﬁeld network along with
various regulatory links relevant for any hazardous substances used. Along with all the data streaming
off the control network that feeds corporate and third party systems, process control systems have
many of the same needs as IT systems. Patches and anti-virus updates must ﬂow into the network.
Control commands must also ﬂow out of the network to ﬁeld equipment. Regulatory data must be
sent to various agencies. Sometimes the data must be sent in real time. These data ﬂows can be
potential ways into the process network. This stage is largely the same as hacking into any other
network.
For inspiration and examples the readers may check the following references. Get your malware
in via SCADA application [24] or whitelisting security service [25]. Select attractive vulnerability
from [21], ﬁnd vulnerable Internet facing devices as described in [36], exploit [4]. Rootkitting
techniques for ﬁeld devices (sensors, actuators) can be found in [34].
3.2
Discovery
This refers to discovering information about a plant from documentation. Without detailed knowl-
edge, it is unlikely that an attacker can achieve more than nuisance. Blindly trying to destroy a
process by overheating a tank, for example, will probably only result in exercising the emergency
shutdown logic and the pressure relief valves.
Espionage. Plants can be highly proprietary. If ten chemical engineers were tasked with building
a talcum powder plant, they may build ten very different processes. Even if they were restricted
to the exact same chemical process, they could make different choices in the design of the plant.
They might choose different vendors for pumps and valves. That in turn would inﬂuence the sizing
and placement of various pipes and holding tanks. That in turn would change the way the plant is
controlled and the design of the control loops.
Espionage and reconnaissance. The attacker must thus reconstruct the layout of the plant and
how it carries out its functions. This is the most difﬁcult and time consuming of the stages. There
are several data sources that describe the process. The attacker may ﬁrst study general information
on the chemistry, kinetics, and thermodynamics of the physical processes of interest. This can be
done by consulting open literature as well as proprietary information of process design companies.
Operator screens are meant to be a human readable. Regulatory ﬁlings will describe the inner
workings of safety or environmental related subsystems. Engineering diagrams may be stored in
change management systems electronically so changes in the physical process can be matched to
changes in the control logic. This part of the discovery stage may also involve espionage.
Typical documents on plant design are Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID), One-Line
Diagrams which often contain information on safety interlocks, Cause & Effect Diagrams, Cable
Schedule Diagrams, Project Interconnection Diagrams and others. Instrument I/O (input/output)
Lists contain a list of instruments which serve as input or output of the control system. This list will
contain such information as type of instruments and their location, range of set points, instrument
tags and loop numbers, service descriptions, etc.
The indispensability of this attack stage have been realized by attackers LONG time ago. From
what is made public, the APTs targeting industrial and research organizations were in action already
in 2006 [2] and probably earlier [54]. The massive spying on global oil, energy, and petrochemical
companies were carried out in 2009 onwards [41, 11]. The attackers appeared to be especially
interested in design documents, formulas, manufacturing processes and research materials. While a
large number of espionage campaigns took place in the past years [54], one of them deserves closer
3.3 Control

attention as it also included reconnaissance capabilities2006 [20]:
Using OPC, the malware component gathers any details about connected devices and
sends them back to the C&C for the attackers to analyze. It appears that this component
is used as a tool for intelligence gathering. So far, we have not seen any payloads that
attempt to control the connected hardware.
As always: we are living in interesting times. It is just a matter of time until “next generation”
malware capable of process control (see next section) will be caught in wild.
3.3
Control
In dynamic systems such as cyber-physical systems, the values of process variables change with
time according to the laws of physics. However, transitioning of a process from one state to another
is in most cases not instantaneous and adheres to the well-known fact that “things take time”. At this
stage the attacker tries to discover the dynamic behavior of the process which can be described in the
form of simple differential equations dy/dt = f(y,u), where u is an independent variable and y is
the dependent variable which are related by cause-and-effect relationships.
It is easy to discount the difﬁculties involved in making a process misbehave in a predictable
way. The various pieces of a process are connected together in physical relationships. Increasing the
temperature in a vessel will usually increase the pressure as well. Adding more chemicals from a
holding tank will either decrease the amount of another chemical or increase the ﬂow rate in the pipe.
The attacker thus needs to develop a knowledge of all the side effects of manipulating the process.
The process is not designed for the attacker. Every part of the process has a normal range and a
possible range. Adjusting one part of the process for malicious purposes may have side effects on
other parts of the process. The control stage studies what each actuator does and what side effects
are possible. It may be possible to turn off a pump, but the side effect is that pressure builds up
quickly in an upstream pipe. Not every action can be taken at every level of the process. Instructing
a breaker to close while a line is charged may be prevented by an interlock. The attacker may need to
hack an embedded controller to override that interlock. The control stage also involves the study of
timings. If the damage occurs in seconds, a safety shutdown minutes later will not stop the attacker.
Some part of control can be studied statically, but other parts must be investigated dynamically
on the process (process reconnaissance). No diagram will every be detailed enough to accurately
predict the travel time of a disturbance down a pipe to the accuracy needed to set up a resonance
between two pumps. Since that data must be extracted from the live process, this is a great chance
for the defenders to notice the attackers.
3.4
Damage
Once the attacker understands the process and how to control it, she needs to decide how exactly
to achieve her goals. There may be several competing scenarios. The attacker will need to develop
some sort of measure (a metric) to choose between them. Bouncing some pumps off the ﬂoor until
they break may be a good idea, but the economic damage to the target plant may be far less than,
e.g., poisoning the catalyst in the reactor.
Physical damage to a process may not come to a process engineer’s mind ﬁrst. Engineers asked
to attack a process tend to come up with what is known as “salty cookie” scenarios. A group of
engineers asked to attack a cookie factory all hit on variations of putting too much salt in the cookies
14
Chapter 3. Stages of Cyber-Physical Attacks
so they would become uneatable. However, in a real world scenario the actual damage to the food
factory came from simultaneously creating too much product and disabling the emergency ﬂushing
system. The resulting clogged pipes had to be physically replaced after both water pressure and
chemical means of clearing them failed.
Accident data can be a good starting point when studying damage scenarios for a process. If a
particular type of process has gone wrong in the past by accident, it stands to reason that an attacker
may be able to make the process fail in a similar way by design.
While the access phase is the one most familiar to a traditional IT hacker, the damage phase is
the one least familiar. It often requires the input of subject matter experts to understand the full range
of possibilities.
3.5
Cleanup
In traditional IT hacking, a goal is to go undetected. In most process control scenarios, this is not an
option. If a piece of equipment is damaged or if a plant suddenly becomes less proﬁtable, someone
will be sent to investigate. An attack will change things in the real world that cannot be removed by
simply erasing the log ﬁles.
The cleanup phase is about creating a forensic footprint for investigators by manipulating the
process and the logs in such a way that the analyst draws the wrong conclusions. The goal is to get
the attack blamed on operator error or equipment failure instead of a cyber event.
An example of a cleanup phase would be to show the operator a process out-of-control, making
her take a particular action. When investigators ask the operator if she was manually manipulating
the process when it malfunctioned, she will answer in the afﬁrmative. Another example would be
damaging an actuator upstream of the attack to focus investigators towards a previous stage in the
process.
Synopsis
4. Vinyl Acetate Monomer Process
Vinyl acetate monomer is a large-scale commodity chemical and is an essential chemical building
block used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer products. VAC is a key ingredient in resins,
intermediates used in paints, adhesives, coatings, textiles packaging, automotive plastic fuel tanks
and many other ﬁnal products. Detailed information about the product including regulatory, health,
environmental, and physical hazard information can be found e.g. on the web page of The Dow
Chemical Company [55].
4.1
Process Description
In the VAC process, there are ten basic unit operations, which include a vaporizer, a catalytic plug
ﬂow reactor, a feed-efﬂuent heat exchanger (FEHE), a separator, a gas compressor, an absorber, a
carbon dioxide CO2 removal system, a gas removal system, a tank for the liquid recycle stream, and
an azeotropic distillation column with a decanter.
The route for vinyl acetate manufacturing used in the process model is the same as employed
in today’s manufacturing and involves seven chemical components. Ethylene C2H4, oxygen O2,
and acetic acid HAc are provided as both fresh and recycled feeds and are converted into the vinyl
acetate with water H2O and carbon dioxide CO2 as byproducts. The fresh C2H4 stream contains an
inert component C2H6. The following reactions take place in the reactor:
Main reaction: C2H4 +CH3COOH+ 1
2 O2 → CH2−−CHOCOCH3 +H2O,
Side reaction: C2H4 +3 O2 → 2 CO2 +2 H2O.
The reactor contains tubes packed with a catalyst. Both reactions are highly exothermic and
require tight control of the reactor cooling. The side reaction of ethylene combustion to CO2 is
highly undesirable as it lowers the conversion and complicates the removal of the reaction heat.
Details of the ethylene combustion kinetics in the synthesis of vinyl acetate are presented in [23]
The reactor efﬂuent is sent to the separator, where gas and liquid are separated. The vapor
from the separator goes to the compressor and the liquid stream becomes a part of the feed to the

distillation column. The gas from the compressor is recycled back to the reactor through the absorber
and the CO2 removal system. The liquid products, VAC and water, are withdrawn from the decanter.
Fig. 4.1 illustrates the process ﬂowsheet with the locations of contol valves.
Readers are referred to [39] and Chapter 10 in [14] for a detailed process description, including
the reaction rate expressions, steady state process data and the major aspects of each unit operation.
To protect the proprietary information of any speciﬁc VAC production facility, the kinetic data,
process ﬂowsheet information, equipment data and modeling formulation in the published process
came from the sources in the open literature (see [39] and references therein).
Safety constraints
Two key safety constraints exist in the process. Exceeding either of the safety limits will shut
down the process via interlocks:
• O2 concentration must not exceed 8 mol% anywhere in the gas recycle loop to remain outside
the explosivity envelope of ethylene. More on the limits of oxygen concentration in gas
mixtures can be found in [58].
• The pressure in the gas recycle loop and distillation column cannot exceed 965 kPa (140 psi)
because of the mechanical construction limit of the vessels.
Operating constraints
The process constraints must be maintained to ensure efﬁcient production without interruptions
for maintenance. They are speciﬁed as the following upper and lower bounds for some of the process
variables:
• The peak reactor temperature along the length of the tube must remain below 200◦C to prevent
4.2 Control Model
17
mechanical damage to the catalyst requiring shutdown and catalyst exchange.
• Liquid levels in the vaporizer, separator, absorber base, distillation column base, and decanter
must operate within the limits of 10-90%.
• Reactor inlet temperature and the hot side exit temperature form the heat exchanger must
remain above 130◦C to avoid condensation of liquid.
• Organic phase in the decanter must contain less than 600 mol/million of acetic acid to prevent
product contamination.
• The VAC composition in the bottoms stream must remain below 100 mol/million to prevent
polymerization and fouling in the reboiler and vaporizer.
In contrast to the TE test process, the VAC model is not accompanied with an objective operating
costs function for process control optimization. Instead, the economic objective was formulated as
balancing trade-offs in maximizing vinyl acetate production and recovery with minimizing carbon
dioxide productions and energy consumption.
4.2
Control Model
Similarly to the authors of TE process, Luyben and Tyreus proposed a set of control requirements but
did not suggest any process control scheme challenging the research community to come up with their
own control approaches, e.g. [40, 46, 14, 51]. The majority of the control design implementations
were kept proprietary due to high modeling costs. To make the process model available for a wider
range of users McAvoy et al. have developed a simulation model of VAC for Matlab [10] which we
use in our experimental work.
The process model includes 246 states, 26 manipulated variables XMV{1-26}, and 43 mea-
surements XMEAS {1-43}. Readers are referred to [10] for a complete description of process
model formulation, assumptions, and implementation. The process model utilizes a control structure
proposed in [40]. Fig. 4.1 depicts the location of control loops. The numbering of control loops
follows the numbering in Appendix 2 in [10]. Some manipulated variables are ﬁxed and therefore
their control loops are not shown.
4.3
Simulation of Attacks
In cyber-physical hacking the attacker aims to cause tangible impact on the process. In the context of
cyber-physical systems the attacker can either modify the control algorithm or tamper with controller
inputs and outputs. Input data ﬂow refers to the process data measured by sensors. These are con-
trolled variables (CV) and process measurements. Output data represent control ﬂow of manipulated
variables (MV) which update states of the actuators. Communication channels from sensors and to
actuators are susceptible to communication jamming (DoS) and data manipulation/injections attacks.
We extended the Simulink model to simulate integrity attacks and DoS attacks on the sensors and
manipulated variables (actuators). In this work we limited attacker’s capabilities to direct integrity
attacks on manipulated variables (e.g., change output buffers of the controller or inject packets). 1
Let Y(t) be a manipulated variable at time t, 0 ≤ t ≤ T, where T is the duration of the simulation;
time is discrete. The attack interval Ta is arbitrary and is limited to the simulation run time. In our
setting, we simulate the compromised manipulated variable Y ′ as follows:
1The attacker can manipulate state of the actuators also indirectly by forging sensor readings as we presented in [31].

Chapter 4. Vinyl Acetate Monomer Process
Y ′(t) =
Y(t),
for t /∈ Ta
Y a(t),
for t ∈ Ta,
where Y a(t) is the modiﬁed manipulated variable.
During a DoS attack on a controller signal freshly generated manipulated variables do not reach
the actuator. If Yj(t) is a manipulated variable for actuator j and the attack starts at time ta, we have:
Y a
j (t) = Yj(ta −1)
where Y a
t is stale manipulated variable (the last MV received from the controller before the DoS
attack).
In the context of Process Control Systems DoS attacks are similar to integrity attacks. The only
difference is in how the attack value is brought about: by choosing DoS approach the attacker has to
attack at a speciﬁc time (e.g. when a valve is all the way open or closed). The advantage of the DoS
attacks is that they can be used to manipulate the process even if control trafﬁc is authenticated and
integrity protected.
5. Attack for Production Damage
‘You can do unfocused and uncontrolled magic without a wand but to do really good spells, yes, you
need a wand.‘
-Joan Rowling on limits of magic in Harry Potter (2001)
An attacker with an objective beyond simple mayhem will want to reliably manipulate the
process and thus implement her attack in such a way that the process is still under control but in a
way she needs to accomplish her goals. In the context of cyber-physical systems the “focused magic”
is achieved with control theory methods.
Controllability and Observability
Controllability and observability represent two major concepts of modern control system
theory [16]. These concepts were introduced by R. Kalman in 1960.
Controllability: In order to be able to do whatever we want with the given dynamic system
under control input, the system must be controllable.
Observability: In order to see what is going on inside the system under observation, the
system must be observable.
Controllability is about whether one can design control input to steer the state to arbitrarily
values. Observability is concerned with whether without knowing the initial state, one can determine
the state of a system given the input and the output. Controllability and observability are dual aspects
of the same problem: the process must be observable in order to be controllable.
In this work we consider the scenario of economic damage to the plant. One way to inﬂuence
production costs is to make process inefﬁcient by inducing process disturbances and/or provoking
control loops instabilities to increase maintenance efforts. However, creating loop instabilities can
be a risky option as the attacker may loose control over the process herself. In the case of unskillful
manipulations, the process can even become completely uncontrollable. In contrast, targeting loop
effectiveness allows her to remain in control of the process and to adjust disruptive actions over time.
To persist with her malign assault, the attacker would want to attract attention from process
20
Chapter 5. Attack for Production Damage
operators as little as possible, e.g. by preventing alarms ﬂashing on the operators’ screens. Designing
an attack scenario is a matter of art as much as economic consideration. The cost of attack can
quickly exceed damage worth. Out of this consideration we decided to manipulate the process
without triggering alarms to save efforts on alarm suppression or process measurements spooﬁng. To
do so the attacker needs to see the status and alarms for the entire VAC process. One of the good
places could be a historian which are often mirrored in near real-time to the business network so that
