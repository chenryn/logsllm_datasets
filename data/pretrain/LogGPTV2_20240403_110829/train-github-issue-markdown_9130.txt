I apologize if this issue has already been reported.

Whenever I open a new window in Atom, I encounter the following error:
```
Failed to load /Users/me/.atom/init.coffee
Cannot read property 'eachEditorView' of undefined
```

**Details:**
- **Atom Version:** 0.206.0

Thank you for your assistance.
