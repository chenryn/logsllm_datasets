After I checkout SciPy and run the tests as-is, I'm seeing >50 test failures.
The steps being followed are:
    conda create -n scipy python=3
    conda install -y mkl numpy setuptools matplotlib cython pytest
    git clone https://github.com/scipy/scipy
    cd scipy
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    python runtests.py -v
I have also tried:
    apt-get install -yq build-essential ca-certificates gcc gfortran git python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install cython matplotlib mkl numpy pytest setuptools
    git clone https://github.com/scipy/scipy
    cd scipy
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    python runtests.py -v
These steps were followed in the continuumio/anaconda3 Docker image. I have
also had similar luck trying to do this on OSX. For what it's worth, the OSX
binaries from Conda output two failures when I run:
    python -c 'import scipy; scipy.test("full")'
What is the right way to build SciPy in a way that passes all tests?
