Abstract: Knowledge about business processes is one of the most important assets of a modern
organization. The knowledge about how an organization works, achieves its business goals,
satisfies its customers’ requirements and how agile the company is in these respects is essential
for its various stakeholders inside and outside of the organization. However success of process
management initiatives is highly dependent on the quality, completeness and expressiveness of
the knowledge acquired. This knowledge is distributed, consists of different types and
expresses different levels of abstraction. Its acquisition and collection into a common
knowledge base, which implies integration into a single model, is the goal of the approach
proposed. In this paper a framework for the integration of business process knowledge is
proposed. It is shown how semantic technologies can contribute to the integration of different
models, which represent different aspects of an organization, in order to create a better model
of business process knowledge.

1 Introduction
In the last few decades business process management has received a lot of attention in
the scientific as well as in the industrial world. Current market studies e.g. (Anderer
and Châlons 2006; Wolf and Harmon 2006) point out its importance for
organizations. On the other hand organizational practice and market analysis reports
still show a large gap between process descriptions (how an organization wants to
function) and their working practice (how organisation actually operate). In this paper
we address one of the key reasons for that problem: inappropriate process models.
The knowledge necessary for the modeling of better “to-be” models is heterogeneous,
and distributed among people, documentation and systems. The critical connections
or dependencies are not always obvious or defined. Beside isolation, parts of that
knowledge can be frequently also found outside the boundaries of organizations.
Often, essential parts of the relevant information about organization and business
processes necessary for the creation of the process models are not considered in the
design process. Dependencies between them are overlooked or misunderstood, and
key participants with significant knowledge and experiences are excluded from the
design process. Consequently, deficient understanding of the organization leads to the
creation of process descriptions and process models, which can not be followed and
carried out in the organizational practice.
On the other hand process models, even if they are feasible, are mostly designed for
only one stakeholder. They are therefore described in an inappropriate description
language, have inappropriate scope and form to be used for the proper communication
to different stakeholders on operational and on strategic level. Process models that
cannot take into account process stakeholders’ perspectives can hardly be expected to
be easily communicated and properly applied.
For the successful management of process knowledge (knowledge about the
organizational processes) it is necessary to treat it in a broader context (Hrastnik,
Cardoso et al. 2006). One of the possible solution for the generation of an integrated
and more expressive business process knowledge model that aggregates stakeholder’s
perspectives is to relay on semantic technologies.
Semantic technologies can extend capabilities and value of information. The four
main reasons that make semantic technologies suitable to approach the identified
problems are (Noy and McGuinness 2001): (1) to share a common understanding of
the structure of information among people or software (this way, the model can be
understood by humans and computers); (2) to enable reuse of already specified
domain knowledge; (3) to make domain assumptions explicit (concepts defined in the
model have a well-defined and unambiguous meaning); (4) analysis of domain
knowledge is possible once a declarative specification of the terms is available.
Models with richer semantic relationships and strict rules offer a more powerful and
flexible basis for knowledge integration, modeling and communication. Additional
benefits for combining of business process management with semantic technologies
can be find in (Hepp, Leymann et al. 2005).
In this paper we propose an extendable framework for business process knowledge
integration, which uses the advantages of semantic technology to enable a mapping
and integration of different models into a common knowledge base with the help of
an ontology. Those independent models are parts of business process knowledge and
present aspects, dimensions, or abstraction levels of an organization. Once integrated
in a new model, they provide a better basis for better business analysis and creation of
more suitable process models and improved process knowledge communication.
This paper is structured in the following way: the first part presents the challenges
regarding business process knowledge management. The problems regarding process
models and current approaches and solutions are discussed. In section 3 our
integration approach for achieving better process models is introduced. The
framework architectural design and technologies used are shown in section 4. In the
following section possible extensions for the introduced framework are presented.
The last section summarizes the paper and concludes with plans for future work.
2 Background and Motivation
There are various reasons why organizations model different aspects of their
organizations. Apart from analysis, process automation, simulation and
documentation, the creation of “guidelines” (for fulfilling the organization’s strategy,
goals, regulatory, compliance, quality standards and above all customer requirements)
is one of the most frequent reasons for modeling.
The knowledge necessary for the creation of process models must be collected at
several levels within and outside the organization; respecting its unique structure,
people and culture. In the modeling process, organizations are confronted with
different kinds of difficulties and constraints (Habermann 2001). Knowledge about
processes is distributed, heterogeneous, isolated, expresses at different level of
abstraction and scopes, and is often contradictory. Language barriers between people
with different professional backgrounds represent sometimes unbridgeable worlds.
Gaining critical and important information for process model creation is therefore a
complex, time-consuming task, which can be never complete.
Current enterprise and business modeling approaches, tools and modeling languages
which in specific contexts and different focuses address buisness process modeling
can only partialy fulfill important requirements regarding integration and
communication of business process knowledge. Established process modeling
languages (e.g. BPMN(OMG 2006), BPEL (BPEL 2007), UML (OMG 2005)) do not
cover all the important concepts or knowledge elements (Fadel and Tanniru 2005)
which critically contribute to the expressiveness of the process models. Because of
specific purposes and design objectives of modeling languages process models
created with them support only limited number of perspectives (Curtis, Kellner et al.
1992). Extensions to modeling languages have been proposed (e.g. process goals and
performance measures (Korherr and List 2007)). The enterprise modeling approaches
which usually include the process aspect do not offer methods for its integration with
the other aspects of the organization to be modeled. Zachman Framework (Zachman
1987)) offers the classification and propose modeling languages for different layers
only as examples and do not specify them in detail. Therefore the “bridges” between
different layers cannot be easily established. Also popular enterprise modeling tools
(e.g. Aris Process Platform (IDS-Scheer 2005) or ProVision Modeling Suite
(Proforma-Corporation 2007) do not integrate the various models or provide only
very loose connections between them (Hepp and Roman 2007). Some approaches
which offer comprehensive integration (e.g. MEMO (Frank 2002)) introduce new
modeling languages for perspectives and aspects of organization to be modeled.
3 Integration Approach
To enable a systematic approach, the business process knowledge framework was
proposed (Hrastnik, Rollett et al. 2004). It considers business process knowledge
(Hrastnik, Cardoso et al. 2006) as a super set of conventional business process models
and also includes knowledge about the motivation behind processes, reasons for their
existence, knowledge about constraints, the required resources for their execution, as
well as its interfaces, process environment, capability, performance and
documentation. The systematic approach includes the following management steps:
acquisition, synthesis, and communication. In this paper, as a part of the synthesis
step, we propose business process knowledge integration.
In our solution we propose a pragmatic procedure for achieving better process models
that do not require additional effort or changes to workflow within the organization.
The goal of building better business process models and knowledge can be achieved
iteratively by enriching the process models designed with information captured in
other knowledge sources already available in the organization. Different
organizational roles either at strategic or operational level design and model various
aspect of the organization, important for their part of work (e.g. strategy, people,
resources, data). In order not to require additional work, we use those specific models
in the form in which they usually already available (e.g. from standard business
software file formats). The specific models describe an aspect or a layer of the
organization or business (e.g. goals tree, value chains, organizational chart) at
different levels of abstraction or a specific view on it. They often include knowledge
which represents a relevant part of or constraints for the business process knowledge
model.

Figure 1: Models integration
In support of the creation of a common business process knowledge model, all
applicable knowledge captured in specific models is mapped in to a common
description language and integrated into a single model. How different knowledge
elements from specific models relate to each other and to the knowledge elements in
the knowledge base is defined by business process knowledge meta model, in our
case an ontology. In the integration process, for the knowledge base relevant
knowledge elements of the specific models are merged with the ones already
available in the knowledge base (e.g. business goals with process goals, process goals
with process models, process models with corresponding measurement categories and
