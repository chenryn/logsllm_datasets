**Abstract:**
Business process knowledge is a critical asset for modern organizations. Understanding how an organization operates, achieves its goals, meets customer requirements, and maintains agility is essential for various stakeholders. The success of process management initiatives heavily depends on the quality, completeness, and expressiveness of the acquired knowledge. This knowledge is often distributed, diverse, and abstract. The proposed approach aims to integrate this knowledge into a common knowledge base, creating a unified model. This paper presents a framework for integrating business process knowledge using semantic technologies. It demonstrates how these technologies can integrate different models representing various organizational aspects to create a more comprehensive and effective business process knowledge model.

### 1. Introduction

In recent decades, business process management (BPM) has gained significant attention in both academic and industrial circles. Market studies (Anderer and Châlons 2006; Wolf and Harmon 2006) highlight its importance for organizations. However, there remains a substantial gap between process descriptions (how an organization should function) and actual practices (how it functions). One key reason for this discrepancy is the inadequacy of process models.

The knowledge required for modeling better "to-be" processes is heterogeneous and distributed among people, documentation, and systems. Critical connections and dependencies are not always apparent or defined. Additionally, essential information about the organization and its processes, necessary for creating accurate process models, is often overlooked. Dependencies are frequently misunderstood, and key participants with valuable knowledge and experience are excluded from the design process. As a result, the lack of a comprehensive understanding leads to the creation of process descriptions and models that are impractical and unfeasible in real-world scenarios.

Moreover, even when feasible, process models are often designed for a single stakeholder, using inappropriate description languages and scopes. This makes them unsuitable for communication with other stakeholders at both operational and strategic levels. Models that fail to consider multiple perspectives are unlikely to be effectively communicated and applied.

To successfully manage process knowledge, it is essential to treat it in a broader context (Hrastnik, Cardoso et al. 2006). One potential solution is to use semantic technologies to generate an integrated and more expressive business process knowledge model that incorporates multiple stakeholders' perspectives.

Semantic technologies enhance the value and capabilities of information. Four main reasons make them suitable for addressing the identified problems (Noy and McGuinness 2001):
1. Sharing a common understanding of information structure among people and software.
2. Enabling the reuse of already specified domain knowledge.
3. Making domain assumptions explicit.
4. Facilitating the analysis of domain knowledge through declarative specifications.

Models with richer semantic relationships and strict rules provide a more powerful and flexible basis for knowledge integration, modeling, and communication. Additional benefits of combining BPM with semantic technologies are discussed in (Hepp, Leymann et al. 2005).

This paper proposes an extendable framework for business process knowledge integration, leveraging semantic technologies to map and integrate different models into a common knowledge base using an ontology. These independent models represent various aspects, dimensions, or abstraction levels of an organization. Once integrated, they provide a better foundation for business analysis, the creation of more suitable process models, and improved process knowledge communication.

### 2. Background and Motivation

Organizations model different aspects of their operations for various reasons, including analysis, process automation, simulation, and documentation. One of the most frequent reasons is to create guidelines that align with the organization's strategy, goals, regulatory compliance, quality standards, and customer requirements.

The knowledge needed to create process models must be gathered from multiple levels within and outside the organization, considering its unique structure, people, and culture. Organizations face numerous challenges during the modeling process (Habermann 2001). Process knowledge is distributed, heterogeneous, isolated, and often contradictory. Language barriers between professionals from different backgrounds can create insurmountable obstacles. Collecting critical and important information for process model creation is a complex and time-consuming task that can never be fully complete.

Current enterprise and business modeling approaches, tools, and languages address business process modeling in specific contexts but only partially fulfill the requirements for integration and communication of business process knowledge. Established process modeling languages (e.g., BPMN, BPEL, UML) do not cover all important concepts or knowledge elements (Fadel and Tanniru 2005), limiting the expressiveness of process models. Modeling languages designed for specific purposes support only a limited number of perspectives (Curtis, Kellner et al. 1992). Extensions have been proposed (e.g., process goals and performance measures by Korherr and List 2007), but enterprise modeling approaches that include the process aspect do not offer methods for integrating it with other organizational aspects.

Frameworks like the Zachman Framework (Zachman 1987) classify and suggest modeling languages for different layers but do not specify them in detail, making it difficult to establish connections between layers. Popular enterprise modeling tools (e.g., Aris Process Platform, ProVision Modeling Suite) do not integrate various models or provide only loose connections (Hepp and Roman 2007). Some comprehensive integration approaches (e.g., MEMO by Frank 2002) introduce new modeling languages for organizational perspectives and aspects.

### 3. Integration Approach

To address these challenges, we propose a systematic approach for business process knowledge integration. The framework considers business process knowledge as a superset of conventional business process models, including knowledge about the motivations behind processes, reasons for their existence, constraints, required resources, interfaces, process environment, capability, performance, and documentation (Hrastnik, Rollett et al. 2004; Hrastnik, Cardoso et al. 2006). The systematic approach includes the following steps: acquisition, synthesis, and communication. In this paper, we focus on the synthesis step, specifically on business process knowledge integration.

Our solution proposes a pragmatic procedure for improving process models without requiring additional effort or changes to the organization's workflow. Better business process models and knowledge can be achieved iteratively by enriching existing process models with information from other available knowledge sources within the organization. Different organizational roles, at both strategic and operational levels, design and model various aspects of the organization relevant to their work (e.g., strategy, people, resources, data). To avoid additional work, we use these models in their existing formats (e.g., standard business software file formats).

These specific models describe different aspects or layers of the organization (e.g., goal trees, value chains, organizational charts) at various levels of abstraction or from specific viewpoints. They often include knowledge that is a relevant part of or a constraint for the business process knowledge model.

**Figure 1: Models Integration**

In support of creating a common business process knowledge model, all applicable knowledge captured in specific models is mapped into a common description language and integrated into a single model. The relationships between different knowledge elements from specific models and those in the knowledge base are defined by a business process knowledge meta-model, which in our case is an ontology. During the integration process, relevant knowledge elements from specific models are merged with those already available in the knowledge base (e.g., business goals with process goals, process goals with process models, process models with corresponding measurement categories).
