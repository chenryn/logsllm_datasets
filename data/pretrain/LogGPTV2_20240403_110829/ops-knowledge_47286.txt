User: You need to optimize your company's internal network to reduce latency and improve bandwidth utilization. Please provide a detailed optimization plan, including network topology, link bandwidth, flow control, etc.
Assistant: 1. Network topology For the company's existing network topology, it is recommended to adopt a three-layer network architecture (Access layer, Distribution layer, Core layer) for improvement, which can improve the reliability and flexibility of the network while reducing delay. The recommended specific topology is as follows: Access layer: connects user equipment and completes the access function of user equipment. It is recommended to use a layer 3 switch and use VLAN technology to implement policy routing and flow control based on ports and MAC addresses. Distribution layer: connect multiple Access layers to realize centralized aggregation and distribution functions. It is recommended to use a three-layer switch, and perform routing separation and protocol filtering. Core layer: to realize the core functions of the network, it is recommended to use a high-performance layer-3 switch or router to provide high-speed data forwarding and routing calculation functions. 2. Link bandwidth For link bandwidth, the following measures are recommended for optimization: 1. Adopt Gigabit Ethernet technology to increase link bandwidth and realize high-speed data transmission. 2. Use port aggregation technology (Link Aggregation Control Protocol, LACP for short) to bind multiple physical links into logical links to increase link bandwidth. 3. Using Virtual LAN (VLAN for short) technology, the network is divided into multiple virtual LANs according to business or department to avoid broadcast storms and network congestion. 3. Flow control In order to ensure the smooth flow of network flow, the following measures are recommended for flow control: 1. Configure the switch port rate limit, and set different rate limits for different ports. 2. Use IP flow control technology to implement flow control for different IP addresses or IP address segments. 3. Use traffic classification and QoS technology to set different QoS policies for different applications or services to ensure the service quality of key businesses. 4. Configure security devices such as intrusion detection and firewalls to ensure network security and avoid network congestion caused by external attacks or internal malicious behaviors.
