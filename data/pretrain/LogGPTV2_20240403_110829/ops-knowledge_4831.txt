User:  How to use Git for version control, and implement code branch management and merging?
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system that helps programmers collaborate in developing and managing changes to code. The following are the steps to use Git for version control, branch management and merging: 1. Set up the Git environment: first, you need to install Git on the local computer. After the installation is complete, enter the "git --version" command in the terminal to check whether the installation is successful. 2. Initialize the warehouse: Select the folder where the code is stored in the computer, and use the terminal to enter the "git init" command in the folder to initialize the Git warehouse. 3. Add and commit files: To add files to track and commit, you can use the "git add" and "git commit" commands. Use the "git add" command to add files to be committed, and the "git commit" command to commit changes. 4. Create a branch: Use the "git branch" command to create a branch. For example, the "git branch dev" command creates a new branch called "dev". 5. Switch branches: Use the "git checkout" command to switch to the branch that needs to be modified. For example, the "git checkout dev" command switches the current branch to the "dev" branch. 6. Make changes on the branch: In the previous step, after switching to the "dev" branch, make changes or additions to the code. 7. Merge branches: Use the "git merge" command to merge branches. For example, the "git merge dev" command merges the current branch with the "dev" branch. 8. Resolve merge conflicts: Conflicts may arise when merging branches and need to be resolved manually. Use the "git status" command to view conflicting files, manually modify and save the conflicting files, use the "git add" command to add the modified file to the temporary storage area, and then use the "git commit" command to submit the modification. 9. Push to the remote warehouse: Use the "git push" command to push the modified code to the remote Git warehouse. The above are the basic steps of using Git for version control, branch management and merging, which can be modified and adjusted according to the actual situation.
