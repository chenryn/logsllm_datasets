Our Focus (1)
Supporting Web Processes on multi-enterprise and Web scale require
addressing heterogeneity/integration, scalability, dynamic change and
performance challenges
Semantics is seen as the key enabler to address these challenges;
Semantic Web Processes build upon Web Services and Semantic Web
technologies
This part of tutorial is about adding semantics to Web Services, and
exploiting them in Web Process Lifecycle (Specification, Discovery,
Composition, Execution)
Functional perspective takes form of process composition involving
Web Service Discovery, handling semantic heterogeneity [modeling
data i/o, state (pre/post condition) and function]
Operational perspective takes form of the research on QoS
Specification for Web Services and Processes [modeling QoS and
execution behavior]

Web Services: Definition
Web Services
“Web services are a new breed of Web application.
They are self-contained, self-describing, modular
applications that can be published, located, and
invoked across the Web. Web services perform
functions, which can be anything from simple requests
to complicated business processes. …
Once a Web service is deployed, other applications
(and other Web services) can discover and invoke the
deployed service.”

What are Web Processes (1)?
Web Processes
Web Processes are next generation workflow
technology to facilitate the interaction of
organizations with markets, competitors, suppliers,
customers etc. supporting enterprise-level and core
business activities
encompass the ideas of both intra and inter organizational
workflow.
created from the composition of Web services
can use BPEL4WS to represent composition, but how to get
there?

What are Web Processes ? (2)
Web Processes
Web processes describe how Web services are
connected to create reliable and dependable
business solutions
Web processes allow businesses to describe
sophisticated processes that can both consume
and provide Web services
The role of Web processes within the enterprise is
to simplify the integration of business and
application processes across technological and
corporate domains

BIG Challenges
Heterogeneity and Autonomy
Syntactic, semantic and pragmatic
Complex rules/regulations related to B2B and e-
commerce interactions
Solution: Machine processable descriptions
Dynamic nature of business interactions
Demands: Efficient Discovery, Composition, etc.
Scalability (Enterprises → Web)
Needs: Automated service discovery/selection and
composition
Proposition: Semantics is the most important
enabler to address these challenges.

When Web services and other descriptions that define a Web
process are semantically described, we may call such process as
Semantic Web Processes.
An ontology provides semantic grounding. It includes a
vocabulary of terms, and some specification of their
meaning.
The goal is to create an agreed-upon vocabulary and semantic
structure for exchanging information about that domain.

Approximately 95 000 different word forms
English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are
organized into synonym sets, each representing one
underlying lexical concept.
Different relations link the synonym sets.
Create a lexical thesaurus (not a dictionary) which
models the lexical organization used by humans.

have its own physical existence (living or nonliving))
94
95
Using WordNet
Sense 2
eagle -- ((in golf) a score of two strokes under par on a golf hole)
=> score -- (a number that expresses the accomplishment of a team or an
individual in a game or contest; "the score was 7 to 0")
=> number -- (a concept of quantity derived from zero and units; "every number
has a unique position in the sequence")
=> definite quantity -- (a specific measure of amount)
=> measure, quantity, amount, quantum -- (how much there is of
something that you can measure)
=> abstraction -- (a general concept formed by extracting common
features from specific examples)

Semantics for Web Processes
Data/Information Semantics
What: Formal definition of data in input and output messages of a web service
Why: for discovery and interoperability
How: by annotating input/output data of web services using ontologies
Functional/Operational Semantics
Formally representing capabilities of web service
for discovery and composition of Web Services
by annotating operations of Web Services as well as provide preconditions and effects; Annotating
TPA/SLA (future work)
Execution Semantics
Formally representing the execution or flow of a services in a process or operations in a service
for analysis (verification), validation (simulation) and execution (exception handling) of the process
models
using State Machines, Petri nets, activity diagrams etc.
QoS Semantics
Formally describing operational metrics of a web service/process
To select the most suitable service to carry out an activity in a process
using QoS model [Cardoso and Sheth, 2002] for web services

Semantics at Different Layers
Description Layer:
Why:
Flow
• Unambiguously understand the functionality of the services
and the semantics of the operational data
Discovery
How:
• Using Ontologies to semantically annotate WSDL
Publication
constructs (conforming to extensibility allowed in WSDL
specification version 1.2/2.0)
– WSDL-S : Incorporate all types of semantics in the service
Description

Messaging
Present scenario:
• WSDL descriptions are mainly syntactic (provides
Network
operational information and not functional information)
• Semantic matchmaking is not possible

(contd..)
Publication and Discovery Layers:
Why:
Flow • Enable scalable, efficient and dynamic publication and
discovery (machine processable / automation)
Discovery
How:
• Use of ontology to categorize registries based on domains
Publication
and characterize them by maintaining the
1. properties of each registry
2. relationships between the registries
Description
• Capturing the WSDL annotations in UDDI
Messaging
Present scenario:
• Suitable for simple searches ( like services offered by a
Network
provider, services that implement an interface, services that
have a common technical fingerprint etc.)
• Categories are too broad
• Automated service discovery (based on functionality) and
108
selecting the best suited service is not possible
