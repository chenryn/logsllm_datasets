##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
include_role
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.1.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY / STEPS TO REPRODUCE
When I include a role from another role, the include statement of the included
role is not able to find the file. For example:
Role A includes role B
    - name: Include other role
      include_role:
        name: roleB
and role B is split into multiple task files:
    - name: Install
      include: install.yml
    - name: Configure
      include: configure.yml
When role B is directly used from a play everything works fine, but using it
from task A failed with ' _file not found errors_ '.
I have been able to 'fix' this issue by using the `role_path` variable:
    - name: Install
      include: "{{ role_path }}/tasks/install.yml"
    - name: Configure
      include: "{{ role_path }}/tasks/configure.yml"
