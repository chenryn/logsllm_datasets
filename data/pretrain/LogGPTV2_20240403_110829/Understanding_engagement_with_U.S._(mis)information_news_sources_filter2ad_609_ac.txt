that certain news publishers do not engage well with their audi-
ences overall; it only means that many individual posts fail to find
an audience (320 k posts, or roughly 4.3 % have no engagement).
We note that all content annotation for factualness is done at the
source level. While there is a high likelihood that most posts from
a news source follow its general style, tone, and attitude towards
factualness and political leaning, there is no guarantee that this
holds true in each single instance. This limitation may introduce a
level of noise into our results.
We do not normalize post engagement because we have no reli-
able estimate for the audience size. Most posts are likely shown to
a subset of the corresponding page’s followers, but once content
becomes viral, Facebook may also show it to non-followers in the
“Suggested For You” box [9]; in this case, per-follower normalization
would introduce a bias. Additionally, follower-normalized per-post
engagement becomes even more unstable than the normalized per-
page audience engagement metric from Figure 5 because there is
no aggregation at all, thus we avoid normalization here.
At the level of individual posts, those from misinformation
sources tend to receive more engagement than those from non-
misinformation sources. Of our data set of over 7.5 M posts, 446 k

Identical range on the x axes vertically, and on the y axes

4.3 Post Engagement
To quantify the engagement advantage (or disadvantage) of individ-
ual pieces of content from (mis)information pages, we now study
posts independently from their pages. This metric is better suited to
study viral content with extremely high engagement because such
posts appear as individual data points in the distribution, and their
influence on the overall distribution can be reduced or assessed by
considering median post engagement or comparing it to the mean.
This metric also models low-engagement posts that “disappear” in
the summed engagement of the per-page audience engagement or
the ecosystem-wide total engagement metrics. As this metric is
deliberately independent from individual publishers, a large share
of low-engagement posts, for instance, does not necessarily imply

comments and shares. In the means, absolute increases in engage-
ment are even higher, but not always in relative terms.
Table 6 shows median and mean engagement numbers for var-
ious types of posts. (Table 11 in the appendix further breaks this
down into interaction types.) Photo posts and various types of
video posts tend to have the highest increases in engagement when
comparing non-misinformation to misinformation sources. Live
video posts from misinformation pages perform exceptionally well
on the Far Right, with 6.47 k additional interactions in the median,
or 18.5 k in the mean, when compared to a post from a Far Right
non-misinformation source.

are from misinformation sources. Those posts have a mean engage-
ment of 4,670 interactions, compared to a mean of 765 interactions
for non-misinformation sources. Even when breaking down posts
by the political leaning of their source, as shown in the box plot
in Figure 7, those from a misinformation page have a consistent
advantage in engagement, both in the median and the mean (except
for Slightly Left, where the mean engagement with posts from mis-
information sources is slightly lower). This advantage can be very
large in absolute terms. In the Far Left, the misinformation median
is over an order of magnitude larger than the non-misinformation
median and is outperforming even the non-misinformation mean.
The misinformation to non-misinformation difference between the
medians is similarly large for Slightly Right. The median misinfor-
mation advantage is lowest for the Far Right. (Median and mean
values can also be found at the bottom of Table 5.)
Using a Multivariate ANOVA with partisanship and factualness
as the independent variables and their interaction on the natural log-
transformed distribution of per-post engagement as the dependent
variable, we found that the impact of factualness on mean engage-
ment was significant across all political leanings at the 0.05 level
(Table 4). Post-hoc testing confirmed the significance of factualness
in explaining differences in mean engagement for all partisanships.
When looking at the types of interactions in Table 5, reactions
are by far the most common type of engagement. In the median,
posts from misinformation sources have higher engagement across
all interaction types. As the most extreme example, a median post
from Far Left non-misinformation pages garners 101 reactions,
whereas a median post from a Far Left misinformation page gen-
erates 1.5 k additional reactions. This may be due in part to dif-
ferent follower bases, as shown in Figure 4. But even for the Far
Right, where follower bases are more similar for misinformation
and non-misinformation pages, a median post from misinforma-
tion pages generates 77 % more reactions than a median post from
non-misinformation sources, and has almost twice the numbers of

4.4 Video
When studying misinformation news on Facebook, ideally we
would like to assess how often such posts are shown to users. Post
impression data, however, is not available on CrowdTangle. Video
views are the closest available metric, but different in various re-
gards. Views are not impressions because they require a minimum
amount of activity (i.e., watching for at least three seconds). Fur-
thermore, views are available only for video posts, which account
for 5.1 % to 19.4 % of all posts per political leaning, and video posting
patterns differ across publishers. We collected a separate data set
of video views as described in Section 3.3.1. It covers a subset of
the video posts from the remainder of the paper and was collected
at a different time, thus we only compare trends.
We begin by looking at total views of videos from (mis)infor-
mation sources across the Facebook news ecosystem, computed
similar to total engagement in Section 4.1. At a high level, view
trends are in line with all-post-type engagement. Views of videos
from non-misinformation sources significantly outnumber views
from misinformation sources across the political spectrum from
the Far Left to Slightly Right. Videos from Far Right misinforma-
tion sources, however, collect 3.4 times more views in total than
those from non-misinformation sources. As Figure 8 shows, the
proportions across different political leanings do not match total
engagement with all post types (Figure 2); for example, despite
their larger number, videos from Slightly Left non-misinformation
sources generate only around 54 % of views from Far Left non-
misinformation sources. (Engagement with all types of content
from Slightly Left non-misinformation sources was 1.6 times the
total engagement from Far Left non-misinformation sources.) We
also note that Slightly Left misinformation providers posted only
337 videos over the course of our study period, which means that
the data does not permit us to assess any advantage or disadvantage
of misinformation among Slightly Left video.
Figure 9a shows the distribution of views for individual videos
across the political and (mis)information spectrum according to
their publisher, similar to post engagement in Section 4.3. On a
per-video basis, the median number of views from misinformation
sources exceeds those from non-misinformation sources for all po-
litical leanings (except for slightly left, which may not be significant
due to the low number of videos). The means confirm higher views
from Center, Slightly Right and Far Right misinformation sources.
For the Far Left, the mean indicates fewer views of videos from mis-
information sources (whereas the median indicated more). Fitting

and in alternating rows the difference for posts from misinformation pages (delta relative to non-misinformation). Values do
not add up to the overall aggregate because computations are done independently. A median post from Far Left misinformation
pages receives 1.5 k more reactions than the non-misinformation counterpart. Due to outliers, the means can be much higher.
