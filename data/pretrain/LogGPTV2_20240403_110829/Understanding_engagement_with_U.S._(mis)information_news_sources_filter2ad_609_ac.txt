### Statistical Analysis and Engagement Metrics

**Statistical Significance:**
- \( t (262) = 7.10, p < 0.01 \)
- \( t (374k) = -15.2, p < 0.01 \)
- \( t (29.2k) = 30.1, p < 0.01 \)
- \( t (29.2k) = 4.60, p < 0.01 \)

**Table 4: Multivariate ANOVA Test Results for the Interaction of Partisanship and Factualness in Four Metrics (Using Natural Log Transform)**
- The interaction was significant at the 0.05 level for all metrics except for Slightly Left in the per-page, per-follower metric.

**Figure 6: Box Plot of Posts per Page, from Far Left to Far Right**
- White lines represent the medians, and "+" symbols represent the means.
- Some outliers up to 62k are not shown.
- Misinformation pages on the Far Left, Slightly Right, and Far Right tend to post more than their respective non-misinformation pages.

**Audience Engagement and Content Annotation:**
- The lack of engagement for certain news publishers does not indicate a general disengagement; rather, it suggests that many individual posts fail to find an audience (320k posts, or roughly 4.3%, have no engagement).
- Content annotation for factualness is done at the source level. While most posts from a news source likely follow its general style, tone, and attitude towards factualness and political leaning, there is no guarantee that this holds true in every instance. This limitation may introduce noise into our results.

**Normalization of Post Engagement:**
- We do not normalize post engagement due to the lack of a reliable estimate for the audience size. Most posts are likely shown to a subset of the corresponding page’s followers, but viral content may also be shown to non-followers via Facebook's “Suggested For You” box. Normalization by followers could introduce bias, especially for highly engaging content with a large follower base.

**Individual Post Engagement:**
- Posts from misinformation sources tend to receive more engagement than those from non-misinformation sources. In our dataset of over 7.5M posts, 446k posts are from misinformation sources, with a mean engagement of 4,670 interactions compared to 765 interactions for non-misinformation sources.
- Figure 7 shows a box plot of engagement per post, with partisanship and factualness derived from the publisher (log scale). Across the political spectrum, median posts from misinformation pages consistently outperform those from non-misinformation pages, both in the median and the mean (except for Slightly Left, where the mean engagement is slightly lower).

**Multivariate ANOVA Analysis:**
- Using a Multivariate ANOVA with partisanship and factualness as independent variables, we found that the impact of factualness on mean engagement was significant across all political leanings at the 0.05 level (Table 4). Post-hoc testing confirmed the significance of factualness in explaining differences in mean engagement for all partisanships.

**Types of Interactions:**
- Reactions are the most common type of engagement. In the median, posts from misinformation sources have higher engagement across all interaction types. For example, a median post from Far Left non-misinformation pages garners 101 reactions, while a median post from a Far Left misinformation page generates 1.5k additional reactions.

**Video Views:**
- Video views are the closest available metric to post impressions, requiring a minimum of three seconds of viewing. Videos account for 5.1% to 19.4% of all posts per political leaning, and video posting patterns differ across publishers.
- Total views of videos from non-misinformation sources significantly outnumber those from misinformation sources across the political spectrum, except for the Far Right, where misinformation sources collect 3.4 times more views.
- Figure 8 shows the proportions of video views across different political leanings, which do not match total engagement with all post types. For example, despite their larger number, videos from Slightly Left non-misinformation sources generate only around 54% of views from Far Left non-misinformation sources.

**Distribution of Views for Individual Videos:**
- On a per-video basis, the median number of views from misinformation sources exceeds those from non-misinformation sources for all political leanings (except for Slightly Left, which may not be significant due to the low number of videos).
- The means confirm higher views from Center, Slightly Right, and Far Right misinformation sources. For the Far Left, the mean indicates fewer views of videos from misinformation sources, whereas the median indicated more.

**Conclusion:**
- Our analysis shows that misinformation sources generally have a consistent advantage in engagement across various metrics, including posts and video views, with some variations based on political leaning. These findings highlight the need for further research to understand the mechanisms behind the engagement advantage of misinformation sources.
