User: I've spent days of research over the seemingly simple question: is it possible to run C code in a browser at all? Basically, I have a site set up in Appengine that needs to run some C code supplied by (a group of trusted) users and run it, and return the output of the code back to the user. I have two options from here: I either need to completely run the code in the browser, or find some way to have Python run this C code without any system calls.
I've seen mixed responses to my question. I've seen solutions like Emscripten, but that doesn't work because I need the LLVM code to be produced in the browser (I cannot run compilers in AppEngine.) I've tried various techniques, including scraping from the output page on codepad.org, but the output I will produce is so high that I cannot use services like codepad.org because they trim the output (my output will be ~20,000 lines of about 60 characters each, which is trimmed by codepad due to a timeout). My last resort is to make my own server that can serve my requests from my Appengine site, but that seems a little extreme.
The code supplied by my users will be very simple C. There are no I/O or system operations called by their code. Unfortunately, I probably cannot simply use a find/replace operation in their code to translate it to Javascript, because they may use structures like multidimensional arrays or maybe even classes.
I'm fine with limiting my users to one cross-platform browser, e.g. Chrome or Firefox. Can anyone help me find a solution to this question? I've been baffled for days.
Assistant: Old question but for those that land in here in 2018 it would be worth looking at Web Assembly.
