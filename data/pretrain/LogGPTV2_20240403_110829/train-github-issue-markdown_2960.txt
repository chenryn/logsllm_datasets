I think it would be a really-really good idea to move
_org.springframework.batch.retry_ into _org.springframework.core.retry_. It is
really well-thought out and useful API, a true gem. I can't believe I haven't
noticed it in all these years of using Spring. The API contain no conceptual
dependencies on batch infrastructure and they should really be moved into the
core.
