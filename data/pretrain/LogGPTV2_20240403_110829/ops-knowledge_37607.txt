User: How to implement high-availability MySQL database architecture and ensure data consistency?
Assistant: The following aspects need to be considered to realize the high-availability MySQL database architecture: 1. Multi-node master-slave replication: realize data backup and read-write separation through multi-node master-slave replication (Master-Slave Replication), and improve the availability of the system. 2. Load balancing: use Load Balancer to balance the load of multiple MySQL servers to handle high concurrent requests. 3. Data synchronization: Multiple MySQL servers need to maintain data synchronization, which can be achieved by using asynchronous replication or semi-synchronous replication. 4. Hot backup: Realize real-time backup of MySQL database to ensure data security and availability. 5. Automatic failover: When a MySQL node fails, automatic failover (Automatic Failover) is required to achieve seamless switching. At the same time, in order to ensure data consistency, the following measures need to be taken: 1. Set the correct replication mode: According to specific business and application scenarios, you can choose asynchronous or semi-synchronous replication mode to ensure data synchronization and consistency. 2. Monitor the replication status: check the replication status regularly, discover and deal with abnormalities such as data inconsistency in a timely manner. 3. Avoid changing the table structure: During the replication process, avoid changing the table structure and try to keep the structure consistent between MySQL nodes. 4. Ensure data security: Reasonably select backup schemes and backup strategies to ensure the security and reliability of data backup.
