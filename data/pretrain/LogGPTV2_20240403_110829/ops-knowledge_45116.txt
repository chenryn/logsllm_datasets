User: I am thinking of a good way to ship my application which is a python package. Installing my package is easy making use of pythons distutils package. 
The trouble comes with the dependencies my package relies on. If the dependencies are python packages I can deal with them easily again using distutils, but non python packages? Some of them even need a lot of care while building and installing them since very special compiler flags need to be set and so forth...
If I want to automate the installation procedure for the user what is the best way to go about it?

Writing a make file that downloads and installs the dependencies
Write a script that installs the dependencies
No automation is best. simply write a manual that tells the user how to install the 
dependencies
???

Thx in advance for any answer or suggestion
Assistant: The most important thing to help you decide is to consider your audience.  
Are they technically-inclined and likely to be comfortable following instructions specifying how to build the dependencies themselves?  If so, go with (3).  If not, writing a python or shell script, or a makefile to automate the task may be the way to go.  Pick whichever you feel most comfortable writing.
