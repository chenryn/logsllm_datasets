### Figure 16: Performance of Our Proposed Temporal Filtering Method

**Figure 16** illustrates the performance of our proposed temporal filtering method compared to time-based models. The figure shows the prediction accuracy ratio for both the original similarity metrics (labeled as "Basic") and those enhanced with Moving Average (MA, labeled as "Time Model"), with and without our filtering method.

- **Facebook:**
  - Time Model w/ filter: 24000
  - Basic w/ filter: 18000
  - Time Model w/o filter: 12000
  - Basic w/o filter: 6000
  - Baseline: 0

- **YouTube:**
  - Time Model w/ filter: 8000
  - Basic w/ filter: 6000
  - Time Model w/o filter: 4000
  - Basic w/o filter: 2000
  - Baseline: 0

- **Renren:**
  - Time Model w/ filter: 6000
  - Basic w/ filter: 4500
  - Time Model w/o filter: 3000
  - Basic w/o filter: 1500
  - Baseline: 0

### Observations and Analysis

Our observations indicate that the Moving Average (MA) consistently outperforms Linear Regression (LR), and thus we omit the LR results for brevity. Similar to Section 6.2, we present the results for the large instance for each network in Table 6 and ignore the similar results from the smaller instance.

**Key Findings:**
- For each metric, our filtering method consistently improves the accuracy more than the time series-based prediction, especially for Renren and Facebook.
- Even after applying the time series-based prediction, our filter can still significantly improve prediction accuracy.

### Summary

By leveraging temporal information on network dynamics, we can effectively improve link prediction accuracy. Using these temporal filters, we can prune the set of candidate node pairs for edge creation, allowing link prediction algorithms to focus on regions of likely growth. By comparing to other temporal methods, we further confirm the effectiveness and generality of our filtering method.

### Related Work

We conduct an in-depth study on two types of link prediction algorithms: metric-based and classification-based. Prior works have evaluated metric-based algorithms using co-author networks [23], classification-based methods using balanced data [3, 11], and both methods using a small subset of Twitter (155K nodes) [7]. Our work differs by studying both methods using datasets of large, dynamic online social networks that recently became available. By discretizing these datasets into numerous temporal snapshots, we study the evolution of link prediction over fine time intervals, identify potential factors behind prediction errors, and propose filters that improve prediction power for all algorithms.

Recent studies have leveraged temporal information for link prediction. The key approach is to extend existing algorithms in the temporal domain, e.g., adding a temporal dimension [1], assigning more weights to new links [37, 40], and integrating graph structure information over time [10]. Another approach applies past observations for prediction [8, 36] by identifying subgraphs that are similar to the target subgraph and using their time-evolving behaviors to help predict the target. However, each of these methods suffers from at least one of the following limitations:
- High complexity and inability to scale to large networks.
- Limited to a single model/metric, whose performance varies significantly across networks.
- Failure to capture and leverage temporal patterns of the network.

In contrast, our approach not only provides a general and scalable link prediction solution that supports a wide variety of similarity metrics, classifiers, and network graphs but also utilizes insights of network evolution to boost prediction accuracy and reduce complexity.

Finally, our work targets link prediction that only requires graph topology information, i.e., nodes and edges. Additional information, such as edge weights [27], node connections on other social networks [31], and link direction [43], can improve prediction performance. We plan to consider these factors in future work.

### Conclusions and Discussion

Using real traces of large dynamic networks, our work takes a concrete step towards objectively quantifying the predictive power of today’s link prediction algorithms. By implementing a wide range of algorithms, we have identified concrete challenges and issues with multiple algorithms, from high computational complexity that limits scalability to binary classification results that lack granularity.

For metric-based approaches, we have shown the futility of some metrics (e.g., shortest path) and validated the scalability of others, such as scalable Katz heuristics [38]. We have also shown that it is possible to scale some classifiers to large, multi-million node networks, and that classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can produce consistently strong results.

Surprisingly, we find that the best metric-based predictors (which vary across different networks) perform on par with the most accurate classifier (SVM in all cases). We derive potential guidelines for choosing metrics based on network structure. We also take a deeper look at current link prediction algorithms to understand the sources of low accuracy in both structural and temporal aspects. Furthermore, we provide “temporal filters” that can greatly improve prediction accuracy (across different methods and networks) by leveraging knowledge of prior network dynamics, even for predictors that have already integrated temporal information.

Finally, our results underscore the fact that current prediction algorithms still perform poorly at the fine granularity of individual link predictions, even with our proposed temporal filters. While this confirms that link prediction remains an unsolved problem, it is important to calibrate expectations depending on specific applications. For example, while current algorithms focus primarily on predicting nearby neighbors, a significant number of new links connect “distant” nodes. Overcoming these empirical limitations requires a better understanding of underlying network structures and dynamics.

This work only scratches the surface of a much larger problem space. Using datasets from just three networks, we already observe significant variance in accuracy for single metrics across different networks. Much more experimental and analytical work is necessary before we can identify specific properties of each network that make them more or less predictable by certain metrics. Our evaluation is limited by our reliance on network structural data, whereas deployed link prediction systems are likely to combine multiple information sources [14], such as user profiles and behavioral data, which can boost prediction accuracy empirically.
