Gt and Gt−1). We observe that MA consistently outper-
forms LR, and thus omit the LR result for brevity.
Similar to Section 6.2, we also present the result for the
large instance for each network in Table 6 and ignore the
similar results from the smaller instance. Figure 16 shows
prediction accuracy ratio for original similarity metrics (marked
as Basic) and those enhanced with MA (marked as Time
Model), both with and without our ﬁltering method. For
each metric, our ﬁltering consistently improves the accuracy
far more than the time series based prediction, especially for
Renren and Facebook. Furthermore, even after applying the
time series based prediction, our ﬁlter can still consistently
improve prediction accuracy.
We show that by leveraging temporal in-

formation on network dynamics, we can effectively improve
link prediction accuracy. Using these temporal ﬁlters, we
can prune the set of candidate node pairs for edge creation,
allowing link prediction algorithms to focus on regions of
likely growth. By comparing to other temporal methods, we
further conﬁrm the effectiveness and generality of our ﬁlter-
ing method.
7. RELATED WORK
We perform an in-depth study on two types of link pre-
diction algorithms (metric- and classiﬁcation-based). Prior
works have evaluated metric-based algorithms using co-author
networks [23], classiﬁcation-based methods using balanced
data [3, 11], and both methods using a small subset of Twit-
ter (155K nodes) [7]. Our work differs by studying both
methods using datasets of large, dynamic online social net-
works that recently became available. By discretizing these
datasets into numerous temporal snapshots, we study the
evolution of link prediction over ﬁne time intervals, iden-
tify potential factors behind prediction errors, and propose
ﬁlters that improve prediction power for all algorithms.
Recent studies have leveraged temporal information for
link prediction. The key approach is to extend existing al-
gorithms in the temporal domain, e.g. adding a temporal di-
mension [1], assigning more weights to new links [37, 40],
integrating graph structure information over time [10]. An-
other approach applies past observations for prediction [8,
36], by identifying subgraphs that are similar to the target
subgraph and use their time-evolving behaviors to help pre-
dict the target. Unfortunately, each of these methods suffers
from at least one of the following limitations: i) the method
is of high complexity and cannot scale to large networks; ii)
the method is limited to a single model/metric, whose perfor-
mance varies signiﬁcantly across networks; iii) the method
does not capture (and leverage) temporal patterns of the net-
work. In contrast, our approach not only provides a general
and scalable link prediction solution that supports a wide va-
riety of similarity metrics, classiﬁers and network graphs,
but also utilizes insights of network evolution to boost pre-
diction accuracy and reduce complexity.
Finally, our work targets link prediction that only require
graph topology information, i.e. nodes and edges. Addi-
tional information, such as edge weights [27], node connec-
tions on other social networks [31], and link direction [43],
can improve prediction performance. We plan to consider
these factors in future work.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
Using real traces of large dynamic networks, our work
takes a concrete step towards objectively quantifying the pre-
dictive power of today’s link prediction algorithms. By im-
plementing a wide range of algorithms, we have already iden-
tiﬁed concrete challenges and issues with multiple algorithms,
from high computational complexity that limits scalability,
to binary classiﬁcation results that lack granularity.
For metric-based approaches, we have shown the futility
of some metrics (shortest path) and validated the scalability
of others, e.g. scalable Katz heuristics [38]. At the same
time, we have shown that it is indeed possible to scale some
classiﬁers to large, multi-million node networks, and that
classiﬁers such as SVMs can produce consistently strong re-
sults.
More surprisingly, we ﬁnd that the best metric-based pre-
dictors (vary across different networks) perform on par with
the most accurate classiﬁer (SVM in all cases), and we de-
rive potential guidelines for choosing metrics based on net-
work structure. We also take a deeper look at current link
prediction algorithms for the source of low accuracy, in terms
of both structural and temporal aspects. Furthermore, we
provide “temporal ﬁlters” that can greatly improve predic-
tion accuracy (across different methods and networks) by
leveraging knowledge of prior network dynamics, even for
predictors that have already integrated temporal information.
Finally, our results underscore the fact that current predic-
tion algorithms still perform poorly at the ﬁne granularity of
individual link predictions, even with our proposed tempo-
ral ﬁlters. While this conﬁrms link prediction is still an un-
solved problem, it is important to calibrate expectations de-
pending on speciﬁc applications. For example, while current
algorithms focus primarily on predicting nearby neighbors,
a signiﬁcant number of new links connect “distant” nodes.
Overcoming these empirical limitations requires a better un-
derstanding of underlying network structures and dynamics.
This work only scratches the surface of a much larger
problem space. Using datasets from just three networks, we
already observe signiﬁcant variance in accuracy for single
metrics across different networks. Much more experimental
and analytical work is necessary before we can identify spe-
ciﬁc properties of each network that make them more or less
predictable by certain metrics. Our evaluation is limited by
our reliance on network structural data, whereas deployed
link prediction systems are likely to combine multiple infor-
mation sources [14], e.g., user proﬁles and behavioral data,
which can boost prediction accuracy empirically.
