User: Hi have been scavenging the web for answers on how to do this but there was no direct answer. Does anyone know how I can find the version number of tkinter?
Assistant: Type this command on the Terminal and run it.

python -m tkinter

A small window will appear with the heading tk and two buttons: Click Me! and QUIT. There will be a text that goes like This is Tcl/Tk version ___. The version number will be displayed in the place of the underscores.
