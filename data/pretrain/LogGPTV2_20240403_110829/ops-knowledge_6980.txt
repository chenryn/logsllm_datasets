**User:**
I have been searching the web for a solution, but I haven't found a direct answer. Can anyone help me find the version number of Tkinter?

**Assistant:**
To determine the version number of Tkinter, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Enter the following command and press Enter:
   ```sh
   python -m tkinter
   ```

A small window will appear with the title "tk" and two buttons: "Click Me!" and "QUIT." In this window, you will see a line of text that reads, "This is Tcl/Tk version ___." The underscores will be replaced by the actual version number of Tcl/Tk, which is the underlying toolkit used by Tkinter.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the version number of Tkinter installed on your system.
