ABSTRACT
The 6th Workshop on Encrypted Computing and Applied Homo-
morphic Cryptography is held in Toronto, ON, Canada on October
19th, 2018, co-located with the ACM Conference on Computer and
Communications Security (CCS). The workshop aims to bring to-
gether professionals, researchers and practitioners from academia,
industry and government in the area of computer security and
applied cryptography with an interest in practical applications of
homomorphic encryption, encrypted computing, functional encryp-
tion and secure function evaluation, private information retrieval
and searchable encryption. The workshop will feature 6 exciting
talks on different aspects of secure computation and a forum to
discuss current and future challenges.

1 INTRODUCTION
In a world where distance is no longer an obstacle for cooperation,
secure computation is becoming a key feature of current and fu-
ture information systems. Distributed network applications and
cloud architectures are at danger because lots of personal consumer
data is aggregated in all kinds of formats and for various purposes.
Industry and consumer electronics companies are facing massive
threats like theft of intellectual property and industrial espionage.
Public infrastructure has to be secured against sabotage and manip-
ulation. A possible solution is encrypted computing: Data can be
processed on remote, possibly insecure resources, while program
code and data is encrypted all the time. This allows to outsource
the computation of confidential information independently from
the trustworthiness or the security level of the remote system.

2 SCOPE AND TOPICS OF INTEREST
The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers with
practitioners, industry and government to present, discuss and to
share the latest progress in the field. We want to exchange ideas
that address real-world problems with practical approaches and so-
lutions. The workshop is typically uniformly attended by academia,
government, and industry, with attendees both from prior years
with experience in the domain and new attendees learning from the
community. Specific encrypted computing technologies focus on
homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation but
also need to interoperate with existing technologies and infrastruc-
tures. The technologies and techniques discussed in this workshop
are key to extending the range of applications that can be securely
and practically outsourced.
The topics include software architectures for encrypted applica-
tions, platform and system integration for encrypted applications,
algorithmic primitives for encrypted applications, hybrid (partly en-
crypted) applications, hardware implementations of encrypted com-
puting, implementation of homomorphic encryption schemes, prac-
tical performance evaluations of homomorphic encryption schemes,
practical aspects of functional encryption, privacy-preserving set
operations, secure information sharing, circuit transformation of
algorithms, obfuscation techniques, encrypted search schemes, en-
crypted e-payment solutions, encrypted financial transactions, en-
crypted applications in bio-informatics.
3 ORGANIZATION AND PROGRAM
The 2018 Workshop on Encrypted Computing and Applied Homo-
morphic Cryptography is the sixth edition of a series that started
in 2013. From the start, some of the most renowned researchers in
the field served in the program committee. The workshop featured
keynote-speakers like Vinod Vaikuntanathan (MIT), Seny Kamara
(MSR), Drew Dean (SRI), Dov Gordon (ACS), Erman Ayday (Bilkent),
Kim Laine (MSR) and Juriy Polyakov (NJIT).

3.4 3rd HomomorphicEncryption.org
Standards Meeting
Based on the success of two previous standards meetings, and the
founding of the HomomorphicEncryption.org industry consortium,
the Third Standardization Workshop will be held at the University
of Toronto, on October 20, 2018. The Standards Meeting is closely
related to WAHC but has its own program. The third meeting will
focus a standard API for homomorphic encryption.
