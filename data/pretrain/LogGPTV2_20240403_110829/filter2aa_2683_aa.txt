INTRODUCTION 
For this workshop, we’ll be using a lab that consist of five virtual machines joined to the same virtual network. 
Three of these virtual machines will run Windows and will be joined to one another using Active Directory. One of 
the three Windows machines will serve as the Domain Controller, and the other two will act as workstations. The 
remaining two virtual machines include a PFSense instance that will serve as a firewall between our lab and the 
outside world, and a Kali virtual machine that is preloaded with everything you need for this course. 
The PFSense and Kali virtual machines are completely preconfigured and require no manual setup on the part of 
the student. Unfortunately, it was not possible to provide preconfigured Windows virtual machines due to 
licensing issues. That means you’re going to have to download and configure your Active Directory machines 
yourself. 
With that said, worry not. I’ve gone to great lengths to make the lab setup process as painless as possible by 
providing a set of PowerShell scripts that will do most of the legwork for you. All you have to do is download the 
required ISOs and Virtual Machines and use the provided scripts as described in the sections below. 
Try not to get intimidated by the size of this setup guide. It’s basically a giant picture book, with most of the 
following pages being occupied by screenshots. You should fly through the lab setup process fairly quickly once 
you have everything downloaded. 
Regardless, I do recommend completing the lab setup process before getting to the conference. The reason for this 
is that you’re going to have to download a couple of large files, and you probably don’t want to be stuck doing this 
the night before over flaky conference WiFi. Windows server takes a while to install as well. 
Important: if at any point you run into problems setting up the lab, please do not hesitate to email the instructor for 
assistance.

STEP 1 - DOWNLOAD WINDOWS DEVELOPER VIRTUAL MACHINES 
Microsoft offers free Windows virtual machines to web developers for testing website UIs within different versions 
of Internet Explorer. These virtual machines are made available by Microsoft for public download, giving us a 
means of legally obtaining a free copy of Windows 10 and Windows 8 for use in our lab. 
The following steps can be used to download a Windows 10 Developer VM: 
1. Navigate to the following url: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/ 
2. Select Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 Stable “Virtual machine” dropdown menu. 
3. Select VirtualBox from the “Select platform” dropdown menu. 
4. Click the grey “Download .zip” button at the bottom left in the screen.  
Once you’ve downloaded a Windows 10 virtual machine, repeat this process to obtain a Windows 8 virtual 
machine as well.

STEP 2 - OBTAIN WINDOWS SERVER 2012 R2 TRIAL EDITION 
Next, we need to obtain a copy of Windows Server 2012 R2. Since Windows Server 2012 R2 is pretty expensive, it 
is recommended that you download a 180 day free trial from Microsoft. 
To obtain a free Windows Server 2012 R2 trial: 
1. Navigate to the following URL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-
server-2012-r2 
2. In the expandable list, select Windows Server 2012 R2  Download 
3. Click the green “Sign In” button 
4. You will now be required to authenticate using a valid Microsoft or Skype account. If you don’t 
have one, make one now. 
5. After signing in, you will be redirected back to the previous page. The green “Sign In” button will 
have been replaced with a green button that says “Register to continue”. Click the “Register to 
continue” button.
