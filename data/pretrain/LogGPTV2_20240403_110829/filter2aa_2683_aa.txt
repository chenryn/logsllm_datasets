### Introduction

This workshop utilizes a lab environment consisting of five virtual machines (VMs) connected to the same virtual network. Three of these VMs will run Windows and be integrated into an Active Directory (AD) domain. One Windows machine will serve as the Domain Controller (DC), while the other two will function as workstations. The remaining two VMs include a PFSense instance for firewalling and a Kali Linux VM preloaded with all necessary tools for this course.

The PFSense and Kali VMs are fully preconfigured and require no additional setup by the student. Due to licensing constraints, we cannot provide preconfigured Windows VMs. Therefore, you will need to download and configure the AD machines yourself. To simplify this process, I have provided PowerShell scripts that will handle most of the configuration. You only need to download the required ISOs and VMs and follow the instructions in this guide.

While this setup guide may seem extensive, it is primarily composed of screenshots, making the setup process straightforward once you have all the necessary files. It is recommended to complete the lab setup before attending the conference to avoid potential issues with large file downloads over unreliable WiFi. If you encounter any problems during the setup, please do not hesitate to contact the instructor for assistance.
