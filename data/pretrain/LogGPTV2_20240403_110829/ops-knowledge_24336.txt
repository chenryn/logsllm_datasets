User: I have a web server at Google App Engine and I want to protect my data. My mobile app will access the server to get this data.
The idea is with OAuth authenticate my app, when it requests some data via REST. After the first authentication, the app will always be able to access the content.
I don't want user's data, as Google Account or Facebook. My mobile app will assume the role of user to my services.
Is it possible? Someone has another idea to create these structure?
I'm not using Google End Point and my GAE is developed with Python.
Thank you in advance!

Assistant: I see you say you're not using Endpoints, but not why. It's likely the solution you want, as it's designed precisely for same-party (i.e. you own the backend and the client application) use cases, which is exactly what you've described.
