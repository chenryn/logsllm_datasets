I am developing a D-Bus service that implements a specific protocol. The service sends messages to the client, but due to some bugs in the library I am using, these messages contain unexpected data. I need to identify and fix these issues.

### Questions:
1. **How can I inspect and trace client calls?**
   - I want to determine what the client is requesting and locate the buggy method.
   
2. **How can I trace all calls within the service?**
   - I have already inserted many `logger.debug()` statements, but I need a more comprehensive solution.

### Additional Details:
- The service is written in Python.
- The client is written in C.

### Specific Query:
- How do I specify the path or service to monitor using `dbus-monitor` with both the sender and receiver?
  - For example: `dbus-monitor "sender=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.******"`
