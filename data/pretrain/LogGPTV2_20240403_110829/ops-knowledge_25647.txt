User: I writing Dbus service implementing some protocol. My service sends to client message with unexpected data (library i used has some bugs, that i want to overwrite).
How to inspect, trace client calls? I want to determine what client wants and locate buggy method.
Or how to trace all calls in service? I has much of logger.debug() inserted.
Service is python, client is c.
How to specify path or service to monitor in dbus-monitor with sender and reciever?
Assistant: dbus-monitor "sender=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.******"
