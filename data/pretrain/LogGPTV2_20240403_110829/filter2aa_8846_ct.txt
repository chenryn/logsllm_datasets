The procedures should adhere to the company’s established security policies and answer questions such as, how
do administrators obtain system account passwords during a DR scenario? If some sensitive information is
required during a DR or BC tasks, you need to ensure this information is both secure and accessible to those who
need it.
6.4 Analyze test output and generate reports
The teams that analyze the security procedures should be aware of the output and reporting capabilities for the data. Any
information that is of concern must be reported to the management teams immediately so that they are aware of possible
risks or alerts. The level of detail given to the management teams might vary depending on their roles and involvement.
The type of auditing being performed can also determine the type of reports that must be used. For example, for an SSAE
16 audit, a Service Organization Control (SOC) report is required. There are four types of SOC reports:
 SOC 1 Type 1. This report outlines the findings of an audit, as well as the completeness and accuracy of the
documented controls, systems and facilities.
 SOC 1 Type 2. This report includes the Type 1 report, along with information about the effectiveness of the
procedures and controls in place for the immediate future.
 SOC 2. This report includes the testing results of an audit.
 SOC 3. This report provides general audit results with a datacenter certification level.
6.5 Conduct or facilitate security audits
Security audits should occur on a routine basis according to the policy set in place by the organization. Internal auditing
typically occurs more frequently than external or third-party auditing.
 Internal. Security auditing should be an ongoing task of the security team. There are dozens of software vendors
that simplify the process of aggregating log data. The challenge is knowing what to look for once you have collected
the data.
 External. External security auditing should be performed on a set schedule. This could be aligned with financial
reporting each quarter or some other business-driven reason.
 Third-party. Third-party auditing can be performed on a regular schedule in addition to external auditing. The goal
of third-party auditing can either be to provide checks and balances for the internal and external audits, or to
perform a more in-depth auditing procedure.

Domain 7. Security Operations
This domain is focused on the day-to-day tasks of securing your environment. If you are in a role outside of operations
(such as in engineering or architecture), you should spend extra time in this section to ensure familiarity with the
information. You’ll notice more hands-on sections in this domain, specifically focused on how to do things instead of the
design or planning considerations found in previous domains.
7.1 Understand and support investigations
This section discusses concepts related to supporting security investigations. You should be familiar with the processes in
an investigation. You should know all the fundamentals of collecting and handling evidence, documenting your
investigation, reporting the information, performing root cause analysis, and performing digital forensic tasks.
 Evidence collection and handling. Like a crime scene investigation, a digital investigation involving potential
computer crimes has rules and processes to ensure that evidence is usable in court. At a high level, you need to
ensure that your handling of the evidence doesn’t alter the integrity of the data or environment. To ensure
consistency and integrity of data, your company should have an incident response policy that outlines the steps to
take in the event of a security incident, with key details such as how employees report an incident. Additionally, the
company should have an incident response team that is familiar with the incident response policy and that
represents the key areas of the organization (management, HR, legal, IT, etc.). The team doesn’t have to be
dedicated but instead could have members who have regular work and are called upon only when necessary. With
evidence collection, documentation is key. The moment a report comes in, the documentation process begins. As
part of the documentation process, you must document each time somebody handles evidence and how that
evidence was gathered and moved around; this is known as the chain of custody. Interviewing is often part of
evidence collection. If you need to interview an internal employee as a suspect, an HR representative should be
present. Consider recording all interviews, if that’s legal.
 Reporting and documenting. There are two types of reporting: one for IT with technical details and one for
management without technical details. Both are critical. The company must be fully aware of the incident and kept
up to date as the investigation proceeds. Capture everything possible, including dates, times and pertinent details.
 Investigative techniques. When an incident occurs, you need to find out how it happened. A part of this process
is the root cause analysis, in which you pinpoint the cause (for example, a user clicked on a malicious link in an
email, or a web server was missing a security update and an attacker used an unpatched vulnerability to
compromise the server). Often, teams are formed to help determine the root cause. Incident handling is the overall
management of the investigation — think of it as project management but on a smaller level. NIST and others have
published guidelines for incident handling. At a high level, it includes the following steps: detect, analyze, contain,
eradicate and recover. Of course, there are other smaller parts to incident handling, such as preparation and postincident analysis, like a “lessons learned” review meeting.
 Digital forensics tools, tactics and procedures. Forensics should preserve the crime scene, though in digital
forensics, this means the computers, storage and other devices, instead of a room and a weapon, for example.
Other investigators should be able to perform their own analyses and come to the same conclusions because they
68
have the same data. This requirement impacts many of the operational procedures. In particular, instead of
performing scans, searches and other actions against the memory and storage of computers, you should take
images of the memory and storage, so you can thoroughly examine the contents without modifying the originals.
For network forensics, you should work from copies of network captures acquired during the incident. For
embedded devices, you need to take images of memory and storage and note the configuration. In all cases, leave
everything as is, although your organization might have a policy to have everything removed from the network or
completely shut down. New technologies can introduce new challenges in this area because sometimes existing
tools don’t work (or don’t work as efficiently) with new technologies. For example, when SSDs were introduced,
they presented challenges for some of the old ways of working with disk drives.
7.2 Understand the requirements for different types of investigations
Your investigation will vary based on the type of incident you are investigating. For example, if you work for a financial
company and there was a compromise of a financial system, you might have a regulatory investigation. If a hacker defaces
your company website, you might have a criminal investigation. Each type of investigation has special considerations:
 Administrative. The primary purpose of an administrative investigation is to provide the appropriate authorities
with all relevant information so they can determine what, if any, action to take. Administrative investigations are
often tied to HR scenarios, such as when a manager has been accused of improprieties.
 Criminal. A criminal investigation occurs when a crime has been committed and you are working with a law
enforcement agency to convict the alleged perpetrator. In such a case, it is common to gather evidence for a court
of law, and to have to share the evidence with the defense. Therefore, you need to gather and handle the
information using methods that ensure that the evidence can be used in court . We covered some key points earlier,
such as chain of custody. Be sure to remember that in a criminal case, a suspect must be proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. This is more difficult than showing a preponderance of evidence, which is often the standard in
a civil case.
 Civil. In a civil case, one person or entity sues another person or entity; for example, one company might sue
another for a trademark violation. A civil case typically seeks monetary damages, not incarceration or a criminal
record. As we just saw, the burden of proof is less in a civil case.
 Regulatory. A regulatory investigation is conducted by a regulating body, such as the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) or Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), against an organization suspected of an
infraction. In such cases, the organization is required to comply with the investigation, for example, by not hiding
or destroying evidence.
 Industry standards. An industry standards investigation is intended to determine whether an organization is
adhering to a specific industry standard or set of standards, such as logging and auditing failed logon attempts.
Because industry standards represent well-understood and widely implemented best practices, many
organizations try to adhere to them even when they are not required to do so in order to reduce security,
operational and other risks.

7.3 Conduct logging and monitoring activities
This section covers logging and monitoring.
 Intrusion detection and prevention. There are two technologies that you can use to detect and prevent
intrusions. You should use both. Some solutions combine them into a single software package or appliance.
 An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a technology (typically software or an appliance) that attempts to
identify malicious activity in your environment. Solutions often rely on patterns, signatures, or anomalies.
There are multiple types of IDS solutions. For example, there are solutions specific to the network (network
IDS or NIDS) and others specific to computers (host-based IDS or HIDS).
 An intrusion prevention system (IPS) can help block an attack before it gets inside your network. In the
worst case, it can identify an attack in progress. Like an IDS, an IPS is often a software or appliance. However,
an IPS is typically placed in line on the network so it can analyze traffic coming into or leaving the network,
whereas an IDS typically sees intrusions after they’ve occurred.
 Security information and event management (SIEM). Companies have security information stored in logs across
multiple computers and appliances. Often, the information captured in the logs is so extensive that it can quickly
become hard to manage and use. Many companies deploy a security information and event management (SIEM)
solution to centralize the log data and make it simpler to work with. For example, if you need to find all failed logon
attempts on your web servers, you could look through the logs on each web server individually. But if you have a
SIEM solution, you can go to a portal and search across all web servers with a single query. A SIEM is a critical
technology in large and security-conscious organizations.
 Continuous monitoring. Continuous monitoring is the process of streaming information related to the security
of the computing environment in real time (or close to real time). Some SIEM solutions offer continuous monitoring
or at least some features of continuous monitoring.
 Egress monitoring. Egress monitoring is the monitoring of data as it leaves your network. One reason is to ensure
that malicious traffic doesn’t leave the network (for example, in a situation in which a computer is infected and
trying to spread malware to hosts on the internet). Another reason is to ensure that sensitive data (such as
customer information or HR information) does not leave the network unless authorized. The following strategies
can help with egress monitoring:
 Data loss prevention (DLP) solutions focus on reducing or eliminating sensitive data leaving the network.
 Steganography is the art of hiding data inside another file or message. For example, steganography
enables a text message to be hidden inside a picture file (such as a .jpg). Because the file appears innocuous,
it can be difficult to detect.
 Watermarking is the act of embedding an identifying marker in a file. For example, you can embed a
company name in a customer database file or add a watermark to a picture file with copyright information.
