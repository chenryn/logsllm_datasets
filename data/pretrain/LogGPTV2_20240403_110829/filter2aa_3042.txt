National Security Perspective
✴ All conﬂicts now have a cyber dimension
✴ Tactical: espionage, propaganda, DoS, CIP
✴ Strategic: terror / war ?
✴ Strategic problems req strategic solutions
✴ Nation-state, international
✴ Beyond tactical, temporary ﬁxes
Research Question
How to prioritize nation-state cyber attack 
mitigation strategies?
1. Next-Generation Internet: IPv6
2. Sun Tzu’s Art of War
3. Cyber attack deterrence
4. Cyber arms control
Research Outline 1
1. Cyber security
   Technical discipline to strategic concept
2. Technical primer
   Hacking, security analysis, simulations
3. Real-world impact
   Internal security, internat’l conﬂict, case studies
Research Outline 2
4. Threat mitigation strategies
Technical, military, political
5. DEMATEL method
Strategic analysis / calculate indirect inﬂuence
6. Strategy prioritization
Recommendation to policymakers

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
✴ Reduces anonymity
✴ China: “Everyone”  US: “Everything”
✴ Limitless IPs, NAT not required
✴ Security game-changer
✴ Native IPSec: authentication, encryption
✴ No silver bullet
✴ SW/users still vulnerable
