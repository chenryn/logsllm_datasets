After associating each of the 58K discovered peerings (ir-
respective of the assigned conﬁdence) with the correspond-
ing IXP, we rank the IXPs in decreasing order of the to-
tal number of associated discovered peerings and show in
Fig. 4 the ranked IXPs (x-axis) and their sizes (y-axis),
broken down by the portions of peerings to which we as-
signed “high”, “medium”, and “low” conﬁdence, resp. The
plot shows that the “high conﬁdence” or “validated” peerings
dominate the left-hand-side of the ﬁgure where the number
of discovered peerings at an IXP is high. At the same time,
there are many IXPs on the right-hand-side of the ﬁgure that
have a majority of “low conﬁdence” peerings, consistent with
our earlier observation that the success or failure of discov-
ering the peering matrices of small IXPs is highly dependent
on the location of our LGs with respect to those IXPs and
their members. Also note that the absence of the ground
truth as far as the total number of peerings at an IXP is
concerned prevents us from indicating in Fig. 4 how far oﬀ
we are compared to the total number of actual peerings that
exist at each IXP.

IXPs ranked by # of members
Figure 5: Members per IXP.
A method for measuring the size of an IXP and for which
a comparison with the ground truth is possible is in terms
of number of members. On the one hand, we take as ground
truth the member lists obtained from the IXP websites (when
available) or from PCH or PeeringDB, yielding a total of
4K member ASes. On the other hand, we infer the number
of members of an IXP via the discovered peerings associ-
ated with that IXP. Note that the latter results in a natural
classiﬁcation of IXP members into “high”, “medium”, and
“low” conﬁdence members, depending on the conﬁdence we
assigned to the discovered peering links between the ASes in-
volved in the discovered peerings at that IXP. For example,
if IXP X is known to have three members (i.e., AS1, AS2,
and AS3), and if we discover the peerings AS1-AS2 and AS2-
AS3 with any of the three conﬁdence levels, we conclude that
AS1, AS2, and AS3 all are members at IXP X, irrespective
of what we know or don’t know about the relationship be-
tween AS2 and AS3. Moreover, AS1, AS2, and AS3 will
be classiﬁed as “high”, “medium”, or “low” conﬁdence mem-
347bers based on the highest conﬁdence attribute assigned to
the corresponding peerings. Fig. 5 shows the the 223 IXPs
ranked in decreasing order of the total number of members
(based on the ground truth) 12. The plot depicts the por-
tions of members that were classiﬁed as “high”, “medium”,
and “low” conﬁdence members and also shows the fraction
of members of each IXP that was not discovered by our
method. The good news is that our method performs well
for the large IXPs where the diﬀerence between the ground
truth and the discovered members is typically small and the
conﬁdence assigned to the discovered members is in general
high. An exception is Interlan IX (at x=48), for which we
could not validate any member.

Figure 6: Member presence (log-log).
Sizing IXPs as shown in Fig. 5 only counts the number
of IXP members, but does not distinguish them in terms of
size or type.
In particular, there are several reasons why
one and the same AS can show up in the membership list
at a number of diﬀerent IXPs; e.g., increased resilience, con-
nectivity with a particular member, connectivity in a par-
ticular location served by the IXP. Counting for each of the
4K member ASes the number of IXPs where its presence
was discovered by our method, we then rank the ASes in
decreasing order of this member presence and plot in Fig.6
for each AS the number of IXPs where it is present, broken
down by the level of conﬁdence we have in the discovered
membership. Among the top networks we ﬁnd two content
providers: Google (present in 35 IXPs) and Limelight Net-
works (present in 29 IXPs). For obvious reasons, PCH tops
all networks with its presence in 39 IXPs. Note that if an
organization uses diﬀerent ASNs to peer at IXPs, then each
ASN will be plotted separately on the x axis. For example,
according to the IXP databases, ISC is present as AS3557
in 42 diﬀerent IXPs, and this number is plotted at x=4 in
Fig. 6 as representing the ground truth. However, in our
datasets, ISC appears with ASN 3557 at only 4 IXPs and
with 18 other ASNs at other IXPs (showing up at a diﬀerent
x-value in the Fig. 6). This deﬁciency of our analysis could
be addressed by grouping ASes that are part of one and the
same organization or company, but we have currently no
principled method for performing such a grouping.
When an AS becomes a member of an IXP, it will typi-
cally peer with several other members at that IXP. For each
of the 4K member ASes, we count the number of discov-
12Note that the IXP ranking in Fig. 5 is not the same as in
Fig. 4, and so a direct comparison between equally ranked
IXPs is not meaningful.

ered IXP-related peerings established by this member AS,
rank them in decreasing order of this member connectivity,
and show in Fig. 7 a rank-ordered plot, broken down by
the level of conﬁdence we assigned to the discovered peer-
ings. Among the networks that peer most aggressively at the
IXPs, we encountered PCH (again for obvious reasons), sev-
eral Tier-2 ISPs, and Limelight Networks with 500 peerings.
Google appears in this analysis with 151 peerings (at a total
of 35 IXPs). Similar to ISC, EUnet (x=25 in Fig. 7) owns
two diﬀerent AS numbers. Our validation method could not
recognize that they belong to the same organization, and
could assign a high conﬁdence to only 6 out of 359 discov-
ered peerings.

Lastly, a network may not only be present at multiple
IXPs, but may in fact have several peering sessions with
the same member AS at those multiple IXPs. For exam-
ple, to eliminate long transit traﬃc and keep the traﬃc lo-
cal, two geographically distributed networks will establish a
peering session at each IXP location where they are both
present. For each AS pair, we count the total the number of
discovered peerings, rank the pairs by their member multi-
connectivity, and show in Fig. 8 a plot broken down by the
level of conﬁdence that we assigned to the discovered peer-
ings. Among the top AS pairs are Google and Limelight who
peer with one another at 16 diﬀerent IXPs. The peering at
x=15 for which we have only low conﬁdence information,
corresponds to links between Cogent (AS174) and AT&T
(AS7018). Again, the use of multiple AS numbers by the
same entity, explains the problem. For instance, at Espanix
and AMS-IX, AT&T appears under the AS number 2686.

We have attempted to map all IXPs using the most com-
plete input data, various databases (IXP databases, web-
sites, IRR), and by looking for IXPs in all the known publicly
available datasets produced and used by Internet topology
researchers (CAIDA, DIMES, PlanetLab). We propose new
methods to build additional datasets (targeted traceroutes,
source routing, BGP tables). We detect 223 IXPs out of
278 and show that most of the remaining undetected IXPs
are actually inactive or not visible to tracerouting. We also
discover signiﬁcantly more IXP-related peerings than previ-
ous studies and show that these peerings are not present in
currently-used AS maps of the Internet.
As for future work, running our tools regularly will help us
understand the evolution of IXPs. New members are added
regularly13, and large IXPs claim to have witnessed an ex-
ponential growth during the last few years. Fine-tuning our
techniques to eliminate the number of low and medium conﬁ-
dence peerings and focusing on the remaining “islands” in the
IXP substrate of the AS-level Internet that have remained
by and large invisible to our method will bring our IXP map-
ping eﬀort to a successful conclusion. Such ﬁne-tuning will
also require the development of a principled approach for
identifying and dealing with ASes that use multiple ASNs.
However, deriving the traﬃc matrices of IXPs on top of the
peering matrices (the main focus of this paper) looms as an
important but challenging open problem. Large IXPs typi-
cally report a total volume of traﬃc on the order of Gbps.
The use of state-of-the-art tools for bandwidth measurement
might help us shed light on this important part of the Inter-
net traﬃc.
