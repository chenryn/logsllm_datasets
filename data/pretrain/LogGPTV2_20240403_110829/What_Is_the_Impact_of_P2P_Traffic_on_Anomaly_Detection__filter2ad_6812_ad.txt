peculiarities of p2p protocols and clients.
5 Mitigating the Torrent Eﬀect
Based on the empirical accuracy results of the last section, in this section we
discuss how can we make an anomaly detector resilient to p2p traﬃc. While
the right method to make an anomaly detector resilient to p2p traﬃc is to avoid
detection features which overlap between malicious and p2p traﬃc, in this section
we only discuss an ad hoc method that can be used to make existing IDSs work
with p2p traﬃc. In the following section, we will discuss how future anomaly
detectors can inherently cater for p2p traﬃc in their design philosophy.
5.1 Can a Pragmatic Solution Be Designed to Make an Anomaly
Detector Insensitive to p2p Traﬃc?
Our evaluations in Section 4 show that the torrent eﬀect is mainly caused by
initiation of a large number of connections by p2p applications and failed con-
nection attempts in those connections. This behavior of p2p applications is a
result of: 1) lack of a central repository in p2p networks to maintain up-to-date
information of available peers; and 2) ensuring robustness in p2p networks even
with high churn rates. While these key design features of p2p networks can be
achieved in a less aggressive manner, p2p applications perform unrelenting at-
tempts to establish connections to thwart techniques to curb p2p connections.
The means used to achieve these design goals of p2p networks result in an overlap
with malicious behavior.
Since p2p protocols are unlikely to change their behavior in the near-term, and
as an IDS designer cannot assume any control over these applications’ behaviors,
12

pre-processor
a simple solution to mitigate the torrent eﬀect is to ﬁlter p2p traﬃc at the input
of an anomaly detector using a p2p traﬃc classiﬁer. Filtering of p2p traﬃc will
result in segregation of non-p2p and p2p traﬃc as shown in Figure 5. Such a pre-
processing ﬁlter can be followed by the IDS logic which, in the present context,
will only operate on the non-p2p traﬃc; anomaly detection on the segregated
p2p traﬃc will be discussed in the following section. Since contemporary IDSs
are designed to work with non-p2p traﬃc, detection in the segregated non-p2p
traﬃc will be performed on the unique and non-overlapping characteristics of
malicious traﬃc, thereby yielding good accuracies. This p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation
based solution has an additional advantage that it requires no changes to be made
to existing IDSs. Consequently, at the cost of higher complexity, this generic
p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation based pre-processor can be integrated into any anomaly
detector.
There are two problems with this p2p traﬃc ﬁltering solution: 1) An IDS’
accuracy in this design is closely tied to the accuracy of the p2p traﬃc classiﬁer,
i.e., if the p2p traﬃc classiﬁer can classify p2p traﬃc accurately, then anomaly
detection accuracy will improve, and vice versa; 2) Attacks embedded within p2p
traﬃc will not be detected. The rest of this section address the ﬁrst point, while
the second point is deferred to the next section. In particular, the next subsec-
tion answers the following question: Can existing public p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation
solutions mitigate the torrent eﬀect?

5.2 Can Existing Public p2p Traﬃc Classiﬁers Mitigate the Torrent
Eﬀect?
The p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation problem has been well investigated and signature-
and heuristic-based solutions exist. We, however, argue that many existing
heuristic-based solutions will also be subject to the overlapping feature limita-
tion.6 Therefore, it is important to choose approaches which use non-overlapping
heuristics. We now evaluate our proposed design on a popular DPI-based tech-
nology and on a hybrid scheme (signatures + heuristics).
We perform traﬃc ﬁltering using OpenDPI [23] (a signature based solution
with over 90 signatures) and Karagiannis’ Payload Classiﬁer(KPC) [24] (a hy-
brid solution with over 59 signatures); we refer interested readers to the orig-
inal papers for the details of OpenDPI and KPC. The results of evaluation of
the four anomaly detectors on ﬁltered traﬃc are shown in Table 3. Table 3
shows that KPC (unknown: 35.2%) provides remarkably better accuracy than
OpenDPI (unknown: 96.2%), mainly because OpenDPI is unable to detect any
encrypted p2p traﬃc. It can be clearly seen by comparing Table 3 and Table 4
that the improvements in anomaly detectors’ accuracies are dependent on the
traﬃc classiﬁer’s accuracy. One of the limiting factors in the accuracy of the
traﬃc classiﬁers is encrypted traﬃc.
We note from Table 3 that the current traﬃc classiﬁcation accuracies of the
DPI solutions are inadequate to induce a signiﬁcant improvement in anomaly
detection accuracy; detection rates after p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation range from 40-
70%, while false positives are between 6-40% for diﬀerent anomaly detectors.
Since the accuracies reported in Table 3 are impractical for commercial deploy-
ments, we conclude that public p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation solutions at present
cannot provide acceptable accuracies to induce an eﬀective accuracy improve-
ment in anomaly detection. While many commercial p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation

be used in the present context.

Fig. 6. Connection timeline for p2p and malicious (portscan attack) traﬃc
solutions are available, to the best of our knowledge, none of the p2p traﬃc clas-
siﬁers proposed by the research community have acceptable detection accuracies
for encrypted p2p traﬃc. Therefore, eﬃcient p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation remains an
open problem and a solution to this problem will beneﬁt the IDS community as
well as the traﬃc engineering community.
Until such a solution is developed, we need to identify non-overlapping (be-
tween malicious and p2p) traﬃc features that an anomaly detector can rely on.
As a preliminary, result, Figure 6 shows the connection timeline for the p2p and
malicious traﬃc. It can be seen that the sustained activity of maliciousness is
very diﬀerent from the sporadic p2p traﬃc activity. Therefore, p2p and mali-
cious traﬃc can be isolated if a notion of long-term statistics can be introduced
during anomaly detection. This is part of our ongoing research.
6 What Are the Open Problems in Designing Future
Anomaly Detectors?
The tremendous growth in p2p-based ﬁle sharing, VOIP and video streaming
traﬃc has revolutionized the Internet traﬃc characteristics. Our evaluations
showed that this change in traﬃc characteristics cannot be characterized by
existing anomaly detectors which rely on traﬃc features (e.g., rate, connection
failures, ports, etc.) that largely overlap with p2p traﬃc behavior. While we
proposed an adhoc solution which allows existing IDSs to work eﬀectively, a
question remains open regarding the scalability of this solution to future Inter-
net traﬃc. Recent projections of future attacks show that some of the greatest
threats in the future will be originating from ﬁle sharing networks [28]. In such
What Is the Impact of P2P Traﬃc on Anomaly Detection?
15
a threat landscape, a p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation based solution will simply allow
all malicious activities embedded within p2p traﬃc to go undetected.
While detection of malware delivered using p2p applications does not fall un-
der the scope of traﬃc anomaly detection, attacks originating from p2p networks
should be detected using these IDSs. One such attacks has already been proposed
in [27] where Naoumov and Ross designed a DDoS engine for ﬂooding a target
using the indexing and routing layers in a p2p systems. Similarly, IDSs should
be able to detect the exploits targeted at vulnerabilities which are a product of
the change to ﬁrewall rules for p2p traﬃc [29]. Finally, it is highly desirable to
detect the C&C channels of bots which also use p2p communication [30].
Given the premise that p2p traﬃc is here to stay, our work demonstrates
the need to rethink the classical anomaly detection design philosophy with a
focus on performing anomaly detection in the presence p2p traﬃc. We argue
that p2p traﬃc classiﬁcation will play a fundamental role in future IDSs as it
will facilitate detection of both the p2p and the non-p2p traﬃc anomalies, as
shown in Figure 5. In our proposed design, traditional non-p2p network attacks
will be detected using existing anomaly detectors, while an additional IDS that
specializes at detecting attacks within p2p traﬃc will also be deployed.
Design of a p2p-specialized IDS is still an open research problem that is part
of our ongoing research and that we also expect our peers to follow-up on. We
have made our dataset publicly available for performance benchmarking of such
future IDSs and p2p traﬃc classiﬁers.
