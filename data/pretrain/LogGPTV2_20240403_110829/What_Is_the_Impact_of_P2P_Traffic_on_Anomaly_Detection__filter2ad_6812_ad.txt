### Peculiarities of P2P Protocols and Clients

#### 5. Mitigating the Torrent Effect

Based on the empirical accuracy results from the previous section, this section discusses how to make an anomaly detector resilient to P2P traffic. While the ideal method is to avoid detection features that overlap between malicious and P2P traffic, we will focus on an ad hoc method that can be used to adapt existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to handle P2P traffic. In the following section, we will explore how future anomaly detectors can inherently accommodate P2P traffic in their design.

#### 5.1 Can a Pragmatic Solution Be Designed to Make an Anomaly Detector Insensitive to P2P Traffic?

Our evaluations in Section 4 show that the "torrent effect" is primarily caused by the initiation of a large number of connections by P2P applications and the frequent failed connection attempts. This behavior is due to:
1. The lack of a central repository in P2P networks to maintain up-to-date information about available peers.
2. The need to ensure robustness in P2P networks, even with high churn rates.

While these key design features of P2P networks could be achieved in a less aggressive manner, P2P applications often perform relentless attempts to establish connections to counteract techniques aimed at curbing P2P connections. This aggressive behavior results in an overlap with malicious activity.

Since P2P protocols are unlikely to change their behavior in the near term, and IDS designers have no control over these applications' behaviors, a simple solution to mitigate the torrent effect is to filter P2P traffic at the input of an anomaly detector using a P2P traffic classifier. Filtering P2P traffic will segregate non-P2P and P2P traffic, as shown in Figure 5. A preprocessing filter can then be followed by the IDS logic, which, in the current context, will only operate on the non-P2P traffic. Anomaly detection on the segregated P2P traffic will be discussed in the next section.

Contemporary IDSs are designed to work with non-P2P traffic, so detection in the segregated non-P2P traffic will be based on the unique and non-overlapping characteristics of malicious traffic, thereby improving accuracy. This P2P traffic classification-based solution has the additional advantage of requiring no changes to existing IDSs. Consequently, at the cost of higher complexity, this generic P2P traffic classification-based pre-processor can be integrated into any anomaly detector.

There are two main issues with this P2P traffic filtering solution:
1. The accuracy of the IDS is closely tied to the accuracy of the P2P traffic classifier. If the classifier can accurately identify P2P traffic, anomaly detection accuracy will improve, and vice versa.
2. Attacks embedded within P2P traffic will not be detected.

The rest of this section addresses the first point, while the second point is deferred to the next section. Specifically, the next subsection answers the following question: Can existing public P2P traffic classifiers mitigate the torrent effect?

#### 5.2 Can Existing Public P2P Traffic Classifiers Mitigate the Torrent Effect?

The problem of P2P traffic classification has been well-studied, and both signature- and heuristic-based solutions exist. However, many existing heuristic-based solutions may also suffer from the overlapping feature limitation. Therefore, it is important to choose approaches that use non-overlapping heuristics. We evaluate our proposed design using a popular Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)-based technology and a hybrid scheme (signatures + heuristics).

We perform traffic filtering using OpenDPI [23] (a signature-based solution with over 90 signatures) and Karagiannis’ Payload Classifier (KPC) [24] (a hybrid solution with over 59 signatures). The results of evaluating the four anomaly detectors on filtered traffic are shown in Table 3. Table 3 indicates that KPC (unknown: 35.2%) provides significantly better accuracy than OpenDPI (unknown: 96.2%), mainly because OpenDPI cannot detect encrypted P2P traffic. Comparing Table 3 and Table 4, it is clear that the improvements in anomaly detector accuracies depend on the traffic classifier's accuracy. One limiting factor is the presence of encrypted traffic.

From Table 3, we note that the current traffic classification accuracies of DPI solutions are inadequate for inducing significant improvements in anomaly detection. Detection rates after P2P traffic classification range from 40-70%, while false positives are between 6-40% for different anomaly detectors. Since these accuracies are impractical for commercial deployments, we conclude that public P2.P traffic classification solutions currently cannot provide acceptable accuracies to effectively improve anomaly detection. While many commercial P2P traffic classification solutions are available, none of the research-proposed classifiers have acceptable detection accuracies for encrypted P2P traffic. Therefore, efficient P2P traffic classification remains an open problem, and a solution would benefit both the IDS community and the traffic engineering community.

Until such a solution is developed, we need to identify non-overlapping (between malicious and P2P) traffic features that an anomaly detector can rely on. As a preliminary result, Figure 6 shows the connection timeline for P2P and malicious traffic. It can be seen that the sustained activity of malicious traffic is very different from the sporadic P2P traffic activity. Therefore, P2P and malicious traffic can be isolated if long-term statistics are introduced during anomaly detection. This is part of our ongoing research.

#### 6. What Are the Open Problems in Designing Future Anomaly Detectors?

The significant growth in P2P-based file sharing, VoIP, and video streaming traffic has transformed Internet traffic characteristics. Our evaluations show that existing anomaly detectors, which rely on traffic features (e.g., rate, connection failures, ports, etc.) that largely overlap with P2P traffic behavior, are insufficient. While we proposed an ad hoc solution to allow existing IDSs to work effectively, the scalability of this solution to future Internet traffic remains an open question. Recent projections indicate that some of the greatest future threats will originate from file-sharing networks [28]. In such a threat landscape, a P2P traffic classification-based solution will simply allow all malicious activities embedded within P2P traffic to go undetected.

While detecting malware delivered via P2P applications is not within the scope of traffic anomaly detection, attacks originating from P2P networks should be detected using these IDSs. For example, Naoumov and Ross [27] designed a DDoS engine for flooding a target using the indexing and routing layers in a P2P system. Similarly, IDSs should be able to detect exploits targeted at vulnerabilities resulting from changes to firewall rules for P2P traffic [29]. Finally, it is highly desirable to detect the Command and Control (C&C) channels of bots that use P2P communication [30].

Given that P2P traffic is here to stay, our work highlights the need to rethink the classical anomaly detection design philosophy with a focus on performing anomaly detection in the presence of P2P traffic. We argue that P2P traffic classification will play a fundamental role in future IDSs, facilitating the detection of both P2P and non-P2P traffic anomalies, as shown in Figure 5. In our proposed design, traditional non-P2P network attacks will be detected using existing anomaly detectors, while an additional IDS specialized in detecting attacks within P2P traffic will also be deployed.

Designing a P2P-specialized IDS remains an open research problem, which is part of our ongoing research. We have made our dataset publicly available for performance benchmarking of such future IDSs and P2P traffic classifiers.
