MAC, such as various inter-frame spacings. Since some of these
overheads are ﬁxed in terms of absolute time, e.g., the slot-time is
20 μs, their relative overhead for wider channels is higher. In order
to more accurately capture the peak throughput at different modu-
lations and channel widths, we extend the model presented in [18].
The idea of this model is to predict the time tpacket required for
one single packet transaction. This total transaction time consists
of SIFS, DIFS, and the time to send the data and the 802.11 ac-
knowledgement: t = tDIF S + tdata + tSIF S + tack. The inverse
of this per-packet transmission time multiplied by the number of
bytes per packet exchange then corresponds to the throughput.
According to the 802.11g standard [1], the basic timing param-
eters in ad hoc mode are tSIF S = 10 μs, tslot = 20 μs, and
tDIF S = 2tslot + tSIF S = 50 μs. For the actual data packet,
and 1/ttotal exchanges per second can be completed. Multiplying
by the number of user data bits per packet (sdata − 76 bytes=
1460 bytes) yields the expected peak throughput.
In our setup, data and ACK size are sdata = 1536 bytes and
sack = 14 bytes including all headers. Rack is the rate at which
the MAC-layer ACK packet is transmitted. In our setup, Rack = 6
if R = 6, 9, 12, Rack = 12 if R = 18, 24, and Rack = 24 if
R ≥ 36.
Figure 3 shows how well the model predicts the throughput of the
UDP ﬂow at different conﬁgurations. At low data rates, our model
almost exactly predicts the peak throughput for all four channel
width options. The reason for the increasing discrepancy at wider
channels and high modulations is that beacons and background
noise (that are unaccounted for in the model) incur a higher per-
packet overhead in these conditions.
3.2 Transmission Range
Changing the channel width impacts the transmission range of
a wireless signal. This is primarily because of two main reasons:
improved SNR and resilience to delay spread. We investigate the
impact of both these factors on range in this subsection.
3.2.1 Improved SNR
We ﬁrst investigate the resilience to noise using the emulator
setup but unlike the previous experiment, we attenuate the signal
between the two nodes. The transmission power of the radios is set
to 1 mW, which is the minimum value supported by the chipsets we
used in our experiment.
Figure 4 shows the loss rate as a function of the attenuation for
different channel widths. The modulation is ﬁxed to 6 in this graph.
We see that narrower widths are able to withstand greater attenua-
tion, which implies that they can reach further. We deﬁne the range
threshold of the signal as the minimum attenuation at which the
loss rate is less than 10%. Then, we can see this threshold is 74 dB
for 40 MHz and 81 dB for 5 MHz. As we discuss below, this 7 dB
difference is substantial because dB is a logarithmic unit.
The longer range of narrower widths can be explained as follows.
For the same total energy used by a Wi-Fi radio to transmit a signal,
the transmission power depends on the channel width measured in
Hz, and power per unit Hz. Thus, at narrower widths, the radio can
transmit with higher power per unit Hz without changing the total
transmission power. Given equivalent noise per unit Hz across var-

channel widths at modulation 6.
Figure 5: The range threshold for different channel widths and
modulations. Higher threshold implies longer range.
ious widths, the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) is higher for narrower
widths, giving them a longer range.
However, the advantage we observe in practice differs from the
maximum possible gain. As per above, halving the channel width
should yield a 3 dB gain, or a 9 dB gain from 40 to 5 MHz. But the
actual gain is only 7 dB across those two widths, which suggests
that our hardware is leaving some potential gains on the table.
We repeated the experiment on an attenuator for different modu-
lations. Figure 5 shows that the range advantage of narrower widths
exists across all modulations. We see that lower modulations pro-
vide a range beneﬁt that is almost equivalent to the emulator. Com-
pared to 40 MHz at modulation 48, one can get a 6 dB range advan-
tage either by reducing the channel width to 5 MHz while keeping
the same modulation or by reducing the modulation to 12 while
keeping the same channel width. One view, thus, of variable chan-
nel widths is that it offers ﬁner scale modulations that otherwise do
not exist.
To illustrate how the 7 dB advantage of 5 MHz over 40 MHz
translates to better range in terms of real distance, we consider the
following simplistic model. Assume that signal power decays as
1/dα, with the distance d and path-loss exponent α, the maxi-
mum range A in dB attenuation corresponds to a maximum dis-
tance dmax as

A = 10 log10

Therefore, we can estimate the proportional increase in range stem-
ming from a ΔA dB increase in maximum attenuation (say, from

Figure 6: Indoor range for two modulations as a function of
channel width.
The table above shows the range improvement as a function of α,
which depends on the exact environment. Its value is 2 in free space
and typically estimated as between 2 and 4 in real settings. The
numbers above are meant as rough guidelines rather than precise
predictions since we ignore multipath effects as well as many other
practically relevant aspects of wireless signal propagation.
Figure 6 shows that the range beneﬁts in reality roughly reﬂect
the calculations above. In this experiment, we use an ofﬁce as unit
of distance and deﬁne range as the minimum number of ofﬁces
crossed at which the loss rate between two nodes is 100%. This unit
is of course very coarse but obstacles and severe multipath effects
imply that exact signal attenuation is hard to quantify indoors. The
ofﬁces are of identical size, and there are 8 ofﬁces in a straight line.
The graph shows results for modulations 48 and 54. At lower
modulations, we could not reach the edge of communication for
all channel widths. We see that narrower channels signiﬁcantly
increase range. At modulation 48, for instance, the range advantage
of 5 MHz over 40 MHz is 3 additional ofﬁces or a 75% gain.
Finally, because an increase of X in range corresponds to an in-
crease of X 2 in area covered, range increases can have signiﬁcant
practical impact for network coverage. Assuming a plane, for in-
stance, the additional range in our indoor measurement amounts to
over 200% more area.
3.2.2 Resilience to delay spread
At long communication distances, wireless receivers get multi-
ple copies of a signal due to multipath reﬂections. Delay spread is
the time difference between the arrival of the ﬁrst and last copies
of the multipath components. Delay spread can hinder correct de-
coding of a transmission at the receiver because a signal begins to
interfere with a time-delayed copy of itself, also known as Inter-
symbol Interference (ISI). Modern radios use a RAKE receiver to
counter delay spread, but their effectiveness depends on the coding
scheme and the extent of delay spread [2].
OFDM speciﬁes a guard interval at the start of every symbol
to counter delay spread. For better packet recovery, a copy of the
tail of the packet is included in the guard interval, called the cyclic
preﬁx. For 802.11 at 20 MHz channel width, the guard interval is
800 ns, which is one-quarter of the symbol duration. This value
of the guard interval has been shown to tolerate root-mean-square
(r.m.s.) delay spreads of upto 250 ns [7]. Therefore, 20 MHz chan-
nel width provides good resilience to delay spread in most indoor
environments, where the delay spread has been shown to be 50
ns in homes, 100 ns in ofﬁces, and 300 ns in industrial environ-
ments [8]. However, the delay spreads are larger in outdoor envi-
ronments, even up to 1 μs, where IEEE 802.11 is known to give
poor performance [2, 6].
As mentioned in Section 2, the guard interval increases by a fac-
tor of two each time the channel width is halved. Therefore, we
expect higher delay spread resilience in narrower channel widths.
Figure 8 shows the power consumed by different channel widths
while idling, receiving, and sending packets. We present results for
modulation 6, although, for the same channel width, the numbers
were the same across different modulations. The ﬁgure indicates a
linear relationship between the channel width and the power con-
sumption. We see that wider channels consume more power. The
additional consumption from 5 to 40 MHz is around 40% while
idling and receiving packets and is 20% while sending packets.
Thus, substantial powers savings can accrue from switching to nar-
rower channels when appropriate.
The above measurements were conducted on the latest Atheros
chipsets, AR5005GS, which have been optimized to consume less
power when using a 20 MHz channel width. We also performed
these experiments with older cards, off-the-shelf Netgear WAG511s,
and the trend across bandwidths was similar, although the absolute
numbers were much higher. For example, the power used to send
was 2.17 W at 40 MHz channel width compared to 1.94 W with the
newer cards. Similarly, the send power for 5 MHz channel width
was 1.92 W instead of 1.61 W. We believe that further improve-
ments in power proﬁles of Wi-Fi chipsets will lead to lower power
consumption at narrower channel widths.
In summary, we showed the following properties:
The decrease in power consumption can be explained by a slower
clock speed that is used at narrower channel widths. In other areas
of computing, energy optimization using clock frequency scaling of
CPUs has of course been investigated for a long time, e.g. [10, 23].
Our results show that reducing the frequency of the clock in a Wi-Fi
chipset also has a signiﬁcant impact on energy consumption.
3.4 Results Summary
• At small communication distances, throughput increases with
channel width. The increase in not proportional to the channel
width due to MAC layer overheads.
• Decreasing the channel width increases communication range.
We get a 3 dB improvement by halving the channel width due to
better SNR. Narrower channel widths also have better resilience to
delay spread.
• Narrower channel widths consume less battery power when send-
ing and receiving packets, as well as in the idle states. A 5 MHz
channel width consumes 40% less power when idle, and 20% less
power when sending packets than 40 MHz channel width.
4. BENEFITS OF ADAPTING WIDTH
Having explored the basic capabilities provided by different chan-
nel widths, we now give some examples of how adapting channel
width brings certain unique beneﬁts.
A. Reduce power and increase range simultaneously
Fixed channel width systems face a tough choice between in-
creasing range and reducing power consumption. They can in-
crease range by increasing transmission power or using lower mod-
ulation. Using lower modulations does not change the instanta-
neous power consumption.
Increasing transmit power increases
battery power consumption. Adaptive channel width systems can
have both! Narrower channels have both lower power consumption
and longer range. Reducing channel width may come at the cost of
reduced throughput, however, and so the width should be reduced
when the additional throughput of the wider channel is not desired.
Though, as our results below will show, in some cases narrower
channels can improve throughput as well.
B. Improving ﬂow throughput
The key motivation for our work is the following observation:
although the peak throughput of wider channels is higher, the chan-
nel width offering the best throughput in a given setting depends on
Figure 7: The loss rate experienced by different channel widths
as a function of the delay spread conﬁgured in the emulator.
Figure 8: Power consumption of different channel widths in
various modes.
To systematically evaluate the resilience of different widths to de-
lay spread, we conducted controlled experiments using a wireless
emulator. The emulator uses a two-ray channel model in which
a delayed copy of the transmitted signal is attenuated and mixed
with the original before arriving at the receiving radio. This em-
ulates one direct line-of-sight signal and one reﬂected signal that
followed a longer path. The parameters to this model are the de-
lay between the two signals and their relative strengths at the re-
ceiver. In a real world setup, more reﬂected signals are likely to be
present, but this experiment serves to provide an understanding of
how channel width affects delay spread resilience.
For this experiment, we use the two-ray ground model in which
the attenuation of the reﬂected ray with respect to the direct ray
was set to 6 dB and the relative delay was input as a parameter.
The direct ray was not attenuated. The delay spread is varied from
50 ns to 1 μs in steps of 50 ns and the broadcast loss rates between
the laptops connected to the emulator is measured. Figure 7 shows
the variation of loss rates with delay spread.
Figure 7 shows that narrower channels are more resilient to higher
delay spreads. It plots as a function of the conﬁgured delay spread
the loss rate of different channel widths. We see that 40 MHz is
resilient upto about 150 ns delay spread, whereas 5 MHz can with-
stand about 400 ns. Based on the typical numbers above, we esti-
mate that only 5 MHz is likely to work well outdoors.
3.3 Energy Consumption
We now quantify the effect of channel width on power consump-
tion using a setup similar to the one used in [20]. We connect a 0.1
ohm resistor in series with the wireless card, and measure the cur-
rent drawn through the resistor using a data acquisition system. We
compute the power consumed by the wireless card by multiplying
the current drawn through the resistor with the voltage supply of
the wireless card (5 Volts).
