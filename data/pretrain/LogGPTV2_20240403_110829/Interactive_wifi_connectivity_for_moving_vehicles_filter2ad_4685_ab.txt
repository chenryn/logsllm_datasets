ten marred by gray periods where connection quality drops sharply.
Gray periods are unpredictable and occur even close to BSes. With
BRR, the clients often ﬁnd themselves experiencing a gray period
with respect to the associated BS, which causes frequent disrup-
tions in connectivity. But because they tend to be short-lived, gray
periods do not severely impact aggregate performance. We have an-
alyzed gray periods in our testbeds in more detail [3, 24] but omit
that analysis from this paper.
Figure 3(d) quantitatively compares the handoff policies with re-
spect to the cumulative time clients spend in an uninterrupted ses-
sion of a given length. We see that the median session length of
AllBSes is more than twice that of BestBS and more than seven
times that of the more practical BRR. This suggests that a prac-
tical, multi-BS handoff policy can achieve signiﬁcant gains over
hard handoff.
To investigate how applications with different requirements can
be supported, we now explore other deﬁnitions of adequate con-
nectivity. Figure 4(a) varies the averaging interval while keeping
the minimum reception ratio requirement ﬁxed at 50%; Figure 4(b)
varies the minimum reception ratio while keeping the averaging in-
terval ﬁxed at one second. A longer averaging interval represents
less stringent requirements because the session is said to be inter-
rupted only if there is no activity for a longer period. Similarly,
a shorter reception ratio represents a weaker requirement. The re-
sults suggest that when the requirements are less stringent all meth-
ods other than Sticky perform similarly. But as the requirements

become more demanding the relative advantage of using multiple
BSes increases. The right end of Figure 4(b) does not represent
convergence but a degenerate point where the requirements are so
strict that all methods have short sessions.
3.4 Why is using multiple BSes effective?
We now explain why AllBSes is signiﬁcantly more effective than
using only one BS even when that BS is judiciously chosen. We
show that its effectiveness stems from two factors: (i) the vehicle
is often in range of multiple BSes; (ii) packet losses are bursty and
roughly independent across senders and receivers. In the next sec-
tion, we leverage these ﬁndings in the design of ViFi.
3.4.1 Extent of diversity
To exploit BS diversity, a vehicle must be in range of multiple
BSes on the same channel. As shown in Figure 5, this is true not
only in VanLAN, which we have deployed, but also in DieselNet.
The graphs plot the CDF of the number of BSes from which the
vehicles hear beacons in one-second intervals. Our results are con-
sistent with measurements in other cities [8]. While future deploy-
ments may be engineered for diversity (§6), we ﬁnd sufﬁcient di-
versity even in existing deployments.
In separate experiments (not shown here), to understand the ex-
tent of diversity actually needed, we ﬁnd that using as few as two
BSes brings most of the gain and there is no additional beneﬁt to
using more than three. A similar observation holds for cellular net-
works [37].

3.4.2 The nature of losses
Diversity can effectively tackle losses in the vehicular environ-
ment. In the upstream direction, diversity is effective because losses
are roughly independent across BSes and a packet sent by the vehi-
cle is received by at least one BS with a high probability. In other
words, the fact that a packet from the vehicle is lost at, for instance,
the closest BS, has little bearing on whether it is lost at another BS.
This independence of losses at receivers has been shown previously
for outdoor WiFi meshes [5]. We ﬁnd that it holds in our setting as
well but omit detailed results.
Diversity is effective in the downstream direction because it can
tackle bursty losses better than single-BS systems [25]. Figure 6(a)
shows evidence that losses are bursty in the vehicular setting. The
ﬁgure plots the probability of losing the packet (i+k) from a BS to
vehicle in VanLAN given that packet i was lost. In this experiment,
a single BS sends packets every 10 ms; we pick a different sending
BS for each trip by the vehicle. The probability of losing a packet
immediately after a loss is much higher than the overall loss prob-
ability. Thus, even when a vehicle is associated to a BS with a low
average loss rate, it can lose many packets in a small time period,
hurting interactive applications.
Diversity helps overcome burst losses because when the vehicle
is in a burst-loss phase with one BS a second BS can deliver pack-
ets to it. That is, most burst losses are path dependent (e.g., due
to multipath fading) rather than receiver dependent. Figure 6(b)
shows evidence that this holds for the vehicular environment and
quantiﬁes the effect for one pair of chosen BSes in VanLAN. Each
BS sends a packet every 20 ms. P (A) and P (B) are the uncondi-
tional downstream packet reception probabilities from BSes A and
B. P (Ai+1|¬Ai) is the conditional reception probability of receiv-
ing (i+1)-th packet from A given that the i-th packet from A was
lost. Other probabilities can be similarly interpreted. We see that
after a loss from a BS, the reception probability of the next packet
from it is very low. But the second BS’s probability of delivering
the next packet is only slightly lower than its unconditional loss
probability.
4. ViFi DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
In this section, we present ViFi, a protocol designed to minimize
disruptions in connectivity between moving vehicles and a network
of BSes. We focus on improving the underlying link-layer connec-
tivity. In some environments, providing continuous connectivity to
applications may also require higher-layer techniques, for instance,
to handle IP address changes; for these, we rely on existing solu-
tions [35, 30].
4.1 Target environment
the following characteristics.
The design of ViFi assumes that its operating environment has
• Diversity: A packet sent by a moving vehicle can often be
heard by multiple BSes, and multiple BSes can often deliver
packets to a moving vehicle. This assumption is fundamen-
tal for leveraging BS diversity. It is not necessary that the
reception rate between the vehicle and each BS be high.
• Bandwidth-limited inter-BS communication: The BSes can
communicate with each other. However, in WiFi deploy-
ments today, inter-BS communication tends to be based on
relatively thin broadband links or a multi-hop wireless mesh.
Accordingly, we assume that inter-BS communication is band-
width constrained.
We also assume that some of the nearby BSes can overhear each
other over the vehicle-BS channel. This assumption is not strictly
necessary. For example, the functionality can be fulﬁlled using the
inter-BS backplane.
4.2 Goals and approach
Motivated by the effectiveness of AllBSes, which itself is imprac-
tical, we seek to develop a protocol that leverages BS diversity to
reduce disruptions. The key challenge is in coordinating among the
BSes such that the coordination scheme: (i) imposes minimal addi-
tional load on the inter-BS and vehicle-BS communication media;
(ii) does not increase per packet latency, as that hurts interactive
applications; (iii) can handle rapidly changing sets of BSes.
Other works that leverage diversity in WiFi networks either as-
sume a high-speed inter-BS backplane [26, 25] or batch packets to
amortize overhead [5, 9]. In our setting, however, high-capacity
backplane is often not available. We also cannot use batching be-
cause that increases latency for packets.
Our approach is to leverage opportunistic receptions by nearby
BSes, followed by probabilistic relaying. Opportunistic receptions
provide a low-overhead but unreliable means for disseminating in-
formation. With probabilistic relaying, each BS relays based on
an independently computed relaying probability, which avoids the
need for explicit coordination messages between BSes. The result-
ing protocol is lightweight and decentralized.
Another aspect of ViFi that differs from traditional WiFi hand-
off is salvaging, in which BSes attempt to save packets that are
stranded at old BSes when the vehicle moves away.
4.3 Protocol overview
In ViFi, the vehicle designates one of the nearby BSes as the
anchor. The anchor can be selected using any of the association
methods that clients use today to pick a BS. Our implementation
uses BRR. The anchor is responsible for the vehicle’s connection to
the Internet—packets from the vehicle are forwarded through the
anchor and packets from the Internet destined for the vehicle ﬁrst
arrive at the anchor. A client acquires its IP address from the anchor
BS, if needed.
The vehicle designates other nearby BSes as auxiliary. We cur-
rently pick all BSes that the vehicle hears as auxiliaries. In certain
environments, such as those that are highly dense, the list of auxil-
iaries may need to be more carefully selected.
The vehicle embeds the identity of the current anchor and aux-
iliary BSes in the beacons that it broadcasts periodically. Beacons
enable all nearby BSes to learn the current anchor and the set of
auxiliary BSes. Thus, changes to the identity of the anchor or the
set of auxiliary BSes are communicated to the BSes by the vehicle
at the beaconing frequency. The vehicle also embeds the identity
of the previous anchor for salvaging (§4.5).
The operation of ViFi is symmetric in both directions and is de-
scribed below in terms of the source, src, and destination, dst, of the
transfer. In the upstream direction, the vehicle is the source and the
anchor is the destination. The roles are reversed in the downstream
direction.

src transmits the packet P .
If dst receives P , it broadcasts an ACK.
If an auxiliary overhears P , but within a small window
has not heard an ACK, it probabilistically relays P .
If dst receives relayed P and has not already sent an
ACK, it broadcasts an ACK.
If src does not receive an ACK within a retransmission
interval, it retransmits P .
Upstream packets are relayed on the inter-BS backplane and down-
stream packets on the vehicle-BS channel. A packet is considered
for relaying only once, and packets overheard from other auxil-
iary BSes are not relayed. In Step 3, the overheard ACK that sup-
presses relaying by an auxiliary BS could be in response to either
the source’s transmission or a relayed transmission by another aux-
iliary BS.
It is instructive to understand why relaying by an auxiliary BS
is better than a retransmission by the source itself. The ﬁrst reason
is that losses are bursty—if the original was lost, there is a high
chance that an immediate retransmission will be lost as well. After
a loss, other nodes are better positioned to deliver the packet to the
destination (§3.4.2). An additional reason in the upstream direction
is that relaying uses the inter-BS communication plane, which in
many cases will be more reliable than the vehicle-BS channel.
4.4 Computing relaying probability
The key challenge in computing relaying probability for auxil-
iary BSes is to balance the trade-off between too few and too many
relayed transmissions. With the former, the performance will de-
grade to that of no diversity; the latter will lead to excessive load
on the vehicle-BS and inter-BS communication mediums.
The relay probability computation in ViFi is based on the follow-
ing guidelines.
