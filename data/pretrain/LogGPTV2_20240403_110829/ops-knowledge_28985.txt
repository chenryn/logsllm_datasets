**User:**
Does anyone know how to achieve enhanced IntelliSense-like functionality in Eclipse for Python development? I am currently using Eclipse 3.5 with Aptana and PyDev, and my Python interpreter is version 2.5.2.

**Assistant:**
I am using Eclipse 3.6 along with PyDev and Python 2.6, and it provides the best autocompletion experience I have encountered so far. While I haven't tested Eclipse 3.5, I can say that the autocompletion in Eclipse 3.6 with PyDev is quite robust compared to other free alternatives I have tried. I have not evaluated any paid options, so I cannot compare them to my current setup.
