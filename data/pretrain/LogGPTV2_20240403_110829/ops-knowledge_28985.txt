User: Does anyone know how to get an intellisense like functionality (better than default) in eclipse for python development? I am using Eclipse 3.5 with aptana and pydev and the interpreter is python 2.5.2
Assistant: I'm using eclipse 3.6 and pydev with python 2.6 and it's the best one I've tested up to now. I didn't try 3.5 so not sure if it's the same as yours but I think it autocompletes well compared to others I tried but I didn't try any of the paid ones.
