Before we get started…
Con Speaker Rule 101
If you’re naming vendors and 
don’t want your talk pulled,
even if it’s already known
and even if the impact is low,
don’t disclose too much ahead of time.
TL;dr
• Bluetooth -> All the things!
• Wireless Security Products -> CCTV LOLZ
• Consumer Windows Install -> Whoops
• Q&A after talk
3 Topics in One Talk?
• Keep it close to 20 minutes
• So 15+15+15 = 45! MATH!
• Also squirel.
Bluetooth all the things!
Another Bluetooth Talk?
• BlueHydra* - Zero_Chaos & Granolocks
• BLE Locks From Miles Away – Rose & Ramsey
• BLE GATT Proxy Tool – Jasek
• BLE-REPLAY & BLESUITE - Foringer & Trabun
So what’s different here?
“Rules”
• Never reveal the secret
• Never repeat a trick for 
the same audience
• Practice. Over and Over.

How do you wirelessly ID someone?
• Car on the way in?
• ALPR
• ETC RFID
• Bluetooth
• Came in by foot?
• Facial Recognition
• Voice Recognition
• Cell Phone?
• WiFi
• Bluetooth
• IMSI Catcher
• Proximity
• Credit Card RFID
• Car Keys RFID
• Work badges
• The not fancy ways
• Reservation Names
• RFID Loyalty cards
• Credit cards
• Social engineering

Say it isn't so!
Wifi caught on to this
• iOS8 and Android 6.0
• Historical SSIDs identify real mac
• Take it as a data point, but not trust it
That leaves us with

I’m Blue (dabadeedabad1e)
• Bluetooth Classic
• 79+1 1Mhz Channels, 1600 hops/second
• NAP + UAP and LAP make up hop sequence
• LAP is included in every message
• We know this. Duh. But many personal devices are now 
Bluetooth Smart (except for headsets/headphones).
• BLE (Bluetooth Smart)
• 37+3 2Mhz Channels, Interval/Increment/Channels is 
dictated by master upon connection.
• 4 byte access address
• 6 byte mac address in advertising announcements
Bluetooth Has Security Too?
Access Address?
• Address used once connected.
• Change upon disconnect/reconnect
• Long term tracking is not reliable
• Provides as good of short term tracking 
as random broadcast mac addresses, but 
applies to connected devices.
GAP and GATT
• Generic Access Profile
• Generic Attribute Profile
• Long story short, methods for sharing 
info about the connection or devices.
In Preparation For Takeoff
• Why are all these new 
devices advertising?
• Wait a second…
• if (paired == FALSE) 
ble.mode(“advertise”)
Can we disconnect BLE?
• Hell yes we can (momentarily and 
proximity dependent)
• USRP b210 = 56mhz bandwidth
• BLE = 80mhz, minus 6mhz broadcast
• 50-75% coverage
• So jam 2428 to 2478 Mhz…
• GNURadio + Rand Noise = some success
• Depending on the host, odd reliability
Option 2 – Spoof Disconnect
• Blast LL_TERMINATE_IND Control Packet
• Have to sniff the Access Address first 
and catch it on the right channel / right 
time
• Some devices don’t take kindly to this 
and won’t reconnect well
We’ve talked about tracking 
before, right?
• Sort Of?
• Focused on “it’s possible”, but not 
researching specific device behaviors.
Leaves us With 
Implementation Issues
Hello Amazon/Best Buy
Pavlok
• Static Mac
• Mac in Name (Pavlok-XXXX)
• Serial is its mac, also 
available via GATT in case you 
didn’t have it already in 
ascii->hex
Trackr
• Effectively Static Mac 
Address
• Manufacturer Data In 
broadcast = MAC
• Broadcasts Constantly
Tile
• Effectively Static Mac 
Address
• “Tile Identifier” in GATT
• Stays connected…only while 
app is open.
Fitbit One
• Randomized Mac, but 
effectively static after >4
months
• Doesn’t remain connected, so 
it broadcasts
Withings Active
• Mac Randomizes
• But…Advertises MAC as 
Manufacturer Data in 
Advertisement Data (ADV_IND)
Pebble Steel
• 2 Bytes of MAC in Manufacturer 
Name - “Pebble Time LE XXXX”
• Says Mac is random, but after 
days was still the same even 
after reboots
• Serial Number in Device Info
• Goes to sleep every so often
• Uses both Classic and BLE
Fitbit Alta
• Randomized Mac, but 
effectively static after >4
months and battery loss
• Unlike the one, stays 
connected for notifications
Garmin vivofit
• Static Mac, but…
• Bluetooth only works when 
in a “sync” mode.
Microsoft Band 2
• Dynamic Mac on reboot
• “’s Band  LE” 
as device name
Apple Watch
• Dynamic Mac
• Maintains dynamic mac 
between disconnects
• Rotates appear time based, 
but not 100% sure how often
Huawei Watch
• Android Wear
• Random Mac, and doesn’t 
respond to BLE broadcasts
iOS Devices
• BLE for Safari?!?
• Other Apps Too
• Does randomize heavily, and 
while it announces it as an 
i, no trackability
So who’s doing it right?
• Apple Watch
• Android Wear
• iOS Itself
Tool?
• This is where we were going to release a 
tool to track LAP / BLE Access Addresses 
/ BLE Broadcast MACs
• BlueHydra totally one upped us, and we 
had no idea...
• Go try it out and contribute (we will be)
Where do we go from here?
• We need to continue to test devices to 
document the implementation issues when 
it comes to bluetooth device privacy.
• github.com/urbanesec/bledevices
Tl;dr?
• When MACs are random, look for:
• Lack of randomization, even if it says it is.
• GAPs leaking serials
• GATTs leaking serials
• Device Names
• You can deauth BLE devices to get some to 
respond to advertisement channel requests to 
get advertisement addresses (MACs).
• While the standard supports it, devices don’t.
