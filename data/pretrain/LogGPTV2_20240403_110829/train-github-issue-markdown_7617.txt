As far as I can tell the `runtime` transform is all-or-nothing, all I'm
interested in is getting rid of the redundant helpers inlined into every
module, but it seems I can't have that without also the "risk" of getting
dependencies on the other runtimes (notably `core-js`).
Have I missed something or would it not make sense to have a separate
transform for just this? They seem to have rather separate concerns from my
perspective (avoid redundant helper code vs add dependencies for optional
features).
