**Discussion:**

Innovations that do not alter quality under monitoring (m) are inherently challenging to support, as they remain undetectable by the monitoring system. In this context, path monitoring becomes increasingly important, as it is the only method to ensure that data reaches specific innovative ISPs. Further research is necessary to fully understand this process.

**Proof of Claim 4:**

Label the nodes as 1, 2, ..., N in the order in which they select contracts. Let subgame \( n \) be the game that begins with node \( n \) choosing its contract. Define \( L_n \) as the set of possible paths restricted to nodes \( n, \ldots, N \). That is, \( L_n \) represents the set of possible routes from the source \( S \) to reach a node that has already made its move.

For subgame \( n \), define the local welfare over paths as follows:
\[ T(n) = \sum_{p \in L_n} \left( \frac{p_l}{p_1 - p_l} \right) \]

This can be rearranged to give:
\[ T(n) = \sum_{p \in L_n} \left( \frac{p_l}{p_1 - p_l} \right) \]

The rest of the claim simply recognizes that \( T(n) \) is the maximum reward node \( i \) can receive for its investment, so it will not invest sums greater than this, as required.

\[
\begin{aligned}
T(n) &= \sum_{p \in L_n} \left( \frac{p_l}{p_1 - p_l} \right) \\
&= \sum_{p \in L_n} \left( \frac{p_l}{p_1 - p_l} \right) \times \left( \frac{p_2 - p_l}{p_2 - p_l} \right) \times \left( \frac{p_3 - p_l}{p_3 - p_l} \right) \times \cdots \\
&= \sum_{p \in L_n} \left( \frac{p_l}{p_1 - p_l} \right) \times \left( \frac{p_2 - p_l}{p_2 - p_l} \right) \times \left( \frac{p_3 - p_l}{p_3 - p_l} \right) \times \cdots
\end{aligned}
