Clearly,  innovations  that  leave  quality  invariant  under  m  are  not 
easy to support – they are invisible to the monitoring system.  In this 
environment,  we  expect  that  path  monitoring  becomes  more 
important,  since  it  is  the  only  way  to  ensure  data  reaches  certain 
innovator  ISPs.    Further  research  is  needed  to  understand  this 
process.

Proof of Claim 4.  Label the nodes 1,2,.. N in the order in which 
they select contracts.  Let subgame n be the game that begins with n 
choosing its contract.  Let Ln be the set of possible paths restricted to 
nodes  n,…,N.    That  is,  Ln  is  the  set  of  possible  routes  from  S  to 
reach some node that has already moved. 
For subgame n, define the local welfare over paths 
possible next hops,
