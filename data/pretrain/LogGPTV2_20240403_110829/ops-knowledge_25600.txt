Verify that all servers have solid firewall and intrusion detection programs, and that they are regularly updated. 3. Confirm the correctness of access control policies and permission configurations to ensure that only authorized users can access servers and applications. 4. Set up security logging and review these logs periodically to check for unusual activity. 5. Regularly conduct vulnerability scanning to ensure that vulnerabilities in servers and applications are discovered and repaired in a timely manner. 6. Create a strong password policy and require users to update their passwords regularly. 7. Implement multiple layers of security controls, such as encrypted links, integrity checks, and authentication measures. 8. Make regular backups to ensure application recovery in case of application or server failure. Update Process: 1. Regularly check for new patches and security updates, and test them 2. Test patches and security updates in a test environment before production environments. 3. Arrange the update time and notify users in advance before the update. 4. Download and install patches and security updates, and check that they are properly installed and effective. 5. Verify that patches and security updates have no side effects and that the application is still functioning properly. 6. After the update, perform relevant security tests to ensure that there are no new vulnerabilities in the application.
