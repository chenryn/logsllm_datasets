User: On a server with multiple network cards, how to set one of the network cards as the default network card?
Assistant: You can set one of the network cards as the default network card by modifying the network configuration file: 1. Use the command `ifconfig` or `ip addr` to view the network card information on the current server, and find the name of the network card you want to set as the default network card. 2. Use an editor to open the configuration file corresponding to the network card in the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*` directory, such as `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`. 3. Find and modify the following two parameters in the configuration file: ```bash BOOTPROTO=static # Set the network card to static IP mode ONBOOT=yes # Set the network card to be automatically enabled when the system starts``` 4. If you want to use the network card Set as the default network card, you can set the `GATEWAY` parameter of the network card to the IP address of the gateway: ```bash GATEWAY=192.168.1.1 # Set the default gateway of the network card to 192.168.1.1 ``` 5. Save the configuration after modification file, use the `systemctl restart network` command to restart the network service to make the modification take effect. 6. Finally, you can use the `route` command to confirm whether the default network card is set successfully.
