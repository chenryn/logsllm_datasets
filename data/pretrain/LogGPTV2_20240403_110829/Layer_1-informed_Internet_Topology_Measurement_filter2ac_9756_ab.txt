• regular expression patterns to extract the location code
from DNS entries. The location code is that part of the
hostname that contains location data. For example, for
A.B.C.LAX2.D.NET, the location code is LAX, which is
the airport code for Los Angeles, CA, USA;
• mapping codes [12] to translate location code ob-
tained from DNS entries to physical location (a lati-
tude/longitude pair);
• the list of nodes (along with each corresponding DNS
entry) obtained by parsing the traceroute data from Ark
as described above;
• and the list of links obtained by parsing the traceroute
data from Ark, also as described above.
Using these inputs, we associate physical
locations to
the IP addresses in the interface list using the following
steps:
• First, we match the domain names against the regular
expression location patterns and extract a location code
from every entry.
• Next, we translate the location code to an actual physi-
cal location using the mapping codes. The result of this
second step is that we have location information asso-
ciated with every interface IP address that has a DNS
entry with location hints embedded in it. We also use
Team Cymru’s IP-to-ASN mapping service [3] to classify
the list of nodes and links into diﬀerent ISPs based on
the Autonomous System (AS) Numbers.
At the end of applying this algorithm we have network-
layer maps for diﬀerent autonomous systems in which the
nodes refer to geographic locations of POPs, and links refer
to the fact that packets can be forwarded between a pair
of POPs. Note that we do not consider intra-POP links,
or individual routers in POPs. The result is that we have
a network-layer map that can be equitably compared with
the physical map available from Internet Atlas.

4.2 How are POPs in the same city identiﬁed?
To identify POPs located within the same city, we leverage
three types of information: (1) Personal email communica-
tion with network operators and administrators who run the
ISPs, (2) IP address allocation information from publicly
available databases like PeeringDB, and (3) naming conven-
tions recorded from ISP websites. In what follows, we give
a list of examples for all three cases.
• Tinet (now Intelliquent) has multiple POPs at multiple
cities. To identify those POP locations, we contacted
one of the network operators [16] from Tinet and identi-
ﬁed the naming convention followed by them — the ﬁrst
three letters are city code, and next digit is location code.
For instance, ams10 and ams20 are two diﬀerent POPs in
Amsterdam.
• Another reliable source of information that is frequently
updated and maintained by network operators is Peer-
ingDB. Apart from providing the list of peers at a partic-
ular facility (or an IXP), PeeringDB also provides infor-
mation like address space allocation, network operator
contacts, etc. For instance, GTT has multiple POP lo-
cations in New York. One of them peers at NYIIX and
has 198.32.160.0/24 as its address space, and one an-
other POP peers at Coresite NY with 206.51.45.0/24
as its address space.
• ISPs routinely publish their naming conventions in their
websites along with inter-city POP details. For instance,
Lumos Networks and Atlantic Metro Communications
publicly list all inter-city POP naming conventions [6,7].
4.3 Associating Geographic Locations with
Traceroute Data
We ﬁrst provide details on results from processing the
traceroute data used for building network-layer topologies.
Over the 19 months of Ark data considered in our study,
we identiﬁed 14,593,457 unique interface IP addresses, com-
prising 31,055 unique ASes. On these traceroute mea-
surements, we applied the algorithm described above to
construct network-layer topologies for comparison with the
physical networks chosen for our study. Table 2 shows sev-
eral statistics resulting from applying our algorithm.
As shown in Table 2, there were a number of situations
in which we could not reliably use the traceroute data for
building network-layer topologies. In particular, over 13M
IP addresses did not have an associated DNS name with

any (obvious) location information embedded in it3, which
represents 95.16% of all IP addresses observed in our data.
Of these, over 6M were unusable because of DNS resolu-
tion failures, e.g., fail.non-authoritative.in-addr.arpa,
which represented 40.31% of all IP addresses observed in
our data. While these results certainly limit our ability to
compare physical and network-layer topologies for all net-
works, the remaining “usable” trace information represents
4,135 separate autonomous systems, which we argue still
represents a signiﬁcant slice of the Internet.
An issue we encountered when applying the algorithm of
Section 4.1 was that, in some cases, there were no asso-
ciated AS numbers indicated by the Team Cymru IP-to-
AS mapping service or available in other whois databases.
For such networks, we used a manual keyword search (e.g.,
layer42.net refers to the Layer42 ISP), which was eﬀective
for subnets with at least one associated DNS entry.
5. COMPARING LAYER 1 MAPS WITH
LAYER 3 PROBE DATA
In this section, we analyze the physical and network-layer
topology data. We begin with comparing the two views of
Internet topology by considering how each view intersects
and diﬀers from one another, and also how the two views
of network topology reinforce each other. We focus our dis-
cussion on 50 regional and national ISPs with footprints in
North America. We focus on these particular networks be-
the DNS naming

data regarding POPs and inter-POP links for these ISPs.
5.1 Comparison of Physical and Network-
layer Nodes and Links
We now compare the physical and network-layer topolo-
gies obtained from the Atlas data and the Ark data, respec-
tively. Again, the basic entities we compare are nodes, which
represent city-level points of presence or data centers, and
links, which represent physical and/or logical connectivity
between two city-level POPs.
Table 6 in Appendix A shows the number of nodes and
links observed in each topology type, for each of the 50
networks under study. We ﬁrst see that while all physi-
cal networks have non-zero nodes and links, there are some
network-layer topologies for which there are zero nodes
and/or links observed. There are two reasons for this. First,
an interface IP address for a given network may have no clear
location information embedded in its associated DNS entry.
For example, for 21 out of 50 networks, there were no lo-
cation hints observable in the related DNS records. This
result may be because of non-obvious naming conventions,
or simply that there are no name records available. We note
that although some ISPs in our list of 50 have been acquired
by other companies, the AS number and address blocks as-
signed to these companies still refer to the original ISP 4.
The second reason we may observe zero nodes and/or links
for a given network is that we may simply not have observed
any interface addresses for a given network in 19 months of
traceroute data. This observation was true for 16 out of the
50 networks included in our study. Considering the fact that
the Ark project targets every routable /24 in the IPv4 Inter-
net, this is a surprising result. Still, there may be a variety
of reasons for this observation. First, some ISPs may conﬁg-
ure their routers not to respond to hop-limited probes with
ICMP time exceeded messages (resulting in “stars” in the
traceroute output). Second, some networks may use tunnel-
ing protocols such as MPLS, and conﬁgure these tunnels to
be completely hidden. Third, there may be interfaces con-
trolled by an ISP under study that are conﬁgured with IP
addresses from a third party, e.g., an IXP. In the end, we
were left with 13 networks that had DNS entries for which
we could identify a physical location.
To assess how the physical and network-layer views of a
network compare, we consider node and link intersection,
as well as the number of nodes and links only observed in
one or other other topology. To determine the intersection,
we consider a node to intersect each topology if we identify
the same POP location in each one. We consider a link
to intersect each topology if there are POPs identiﬁed in
the same two locations in each topology and there is a link
identiﬁed between them. For example, if we observe nodes in
Chicago and Kansas City in both the physical and network-
layer topologies for a given ISP, and a link between those
two cities, we say the link and two nodes intersect.
Table 6 in Appendix A shows results from the intersection
analysis. We also show in the table nodes or links that only
appear in one or the other topology. We see that, in gen-
eral, there are more nodes and links observed in the physical
4For example, although BellSouth was acquired by AT&T
in 2006, the name BellSouth is still referred to in whois
databases and appears in recent address block usage reports
(http://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/).
topologies than are seen in the network-layer topologies. For
the networks for which this observation holds, the number
of nodes and links observed is, in some cases, signiﬁcantly
larger than those seen using the traceroute data. These re-
sults strongly suggest that sole reliance on layer 3 probes
to generate physical network maps is likely to result in an
incomplete view of Internet topology. On the other hand,
the table shows that there are a small number of networks
in which we observe more nodes and links in the network-
layer topology. In particular, we see this for AT&T, Tinet,
NTT, Sprint, Layer42, and Hurricane Electric (abbreviated
as HE in the table). This observation suggests that while
published physical maps usually oﬀer an authoritative view
of physical infrastructure, the published maps may lag re-
cent deployments which can be observed through layer 3
probing.
More broadly, analysis of the Ark traces shows that there
are at least 448 distinct networks in North America (that are
not part of Atlas). This number is identiﬁed by ﬁrst search-
ing for all North American location DNS hints and then
identifying unique service providers in the DNS names. This
compares to the 320 distinct networks in the Atlas reposi-
tory, which have been identiﬁed through extensive search-
based methods. An implication for this diﬀerence is that
measurements from Ark can be used as guidance for identi-
fying service provider networks that could be included in At-
las. For example, many small/regional networks like Adera
Networks (CA), Grande Communications (TX) and Atala
T (NY) were found in the traces of Ark and such networks
could be incorporated into future search-based campaigns.
Of the 448 distinct networks identiﬁed through Ark mea-
surements, the vast majority of probes pass through tier-1
and major ISPs, as shown in Figure 1. Thus, while it is
likely that the POP-level topology of well-connected ISPs
can be largely identiﬁed through general probing techniques,
smaller ISPs are unlikely to be well-mapped. This observa-
tion is supported by prior studies on sampling bias in net-
work topology measurements (e.g., [39]). An implication for
this observation is that targeted probing methods may be nec-
essary to obtain a more comprehensive topological picture
of physical Internet infrastructure.
Lastly, we consider one form of validation of physical node
locations when we observe the same location for nodes in
more than one network. We deﬁne the metric NIndex as
the percentage of nodes identiﬁed for a given network that
have the same physical location as a node in another net-
work. The right-most column of Table 6 in Appendix A
shows the NIndex for each network. The intuition for why
this metric provides some level of validation of the physi-
cal location has to do with common industry practices of
using co-location facilities and telecom hotels. While this
observation may not hold universally, we believe that co-
location practices are generally observed for small regional
networks in geographically isolated areas since the costs as-
sociated with setting up new facilities is high. For instance,
larger national ISPs like Layer42, Napnet, Navigata and Ne-
trail show an NIndex of 100 (complete overlap with nodes in
other networks), whereas smaller regional cariers such as
NetworkUSA, RedBestel and Syringa5 show an NIndex less
than 20 (mostly their own locations). The combination of
5NetworkUSA is a regional carrier serving Louisiana,
RedBestel operates in the Guadalajara region of Mexico,
and Syringa is a regional carrier in Idaho.

gets for additional probing in order to broaden the scope
of the resulting network-layer maps.
5.2 Case study: Tinet
Tinet represented an interesting special case: the phys-
ical topology contained nodes not present in the network-
layer topology, and the network-layer topology also con-
tained nodes not present in the physical topology. In partic-
ular, there were 65 nodes only present in the physical topol-
ogy, and 7 nodes that were only observed in the Ark data
and network-layer topology. For example, the Tinet physi-
cal network map shows four nodes for Amsterdam, Nether-
lands, one node in San Jose, CA, two nodes in Milan, Italy
and two nodes in Washington, DC. However, the network-
layer topology revealed additional nodes for these locations.
The missing nodes from the physical network may be due
to Tinet’s network maps not reﬂecting the most up-to-date
deployments. Missing nodes and links in the network-layer
view may be due to a variety of reasons, including the in-
ability to gain a broad perspective on Tinet’s network from
Ark vantage points. What these results indicate is that to
gain a complete view of a network’s topology, multiple data
sources must be considered.
5.3 Main ﬁndings and implications
The main ﬁndings of our comparison of physical and
network-layer topologies are as follows.
• We observe many more nodes and links in the physical
maps, which may be due to a variety of reasons, but
is most critically due to the fact that layer 3 routing
conﬁgurations simply eliminate the possibility to observe
all networks, nodes, and links through end-to-end prob-
ing. This likelihood is supported by the fact that all Ark
probes are limited to a relatively small subset of net-
works, with the majority of probes passing through an
even smaller set of networks.
• There are still some nodes, locations, and links that ap-
pear in the network-layer map but are not observed in
physical maps. The likely reason is that the physical
maps are out of date or incomplete.
• The observed diﬀerences between the physical and
network-layer maps suggest opportunities for using one
to reinforce the other. In particular, networks observed
in Ark that do not appear in Atlas oﬀer clues for search-
ing for new maps to expand Atlas. Similarly, nodes or
links in Atlas that do not appear in Ark can become tar-
Indeed, in the next section we focus speciﬁcally on how to
emit targeted layer 3 probes in order to conﬁrm the existence
of nodes identiﬁed in physical maps, as well as to identify
additional physical nodes.
6. EFFECTS OF VANTAGE POINTS ON
NODE IDENTIFICATION
In this
section, we examine the eﬀects of
source-
destination selection on the ability to identify POPs within
a service provider using targeted layer 3 probes. Speciﬁcally,
we examine the diﬀerences between using vantage points
(probing sources) internal or external to an ISP containing
target POP(s), and destinations either internal or external
to the ISP. Furthermore, we examine the eﬀects that IXPs
may have on probe-based POP identiﬁcation and how IXP
placement may be exploited to aid in node identiﬁcation by
providing a larger set of internal vantage points.
6.1 Effects of vantage point and destination
selection
To examine the impact of vantage point and destination
IP address selection for identifying all target POPs in an
ISP, we leverage publicly available traceroute servers, look-
ing glass servers and Planetlab nodes as VPs6, and select
diﬀerent combinations of them located within or external
to diﬀerent service providers.
In particular, we use three
combinations: probing from VPs outside an ISP to des-
tinations inside (denoted V Pout to tin), from VPs inside
an ISP to destinations outside (denoted V Pin to tout) and
from VPs inside an ISP and destinations inside (denoted
V Pin to tin). For each directional modality (V Pout → tin,
V Pin → tout, V Pin → tin), we use a greedy approach to
identify probe source-destination pairs based on geographic
proximity. We choose the VP geographically closest to a tar-
get POP, then successively choose from the set of destina-
tions that are also geographically proximal to the target until
the target is identiﬁed. For instance, a probe from planet-
lab4.wail.wisc.edu to 184.105.184.1587 with the aim to
identify Hurricane Electric’s POP in Los Angeles identiﬁed
two additional POPs (in Chicago and Denver) in addition
to identifying the Los Angeles POP. If we can not identify

closest VP, and so forth (speciﬁc details of this method are
provided in Section 7).
Using a subset of 25 ISP networks that assign DNS names
with location hints and that contain 596 target POPs, we
analyze the source-destination combinations. Figure 2 shows
the fraction of target POPs discovered by these three prob-
ing modalities relative to the number of POPs identiﬁed in
Atlas. The ﬁgure shows clearly that the most eﬀective strat-
egy is to send probes from vantage points located within an
ISP to destinations that are also within the ISP (V Pin to
tin). We further observe that using a VP located within an
ISP is more eﬀective than choosing one external to the ISP.
We hypothesize that these diﬀerences are due to the eﬀects
of interdomain versus intradomain routing on probes. In the
case of both VP and destination located within an ISP, there
is a greater chance for a diversity of paths to be observed
due to ECMP, the fact that more information about short-
est paths is available, and the greater degree of ﬂexibility
that a service provider has in routing packets within its own
infrastructure. In the case of either VP or destination being
external to the ISP that contains a target POP, interdomain
routing protocol eﬀects come into play, such as hot-potato
routing and the forced choice of a single best path.
Lastly, we note that in absolute numbers, we observed a
total of 188 POPs using V Pin to tin, 157 POPs via V Pin to
tout, and 93 with V Pout to tin. For 11 networks we observed
zero POPs. Similar to our earlier observations in which we
do not see POPs identiﬁed in physical maps, this may be
due to MPLS deployments, traﬃc management policies, or
routing policies. We intend to further investigate the reason
for the invisibility of POPs in future work.
6.2 Using IXPs to expand perspective
Given the result that the most eﬀective probing strategy
for identifying physical infrastructure is to choose source-
destination pairs that are within an ISP, it is important to
recognize that broad deployment of such targeted measure-
ments is inherently limited by the availability of VPs within
provider networks. Indeed, the 266 VPs used in this paper
are restricted to 248 separate networks, which is substan-
tially less than the total number of networks identiﬁed in
North America by Ark in Section 5.
Recent work in [10] has highlighted the enormous amount
of layer 2 peering that is taking place at IXPs. This leads us
to posit that VPs co-located with IXPs might be leveraged
to dramatically expand our ability to identify physical in-
frastructure. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that much
of the rapid growth in peering at IXPs is being driven by lo-
cal and regional ISPs and that Tier-1 ISPs have been slower
to connect [27]. This oﬀers a tantalizing opportunity since
it is generally the smaller networks that are more diﬃcult to
map and those networks often do not deploy looking glass
servers that are necessary for mapping physical infrastruc-
ture.
To consider this possibility, we begin by looking for VPs
that are co-located with IXPs in North America. We ﬁnd
that 14 out of 65 IXPs have co-located VPs. Using Peer-
ingDB [5] we ﬁnd that the total number of unique ISPs that
peer at these 14 IXPs is 642. A comparison between these
ISPs and those in with VPs used in our study shows that
an additional 625 unique networks could be measured from
these 14 IXPs alone. This suggests that deployment of VPs
in other IXPs could be the starting point for comprehensive
mapping of physical Internet infrastructure.
6.3 Main ﬁndings and implications
In summary, we consider how to choose sources and desti-
