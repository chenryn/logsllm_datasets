large packets, they both utilize more than 90% of the link
bandwidth. In practice, the packet overhead becomes neg-
ligible since as small packets account for less than 10% of
bandwidth and most of remaining packets are full sized [2].
8. DISCUSSION
Inter-TD traﬃc guarantees. While STRIDE provides
domain-based guarantees for communication within a TD,
many of the properties also translate for communication be-
tween TDs. For example, static channels on the up-paths
still guarantee low-capacity throughput. Only BE channels
are getting lower guarantees, as there is no explicit indi-
cation that the receiver desires the communication. Thus,
establishing a connection to a public service that is under
attack will be challenging for an external host. However,
as soon as the service receives one initial packet and desires
to serve that client, it can set up a dynamic channel with
the same protected bandwidth guarantees within each TD
assuming no congestion on high-capacity links between TDs.
Malicious ADs inside TD. ADs within a TD may get
compromised, failing to regulate traﬃc. Although this is
unlikely in well-administered ADs, attackers can neverthe-
less exploit software vulnerabilities in routers or adminis-
trative workstations. STRIDE can identify malicious ADs
using neighborhood monitoring and existing fault detection
protocols [32]. For example, if any AD sends more traﬃc
than their allocated share, the AD must be malicious or mis-
conﬁgured and the neighboring AD can block the oﬀending
traﬃc. As a technical defense, once the malicious AD is de-
tected, hosts can avoid the malicious AD by selecting paths
that avoid traversing that AD. Most importantly, since all
ADs of a TD are within a uniform legal environment, the
TDC can revoke the membership of misbehaving ADs.
Directional paths and asymmetric bandwidth re-

tional or asymmetric with diﬀerent bandwidths in the two
directions. STRIDE can ﬂexibly accommodate asymmetric
paths with minimal modiﬁcations as follows. To request a
packet on a directional path, the source puts in the header
both the forward and backward paths. For example, dy-
namic ﬂow capabilities can be requested on both the forward
and return paths, and sent back to the other party through
suﬃcient space allocated in the packet header. Bandwidth
requests may be asymmetric, as in downloads the client-to-
server bandwidth is one to two orders of magnitude smaller
(acknowledgment packets are smaller than data packets). In
this case, STRIDE supports asymmetric bandwidth alloca-
tions, where a uni-directional path token or ﬂow capability
is requested with diﬀerent amounts of bandwidth depending
on the direction.
9. RELATED WORK
Network-layer DDoS defense mechanisms can be largely
classiﬁed into two categories: router-level bandwidth control
and architectural extensions. One can generally combine
approaches in these two categories for stronger properties.
Router-level bandwidth control. Typical router-level
approaches to DDoS defense aim to ﬁlter or limit identiﬁed
attack ﬂows.
Filtering:
install ﬁlters
against attack sources near their origins (i.e., source ADs) to
prevent collateral damage of attack traﬃc. This would es-

on source ADs’ cooperation that would incur substantial
overhead for managing ﬂow state and packet inspection. In
contrast, STRIDE facilitates natural trust relationships be-
tween ADs within the same trust domain. Network-layer
capability schemes [26, 29] enable routers to perform state-
less ﬁltering without needing any trust on other routers, but
are vulnerable to the DoC attack [6]. Though Portcullis [19]
addresses the DoC attack, it requires high computational
overhead even on benign source hosts.
Bandwidth throttling: Many bandwidth control mecha-
nisms (especially the fair queueing mechanisms) proposed
to date can be used to prevent some (malicious) ﬂows from
exhausting the network bandwidth [14, 15, 18, 21, 25]. How-
ever, per-ﬂow or per-sender fair sharing does not provide any
guarantees by design as the fair bandwidth becomes too low
as more entities (e.g., ﬂows) compete for a limited resource.
Moreover, existing mechanisms require source authentica-
tion, which is diﬃcult to provide eﬃciently.
Bandwidth guarantees: Existing approaches [7, 8] aiming
to provide bandwidth guarantees to ﬂows fail in cases where
all available bandwidth is exhausted. FLoc [12] diﬀerenti-
ates legitimate ﬂows from attack ﬂows to provide diﬀerential
bandwidth guarantees. Low-rate attack ﬂows, however, can
often not be precisely distinguished from legitimate ﬂows,
thereby the lower bound of bandwidth may not be observed.
Architectural support. SCION inherently provides a de-
fault level of protection against DDoS attacks. For example,
SCION’s periodic topology discovery and resulting path-
diversity by default enable agile path adjustment to avoid
attacked areas. However, SCION itself does not provide
any DDoS defense guarantee. Several other next-generation
Internet architectures [17, 20, 27], instead of providing in-
trinsic DDoS resilience, aim to provide routing ﬂexibility,
path diversity [27], expressive routing policies [17, 20], etc.
A line of multi-path routing protocols have also been pro-
posed [9,11,16,24,28] to provide path diversity to the source
nodes. Although the source nodes can utilize the path di-
versity to circumvent victim links/routers under a DDoS
attack, the destinations are still left with little inbound traf-
ﬁc control. Furthermore, these protocols are built on top of
the current Internet, thus still suﬀering from the underlying
weaknesses of today’s Internet. For example, local identiﬁ-
cation of attack sources can be imprecise or impossible to
counter large-scale botnet attacks that do not directly target
a speciﬁc service or endpoint.
10. CONCLUSION
A core goal of the STRIDE architecture is to achieve in-
trinsic DDoS defense with relatively simple routers. In par-
ticular, we avoid per-ﬂow state in the fastpath, asymmet-
ric cryptographic operations, reliance on untrustworthy do-
mains, and key establishment across ADs. Even with our rel-
atively simple operations, we can achieve protection against
DDoS from large botnets. Reﬂecting on the STRIDE ar-
chitecture, we observe that measured trust in ADs located
within the same legal environment providing viable pros-
ecution helps to simplify the architecture and results in
higher eﬃciency, meanwhile the untrustworthy ADs outside
the trust domain cannot inﬂict damage against local within-
trust-domain communication. We anticipate that STRIDE
provides a useful point in the design space to study holistic
network architectures with strong DDoS defense properties.

APPENDIX
A. LINK CAPACITY DIVISION
Using estimations, we show how STRIDE ADs can divide
their link capacity to the three traﬃc classes, and how much
static bandwidth can be allocated to a path.
Division of link capacity to three traﬃc classes. We
provide guidelines that an AD can follow to divide its total
link capacity to three traﬃc classes: static, dynamic, and
BE. First, given that the current real-world link utilization
is mostly below 30% based on the CAIDA dataset [2], al-
locating 30% of the link capacity to the BE class would
satisfy legacy Internet traﬃc in most cases. Subsequently,
assuming the static and dynamic classes are allocated s and
d fractions of the link capacity, respectively, the following
conditions should hold:
s + d = 1 − 30%
40Gbps × s > 500Kbps × 10000
(2)
(3)
The ﬁrst condition ensures a link will not be overloaded
when each bandwidth class is being fully utilized. The sec-
ond condition assumes an OC-768 link capacity (40 Gbps) to
be divided among around 10000 paths, such that each end-
point in a medium-size TD (e.g., a US TD with around 2200
ADs, according to the CAIDA dataset) can choose up to 10
paths in our experiment. The second condition requires the
static bandwidth allocated to each path be no less than 500
Kbps.
Based on these guidelines, a reasonable example allocation
is to divide 5 – 15%, 60 – 65%, and 30% link capacity to
the static, dynamic, and BE traﬃc classes, respectively. In
practice, an AD can adjust the numbers in the conditions
based on its own link capacity, number of current paths that
the AD supports, etc. Furthermore, when any bandwidth
class is not fully utilized, other congested traﬃc class can
take up all the bandwidth that is currently available.
B. BANDWIDTH OVERBOOKING
Section 5.1 introduces bandwidth overbooking for simulta-
neous enhancement of path quality and diversity, but with
possible denial of path activation. To mitigate this issue,
we suggest an appropriate overbooking ratio by analyzing
the relationship between an overbooking ratio and the cor-
responding probability of path activation denial as follows.
In the following, we consider an intermediate AD ADp
wanting to determine its overbooking ratio. Let Ii and Ej
represent the ith ingress interface from the providers (0 ≤
i ≤ l) and the jth egress interface to the customers (0 ≤ j ≤
m), respectively. Let each ingress interface connect to all m
egress interfaces. We assume that m interfaces connect to n
customer ADs (i.e., each customer AD has m
n links to ADp).
Then, each customer AD has at least l·m
n distinct paths
In this setting, suppose each
to the TDC through ADp.
customer AD selects uniformly at random k out of the l·m
n
paths to the TDC, then the probability that the customer
ADs select Ii more than t times in total would be: PIi (t) ≈
1 − Pt
m . This implies that Ii’s
bandwidth needs to be allocated to t egress interfaces (out
of m interfaces), which would increase per-path bandwidth
allocation by t−β
is the average number
of activated paths through Ii.
, suﬃcient path
diversity (as much as t·l
n·k ) is provided to customer ADs.
β , where β = n·k
As a result, ADp may determine t such that the proba-
bility of the denial of path activation does not exceed some
threshold Pth (i.e., PIi (t) ≤ Pth). For example, Pth = 0.2
means that 80% of path activation requests would be ac-
cepted on average; hence, the expected number of trials for
successful path activation becomes 1.25. That is, Pth deter-
mines the number of requests that should be made by an
endpoint AD until successful path activation.
