Question: "In developing an application, a programmer decides to override certain default settings of App Transport Security (ATS) and chooses not to incorporate the recommended IPv6 security measures. What are the potential consequences of these actions?"
 "A": "The app may use weaker ciphers like RSA_AES without forward secrecy if the domain-specific forward secrecy requirement is disabled."
 "B": "The IPv6 addresses of the app's users could be more easily tracked across networks, reducing user privacy."
 "C": "The app's network connections could fail if the server does not support TLS 1.2 or if the server's certificate is not valid or strong enough."
 "D": "The app may experience uninterrupted service as certificate validity and revocation are not checked."
