### Throughput Analysis in WAN Setting

**Figure 5: Throughput for f = 1 in the WAN Setting**

- **Throughput Comparison**: The peak throughput observed for CP2 is approximately 26% lower than that of PBFT. However, CP2 and CP3 consistently outperform CP1, with their peak throughputs being 38% and 32% higher, respectively.

### Varying Faulty Replicas (f)

**Figure 6: Peak Throughput for f = 1, 2, 3**

- **Observation**: As the number of faulty replicas (f) increases, the throughput difference between CP2 and CP3 becomes more pronounced. This is because CP3 requires a larger number of secret shares to recover the secret, leading to increased communication and computational overhead.

### Throughput in WAN Setting

- **Significant Performance**: In the WAN setting, the throughput of CP1, CP2, and CP3 remains significantly higher than that of CP0. An interesting observation is that CP1 outperforms CP3 as the number of clients increases.

### Failure Scenarios in LAN Setting

#### Scenario 1: Partial Witness Transmission

- **Description**: Clients send witnesses (message and opening) to only a fraction of the replicas, and all replicas are correct.
- **Result**: No significant performance difference was observed in terms of latency and throughput compared to the failure-free scenario, confirming our expectations.

#### Scenario 2: Faulty Clients

- **Description**: Clients fail to send witnesses to any correct replica.
- **Cleanup Cycle**: Set to a conservative valueâ€”10 times the average latency.
- **Throughput Impact**: During the cleanup cycle, the throughput drops to zero. The cleanup cycle is shorter for 5 clients compared to 10 clients due to lower average latency. After the cleanup, there is a significant improvement in throughput, and the system performance resumes.

### Latency for CP0, CP2, and CP3 with Faulty Replicas

**Table IV: Latency for CP0, CP2, and CP3 with Faulty Replicas (in ms)**

| Protocol | f = 1 | f = 2 | f = 3 |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| CP0      | 1280.30 | 1513.40 | 1671.60 |
| CP2      | 0.26 | 0.28 | 0.39 |
| CP3      | 0.43 | 0.50 | 0.71 |

- **Performance Degradation**: Both CP2 and CP3 show reasonable performance degradation under Byzantine replica failures. The difference between CP2 and CP3 becomes more evident compared to the failure-free scenario, primarily due to CP3's increased communication and computation requirements.
- **CP0 Performance**: CP0 experiences a significant slowdown as each replica must perform more expensive decryption share verification operations.

### Conclusion

Over the past three decades, secure causal atomic broadcast protocols have relied on expensive threshold cryptosystems. Our work revisits this problem by providing both generic frameworks and efficient instantiations. We demonstrate that such protocols can be constructed from a variety of cryptographic primitives, and our protocols significantly outperform those based on traditional threshold cryptosystems. At the core of our constructions are two new cryptographic primitives that may be of independent interest.
