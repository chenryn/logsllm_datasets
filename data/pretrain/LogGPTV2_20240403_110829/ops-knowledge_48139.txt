User: Design a high-availability network topology, including redundant routers, switches, and servers.
Assistant: The following is a high-availability network topology: 1. Redundant routers: Install at least two routers to ensure that when one router fails, the other can take over the network traffic and continue to work normally. Redundant links can be used between routers, that is, backup links, which will automatically switch when the main link fails. 2. Redundant switches: Again, install at least two switches to ensure that if one switch fails, the other can forward network traffic to the correct destination. Redundant links can be used between switches. 3. Servers: More resources and skills are required to provide high availability server solutions. You can use multiple servers to run the same application, balance traffic and requests through a load balancer, so that each server can work normally, and ensure that when one server fails, other servers can continue to provide services to users. In short, high-availability network topology needs to consider redundancy and automatic switching mechanisms, so as to maintain the continuity of network services.
