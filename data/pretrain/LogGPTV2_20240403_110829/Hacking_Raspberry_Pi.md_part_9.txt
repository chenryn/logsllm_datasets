### Pi and Its Command-Line Interface

The term "Pi" is an indirect reference to the Python programming language. Here's a detailed overview of some key components and features:

- **LXTerminal**: This is the command-line interface for the Raspberry Pi. It allows you to perform all the tasks you can do in a terminal environment, even when outside of the graphical user interface (GUI).

- **OCR Resources**: This shortcut opens the Midori web browser and navigates to the ICT and Computing page of the Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR) website. This site is a valuable resource for teachers looking to integrate Raspberry Pi into their academic curricula.

- **IDLE**: This is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python 2, providing a user-friendly interface for writing and testing Python code.

- **Python Games**: This simple app launcher allows you to try out a variety of Python-based games.

### Annotations at the Bottom of Figure 6.1

To help differentiate between the many small icons, they have been numbered for clarity:

1. **Main Menu**: An app launcher that functions similarly to the Windows 7 Start menu, providing access to various applications and settings.

2. **PCManFM**: A lightweight file manager that operates like Windows Explorer or the OS X Finder. You can view PCManFM in Figure 6.3.

   **Figure 6.3**: The PCManFM file manager.

3. **Midori**: A lightweight web browser suitable for basic browsing needs.

4. **Minimize All**: Clicking this button minimizes all open windows to the LXPanel, allowing for a cleaner desktop.

5. **Virtual Desktops**: Linux has long supported virtual desktops, which extend your desktop environment beyond the physical monitor. By default, you get two desktops, but you can customize this by right-clicking one of the virtual desktop icons, selecting "Desktop Pager Settings," and adjusting the options in the Openbox Configuration Manager.

   **Note: Understanding Virtual Desktops**
   - A virtual desktop in Linux, including on the Raspberry Pi, is a software-based method for creating multiple desktop environments. Each desktop can display different application or document windows, providing a more organized workspace. This feature is a cost-effective alternative to using multiple physical monitors.

6. **LXPanel (the bottom bar as a whole)**: Functions like the Task Bar in Windows 7. Each element on the bar is an applet that can be customized. To modify the LXPanel, right-click an empty area and select "Panel Settings."

7. **CPU Usage Monitor**: Provides real-time data on the CPU's activity level.

8. **Digital Clock**: Right-click the clock and select "Digital Clock Settings" to edit its format. The clock uses a unique, propeller-head style; visit [http://is.gd/XHcNwN](http://is.gd/XHcNwN) for more details on the syntax.

9. **Screenlock**: Click this button to lock your Pi, preventing unauthorized access when you are not using the system.

10. **Logout**: Use this control to leave the GUI, return to a terminal prompt, reboot the system, or shut down the Pi.

**Application Launch Bar (Buttons B–D)**: These shortcuts are the default ones. To add more, right-click one of the app shortcuts and select "Application Launch Bar Settings" from the menu.

### Delving into the Main Menu

The Start menu has been a staple of Microsoft operating systems since Windows 95. While it was removed in Windows 8, the LXDE Main Menu offers a similar experience. Here’s a breakdown of the top-level navigation:

- **Accessories**: Contains links to tools such as an image viewer, Leafpad text editor, LXTerminal, and Xarchiver for zip/unzip operations.

- **Education**: Launches Scratch or Squeak, which is based on the Smalltalk programming language.

- **Graphics**: Allows you to view PDF files using the open-source xpdf viewer.

- **Internet**: Opens the Midori and Dillo web browsers and provides Wi-Fi configuration options.

- **Office**: Includes the Orage Calendar and Orage Globaltime utilities, which are part of the XFCE desktop environment.

- **Other**: A catch-all category for miscellaneous tools that don’t fit into other groups.

- **Programming**: Launches Scratch or the Python 2/3 IDLE development environments.

- **Sound & Video**: Configures the Pi’s onboard audio, which is directly handled by the Broadcom SoC.

- **System Tools**: Manages tasks like renaming files, viewing running processes, and using the Thunar File Manager.

- **Preferences**: Contains several file and system management utilities.

- **Run**: Similar to the Run box in Windows 7, it allows you to issue terminal commands from the GUI.

- **Logout**: Exits the GUI and returns to the command prompt.

The organization of the Main Menu may seem haphazard, and there is no graphical method for customization. However, you can manage the `*.desktop` files in the `/usr/share/applications` directory to customize the menu. For more details, see [http://is.gd/OTcpFy](http://is.gd/OTcpFy).

### Installing, Updating, and Removing Software

In Chapter 5, you learned about using `apt-get` commands to update repositories and installed software. Let’s revisit the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT):

- **Repository**: An online source of regularly updated installation packages specific to each Linux distribution.

- **View Raspbian Repositories**: Open LXTerminal and type `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list` to view the list. On my system, it contained:
  ```bash
  deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ wheezy main contrib non-free rpi
  ```
  Exit without saving changes by typing `CTRL+X, N`.

- **Update Repository**: Run `sudo apt-get update`.

- **Install Software**: If you know the package name, use `sudo apt-get install <package_name>`. For example:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install xfce4
  ```

- **Search for Packages**: If you don’t remember the exact name, use `sudo apt-cache search <keyword>`.

- **List Installed Packages**: Use `dpkg` to generate a list of installed packages:
  ```bash
  sudo dpkg --get-selections > ~/Desktop/packages
  ```
  View the list with `nano ~/Desktop/packages`.

- **Uninstall Software**: Use `sudo apt-get remove <package_name>`. For a complete uninstall, including configuration files, use:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get --purge remove <package_name>
  ```

- **Periodic Updates**: Run `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade` to keep your system up to date.

### Accessing the Pi Store

The Pi Store, similar to the Microsoft Store or Apple Store, is a platform for finding and downloading software specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi. To use the Pi Store:

1. **Create a Free Account**: Click "Login" in the upper-right corner and then "Register."

2. **Download a Free App**: Navigate to the Games section, find a free app like CrazyWorms2, and click "Free Download." The app will appear in your library, and you can launch it from there.

### Tweaking the LXDE UI

To personalize the LXDE graphical environment:

- **Change Desktop Background**: Right-click the desktop, select "Desktop Preferences," and adjust the wallpaper and background color.

- **Customize LXTerminal**: Open LXTerminal, go to "Edit, Preferences," and adjust the font, colors, cursor style, and scrollback value.

- **Customize LXPanel**: Right-click an applet and select the first option to customize it. Use "Panel Settings" to adjust the panel's geometry, appearance, and applets.

### Openbox

Openbox is the window manager that runs behind LXPanel. Access the Openbox Configuration Manager from the Main Menu under "Preferences" to make further tweaks to applets and global settings.

### Editing Configuration Files

Despite the GUI, many tweaks and configurations are done by editing text files. For example, to disable the screensaver, edit the autostart file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
```
Remove the line `@xscreensaver -no-splash`, save, and exit. Always use `sudo` to edit configuration files to avoid permission issues.

### Networking Raspberry Pi

#### Basic Networking Concepts

- **Ethernet**: The standard networking protocol used by most LANs and the Internet.
- **IP Address**: A unique identifier for each host on a network. IPv4 addresses are in the form `192.168.1.204`.
- **Subnet Mask**: Differentiates the network portion from the host portion, e.g., `255.255.255.0`.
- **DHCP**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to hosts on a network.

#### Configuring Wired Ethernet
