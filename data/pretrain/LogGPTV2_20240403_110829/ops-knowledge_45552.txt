User: I need to know a value holding timestamp when my app was deployed on the GAE server. In runtime.
Surely I could generate some Python constant in the deployment script. But is there an easier and more correct way to reach the goal?
(I'd like not to use data store for that.)
Assistant: Wrap appcfg.py in a shell script. Before actually running appcfg.py update, save the current time, possibly adjusting for your time zone, if necessary, in a file that's marked as a resource. You can open and read that file from the deployed app.
Alternatively, have that script substitute the current time directly into code, obviating the need for a file open.
