ABSTRACT
The evolution of the Information and Communication Tech-
nology (ICT) has radically changed our lives, making infor-
mation available from anywhere at any time through dif-
ferent kinds of devices. The advantage of the growing avail-
ability of computational power and connectivity resources at
low prices is the easiness of collecting, sharing, processing,
and accessing information. This advantage however does
not come for free as it introduces unprecedented privacy
risks. The attention toward these problems is growing every
day and the need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and
techniques has been widely recognized. WPES is a yearly
forum, this year at its 12th edition, that brings together re-
searchers and practitioners interested in discussing the pri-
vacy issues characterizing our global and interconnected so-
ciety.

INTRODUCTION
The recent advancements of digital infrastructures have
revolutionized the way in which data are collected, stored,
managed, processed, shared, and distributed. Nowadays,
thanks to a wide network connectivity, we can rely on exter-
nal servers for storing our pictures and videos, use the com-
putational power oﬀered at low prices by cloud providers,
access remotely stored data made available by third parties.
These are only a few examples of the advantages of living

in a globally interconnected society, where everything we
are looking for is at the distance of ‘a mouse click’. The
price we pay for these beneﬁts is a higher privacy risk, due
to the increased amount of sensitive information collected,
stored, and distributed, and to the lack of control of the
users on their own data. It is interesting to note that the
problem of protecting privacy is continuously changing as
technology evolves, presenting new opportunities for users
but also introducing (as downside) new vulnerabilities. Pri-
vacy problems are receiving more and more the attention of
researchers and regulators, as well as of private users and
public organizations.
WPES aims to bring together researchers and practition-
ers who are interested in discussing on privacy issues arising
in the electronic society. Privacy problems concern many dif-
ferent areas (e.g., data management, social networks, cloud
systems, wireless networks, mobile devices). This yearly fo-
rum represents an occasion for participants to present and
share their theoretical as well as experimental results, to
learn about new solutions for known privacy problems, and
also to discuss open issues that still need to be addressed.
The workshop is this year at its 12th edition. Like for past
editions, WPES is held in conjunction with the ACM CCS
conference – the ﬂagship annual conference of the Special
Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC) of
the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). This co-
location has advantages for both the events as the workshop
enriches the conference program and, at the same time, ben-
eﬁts from the presence of a wide community of researchers,
practitioners, developers, and users interested in information
security topics.
The workshop solicited submissions from academia and in-
dustry presenting novel research on all theoretical and prac-
tical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental
studies. It also encouraged submissions from other commu-
nities such as law and business that present these communi-
ties’ perspectives on technological issues. Topics of interest
for paper submission included, but were not limited to:
• anonymity, pseudonymity, and unlinkability
• crowdsourcing for privacy and security
• data correlation and leakage attacks
• data security and privacy
• electronic communication privacy
• economics of privacy
• information dissemination control

2. WORKSHOP CONTRIBUTIONS
This year, the workshop received a record number of sub-
missions, 103, from 27 diﬀerent countries. Among these pa-
pers, the program committee accepted 20 full papers and
10 short papers. The topics of the papers in the workshop
program cover a wide variety of scenarios, such as privacy in
social networks, privacy of genomic data, privacy in mobile
scenarios, privacy of location data.
