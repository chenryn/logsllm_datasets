# Brief Summary
The main idea is to allow settings some flag that will specify the number of
tasks the worker should execute before exiting.  
The reason to do so is to able to scale celery workers over Kubernetes in a
reasonable matter.  
You would create a pod with a worker set to consume 1 message and then
exiting, in Kubernetes you will create a job for each message in the broker
queue that will start that said pod.  
The current way to do something like that is kinda ugly since the auto scaler
of Kubernetes might decide to scale down a worker that is currently running
and in long-running tasks that can be problematic
