User: I want to prevent the user from going back to the shell prompt by pressing CTRL + Z from my python command line interpreter script. How can I do that?
Assistant: Roughly speaking the Ctrl+Z from a Unix/Linux terminal in cooked or canonical modes will cause the terminal driver to generate a "suspend" signal to the foreground application.
So you have two different overall approaches.  Change the terminal settings or ignore the signal.
If you put the terminal into "raw" mode then you disable that signal generation.  It's also possible to use terminal settings (import tty and read the info about tcsetattr, but also read the man pages for ``stty` and terminfo(5) for more details).
ZelluX has already described the simplest signal handling approach.
