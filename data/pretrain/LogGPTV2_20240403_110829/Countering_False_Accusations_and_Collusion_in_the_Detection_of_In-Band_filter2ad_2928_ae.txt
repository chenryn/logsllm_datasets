7.  Discussion 
in 
instantaneously 
suppressing  FAs 
The  72%  overall  effectiveness  of  opportunistic 
voting 
is 
encouraging, but by itself, is probably not sufficient to 
allow  use  in  an  operational  setting.    Significantly 
greater  accuracy,  however,  appears  possible  by 
combining  voting  tallies  with  other  historical  (non-
instantaneous)  evidence.    First,  since  many  of  the 
successful  FA  periods  were  relatively  short,  an 
operational detector could be configured to ignore FA 
periods that persist for less than a minimum duration, 
for  example,  30  seconds.    While  this  would  increase 
detection  latency  from  the  onset  of  a  true  wormhole 
attack, it could be justified if wormhole attacks of such 
short duration were deemed 1) to pose a minor threat 
and  2)  too  difficult  to  distinguish  from  the  general 
MANET  “noise”.    Second,  since  a  normal  link  is 
unlikely  to  transform  itself  into  a  wormhole  (or  vice 
versa), a link’s prior or subsequent history can also be 
considered.  If 95% of a link’s lifetime has been free of 
successful  accusations,  then  the  5%  during  which  the 
link  has  been  accused  should  be  evaluated  with 
skepticism.  Third, it may be possible to utilize voting 
history.    Nodes  whose  accusatory  votes  have  often 
been  at  odds  with  the  majority  could  be  given  less 
weight in voting tallies.  This would force attackers to 
be  much  more  selective  in  use  of  false  accusations 
because failure to prevail in initial voting tallies would 
reduce chances of prevailing in the future.   
A  surprising  result  is  that  the  effectiveness  of 
opportunistic  voting  in  suppressing  FAs  does  not 
appear  to  be  more  strongly  correlated  with  average 
node degree.  This is counter-intuitive because having 
a 
the 
neighborhood surrounding a falsely accused link would 
seem  to  increase  the  likelihood  that  two  colluding 
attackers would be outvoted. 
larger  population  of  honest  nodes 
in 
Whether  there  are  enough  independent  pairs  of 
observers to vote for the accused link depends not only 
on the density of the network, but on two other factors.  
First, the topology of the network must be such that the 
accused  nodes  have  a  sufficient  number  of  disjoint 
honest neighbors.  For example, if node A in Figure 3 
were  to  move  to  the  right  and  become  a  neighbor  of 
both B and C, it would no longer be able to send 3-hop 
probes to D via link BC.  D would become two hops 
from A and would cease being a destination for A’s 3-
hop  probes.    Moreover,  even  if  A  sent  probes  to  D, 
they  would  pass  only  through  C,  skipping  B.    So 
despite  A’s  proximity,  it  would  no  longer  be  able  to 
probe or vote for link BC.   
Second,  between  a  pair  of  nodes  that  are  3  hops 
apart, there may be several alternate paths available as 
routes,  and  OLSR  will  arbitrarily  choose  any  one  of 
these.    If  OLSR  chooses  the  path  through  the  falsely 
accused link, the pair of nodes can probe the path and 
then  vote  in  favor  of  the  accused  link.    However,  if 
OLSR chooses a different path, the pair will be able to 
vote on some other link’s innocence, but not the falsely 
accused  link.    Although  increasing  the  density  in  the 
vicinity  of  a  victim  link  may  increase  the  potential 
number  of  paths  through  which  observers  may  probe 
an  accused  link,  the  actual  number  is  determined  by 
OLSR. 
Since  the  effectiveness  of  an  in-band  wormhole 
attack  and  false  accusations  depends  on  attacker 
spacing,  it  is  challenging  to  construct  good  test  cases 
that  utilize  random  mobility  models.    As  mentioned 
above,  the  amount  of  interesting  FA  data  generated 
during test runs was strongly correlated with network 
density.    This  probably  resulted  from  using  identical 
geographic  spacing  for  the  attackers  in  all  runs.    The 
spacing  was  chosen  so  that  the  pair  of  attackers  on 
each side of the topology would be 3 hops apart during 
most of the 48-node test runs.  We decided to keep this 
spacing the same in all runs to minimize the number of 
experimental variables that might affect run outcomes.  
However,  the  number  of  hops  between  two  nodes 
depends  not  only  on  geographic  spacing  but  on  the 
proximity  of  intermediary  nodes.    At  lower  network 
densities,  there  is  less  chance  that  two  intermediary 
nodes  will  be  close  to  the  “line-of-sight”  between  a 
pair of attackers.  If the two closest intermediaries are 
too  far  from  this  line  then  they  will  not  be  able  to 
bridge a path between two attackers without additional 
intermediaries,  which  would  increase  the  hop  count 
between the attackers.  Consequently, at lower network 
densities,  the  length  of  a  path  between  a  pair  of 
attackers is more likely to be greater than 3 hops.  The 
result is that a pair of attackers will less often be able 
to  generate  corroborating  false  accusations. 
  In 
hindsight, it might have been better to adjust (reduce) 
the attacker spacing for lower densities to compensate.  
Alternatively,  run  durations  could  be  extended  for 
lower density test runs. 
A  simplifying  assumption  listed  in  Section  4.1  is 
that  measurements  can  be  reliably  communicated  to 
one  or  more  correlation  nodes.    In  making  this 
assumption, we sidestep one of the fundamental issues 
underlying 
in 
distributed  systems,  namely 
that  communications 
between nodes often depends on correct forwarding by 
intermediary nodes, which may be malicious [15].  We 
focus instead on a prerequisite question:  
the  Byzantine  agreement  problem 
Is  the  totality  of  data  distributed  throughout  the 
network adequate to enable a correct consensus?  
If the data is not adequate, then no communications 
protocol  can  make  it  so,  and  the  forwarding  issue  is

moot.    This  paper  provides  partial  evidence  that  the 
data  produced  by  our  prototype 
(3-hop  path 
measurements)  is  adequate  for  correct  wormhole 
detection decisions, even in the presence of colluding 
attackers  and  false  accusations.    However,  reducing 
these  techniques  to  practice  will  ultimately  require 
being  able  to  reach  consensus  when  communications 
depends  on  forwarding  by  potentially  malicious 
intermediary nodes.  
8.  Conclusion 
Detecting  attacks  on  MANET 
routing  and 
forwarding  requires  cooperative  detection  techniques 
that  utilize  ordinary,  relatively  vulnerable  hosts  as 
intrusion  sensors.    If  compromised,  these  hosts  can 
inject bogus data into the intrusion detection system to 
conceal  malicious  activities  or  falsely  accuse  well-
behaved nodes.  The ease with which such data can be 
injected poses a fundamental threat to any cooperative 
intrusion  detection  system.    Approaches  to  Byzantine 
fault  tolerance  that  involve  voting  are  potentially 
applicable, but must address the fact that only nodes in 
particular  topological  locations  at  a  particular  time  1) 
can observe the symptoms of a particular attack and 2) 
are  therefore  eligible  to  vote  on  whether  an  attack 
occurred.   
We  have  examined  this  issue  in  the  context  of  a 
prototype  distributed  detector  for  self-contained,  in-
band  wormholes  in  an  OLSR  network,  focusing  in 
particular on false accusations.  The detector analyzes 
roundtrip  delay  measurements  of  3-hop  paths  and 
correlates  these  to  identify  the  locations  of  wormhole 
links  and  thus  the  attackers.    The  detector  was  tested 
using  specialized  wormhole  attack  software 
that 
reports  bogus  delay  measurements  to  conceal  its 
presence and falsely accuse nearby nodes.  In addition, 
this software manipulates delay measurements reported 
by  other  nodes  so  that  they  are  tricked  into  falsely 
accusing their neighbors.

treating  false  accusations  as  yet  another  intrusion

may  be  complex  because  attackers  can  trick  other 
nodes into generating false accusations and may do so 
probabilistically to remain stealthy.  We have recently
