User: I am trying to open a subprocess but have it be detached from the parent script that called it. Right now if I call subprocess.popen and the parent script crashes the subprocess dies as well.
I know there are a couple of options for windows but I have not found anything for *nix.
I also don't need to call this using subprocess. All I need is to be able to cal another process detached and get the pid.
Assistant: fork the subprocs using the NOHUP option
