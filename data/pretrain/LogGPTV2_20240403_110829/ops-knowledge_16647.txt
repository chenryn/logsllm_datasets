### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:08:09 to 18:08:14 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues and events within a Hadoop environment. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Address Change Detection**:
   - The system detects an address change for two components:
     - `RMCommunicator Allocator` (port 8030)
     - `LeaseRenewer` (port 9000)
   - The old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170` changes to `msra-sa-41`.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times.
   - The failure durations are 192, 193, 194, 195, and 196 seconds, respectively.
   - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly.

3. **Connection Retry Attempts**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The retry policy is `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.
   - The system logs an error when it fails to contact the Resource Manager (RM).

### Conclusion
The log indicates ongoing issues with address changes, failed lease renewals, and unsuccessful attempts to connect to the RM. The system is configured to retry these operations, but the errors persist, suggesting a need for further investigation into the underlying causes.
