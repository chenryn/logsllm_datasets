### Summary of Findings

**Table 1.** The estimated net profit for administrators (admins) from 348 pump and dump events during our sample period is 199.52 BTC, equivalent to approximately $1.1 million USD. The average return for insiders is 18%, which aligns with the findings of Li et al. [23].

**Investor Payout:** In a zero-sum game, the aggregate investor loss would be equivalent to the aggregate admin gain. Some investors win, while others lose.

### Coin Announcement Views

Our analysis of coin announcement messages distributed via Telegram channels revealed a negative correlation (-0.162) between the number of views and the pump gain. This is counterintuitive, as one might expect more views to indicate higher participation and, consequently, higher pump gains. For example, the MST pump announcement had 325 views and a 12.6% gain, whereas the PARTY pump announcement had only 18 views but a 533.3% gain.

This finding suggests that the number of views does not accurately reflect the number of participants, possibly due to:
1. Only a fraction of viewers actually participating in the pump and dump.
2. Views counted even if the user reads the message history after the pump.
3. Repeated views within 24 hours being counted multiple times.
4. Participants retrieving messages via bots, which are not counted in the view count.

### Price Increase

We observed that although Binance generates more trading volume during the pump hour, the price increase through pumps is generally smaller compared to Cryptopia and Yobit. This is likely due to high bid and sell walls on the order book, which prevent significant price fluctuations even during coordinated pump and dump events.

### Arbitrage Opportunities

Pump and dump activities create arbitrage opportunities across different exchanges. Figure 11 illustrates the price discrepancies of the same coin during the pump hour across various exchanges. Interestingly, the coin price can sometimes be higher in exchanges other than the pumped one. Most coins pumped in Cryptopia are also listed in Yobit but not in Bittrex or Binance, and vice versa, due to their different coin listing strategies.

### Capturing Features

**Market Cap:** The market cap distribution of pumped coins ranges from 1 BTC (Royal Kingdom Coin, RKC) to 27,600 BTC (TrueUSD, TUSD). Half of the pumped coins have a market cap below 100 BTC, with most being pumped in Cryptopia. This preference for small-cap coins is consistent with equity market manipulators' behavior.

**Price Movement:** Figure 13 shows the time series of hourly log returns for pumped coins. We detected anomalous return signals before the pump-and-dump announcements, with the strongest signals appearing one hour prior to the pump. This is consistent with the findings of Kamps et al. [20], who suggest a shorter, 12-hour rolling estimation window for anomaly detection in the crypto-market.

### Predicting Pump-and-Dump Target Coins

**Feature Selection:**
- **Market Cap:** Market cap information extracted from CoinMarketCap.
- **Returns Before Pump:** x-hour log return of the coin within the time window from x + 1 hours to 1 hour before the pump.
- **Volumes in Coin and BTC Before Pump:** Total amount of the coin traded and total trading volume measured in BTC within the specified time window.
- **Return Volatilities Before Pump:** Volatility in the hourly log return of the coin.
- **Volume Volatilities in Coin and BTC Before Pump:** Volatility in the hourly trading volume in coin and BTC.
- **Last Price Before Pump:** Open price of the coin one hour before the announcement.
- **Time Since Existence:** Time difference between the first block mined and the pump time.
- **Pumped Times Before:** Number of times the coin has been pumped in Cryptopia.
- **Coin Rating, Withdrawal Fee, Minimum/Maximum Withdrawal, and Minimum Base Trade:** Additional features from Cryptopia.

**Model Application:**
- **Sample Specification:** We considered all coins listed on Cryptopia at each pump-and-dump event. The full sample contains 53,208 pump-coin observations, with 180 pumped cases (0.3%).
- **Model Selection:** We tested both classification (Random Forest, RF) and logit regression (Generalized Linear Model, GLM) models. RF is advantageous for handling large quantities of variables and overcoming overfitting, while GLM is highly interpretable and efficient.
- **Hyperparameter Specification:** We stratified the dataset for RF to include TRUE cases in each tree. We also applied LASSO regularization to GLM to handle the skewed distributions.
- **Variable Assessment:** The most important features for predicting pumped coins using RF models were the coin market cap and the last hour return before the pump. Short-term market movement features were more important than long-term ones.

### Conclusion

Our analysis provides insights into the dynamics of pump and dump schemes in cryptocurrency markets and offers a framework for predicting target coins using machine learning models. The findings highlight the importance of short-term market movements and specific coin features in identifying potential pump and dump targets.
