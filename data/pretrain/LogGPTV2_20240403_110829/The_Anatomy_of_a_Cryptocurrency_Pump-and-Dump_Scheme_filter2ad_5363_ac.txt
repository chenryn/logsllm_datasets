sented in Table 1. We estimate that admins made a net proﬁt
of 199.52 BTC, equivalent to 1.1 million USD, through 348
pump and dump events during our sample period. The esti-
mated return of insiders averages 18%, which aligns perfectly
with Li et al. [23].
So, what is the investors’ payout? Some investors win;
others lose. Since trading is a zero-sum game, the aggregate
investor loss would be on the equivalent scale as the aggregate
admin win.
Coin announcement views: While investigating the degree
of exposure in coin announcement messages distributed by
Telegram channels, we ﬁnd a negative correlation (-0.162) be-
tween number of views of coin announcement and pump gain,
which is rather counter-intuitive, because one would think that
more views would indicate more participation, which would
result in higher pump gain. Two extreme examples: the coin
announcement of the pump on MST had 325 views and the
pump gain was 12.6%; another coin announcement of the
pump on PARTY had only 18 views, and the pump gain was a
whopping 533.3%.
This ﬁnding suggests that the number of views cannot ac-
curately proxy number of participants, possibly because: (1)
only a fraction of message viewers would actually participate
in a pump-and-dump; (2) if a user reads the message history
after the pump, his/her view would still be counted; (3) if a
user re-views a message 24 hours after his/her ﬁrst view, the
user’s view would be counted twice;18 (4) some participants

Price increase: We further notice that although pump-and-
dumps in Binance generate more trading volume during the
pump hour (Figure 8),20 thanks to its large user base, coin
price increase through pumps is generally at a much smaller
scale than that in Cryptopia and Yobit (Figure 9 and Fig-
ure 10). This is possibly caused by high bid and sell walls
on the order book that are typical for large crypto exchanges
like Binance, which prevent the price from ﬂuctuating signiﬁ-
cantly even at coordinated pump-and-dump events.
Arbitrage: Pump-and-dump activities not only engender ab-
normal returns within the pumped exchange, but also arbitrage
opportunities across different exchanges. Figure 11 shows
the presence of a price discrepancy of the same coin during
the pump hour across different exchanges. Interestingly, coin
price can sometimes be higher in exchanges other than the
pumped one. It is also worth noting that most coins pumped
in Cryptopia are also listed in Yobit but not in Bittrex or Bi-
nance, and vice versa. This is because the former two have
more conservative coin listing strategies, which results in a
different, more mainstream portfolio of listed coins compared
to the latter two. While there may be trading strategies result-
ing from these arbitrage opportunities, they are outside the
scope of this work.
4.4 Capturing Features
Market cap: Figure 12 presents the market cap distribution of
coins pumped in different exchanges. Pumped coins’ market
cap ranges from 1 BTC (Royal Kingdom Coin (RKC), pumped
in Cryptopia) to 27,600 BTC (TrueUSD (TUSD), pumped in
Yobit). Half of those coins have a market cap below 100 BTC,
most of which were pumped in Cryptopia.

20A pump hour refers to the clock hour during which a pump occurs.
Figure 12: Distribution of coin market caps. Market cap information was
extracted from CoinMarketCap on November 5, 2018.
Pump-and-dump organizers’ preference for small-cap coins
resembles equity market manipulators’ taste for microcap
stocks [3, 24], and can be explained by the empirical ﬁnding
of Hamrick et al. [18] and Li et al. [23]: the smaller the market
cap of the pumped coin, the more successful the pump would
be.
Price movement: Figure 13 depicts time series of hourly
log returns of pumped coins between 48 hours before and 3
hours after a pump. We detect anomalous return signals before
pump-and-dump admins’ announcement of the pumped coin.
The signals appear most jammed one hour prior to the pump,
and less so before that. This is to a certain degree in accord
with Kamps et al. [20] who ﬁnd that a shorter, 12-hour rolling
estimation window is more suitable for anomaly detection in
the crypto-market than a longer, 24-hour one.
The return signal before the pump is the strongest with
Cryptopia, where in numerous pumps, coin prices were ele-
vated to such an extent that the hourly return before the pump
even exceeds the hourly return during the pump. This can
be explained by the assumption that pump organizers might
utilize their insider information to purchase the to-be-pumped
coin before the coin announcement, causing the coin price
elevation and usual return volatility before the pump. The
analysis above provides grounds for predicting the pumped
coin before coin announcement using coin features and mar-
ket movement.
5 Predicting Pump-and-Dump Target Coins
5.1 Feature Selection
Based on the preliminary analysis in the last section, we be-
lieve pump-and-dump organizers have speciﬁc criteria for
coin selection and they generally purchase the to-be-pumped
coin before naming it to the investors. Thus, it should be pos-
sible to use coin features and market movements prior to a

nization. We choose Cryptopia due to sufﬁcient data collected
for modelling. Although the exchange ceased to operate on
May 15, 2019, our exercise demonstrates a proof of concept
for strategic crypto-trading that can be adapted for any ex-
change.
For each coin before a pump event, we predict whether it
will be pumped (TRUE) or not (FALSE). The formula for the
prediction model is:
Pumped = M(feature1,feature2, . . . )
where the dependent variable Pumped is a binary variable
that equals 1 (TRUE) when the coin is selected for the pump,
and 0 (FALSE) otherwise. Table 2 lists the features considered
in the prediction model.
Previous analyses indicate unusual market movements prior
to the pump-and-dump might signal organizers’ pre-pump
behavior, which could consequently give away the coin se-
lection information. Therefore, we place great emphasis on
features associated with market movements, such as price, re-
turns and volatilities covering various lengths of time. Those
features, 46 in total, account for 85% of all the features con-
sidered.

Sample speciﬁcation: We consider all the coins listed on
Cryptopia at each pump-and-dump event. On average, we
have 296 coin candidates at each pump, out of which one is the
actual pumped coin. The number of coins considered varies
for each event due to constant listing/delisting activities on
the part of exchanges. The full sample contains 53,208 pump-
coin observations, among which 180 are pumped cases,21
accounting for 0.3% of the entire sample population. Appar-
ently, the sample is heavily skewed towards the unpumped
class and needs to be handled with care at modelling.
For robustness tests, we split the whole sample into three
chronologically consecutive datasets: training sample, valida-
tion sample and and test sample:

The training sample covers the period of June 19, 2018 to
September 5, 2018 and consists of 17,138 data points (32.2%
of full sample); the validation sample covers September 5,
2018 to October 29, 2018 and consists of 18,055 data points
(33.9% of full sample); the test sample covers October 29,
2018 to January 11, 2019 and consists of 18,195 data points
(34.2% of full sample).
Model selection: We test both classiﬁcation and logit regres-
sion models for the prediction exercise. Speciﬁcally, for the
classiﬁcation model, we choose random forest (RF) with strat-
iﬁed sampling; for the logit regression model, we apply gen-
eralized linear model (GLM). Both RF and GLM are widely
adopted in machine learning and each has its own quirks.
RF is advantageous in handling large quantities of variables
and overcoming overﬁtting issues. In addition, RF is resilient
to correlations, interactions or non-linearity of the features,
and one can be agnostic about the features. On the ﬂip side,
RF relies upon a voting mechanism based on a large number
of bootstrapped decision trees, which can be time-consuming,
and thus challenging to execute. In addition, RF provides
information on feature importance, which is less intuitive to
interpret than coefﬁcients in GLM.
GLM is a highly interpretable model [28] that can uncover
the correlation between features and the dependent variable.
It is also highly efﬁcient in terms of processing time, which
is a prominent advantage when coping with large datasets.
However, the model is prone to overﬁtting when fed with too
many features, which potentially results in poor out-of-sample
performance.
21Due to missing data on several delisted coins, this number deviates from
the total number of 211 pump events in Cryptopia, as presented in Figure 7.
Hyperparameter speciﬁcation: Due to the heavily imbal-
anced nature of our sample, we stratify the dataset when using
RF [9], such that the model always includes TRUE cases when
bootstrapping the sample to build a decision tree. Speciﬁcally,
we try the following three RF variations:
Model
RF1
RF2
RF3
Sample size per tree

60

20,000

Total
20,060
5,060
1,060
Number
of trees
5,000
10,000
20,000
We ﬁx the number TRUEs at 60 for each RF variation, so that
the model may use the majority of TRUEs to learn their pattern
when building each tree. Model RF1 stays loyal to our sam-
ple’s original TRUE/FALSE ratio, with 0.3% of TRUEs contained
in each tree-sample. RF2 and RF3 raise the TRUE/FALSE ratio
to 1.2% and 6%, respectively. Note that while the sample size
per tree decreases from RF1 to RF2 to RF3, we are mindful
to increase the number of trees accordingly to ensure that
whichever model we use, every input case is predicted a sufﬁ-
cient number of times. We use the R package randomForest
to model our data with RF1, RF2 and RF3.
With conventional binomial GLM, problems can arise not
only when the dependent variable has a skewed distribution,
but also when features are skewed. With heavy-tailed coin
price distribution and market cap distribution, conventional bi-
nomial GLM can be insufﬁcient to handle our sample. There-
fore, we apply LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selec-
tion operator) regularization to the GLM models. After pre-
liminary testing, we choose to focus on three representative
LASSO-GLM models with various shrinkage parameter val-
ues (λ):
Model
GLM1
GLM2
GLM3
Shrinkage parameter (λ)
10−8
10−3
5× 10−3
Higher values of λ causes elimination of more variables.
We use the R package glmnet to model our data with GLM1,
GLM2, and GLM3.
Variable assessment: By applying the speciﬁed models on
the training sample, we are able to assess the features’ rel-
evance to coin prediction. Figure 17 presents features’ im-
portance based on mean decrease in Gini coefﬁcient with RF
models. We ﬁnd that:
• Coin market cap caps and last hour return before the
pump return1h appear to be the two most important fea-
tures in predicting pumped coin using RF models.
• Features describing market movements shortly before
the pump, e.g. return1h, volumeto1h and volumefrom1h,
appear to be more important than features describing
longer-term movements.
