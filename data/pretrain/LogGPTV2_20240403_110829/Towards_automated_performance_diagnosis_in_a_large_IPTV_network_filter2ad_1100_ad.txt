4.3 Validation by Operational Experiences
We describe our experiences in applying Giza on the data col-
lected from the IPTV network (both the provider network and the
customer home network) over one month period in 2008. We demon-
strate how can we apply the suite of techniques in Giza to help
operations in IPTV network.
In this experiment, we consider the performance issues reported
in the customer trouble tickets (Section 4.3.1) and video quality
alarms (Section 4.3.2) as our input symptom event-series. These
are the most direct measures reﬂecting the IPTV performance im-
pairments. We apply Giza in diagnosing these symptoms. We ﬁnd
Giza particularly useful in prioritizing these performance issues as
it offers a big-picture view on the scale and frequency of the prob-
lem. This is an important factor in large-scale network services
such as IPTV – conducting detailed diagnosis and troubleshooting
of every performance problem would exhaust service and opera-
tion resource and become infeasible. Looking at the result, Giza
identiﬁes some expected correlation such as home network faults
and user interface problems correlating strongly with some trou-
ble tickets. Quite interestingly, a small number of provider net-
work events have also been identiﬁed correlating with certain type
of trouble tickets. To further understand this, we drill in our in-
vestigation and apply Giza to identify causal dependencies among
provider network events. Our discovery is presented in Section 4.4.
4.3.1 Customer Trouble Tickets
We focus on customer trouble tickets logged by the IPTV net-
work operators. Each ticket indicates performance related issue
reported by a customer and the time it is reported. Each problem
reported is categorized into one of the ten types of performance
issues: live TV video, audio, digital video recording (DVR), equip-
ment, high deﬁnition, video-on-demand (VoD), parental control,
program guide, remote control and games. We create a symptom
event-series of interest for each of the above types and correlate
the deﬁned symptom event-series with other event-series in home
networks such as STB crash, STB reset and RG reboots, as well as
event-series constructed from the syslogs of the provider network
devices.
We ﬁrst observe a high degree of sparsity for each type of trou-
ble ticket – a small portion of customers have communicated with
the IPTV provider about performance issue that results in a ticket
created. Moreover, there is little repetition of tickets at each in-
dividual customer. We cannot directly apply the correlation and
causality analysis for individual customers as it does not provide
sufﬁcient statistical signiﬁcance. Both observation call for a multi-
(spatial) resolution heavy hitter detection approach, which allows
us to quickly focus on a spatial region in which the given type of
trouble ticket is prevalent, applicable for correlation and causality
analysis. Fortunately, such capability is handily available in Giza.
Hierarchical heavy hitter detection results. Table 5 shows at
the four different levels of spatial aggregation and for ten different
types of customer trouble tickets, the customer coverage ratio – the
percentage of the total number of customers in the identiﬁed heavy
hitter locations (top table), and the symptom coverage ratio – the
percentage of the total number of symptom events in the identiﬁed
heavy hitter locations (bottom table). We have used the detection
thresholds that corresponds to 1% at the distribution tail for Table 5.
Note that we use 0 to denote the case in which no heavy hitter can
be identiﬁed at the given spatial level.
We observe that for the ticket types of DVR, equipment, and re-
mote control, there is hardly any heavy hitters identiﬁed, indicated
by the extremely low number of customer coverage. This makes
sense since these problems should be independent of any network
components that the DVR, STB, or remote control associates to,
and hence are expected to be distributed evenly at random over spa-
tial locations. For the rest types of customer ticket, there are some
level of spatial concentration observed. In these cases, Giza is able
to identify a small number of heavy hitter locations. Comparing the
symptom coverage ratios to their corresponding customer coverage
ratio, we ﬁnd that those heavy hitter locations indeed experience
the symptom problem much more severely – it may be due to a
faulty network component, an undesirable protocol condition, etc.,
at the speciﬁc heavy hitter locations. With the help of hierarchical
heavy hitter detection in Giza, operators can then quickly focus on
these few locations to investigate the root causes in detail. There are
sufﬁcient concentration of symptom problems at these locations, to
which statistical correlation and causality analysis in the Giza tool
suite can then be applied.
Correlation results. We now try to discover dependency to the
various types of customer ticket using the correlation engine in
Giza. We ﬁrst create a composite time series for each type of trou-
ble tickets at each heavy-hitter location – the value of the time series
being the total count of symptom tickets associated in the sub-tree
of the heavy-hitter location during the time bin, or in the binary ver-
sion, the value being the predicate of whether there is at least one
symptom ticket in the sub-tree during the time bin. Since customer
tickets are entered manually into the system, the time reported on
the ticket can be signiﬁcantly delayed from the time at which per-
formance problem has started (by from few minutes to few hours).
In our experiments, we use a time lag of four hours as the correla-
tion margin. That is, we look for co-occurrences between trouble
tickets and other event-series within a four-hour window. The cor-
relation algorithm then outputs event-series pairs that manifest a
strong statistical correlation.
Fig. 11 illustrates some strong statistical dependencies between
different types of customer trouble tickets and various STB Crash,
STB Reset and events extracted from provider network syslogs. An
edge in the graph indicates the presence of strong statistical corre-
lation between the pair of event series. For example, trouble tickets
related to live TV video, digital video recording (DVR), video on
demand (VoD), and games have strong statistical correlations with
both STB crashes and resets. Some of the correlations can be ex-
plained by user’s response in trying to resolve the service problem –
considering the case when a STB crash causes service interruption

or performance degradation, customer resets the STB in the hope
of clearing the problem; when this fails to work, the customer calls
service center, triggering a service ticket created; operators con-
sequently perform certain diagnosis routine remotely, which may
produce more STB resets/reboots. While such correlation may be
less interesting from operator’s point of view, the correlation for
each subtype of STB crashes (captured in the crash logs) would
offer insight for debugging STB software. Moreover, we also dis-
cover some signiﬁcant correlations of several type of tickets (such
as HD, Audio, Live TV video, and Games) to the provider network
side events (such as link downs, SAP/SDP state changes, multicast
neighbor loss, and MPLS path re-routes) – we will examine the
causal graph of these network side events in Section 4.4. Know-
ing these dependencies allows us to better understand the impact
of various network side issue on customer perceived performance.
It also helps in identifying signature for network problems, which
customer care personnel needs to be informed of, so that they can
communicate better to customers complaining about certain type of
problems.
Validation against mitigation action. Customer care tickets also
record the mitigation actions taken in resolving the reported prob-
lem. Although there are many different mitigation actions, for sim-
plicity, we classify them into three main categories: user interface
related (e.g., adjusting TV or volume settings, replacing remote
control), home network related (e.g., residential gateway resets, re-
placing set top boxes), and provider network related (e.g., mainte-
nance or outage).
Table 6 shows how the mitigation actions for each type of trouble
tickets are distributed (in percentage) across different categories.
We ﬁnd the result very much echos our statistical correlation re-
sult using Giza. For example, trouble tickets about parental control
are typically resolved by explaining the service features to the cus-
tomer (87% in user interface category). Thus they do not have any
signiﬁcant correlation with either home network events or provider
network events. Tickets on remote control problem are least likely
to relate to a provider network issue (1.2%). Consistently, Giza
reports no correlation between the two. On the other hand, video
on demand tickets have many escalation to network care operators
(39%), which supports the high correlation score identiﬁed in Giza.
