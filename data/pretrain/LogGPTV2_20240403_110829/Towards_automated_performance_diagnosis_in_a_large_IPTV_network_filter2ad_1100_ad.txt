**4.3 Validation by Operational Experiences**

We describe our experiences in applying Giza to the data collected from an IPTV network (both the provider network and the customer home network) over a one-month period in 2008. We demonstrate how the suite of techniques in Giza can help in managing and diagnosing issues in the IPTV network.

#### 4.3.1 Customer Trouble Tickets

We focus on customer trouble tickets logged by the IPTV network operators. Each ticket indicates a performance-related issue reported by a customer and the time it was reported. The reported problems are categorized into ten types of performance issues: live TV video, audio, digital video recording (DVR), equipment, high definition, video-on-demand (VoD), parental control, program guide, remote control, and games. For each type, we create a symptom event-series and correlate it with other event-series in the home networks, such as STB crashes, STB resets, and RG reboots, as well as event-series constructed from the syslogs of the provider network devices.

**Observations:**
- **Sparsity:** Each type of trouble ticket is reported by a small portion of customers, and there is little repetition of tickets at the individual customer level. This sparsity makes direct correlation and causality analysis for individual customers statistically insignificant.
- **Heavy Hitter Detection:** To address this, we use a multi-spatial resolution heavy hitter detection approach, which allows us to quickly focus on spatial regions where a given type of trouble ticket is prevalent. This capability is available in Giza.

**Results:**
- **Customer Coverage Ratio:** Table 5 shows the percentage of the total number of customers in the identified heavy hitter locations at four different levels of spatial aggregation (DSLAM, CO, Metro, and Region) for ten different types of customer trouble tickets.
- **Symptom Coverage Ratio:** Table 5 also shows the percentage of the total number of symptom events in the identified heavy hitter locations.

**Key Findings:**
- **DVR, Equipment, and Remote Control:** These ticket types have no significant heavy hitters, indicating that these issues are evenly distributed and not associated with specific network components.
- **Other Ticket Types:** For the remaining types, Giza identifies a few heavy hitter locations. These locations experience the symptom problem more severely, suggesting potential faulty network components or undesirable protocol conditions.

**Correlation Results:**
- **Composite Time Series:** We create a composite time series for each type of trouble ticket at each heavy-hitter location. The value of the time series is the total count of symptom tickets in the sub-tree of the heavy-hitter location during the time bin, or a binary version indicating whether there is at least one symptom ticket in the sub-tree.
- **Time Lag:** Since customer tickets are entered manually, the reported time can be significantly delayed. We use a time lag of four hours as the correlation margin to look for co-occurrences between trouble tickets and other event-series.

**Dependencies:**
- **Fig. 11:** Illustrates strong statistical dependencies between different types of customer trouble tickets and various STB crashes, STB resets, and events extracted from provider network syslogs. For example, trouble tickets related to live TV video, DVR, VoD, and games have strong correlations with both STB crashes and resets.
- **User Response:** Some correlations can be explained by user responses, such as resetting the STB when experiencing service interruptions or performance degradation. If this fails, the customer contacts the service center, leading to the creation of a service ticket.

**Validation Against Mitigation Actions:**
- **Mitigation Categories:** Customer care tickets record the mitigation actions taken to resolve the reported problems. We classify these actions into three categories: user interface related, home network related, and provider network related.
- **Table 6:** Shows the distribution of mitigation actions across different categories for each type of trouble ticket. The results echo the statistical correlation findings from Giza. For instance, parental control tickets are typically resolved by explaining service features (87% in the user interface category), while VoD tickets often escalate to network care operators (39%), supporting the high correlation score identified in Giza.

This validation helps in understanding the impact of various network issues on customer-perceived performance and aids in identifying signatures for network problems, enabling better communication with customers.
