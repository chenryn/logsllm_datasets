Question: You are tasked with securing a hardware system against authentication bypass vulnerabilities. You suggest funneling all access through a single choke point as a mitigation strategy. What is the primary advantage of this approach, and what could be a potential disadvantage?
"A": "Advantage: Simplifies access control checks; Disadvantage: May introduce a single point of failure.",
"B": "Advantage: Allows for multiple authentication pathways; Disadvantage: Increases the complexity of access control.",
"C": "Advantage: Reduces the need for an allowlist; Disadvantage: Decreases the security by limiting access checks.",
"D": "Advantage: Ensures multiple checkpoints for authentication; Disadvantage: Reduces system performance due to multiple checks."
Answer: A
