Table 1: The different trafﬁc exchanges offer different levels of service. For example, the Basic service at eBesucher is free, allows geo-
targeting, but will not allow anonymous or custom referer-ﬁelds, while the premium service costs 2.90AC per month and allows custom and
anonymous referers. † indicates that the exchange offers geo-targeting at the granularity of China vs. Non-China. ‡ indicates the exchange
does not offer setting a referer value, and we lack visibility to comment on the default value. ∓ indicates the exchange ratio decreases with
the number of website “slots” used (see below). UL indicates Unlimited. ‘–’ indicates that the exchange does not offer the feature at any
membership level.
(6–20s) for all service levels, and do not offer randomizing
the length of the views. Among the advanced autosurf ex-
changes, Jingling offers the shortest views (view-length of
20–40s) for a free account, but offers longer views at an ad-
ditional cost. HitLeap offers a maximum of 60s view time,
and provides the option of randomizing the time for each
view. eBesucher, Otohits and EnhanceViews Autowatcher
offer longer views (2m–10m), but all views are of the same
length. Longer views cost more on all exchanges.
• User-Agent: This option is only offered by advanced auto-
surf exchanges. Both Otohits and Jingling offer conﬁguring a
custom User-Agent. Others do not speciﬁcally offer this op-
tion. However, based on the trafﬁc we bought (which we dis-
cuss later in Section 6), we observe HitLeap and eBesucher,
by default, use a variety of User-Agents, whereas Jingling, by
default, provides only various versions of Internet Explorer.
We lack visibility for EnhanceViews Autowatcher; we did
not buy any trafﬁc from this exchange because directing au-
tosurf trafﬁc to YouTube potentially raises ethical concerns.
• Anonymous/Custom Referer: This option is also only of-
fered by advanced autosurf exchanges; the manual and basic
autosurf exchanges send the link of the exchange itself as
referer. All advanced autosurf exchanges except Enhance-
Views Autowatcher offer sending a custom referer for the
view requests at an additional cost (see Table 1 for details).
HitLeap and eBesucher also charge for hiding the default
referer which indicates the views come from the trafﬁc ex-
change. Jingling by default does not send a referer. Ob-
viously a user-agent or referer ﬁeld that indicates the click
comes from a trafﬁc exchange would allow a website to eas-
ily ﬁlter the autosurf trafﬁc.
• Geo-Targeting: Geo-targeting refers to advertising the page
for viewing to exchange members residing in a speciﬁc loca-
tion. eBesucher and EasyHits4U offer geo-targeting at the
country-level as well as at a coarser granularity of conti-
nents. Jingling offers geo-targeting at a coarse granularity
of China and Non-China, and city-level granularity within
China. Others do not offer any geo-targeting.
4.3 Buying views from the exchange
The exchanges also sell trafﬁc views directly, i.e., one can get
trafﬁc by paying, instead of by earning exchange credits via surf-
ing/running their autosurf tool. The price per 100K views with
a view-length of 15s ranges between $2–60 for the generic au-
tosurf exchanges. Views on manual and social media promo-
tion exchanges cost more; 100K views cost $450 on EasyHits4U,
and $1,000 on HitSafari. Similarly, the cost for 100K 15s-long
YouTube views on EnhanceViews Autowatcher is $375. (The ex-
changes sell views in bulk, with discounts for packages with higher
views).
5. POPULAR TARGETS IN THE EX-
CHANGES
In order to develop insight into the popular domains in these ex-
changes, we captured a snapshot of the websites in circulation in
the exchanges. We did so by milking: retrieving the instructions
from the exchanges on the URLs to view, but not performing the
action. In this section, we discuss our milking infrastructure, the

Table 2: Dataset obtained by milking the autosurf trafﬁc exchanges,
i.e., collecting the lists of URLs to be clicked but not sending
clicks. We collected the data for manual exchanges manually, solv-
ing CAPTCHAs.
datasets we collected, and analysis on the popular categories of
monetization observed in these exchanges.
5.1 Dataset
In all the autosurf exchanges we study, the communication with
the exchange is unencrypted, enabling us to easily write our own
milker bots that replicate this communication and receive instruc-
tions from the exchange. The instructions contain the URL(s) to
be viewed, visit-length, and the referer to use in the view request
(if offered by the exchange). We ran these milker bots from 25–50
different IP addresses per exchange via a proxy.
Using the above infrastructure, we collected month-long datasets
for all autosurf exchanges, except for EnhanceViews Autowatcher.
Since the latter only offers visits to a pre-deﬁned list of social
networks/user-content websites, we do not carry out the domains
analysis for this exchange.
Instead, we collected a week-long
dataset for EnhanceViews Autowatcher’s YouTube Watcher tool to
compare the characteristics of video URLs in this exchange with
those in the other generic exchanges we study. For the manual ex-
changes, which require a CAPTCHA to be solved between consec-
utive page views, we collected smaller datasets by manually surﬁng
on the exchanges.
Table 2 describes the datasets we collected. For the manual
exchanges, EasyHits4U and HitSafari, we solved 70 CAPTCHAs
each. Each click resulted in the display of the main target page, as
well as one display and one text ad. We also manually clicked on
the display and text ads (see below), resulting in a total of 210 web
page visits on each of the two exchanges. For autosurf exchanges,
our milker bots recorded between 8.5K–104M page impression re-
