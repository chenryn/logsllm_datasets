ksetup mapuser
Maps the name of a Kerberos principal to an account.
Syntax
ksetup /mapuser  
Parameters
Parameter
Description
Specifies the fully-qualified domain name of any principal user. For example, mike@corp.CONTOSO.COM. If you don't specify an account parameter, mapping is deleted for the specified principal.
Specifies any account or security group name that exists on this computer, such as Guest, Domain Users, or Administrator. If this parameter is omitted, mapping is deleted for the specified principal.
Remarks
An account can be specifically identified, such as Domain Guests, or you can use a wildcard character (*) to include all accounts.
The computer only authenticates the principals of the given realm if they present valid Kerberos tickets.
Whenever changes are made to the external Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the realm configuration, a restart of the computer where the setting was changed is required.
Examples
To see the current mapped settings and the default realm, type:
ksetup
To map Mike Danseglio's account within the Kerberos realm CONTOSO to the guest account on this computer, granting him all the privileges of a member of the built-in Guest account without having to authenticate to this computer, type:
ksetup /mapuser PI:EMAIL guest
To remove the mapping of Mike Danseglio's account to the guest account on this computer to prevent him from authenticating to this computer with his credentials from CONTOSO, type:
ksetup /mapuser PI:EMAIL
To map Mike Danseglio's account within the CONTOSO Kerberos realm to any existing account on this computer, type:

To map all accounts within the CONTOSO Kerberos realm to any existing account of the same name on this computer, type:
ksetup /mapuser * *
