# Securing identity with Zero Trust
:::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-identity-medium.png":::
**Background** 
Cloud applications and the mobile workforce have redefined the security perimeter. Employees are bringing their own devices and working remotely. Data is being accessed outside the corporate network and shared with external collaborators such as partners and vendors. Corporate applications and data are moving from on-premises to hybrid and cloud environments. Organizations can no longer rely on traditional network controls for security. Controls need to move to where the data is: on devices, inside apps, and with partners.
Identities, representing people, services, or IoT devices, are the common dominator across today's many [networks](https://aka.ms/ZTNetwork), [endpoints](https://aka.ms/ZTDevices), and [applications](https://aka.ms/ZTApplications). In the Zero Trust security model, they function as a powerful, flexible, and granular way to control access to [data](https://aka.ms/ZTData).
**Before an identity attempts to access a resource, organizations must:**
-   Verify the identity with strong authentication.
-   Ensure access is compliant and typical for that identity.
-   Follows least privilege access principles.
Once the identity has been verified, we can control that identity's access to resources based on organization policies, on-going risk analysis, and other tools.
## Identity Zero Trust deployment objectives
   Before most organizations start the Zero Trust journey, their approach to identity is problematic in that the on-premises identity provider is in use, no SSO is present between cloud and on-premises apps, and visibility into identity risk is very limited.
         When implementing an end-to-end Zero Trust framework for identity, we recommend you focus first on these initial deployment objectives:
	     I. Cloud identity federates with on-premises identity systems.
         II. Conditional Access policies gate access and provide remediation activities.
	     III. Analytics improve visibility.
         After these are completed, focus on these additional deployment objectives:
         IV. Identities and access privileges are managed with identity governance.
         V. User, device, location, and behavior is analyzed in real time to determine risk and deliver ongoing protection.
         VI. Integrate threat signals from other security solutions to improve detection, protection, and response.
## Identity Zero Trust deployment guide
This guide will walk you through the steps required to manage identities following the principles of a Zero Trust security framework.
[!INCLUDE [H2 heading, Initial deployment objectives](../includes/deployment-objectives-initial.md)]
### I. Cloud identity federates with on-premises identity systems
Microsoft Entra ID enables strong authentication, a point of integration for endpoint security, and the core of your user-centric policies to guarantee least-privileged access. Microsoft Entra Conditional Access capabilities are the policy decision point for access to resources based on user identity, environment, device health, and risk—verified explicitly at the point of access. We will show how you can implement a Zero Trust identity strategy with Microsoft Entra ID.

#### Connect all of your users to Microsoft Entra ID and federate with on-premises identity systems
Maintaining a healthy pipeline of your employees' identities and the necessary security artifacts (groups for authorization and endpoints for extra access policy controls) puts you in the best place to use consistent identities and controls in the cloud. 
Follow these steps:
1.  [Choose an authentication option](https://aka.ms/auth-options). Microsoft Entra ID provides you the best brute force, DDoS, and password spray protection, but make the decision that's right for your organization and your compliance needs.
2.  Only bring the identities you absolutely need. For example, use going to the cloud as an opportunity to leave behind service accounts that only make sense on-premises. Leave on-premises privileged roles behind.
3.  If your enterprise has more than 100,000 users, groups, and devices combined [build a high performance sync box](https://aka.ms/aadconnectperf) that will keep your life cycle up to date.
#### Establish your Identity Foundation with Microsoft Entra ID
A Zero Trust strategy requires verifying explicitly, using least-privileged access principles, and assuming breach. Microsoft Entra ID can act as the policy decision point to enforce your access policies based on insights on the user, endpoint, target resource, and environment.
Take this step:
 - Put Microsoft Entra ID in the path of every access request. This connects every user and every app or resource through one identity control plane and provides Microsoft Entra ID with the signal to make the best possible decisions about the authentication/authorization risk. In addition, single sign-on and consistent policy guardrails provide a better user experience and contribute to productivity gains.
#### Integrate all your applications with Microsoft Entra ID
Single sign-on prevents users from leaving copies of their credentials in various apps and helps avoid users get used to surrendering their credentials due to excessive prompting.
Also make sure you do not have multiple IAM engines in your environment. Not only does this diminish the amount of signal that Microsoft Entra ID sees, allowing bad actors to live in the seams between the two IAM engines, it can also lead to poor user experience and your business partners becoming the first doubters of your Zero Trust strategy.
Follow these steps:
1.  [Integrate modern enterprise applications](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/plan-sso-deployment) that speak OAuth2.0 or SAML.
2.  For Kerberos and form-based auth applications, [integrate them using the Microsoft Entra application proxy](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-deployment-plan).
3.  If you publish your legacy applications using application delivery networks/controllers, use Microsoft Entra ID to [integrate](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/secure-hybrid-access) with most of the major ones (such as Citrix, Akamai, and F5).
4.  To help discover and migrate your apps off of ADFS and existing/older IAM engines, review [resources and tools](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/migration-resources).
5.  [Power push identities into your various cloud applications](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-auto-user-provisioning). This gives you a tighter identity lifecycle integration within those apps.

#### Verify explicitly with strong authentication
Follow these steps:
1.  [Roll out Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (P1)](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted). This is a foundational piece of reducing user session risk. As users appear on new devices and from new locations, being able to respond to an MFA challenge is one of the most direct ways that your users can teach us that these are familiar devices/locations as they move around the world (without having administrators parse individual signals).
2.  [Block legacy authentication](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication). One of the most common attack vectors for malicious actors is to use stolen/replayed credentials against legacy protocols, such as SMTP, that cannot do modern security challenges.
### II. Conditional Access policies gate access and provide remediation activities
Microsoft Entra Conditional Access (CA) analyzes signals such as user, device, and location to automate decisions and enforce organizational access policies for resource. You can use CA policies to apply access controls like multifactor authentication (MFA). CA policies allow you to prompt users for MFA when needed for security and stay out of users' way when not needed.
:::image type="content" source="../media/diagram-conditional-access-policies.png" alt-text="Diagram of Conditional Access policies in Zero Trust." border="false":::
Microsoft provides standard conditional policies called [security defaults](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) that ensure a basic level of security. However, your organization may need more flexibility than security defaults offer. You can use Conditional Access to customize security defaults with more granularity and to configure new policies that meet your requirements.
Planning your Conditional Access policies in advance and having a set of active and fallback policies is a foundational pillar of your Access Policy enforcement in a Zero Trust deployment. Take the time to configure your trusted IP locations in your environment. Even if you do not use them in a Conditional Access policy, configuring these IPs informs the risk of Identity Protection mentioned above.
Take this step:
 - Check out our [deployment guidance](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access) and [best practices](https://aka.ms/resilientaad) for resilient Conditional Access policies.
#### Register devices with Microsoft Entra ID to restrict access from vulnerable and compromised devices
Follow these steps:
1.  [Enable Microsoft Entra hybrid join](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid) or [Microsoft Entra join](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid). If you are managing the user's laptop/computer, bring that information into Microsoft Entra ID and use it to help make better decisions. For example, you may choose to allow rich client access to data (clients that have offline copies on the computer) if you know the user is coming from a machine that your organization controls and manages. If you do not bring this in, you will likely choose to block access from rich clients, which may result in your users working around your security or using shadow IT.
2.  Enable the [Intune](/mem/intune/remote-actions/device-management) service within Microsoft Endpoint Manager (EMS) for managing your users' mobile devices and [enroll devices](/mem/intune/enrollment/device-enrollment). The same can be said about user mobile devices as about laptops: The more you know about them (patch level, jailbroken, rooted, etc.), the more you are able to trust or mistrust them and provide a rationale for why you block/allow access.
