Question: A hardware engineer suggests that to prevent untrusted agents from exploiting aliased memory regions, it is sufficient to implement a single memory protection unit (MPU) with a default deny policy for all addresses beyond the explicitly allowed ranges. Why might this strategy not be sufficient for addressing the vulnerability described in CWE 1257?
"A": "A default deny policy does not prevent an untrusted agent from accessing aliased memory regions if the address decoder ignores higher order address bits.",
"B": "A single MPU cannot provide adequate protection if memory aliases are created intentionally by a malicious agent altering the memory region sizes.",
"C": "Implementing a default deny policy could lead to performance degradation due to the overhead of processing access requests for each address.",
"D": "The default deny policy could be circumvented if the MPU itself is faulty or corrupted, allowing unrestricted access to all memory regions."
Answer: AB
