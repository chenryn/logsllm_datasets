User: How to detect and fix SQL injection vulnerabilities?
Assistant: SQL injection is a common web security vulnerability. Attackers can execute malicious SQL queries, access, modify, and delete sensitive data by injecting abnormal statements. The following are suggestions for SQL injection vulnerability detection and repair: 1. SQL injection vulnerability detection: 1. Manual testing Manual testing tests whether malicious SQL injection is allowed by entering specific characters or character combinations into the website form. 2. Tool-assisted testing SQL injection scanners can help automatically detect possible vulnerabilities, such as SQLmap, Netsparker, etc. 3. Prevent error and exception information In the production environment, ensure that error and exception information is not exposed to users, but recorded in the log. 4. Prevent SQL injection in comments If your website has a comment area or information submission form, please ensure that the input data is reviewed and filtered to prevent malicious injection. 2. Repair of SQL injection vulnerabilities: 1. Parameterized query statement The use of parameterized query statement can prevent injection attacks, which can prevent malicious data from becoming part of query parameters. 2. Filter input Effectively filter the content entered by the user to prevent the insertion of SQL or javascript injection fragments. 3. Authority control Each user should have their own authority, and according to their authority to limit their access to the database. 4. Upgrades and Patches Ensure that the database software and the environment in which applications are running are always kept up-to-date, and update all database-related software and tools to close all possible vulnerabilities.
