On numpy current master (`da6e4c7`), np.matmul is apparently not using BLAS:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.random.rand(5, 512, 512)
    >>> %timeit np.matmul(x, x)
    1 loops, best of 3: 526 ms per loop
    >>> def xmul(a, b):
    ...     out = np.empty_like(a)
    ...     for j in range(a.shape[0]):
    ...         out[j] = np.dot(a[j], b[j])
    ...     return out
    >>> %timeit xmul(x, x)
    10 loops, best of 3: 28 ms per loop
Of course, it's a preliminary feature, but probably best to have an issue for
this.
