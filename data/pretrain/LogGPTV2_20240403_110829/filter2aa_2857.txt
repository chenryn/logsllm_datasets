The call is coming from inside the 
house! 
Are you ready for the next 
evolution in DDoS attacks?

The Promises of IoT
• The Promise of IoT
• More personalized, automated 
services
• Better understanding of customer 
needs
• Optimized availability and use
of resources
• Resulting in:
• Lower Costs
• Improved Health
• Service / efficiency gains
• Lower environmental impact
3
The IoT Problem – Security 
• To fulfill these premises, 
IoT devices are usually:
• Easy to Deploy
• Easy to Use
• Require Minimal 
Configuration 
• Low Cost
• However…
4
Unprecedented DDoS attack sizes
The Results: Large Scale Weaponization
of Vulnerable IoT Devices
Mirai infections December 2016
•
1M login attempts from 11/29 to 12/12 from 92K 
unique IP addresses
•
More than 1 attempt per minute in some regions
5
The Situation Today…
• An unprotected IoT device 
on the Internet will get 
infected within 1 minute.
• An IoT device located 
behind a NAT device or a 
Firewall is not accessible 
from the Internet and is 
therefore (mostly) secure. 
• But early 2017, this all 
changed…

WINDOWS-BASED
IoT INFECTION
7
Background
• Desktop malware spreading multi-platform malware is not new
• Increasingly common technique amongst both targeted malware
and crimeware, primarily focusing on mobile devices
• HackingTeam RCS
• WireLurker
• DualToy
• “BackStab” campaign
• Banking trojans will also target mobile devices to steal 2FA / SMS authorization 
codes
• May consist of a side-load installation or tricking a user to click a link
on their phone
• IOT devices present a new and ripe infection vector
• “Windows Mirai” is the first known multi-platform trojan to target IoT devices
for infection
8
“Windows Mirai”
• Initially reported on in early 2017 by PAN
• Later reported on by multiple organizations
• Not truly a Windows version of Mirai, spread other Linux / IoT malware 
previously
• Discovered samples dating back to at least March 2016
• Earliest seen version by ASERT is 1.0.0.2 which was used to spread a Linux 
SOCKS Trojan
• Latest known version is 1.0.0.7
• Earlier versions discovered via re-used PE property names
• Properties combined with recognizable network traffic helped to discover
the early versions of the trojan
• Appears to be Chinese in origin, not nation-state related

WM Scanning & Spreading
• Spreads to Windows by
• Brute-forcing MySQL and MSSQL credentials and injecting stored procedure 
calls which will download and install the Trojan
• Also attacks RDP (not in early versions) and WMI
• Spreads to Linux / IoT via 
• Brute-force attacks against Telnet and SSH
• Use ‘wget’ or ‘tftp’ to download IoT malware loader
• Newer versions can also echo the loader stored as a resource in the PE file
• Not currently known to use any IoT exploits to spread like other Mirai variants
11
WM Version 1.0.0.5 - 7
• Has used multiple different CnC hosts, none of which have been active 
except during a brief 1 week period back in February.
• Spreads and installs Mirai loader via
• Wget
• TFTP
• Echo across SSH/Telnet (later versions)
• Mirai loader is stored as a PE resource
• Each supported architecture is stored as a different resource
• Architectures are iterated through to determine the correct resource to load
• Uses “ECCHI” as busybox marker string
• Mirai CnC was hardcoded to cnc[.]f321y[.]com:24 – down when we discovered
• Hardcodes DNS to 114[.]114[.]114[.]114 – popular CN-based public DNS server

ELF Mirai Loader as a PE Resource
13
WM 1.0.0.7 Debug Logging Strings FTW!
14
WM Version 1.0.0.7
• Installation and Updating
• The trojan will first retrieve a text 
file containing update instructions
• First line in the update file will be 
a URL and a local path to install 
to.
• The URL is a legitimate image
of Taylor Swift with a PE file 
appended
• Second line is a windows
batch file 
• The trojan then checks its current 
version against a different 
URL(/ver.txt)
• If a newer version is detected,
it is downloaded and installed
15
WM Delivered via Taylor Swift

WM 1.0.0.7 Batch File
17
WM WPD.dat
• The WPD.dat file is believed to be
a configuration file
• The expected MD5 of the file is first retrieved
to verify the download
• ASERT believes it is used to 
• Determine scanning modules to use
• Address ranges to scan
• List of usernames + passwords to be used 
for brute-forcing
• Commands to execute
• ASERT did not successfully decode or 
decrypt the file or retrieve from memory
while it was still live 
• Subsequent attempts after the fact also
did not yield success
• By default, WM will scan the local /24 subnet

IMPLICATIONS & 
CONSEQUENCES

Implications & Potential Consequences
• The Zombie horde
A single infected Windows computer has now the 
capability to infect and subvert the ”innocent” IoT 
population into zombies, all under the control of the 
attacker.
• The attackers weapon arsenal
The attacker can now use the zombies to:
1. Infect other IoT devices.
2. Launch outbound attacks against external 
targets.
3. Perform reconnaissance on internal networks, 
followed by targeted attacks against internal 
targets.

1. Scanning for Devices to Infect
22
1. Scanning for Devices to Infect
The Scanning activity generates:
• Flood of ARP requests
• Lots of small packets, including TCP SYN’s
• As more devices get infected, the scanning 
activity will increase, potentially causing serious 
issues and outages with network devices like 
firewalls, switches and other stateful devices.
• These kinds of outages have repeatedly 
happened in the wild, both during the NIMDA, 
Code Red and Slammer outbreaks in 2001 and 
also recently during large scale Mirai infections 
at large European Internet Service Providers.
23
2. Launching Outbound DDoS Attacks
24
2. Launching Outbound DDoS Attacks
• Attack activity generates a lot of traffic. 
Mirai can for example launch:
• UDP/ICMP/TCP packet flooding
• Reflection attacks using UDP packets
with spoofed source IP addresses
• Application level attacks (HTTP/SIP 
attacks).
• Pseudo random DNS label prefix attacks 
against DNS servers. 
• This attack traffic will quickly fill up any 
internal WAN links and will also will cause 
havoc with any stateful device on the 
path, including NGFWs.

3. Reconnaissance & Internally Facing Attacks

3. Reconnaissance & Internally Facing Attacks
• A clever attacker would scan the internal 
network to identify vulnerable services and 
network layout.
• He would then launch attacks against the 
routing tables to shut out NOC/SOC services, 
followed by DDoS attacks against internal 
services.
• This would be devastating as if there are no 
internal barriers in place, the network would 
simply collapse.
• After a while, the clever attacker would then 
stop the attack and send a ransom e-mail, 
asking for his BTC’s…
27
Are IoT Devices Capable of Causing
So Much Harm?
• First, lets look at the anatomy of a typical 
network device. It has a:
• Fast path
• Slow path
• And there are 4 main groups of packets
to be handled:
• Transit packets
• Received packets (for the device)
• Exception packets
• Non-IP packets
• If an attacker can force the device to spend 
cycles on processing packets, it wont have 
cycles to send or process critical packets!

A carefully crafted 300pps flood against 
typical (unsecured) high-end routers / 
switches will cause those to lose their 
routing adjacencies…

Defending Against Insider Threats
• Internet Service Providers have successfully been dealing with similar attacks
for the last 20 years by following what's called Security Best Current Practices 
(BCP’s). These basically translate into “Keep the network up and running!”
• Service Providers have followed a 6 phase methodology when dealing
with attacks:
• Preparation: Prepare and harden the network against attack.
• Identification: Identify that an attack is taking place.
• Classification: Classify the attack.
• Traceback: Where is the attack coming from.
• Reaction: Use the best tool based on the information gathered from the Identification, 
Classification and Traceback phases to mitigate the attack.
• Post-mortem: Learn from what happened, improve defenses against future attacks. 
30
Defending Against Insider Threats
• These Security Best Practices include:
• Implementing full Network segmentation and harden (or isolate) 
vulnerable network devices and services.
• Developing a DDoS Attack mitigation process.
• Utilizing flow telemetry to analyze external and internal traffic.  
This is necessary for attack detection, classification and trace 
back.
• Deploying a multi-layered DDoS protection.
• Scanning for misconfigured and abusable services, this includes 
NTP, DNS and SSDP service which can be used for amplification 
attacks.
• Implementing Anti-Spoofing mechanisms such as Unicast 
Reverse-Path Forwarding, ACLs, DHCP Snooping & IP Source 
Guard on all edge devices.
31
Summary
• The attackers are now inside the house!
The Windows spreader has opened up the possibility
to infect internal IoT devices and use them against you.
• Internal network defenses and security 
architectures need to be adapted to meet this 
new threat.
Stateful devices will collapse both due to persistent 
scanning active and also when DDoS attacks are 
launched.
• Implementing Security BCP’s will help
Using Security BCP’s will reduce the impact of internal 
DDoS, in addition this will help to help to secure 
networks against other security threats as well.
