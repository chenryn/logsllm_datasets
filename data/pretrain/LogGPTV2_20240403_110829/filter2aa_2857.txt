## The Call is Coming from Inside the House!
Are you prepared for the next evolution in DDoS attacks?

## The Promise of IoT
- **Personalized, Automated Services:** IoT promises more personalized and automated services.
- **Better Understanding of Customer Needs:** Enhanced insights into customer needs and preferences.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Efficient use and availability of resources.
- **Resulting Benefits:**
  - Lower Costs
  - Improved Health
  - Service and Efficiency Gains
  - Reduced Environmental Impact

## The IoT Problem – Security
To fulfill these promises, IoT devices are typically:
- Easy to Deploy
- User-Friendly
- Require Minimal Configuration
- Cost-Effective
- However, this ease of use and deployment often comes at the cost of security.

## Unprecedented DDoS Attack Sizes
### Large-Scale Weaponization of Vulnerable IoT Devices
- **Mirai Infections (December 2016):**
  - Over 1 million login attempts from November 29 to December 12, originating from 92,000 unique IP addresses.
  - Some regions experienced more than one attempt per minute.

## The Current Situation
- An unprotected IoT device on the internet can be infected within one minute.
- An IoT device behind a NAT or firewall is not directly accessible from the internet and is generally considered secure.
- However, in early 2017, the landscape changed significantly.

## Windows-Based IoT Infection
### Background
- Desktop malware that spreads multi-platform malware is not new.
- Common techniques include targeting mobile devices, such as HackingTeam RCS, WireLurker, DualToy, and the "BackStab" campaign.
- Banking trojans also target mobile devices to steal 2FA/SMS authorization codes.
- IoT devices present a new and vulnerable infection vector.
- "Windows Mirai" is the first known multi-platform trojan to target IoT devices for infection.

### "Windows Mirai"
- Initially reported by PAN in early 2017 and later by multiple organizations.
- Not a true Windows version of Mirai but previously spread Linux/IoT malware.
- Discovered samples date back to at least March 2016.
- Earliest version (1.0.0.2) was used to spread a Linux SOCKS Trojan.
- Latest known version is 1.0.0.7.
- Identified through reused PE property names and recognizable network traffic.
- Appears to be of Chinese origin, not nation-state related.

### WM Common PE File Info Properties
- CompanyName: Someone
- FileDescription: Someone To Do
- FileVersion: 1.0.0.X
- InternalName: WPD.exe
- OriginalFilename: WPD.exe
- ProductName: SomeoneSomeThing
- ProductVersion: 1.0.0.X

### WM Scanning & Spreading
- **Windows Infection:**
  - Brute-forces MySQL and MSSQL credentials, injecting stored procedure calls to download and install the Trojan.
  - Attacks RDP and WMI.
- **Linux/IoT Infection:**
  - Brute-force attacks against Telnet and SSH.
  - Uses `wget` or `tftp` to download IoT malware loader.
  - Newer versions can echo the loader stored as a resource in the PE file.
  - Does not use IoT exploits to spread like other Mirai variants.

### WM Version 1.0.0.5 - 7
- Used multiple CnC hosts, none active except for a brief period in February.
- Spreads and installs Mirai loader via `wget`, `tftp`, and SSH/Telnet.
- Mirai loader is stored as a PE resource, with each supported architecture as a different resource.
- Uses “ECCHI” as a busybox marker string.
- Mirai CnC hardcoded to cnc[.]f321y[.]com:24, which was down when discovered.
- Hardcodes DNS to 114[.]114[.]114[.]114, a popular CN-based public DNS server.

### ELF Mirai Loader as a PE Resource

### WM 1.0.0.7 Debug Logging Strings

### WM Version 1.0.0.7
- **Installation and Updating:**
  - Retrieves a text file containing update instructions.
  - First line: URL and local path to install.
  - URL is a legitimate image of Taylor Swift with a PE file appended.
  - Second line: Windows batch file.
  - Checks current version against a different URL (`/ver.txt`).
  - If a newer version is detected, it is downloaded and installed.

### WM Delivered via Taylor Swift

### WM 1.0.0.7 Batch File

### WM WPD.dat
- Believed to be a configuration file.
- Verifies the download using the expected MD5 hash.
- Used to determine scanning modules, address ranges, usernames, passwords, and commands.
- ASERT did not successfully decode or decrypt the file or retrieve it from memory while it was live.
- By default, WM scans the local /24 subnet.

## Implications & Consequences
### The Zombie Horde
- A single infected Windows computer can now infect and subvert IoT devices into zombies, all under the attacker's control.
- The attacker can use these zombies to:
  1. Infect other IoT devices.
  2 - Launch outbound attacks against external targets.
  3. Perform reconnaissance on internal networks, followed by targeted attacks against internal targets.

### A Typical Mid-Enterprise Network
- Bad Guys
- Security Stuff

### Scanning for Devices to Infect
- Generates a flood of ARP requests and small packets, including TCP SYN.
- As more devices get infected, scanning activity increases, potentially causing issues and outages with network devices like firewalls, switches, and other stateful devices.
- Such outages have occurred during NIMDA, Code Red, Slammer outbreaks in 2001, and recently during large-scale Mirai infections at European ISPs.

### Launching Outbound DDoS Attacks
- Attack activity generates significant traffic, including UDP/ICMP/TCP packet flooding, reflection attacks, application-level attacks, and pseudo-random DNS label prefix attacks.
- This traffic quickly fills internal WAN links and causes havoc with stateful devices, including NGFWs.

### Reconnaissance & Internally Facing Attacks
- A clever attacker would scan the internal network to identify vulnerable services and network layout.
- Launches attacks against routing tables to shut out NOC/SOC services, followed by DDoS attacks against internal services.
- If there are no internal barriers, the network will collapse.
- After a while, the attacker may stop the attack and send a ransom email demanding BTC.

### Are IoT Devices Capable of Causing So Much Harm?
- Network devices have a fast path and slow path.
- Handle four main groups of packets: transit, received, exception, and non-IP.
- If an attacker forces the device to process packets, it won't have cycles to send or process critical packets.
- A carefully crafted 300pps flood against typical unsecured high-end routers/switches can cause them to lose their routing adjacencies.

### Learning from History: Implementing a Layered Defense
- Internet Service Providers have dealt with similar attacks for 20 years by following Security Best Current Practices (BCPs).
- Six-phase methodology for dealing with attacks:
  1. Preparation: Harden the network.
  2. Identification: Detect the attack.
  3. Classification: Classify the attack.
  4. Traceback: Determine the attack source.
  5. Reaction: Mitigate the attack.
  6. Post-mortem: Improve defenses.

### Defending Against Insider Threats
- BCPs include:
  - Full network segmentation and hardening.
  - DDoS attack mitigation process.
  - Flow telemetry for attack detection, classification, and traceback.
  - Multi-layered DDoS protection.
  - Scanning for misconfigured and abusable services.
  - Anti-spoofing mechanisms.

### Summary
- The attackers are now inside the house! The Windows spreader has opened up the possibility to infect internal IoT devices and use them against you.
- Internal network defenses and security architectures need to be adapted to meet this new threat.
- Stateful devices will collapse due to persistent scanning and DDoS attacks.
- Implementing Security BCPs will help reduce the impact of internal DDoS and secure networks against other threats.
