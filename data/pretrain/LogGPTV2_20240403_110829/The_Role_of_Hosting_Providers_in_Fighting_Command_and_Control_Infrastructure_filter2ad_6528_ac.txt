we hypothesized that the rule of law index of a hosting
provider’s country might play a signiﬁcant role in explain-
ing the concentration of abuse in that country. Previous
work has shown that the location of banks targeted by Zeus
malware is not random [37]. Similarly, our dataset shows

that some C&Cs are hosted in several islands all around the
globe which are mostly the so-called tax-heavens. We exam-
ine this eﬀect by including the Rule of law index variable in
addition to the other previous 4 variables in model 5. We see
a clear negative relation between the rule of law index and
the concentration of C&Cs abuse. Although the Rule of law
index is a combination of several country-level regulation in-
dicators, it provides valuable insight about the proportion
of abuse in certain geographical locations.
With the ﬁtted values in our ﬁnal model – model 5 –, we
are able to explain approximately 72% of the observed vari-
ance (i.e., Pseudo R-squared = 0.72) in C&C counts only
through considering the size variables and the rule of law.
This highlights a very important point: regardless of the
security measures a provider has in place, certain charac-
teristics, driven by the nature of a provider’s business, are
driving the majority of the abuse.
Note we hypothesize that there are additional factors that
inﬂuence the concentration of C&C abuse in hosting provi-
ders such as variables that capture the business model of
a provider, for example price of the hosting service. How-
ever, such variables are much harder to collect at scale for all
hosting providers. In the next section, we assess the impact
of such factors on the concentration of C&C abuse within a
smaller sample of hosting providers.
4.3 Concentrations of C&Cs in a Sample of
Providers
As explained earlier, we collected additional business model
variables for a sample of providers 4.1. We initially started
from a set of 235 randomly selected providers for which we
collected price information, however due to missing values
in other variables we ended up with 85 providers for whom
we have data on all the four variables in this category.
Note that the downside of our sampling strategy is that
we might end up with geographical biases. In order to con-
trol for such eﬀects, we ﬁt a “ﬁxed-eﬀects” GLM model with
the count of C&C domains as dependent variable following
a Poisson distribution. We add a country ﬁxed eﬀect, δi,
by ﬁtting a separate dummy variable as a predictor for each
country. The country ﬁxed eﬀect prevents undue depen-
dence of the residuals.
Similar to before, we add the variables one by one to the
baseline model (model 1) to observe the extent to which a
model is improved in comparison to others. The resulting
models are shown in Table 4. Model 5 contains all of the 4
variables discussed before. In addition to those, in our ﬁnal
model, (model 6), we add the country ﬁxed-eﬀect variable
as well.
Inspecting the estimated coeﬃcients of model 6, we ob-
serve a signiﬁcant negative relation between price of hosting
and C&C counts. That is to say that if we were to increase
price by one unit while holding all other variables constant,
the C&C counts would be multiplied by e(−0.084) = 0.91 as
a result. The cheaper a providers price is, the more likely
it is for the hosting provider to host C&C domains. As ex-
pected, the variable ‘Best price’ shows a weaker relation in
model (5) where cross-country diﬀerences are not controlled
by the ﬁxed country eﬀects of model (6). This is because the
properties of hosting markets in diﬀerent countries can dif-
fer substantially, which then eventually inﬂuence the cost of
infrastructure in a country with respect to hosting services.
Moreover, the cost of a hosting plan is in proportion to the
economy of the provider’s country. Hence, our conversion of

Are long-lived C&Cs concentrated in certain providers?
Figure 7 depicts the distribution of the average uptime of
C&C domains per provider, for 2009-2016. Note that each
individual plot is also indicative of the amount of C&C do-
mains that are taken down in the corresponding year. What
is clear from all the plots is that, there is always a major-
ity of providers with a shorter uptime followed by a long
tail of providers hosting C&Cs with very long uptimes. In
some case there are examples of providers that hosts C&C
domains for more than a year. Assuming no measurement
errors are at play here, such examples could indicate igno-
rant or perhaps even bullet-proof hosting. This leads us to
the next question: are these providers preferred by attack-
ers?
5.2 Differences between C&C Take-down Speed
of Providers
prices in diﬀerent speciﬁc countries to USD, if not controlled
for the country diﬀerences, can be very crude.
The Variables ‘Vulnerable software ratio’ and ‘Popularity
index’ also show a signiﬁcant positive relation with C&C
counts. One unit increase in ‘Vulnerable software ratio’
while holding other variables constant, multiplies the C&C
counts by e(2.035) = 7.652. The ‘Time in business’ vari-
able shows a signiﬁcant positive relation with abuse as well,
indicating that well-known providers or those who are in
business for a longer time are attacked more. Please note
that this can partially be caused by the fact that our data
is longitudinal. In the following section, we will study the
eﬀect of C&C take-down speed on its concentration across
providers.
5. EFFECT OF C&C TAKE-DOWN SPEED
Up to this point, we have demonstrated that the con-
centration of C&C domains can be explained by structural
characteristics of providers, mostly related to their size and
business model. Together, these factors form a proxy for
the attack surface of the industry. The attack surface of
providers accounts for at least 72% of the variance in the
number of C&C in their networks. Providers with more
infrastructure get more C&C. This does not indicate selec-
tive location choices by the attackers. Quite the opposite,
in fact. The bulk of C&C can be explained from attackers
randomly distributing their C&C domains across the overall
global hosting infrastructure.
In this section, we investigate whether attackers prefer
providers who are lax in taking down C&C servers. Longer
uptime of C&Cs seems valuable for the attackers, so we
would expect higher C&C counts in those networks. We
examine if and how C&C uptimes inﬂuences the number of
servers at that provider. C&C uptime has been used in pre-
vious security research as a standard metric for studying the
lifetime of diﬀerent attack types [15].
We deﬁne the “uptime” of a C&C domain as the number
of days between the ﬁrst and last time the C&C domain is
observed online as reported by our datafeeds. Some of the
C&C domains remain online beyond the measurement pe-
riod, which unavoidably leaves their uptime unknown. The
average uptime of C&C domains is depicted in Figure 6.
There is no clear trend one way or the other. This also
suggests that there are no learning eﬀects among hosting
providers that enables faster takedown over time. We ﬁrst
examine if the average C&C uptime is driven by a few provi-
ders, or whether it reﬂects the overall performance of hosting
providers.
Figure 7: Distribution of C&C average uptime
hosted by providers over years
To examine the diﬀerences between providers more care-
fully, we model the survival rate S(t) of C&C domains using
a Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate which also allows to cor-
rectly account for the C&C domains that are not taken down
by the end of our measurement period, i.e., right-censored
data points [21]. The survival rate S(t) basically expresses
the probability that a C&C domain is online at a speciﬁc
time during the observation period.
Figure 8 displays the survival curves of C&C domains in
Figure 6: Mean uptime of C&C domains per year
582Figure 8: Kaplan-Meier estimated survival function

the top-10 providers with the highest number of C&C do-
mains in their network. Figure 9 depicts the χ2 value of
the Log-Rank test in which the providers are compared two
by two in terms of their survival rate. Only the light blue
tiles indicate non-signiﬁcant diﬀerences at a 0.05 signiﬁcance
level.
As both plot suggests, hosting providers perform diﬀer-
ently either in terms of survival probability or in terms of
the total number of days that their C&C domains remain
online. For example, more than 95% of the C&C domains in
Main Hosting Server are taken down after approximately
60 days which is very similar to HostDime.com. However
C&C domains hosted by HostDime.com are in total taken
down after maximum of 4 months whereas this takes about
more than a year for Main Hosting Server. On the extreme
side are providers such as Northen Telecom and eNom, in-
corporated that host C&C domains that are online for more
than 2 years.
5.3 Does C&C Uptime Explain Abuse Con-
centration?
Given that there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the C&C
uptime among hosting providers, we now analyze the im-
pact of C&C uptime on the concentration of C&C abuse
within providers. Do attackers prefer providers with long
C&C uptimes?
We ﬁt a similar GLM model to model 3 from Section 4.2
for the population of providers, having the count of C&C
domains following a Poisson distribution. The result of our
model with the addition of a C&C uptime variable is shown
in Table 5.3.
In order to be able to make a relative comparison, model 2
is the ﬁnal model from our inquiry into the structural prop-
erties of providers (see Table 3). We add the ‘Average C&C
uptime’ variable to that model. The resulting estimated
coeﬃcients are observable in model 3. The model suggests
that the variable ‘Average C&C uptime’ shows a statistically
signiﬁcant positive relationship with the number of C&Cs.
Although the relationship is signiﬁcant, we are only able to
explain a total of 73% variance of C&C abuse counts, which
is a 1% increase compared to the model with only structural
provider variables. This rather indicates that there is very
little or no preference by attackers for hosting their C&C
domains at providers who allow long-living C&C domains.

6. RELATED WORK
With the increasing number of attacks on ﬁnancial ser-
vices, eﬀorts from industry and academia have focused on
botnet evolution and mitigation strategies.
A ﬁrst area of research aims to understand the function-
ality of the diﬀerent malware families to develop counter-
measures that could disrupt these botnets. Diﬀerent studies
have investigated the communication protocols of these bot-
nets and their spreading techniques [20, 24, 27].
