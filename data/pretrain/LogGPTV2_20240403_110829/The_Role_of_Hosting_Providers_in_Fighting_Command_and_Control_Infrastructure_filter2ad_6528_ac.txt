### Hypothesis and Previous Work
We hypothesized that the Rule of Law index of a hosting provider’s country might significantly influence the concentration of abuse in that country. Previous research has shown that the location of banks targeted by Zeus malware is not random [37]. Similarly, our dataset reveals that some Command and Control (C&C) servers are hosted in various islands globally, primarily known as tax havens.

### Generalized Linear Regression Model (GLM)
Table 4 presents the results of a Generalized Linear Regression Model (GLM) for a sample of hosting providers, with the count of C&C domains as the response variable. The model uses a Poisson distribution with a log link function.

### Analysis of Rule of Law Index
Our analysis shows a clear negative relationship between the Rule of Law index and the concentration of C&C abuse. Although the Rule of Law index is a composite of several country-level regulatory indicators, it provides valuable insights into the proportion of abuse in specific geographical locations.

### Final Model and Pseudo R-squared
The final model (model 5) explains approximately 72% of the observed variance in C&C counts, considering the size variables and the Rule of Law. This highlights that certain characteristics, driven by the nature of a provider’s business, significantly influence the majority of the abuse, regardless of the security measures in place.

### Additional Factors and Business Model Variables
We hypothesize that additional factors, such as the business model of a provider (e.g., price of hosting service), may also influence the concentration of C&C abuse. However, collecting these variables at scale for all hosting providers is challenging. In the next section, we assess the impact of such factors on a smaller sample of hosting providers.

### Concentrations of C&Cs in a Sample of Providers
We collected additional business model variables for a sample of 85 providers. We initially started with 235 randomly selected providers but ended up with 85 due to missing data. To control for geographical biases, we fit a "fixed-effects" GLM model with the count of C&C domains as the dependent variable, following a Poisson distribution. We add a country fixed effect, δi, by fitting a separate dummy variable for each country.

### Impact of Price and Other Variables
Model 6, which includes the country fixed-effect, shows a significant negative relationship between the price of hosting and C&C counts. A one-unit increase in price, while holding other variables constant, multiplies the C&C counts by e^(-0.084) = 0.91. Cheaper providers are more likely to host C&C domains. The 'Best price' variable shows a weaker relationship in model 5, where cross-country differences are not controlled. This is because the properties of hosting markets in different countries can vary substantially, influencing the cost of infrastructure and the economy of the provider's country.

### C&C Uptime and Survival Analysis
To investigate whether attackers prefer providers who are lax in taking down C&C servers, we examine the uptime of C&C domains. We define "uptime" as the number of days between the first and last time a C&C domain is observed online. The average uptime of C&C domains is depicted in Figure 6, showing no clear trend, suggesting no learning effects among hosting providers over time.

Figure 7: Distribution of C&C average uptime hosted by providers over years

To examine differences between providers, we use a Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate to model the survival rate S(t) of C&C domains, accounting for right-censored data points. Figure 8 displays the survival curves of C&C domains for the top-10 most attacked hosting providers, and Figure 9 depicts the χ2 value of the Log-Rank test, comparing providers two by two in terms of their survival rate.

### Impact of C&C Uptime on Abuse Concentration
We fit a similar GLM model to model 3 from Section 4.2, adding the 'Average C&C uptime' variable. The resulting model suggests a statistically significant positive relationship between 'Average C&C uptime' and the number of C&Cs. However, the model only explains a total of 73% variance of C&C abuse counts, indicating little or no preference by attackers for providers with long-living C&C domains.

### Related Work
With the increasing number of attacks on financial services, efforts from industry and academia have focused on botnet evolution and mitigation strategies. Studies have investigated the communication protocols and spreading techniques of botnets, and collected data on C&C and other botnet infrastructure. For example, Rossow et al. [33] analyzed the lifetime and domain name characteristics of malware downloaders, observing steady migrations and redundant deployments across providers. Han et al. [16] investigated how cybercriminals abuse public resources.
