User: I have made a program that takes infrared values serially, transmits them them to another program(the one im having trouble with), and uses the win32 python api to react to a matched value. It all works, but I need this program to run on the startup of my computer.
It uses the IDLE python shell to run, and I need to open/run the file directly from that program. Is there any way to do this? I can't just put a shortcut into the startup directory because its an unrecognized file, and it needs to be run, not just opened. Any help would be great, thanks!
Assistant: It sounds like your actual problem is just that you didn't put the right extension on the file.
Just rename it to, e.g., script.py, or script.pyw, and, unless you've changed the settings from the default, that should open the file with the command-line or windowed Python launcher, which will just run it.
If you've changed your settings so .py files open in IDLE instead of in the Python launcherâ€¦ is there a reason you want those weird settings? If not, just undo it.
