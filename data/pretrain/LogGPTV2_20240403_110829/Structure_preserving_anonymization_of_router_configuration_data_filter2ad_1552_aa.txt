Abstract
A repository of router con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les from production
networks would provide the research community with a trea-
sure trove of data about network topologies, routing designs,
and security policies. However, con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les have been
largely unobtainable precisely because they provide detailed
information that could be exploited by competitors and at-
tackers. This paper describes a method for anonymizing
router con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les by removing all information that
connects the data to the identity of the originating network,
while still preserving the structure of information that makes
the data valuable to networking researchers. Anonymizing
con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les has unusual requirements, including pre-
serving relationships between elements of data, anonymizing
regular expressions, and robustly coping with more than 200
versions of the con(cid:12)guration language, that mean conven-
tional tools and techniques are poorly suited to the prob-
lem. Our anonymization method has been validated with
a major carrier, earning unprivileged researchers access to
the con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les of more than 7600 routers in 31 net-
works. Through example analysis, we demonstrate that the
anonymized data retains the key properties of the network
design. We believe that applying our single-blind methodol-
ogy to a large number of production networks from di(cid:11)erent
sources would be of tremendous value to both the research
and operations communities.

INTRODUCTION
By far the best source of design information available to-
day for an IP network is the running con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les asso-
ciated with its routers.1 Each of these (cid:12)les, known as \con-
(cid:12)gs", contains the complete set of commands used to de(cid:12)ne
the behavior of a single router. Access to the router con-
(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les of production networks would bring tremen-
dous bene(cid:12)ts to a wide group of networking researchers. For
example, an accurate network topology can typically be di-
rectly derived from the con(cid:12)gs. The parameters governing
the intricate interactions among routing protocols and poli-
cies that could only be estimated otherwise are explicit in
the con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les, making it possible to develop more
precise analysis techniques for evaluating essential network
properties such as the robustness of the routing design [1].
However, con(cid:12)gs are held as closely-guarded secrets for
the exact same reasons that make them valuable for re-
search. They reveal internal details of the network design,
and expose business secrets such the owner’s organizational
structure and clientele. Further, they expose potentially em-
barrassing con(cid:12)guration mistakes and security vulnerabili-
ties that could be remotely exploited. Only if the link be-
tween the con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les and the identity of the network
owner is severed can it be guaranteed that any information
learned from the con(cid:12)gurations cannot be exploited against
the owner. Therefore, before public access to the con(cid:12)gs of
production networks becomes feasible, a method must be in-
vented to anonymize the data. However, the anonymization
must preserve relationships within the information to retain
the data’s value for networking researchers.
In this paper, we present a detailed formulation of this
con(cid:12)guration anonymization problem. We qualify the two
1Ultimately, we believe that researchers should not need to
work at the level of the con(cid:12)gs themselves, but with a higher-
level representation that abstracts away the idiosyncrasies
of particular con(cid:12)guration languages and exposes the crit-
ical information. However, developing such a data model
is an extremely di(cid:14)cult task, one that must be driven and
validated by examples of how con(cid:12)gurations are used in real
networks. We see our work as the (cid:12)rst logical stepping stone
to the creation of a high-level representation of con(cid:12)guration
data.
equally important but often competing requirements { owner-
identity anonymization and relationship preservation { and
outline a methodology to validate that they are met. We
identify key challenges in developing an acceptable anony-
mization method and consider potential attacks against it.
Guided by this formulation, we have crafted a (cid:12)rst working
method for con(cid:12)g anonymization2.
Anonymizing con(cid:12)gs is challenging for several reasons:
First, there are numerous ways in which con(cid:12)gs can leak in-
formation that would allow an attacker to break the anony-
mization. For example, public AS numbers and IP addresses
can be easily connected with the owner. Even the number
and location of peering points to other networks that can
be gleaned from con(cid:12)gs might uniquely identify a network.
Second, there is no consistent grammar for the con(cid:12)guration
language, so conventional compiler tools and techniques are
poorly suited to the problem. Third, the anonymization
needs to support a diverse set of research goals. Fourth, the
anonymization process must be fully automated to avoid
human errors and gain the acceptance of network operators.
The anonymization method described in this paper makes
an important step towards overcoming these challenges. It
has been validated with a major carrier, earning unprivi-
leged researchers access to the con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)les of more
than 7655 routers in 31 backbone and enterprise networks.
2. THE NATURE OF CONFIGURATION
FILES
Figure 1 shows command lines like those found in a pre-
anonymized con(cid:12)guration (cid:12)le. Typical con(cid:12)gs in production
networks vary from 50 to 10,000 lines | in our dataset of
7655 routers, the 25th percentile was 183 lines and 90th
percentile was 1123 lines.
Lines 8{14 de(cid:12)ne two interfaces and assign them IP ad-
dresses, with free text comments used to indicate where
these interfaces connect. Line 16 de(cid:12)nes a BGP process
and con(cid:12)gures it as a speaker for the public Autonomous
System Number (ASN) 1111. Lines 18{20 declare an EBGP
session with a router at 66.253.160.68, presumably inside
the UUNET network as the remote AS has UUNET’s ASN
(701). Lines 22{28 de(cid:12)ne the route-maps used by BGP in
terms of the access-lists de(cid:12)ned in lines 30{32. Line 30 se-
lects IP addresses matching 1.1.1/24. Line 31 uses a regular
expression to match any BGP community attribute value
coming from UUNET (701) between 7100 and 7599, and
line 32 uses another regular expression to match any AS
path that contains AS 1239, or one of UUNET’s non-US
ASs (702-705).
The con(cid:12)g illustrates several common relationships be-
tween information elements. The uses relationship between
the BGP process in line 19 and the routing policy de(cid:12)nition
in lines 22{25 is established by the name \UUNET-import".
The RIP routing protocol in line 35 is con(cid:12)gured to run over
the interface in line 8 by the subnet contains relationship
between the pre(cid:12)x 1.0.0.0/8 and the address 1.1.1.1.
Anonymizing this con(cid:12)guration requires removing or trans-
forming: (1) the comments; (2) the owner’s public AS num-
ber (here 1111) (3) the publicly routable IP addresses (e.g.,
1.1.1/24), all of which directly identify Foo Corp; and (4) all
2We have implemented our approach for Cisco IOS, but the
techniques are directly applicable to JunOS and other router
con(cid:12)guration languages as well.
