4. Configure forwarding options:
• Configure global port-mirroring properties to mirror family vpls traffic to an interface on the
bridge domain bd_port_mirror.
• Configure the next-hop group nhg_mirror_to_bd to forward Layer 2 traffic to the bridge domain
bd_next_hop_group.
Both of these forwarding options will be referenced by the port-mirroring firewall filter:
[edit]
forwarding-options {
port-mirroring { # Global port mirroring properties.
input {
rate 1;
}
family vpls {
output {
interface lt-2/0/10.2; # Interface on ’bd_port_mirror’ bridge domain.
no-filter-check;
}
}
}
next-hop-group nhg_mirror_to_bd { # Configure a next-hop group.
group-type layer-2; # Specify ’layer-2’ for Layer 2; default ’inet’ is for Layer 3.
interface ge-2/0/2.0; # Interface on ’bd_next_hop_group’ bridge domain.
interface ge-2/2/9.0; # Interface on ’bd_next_hop_group’ bridge domain.
}
}

5. Configure two Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filters for family bridge traffic:
• filter_pm_bridge—Sends all family bridge traffic to the global port mirroring destination.
• filter_redirect_to_nhg—Sends all family bridge traffic to the final next-hop group
nhg_mirror_to_bd.
Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filters for family bridge traffic applies to traffic on a physical interface
configured with encapsulation ethernet-bridge.
[edit]
firewall {
family bridge {
filter filter_pm_bridge {
term term_port_mirror {
then port-mirror;
}
}
filter filter_redirect_to_nhg {
term term_nhg {
then next-hop-group nhg_mirror_to_bd;
}
}
}
}

Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Remote Destination by Using Destination as VLAN
You configure port mirroring on an EX9200 switch to send copies of traffic to an output destination,
such as an interface, a routing-instance, or a VLAN; and for the input traffic, you can configure a firewall
filter term with various match conditions and actions.
When you configure VLAN as the output destination in a port-mirroring configuration, the traffic for
each port-mirroring session is carried over a user-specified VLAN that is dedicated for that mirroring
session in all participating switches. The mirrored traffic is copied onto that VLAN (also called as mirror
VLAN) and forwarded to interfaces, which are members of the mirror VLAN. The destination interfaces,
which are members of the mirror VLAN, can span across multiple switches in the network provided that
the same remote mirroring VLAN is used for a mirroring session in all the switches.
You can use the port-mirror or port-mirror-instance action in the firewall filter configuration when you
mirror traffic to remote destinations by configuring a VLAN as a port-mirroring output destination.
Configuration Layer 2 Port Mirroring to a Remote VLAN
IN THIS SECTION
Configuring Port Mirroring to a Remote VLAN | 1199
EX9200 switches enable you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy the following
packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering or exiting a VLAN
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
1199
• Disable port mirroring that you have configured when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input rather than specifying all interfaces as input in a port
mirroring configuration.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by:
• Using statistical sampling.
• Setting ratios to select statistical samples.
• Using firewall filters.
Configuring Port Mirroring to a Remote VLAN
To filter packets to be mirrored to a port-mirroring instance, create the instance and then use it as the
action in the firewall filter. You can use firewall filters in both local and remote mirroring configurations.
If the same port-mirroring instance is used in multiple filters or terms, the packets are copied to the
port-mirroring output port or port-mirroring VLAN only once.
To filter mirrored traffic, create a port-mirroring instance under the [edit forwarding-options] hierarchy
level, and then create a firewall filter. The filter can use any of the available match conditions and must
have port-mirror-instance instance-name as an action. This action in the firewall filter configuration
provides the input to the port-mirroring instance.
To configure a port-mirroring instance with firewall filters:
1. Configure the port-mirroring instance name and set the output destination to a VLAN:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set port-mirroring instance instance-name output vlan (vlan-ID | vlan-name)
For example, configure a port-mirroring instance employee-monitor and set the output destination to a
VLAN ID 999:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set port-mirroring instance employee-monitor output vlan 999
1200
2. Create a firewall filter by using any of the available match conditions and assign the port-mirroring
instance name as an action in the firewall filter configuration.
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch set filter filter-name term term-name from match-condition
user@switch set filter filter-name term term-name then match-condition
user@switch# set filter filter-name term term-namethen port-mirror-instance instance-name
For example, create a firewall filter called example-filter with two terms no-analyzer and to-analyzer, and
assign the to-analyzer term to the employee-monitor port-mirroring instance:
a. Create the first term to define the traffic that should not pass through to the port-mirroring
instance employee-monitor:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter (Firewall Filters) example-filter term no-analyzer from source-
address 192.0.2.14
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term no-analyzer from protocol tcp
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term no-analyzer then accept
b. Create the second term to define the traffic that should pass through to the port-mirroring
instance employee-monitor:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer from destination-port 80
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer then port-mirror-instance employee–
monitor
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter example-filter term to-analyzer then accept
3. Apply the firewall filter to an interface or VLAN that provides input to the port-mirroring instance.
To apply a firewall filter to an interface:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces interface-name unit 0 family ethernet-switching filer (input |
output) filter-name
1201
To apply a firewall filter to a VLAN:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlan (vlan-ID or vlan-name) filter (input | output) filter-name
For example, to apply the example-filter firewall filter to the ge-0/0/1 interface:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input example-
filter
For example, to apply the example-filter filter to the source-vlan VLAN:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlan source-vlan filter input example-filter

Mirroring Employee-to-Web Traffic for Remote Analysis | 1203
Verification | 1209
EX9200 switches enable you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering or existing a VLAN
You can analyze the mirrored traffic by using a protocol analyzer application running on a remote
monitoring station if you are sending mirrored traffic to an analyzer VLAN.
This topic includes two related examples that describe how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch
to the remote-analyzer VLAN so that you can perform analysis from a remote monitoring station. The first
example shows how to mirror all traffic entering the ports connected to employee computers. The
1202
second example shows the same scenario but includes a filter to mirror only the employee traffic going
to the Web.
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
• Disable your configured mirroring sessions when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by using firewall filters.
This example describes how to configure remote mirroring:
Requirements
Before you configure remote mirroring, be sure that:
• You have an understanding of mirroring concepts.
• The interfaces that port-mirroring will use as output interfaces have been configured on the switch.

Topology | 1203
This topic includes two related examples that describe how to configure mirroring to the remote-analyzer
VLAN so that analysis can be performed from a remote monitoring station. The first example shows how
to configure a switch to mirror all traffic from employee computers. The second example shows the
same scenario, but the setup includes a filter to mirror only the employee traffic going to the Web.
Figure 44 on page 1203 shows the network topology for both these example scenarios.

Figure 44: Remote Mirroring Network Topology Example
In this example:
1. Interface ge-0/0/0 is a Layer 2 interface, and interface ge-0/0/1 is a Layer 2 interface (both
interfaces on the source switch) that serve as connections for employee computers.
2. Interface ge-0/0/10 is a Layer 2 interface that connects the source switch to the destination switch.
3. Interface ge-0/0/5 is a Layer 2 interface that connects the destination switch to the remote
monitoring station.
4. VLAN remote-analyzer is configured on all switches in the topology to carry the mirrored traffic.

Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure port mirroring of all traffic from the two ports connected to employee computers to the
remote-analyzer VLAN for use from a remote monitoring station:
1. On the source switch:
a. Configure the employee-web-monitor port-mirroring instance:
[edit ]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching port mode access
user@switch# set forwarding-options port-mirroring instance employee-web-monitor output
vlan 999
b. Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
c. Configure the interface to associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
d. Configure the firewall filter called watch-employee:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from destination-address
192.0.2.16/28
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from source-address
192.0.2.16/28
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp then accept
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web from destination-port 80
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web then port-mirror-instance
employee-web-monitor
In this configuration, the employee-to-corp term defines that traffic from destination-address
192.0.2.16/28 and source address 192.0.2.16/28 can be accepted to pass through the switch, and the
employee-to-web term defines that traffic from port 80 must be sent to the port-mirroring instance
employee-web-monitor.
1206
e. Apply the firewall filter to the employee interfaces:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
user@switch# set ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
2. On the destination switch:
• Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
• Configure the interface on the destination switch for access mode and associate it with the remote-
analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode access
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
• Configure the interface connected to the destination switch for access mode and associate it with
the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/5 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode access
user@switch# set ge-0/0/5 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
