User: i have searched through many python issues and none seem to help me with mine or i just don't understand it enough to resolve the issue. basically i am trying to learn python so in the process on my mac i have installed serveral versions and had many version issues which so far i have been able to resolve by looking up ways to resolve it. however i am now at a part in head first python that needs to install google app engine the book is a good bit out of date so i installed the latest app engine and made the symbolic links but when i run the application the browser is greyed out. i have seen many references to dev_appserver.py in my long search to resolve this. i cannot my this file anywhere on my machine so i presume i have an issue with my install of python2.7 i have re-installed and then uninstalled and re-installed python 2.7 over and over but still cannot find the dev_appserver.py file . does anyone have a concrete way to ensure dev_appserver.py will be installed. thanks in advance from a seriously frustrated python beginner.
Assistant: On my PC it is found under this directory:
C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Google\Cloud SDK\google-cloud-sdk\platform\google_appengine
I would assume that on Apple OS it will be similar based on where you decided to install the Cloud SDK.
