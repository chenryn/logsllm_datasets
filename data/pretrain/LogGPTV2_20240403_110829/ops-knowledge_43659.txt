User: I have an Intellij 15 Python project created using the Python plugin. I'm on OSX and have the Project Python SDK set to /usr/bin/python. I've got another developer on my team that is on Windows and his SDK is at C:\Python27\Python.exe
Is there any way I can share this project via source control without us both stepping over each other toes each time I update and need to change the SDK?
Assistant: You can always put your .idea folder into .gitignore (or equivalent for your VS) file and prevent sharing it between systems and developers.
If you don't have project-specific settings there - it's recommended way to do it.
