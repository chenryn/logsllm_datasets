User: I am attempting to write a bash shell script that will evaluate the modified date of a file on a remote web site and download the file if it is more recent than the local copy.  Part of the script is already written.  The part that has been developed uses the header Last-Modified parameter.   I need to have an alternative in case the Last-Modified parameter is not available in the header.  Does anyone know of a way using bash shell scripting or python to get the last modified date of as file on a website without using the Last-Modified parameter in the header?
Thanks.

Assistant: If you're retrieving data over http, there is no guarantee that what you're requesting corresponds to a physical file or anything else with a concept of a "last modified" date, so within the http protocol there's no way (other than Last-Modified) to know. You will probably want to retrieve the file if you don't have a sufficiently recent local copy - and you will have to decide for your purposes what "sufficiently recent" is. 
If you have a user account on the host and can remotely log in via ssh or similar, it may be possible to inspect an actual file for mod date.
