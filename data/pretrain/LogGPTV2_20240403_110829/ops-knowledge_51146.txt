User: Just wondering how to store files in the google app engine datastore.
There are lots of examples on the internet, but they are using blobstore
I have tried importing db.BlobProperty, but when i put() the data
it shows up as a <Blob> i think. It appears like there is no data
Similar to None for a string
Are there any examples of using the Datastore to store files
Or can anyone point me in the right direction
I am new to programming, so not to complex, but I have a good
hang of Python, just not an expert yet.
Thanks for any help
Assistant: Datastore has a limit on the size of objects stored there, thats why all examples and documentation say to use the blobstore or cloud storage. Do that.
