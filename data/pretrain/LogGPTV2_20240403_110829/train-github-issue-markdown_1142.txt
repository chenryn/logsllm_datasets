Hello, could it be possible to add one or two additional variables to the
onResourceReady callback, which states whether the image was downloaded or
loaded from cache?
For example:
    //final int FROM_INTERNET=0;
    //final int FROM_CACHE=1;
    //final int FROM_EXTERNAL=2;
    Glide.with(c).load(url).listener(new RequestListener(){
        @Override
        public boolean onLoadFailed(@Nullable GlideException e, Object model, Target target, boolean isFirstResource) {
            return false;
        }
        @Override
        public boolean onResourceReady(Drawable resource, Object model, Target target, DataSource dataSource, boolean isFirstResource, int loadedFrom, String loadPath) {
            Log.d("MainActivity","loadedFrom: "+loadedFrom+", loadPath: "+loadPath);
            // loadedFrom could return: 0 (downloaded), 1 (from cache), 2 (from external storage?), etc.
            // loadPath could return: url (for 0), path to cache (for 1), path to external location (for 2), etc.
            return false;
        }
    })
Glide version: 4.11.0

Why: I simply want to know whether an image has been downloaded or fetched
from cache when loaded. I've read and tried to implement
onlyRetrieveFromCache(true) with custom target and listener, and it's not
reliable, convenient, or efficient for checking it.
