User: For a certain application, we need to perform security hardening. Please list the common types of security vulnerabilities and corresponding hardening measures.
Assistant: The common types of security vulnerabilities and corresponding hardening measures are as follows: 1. SQL injection vulnerability: By entering malicious SQL statements, sensitive data in the application is directly or indirectly obtained. Hardening measures include filtering input parameters, using parameterized queries, restricting database user permissions, etc. 2. XSS vulnerability: An attacker enters a malicious script into the application and makes the user execute the script in the browser to obtain sensitive information or perform some malicious operations. Reinforcement measures include restricting input, filtering output, prohibiting the execution of certain JavaScript functions, and using HTTPOnly Cookies. 3. CSRF vulnerability: Attackers forge user requests, send malicious requests to the application, and perform some unauthorized operations. Reinforcement measures include using verification codes, adding random tokens, verifying Referer, etc. 4. File upload vulnerability: Attackers can obtain sensitive information or execute attacks by uploading files containing malicious code. Reinforcement measures include file type verification, limit the size of uploaded files, save uploaded files in a specified directory, etc. 5. Password security vulnerabilities: including weak passwords, passwords stored in plain text, password reset vulnerabilities, etc. Reinforcement measures include encrypting passwords, limiting the length and complexity of passwords, and prohibiting users from reusing passwords. 6. Unauthorized access vulnerability: An attacker can access unauthorized resources by bypassing the access control mechanism of the application. Reinforcement measures include mandatory access control checks, permission control, etc. 7. Sensitive information leakage vulnerability: including leakage of sensitive information through logs, error messages, response headers, etc. Reinforcement measures include reasonable management of log information, limiting the output of error information, etc.
