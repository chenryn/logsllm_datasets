creating different anomalies. This result is due to a limitation of
our system, which monitors networks for a limited time period
of seven days. Second, other cases were mistakenly ﬂagged
as suspicious due to inaccuracies in traceroute measurements,
such as traceroutes cluttered with many non-responsive IP
hops ("*"). Consequently, we concluded that 64 cases out of
437 were found to have likely been hijacked3 for the reasons
detailed below.
We found out that all these 64 remaining cases shared a
common routing behavior: they appeared to be routed during
the ﬁrst one to six days of the monitoring period and then
permanently disappeared from the routing tables. As a result
all these cases exhibit similar routing anomalies triggered by
the signiﬁcant difference in control plane and data plane routes
at the time and after the block was routed.
64 IP address ranges were found to have been hijacked
between January 2013 and June 2014. After examining the
routing history of these blocks, we could classify them further
into two different categories:
•
•
PREFIX HIJACK VIA VALID UPSTREAM: In 92% of the
hijacks, the IP address ranges were allocated but (1)
unannounced by the time they were hijacked (i.e., left
idle by their valid owner), and the attacker forged part
of the BGP AS path to advertise the IP ranges using
an (2) invalid BGP origin AS via a (3) valid direct
upstream provider (ﬁrst hop) AS.
AS HIJACK VIA ROGUE UPSTREAM: In 8% of the
hijacks, the IP address ranges were allocated but (1)
unannounced and the attacker forged part of the BGP
AS path to advertise the IP address ranges using the
(4) valid BGP origin AS but via an (5) invalid direct
upstream provider (ﬁrst hop) AS.
(1) Unannounced IP address space: The routing history
revealed that all hijacked preﬁxes were unannounced before
being hijacked.
(2)-(4) (In)valid BGP origin AS: In this work, we consider
the origin AS for an IP address range as valid if the IP address
range is mapped to the origin AS in the IRRs (whois) and
the IP address range owner is also the same as the origin AS
owner.
(3)-(5) (In)valid direct upstream provider AS: In this work,
we consider as invalid the AS a1 appearing as the direct
upstream provider of the origin AS a0 in the BGP AS path
{an, ..., a1, a0} if all the following conditions are met: (1) it
has never been used as a direct upstream provider AS for

talk about hijacks and attacker instead of candidate hijacks and likely attacker

ASes of a0 and does not have a0 in the list of its customers
(i.e., imports/exports) published in the whois when such
information was provided, (3) it is not used as an upstream
provider to advertise any non hijacked IP address range at the
time it is observed in the hijacks, (4) it is unused when it is
observed for the ﬁrst time in hijacks, (5) its holder refers to an

it
In the AS hijack cases,
thus appears that attackers
actually forged part of the BGP AS path ({a1, a0}) by unau-
thorisedly using a1 and a0 in the BGP announcements for the
different hijacked IP preﬁxes. BGP hijacking using a forged
AS path is a stealthy BGP hijack technique [23], [39] and
was probably used by the attackers in an effort not to raise
suspicion.
