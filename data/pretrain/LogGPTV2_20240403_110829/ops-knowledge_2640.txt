User: I've looked around for an answer to this, but i don't know how to phrase it in a way that google will understand.
I'm trying to learn Python, and i've installed it on my machine. However, when i just type "python" in cmd.exe, the python app is not found/launched.
I have to manually go to the directory in which python.exe is found in order to run my python commands. Is this normal? Online tutorials seem to indicate that I should be able to run the app from anywhere :s
I'm on Win7, and trying to run Python from the Django stack by BitNami.

Add python to your environment path. You should then be able to use it anywhere.
