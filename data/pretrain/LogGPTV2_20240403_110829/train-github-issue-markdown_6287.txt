# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I would like to be able to bind PowerToys Run to windows key + f.
# Description of the new feature/enhancement
I would like this because ctrl F is most other ' normal' searches. The windows
system wide equivalent should be able to be bound to windows key + f in my
opinion.
# What should be changed
Allow the windows key to be mapped as a PowerToys Run command starting button
e.g. windows key + f, to mimmic ctrl + f.
