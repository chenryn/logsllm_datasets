### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
I would like to be able to bind PowerToys Run to the Windows key + F.

### Description of the New Feature/Enhancement
I believe this change is necessary because the Ctrl + F key combination is commonly used for searching within most applications. To maintain consistency and improve usability, the system-wide search function in PowerToys Run should be accessible via the Windows key + F. This would align with the familiar Ctrl + F shortcut and provide a more intuitive user experience.

### Proposed Changes
- Allow the Windows key to be mapped as a starting key for PowerToys Run.
- Specifically, enable the binding of Windows key + F to launch PowerToys Run, mimicking the functionality of Ctrl + F for a more consistent and user-friendly experience.
