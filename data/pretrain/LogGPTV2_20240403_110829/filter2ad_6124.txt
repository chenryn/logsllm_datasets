Two  main  leading  communication  technologies

These  two  technologies  have  two  different  and

1. What are the challenging issues of reflecting and 
estimating  the  contribution  of  the  various  network 
and  protocol  levels  of  resiliency  to  the  service 
availability and reliability? 
2. How to aggregate the complexity and interactions 
from four levels of networking functions (Physical, 
link, network and transport layers) and work with a 
viable  model  that  reflects  the  networking  system 
behavior  from  the  service  provider  and  the  service 
user standpoints? 
3.  How  to  account  for  the  interaction  between 
reliability and performance i.e. when modeling and 
estimating network reliability how to account for the 
failure/repair  behavior  and  demonstrate  an  SLA  is 
met under a given engineered bandwidth?
