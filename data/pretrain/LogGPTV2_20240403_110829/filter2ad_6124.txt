### Abstract

In today's interconnected networking systems, two leading communication technologies—switching and routing—coexist and are converging. These technologies have distinct yet complementary approaches to fault detection and recovery. Switching is primarily concerned with sensitivity to delays and connectivity, while routing resiliency focuses on traffic losses and traffic integrity.

This workshop investigates the issues and challenges associated with ensuring that a multi-service, converged networking system meets stringent reliability requirements to fulfill service level agreements (SLAs). Specifically, the workshop will address the following questions:

1. **Resiliency Contribution:** What are the key challenges in reflecting and estimating the contribution of various network and protocol levels of resiliency to service availability and reliability?
2. **Modeling Complexity:** How can we aggregate the complexity and interactions from the four levels of networking functions (Physical, Link, Network, and Transport layers) and develop a viable model that reflects the networking system behavior from both the service provider and user perspectives?
3. **Reliability and Performance Interaction:** How can we account for the interaction between reliability and performance, particularly when modeling and estimating network reliability? How do we demonstrate that an SLA is met under a given engineered bandwidth?

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to foster cross-fertilization and strong collaboration. The aim is to find practical and viable solutions to these challenging questions.
