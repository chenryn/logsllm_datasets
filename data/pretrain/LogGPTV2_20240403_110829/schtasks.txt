schtasks commands
Schedules commands and programs to run periodically or at a specific time, adds and removes tasks from the schedule, starts and stops tasks on demand, and displays and changes scheduled tasks.
Note
The schtasks.exe tool performs the same operations as Scheduled Tasks in Control Panel. You can use these tools together and interchangeably.
Required permissions
To schedule, view, and change all tasks on the local computer, you must be a member of the Administrators group.
To schedule, view, and change all tasks on the remote computer, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the remote computer, or you must use the /u parameter to provide the credentials of an Administrator of the remote computer.
You can use the /u parameter in a /create or /change operation if the local and remote computers are in the same domain, or if the local computer is in a domain that the remote computer domain trusts. Otherwise, the remote computer can't authenticate the user account specified, and it can't verify that the account is a member of the Administrators group.
The task you plan to run must have the appropriate permission; these permissions vary by task. By default, tasks run with the permissions of the current user of the local computer, or with the permissions of the user specified by the /u parameter, if one is included. To run a task with permissions of a different user account or with system permissions, use the /ru parameter.
