User: Please write a Python script to monitor the specified log file and trigger DingTalk alarm notification when keywords appear.
Assistant: Due to the lack of specific log files and keywords, the following code only provides a template and needs to be modified as needed: ``` import os import time import requests # Dingding robot webhook address DINGDING_WEBHOOK = "https://oapi.dingtalk.com/ robot/send?access_token=xxxx" # Monitored log file path LOG_FILE_PATH = "/path/to/log_file" # Keyword to be monitored KEYWORD = "error" # Check the log file every second CHECK_INTERVAL = 5 # Last time The position read when checking the log file last_position = 0 def main(): global last_position while True: try: # Get the log file size file_size = os.path.getsize(LOG_FILE_PATH) # If the log file is updated if last_position < file_size: # Get the size of the new content size_diff = file_size - last_position # Read the new content with open(LOG_FILE_PATH, "rb") as f: f.seek(last_position) new_content = f.read(size_diff) # If the new content contains the key Word if KEYWORD in new_content.decode("utf-8"): # Send DingTalk message msg = { "msgtype": "text", "text": { "content": f"Keyword "{KEYWORD}" appears Please process it as soon as possible!" } } requests.post(DINGDING_WEBHOOK, json=msg) # Update last_position last_position = file_size except FileNotFoundError: print(f"The log file "{LOG_FILE_PATH}" does not exist, please check whether the path is correct.") break except Exception as e: print(f"An exception occurred: {e}") # Wait for a while before checking the log file time.sleep(CHECK_INTERVAL) if __name__ == "__main__": main()
