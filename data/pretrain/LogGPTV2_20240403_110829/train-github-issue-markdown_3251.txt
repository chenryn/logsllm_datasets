    Before filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since
    the latest release: run "hg pull -u" and retry what you did to
    reproduce the problem.  Thanks.
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. amd64, linux on a basic Gentoo install (nothing fancy or weird), gcc-4.4.4, multilib
    2. hg clone go
    3. cd go/src ; ./all.bash
    What is the expected output?
    Whatever success is!
    What do you see instead?
    --- cd cmd/ebnflint
    ebnflint -start="SourceFile"
    "/home/fafhrd/Projects/go/repos/go"/doc/go_spec.html
    make: *** [test] Segmentation fault
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    This is during install, so whatever that is internally (6g?); I tried with no GOARCH or
    GOOS and then GOARCH=amd64 and GOOS=linux.
    Which operating system are you using?
    Gentoo Linux. I have a very basic amd64 install. gcc-4.4.4 (gentoo -r2)
    Which revision are you using?  (hg identify)
    a7800e20064a tip
    Please provide any additional information below.
    I spent some time writing an ebuild for wider use. In my tests for seeing what files
    were needed (GOROOT v. GOROOT_FINAL), I noticed that godoc also segfaults -- this will
    end up being a different bug, I'm sure. ;-) However, it may be related.
    -----------
    Feel free to let me know about further system or debugging information you need. While
    I'm very new to Go, I generally know how to invoke and use various development tools --
    I just don't know what I'm looking for in this case.
