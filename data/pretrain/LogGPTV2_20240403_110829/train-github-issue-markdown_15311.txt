Subject: Potential Regression in Commit `7e87eb1` Regarding Request Format Handling

Hi,

In commit `7e87eb1`, which addresses the request format when duplicating a `Request` object, you force-set the request format if the parent is already `null`. 

However, when forwarding from one controller to another (or potentially other cases, which I haven't tested yet), it may be necessary to allow the request format to remain `null` and unbiased. Currently, due to the changes introduced by `7e87eb1`, if the request format is `null`, it is automatically set to an arbitrary default, specifically `html`. This behavior can render any attempt to determine the "correct" request format in the forwarded controller ineffective, as well as limit the ability to set a default format.

To work around this, a small hack can be implemented before the forward:

```php
// Set the request format to 'json' (or any other format except null)
$this->getRequest()->setRequestFormat('json');
$this->forward('Bundle:Action', ['param']);
```

While this workaround exists, I believe it is not ideal and does not align with the expected behavior of the framework. The request format, which in my case is managed by a view listener, should be left unchanged and unbiased, even if it is `null` by default.

I understand that the commit may have been made to address a specific need, but I am concerned that it could introduce a potential regression.
