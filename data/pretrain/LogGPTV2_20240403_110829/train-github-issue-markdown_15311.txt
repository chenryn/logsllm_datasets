Hi,
In the commit `7e87eb1`, which is fixing the request format when duplicating a
`Request` object, you forcefully set the request format if the parent is
already `null`.
The thing is, when forwarding in a controller to another controller (or maybe
something, I haven't tested for another case yet), you may need to let the
request format be `null` and unbiased.
Currently (brought by the commit `7e87eb1`), if the request format is null,
then it is set to an arbitrary default which is `html`... Which renders
useless any attempt to get the "correct" request format in the forwarded
controller, and the possibility to set a default.
This is easily manageable by doing a little hack before the forward :
    getRequestFormat('json'); // json example. could be whatever except null
            $this->forward('Bundle:Action', ['param']);
        }
    }
But still, I don't think this is what should be expected from the framework ;
the request format, which is in my case handled by a view listener should be
left as is and unbiased, even if it has a null value per default.
So, maybe this commit was made from a need, but still, I think this could be a
possible regression.
Cheers.
