# Summary
When deploying a Flutter application to an Android device with multiple user accounts, the app may be installed under a different user account than intended. This can lead to the appearance of a failed deployment if the active user is not the one where the app was installed.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Set up an Android device with multiple user accounts.
2. Build a Flutter application.
3. Run the command `flutter run`.
4. The deployment process may appear to hang or fail, depending on whether the targeted user has logged in. If the app is installed in a different user account, it will not be visible to the current user.

Upon checking the app via "Settings > Memory > Other apps," you may find that the app is marked as "not available for this user."

## Logs and Explanation
The verbose output from `flutter run --verbose` shows the following command being executed:
```sh
executing: C:\Users\Oliver\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools\adb -s BJ106805 shell am start -a android.intent.action.RUN -f 0x20000000 --ez enable-background-compilation true --ez enable-dart-profiling true klages.de.bla/klages.de.bla.MainActivity
```

This command is missing the `--user` parameter, which specifies the user account under which the app should be started. According to the ADB manual:
```
--user user_id | current: Specify which user to run as; if not specified, then run as the current user.
```

The absence of the `--user` parameter or the incorrect definition of the "current user" leads to the app being installed in an unintended user account.
