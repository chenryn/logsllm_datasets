# Summary
Basically, if you have multiple users on an android phone, flutter deploys
sometimes to the wrong user account. Unless you switch accounts, this looks
like the deploy totally failed.
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Setup an Android phone with multiple accounts
  2. Build a flutter app
  3. do a "flutter run"
  4. flutter seems to hang, nothing happens (if actually used user has not logged in yet) or flutter seems to run but no app appears on phone (because it gets installed to an other account)  
When checking the App via "Settings/memory/other apps" it sometimes says "not
available for user".
## Used hardware

## Logs and explanation
    from flutter run --verbose:
    "executing: C:\Users\Oliver\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools\adb -s BJ106805 shell am start -a
    android.intent.action.RUN -f 0x20000000 --ez enable-background-compilation true --ez enable-dart-profiling true
    klages.de.bla/klages.de.bla.MainActivity"
This is missing the --user parameter. From the ADB manual:  
"--user user_id | current: Specify which user to run as; if not specified,
then run as the current user."
"then run as current user " either doesn't work or the definition of current
user is not what i would expect :-)
