I am coming over to this project from webdriverio to evaluate this.
In Selenium and webdriverio we would just call waitForEnabled() or
waitForEnabled({ reverse: true }) but I see only
    waitFor("attached"|"detached"|"visible"|"hidden")
I see that isEnabled has timeout option but that does not work for me to
really know when it will be. Is there a polling or something that we can tap
into and if so how would one go about ?
