Each step recorded has a date and time and is annotated in bright green in the screenshot surrounding what you clicked. Examine your screenshots. In the first frame, your Start button will be highlighted in green with an arrow on it. The explanation at the top of each picture will tell you how the data was entered. When you're troubleshooting, sometimes input makes a difference.
At the bottom of the Recorded Steps page, there will be an Additional Details section. This section contains specific details about software and operating systems that only programmers or advanced IT people will understand. Review this to make sure nothing is in here that you don't want shared.
Have you ever been asked to present in a meeting with 15 minutes prep time? I'm good, but I'm not that good. If you are being asked to present on something that you can show in PSR, scroll up to the top of the page and click the hyperlink “Review the recorded steps as a slide show.”
There are a few caveats to PSR. It will look much more professional if you record on just one monitor. This tool will not record text that you type such as passwords; it will record only function and shortcut keys. It also will not capture streaming video or a full‐screen game. You may get a static picture, but this tool delivers a flat, one‐dimensional file. You are also limited by default to only 25 screenshots. If you need more than 25, you will have to go to the Help menu and adjust the settings. These settings will be temporary and not retained. They go back to the default when you close and reopen the program.
I have had professional IT students tell me this tool alone was worth the price of admission to class.
PathPing
In 2017, Panasonic developed a prototype that not only washes and dries but also folds your clothes. There are some technologies that just belong together.
PathPing is the washer/dryer/folder combination of Windows. If you take a ping and squish it together with a tracert, you have PathPing. Each node is pinged as the result of a single command. Details of the path between two hosts and the echo‐location statistics for each node are displayed. The behavior of nodes is studied over an extended time period—25 seconds each, to be exact. This is in comparison to the default ping sample of four messages or default tracert single‐route trace.
PathPing will first do a tracert to the destination. Second, it uses ICMP to ping each hop 100 times. This is used to verify latency between the source host and the destination. You cannot completely rely on ICMP when public devices are involved. They are public devices. Occasionally on the Internet, you will run into situations where an ICMP ping destined for one host has 50 percent failure and the next hop has 100 percent success.
Figure 2.3 shows the tracing route to Google's public DNS server 8.8.8.8. From my desktop to the server, it takes 11 hops. Then PathPing will compute the statistics of round‐trip time (RTT) as well as the percentage of how many packets were dropped between the two IP addresses. When you see loss rates, it might indicate that these routers are overloaded.
Figure 2.3: PathPing combining both traceroute and statistics of each hop
PathPing is a better diagnostic tool to use if latency in your network is a concern. The interpretation of the data from a PathPing will give you a more robust hypothesis. If you see anomalies or peaks and valleys in the data on hop 6, it doesn't necessarily mean that hop 6 is the problem. It could be that hop 6 just happens to be under immense pressure or the processor has priorities other than your PathPing at the moment. A tool that ISPs use to prevent overwhelming floods of ICMP is called control‐plane policing (CoPP). This type of flood prevention can also alter the results you see from PathPing. In Lab 2.3, you'll use PathPing.
LAB 2.3: PATHPING
Open a command prompt, PowerShell, or a terminal window.
Type the following command to display options that you can use with the PathPing tool:pathping /?
At the next command prompt, type the following:pathping –q 50 8.8.8.8
By using–q 50 as an option, you cut your time in half, although it will still be a very long 137 seconds.
MTR
My TraceRoute (MTR) is another tool that combines multiple tools into one. MTR was originally named for Matt Kimball in 1997 and was called Matt's TraceRoute.
WinMTR is a Windows application that combines the tracert and ping commands. At the time of publication, it can be downloaded from www.winmtr.net. The tool is often used for network troubleshooting. By showing a list of routers traveled and average time and packet loss, it allows administrators to identify issues between two routers responsible for overall latency. This can help identify network overuse problems. In Lab 2.4, you'll use MTR.
LAB 2.4: MTR
Open a command prompt or a terminal window.
Download the WinMTR file from www.winmtr.net, and choose the appropriate file for your hardware (e.g., x86 x64).
Extract the .zip file, making note of the location.
Open the WinMTR folder and double‐click the application. PathPing along with other information will be displayed in a graphical user interface (GUI), making the data much easier to document.
Next to Host, type 8.8.8.8 and click Start. In Figure 2.4, you see the results.

Copy or export your results by clicking either the Export TEXT or Export HTML button.
Double‐click a hostname for more information. Select the down arrow at the end of the host field and clear your history.
Sysinternals
Microsoft TechNet is a treasure‐trove of all things Microsoft, including troubleshooting, downloads, and training. From the website https://technet.microsoft.com, you can find free training, libraries, wikis, forums, and blogs. When your Microsoft workstation fails hard with a BSOD, where do you go to look up the error codes and event IDs? TechNet! Where do you go to find utilities to help you manage, troubleshoot, and diagnose your Windows machines and applications? TechNet!
When you visit the TechNet website, the fastest way to find the Sysinternals suite is to just search for it in the upper‐right corner. The Sysinternals suite bundles many smaller utilities into one big beautiful tool. One of the best things about the Sysinternals suite is that it is portable. Figure 2.5 shows the download link. You do not have to install each tool. You can put the entire suite of tools on a USB drive and use them from any PC.
Figure 2.5: Microsoft Sysinternals suite download
The tools include utilities such as Process Explorer, which is a lot like Task Manager with a ton of extra features, or Autoruns, which helps you deal with startup processes. Another tool inside the suite is PsExec, which is a lightweight replacement for Telnet. One of my favorite tools is Notmyfault. Seriously, that's the name of the tool. You can use it to crash or handle kernel memory leaks—helpful when troubleshooting device driver issues, which has been the cause of at least half of my BSODs. In Lab 2.5, you'll use Sysinternals.
LAB 2.5: SYSINTERNALS
Open a browser and navigate to https://technet.microsoft.com.
In the Search field, look for Sysinternals. The first link you should see is “Download Sysinternals Suite.”The zipped file will be about 24MB. Unzipped, it will be approximately 60MB. It will easily fit on a USB drive.
Save the file to your hard drive and extract all files. Make a conscious note of the location. (I say this because I have been known to misplace my tools.)
Once the tools are unzipped, open the folder and change the view to List, as you see in Figure 2.6. This will allow you to see everything at one time.
Figure 2.6: List of all Sysinternals tools
There are so many wonderful tools in this file that it can be difficult to know where to start. The following list includes the tools that I have used quite regularly as well as some that I may not use as much but have been helpful in certain situations:
Process Explorer    This tool is one of the most used utilities in Sysinternals. It is a simple tool, but it can clue you in on every process, every DLL, and every activity occurring on your PC. In Figure 2.7, you see processes, CPU usage, PID, and other information. One of my favorite features of Process Explorer is the ability to check processes with VirusTotal if you suspect your machine is compromised.
Figure 2.7: Sysinternals Process Explorer
PsList    One way to see processes on a machine is to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete on your keyboard and navigate to your Task Manager. The Task Manager is a great tool but works only on the local machine. You can run PsList remotely to get a list of processes running on someone else's machine.
PsKill    This tool can be used to kill or terminate processes running on either your machine or someone else's machine. Find the process ID with PsList and terminate it with PsKill.
Autoruns    Malware is the bane of our IT existence. It can be insidious and invade the startup folder. It will be one the hardest things you will ever try to clean. Autoruns can help by looking through all possible locations where applications are listed to autostart. You can filter Autoruns so that the good things you need to start are not listed, and you can concentrate on the number of things that invade a system.
ZoomIt    This utility can be used to magnify a certain area of the screen. It can integrate with PowerPoint so that during a presentation you can trigger certain functions with macro keys. You can live zoom, draw, type, and even configure a break timer if your audience requires one during a class.
PsLoggedOn    This tool can find users who are logged on to a system. PsLoggedOn uses a scan of the registry to look through the HKEY_USERS key to see what profiles are loaded. This can be extremely helpful when you need to know who has a session established on a PC.
SDelete    This is a tool that you should not need often but could definitely come in handy. If you ever need to delete something permanently so that even the best of the best file recovery tools cannot retrieve the data, SDelete will take the sectors where the file is stored and write over them with 0s. If you are ever in need of a permanent disposal of a file or folder, you will want to use this tool.
PsExec    There will be times that you will want to execute programs on remote systems. Telnet runs on port 23 and sends credentials over a network in the clear. PsExec is a much better choice, allowing you to execute processes without having to manually install other software. You can launch interactive command prompts and enable remote tools.
Notmyfault    If you have a server that is not performing as it should or you are seeing out‐of‐resources errors and the machine is very slow, you can use Notmyfault to troubleshoot more advanced operating system performance issues and application or process crashes.
The Legendary God Mode
My first experience with invulnerability came in 1993 when I started playing Doom. Doom was a first‐person shooter game that was divided up into nine level episodes. You played a character nicknamed DoomGuy who was a space marine who finds himself in Hell. There was a particular IDBEHOLDV cheat that made you invulnerable. This was considered God mode.
In 2007, with the debut of Windows 7 came a tool that was nicknamed God mode. Its real name is Windows Master Control Panel, although I personally think God mode sounds more epic.
Windows Master Control Panel gives you access to all the operating systems control panels within one folder. You can enable God mode in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 as well. The feature is useful for those in IT, those who manage a computer, and advanced Windows experts. Enabling God mode creates a folder that gives you access to every single Windows OS setting. The icon you see in Figure 2.8 is for the folder that gets created.
Figure 2.8: God mode folder
In Lab 2.6, you'll enable Windows Master Control Panel.
LAB 2.6: ENABLING WINDOWS MASTER CONTROL PANEL
Make sure you are using an account with administrative privileges.
Right‐click your Windows 7, 8.1, or 10 desktop and choose New ➪ Folder.
Name the folder GodMode.{ED7BA470‐8E54‐465E‐825C‐99712043E01C}.
Press Enter and double‐click the Windows Master Control Panel icon to open the file.
It's not quite as exciting as being completely invulnerable in Doom, but as far as being in IT, having all these tools in one spot is pretty awesome. Before you start experimenting with the wide assortment of tools, you may want to consider taking a backup of your machine. As shown in Figure 2.9, when you open the GodMode folder, creating a backup and restore file will be one of the first options you see.

ZenMap
One of my favorite nonprofit organizations is the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The mission of CIS is to “identify, develop, validate, promote, and sustain best‐practice solutions for cyber defense and build and lead communities to enable an environment of trust in cyberspace.” CIS is a collection of subject‐matter experts (SMEs) who are able to work together to identify effective security measures for the good of everyone. CIS has an important role in cybersecurity. One of its many contributions is maintaining the most powerful and current cybersecurity best‐practices documentation called the “CIS Controls Version 7.”
The controls are divided into basic, foundational, and organizational actions so that you can protect your organization and safeguard your data from cyberattacks. Attackers all over the world are scanning public‐facing IP addresses, attempting to find weaknesses in a network.
This chapter will focus on the top CIS‐recommended set of actions that all organizations should take. The first is the inventory and control of hardware assets, and the second is the inventory and control of software on those assets. When you are able to track and manage devices and software on your network, you ultimately prevent unauthorized devices and software. You have increased your security posture.
One of the first things you will do to build a security program is implement inventory control. The tool we will start this process with is Nmap, an open source network mapper. Many system administrators find Nmap to be useful when they need to build their documentation around network inventory and topology. In the background, Nmap manipulates IP packets in several ways, attempting to determine what assets are on the network. It will also attempt to find what services, applications, and operating systems are on those assets.
Nmap was originally built as a command‐line tool you could execute through a shell or terminal window. The goal was to build a flexible and extremely powerful free open source tool. Originally built on Linux for pure‐hearted system administrators, it evolved and is available for Windows as well as in a graphical user interface (GUI) format, Zenmap. There are more than 100 command‐line options in Nmap, and some of these were never fully documented by the author, Gordon Lyon.
In any size network but especially large, dynamic networks, it is vitally important to break down these complex networks and analyze traffic, facilitate issues, and fix connection problems. Network scanning is a process of finding assets that are alive or have a heartbeat, communicating and then gathering as much vital information about those assets as possible. Network scanning can be divided into four stages:
Network mapping
Open ports
Services running
Operating systems
Network Mapping
Network mapping uses a process to discover and visualize assets by actively probing them. Nmap sends both TCP and UDP packets to a targeted machine. These are called probe packets. A probe packet is a packet used in an active tool to collect information on a network segment of interest. Data is collected after sending those probe packets that hop from node to node and asset to asset, which returns that information to Nmap.
If you were to scan 65,536 ports on every single machine in your ecosystem, this scan could take an astronomically long time and is really unnecessary. Occasionally, you may hear someone refer to a host discovery scan as a ping scan. In Nmap, you could choose to skip the ping itself and use other targeted methods to find the active hosts on your network.
Network environments are all different; therefore, host discovery needs are going to be very different. The hosts on your network serve multiple purposes, and from a priority standpoint, not all assets are created equal. Some assets are mission critical, while some are used only occasionally and are not as important.
By default, Nmap starts its process by launching host discovery. By default, Nmap will send an ICMP echo request, ICMP timestamp request, and a TCP packet to port 80 (HTTP) and a TCP packet to port 443 (HTTPS). There are several options you can add to a basic Nmap scan to tailor it to your environment. You will definitely want to be using administrator credentials to execute these commands to achieve the best results. For example, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is enabled when scanning networks when you are using administrator credentials. ARP is a protocol for mapping an IP address to a physical address on a host called a Media Access Control (MAC) address. The table that gets created during an ARP request is called the ARP cache and matches a host's network address with its physical address.
To launch a scan on a network segment, use the following command:
>nmap -sn 
The results will include all active hosts that respond to the probes sent by Nmap. The option ‐sn disables port scanning while leaving the discovery phase untouched. Figure 3.1 shows how Nmap does a ping sweep of assets, meaning you will see only the available hosts that responded to the probes sent out. Most system administrators find this option to be extremely useful and quick to verify which assets are active on the network.
Figure 3.1:  nmap  command
It is important to scan periodically for new assets that have been added to your network without notification. Change management procedures are not followed or, in a new business, not even written. New machines can be added to networks without being scanned for vulnerabilities.
I had a situation once where the system administrator would scan systems for vulnerabilities in the evenings and on weekends to avoid production hours. Over the weekend, he would see a server pop up in his scans. When this admin would come back in on Monday, he couldn't ping this server. It had disappeared. This happened for a couple weeks until he finally found the problem. One of the networking support people who were supposed to be working over the weekend had a gaming server under his desk. They were having LAN wars instead of patching systems. When they were done “working,” the server was unplugged from the network.
Port Scanning
A port scan is a way to figure out which ports on a network are open and which are listening and possibly show whether there are any security devices such as firewalls between the sender and receiver. This process is called fingerprinting.
Ports are numbered from 0 to 65,535, but the lower range of 0 to 1,023 consists of the “well‐known” ones. A port scan will carefully craft a packet to each destination port. There are some basic techniques to choose from, depending on the network topology and scanning goals.
Vanilla scan: This is the most basic scan, fully connecting to 65,536 ports. It's accurate but easily detectable.
SYN scan: This scan sends a SYN but does not wait for a response. It's faster, but you still learn if the port is open.
Strobe scan: This selectively attempts to connect to only a few ports, typically fewer than 20.
There are some other techniques that penetration testers use, such as Stealth, FTP Bounce, and XMAS, which are scans that were developed so the sender could scan undetected. The sender's location can be obfuscated so that an attacker can get the information while not being tracked.
Now that you know a machine is alive on the network, it's time to determine which ports are open on that host. From a security viewpoint, it is vital to the health and well‐being of your network to know exactly which of the 65,536 ports might be exposed. There are six port states that are currently recognized by Nmap.
Open: An application is actively listening for a connection.
Closed: A probe has been received, but no application is listening.
Filtered: It's unknown if port is open; packet filtering typically from a firewall has prevented a probe from reaching the port. Sometimes you get an error response, and sometimes filters will just drop the probe.
Unfiltered: A port is accessible, but Nmap hasn't a clue if the port is open or closed.
Open/filtered: The port is filtered or open, but no state is established.
Closed/filtered: Nmap is unable to determine whether the port is closed or filtered.
The most popular port scan to use by default is the ‐sS, or SYN, scan you see in Figure 3.2. It is a fast scan, scanning thousands of ports per second relatively stealthily since it's not waiting around for an acknowledgment.
Figure 3.2: Nmap SYN scan
To launch a port scan on a network segment, use the following command:
>nmap -sS 
Services Running
Many moons ago, I taught the CompTIA classes for Iron Horse University at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs. My soldiers would sit in my classroom for two weeks of instruction and hands‐on learning. So, if someone wanted to talk to one of my soldiers, they would come down the hall and into classroom 4. They needed a specific person, so they would go to that person's seat so they could talk to him or her.
As an example, let's say the soldier's name was Carla, who was seated in seat 23. So, Carla's socket was classroom.4:23. A socket is a point of ingress or egress. The combination of an IP address and a port is called an endpoint. A socket is one of the endpoints in a two‐way conversation between two programs communicating over a network. A socket is bound to a port number so we know which application that data is destined for.
The person sitting in seat 23 is like the program that is registered with the operating system to listen at that port. What if Carla was absent? What if someone else was sitting in seat 23? Programs listening on a certain port may or may not be the usual listener. You need to know whether Carla and Robert swapped seats. Table 3.1 describes the most common ports and the services that should be running on them.
