Right now all constraint configuration should be defined in the
`validator.xml` or `validator.yaml` file. Once you have a lot of entities this
file becomes overly large. As I'm completely unfamiliar with the way metadata
is handled by the validation component I need some suggestions before I can
open a PR.
This might be related to #2992 and #2996 but I'm not sure.
