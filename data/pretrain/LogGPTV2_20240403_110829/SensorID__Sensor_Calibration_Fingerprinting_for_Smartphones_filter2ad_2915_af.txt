A. Nominal gain estimation
APPENDIX
Figure 6 shows the estimated gyroscope nominal gain from
two iPhone X devices. Both devices were at rest on a desk
during the data collection. To show the results more clearly,
The ﬁgure only presents a small range of data. As shown
in the ﬁgure, the difference between the estimated gyroscope
nominal gain from these two devices is tiny. Therefore, we can
use the estimated nominal gain from one device to estimate
the gain matrix of another device. It is also clear from the
ﬁgure that the degree of ﬂuctuations around the nominal gain
is different for these two devices, which indicates that their
gain matrix is different and may be used as a ﬁngerprint.
B. Gain Matrix Estimations of an iPhone 5
The estimations of the gyroscope gain matrix of an iPhone
5 is shown in Fig. 7. Here, values in each column are corre-
sponding to the nine gain matrix values estimated from one
batch of data (ﬁve batches in total), subtracting the nominal
gain (unit: 2−16
dps).
C. Screenshots of the GYROID Proof of Concept App
Screenshots of the GYROID proof of concept app is shown
in Fig. 8.
D. Distribution of the GYROID
Results are presented in Fig. 9, 10, and 11.
