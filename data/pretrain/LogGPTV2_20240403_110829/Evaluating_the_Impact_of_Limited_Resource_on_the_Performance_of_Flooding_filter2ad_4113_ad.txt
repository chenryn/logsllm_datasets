However,
there are also some differences between the
results, for example in the 95% conﬁdence intervals for
timing (in milliseconds in Ganesan et al. and cycles for the
simulator). For medium transmission power, considering 95%
of the network nodes, the error observed in experiments [8]
is 18% for reception time and 4% for settling from 7
runs with a 156 node network. For the same results in
simulation the error is 55% for reception time and 5% for
settling from 100 runs with a 169 node network. The small
network is particularly unstable, with signiﬁcant performance
differences depending on the order in which nodes transmit,
which may account for the larger errors measured in 100
simulation runs. The performance of larger networks is more
stable.
Our simulations use an average footprint for each power
setting, derived from Woo’s experimental data for 110 of
the nodes used in the ﬂooding experiments [15], [8]. Inter-
estingly, for the same power setting, the footprint size of
individual motes as observed in experiments [15] can vary
dramatically. For example, averaging over the 110 motes
whose footprints were measured at medium power, the aver-
age number of footprint cells containing good signal is 113.
The number of good cells in a full footprint was inferred from
the experimental data when the full footprint was not directly
measurable because it would fall outside the experiment’s
landscape. At medium power, the worst performing node’s
footprint contains an average of 47 good cells. The best
performing node’s footprint contains an average of 297 good
cells. Obviously, using the average footprint for all nodes can
be misleading. One solution is to build standard deviations
into the footprint calculation algorithm [10]. However, since
the difference between footprints seems to be associated with
particular mote hardware and position, rather than simply
noisiness in each mote’s performance, that solution does not
adequately capture the diversity of node performance. Further
work is needed to resolve this issue. Node diversity may turn
out to be much less signiﬁcant for the more reliable radio
hardware in current generation Mica 2 motes [20], [17].
VI. RELATED WORK
Our simulation experiments were motivated by a recent
empirical study of the performance of ﬂooding protocols in
wireless sensor networks [8], [15]. This study used a sensor
network consisting of 156 Berkeley motes [20] placed in
a regular grid pattern in a 26 foot by 26 foot landscape.
Each node in the network, in turn, transmitted 20 packets
at different transmit power settings. The number of these
packets received by each surrounding node is recorded [15].
In a second experiment, a ﬂood is initiated from a node in
the middle of the base of this grid, and each node recorded
its transmission and reception of messages during the ﬂood.
Using raw data from the footprint experiment [15], we can
estimate the probability of reception given distance and
direction from the source. We used these probabilities in our
simulation experiments to deﬁne transmission footprints. We
also used the same network topology, transmission powers,
and ﬂooding protocol as the empirical study.

As well as empirical results, there are several analytical
studies of ﬂooding algorithms relevant to our investigation.
A study of the broadcast storm problem for ad hoc networks,
of which sensor networks are an example, is presented by Ni
et al together with several variations on the basic ﬂooding
protocol [21]. Geometric analysis is used to investigate
broadcast redundancy, contention and collisions, and simu-
lation to analyse the performance of ﬂooding in a network
of mobile nodes with different node densities. A study by
Sasson et al [22] investigates probabilistic ﬂooding, looking
for phase transitions, again using an ideal circular broadcast
footprint. A simulation model for wireless sensor networks
which incorporates a noisy footprint model is presented in [6]
and used to analyse the performance of protocols such as
ﬂooding in wireless sensor networks. The simulator searches
for conﬁgurations which optimise certain properties, such as
maximising reliability whilst minimising consumed power.
Analytical methods based on differential equations have been
used to create epidemiological models for the spread of
disease and such models can also be used to analyse ﬂooding
algorithms [23]. As in the broadcast storm study, a circular
transmission footprint is assumed and different densities of
network nodes are considered. In addition, nodes are mobile,
and follow a random movement model. The epidemic model
describes the infection of all nodes, which is comparable
to time efﬁciency in this paper. However, it does not allow
the protocol followed by the nodes to be changed, different
transmission footprints to be used, nor does it allow the
measurement of settling time.
Woo, Tong and Culler [10] investigate the performance of
routing protocols, including ﬂooding, using a Matlab simula-
tor which takes into account footprint noise in a similar way
to our model, and also using a 50 node experimental network.
However, they compare the performance of different routing
protocols in the same WSN setting, whereas we examine the
effects on performance of underlying characteristics such as
landscape size, transmission power and MAC layer constants.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
Our simulation experiments support the following observa-
tions on the impact of limited resources on the performance
of ﬂooding in a wireless sensor network:
• Low power transmissions have the best time and re-
source efﬁciency for the dense network topology we
simulated. They are also the most energy efﬁcient for
the network as a whole and for each individual node.
• The ﬂooding algorithm has excellent scaling properties
for large networks. Most activity occurs in parallel, and
the only bottle-necks are local effects where network
nodes in the same transmission neighbourhood must
wait for others to transmit before they can obtain the
broadcast medium. The performance of large networks
is more stable than that of small networks. For example,
the number of cycles for 95% reception time has errors
of 5% to 9% for large networks as opposed to 55% for
a small network.
• The performance of ﬂooding algorithms is readily
tunable, even given a ﬁxed node topology, because
variables such as transmission power and MAC layer
backoff are all accessible to the developer. We have
shown that the adjustment of maximum backoff, for
example, can be used to improve protocol performance.
in dense
networks for all conﬁgurations tested. This is despite the
noisiness of low power radio footprints, and the high
probability of collisions between competing transmis-
sions from overlapping footprints.
• The ﬂooding protocol
is over 99% robust
• The resource limitation of noisy footprints vs idealised
dense footprints in wireless sensor networks has a
signiﬁcant impact on performance. At very low trans-
mission power, noisy footprints actually improve the
performance of ﬂooding, whilst at all other transmis-
sion powers,
this resource limitation leads to worse
performance that with idealised footprints. This result
demonstrates that simulation experiments for investigat-
ing performance should take into account the observed
transmission footprints of motes and not rely on ide-
alised transmission models.
We have presented an object oriented simulation frame-
work, Boris, and described its instantiation as a wireless
sensor network simulator.
Our study has highlighted several areas for further work.
There is clearly a need for more empirical data from sensor
network applications in order to develop accurate models of
different aspects of network performance, and so to establish
a systematic basis for protocol design and deployment.
We also plan to add classes to the simulator to model
the energy available to each sensor node, to model envi-
ronmental factors such as the behaviour of the environment
being sensed, and to investigate higher level protocols (than
ﬂooding) such as energy aware routing protocols.
