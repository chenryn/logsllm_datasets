Subject: Issue with Using React Components in React Native

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I may be asking a basic question, but I encountered significant issues when trying to use certain React components in a React Native project. Since both are based on React, I was surprised to find that they were not compatible.

Could you provide some insight into why these components might not work in React Native? I am a bit disappointed by this and would appreciate any guidance or suggestions you might have.

Thank you,
Rares
