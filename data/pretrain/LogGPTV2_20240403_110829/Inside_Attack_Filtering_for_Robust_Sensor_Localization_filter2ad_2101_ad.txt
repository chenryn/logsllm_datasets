ation: When HiRLoc uses the communication range varia-
tion option, an adversary launching a Sybil attack can also
impersonate locators Li ∈ LHs when their communication
range is reduced so that they are no longer heard to the
sensor. For example in ﬁgure 5(a), when locator L4 reduces
its communication range and is no longer heard by s, it can
be impersonated in a similar way as locators L5 ∼ L9.
In such a case, limiting the number of locators heard to
a maximum allowable number does not guarantee that the
valid beacons will be more than the fabricated ones. In order
to avoid sensor displacement we follow the same approach
as in the case of the wormhole attack in the communication
range variation option. The sensor computes an estimate of
the ROI by using only the beacons with the maximum
communication range and by limiting the number of locators
heard. Once the initial estimate of the ROI is computed, any
subsequent estimation ROI(j) has to intersect with the initial
one. Otherwise the sensor detects that is under attack and
rejects that estimate. Hence, an adversary can only hope to
displace the sensor within the region of the initial estimation
ROI(1).
D. Compromised network entities
compromise of a single locator can potentially lead to the
displacement of any sensor in the network [18].
An adversary compromising a locator gains access to both
the globally shared key K0, the master key KLi used for the
construction of all the pairwise keys, as well as the locator’s
hash chain. During the execution of ACLA, a compromised
locator can displace a sensor if it transmits from a location
that is closer to the sensor than the closest valid locator. To
avoid sensor displacement by a single locator compromise, we
strengthen the robustness of the ACLA algorithm by adopting
the Enhanced Location Resolution Algorithm (ELRA) initially
proposed in [19], in order to resolve any location ambiguity.
The advantage of ELRA is that it involves replies from more
than one locators, so that a single locator compromise is
not sufﬁcient to displace a sensor. A sensor s under attack
executes the following steps to determine its location.
- Step 1: Sensor s broadcasts a nonce ηs, the set of locators
heard LHs(1) in the ﬁrst transmission round and its IDs.
s : { ηs (cid:107) LHs(1) (cid:107) IDs }.
(15)
- Step 2: Every locator Li
receiving ηs appends its
coordinates, the next hash value of its hash chain and its
IDLi, encrypts the message with K0 and re-broadcasts the
message to all sectors with maximum power.
- Step 3: Every locator receiving the re-broadcast, veriﬁes
the authenticity of the message, and that
the transmitting
locator is within range. If the veriﬁcation is correct and the
receiving locator belongs to LHs(1), the locator broadcasts
a new beacon with location information and the nonce ηs
encrypted with the pairwise key with sensor s.
Li : { ηs (cid:107) loci (cid:107) H n−k(P Wi) (cid:107) j (cid:107) IDLi }KLi
- Step 4: The sensor collects the ﬁrst Lmax authentic
replies from locators, and selects those Lmax locators as the
valid set. The sensor executes HiRLoc with only the valid set
of locators.

Network entities are assumed to be compromised when
the attacker gains full control over their behavior. While an
attacker has no incentive to compromise sensors, since sen-
sors do not actively participate in the localization procedure,
The pseudo-code for the ELRA is shown in ﬁgure 6. Each
beacon broadcast from a locator has to include the nonce ηs
initially broadcasted by the sensor and be encrypted with the
pairwise key between the sensor and the locator. Hence, given

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section we compare the performance of HiRLoc
with state-of-the-art decentralized range-independent
local-
ization techniques [3], [10], [18], [25], [26]. We show the
improvements achieved when HiRLoc is employing the an-
tenna orientation variation and when HiRLoc is employing the
communication range variation method. For our performance
evaluation, we randomly distributed 5,000 sensors within a
100x100 m2 square area and also randomly placed locators
within the same area, and for each sensor we computed the
ROI for different locator densities ρL. We repeated each
experiment for 100 networks and averaged the results.
Using the locator density ρL we can compute the average
number of locators heard by each sensor, as well as the number
of locators that need to be deployed in order to cover a speciﬁc
region with density ρL. The average locators heard by each
sensor is computed based on (1), and is equal to:
|L|
A πR2,
(17)
where |L| denotes the total number of locators deployed and
A denotes the size of the deployment region.
LH = ρLπR2 =
For example, if we want each sensor to hear on average 10
locators and the communication range of each locator is equal
to R = 40m, we need to deploy locators with a density
ρL = LH
πR2 = 0.008 locators/m2.
Given the locator density, the total number of locators than
need to be deployed to cover a A = 100x100 m2 square
area is equal to ρLA = 0.008x104 = 80 locators. Deploying
80 locators is sufﬁcient for each sensor to hear on average
10 locators, independent of the number of sensors deployed

within the sensor ﬁeld. Once the deployment area has been
sufﬁciently covered with locators, an arbitrary number of
sensors can be supported within that area.
A. Localization error vs. Locators heard and Communication
overhead
In our ﬁrst experiment, we examined the impact of the
average number of locators heard LH on the localization
accuracy of HiRLoc and compared it with the state-of-the-art
range-independent localization algorithms. We evaluated the
average localization error LE as:
LE =
r
i=1
(18)
where S denotes the set of sensors deployed within A, ˆsi
denotes the location estimate for sensor si and si denotes the
real position of the sensor. For HiRLoc, the location estimate
ˆsi of each sensor was computed as the center of gravity of
the ROI. In order to provide a fair comparison with methods
that do not use directional antennas, we normalized LH for
HiRLoc by multiplying LH with the number of antenna
sectors used at each locator.
In ﬁgure 7(a) we show the average localization error LE
in units of sensor communication range r for varying number
of locators heard at each sensor. HiRLoc-AV denotes HiRLoc
that uses antenna orientation variation to improve upon the
accuracy of the location estimate of sensors. HiRLoc-RV
denotes HiRLoc that uses communication range variation to
improve upon the accuracy of the location estimate of sensors.
For HiRLoc-AV and HiRLoc-RV, we performed only one
rotation of the antenna at each locator and only one reduction
in the communication range, respectively and used 3-sectored
antennas.
We can observe that HiRLoc-AV has the best performance
among all algorithms while HiRLoc-RV gives the second best
performance. The localization error drops rapidly under r even
for small values of LH while it is equal to LE = 0.23r for

(b)
LH = 15.6 HiRLoc-AV is superior than HiRLoc-RV for the
same value of LH, since in HiRLoc-AV locators still transmit
with the same transmission power once their antenna has been
rotated. Hence, the same set of locators is heard at each sensor
in any transmission round. On the other hand, in HiRLoc-RV,
once the transmission range has been reduced some of the
locators heard in the previous round may get out of the range
of the sensor and, hence, the improvement in the accuracy of
the location estimation using HiRLoc-RV is less than the one
achieved with HiRLoc-AV.
We observe that for small
In ﬁgure 7(b) we show the communication cost required for
localization in number of transmitted messages, for varying
average localization error LE. The communication cost was
computed for a sensor network of 200 sensors. Note that
SeRLoc and HiRLoc are the only algorithms whose communi-
cation cost is independent of the number of sensors deployed.
All other algorithms rely on neighbor sensor information to
estimate the sensor location and, hence, the communication
cost grows with the increase of the size of the sensor network.
localization error (less than
r) HiRLoc requires less messages for localization compared
to all other algorithms. This result seems counter intuitive,
since each locators in our experiment had to transmit twice
the number of messages compared to SeRLoc. However,
fewer locators were required in order to achieve the desired
localization accuracy, and, hence, the overall communication
cost was lower for HiRLoc. As the required localization
accuracy decreases (above r) SeRLoc becomes more efﬁcient
than HiRLoc, since it can achieve good precision with a
relatively small number of locators. It is important to note
that though HiRLoc and SeRLoc have similar performance
in communication overhead, HiRLoc needs a much smaller
number of locators to achieve the same localization accuracy.
This fact becomes evident in the following experiments.
B. Region of intersection—Antenna orientation variation
In our second experiment, we examined the impact of the
number of antenna rotations on the size of the ROI. In
6LH = 15 corresponds to each sensor hearing on average 5 locators since
locators were equipped with 3-sectored antennas.
ﬁgure 8(a) we show the ROI vs. the number of antenna
rotations, and for varying LH, when 3-sector antennas are
used at each locator. Note that the ROI is normalized over
the size of the ROI given by SeRLoc denoted by ROI(1)
(no antenna rotation). From ﬁgure 8(a), we observe that even
a single antenna rotation, reduces the size of the ROI by
more than 50%, while three antenna rotations reduce the size
to ROI(4) = 0.12ROI(1), when LH = 5. A reduction of
50% in the size of the ROI by a single antenna rotation
means that one can deploy half the locators compared to
SeRLoc and achieve the same localization accuracy by just
rotating the antenna system at each locator once. The savings
in number of locators are signiﬁcant considering that
the
reduction in hardware requirements comes at no additional
cost in communication overhead.
We also observe that as LH grows HiRLoc does not reduce
the ROI by the same percentage compared to lower LH =
5. This is due to the fact that when the number of locators
heard at each sensor is high, SeRLoc provides an already good
estimate of the sensor location (small ROI) and hence, the
margin for reduction of the ROI size is limited.
In ﬁgure 8(b) we show the normalized ROI vs. the number
of antenna rotations, and for varying number of antenna sectors
at each locator. As in the case of high LH, when the antenna
sectors become narrow (16-sector antennas) SeRLoc already
gives a very good location estimate and hence, HiRLoc does
not provide the same improvement as in the case of wider
sectors. Furthermore, when the sectors are already very narrow,
it would be expensive to develop a mechanism that would
rotate the antennas at each locator with great precision. Hence,
HiRLoc is very efﬁcient when wide antenna sectors are used
at each locator.
C. Region of Intersection—Communication Range variation
In our third experiment, we examined the impact of the
communication range variation on the size of the (ROI). In
ﬁgure 9(a) we show the normalized ROI vs. the number of
communication range variations, and for different LH values,
when 3-sector antennas are used at each locator. Each locator
transmits beacons at four different communication ranges.

(b)
From ﬁgure 9(a), we observe that the communication range
variation, though signiﬁcantly improves the system perfor-
mance, does not achieve the same ROI reduction as the
antenna orientation variation7. This behavior is explained by
the fact that the gradual reduction of the communication range
reduces the number of beacons heard at each sensor, in contrast
with the antenna orientation variation case where the same
number of locators is heard at the sensors at each antenna
rotation. In addition, we observe that greater ROI reduction
occurs when the LH at each locator is high. This is justiﬁed
by considering that a higher LH allows for more sectors with
lower communication range to intersect and hence, smaller
ROI.
In ﬁgure 9(b), we show the normalized ROI vs.
the
number of communication range variations, and for varying
number of antenna sectors at each locator. Though the ROI
reduction is not as high as in the antenna orientation variation
case, the communication range variation leads to signiﬁcant
performance improvement. As in our previous experiment,
narrower antenna beams give a good location estimate and
hence, has smaller margin for improvement.
VI. RELATED WORK
While the problem of localization in a trusted environment
has been an extensive topic of research [1], [3], [10], [25]–
[27], [30], [31], very few methods have been proposed for
secure localization [6], [15], [18]–[22].
Localization schemes proposed for a trusted environment
can be classiﬁed to range-dependent and range-independent
based schemes. In range-dependent schemes, nodes determine
their location based on distance or angle estimates to some
reference points with known coordinates. Such estimates may
be acquired through different methods such as time of arrival
(TOA) [5], [11],
time difference of arrival (TDOA) [30],
[31], angle of arrival (AOA) [27], or received signal strength
indicator (RSSI) [1]. In the range-independent localization
schemes, nodes determine their location based only on the
