## Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior
The application should function without any errors.

### Current Behavior
- Clicking on `Dynamic1` or `Dynamic2` briefly displays an error before the correct page is shown.
- Clicking on `Level1 home page` or `Level1 about` page results in a "Not Found" error.
- Clicking on `WithHash` triggers an unexpected error message: "An unexpected error has occurred."

### Steps to Reproduce
To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `test/integration/static` project to a temporary directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r test/integration/static /tmp/next-client
   ```
2. Navigate to the copied directory:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/next-client
   ```
3. Initialize a new Yarn project:
   ```bash
   yarn init -y
   ```
4. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn add next react react-dom
   ```
5. Build and export the Next.js project, then serve the output:
   ```bash
   next build && next export && serve out
   ```
6. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and click on the links described in the "Current Behavior" section.
