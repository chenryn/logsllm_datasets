The current implementation of LocalSessionFactoryBean resets the config time
data source before leaving afterPropertiesSet. However, other frameworks that
use Hibernate namely jbpm will not find a datasource when trying to create the
schema as they will unfortunately reinstantiates a ConnectionProvider which
will reuse the datasource which will return null. The issue is similar with
(http://opensource2.atlassian.com/projects/spring/browse/SPR-1547) but the
Spring-provided DataSource will be request during the HB sessionFactory life-
time (between afterPropertiesSet and destroy).  
The javadoc mention that :
  * This instance will be set before initialization of the corresponding
  * SessionFactory, and reset immediately afterwards. It is thus only available
  * during configuration.  
What's the reason for that?
