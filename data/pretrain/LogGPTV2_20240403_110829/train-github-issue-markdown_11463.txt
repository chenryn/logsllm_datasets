There seems to have been an API change between React 0.12 and 0.13 that's not
covered in the documentation. When using `JSXTransformer.transform` with the
`sourceMap` option, the source map is now returned as a plain JavaScript
object. Previously it would return an instance of `SourceMapGenerator` and
you'd need to call `.toJSON()` to get the actual source map.
Is this an intentional change that just got overlooked when writing the
documentation?
