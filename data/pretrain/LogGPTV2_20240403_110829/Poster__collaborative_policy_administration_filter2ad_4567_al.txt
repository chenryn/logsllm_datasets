context, implies working with the hopes and fears 
of real people. This inevitably implies the need for 
responsible behavior from those involved. Architects 
and builders are responsible for their constructions 
many decades after they have been finished. Medical 
students train on real patients, yet those patients are 
adequately cared for, no matter how well or badly 
the students perform. Even though these analogies 
are only partially relevant to this context, and even 
though the ethical and moral dimensions to this point 
lie beyond the scope of this article, the issue of roles 
and responsibilities of the designer can benefit from 
further debate.
2.3 DESIGNING OUT THE DESIGNER
“New solutions win by virtue of adoption, and they 
don’t get adopted if they’re bad solutions.” 
—John Perry Barlow
One way to ensure or facilitate local stakeholders 
to carry out solutions or carry on the process of 
collaborative solution-building, is to consciously 
“design out the designer” from the solution. Many 
successful initiatives of design for social innovation 
8  During the year following Reciprocity, students of both the MAD 
Faculty (Genk) and ID-campus (HEC, Liège) continued to work on the 
concepts developed in order to guide a group of inhabitants - who 
gathered as a newborn neighborhood movement, as caretakers of 
the initiative’s legacy - in implementing their own solutions, co-
creating toolkits and setting up platforms (on- and offline).
42
have done this by developing so called “toolkits”, 
designed with  the solution’s end-users in mind. Yet all 
too often, these toolkits pay too little attention to the 
broader context in which the solution will need to be 
applied. Generally, people in various roles and positions 
are required in order to make solutions work. When 
phasing out the role of the designer, these need to be 
taken into account. This goes beyond the mere tools 
and extends to people and organizational contexts.
In the case of Saint-Gilles, for example, people clearly 
feel the need for the installment of a skilled person 
and place equipped to catalyze the flow of resourceful 
interaction within the local community.9
For project results to be sustainable solutions, usable 
by the community they were intended to support, it is a 
valuable exercise and learning experience for students 
to learn to ‘undesign’ their role as designers/facilitators 
from the eventual solution they create. As such they 
need to learn to ‘read’ their users, to empathize with 
their audiences and assess their ability to carry out 
or carry on solutions so they can scale. To do this 
they need to be resourceful. In the case of “Welcome 
to Saint-Gilles”, this has been part of the assignment 
for the MAD Faculty students from the beginning.  As 
such, the handing-over phase and growth path of the 
solution was treated as a design challenge in its own 
right.
At the same time, this exercise emphasized the areas 
and moments in which specific design skills were 
needed and the designer could not take a step back, 
but was explicitly needed, such as when translating 
requirements into a specific design.
2.4 Rendering envisionings tangible
“Nothing ever becomes real until it is experienced.”
—John Keats
Involving a broad range of stakeholders implies having 
to deal with a diversity of perspectives and hence 
also of languages through which they address the 
challenges at hand. In order for them to understand 
each other and for designers to be able to integrate 
the information they gather, a common ground needs 
to be established. While words are valuable carriers 
of meaning, their meanings and interpretation by 
people from different backgrounds may vary widely. In 
this context, visuals and tangible objects may help to 
ground meaning.
Besides because of their knowledge of the design 
process itself, designers are well-equipped as 
facilitators of communication10, translators of 
viewpoints and skillful creators of common ground. 
Through drawings, manipulated images, object 
prototypes, storyboards, videosketches and various 
other ways of prototyping ideas, they can render 
observations, ideas and envisioned experiences 
tangible11. As such, these creations can help to establish 
a common ground of understanding and a valuable 
resource of reference material and ‘project memory’.
These materials also allow the designers themselves 
to focus people’s attention more easily and gather 
feedback from the various stakeholders involved as 
to fine-tune their ideas and solutions on a continuous 
basis. Having tangible documentation of designs and 
the design process from the earliest field research, 
over analysis to concept design and implementation, 
all the way to testing and communication of results, 
helps to steer the process and foster engagement. 
As such, the collective materials of stepwise 
inspiration and concretization are powerful ingredients 
in building and maintaining momentum throughout 
the design process. That is also why keeping these - 
often highly visual - materials in view and within arm’s 
reach inside the working space (also while engaging 
with stakeholders) is a stimulating way to remain in 
touch with gathered insights as well as to enable 
people to point at them while discussing them. This 
saves valuable time and helps to keep interpretations 
aligned throughout the process. In the case of 
“Welcome to Saint-Gilles”, no fixed ‘project rooms’ or 
places to meet and engage with stakeholders within 
the neighborhood were available on a continuous 
basis. No working space could therefore evolve 
and this evolution could not grow along with the 
understanding of and discussions between the various 
stakeholders and the designers. A local ‘base-station’ 
would also have been an opportunity to further 
ground the activities within the local area and 
community and allow design students to experience 
9 
 The students and the newly founded neighborhood team/
movement (‘le mouvement Saint-Gilles’) of local inhabitants are 
currently working on both aspects.

neighborhood in a more profound manner.12
their day to day context and look at it from a different 
angle.
In the case of “Welcome to Saint-Gilles”, for practical 
reasons of distance and availability of people, few 
iterations of community-feedback were possible. 
The know-how of teachers and experts involved 
was employed in order to compensate for this lack 
somehow. Nevertheless, students were stimulated to 
render their ideas tangible early on in and throughout 
the project. They did so through maps, diagrams, 
drawings and sketches, but also image manipulations 
as to place envisioned solutions in their intended 
context. Externalizing ideas helped students’ to clarify 
their own ideas by allowing them to enter into a 
dialogue with them as well as to engage in a more 
fruitful discussion with the various stakeholders. From 
street furniture and signage as service touchpoints, 
to tools for community “placemaking” were rendered 
tangible and refined based upon feedback by peers, 
experts, local inhabitants and other stakeholders.
The value of rendering concepts tangible extends 
beyond the prototyping of the ideas as such.
The prototyping activity13 collaborative thought-
experiment with stakeholders of trying to envision 
the possible impacts - both positive and negative - of 
their solution on its context, whether physical or in 
terms of community dynamics. This “what if” game of 
imagineering is often employed within (design driven) 
strategic foresight as to feed discussion and foster 
engagement regarding future challenges, solutions 
and situations.14
2.5 Seeing with new eyes
“The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking 
new landscapes but in having new eyes.”
—Marcel Proust
By engaging with stakeholders and trying to elicit 
information about the context at hand, not only 
does the designer gain valuable insights, but also 
the stakeholders involved are teased to reflect upon 
12  During the evaluation of the project and exploration of ways to 
elaborate upon its results, the need for a “base-station” as a lever 
for social innovation was emphasized.
13  Due to practical restrictions no participatory prototyping took 
place within the “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” project. Students’ 
prototypes were however shown to and discussed with local 
inhabitants (and other stakeholders) as to enable fine tuning 
through feedback.
14  (Baerten, 2012)
Challenged by questions of the designer asking “why 
is that so?”, “why could it not ... ?”, “ but I also see ...”, “what 
if ...”, they are led to question certain assumptions. The 
act of questioning one’s assumptions is a powerful 
source of insight and creative inspiration, but in a way 
it is also a contradiction in terms. It is exactly because 
they are assumptions, that we are mostly not aware of 
them in the first place. It often takes an outsider - in 
this case the designer - to raise the questions that 
allow this to happen.
More than once in the “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” 
project, the expectations of local inhabitants were 
challenged as they witnessed or participated in street

interventions by the students within the framework of 
their design research activities or discussed with them. 
The outsiders’ perspectives made the insiders see with 
new eyes.
It is not just the eye enabling one to look at a context, 
but also the context enabling the eye to see things in 
a different way. There are various ways to bring about 
such effects. Rather than focus on how to achieve a 
certain goal, the authors explicitly challenged students 
to imagine their goal would have been achieved at 
some point in the future, their solution would have 
been realized: “How would the situation look different?”, 
44
“Which steps could have led to this effect?”, ... By luring 
stakeholders away from the present into a preferable 
future, they were stimulated not only to envision 
today’s problems solved, but also today’s points of 
strength developed further.
As such, an important enabler in seeing with new eyes, 
has been to shift students and inhabitants away from 
“what is” and “what has been”, towards “what could be”. 
Of course, among the elderly inhabitants sometimes 
this would mean nostalgia for bygone times would set 
in, but then they were stimulated to combine insights 
from the past with today’s and tomorrow’s challenges 
to come to new envisionings. 
Furthermore, by nudging people away from focussing 
solely on problems to building further on qualities 
already present within the situation at hand, the 
discourse was allowed to take a more opportunistic 
turn. Rather than to emphasize barriers already 
blocking the field of vision, room was created for 
inhabitants and students alike to see new possibilities, 
which could be reached by building on what was 
already present, albeit sometimes in a dormant state. 
As these envisionings of “what could be” were 
rendered tangible, by asking questions such as: 
“Suppose this idea would be in place, how would 
Saint-Gilles look/feel/work differently?”, stakeholders 
started to see even present-day Saint-Gilles through 
different eyes.  Moreover, by providing a temporary 
escape from feasibility checks and impossibilities 
which normally characterize the formality by which 
local initiatives come about, new eyes opened up 
new pathways of enthusiasm and mutual respect in 
relationships between local inhabitants, civil servants 
and policymakers.
In retrospect, one could say that “Welcome to Saint-
Gilles” had the luxury of being supported by local 
policymakers, while they also let it take its own 
course. They framed the project from beginning to 
end, followed its progress and checked in every now 
and then, but mostly kept their distance. As such 
they showed to value and respect the experimental 
nature of the initiative. They allowed themselves to 
be surprised, inspired and in the end to be provided 
with seeds of bottom-up innovation which are now 
available to be co-developed in the future.
Last but not least, schools and students - in the 
45
particular case of Saint-Gilles previously often 
considered a nuisance15 - were now the ones who 
prepared the terrain and catalyzed new ways of 
interacting with each other, reframing the situation 
as one of adding value to the neighborhood 
collaboratively.
2.6 Building belief
“Everyone designs who devises courses of action 
aimed at changing existing situations into preferred 
ones.”
—Herbert Simon
For most stakeholders involved in “Welcome to Saint-
Gilles” - except for the educators and experts - it was 
their first encounter with design for social innovation. 
As such, it has been above everything else a valuable 
learning experience for them in many ways. Both sides 
have learnt the power and limitations of design aimed 
at changing a neighborhood’s existing situation into a 
preferred one, the kind of added value16 it can deliver 
through co-design and co-production of solutions. 
They have also learnt how in this process, design 
can lead to a change of roles and dynamics between 
stakeholders. But most of all, the major leap that has 
been taken is that of building belief, of realizing that a 
situation perceived as inert, unchangeable can actually 
be moved into a preferable direction. This shift and 
the catalytic activities leading up towards it, as such 
express the essence of design.
As such, “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” has proved a 
learning journey for many. Inhabitants, for example, 
learned that change in their local community is 
possible, and moreover that they can themselves 
can be the ones effectuating change with relatively 
little effort. They have learnt that by collaborating on 
initially relatively simple ideas - even naive perhaps in 
some cases - these ideas could be grown into valuable 
and robust concepts. Inhabitants learned that it is 
possible to align viewpoints and efforts of those who 
have a common stake in the future of their community: 
their neighbors, young and old, local civil servants and 
policymakers, local entrepreneurs, local authorities etc. 
As such, by breaking the barrier of silence and inertia, 
between “wish we could” and “can do”, doors have been

added value delivered through co-creation within a societal scope , 
i.e. transformation, ownership, learning, behavior change, happiness, 
survival.
opened, breaking new ground for future change. 
The way in which several of the student concepts 
have been adopted, adapted and are now being 
implemented by the local inhabitants bears testimony 
to this.
Celebrating small successes throughout the process 
is an important factor in building engagement and 
belief. Such moments can be simple yet powerful and 
be celebrated in myriad ways, e.g. a local policymaker 
or civil servant paying a visit to a meeting with local 
inhabitants, a video documenting local inhabitants 
actively involved in prototyping ‘their’ solution, etc. By 
rendering small successes and intermediate results 
tangible, by creating references through documented 
memories, belief is built and momentum is gained. 
In Saint-Gilles, posters on window panes spurred 
neighborhood dialogue, an exhibition celebrating 
the student projects brought people together to link 
up and discuss further, project flashcards visualized 
what a concept could lead to if implemented, allowed 
people to take ideas home physically and contained a 
link to its authors so people could get in touch. 
Thus, as touchpoints in general service design help to 
shape the user experience of those involved in using 
and/or providing the service, also in this case, simple 
touchpoints enabled a community of people to build 
belief in their ability to effectuate change.
2.7 CELEBRATING SERENDIPITY
“The song was there before me, before I came along.  
I just sorta came down and just sorta took it down 
with a pencil, but it was there before I came around.” 
—Bob Dylan
While highlighting the importance of managing 
expectations, we should also highlight the importance 
of leaving room for discovery of ideas that lie beyond 
the line of expectation. When facing a challenge, any 
solution-oriented person will seek to form himself/
herself an idea of how to tackle it, which soon 
becomes the seemingly single adequate solution. A 
key characteristic of design-driven modes of thought 
however is the ability to keep alternative options open, 
to not cling to any idea a priori.

ethnographic observation methods to urban variants
