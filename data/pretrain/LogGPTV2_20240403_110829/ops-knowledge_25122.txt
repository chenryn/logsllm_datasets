User: In the process of container orchestration using Kubernetes, when will the Pod be scheduled to a new node?
Assistant: Pods will be scheduled to new nodes in the following situations: 1. The Kubelet on the current node is down or unavailable, and Pods need to be scheduled to other nodes. 2. The current node resources are insufficient to meet the needs of Pods. 3. To increase or decrease the number of Pod replicas, the Pod needs to be scheduled to other nodes. 4. If the node label changes, the Pod needs to be scheduled to the corresponding node. 5. The scheduler reschedules Pods to solve node resource imbalance or optimize Pod scheduling. In summary, Pods may be scheduled on new nodes at any time for optimization and high availability.
