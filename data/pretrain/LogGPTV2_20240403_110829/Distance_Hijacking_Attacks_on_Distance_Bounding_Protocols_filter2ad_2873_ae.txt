and broadcasts his response to all veriﬁers. This many-to-
one challenge response then constitutes one round of the
underlying distance bounding protocol, which in this case
is Brands and Chaum’s original suggestion [4]. The authors
present a proof that their scheme is optimal in the sense that
it achieves the “maximal security” any location veriﬁcation
schemes based solely on time-of-ﬂight can provide.
Despite the proof, this scheme is vulnerable to Location
Hijacking (Figure 14). The proof in [6] establishes that a
prover must be at the claimed location (within some accuracy)
in order to correctly reply to the challenges. The proof
however, does not address the authentication of the node at the
claimed location but instead leaves that up to the underlying
distance bounding protocol. Since the underlying distance
bounding protocol is vulnerable to Distance Hijacking, the
location veriﬁcation protocol inherits this vulnerability. In
this case it is possible that another distance bounding protocol
could be used instead of Brands and Chaum, in order to
achieve a secure scheme, but this example shows that even
recent location veriﬁcation schemes with proofs of optimal
security, can be vulnerable to Location Hijacking.
VIII. RELATED WORK
Distance bounding for RFID tags: Avoine et al. present
in [1] a framework for analyzing RFID distance bounding
protocols. They give deﬁnitions for the three main attack
types, and also deﬁne Impersonation Fraud, in which “a
lonely prover purports to be another one” [1, p. 5], i. e., a
violation of weak authentication. They consider these four
types of attack with respect to black-box and white-box
provers, yielding a total of eight security notions. None of
their models covers Distance Hijacking attacks.
D¨urholz et al. propose in [10] the ﬁrst computational
formal framework for proving properties of RFID distance
bounding protocols that are based on shared symmetric keys.
Their framework considers an attacker that interacts only
with a single prover (the tag) and single veriﬁer (the reader).
Consequently, proving that an RFID protocol is secure in
their framework does not guarantee the absence of Distance
Hijacking attacks.
Formal models for distance bounding: Meadows et al.
developed a formal methodology to prove properties of
distance bounding protocols [18]. Because the methodology
is not particularly suited for dealing with dishonest provers,
they did not consider scenarios that would allow them to
detect Distance Hijacking attacks.
The ﬁrst two formal approaches for distance bounding
protocols that have considered multi-prover scenarios and
dishonest provers are Malladi et al. [25] and Basin et al.
[3]. Malladi et al. propose a tool-supported framework for
analyzing distance bounding protocols, and model a variant
of the ﬁrst signature-based protocol by Brands and Chaum.
They analyze this protocol in several scenarios and ﬁnd an
Figure 14.
Location Veriﬁcation
and Location Hijacking: P hijacks
the location of P (cid:2), for example by
hijacking the distance bounding pro-
tocol instances of P (cid:2) with respect to
the veriﬁers.

his location to the veriﬁers, P hijacks

distance bounding protocol to prove his proximity to a set of
veriﬁers. Based on the combined information, the veriﬁers
are able to verify the location of the prover.
This process is depicted in Figure 14. The circles represent
the measured distances by the veriﬁers V1, V2, V3, and they
conclude that P (cid:2) must be located in the intersection. If a
dishonest prover P can hijack distance bounding sessions of
a party P (cid:2), he can pretend to be at the location where P (cid:2)
resides, regardless of his actual location. This constitutes a
Location Hijacking attack: a dishonest prover can hijack the
location of P (cid:2).
Deﬁnition 6. Location Hijacking attack. A Location Hi-
jacking attack is an attack in which a dishonest prover P
exploits one or more honest parties P1, . . . , Pn to provide a
set of veriﬁers V1, . . . , Vk with false information about the
location of P (either absolute or relative to the location of
the veriﬁers).
The threat of hijacking is magniﬁed in the context of
location veriﬁcation, because multiple distance bounding
results are combined. For example, consider the setup in
Figure 15, in which three honest provers P1, P2, and P3 are
within range of the veriﬁers. As before, a dishonest prover can
perform Distance Hijacking attacks on the distance bounding
phases, thereby hijacking the location of P1, P2, or P3 as he
chooses. However, he can also combine Distance Hijacking
attacks with respect to multiple honest provers: this allows
him to make his location appear to be at any intersection
of the distances of a set of honest provers. For example, in
Figure 15, he can convince the veriﬁers that he is located
at the position indicated by the arrow, by combining the
distance bounding phases of the honest provers, even though
nobody is present at this location.
Case Study of Location Hijacking: To emphasize that
Location Hijacking is indeed a relevant problem, even on
recent protocols, we give a brief case study of a recent
protocol by Chiang et al. [6] that is vulnerable to Location
Hijacking. In this protocol a prover sends out a location
claim, after which he receives simultaneous challenges from

attack that falls into our class. In their “farther adversary”
scenario, the attacker is farther from the veriﬁer than the
reported distance. This suggests that the “farther adversary”
scenario covers both Distance Fraud and Distance Hijacking.
However, this observation is not consistent with Malladi
et al.’s statement that including the identity in the signature
makes the protocol secure in the “farther adversary” scenario.
From our analysis it is clear that the resulting protocol will
still be vulnerable to Distance Hijacking.
Basin et al. proposed in [3] the basic framework that we
have used here as a starting point for our extended model.
Basin et al. analyze a family of distance bounding protocols
proposed by Meadows et al. in [18] and ﬁnd an attack that
falls into our class of Distance Hijacking attacks, which
they refer to as an “impersonation attack”. They prove that
a concatenation-based version of the protocol is secure in
their framework. This protocol is not secure in our extended
framework, as the protocol is still vulnerable to a Distance
Hijacking attack that uses overshadowing.
Chosen Protocol attack: The multi-protocol Distance
Hijacking attack described in Section VI resembles the
Chosen Protocol (or Multi-Protocol) attack in cryptographic
protocol analysis, which was introduced by Kelsey, Schneier,
and Wagner [13]. They describe how, given any secure
cryptographic protocol, a second protocol can be constructed
(“chosen”) that is also secure, but when both are executed
in parallel, an attacker can use the second protocol to attack
the ﬁrst. Chosen Protocol attacks are an instance of Multi-
Protocol attacks [7]. In a traditional (Dolev-Yao style) setting,
Multi-Protocol attacks require that both protocols use the
same key infrastructure, in which case many protocols are
vulnerable [7]. Ensuring that the protocols use different keys
prevents the problem [11], which is often guaranteed in
practice. The practical threat of multi-protocol attacks in the
Dolev-Yao setting is therefore limited.
In contrast, our multi-protocol Distance Hijacking attacks
do not require that keys are shared among protocols. Rather,
the distance measurement phase must be regarded as a
security primitive, and care must be taken when security
primitives are shared among protocols. If not, unexpected
interactions can occur, as witnessed by our attacks. In practice,
multi-protocol Distance Hijacking poses a more signiﬁcant
threat
than Chosen Protocol attacks, because it can be
expected that only a few different hardware components
for distance measurement will be manufactured, which may
be used by a large number of different protocols.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
In many practical scenarios, including scenarios in which
Terrorist Fraud attacks are not a concern, Distance Hijacking
attacks can pose a serious threat. Surprisingly, until now, this
type of attack was not considered in the analysis of proposed
distance bounding protocols.
In fact, our analysis shows that many distance bounding
protocols cannot be safely used in scenarios with multiple
provers. Fortunately, it seems that adapting the protocols to be
resilient against these attacks is possible in single-protocol en-
vironments without imposing a signiﬁcant overhead. Similar
observations can be made for location veriﬁcation protocols
with respect to Location Hijacking attacks.
We introduced an extended framework to reason about
distance bounding protocols in a symbolic way, which at
the same time incorporates bit-level message manipulations
by the attacker. The results of this hybrid approach have
thus far been promising. The framework enables us to detect
more attacks than previous frameworks, including Distance
Hijacking attacks, and also allows us to prove the absence
of the attacks we found.
We proposed an exhaustive classiﬁcation of attacks on
distance bounding protocols. In this context, we also proposed
new names and deﬁnitions for the three classical attack types.
Our new attack names are less generic and more descriptive
than the previous names. We hope that
the exhaustive
classiﬁcation has a positive effect on the systematic analysis
of threats against distance bounding protocols.
It is clear that secure functioning in a context with multiple
provers is a desirable feature, giving an edge to those
protocols that are resilient against Distance Hijacking attacks.
It seems therefore prudent to analyze new proposals for
distance bounding protocols for their vulnerability to Distance
Hijacking.
