# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
Requiring or importing a json file starting with a byte order mark \ufeff,
commonly added by Microsoft editors, in webpack 4 causes the following error:
> Unexpected token ï»¿ in JSON at position 0
webpack 3 handles this though.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
