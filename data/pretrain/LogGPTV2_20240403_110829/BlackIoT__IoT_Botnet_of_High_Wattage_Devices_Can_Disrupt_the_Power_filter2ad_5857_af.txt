A Historical Blackouts Details
In this appendix, we brieÔ¨Çy review a few of the recent
blackouts in the power grids around the world to further
demonstrate the potential eÔ¨Äectiveness of the MadIoT at-
tacks.
A.1 The 2003 Blackout in the U.S. and
Canada
The August 14, 2003, blackout
in the U.S. and
Canada is one of the largest blackouts in history. It af-
fected an area with an estimated 50 million people and
61,800ùëÄùëä of power in the states of Ohio, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Con-
necticut, New Jersey and the Canadian province of On-
tario. According to the aftermath report [60], the fail-
ure started with a generator failure in Ohio due to an un-
derpredicted reactive load to serve high air conditioning
demand. After the initial failure, the Ohio grid opera-
tors were forced to import power which caused more line
failures due to overloads and lines touching nearby trees.
Within hours, the line failures cascaded and caused fail-
ure in major tie-lines between ISOs. This resulted in dis-
connection of the Eastern interconnection into East and
West parts which caused further frequency and voltage
instabilities and a large-scale blackout. The details of the
events leading to the blackout can be found in [60].
How an adversary could have initiated a similar sce-
nario? In a relatively hot summer day (but not the hottest
day), an adversary could have initiated the same event by
overloading the Ohio system by increasing the reactive
power demand by remotely starting several air condition-
ers. This could cause an unexpected shortage in reactive
power generation and possibly the same generator failure
and consequent voltage collapse events.
A.2 The 2003 Blackout in Italy
The September 28, 2003, blackout was the most se-
rious blackout in Italy and caused an outage almost ev-
erywhere in Italy. At around 3pm in the afternoon, Italy
was importing 3,610ùëÄùëä and 2,212ùëÄùëä of power from
Switzerland and France, about 600ùëÄùëä and 400ùëÄùëä
above their scheduled exchange agreements, respectively.
At this time, one of the tie-lines between Switzerland and
Italy tripped due to an overload and touching a tree. This
resulted in an overload in another tie-line between the two
countries and tripping of the second line. After, the sec-
ond line failure, further lines between Italy and France,
Austria, and Slovenia tripped due to overloads and caused
the Italian grid to be disconnected from the continental
European grid. This resulted in a huge imbalance be-
tween supply and demand within Italy and a frequency
drop that could not be recovered despite further aggres-
sive load shedding. The details of the events leading to
this blackout can be found in [59].
How an adversary could have initiated a similar sce-
nario? An adversary could actively monitor the power
Ô¨Çow on the tie-lines through European grids‚Äô websites
and overload the tie-lines by increasing power demand in
Italy and possibly decreasing power demand in Switzer-
land or France. This could have resulted in the failure of
the same tie-lines and subsequent failures.
A.3 The
2011 Blackout
Southern California
in Arizona-
The September 8, 2011, Arizona-Southern California
aÔ¨Äected approximately 2.7 million people. It started with
a single high voltage line failure due to a fault which re-
distributed power towards the San Diego area on a hot
day during hours of peak demand. Within minutes this
redistribution of power resulted in more line and trans-
former failures (which are modeled as line failures in sim-
ulations in the previous section) and eventually separa-
tion of the San Diego area from rest of the Western Inter-
connection. This separation resulted in a huge imbalance
between the supply and demand in the San Diego area and
a frequency drop which caused generation tripping and a
blackout. The details of the events can be found in [9].
How an adversary could have initiated a similar sce-
nario? An adversary could have caused the same initial
line failure (which was operating within 78% of its capac-
ity) by increasing the demand in the San Diego area and
possibly reducing the demand in Arizona.
A.4 The 2016 Blackout in South Australia
The September 28, 2016, blackout in South Australia
aÔ¨Äected approximately 1 million customers. Extreme
weather conditions on September 28 caused failure in
three transmission lines. Following these failures, there
was a 456ùëÄùëä reduction in wind generation in the South
Australia grid which resulted in an increase in imported
power and further tripping of the tie-lines. As a result,
the South Australia grid was separated from rest of the
Australian grid. This resulted in 900ùëÄùëä imbalance is
supply and demand, and a sudden drop in the frequency
which caused a blackout in the system. The details of
these events can be found in [13].
What is special about this blackout is that a big portion
of the electric power in South Australia in generated by
wind turbines and solar panels (about 75%) which have
very low inertia. This is the main reason for the very
quick drop in the frequency after the separation of the
South Australian grid from the rest of the interconnec-
tion, without the grid operator having a chance to respond
to the imbalance by load shedding. This event, in particu-
lar, shows that in places or times that renewable resources
have a higher share of the power generation, the grid is

much more vulnerable to the MadIoT attacks that cause
sudden increases in the demand.
How an adversary could have initiated a similar sce-
nario? Due to the low inertia of the South Australian
grid, the sudden increase in the demand by an adversary
in the area should be compensated by the tie-lines. This,
depending on the amount of the increase, can potentially
result in the overload of the tie-lines and their failure.
Once they fail and the system is islanded, it may collapse
because of the supply and demand imbalance and a quick
frequency drop.
