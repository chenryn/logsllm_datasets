### Cryptographic Mechanisms Supported by Servers

The number of investigated servers was significantly lower, at approximately 20,000. Yilek et al. [14] examined the repercussions of the Debian OpenSSL bug from 2008. This bug led to weak randomness in key generation, allowing for the pre-computation of affected public/private key pairs. The authors tracked the impact of this error over a period of about 200 days and scanned around 50,000 hosts.

### Challenges with Scans

A common issue with scans is that they often include hosts not intended for TLS/SSL access, leading to invalid or default certificates. Therefore, the percentages reported in [8, 9, 10, 11] should be interpreted with caution. Our actively collected data sets focus on high-ranked domains from the Alexa Top 1 Million list, observed over an extended period. High-ranked domains are more likely to use TLS/SSL, especially those in the top 1,000 or 10,000. Our monitoring approach minimizes the inclusion of irrelevant hosts, enabling us to estimate the deployment of TLS/SSL infrastructure and analyze the active usage of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Additionally, our analysis captures changes made by operators over 1.5 years and provides insights into how users experience TLS/SSL-secured infrastructure globally. We also incorporate EFF data from related work, enhancing previous results through our own evaluation algorithms and providing better comparability.

### Data Sets

#### 4.1 Active Scans

For our scans, we used the Alexa Top 1 Million Hosts list [12], which ranks the most popular web hosts. Although the accuracy of this list is debated, it serves our purpose of identifying frequently visited sites. Each entry was expanded to two host names: one with and one without the "www" prefix. Before conducting the actual certificate scans, we performed nmap scans on TCP port 443 to filter out closed ports. Our SSL scanning tool, based on OpenSSL, attempts a full TLS/SSL handshake on port 443 for each host name, storing the complete certificate chain and other relevant data when successful.

#### 4.2 Passive Monitoring

We monitored all TLS/SSL traffic entering and leaving the Munich Scientific Research Network (MWN) in Germany. This network connects three major universities and affiliated research institutions, serving about 120,000 users with an average link load of 2 Gbit/s inbound and 1 Gbit/s outbound during peak hours. We conducted two monitoring runs, improving our software setup between them while keeping the hardware (a four-core Intel Core i7 with hyper-threading and a 10 GE network interface) the same.

To handle the high traffic volume, both runs used a sampling algorithm to capture the first n bytes of each bi-flow, sufficient for extracting the X.509 certificates exchanged during the TLS/SSL session setup. In the first run, we captured and dumped the beginning of each bi-flow, sampling up to 15 kB per bi-flow. In the second run, we employed an optimized online analysis system, running six instances in parallel and analyzing up to 400 kB of traffic data per bi-flow with minimal packet loss. We used Bro [21] as the TLS/SSL processing tool, with patches to extract and store complete certificate chains.

#### 4.3 Data Properties

Table 1 summarizes the locations, dates, and number of certificates in our different data sets. Our data sets can be categorized into four classes:

1. **German Scans**: Conducted from hosts at the University of Tübingen and TU München between November 2009 and April 2011, covering a 1.5-year period. An additional scan in April 2011 included SNI, a TLS extension that allows the server to select an appropriate certificate based on the host name passed in the TLS handshake.

2. **Geographically Distributed Scans**: Performed in April 2011 using PlanetLab nodes from various countries to provide a global perspective on TLS/SSL deployment. This helped identify location-dependent factors such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which use DNS to route clients to different computing centers based on their geographic location.

### Conclusion

Our comprehensive approach, combining active scans and passive monitoring, provides a detailed and accurate view of TLS/SSL deployment and usage. By incorporating data from multiple sources and employing advanced analysis techniques, we offer valuable insights into the security and reliability of the PKI infrastructure.
