# Verifiable Attribute-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (AB-PRE) Schemes

## 5.5. Comparisons

We compare our work with previous AB-PRE schemes in terms of computation costs, functionality, and security. Given the resource constraints of users, we focus on the computational costs associated with encryption, re-encryption key generation, and decryption for both original and re-encrypted ciphertexts.

To the best of our knowledge, our schemes are the first to achieve re-encryption verifiability for AB-PRE, which ensures the correctness of re-encrypted ciphertexts and simultaneously detects malicious behavior by the proxy. As shown in Table II, our verification process requires only two modular exponentiation operations for both encryption and decryption. Our re-encryption process adds one more pairing operation during decryption, whereas other schemes [6, 20] result in more than double the computational cost for both modular exponentiation and pairing operations during decryption. The computational costs of our AB-VPRE-2 and AB-VPRE-3 schemes for users are lower than those of [6] and [20], respectively. The re-encryption computations in our schemes can be outsourced to a public cloud, and the returned ciphertexts will be verified. Although the schemes in [6, 20] achieve CCA security, they do not guarantee that qualified users receive the correct data without verifying the correctness of the re-encrypted ciphertexts.

### Table II: Comparisons
| Scheme | KP/CP | Verify Re-enc | Data Privacy | Enc | RKGen | Dec | REVer.Dec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ref. [2] | CP | - | CPA | (n + 3)E | (3n + 4)E | (3m + 6)E | (3m + 2n' + 14)E |
| Ref. [6] | CP | - | CCA | (n + 5)E | (3n + 4)E | (3m + 5)E | (3m + n' + 6)E |
| Ref. [20] | KP | - | CCA | (n + 1)P | (3m' + 1)E + (3m' + 10)P | (2m' + 4)E + 4P | 2E + (n + 1)P |
| AB-VPRE-1 | CP | X | CPA | (m' + 2)E + (2m' + 1)P | (2m' + 2)E + 2P | (n + 2)P | (8m' + 4)E + (7m' + 24)P |
| AB-VPRE-2 | CP | X | CPA | (m' + 2)E + (2m' + 2)P | (2m' + 2)E + 3P | (n' + 5)E | ((λ + 1)m + n' + 5)E |
| AB-VPRE-3a | KP | X | CPA | (n' + 5)E | ((λ + 2)m + n' + 7)E | (n' + 7)E | ((λ + 2)m + n' + 14)E |

**Notes:**
- E and P denote a modular exponentiation and a pairing operation, respectively.
- \( n \), \( n' \), \( m \), \( m' \), and \( \lambda \) indicate the number of attributes in the universe \( U \), the size of the attribute set \( S \), the number of rows in the secret-sharing matrix \( A \), the number of rows used during decryption for LSSS, and the number of distinct attributes that appear in \( A \), respectively.

## 6. Conclusions

In AB-PRE, where the public cloud acts as the proxy, the re-encryption process may not always be performed honestly. We propose a technique to verify re-encryption, ensuring the correctness of re-encrypted ciphertexts. We present a generic construction of AB-PRE with verifiable re-encryption and provide three instantiations in both KP and CP settings. Compared to previous AB-PRE schemes, our schemes require less computation for resource-constrained users and enable efficient verification.
