5.5. Comparisons
We compare our work with previous AB-PRE schemes
in terms of computation costs, functionality, and security.
Considering the resource-constrained users, we mainly dis-
cuss the computation costs of encryption, re-encryption
key generation, and decryption for original and re-
encrypted ciphertexts, respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, our schemes are the ﬁrst
to achieve re-encryption veriﬁability for AB-PRE, which
guarantees the correctness of the re-encrypted ciphertexts
and simultaneously detects the malicious behaviors of
the proxy. As shown in Table II, our veriﬁcation only
requires two modular exponential operations for encryp-
tion and decryption, respectively. Our re-encryption leads
to one more pairing operation during decryption, while
others [6,20] result in more than doubled computation
costs on both modular exponential and pairing operations
for decryption. Our computation costs of AB-VPRE-2
and AB-VPRE-3 for the users are less than [6] and [20],
respectively. The computation for the re-encryption of our
schemes can be outsourced to the public cloud, and the

returned ciphertexts will be veriﬁed. The schemes of [6,20]
achieve CCA security but still cannot guarantee that the
qualiﬁed users receive the correct data without any check
for the correctness of the re-encrypted ciphertexts.
6. CONCLUSIONS
For AB-PRE where the public cloud is modeled as the
proxy, the re-encryption may not be performed honestly.
We propose a technique to verify the re-encryption such
that the correctness of the re-encrypted ciphertexts can be
guaranteed. We present a generic construction of AB-PRE
with veriﬁable re-encryption and provide three instanti-
ations in both KP and CP settings. Compared with the
AB-PRE schemes proposed before, our schemes require
less computation for the resource-constrained users and the
veriﬁcation can be achieved efﬁciently.
