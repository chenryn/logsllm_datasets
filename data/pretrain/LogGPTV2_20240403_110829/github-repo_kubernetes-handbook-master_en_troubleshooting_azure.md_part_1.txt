# Troubleshooting Azure Cloud Provider
## Azure Load Balancer (ALB)
When Azure cloud provider is configured (`kube-controller-manager --cloud-provider=azure --cloud-config=/etc/kubernetes/azure.json`), Azure load balancer (ALB) will be created automatically for `LoadBalancer` typed Service. Please note that only `Basic` SKU ALB is supported now, which has some [limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview) compared to `Standard` ALB:
| Load Balancer                     | Basic                                    | Standard                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Back-end pool size                | up to 100                                | up to 1,000                              |
| Back-end pool boundary            | Availability Set                         | virtual network, region                  |
| Back-end pool design              | VMs in Availability Set, virtual machine scale set in Availability Set | Any VM instance in the virtual network   |
| HA Ports                          | Not supported                            | Available                                |
| Diagnostics                       | Limited, public only                     | Available                                |
| VIP Availability                  | Not supported                            | Available                                |
| Fast IP Mobility                  | Not supported                            | Available                                |
| Availability Zones scenarios      | Zonal only                               | Zonal, Zone-redundant, Cross-zone load-balancing |
| Outbound SNAT algorithm           | On-demand                                | Preallocated                             |
| Outbound SNAT front-end selection | Not configurable, multiple candidates    | Optional configuration to reduce candidates |
| Network Security Group            | Optional on NIC/subnet                   | Required                                 |
Public IP associated is Basic SKU, which has some [limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview#sku-service-limits-and-abilities) compared to `Standard` Public IP:
| Public IP                    | Basic           | Standard                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Availability Zones scenarios | Zonal only      | Zone-redundant (default), zonal (optional) |
| Fast IP Mobility             | Not supported   | Available                                |
| VIP Availability             | Not supported   | Available                                |
| Counters                     | Not supported   | Available                                |
| Network Security Group       | Optional on NIC | Required                                 |
When creating LoadBalancer Service, a set of annotations could be set to customize ALB:
| Annotation                               | Comments                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal | If set, create internal load balancer    |
| service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet | Set subnet for internal load balancer    |
| service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-mode | Determine how to select ALB based on availability sets. Candidate values are: 1）Not set or empty, use `primaryAvailabilitySet` set in `/etc/kubernetes/azure.json`; 2）`auto`, select ALB which has the minimum rules associated ; 3）`as1,as2`, specify a list of availability sets |
| service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name | Set DNS label name                       |
| service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-shared-securityrule | If set, NSG will be shared with other services. This relies on [Augmented Security Rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#augmented-security-rules) |
| service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group | Specify the resource group of load balancer objects that are not in the same resource group as the cluster |
## Checking logs and events
ALB is managed by kube-controller-manager or cloud-controller-manager in kubernetes. So whenever there are problems with Azure cloud provider, their logs should be checked fist:
```sh
# kube-controller-manager
PODNAME=$(kubectl -n kube-system get pod -l component=kube-controller-manager -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl -n kube-system logs $PODNAME --tail 100
# cloud-controller-manager
PODNAME=$(kubectl -n kube-system get pod -l component=cloud-controller-manager -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl -n kube-system logs $PODNAME --tail 100
```
Resources events are also helpful, e.g. for Service
```sh
kubectl describe service 
```
## LoadBalancer Service stuck in Pending
When checking a service by `kubectl describe service `, there is no error events. But its externalIP status is stuck in ``. This indicates something wrong when provisioning ALB/PublicIP/NSG. In such case, `kube-controller-manager` logs should be checked.
An incomplete list of things that could go wrong include:
- Authorization failed because of cloud-config misconfigured, e.g. clientId, clientSecret, tenantId, subscriptionId, resourceGroup. Fix the configuation in `/etc/kubernetes/azure.json` should solve the problem.
- Client configured is not authorized to ALB/PublicIP/NSG. Add authorization in Azure portal or create a new one (`az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions//resourceGroups/"` and update `/etc/kubernetes/azure.json` on all nodes) should solve the problem
- There is also a NSG issue in Kubernetes v1.8.X: `Security rule must specify SourceAddressPrefixes, SourceAddressPrefix, or SourceApplicationSecurityGroups`. To get rid of this issue, you could either upgrade cluster to v1.9.X/v1.10.X or replace SourceAddressPrefixes rule with multiple SourceAddressPrefix rules.
## Service external IP is not accessible
Azure Cloud Provider creates a health probe for each Kubernetes services and only probe-successful backend VMs are added to Azure Load Balancer (ALB). If the external IP is not accessible, it's probably caused by health probing.
An incomplete list of such cases include:
- Backend VMs in unhealthy (Solution: login the VM and check, or restart VM)
- Containers are not listening on configured ports (Solution: correct container port configuration)
- Firewall or network security groups block the port on ALB (Solution: add a new rule to expose the port)
- If an ILB VIP is configured inside a VNet, and one of the participant backend VMs is trying to access the Internal Load Balancer VIP, that results in failure. This is an [unsupported scenario](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-troubleshoot#cause-4-accessing-the-internal-load-balancer-vip-from-the-participating-load-balancer-backend-pool-vm). (Solution: use service's clusterIP instead)
- Some or all containers are not responding any accesses. Note that only part of containers not responding could result in service not accessible, this is because
  - Azure probes service periodically by `NodeIP:NodePort`
  - Then, on the Node, kube-proxy load balances it to backend containers
  - And then, if it load balances the access to abnormal containers, then probe is failed and the Node VM may be removed from ALB traffic backends
  - Finally, ALB may think all backends are unhealthy
  - The solution is use [Readiness Probles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/), which could ensure the unhealthy containers removed from service's endpoints
## No target backends present for the internal load balancer (ILB)
This is a known bug ([kubernetes#59746](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/59746) [kubernetes#60060](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60060) [acs-engine#2151](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/issues/2151)) in kubernetes v1.9.0-v1.9.3, which is caused by an error when matching ILB's AvaibilitySet.
The fix of this issue ([kubernetes#59747](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59747) [kubernetes#59083](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59083)) will be included in v1.9.4+ and v1.10+.
## No target backends present for the external load balancer
If kubelet is not configured with cloud provider (e.g. no `--cloud-provider=azure --cloud-config=/etc/kubernetes/cloud-config` configured), then the node will not join any Azure load balancers. This is because the node registers itself with externalID hostname, which is not recognized by kube-controller-manager.
A simple way to check is comparing externalID and name (they should be different):
```sh
$ kubectl get node -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'
k8s-agentpool1-27347916-0
$ kubectl get node -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.externalID}'
/subscriptions//resourceGroups//providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/k8s-agentpool1-27347916-0
```
To fix this issue
- Delete the node object `kubectl delete node `
- Set Kubelet with options `--cloud-provider=azure --cloud-config=/etc/kubernetes/cloud-config`
- Finally restart kubelet
## PublicIP not removed after deleting LoadBalancer service
This is a known issue ([kubernetes#59255](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/59255)) in v1.9.0-1.9.3: ALB has a default quota of 10 FrontendIPConfiguations for Basic ALB. When this quota is exceeded, ALB FrontendIPConfiguation won't be created but cloud provider continues to create PublicIPs for those services. And after deleting the services, those PublicIPs not removed togather.
The fix of this issue ([kubernetes#59340](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59340)) will be included in v1.9.4+ and v1.10+.
Besides the fix, if more than 10 LoadBalancer services are required in your cluster, you should also increase FrontendIPConfiguations quota to make it work. Check [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits) for how to do this.
