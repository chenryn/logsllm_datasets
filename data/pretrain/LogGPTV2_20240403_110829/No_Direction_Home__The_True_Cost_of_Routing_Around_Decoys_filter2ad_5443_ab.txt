description of the other factors can be found in the BGP
speciﬁcation [22].
B3 Business preference (highest Local-Pref) This factor
selects routes with the best beneﬁt for the router’s AS. This
beneﬁt is usually monetary. Typically, B3 prefers paths that
route through a customer, then those that route through a peer,
and ﬁnally those that route through a provider. This is due to
the AS business relationships described in Section II-A, e.g.,
routing through a peer is free while routing through a provider
costs money.
B4 Shortest AS path The fourth decision factor is the path
length, i.e., the number of ASes in the path from the source
AS to the destination preﬁx. Path length affects the quality
of service of the connection, hence it comes immediately after
the business preference factor. A path composed of more ASes
is susceptible to higher network latencies, lower throughputs,
and more frequent network failures.
B. RBGP routing
The RAD attack changes how BGP routers choose AS
paths. BGP routers controlled by a RAD adversary use a
modiﬁed list of decision factors to select the best path to
a given destination; we call such routers RBGP routers. An
RBGP router has two objectives that distinguish it from a
standard BGP router.
Avoiding decoy routers: Because the main intention of a
RAD adversary is to avoid paths that contain decoy routers,
an RBGP router simply discards all paths that pass through at
least one decoy AS.
use decoy-free paths known to other RAD ASes, regardless of
the business relation between these ASes. In other words, a
RAD AS who knows a decoy-free path to a given destination
transits the trafﬁc of other RAD ASes to that destination even
if this contradicts the standard BGP decision factors.
For instance, if a Chinese AS does not have a decoy-
free path to a certain destination, it can re-route trafﬁc to
that destination through one of the other 198 ASes in China,
e.g., a customer AS or an AS with which it has no business
relationship. This is a key factor in the success of the RAD
attack, because it increases the number of alternative paths
available to the RAD ASes. The resulting routes may be invalid
(NVF) routes, as deﬁned in Section II-A. While the RAD paper
does not describe in detail how re-routing is performed, it
suggests the use of network engineering tools such as MPLS
VPN tunnels [23, Section 3.1] across all ASes controlled by
the RAD adversary. In the rest of this paper, we will argue that,
regardless of the networking technique used to implement re-
routing, it will be extremely costly to the ASes involved.
To achieve the two objectives described above, an RBGP
router uses a different list of decision factors (compared to
BGP) for ﬁnding the best path to a given Internet destination.
This list is shown in Table II. It adds two new decision factors:
R1 (Ignore if the route includes decoy ASes) and R2 (Prefer
VF routes over NVF routes). The latter factor is necessary
because NVF routes are much more costly than VF routes.
IV. THE COSTS OF RAD ROUTING
The non-standard decision factors used by RBGP impose
additional costs on the ASes controlled by the RAD adversary.
These costs fall into several categories: (1) collateral damage
(e.g., social unrest) caused by the fact that signiﬁcant parts of
the Internet become unreachable; (2) collateral damage due to
the signiﬁcantly lowered quality of service for the customers
of the RAD-controlled ASes; 3) monetary costs for buying and
deploying new networking equipment; and 4) monetary costs
due to switching to more expensive Internet routes.
Intuitively, all of these costs stem from one main reason.
The standard list of decision factors used by conventional BGP
routers aims to minimize ASes’ routing costs and to maximize
the quality of service for their network trafﬁc. Therefore, any
change to these decision factors is likely to increase their costs,
decrease quality of service, or both.
In the following, we describe the negative impacts of RAD
routing, arranged by type.
Trafﬁc re-routing: If a RAD AS does not have a decoy-free
path to a given destination, the RAD paper suggests that it can

RAD-controlled ASes from an Internet destination unless the
RAD adversary can ﬁnd a decoy-free path to that destination.
By deﬁnition, a large number of disconnected destinations
means that the attack has failed (see Section II-C).
RBGP routers may be forced to selected non-valley-free (NVF)
paths in order to avoid decoy ASes. Such paths are extremely
expensive, which is why they are shunned by normal BGP
routers.
2. Less-preferred paths (Business) As explained in
Section III-A, one of the ﬁrst decision factors that standard
BGP routers consider is the business relationship between the
router’s AS and the ﬁrst AS of a candidate interdomain path
(the decision factor B3). In RBGP, however, two other decision
factors, R1 and R2, have higher priority. As a result, it is likely
that for some destination the RBGP router selects a path with
a lower business preference compared to what a standard BGP
router would have selected.
For example, suppose that a router chooses between two
paths to some destination: path A goes through a provider and
contains no decoy ASes, while path B goes through a peer
and contains a decoy AS. A standard BGP router would have
selected path B because it is cheaper, but an RBGP router will
select the more expensive path, A.
3. Longer paths (Length) As explained in Section III-A,
one of the top standard decision factors of BGP is the length of
the available paths (factor B4). Based on this factor, a standard
BGP router prefers the path that contains the fewest transit
ASes. This helps maximize quality of service for routed trafﬁc
because longer paths may have higher latency and are more
susceptible to network failures. For RBGP routers, B4 is lower
in the preference order, which may cause them to select longer
paths than BGP routers.
4. Higher path latencies (Latency) Longer routes are
not the only cause of higher latencies. The alternative paths
selected by RBGP are likely to pass through less popular transit
ASes that offer lower capacity, causing packets to experience
higher latencies. This is conﬁrmed by our simulations in
Section VII, which show that, even when an RBGP path has
the same length as the corresponding BGP path, it usually has
higher latency.
5. Non-valley-free routes (Valley) As explained above,
Suppose that for a given Internet destination, a RAD AS
A has no decoy-free BGP path and must use the path known
to another RAD AS B. In this example, either A has to pay
B for transiting A’s trafﬁc (A would not have had to pay B if
A had used standard BGP), or else B has to pay the expenses
for transiting A’s trafﬁc (e.g., to B’s provider). Additionally,
the source AS A may have to pay its own provider in order to
transit trafﬁc to B. The monetary costs of Valley are likely
to be much worse than Business costs.
6. New transit ASes (NewTransit) The RAD attack relies
on the fact that the ASes under the adversary’s control transit
trafﬁc for each other (see Section II-C). However, only a small
fraction of ASes under the control of a typical RAD adversary
are transit ASes and thus have the requisite network equipment
and resources.
For instance, China has 199 ASes, but only 30 of them
are transit ASes. For the RAD attack to be successful, the
RAD adversary needs to transform many of the edge ASes into
transit ASes. Changing a typical edge AS to a transit AS is
extremely costly since it requires the purchase and installation
of sophisticated networking equipment.
7. Massive changes in transit load (TransitLoad) Transit
ASes earn money by transiting other ASes’ trafﬁc. On the
other hand, transiting this trafﬁc imposes signiﬁcant ﬁxed and
variable costs, including equipment, network management, etc.
Our simulations in Section VII shows that the RAD attack
signiﬁcantly changes the transit load of the transit ASes under
the RAD adversary’s control. Due to the routing changes
caused by the RAD attack, some transit ASes lose a large
fraction of their transit trafﬁc (and thus lose money), while
other transit ASes must handle tremendous increases in their
transit load.

V. PLACING DECOY ROUTERS
For a decoy routing system to become operational, it must
be deployed by several autonomous systems (decoy ASes) who
are economically or politically motivated to assist in censorship
circumvention. The number of the decoy ASes as well as
their location in the Internet are important factors determining
whether a decoy routing system can withstand the RAD attack.
The original RAD paper simulated the RAD attack for two
speciﬁc placements of decoy ASes: top-tier and random. The
former placement assumes that the decoys are deployed in
top-tier Internet ASes, while the latter assumes that the ASes
for decoy deployment are chosen randomly from the set of
all 44,000 ASes. Analysis in the RAD paper suggests that
the RAD attack fails against the top-tier placement because it
results in disconnecting the RAD adversary from large parts of
the Internet. The RAD paper observes, however, that top-tier
placement is expensive and may not be practically feasible.
For the random placement, the RAD paper shows that if
decoys are deployed in a small, random fraction of all ASes,
the RAD adversary is disconnected only from a small part of
the Internet—mainly from the decoy ASes themselves—thus
the RAD attack is considered successful.
We believe that the random decoy placement analyzed
in [24] is biased in favor of the RAD adversary and does
not reﬂect how the RAD attack would fare against a realistic
decoy deployment strategy. Based on the AS ranking statistics,
available from CAIDA,3 we observe that 86.2% of all ASes
are edge ASes,
the size of their customer cone is 1
(see Section II-A). Therefore, the random decoy placement
considered in [24] is likely to place decoys primarily into edge
ASes. Obviously, evading an edge AS disconnects the RAD
adversary only from that AS because it is not on the path to
any other AS.
i.e.,
We argue that, in any realistic deployment, decoy routers
should be placed in transit ASes, not edge ASes, even in the
absence of a RAD adversary. The larger the customer cone of
an AS, the better it serves as a decoy AS, for two reasons:
(1) an AS with a larger customer cone is on the path to
more ASes, thus the RAD attack is likely to disconnect the
adversary from these “downstream” ASes, too, and (2) even
in the absence of a RAD adversary, placing decoys on ASes
with larger customer cones provides better unobservability for
decoy routing clients and gives them more options for choosing
their overt destinations.
For example, suppose that a decoy routing system is
installed only in a single edge AS. In this case, its clients’
options for overt destinations are limited to the destinations
belonging to that single AS. Therefore, a user who frequently
visits destinations within the decoy AS may raise the censor’s
suspicion that the user is engaging in decoy routing. On the
other hand, if decoys are installed in a transit AS with a
customer cone of 5, then a decoy routing client can choose
overt destinations from 5 ASes, resulting in better connectivity
and better unobservability.
Based on these observations, we propose the following
strategic decoy placement strategies, which are much more
3http://as-rank.caida.org/
likely to defeat the RAD attack than the random placement
considered in [24].
Sorted placement (sorted):
In this approach, decoy ASes
are chosen from among the ASes that transit more trafﬁc for
the RAD adversary. Speciﬁcally, we sort ASes based on the
number of times they appear on the BGP routes of the RAD
adversary’s ASes. We then choose decoy ASes from the top
of this sorted list. We exclude all ASes controlled by the RAD
adversary, i.e., Chinese ASes if China is the adversary.
We propose two types of sorted placements. In the
sorted-with-ring placement, decoy ASes are chosen
from the set of all ASes not directly controlled by the RAD
adversary (i.e., non-Chinese ASes in the case of China). In
the sorted-no-ring placement, we additionally exclude
all ASes that have a direct business relationship with the RAD
adversary, since they are less likely to deploy decoy routers.
We use the term ring ASes for the ASes that are not controlled
by the adversary, but have a business relationship. From our
data sources (see Section VI), we identiﬁed 551, 69, and 5
ring ASes for China, Venezuela, and Syria, respectively.
Strategic random placement (random): Instead of selecting
random ASes from the set of all ASes, as suggested in [24],
our random placement strategy selects ASes from the set of
all ASes with a given customer cone size. In a random-C
placement strategy, decoy ASes are chosen randomly from
the set of all ASes with a customer cone size larger than or
equal to C. Our random-1 strategy is thus the exact random
strategy suggested in [24] (since 1 is the minimum value for
the customer cone size). Similar to the sorted placement,
we further subdivide random-C placement into two types:
random-with-ring-C and random-no-ring-C. Both
exclude adversary-controlled ASes, and the latter additionally
excludes all ring ASes that have a direct business relationship
with an adversary-controlled AS.
VI. SIMULATION SETUP AND DATA SOURCES
We use simulation to estimate the various costs imposed by
RBGP routing on the RAD adversary, described in Section IV.
Our simulator uses CBGP [21], a popular BGP simulator,
as its engine, and a Python interface to interact with CBGP
and query for BGP routes between ASes. The rest of the
simulations are performed in Python.
We use several sources of Internet measurements in our
simulations:
• Geo location: We use the “GeoLite Country” dataset from
GeoLite’s geolocation database4 to map IP addresses to
countries.
• AS relations: We use CAIDA’s inferred AS relationship
dataset,5 which is based on [11], to model the relationships
between ASes.
• AS ranking: We use CAIDA’s AS rank dataset6 to infer
the customer cones of individual ASes.

to estimate BGP and RBGP path latencies. This dataset
contains daily latency measurements between different
points-of-presence (PoP) of ASes.
• Network origin: We use iPlane’s “Origin AS mapping”
dataset to map IP address preﬁxes to the corresponding
ASes.
VII. SIMULATION RESULTS
The success of the RAD attack depends on the placement of
decoys in ASes. Therefore, we evaluate the costs of the attack
for different placement strategies described in Section V. In all
cases, we assume that the RAD adversary knows the identities
of all ASes that deploy the decoys. Obviously, this assumption
favors the adversary.
A RAD adversary is a censorship authority who controls
a large number of ASes and forces them to modify their BGP
decisions as described in Section III-B. Intuitively, a RAD
adversary’s Internet connectivity is proportional to the number
of ASes it controls and the number of its ring ASes (see Sec-
tion V). The larger these numbers, the more alternative routes
are likely to be available to the RAD adversary for any given
Internet destination. As mentioned before, the RAD attack is
successful only if it does not disconnect the adversary’s ASes
from many ASes in the rest of the Internet.
This suggests that China is the most powerful RAD adver-
sary because it controls a large number of ASes (199) and is
connected to more ring ASes than other state-level censors (see
Table III). We demonstrate this by comparing China’s success
as a RAD adversary with other censoring countries, such as
Venezuela (44 ASes) and Syria (3 ASes).
Figure 4 shows the percentage of ASes that become
unreachable as a consequence of the RAD attack, assuming
sorted-no-ring decoy placement. This shows that China
signiﬁcantly outperforms Syria and Venezuela in maintaining
its connectivity with the rest of the Internet.
For the rest of the simulations, we only report the results
for China. The simulations were performed for two different
scenarios:
•
China-World: China is the RAD adversary; decoy
ASes are chosen, using different placement strategies
from Section V, from all 44,000 ASes excluding the
199 ASes located in China (we additionally exclude
the 551 ring ASes of China in the case of no-ring
placements, as described in Section V). The costs of
the RAD attack are then estimated for connections
from China to all Internet destinations across the
world, excluding the Chinese destinations.

assuming the sorted-no-ring decoy placement strategy.
•
China-US: China is the RAD adversary; decoy
ASes are selected only from the 13,299 ASes lo-
cated in the United States. This scenario represents
a geographically limited deployment of decoy routers.
In this case, the costs of the RAD attack are only
estimated for the Internet destinations inside the US.
As above, China’s ring ASes are excluded in the
no-ring deployments.
A. Loss of connectivity
Figure 5 shows the percentage of Internet ASes that be-
come unreachable from China under different placement strate-
gies and for different numbers of decoy ASes. As described
above, for the China-US scenario both decoy ASes and
destination ASes are only selected from the US-based ASes,
while for the China-World scenario they are selected from
all non-Chinese ASes.
The random-no-ring-1 placement is exactly the place-
ment studied in the RAD paper [24], where it was called
“random” placement. Following the RAD paper [24], our
simulations conﬁrm that random-no-ring-1 mainly dis-
connects China from the decoy ASes only. This happens
because the majority of the Internet ASes have small customer
cones (see Figure 2) and random placement is likely to choose
many of these ASes.
When decoy ASes are selected from among the non-edge
ASes, China’s connectivity drops signiﬁcantly. For instance,
for the random-no-ring-5 placement (i.e., choosing tran-
sit ASes with a minimum customer cone of 5), placing decoys
in only 5% of global ASes disconnects China from around 43%
