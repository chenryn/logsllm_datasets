According to the documentation, the "group" field is a special type that creates two identical fields whose values must match; otherwise, a validation error is thrown. This is commonly used for verifying the accuracy of passwords or email addresses by requiring the user to enter the same value twice.

In other words, if the values in the repeated fields do not match, the form should be considered invalid. However, when a form with mismatched values in the repeated fields is submitted, `Form::isValid` returns `true`, and no validation error is thrown. Instead, the value from the repeated field is set to `null`. While the `null` value may be expected, it raises the question: **why is the form still considered valid?**

There is a relevant error in `Form::$transformationFailure`, but this does not seem to affect the form's error handling. To illustrate this issue, I have created a small Silex application with a repeated field.

If this behavior is expected, please feel free to close this issue. In that case, the documentation should be updated to clarify the expected behavior of the repeated field type.
