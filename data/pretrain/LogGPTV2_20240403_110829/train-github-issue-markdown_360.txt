From the docs:
> This is a special field "group", that creates two identical fields whose
> values must match (or a validation error is thrown). The most common use is
> when you need the user to repeat their password or email to verify accuracy.
In other words, the form should not be valid if values are mismatched. But
when a form is submitted with mismatched values in a repeated type
`Form::isValid` returns true. No validation error is thrown, and the value
from the repeated field is null. The null value seems to be expected, but
**why is the form a valid submission?**
There is the correct error in `Form::$transformationFailure` but it doesn't
seem to impact the form errors.
Here is a little silex app with a repeated field to illustrate.
If this is expected behavior feel free to close. If that is the case the docs
need some work to clear up expectations about what the repeated type does.
