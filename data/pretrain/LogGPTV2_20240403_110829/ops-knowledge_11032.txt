User: Why does using a CDN in a production environment improve website performance and availability?
Assistant: The use of CDN (Content Delivery Network) can improve the performance and availability of the website for the following reasons: 1. Shorten the network delay: CDN will store the static content of the website (such as pictures, CSS, JS files) on the server closer to the user , so when users visit the website, they can obtain content from nodes closer to them, thereby shortening the network delay time and improving the access speed. 2. Reduce the burden on the origin server: Since CDN can effectively share the traffic of the origin server, it can reduce the burden on the origin server and improve its performance and reliability. 3. Improve the availability of the website: CDN will automatically cache the content of the website on multiple nodes. If a node fails or the network bottlenecks, users can still access the content on other nodes, thereby improving the availability and stability of the website sex. 4. Global distribution, improving access speed: CDN has deployed multiple nodes around the world, so users can obtain content from the nearest node no matter where they are, thus improving access speed. To sum up, CDN can improve the performance and availability of websites, especially for websites with large traffic and global distribution, it is an indispensable tool.
