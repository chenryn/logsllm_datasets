User: I have tried uninstalling it and have searched other answers. None of them have worked; IDLE opens, but I can't run anything I write.
Assistant: IDLE's subprocess didn't make a connection. Either IDLE can't start or a personal firewall software is blocking the connection.
Having had this problem myself I did an uninstall and created a new directory in the C drive and reinstalled in that folder, which worked for me.
