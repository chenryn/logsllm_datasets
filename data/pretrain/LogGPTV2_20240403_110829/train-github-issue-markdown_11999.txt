**Current behavior**  
I have a child aux route:
    const routes = [
      {
        path: 'first', 
        component: FirstComponent, 
        children: [
          {
            path: 'add-groups',
            outlet: 'aside',
            component: AsideComponent
          }
      ]
    ];
Aux component has a close button that works only when parent's params are set
to navigate method like that:
     this.router.navigate([this.route.parent.snapshot.params, {outlets: {aside: null}}]);
and doesn't work like:
     this.router.navigate([{outlets: {aside: null}}]);
**Expected behavior**  
Expect this.router.navigate([{outlets: {aside: null}}]); will close the aux

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Use aux routing
