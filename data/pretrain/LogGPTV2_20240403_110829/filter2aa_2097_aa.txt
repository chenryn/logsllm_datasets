Xprobe/Xprobe2 Project History
 Initial alpha release (Xprobe v0.0.1) at the Blackhat 
briefings USA 2001, June 2001
– Relying on ICMP-based active OS fingerprinting methods
found by Ofir Arkin (specified in the “ICMP Usage In 
Scanning” research paper)
– Static decision tree
– Was not signature-based
– It was only a mission statement - Alpha – limited in 
functionality

Xprobe/Xprobe2 Project History
 Xprobe2 0.1 beta was released last year at Defcon X:
– Based on a signature database
– First open source fingerprinting tool to use fuzzy logic
matching algorithm between probe results to a signature 
database (strict signature matching suffers from a number of 
accuracy issues)
– Xprobe2 0.1 beta was using only ICMP-based fingerprinting 
tests

The Issue with Hardware-based Devices
 When fingerprinting operating systems we fingerprint 
the way an operating system (the software) reacts to 
different fingerprinting probes a tool uses 
 With a hardware based device we fingerprint the way a
device‟s firmware reacts to the different fingerprinting 
probes
 Hardware based devices of the same manufacture will 
usually run the same, or a slightly different, firmware
(or software) version
 It will be either one version for all, or a particular 
version for a particular functionality

The Issue with Hardware-based Devices
 Example: A Cisco 7200 router will be fingerprinted exactly 
the same as Cisco‟s Aironet 1100/1200 wireless access 
points 
 It is not possible to distinguish between different hardware 
based products, and their functionality, manufactured by 
Cisco and using IOS, using traditional active operating 
system fingerprinting methods 
 It is possible to identify these devices as manufactured by 
Cisco and using IOS
 It is also possible to divide these devices into groups 
according to fingerprints differences with the IOS versions
they are using, but not to discover their functionality

11
The Issue with Hardware-based Devices
 Another example is the Foundry Network‟s 
Net/Fast/Big Iron family
 If the designers of the fingerprinting tool of your 
choice failed to understand these issues, the results 
received, which are based on a corrupted database, 
will be unreliable

12
The Way Probe Results Are Being Matched
 A Strict Signature Matching based Tool
– Would search for a 100% match between the received 
results and the tool’s signature database
– If a 100% match is not found, than no match is found and the 
run fails
– Extremely sensitive to environmental affects on the probed 
target, and on the network which the probed target resides 
on

The Way Probe Results Are Being Matched
 Fuzzy Logic
– Xprobe2
 First to implement a statistical analysis based mathematical 
algorithm to provide with a best effort match between probe 
results, received from a targeted system, to a signature 
database 
 Uses one of the simplest forms of Optical Character Recognition 
(OCR), by utilizing a matrix based fingerprints matching based 
on statistical calculation of scores for each test performed
– Using a fuzzy logic approach, provides better resistance 
against environmental affects which might take their toll on a 
target system and on probe packets

14
The Way Probe Results Are Being Matched
 Fuzzy Logic (continue)
– The quality of the results produced with an active operating 
system fingerprinting tool using a fuzzy logic approach would 
be higher
– This is if the tool will not suffer from design flaws, and will 
use a large base of fingerprinting tests
– The fuzzy logic implementation with Xprobe2 still misses the 
ability to assign different weights to different fingerprinting 
tests
– This ability is required since some fingerprinting tests should  
have bigger impact over the overall fingerprinting results

The Use of a Fixed Number of Fingerprinting Tests 
 A fixed number of fingerprinting tests is used
 A fixed number of parameters are examined
 In theory: Possible matches = tests X parameters 
examines X parameters permutations
 Although the overall number of possible matches is 
currently much higher than the number of the current 
available network elements, certain test classes 
cannot deliver the expected results and provide with a 
clear distinction between different network elements

16
The Use of a Fixed Number of Fingerprinting Tests
 A better tool for active OS fingerprinting would be 
required to utilize fingerprinting tests, which would 
examine many parameter values with the probe‟s reply 
 These parameter values would need to be different
among many network elements
 Therefore a number of this kind of tests is required to 
be used in order to achieve a broader distinction 
between different network elements
 It suggests that the usage of more parameter rich
fingerprinting tests with an active operating 
fingerprinting tool will provide better overall results

The Use of a Certain Fingerprinting Niche
 This fixation brings into light the inability of such 
tools to deal with situations where the fingerprinting 
tests they use do not yield an adequate result about a 
certain operating system or even a class of operating 
systems

No Changes Are Made To the TCP/IP Stacks Of New 
Versions Of Operating Systems 
 The behavior of the TCP/IP stack of newly released 
operating systems hardly changes compared to an 
older version of the same operating system, or 
 Changes made to a newly released operating system‟s 
TCP/IP stack might affect a certain protocol behavior 
only
 The result? Inability of some active operating system 
fingerprinting tools to distinguish between different 
versions of the same operating system or even 
between a class of the same operating system family
