## Xprobe/Xprobe2 Project
- **Open Source Project**
- **Developers**:
  - Ofir Arkin
  - Fyodor Yarochkin
  - Meder Kydyraliev
- **Xprobe2**: A remote active operating system fingerprinting tool
- **Alternative to Other Tools**: Voted one of the top 75 security tools (ranked in the top 50)

## Xprobe/Xprobe2 Project History
- **Initial Alpha Release (Xprobe v0.0.1)**: Blackhat Briefings USA 2001, June 2001
  - Relying on ICMP-based active OS fingerprinting methods found by Ofir Arkin (specified in the "ICMP Usage In Scanning" research paper)
  - Static decision tree
  - Not signature-based
  - Limited functionality (mission statement only)
- **Xprobe2 0.1 Beta Release**: Defcon X
  - Based on a signature database
  - First open-source fingerprinting tool to use a fuzzy logic matching algorithm between probe results and a signature database
  - Only ICMP-based fingerprinting tests
- **Xprobe2 0.1 Release (April 2003)**:
  - Sends RFC-compliant packets
  - Numerous bug fixes
  - Support for IP ID = SENT fingerprinting method
  - Major signature database update
  - Documentation on how to add your own signatures

## Issues with Active OS Fingerprinting
### Hardware-Based Devices
- **Fingerprinting Software vs. Firmware**: 
  - When fingerprinting operating systems, we examine how the software reacts to different probes.
  - With hardware-based devices, we fingerprint the firmware's reaction.
  - Devices from the same manufacturer often run the same or slightly different firmware versions.
  - Example: A Cisco 7200 router and Cisco's Aironet 1100/1200 wireless access points will be fingerprinted the same way.
  - It is possible to identify these devices as manufactured by Cisco and using IOS, but not to distinguish their specific functionalities.
  - Another example: Foundry Network's Net/Fast/Big Iron family.
  - If the fingerprinting tool's designers do not understand these issues, the results will be unreliable.

### Matching Probe Results
- **Strict Signature Matching**:
  - Searches for a 100% match between received results and the signature database.
  - Extremely sensitive to environmental effects on the target and the network.
- **Fuzzy Logic (Xprobe2)**:
  - Implements a statistical analysis-based mathematical algorithm for a best-effort match.
  - Uses a matrix-based fingerprint matching based on statistical calculation of scores for each test performed.
  - Provides better resistance against environmental effects.
  - Quality of results is higher if the tool does not have design flaws and uses a large base of fingerprinting tests.
  - Currently lacks the ability to assign different weights to different fingerprinting tests, which is necessary for some tests to have a bigger impact on the overall results.

### Fixed Number of Fingerprinting Tests
- **Current Limitations**:
  - A fixed number of tests and parameters are used.
  - Although the number of possible matches is high, certain test classes cannot provide clear distinctions between different network elements.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - A better tool would need to utilize tests that examine many parameter values in the probe's reply.
  - These parameter values should differ among many network elements.
  - More parameter-rich fingerprinting tests will provide better overall results.

### Fingerprinting Niche
- **Comparison with Nmap**:
  - Nmap primarily focuses on TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
  - Xprobe2 v0.1 uses various ICMP and UDP tests.
- **Limitations**:
  - This fixation limits the ability of such tools to handle situations where the fingerprinting tests do not yield adequate results for certain operating systems or classes of operating systems.

### No Changes in TCP/IP Stacks of New Versions
- **Behavior Consistency**:
  - The behavior of the TCP/IP stack in new operating system versions rarely changes.
  - Changes may affect a specific protocol behavior only.
- **Result**:
  - Some active OS fingerprinting tools cannot distinguish between different versions of the same operating system or even between classes within the same OS family.
