**ATT&CK ID:** T1639.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol

Adversaries may exfiltrate data using unencrypted network protocols that are not part of the established command and control (C2) channel. This method allows them to transfer sensitive information over alternative, less-secure communication channels. Additionally, the exfiltrated data may be sent to a different network location, distinct from the primary C2 server, to evade detection and maintain operational security.
