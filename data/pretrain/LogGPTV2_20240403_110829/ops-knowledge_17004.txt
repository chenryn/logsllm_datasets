User: I'm thinking in create a webapplication with cakephp but consuming python's appengine webservice. But, to install cakephp etc, I need to configure the database. Appengine uses another kind of datastorage, with is different from mysql, etc.
I was thinking in store the data in appengine, and using the python webservices, and with the cakephp application comunicating with the webservice, for insert and retrieve data.
Is there any good resource for this, or is it unpossible.
Obs: also opened for a possibility for developing the webapplicaiton completely in python running in appengine. If anyone has a good resource.
Thanks.
Assistant: You can not run PHP on GAE. If you run PHP somewhere, it is a bad architecture to go over the internet for your data. It will be slooooow and a nightmare to develop in.
You should store your data where you run your php, unless you must have a distributed, globally scaling architecture, which afaiu not the case.
