User:  How to protect the security of the server to avoid cyber attacks and data leakage?
Assistant: The following are some measures to protect server security: 1. Strengthen password strength. Passwords should be sufficiently complex, contain numbers, letters, and special characters, and be changed regularly. 2. Install anti-virus and firewall software, and keep the software updated in a timely manner. 3. Remove useless apps and services. 4. Prohibit unsafe remote access methods (such as telnet), and use secure remote access protocols (such as SSH). 5. Limit user rights on the server and control access to the server. 6. Back up system settings and data regularly to prevent data loss. 7. Regularly conduct security vulnerability scans to discover and repair security vulnerabilities early. 8. Monitor the logs of the server to detect abnormal situations in time. 9. Encrypt sensitive data transmission, such as using SSL or TLS protocols. 10. Establish security policies and specifications, and train employees on security awareness.
