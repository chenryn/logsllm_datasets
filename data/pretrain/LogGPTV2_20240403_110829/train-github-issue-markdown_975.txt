Currently lifetimes has little docs on manual, I found **14 matches for
"lifetime"** on http://static.rust-lang.org/master/doc/rust.html
The borrowed pointers tutorial mentions named lifetimes but doesn't mention
the apostrophe symbol, newcomers might get confused about that.
Same goes for manual, there's no mention to apostrophe, just some examples
using **'static**. It also lacks grammar production.
