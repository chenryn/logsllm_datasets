About This Guide
Use this guide to implement and configure the network management technologies that Junos OS
supports: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Remote Monitoring (RMON), Destination
Class Usage (DCU) and Source Class Usage (SCU) data, and Accounting Profiles. Alarms, events, and
security features are included, as is information on performance management, port mirroring and
analyzers, and system logging.

Device Management Functions in Junos OS
SUMMARY
This section provides an overview of the Junos OS (operating system).
After installing a device into your network, you need to manage the device within your network. Device
management can be divided into five tasks:
• Fault management—Monitor the device; detect and fix faults.
• Configuration management—Configure device attributes.
• Accounting management—Collect statistics for accounting purposes.
• Performance management—Monitor and adjust device performance.
• Security management—Control device access and authenticate users.
The Junos® operating system (Junos OS) network management features work in conjunction with an
operations support system (OSS) to manage the devices within the network. Junos OS can assist you in
performing these management tasks, as described in Table 1 on page 3.

Fault management Monitor and see faults using:
• Operational mode commands—For more information about operational
mode commands, see the CLI Explorer.
• SNMP MIBs—For more information about SNMP MIBs supported by Junos
OS, see the "SNMP MIBs Supported by Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved" on
page 575.
• Standard SNMP traps—For more information about standard SNMP traps,
