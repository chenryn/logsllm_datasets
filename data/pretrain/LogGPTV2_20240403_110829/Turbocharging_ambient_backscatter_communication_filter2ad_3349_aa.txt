ABSTRACT
Communication primitives such as coding and multiple antenna
processing have provided signiﬁcant beneﬁts for traditional wire-
less systems. Existing designs, however, consume signiﬁcant power
and computational resources, and hence cannot be run on low com-
plexity, power constrained backscatter devices. This paper makes
two main contributions: (1) we introduce the ﬁrst multi-antenna
cancellation design that operates on backscatter devices while re-
taining a small form factor and power footprint, (2) we introduce a
novel coding mechanism that enables long range communication as
well as concurrent transmissions and can be decoded on backscat-
ter devices. We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that
can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar
sources. The results show that our designs provide beneﬁts for both
RFID and ambient backscatter systems: they enable RFID tags to
communicate directly with each other at distances of tens of meters
and through multiple walls. They also increase the communication
rate and range achieved by ambient backscatter systems by 100X
and 40X respectively. We believe that this paper represents a sub-
stantial leap in the capabilities of backscatter communication.

INTRODUCTION
The last decade has seen signiﬁcant advances in wireless com-
munication — Wi-Fi systems today can achieve bit rates as high
as 300 Mbps [2] and cellular networks can operate at ranges of
tens of kilometers [3]. These impressive rate and range capabili-
ties have been made possible by communication primitives such
as coding mechanisms and multi-antenna processing. These tech-
niques, however, are not suitable for battery-free devices such as
RFID tags and ambient power harvesting sensors: Existing multi-
antenna designs consume power on the order of a few Watts [14];
this is orders of magnitude more power than is available on harvest-
ing devices [24]. Similarly, coding techniques that enhance commu-

nication range and enable concurrent transmissions (e.g., CDMA)
consume substantial power and computational resources that limit
their applicability to low-power devices.
The key reason for this is that these techniques assume the ability
to perform complex digital signal processing — multi-antenna pro-
cessing requires estimating channel parameters and performing op-
erations such as matrix inversion; coding techniques (e.g., CDMA)
require performing computationally expensive correlation and syn-
chronization. These methods are infeasible on battery-free devices
as obtaining a digital representation of a signal requires power-
intensive ADCs, and performing computationally expensive tasks
is also expensive in terms of power consumption.
In this paper, we ask if it is possible to achieve the beneﬁts of
these communication primitives on battery-free devices. The in-
tuition we leverage is as follows: since the power-intensive na-
ture of these techniques is due to their use of ADCs and digital
computation, if we instead perform computation in the analog do-
main we can achieve orders of magnitude reduction in the power
consumption. Using this as our guiding principle, we design two
communication primitives for backscatter communication: µmo, a
multi-antenna receiver that is powered using harvested energy, and
µcode, a low-power coding mechanism that enables large commu-
nication ranges and concurrent transmissions, and can be decoded
using simple analog components on battery-free devices.
µmo. To understand our low-power multi-antenna design, consider
the ambient backscatter [24] setting in Fig. 2 with two battery-
free devices, Alice and Bob, where Bob communicates with Alice
by backscattering the signals from the TV tower. Existing designs
consider the TV transmissions to be noise, and hence achieve very
low bit rates. Alice, however, can use multiple antennas to separate
Bob’s reﬂections from the direct TV signals, thus achieving sig-
niﬁcantly higher rates. The key challenge however is that conven-
tional multi-antenna decoding hinges on estimating the amplitude
and phase of the channel between the transmitters and the receive
antennas. Since acquiring phase information is power-intensive, it
is not available on backscatter devices [20]. This makes conven-
tional multi-antenna decoding infeasible on backscatter devices.
To address this challenge, we present a multi-antenna technique
that enables Alice’s receiver to decode Bob’s backscattered trans-
mission without estimating the channel parameters. The intuition
bility that is in contrast to conventional RFID systems, where the
RFID tags communicate with the reader but not with each other.
We run experiments in various line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
scenarios at various bit rates from 0.33 bps to 1 Mbps. Our experi-
ments show the following:
• Our µmo prototype consumes 422 µW. In comparison, tradi-
tional Wi-Fi multi-antenna transceivers consume more than one
Watt [14]. µcode, on the other hand, consumes about 8.9 µW.
At an ambient illuminance of 330 lux, we could continuously
power µmo and µcode using a photovoltaic array with an area of
8.28 square inches and 0.17 square inches, respectively. By us-
ing duty-cycling to reduce average power requirements, the pro-
totypes can also operate on energy from ambient TV signals.
• µmo increases ambient backscatter’s data rate by 100X from
10 kbps to 1 Mbps by providing multi-antenna cancellation;
µcode increases ambient backscatter’s range by a factor of 40X
from two feet to more than 80 feet through coding gain. This
signiﬁcantly expands the range of applications where ambient
backscatter can be used.
• µcode enables RFID tags to communicate with each other at dis-
tances of more than 80 feet and between different rooms that
are separated by up to three walls. This reduces the need for de-
ploying RFID readers throughout the environment, which is a
substantial value proposition.
Contributions: We make the following contributions:
• We present µmo, the ﬁrst multi-antenna interference cancella-
tion design that can operate on backscatter devices. To do this,
we introduce a multi-antenna decoding mechanism that does not
require channel estimation and can be achieved using simple ana-
log components.
• We present µcode, a novel coding mechanism that can signiﬁ-
cantly increase the backscatter communication range and can be
decoded on backscatter devices. Using µcode we enable concur-
rent transmissions in a network of battery-free devices.
• Finally, we build hardware prototypes for µmo and µcode and
show that they signiﬁcantly expand the capabilities of backscatter
systems. Speciﬁcally, we provide orders of magnitude increase
in the communication rate and range of ambient backscatter. We
also enable RFID tag-to-tag communication at long ranges and in
through-the-wall scenarios, which was previously not possible.
2. RELATED WORK
Our work is related to prior work in both conventional radio com-
munication and backscatter communication:
(a) Radio Communication: There has been signiﬁcant interest in
multi-antenna systems and coding mechanisms to improve the per-
formance of traditional Wi-Fi and cellular systems [36, 12, 40] .
These techniques, however, require computationally expensive dig-
ital signal processing and power-consuming analog components
(e.g., ADCs). In contrast, our work eliminates the need for ADCs
and digital signal processing, and achieves multi-antenna cancella-
tion and coding gains on backscatter devices.
Our work is also related to low-power MIMO radio designs [38,
8, 34, 18, 22]. These designs increase the energy efﬁciency of
MIMO by optimizing the decoding algorithms [8, 34] and the pro-
cessor designs [18, 22]. They operate in the digital domain, and thus
require power-consuming ADCs. This makes them inapplicable to
backscatter devices.
Prior work on low-power spread spectrum transceivers [25, 19,
26, 9, 11] has attempted to reduce the power consumption of digital
operations such as synchronization and correlation. These systems

code Bob’s backscattered information by separating the direct TV
transmissions from the backscattered signals. µmo achieves this op-
eration with neither channel estimation nor digital computation.
underlying our approach is best explained using an example. Let
s(t) be the signal from the TV tower and suppose Bob conveys ‘1’
(‘0’) bit by reﬂecting (not reﬂecting) the TV signals. Alice now re-
ceives the following signals on its two antennas:
y1(t) = hrf s(t) + hbBs(t)
y2(t) = h′
bBs(t)
rf s(t) + h′

to the two antennas on Alice, respectively. Further, B is 1 when Bob
reﬂects the signals and is 0 otherwise.

performing channel estimation. In §4 we explore the above idea fur-
ther and describe how the above operation can be performed using
simple analog components, without requiring digital computation.
µcode. Coding mechanisms (e.g., CDMA) have been used in con-
ventional radios to signiﬁcantly increase the range of communi-
cation and enable concurrent transmissions. These techniques use
pseudorandom codes to encode information at the transmitter; the
receiver synchronizes with the transmit signal and decodes the in-
formation by correlating with the pseudorandom codes. The chal-
lenge in using these designs is that the correlation and synchroniza-
tion operations are computationally expensive and are difﬁcult to
perform on backscatter devices.
To address this problem, we introduce a low-power coding
scheme for backscatter communication that does not require syn-
chronization. Our intuition is that periodic signals such as sinu-
soidal waves can be detected without the need for synchronization;
thus we design µcode to mimic a sine wave. Speciﬁcally, instead
of using pseudorandom sequences, we use periodic sequences of
alternating zeros and ones as the code. We show that such a design
eliminates the need for synchronization operations at the receiver
while providing large communication ranges. Further, the receiver
can decode using only analog components, thus reducing its power
consumption. Finally, we demonstrate that µcode can also enable
multiple concurrent transmissions in a network of battery-free de-
vices, without the need for synchronization between transmitters.
We build multiple hardware prototypes (one of which is shown
in Fig. 1) that integrate both µmo and µcode in a single system. To
demonstrate the beneﬁts of our designs for backscatter communica-
tion, we build two different prototypes: the ﬁrst prototype enables
ambient backscatter communication using TV transmissions in the
539 MHz frequency range. The second prototype enables RFID tag-
to-tag communication using RFID reader transmissions in the 915
MHz range. Note that tag-to-tag communication is a novel capa-
use traditional radio architectures with power-consuming RF oscil-
lators and ADCs that are not available on a backscatter device. In
contrast, we are the ﬁrst to design and implement CDMA-like codes
on backscatter devices that do not require digital signal processing,
and hence consume orders of magnitude less power.
Finally, our work is related to work in the area of analog sig-
nal processing [30, 32, 33]. Before the advent of digital processors,
wireless communication was performed on analog circuits. Ultra-
wide band communication and radar systems still use analog corre-
lators to reduce the cost of hardware components [30, 31, 21]. We
build on this foundational work but differ from it in that we are the
ﬁrst to apply this principle to achieve multi-antenna cancellation
and channel coding beneﬁts on backscatter devices. Further, we in-
troduce algorithms, techniques, and circuits to achieve this goal.
(b) Backscatter Systems: There has been recent interest in improv-
ing the performance of backscatter communication [41, 6]. Recent
work on ambient backscatter [24] enabled devices to communicate
by backscattering existing RF signals like TV transmissions. How-
ever, current designs are limited to communication ranges of two
feet and communication rates of 10 kbps. Similarly, work on RFID
tag-to-tag communication [28] enabled two RFID tags to communi-
cate with each other in the presence of an RFID reader at distances
of up to 25 mm. Our work signiﬁcantly improves the capabilities
of these systems. Speciﬁcally, using µmo and µcode, we demon-
strate ambient backscatter communication at distances greater than
80 feet and communication rates of 1 Mbps using TV signals. We
also show the feasibility of RFID tag-to-tag communication at dis-
tances of tens of meters, even when multiple walls separate the tags.
Recent work on MIMO RFID systems [15, 35, 23, 29, 4,
10] leverage multi-antenna capabilities to improve the throughput
and reliability of RFID communication. These systems focus on
the communication between a multi-antenna reader and a single-
antenna backscatter device, and thus the computationally inten-
sive and power-consuming MIMO operations are performed on the
powered reader. Recent information theoretic work [13, 16, 17, 7]
characterizes the diversity gains achieved by using multiple anten-
nas on backscatter devices. In contrast, we introduce µmo, a novel
multi-antenna technique that can decode the backscattered informa-
tion by cancelling the interference from ambient signals. We believe
that µmo is the ﬁrst design and implementation of multi-antenna
cancellation on a backscatter device.
Finally, prior work has proposed to use CDMA to address the
problem of collisions in RFID networks [37, 5, 27, 39]. In these
systems a code is assigned to each backscatter device, and the pow-
ered RFID reader correlates with the code to decode the transmitted
data even in the face of collisions. These systems are however de-
signed for uplink communication from the backscatter device to an
RFID reader, and do not enable decoding on a low power backscat-
tering device. In contrast, we present µcode, the ﬁrst coding mech-
anism that provides the beneﬁts of CDMA and can be decoded on
a backscattering device; we also show that µcode can enable con-
current transmissions in a network of battery-free devices.
3. OUR DESIGN PRINCIPLE
Our goal is to design primitives that enhance wireless commu-
nication capabilities on battery-free devices. The key challenge in
achieving this is that wireless primitives such as multi-antenna and
coding use digital signal processing that requires power-intensive
ADCs and computationally expensive digital operations. To address
this challenge, we use the following guiding principle: eliminate the
need for digital processing by enabling computation in the analog
domain. Such an approach, as we show in the rest of the paper, can
provide an order of magnitude reduction in the power consumption
of these communication primitives.
In the rest of this paper, we describe µmo, our low-power multi-
antenna backscatter receiver and show how it can improve the com-
munication rate of ambient backscatter. We then describe µcode,
our low-power coding technique that is achieved using simple ana-
log components, and show how it can be used to increase the com-
munication range of backscatter systems. Finally, we show that our
designs can be used to enable concurrent transmissions in a network
of battery-free devices, without the need for synchronization.
4. µMO
We ﬁrst motivate the need for multi-antenna cancellation in
ambient backscatter systems and then describe the challenges in
achieving µmo. We then describe our receiver design that addresses
these challenges.
4.1 Motivation and Challenges
Multi-antenna designs are known to provide communication rate
gains that are linear with the number of antennas at the receiver;
