User: How to use Prometheus to monitor multiple indicators of the system and display the monitoring results in real time through Grafana charts?
Assistant: The steps for using Prometheus to monitor multiple indicators are as follows: 1. Install and configure Prometheus: choose the appropriate method to install and configure Prometheus according to your system version. 2. Add indicators to be monitored: Add indicators to be monitored in the Prometheus configuration file, for example: ``` scrape_configs: - job_name: 'my_job_name' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: instance: 'my_instance ' ``` Here `my_job_name` specifies the name of the monitoring task, `localhost:9100` specifies the target address and port of monitoring, and `instance` is a custom label that can be used to distinguish different instances. 3. Start Prometheus and view the data source: Start Prometheus and open the http://localhost:9090/targets page to see whether the added data source is available. 4. Use Grafana to display monitoring results: install and configure Grafana, then add a Prometheus data source, create a new Dashboard and create a Panel. Add the indicators to be displayed in the Panel, set the display method and time range, and then view the monitoring results in real time.
