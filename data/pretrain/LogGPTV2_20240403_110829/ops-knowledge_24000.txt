User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to zip the standard output of a process? I have a process that is producing a big amount of log to the standard output in a short period of time. Is there a way to zip the standard output of my process to a file.

I am searching for something like:
./process | zip output.log.zip

Assistant: # your-command | gzip &gt; your.gz
