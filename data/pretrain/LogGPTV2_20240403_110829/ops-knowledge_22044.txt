User: I've installed the azure SDK for Python (pip install azure).
I've copied the Python code on the MS Azure Machine Learning Batch patch for the ML web-service into an Anaconda Notebook.
I've replaced all the place holders in the script with actual values as noted in the scripts comments.
When I run the script I get the error: "NameError: global name 'BlobService' is not defined" at the script line "blob_service = BlobService(account_name=storage_account_name, account_key=storage_account_key)".
Since the "from azure.storage import *" line at the beginning of the script does not generate an error I'm unclear as to what the problem is and don't know how to fix it.  Can anyone point me to what I should correct?
Assistant: James, I figured it out.  I just changed from azure.storage import * to azure.storage.blob import * and it seems to be working.
