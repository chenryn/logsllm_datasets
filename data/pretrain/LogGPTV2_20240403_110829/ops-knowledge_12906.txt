User: How to implement exception handling mechanism in Java application?
Assistant: In Java, the exception handling mechanism can be implemented through the try-catch statement block. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Where an exception may occur in the code, write the code that may throw an exception in the try statement block. 2. Catch the exception that may be thrown in the catch statement block and process it. Different processing can be performed according to the exception type, such as printing an error message, rethrowing an exception, and so on. 3. In the finally statement block, write code that needs to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs, such as closing open files, releasing resources, and so on. Sample code: ``` try { // code that may throw an exception int a = 1/0; } catch (ArithmeticException e) { // catch the exception and print the error message System.out.println("The divisor cannot be 0! "); } finally { // Code that needs to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs ArithmeticException, if an exception occurs, it will be caught by the catch statement block and an error message will be printed. Regardless of whether an exception occurs, the code in the finally statement block will be executed, and the information indicating that the program has been executed is output.
