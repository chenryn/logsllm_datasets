I would love to see a live preview of the changes i make to the configuration,
so i don't have to go to each components page edit in the color via dev tools
and copy them and then paste them into the customizer.  
If a live preview might not be possible, maybe provide a preview button so you
can preview your design without downloading it and tsting it on your own demo
site.
