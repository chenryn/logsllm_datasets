## Expected Behavior
This is a change request.  
In My opinion, it would be helpful if the `color` prop of Typography is set to
`inherit` by default.  
It would also match expectation that when I set a color on a parent component
then all children inherit the color (unless overridden).
Additionally, it would be awesome if this could be done for `Icons` as well.
## Current Behavior
When I am working on a customised design, I am finding myself writing
`color="inherit"` on Many of the `Typography` elements across components.
  1. Create a new Component (I am making a menu) which adds child items recursively (which are different components)
  2. Change Background color and color (text color) of parent component
  3. Child components should have `Typography` elements.
Now even though the color is explicitly defined in parent component, still
typography needs to have a prop.
## Context
Having to specify color prop many times.
