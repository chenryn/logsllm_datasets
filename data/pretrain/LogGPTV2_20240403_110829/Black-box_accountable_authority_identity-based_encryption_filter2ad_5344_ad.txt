Lemma 5. Let  =
poly(λ) and D be an -useful decoder
box. If {Ij}j∈[m] is a dummy attribute set for the user, we
consider the following experiment:

• Select a dummy attribute set {Jj}j∈[m] at random such
that |Ij ∩ Jj|

In particular, the tracing algorithm will implicate the PKG
for all but a negligible fraction of choices of dummy at-
tributes.
We refer the reader to the full version [18] for the proof.
Equipped with this lemma, we continue our proof by contra-
diction. By Lemma 3, the view of the adversary after events
E2 ∧ E3 will be identical for all the remaining (δ/2) − ν3
fraction of rC ’s. Thus, the adversary creates this box inde-
pendent of rC other than the fact that E2∧E3 hold. Because
any of these dummy attribute sets remain equally likely, the
probability that D will succeed is at most

marize this contradiction in the following equations:

Theorem 3. The advantage of an adversary in the Selective-
ID DishonestUser game is negligible for the above A-IBE
scheme under the decisional BDH assumption.
There are similarities between the Selective-ID DishonestUser
game and the selective-set IND-ID-CCA game of Goyal et. al.
[19]. With some critical modiﬁcations, one may adapt the
proof of security in Goyal et. al.
[19] to show a direct re-
duction of the Selective-ID DishonestUser game to the deci-
sional BDH assumption. Instead, we pinpoint these critical
modiﬁcations by giving a reduction from the Selective-ID
DishonestUser game to the selective-set IND-ID-CCA game
of Goyal et. al. [19].
Proof Sketch: Assume towards a contradiction that
there is an adversary A0 which wins the DishonestUser game
with advantage ε. As in Theorem 2, we argue that by the
composition theorem of Canetti [10], there exists an adver-
sary A which has advantage Adv in the OT-Hybrid model
where the oblivious transfer in the key generation is replaced
by an ideal functionality. This new advantage Adv only
diﬀers from ε by a negligible quantity. We use A to play
against a selective-set ABE challenger B. Our construction
was based oﬀ of the Goyal et. al. [19] scheme so there is a
one-to-one correspondence between the parameters in that
scheme and the parameters in our scheme. Thus it makes
sense when we speak of directly passing the parameters from
B to A.
In detail, we consider the universe of attributes to be of
size 2‘ + mn. The 2‘ attributes (A1,0, A1,1, . . . , A‘,0, A‘,1)
will be for the identity and the remaining attributes will
be for the dummy attributes.
In our scheme, a user will
have ‘ attributes corresponding to his identity (i.e. he will
have Ai,IDi if the ith bit of his identity is IDi) and k dummy
attributes for each of the m repetitions. This choice of at-
tributes naturally deﬁnes the associated policy (in the sense
of Goyal et. al. [19] that a ciphertext can be decrypted only
if the identity attributes match and there is at least a τ num-
ber of attributes matching in each of the m repetitions. We
will use this natural correspondence in the key generation
query phase of the DishonestUser game.
i
We now give a reduction from the DishonestUser game to
the selective-set IND-ID-CCA game of Goyal et. al. [19].
Select ID: The adversary A selects an ID∗ as the chal-
lenge. We select the set of attributes corresponding to ID∗
}‘
(namely, {Ai,ID∗
i=1) and a random set of dummy attributes
{J ∗
j }j∈[m] and send the union as the selected set to B. These
will be the attributes used in the challenge ciphertexts in the
selective-set game we are playing with B.
Setup: Then B sends us public parameters, which we pass
on to A.
Key Generation Queries: Because we are now in the
simulation-based model of OT, we know the private inputs in
the key generation protocol and so we can learn the dummy
attribute set. If A queries for a key on ID 6= ID∗ then simply
pass the corresponding user policy as a key query to B which
returns a well-formed key which we pass back to A.
On the other hand if ID = ID∗, since we know the private
inputs, we may select permutations π1 . . . , πm (as per Step
6 in the key generation protocol) in a way such that the key
received by A will not be able to decrypt a ciphertext con-
taining our previously selected attributes. We then query B
for this key and pass it back to A. Note that we must ar-
gue that this deviation from the protocol does not aﬀect A’s
view. But indeed, this is the case because of symmetry: se-
lecting a set of dummy attributes for a ciphertext uniformly
at random then selecting a user’s dummy attribute set that
cannot decrypt this ciphertext uniformly at random induces
the uniform distribution on the user’s dummy attribute set.
Create Decoder Box: A now must output a decryption
key dID∗ and a decoder box D. If A wins the DishonestUser
game then decoder box will implicate the PKG which can
only occur when there is a non-negligible probability that D
decrypts a random ciphertext that cannot be decrypted by
dID∗ . We randomly select two messages M0, M1 and send
them to B which then sends us a challenge ciphertext C
under the previously selected set. If dID∗ can decrypt this
message then we immediately do so and send the correct
guess to B. On the other hand, if dID∗ cannot decrypt then
C can be viewed as a random ciphertext that ID∗ cannot
decrypt, and therefore whenever A wins the DishonestUser
game, D must have a non-negligible advantage in decrypting
the ciphertext.
Thus, we have a non-negligible advantage in the selective-
set game against B. This contradicts the security of the
ABE scheme under the decisional BDH assumption. (cid:4)
5. CONCLUSION AND OPEN PROBLEMS
In this paper, we proposed a model of a secure account-
able authority identity based encryption scheme which han-
dles black-box decoders. This model is a critical improve-
ment over the original Goyal [17] model. We gave a con-
struction of an A-IBE scheme in this enhanced model under
the decisional BDH assumption where the security was re-
spect to the IND-ID-CPA, DishonestPKG, and Selective-ID
DishonestUser games. It may be worth noting that the con-
struction can be viewed as “attachable” to any IBE scheme
by secret sharing the message, so we may achieve better
security or a more eﬃcient underlying scheme as we choose.
There are several interesting open problems to be ex-
plored. We prove our construction to be secure in the Selective-
ID DishonestUser game. This is seemingly due to the under-
lying connection to the Goyal et. al.
[19] scheme which is
only provably select-set secure. Even if there is some inher-
ent diﬃculty in proving the full security of attribute-based
encryption schemes such as Sahai-Waters [23] or Goyal et.
al. [19], there may be other tricks that can be done for our
construction.
Important questions arise when dealing with the users’
decryption keys. The security in both Goyal [17] and our
construction only hold when a one decryption key is gen-
erated per user (with an explicit break if more than one is
made available). This means that if the user loses his key,
the user needs to get a new identity ID0 to request a new
key. Can we make a A-IBE scheme that allows a single ID
to generate polynomially many keys?
Our tracing algorithm takes as input a user’s decryption
key. If a user lost the key or is deliberately uncooperative
in court, then we cannot implicate the PKG or the user.
One interesting open problem is to consider the possibility
of tracing a box using only a public tracing key, or with
the assistance of a tracing authority. What would be the
proper additional modiﬁcations to the model of accountable
authority IBE to account for this?
Finally, we mention the issue of eﬃciency in our scheme.
We view this in terms of the cost of turning an IBE scheme
into an A-IBE scheme by secret sharing the message with our
construction. Each ciphertext and decryption key will now
have an additional ‘ + mk group elements and an additional
mk elements to represent the attributes. In our construc-
tion, there was a single global parameter λ which governed
these parameters (of accountability) as well as the security
of the scheme. One can imagine having a second parameter
γ which will determine the accountability rather than the
security of the scheme which will allow us to adjust the level
of accountability in the scheme. The creation of an A-IBE
scheme with only a logarithmic or constant sized decryption
key and ciphertext remains as a broad open question.

A. AN INSTANTIATION OF THE
PARAMETERS
We give an explicit example of how to choose appropriate
key sizes and threshold sizes for decryption. For simplicity,
we will only focus on one component, i.e. we set j = 1
when looking at Ij in the decryption key and Jj in the
ciphertext. Each of these sets is of size k which we choose
to be a ﬁxed constant fraction of n. For example, we may
5 · n. From this, we can determine the expected

number of dummy attributes in their intersection: 3
By Chernoﬀ bounds, it can be seen that the probability
25 · n
that this intersection falls below a constant fraction of 9
will be negligible in n. Thus if we set our threshold to be
25 ·n then a random ciphertext can be decrypted by the user
