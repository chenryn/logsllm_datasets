User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Unlink Windows 8 MS Account I am the IT administrator for a few branch offices, and am seeing more and more of our staff "accidentally" linking their account to a MS account. I did some searching on here and found out how to remove the ability to link to an MS account (What features of Windows 8/8.1 Pro will not work without a Microsoft Account?), but I am still not able to remove the link from their account if they leave the organization as part of the equipment return process.

How can I remove their account from being linked to an MS account if I cannot change their account password and login as them? I don't see the option in the Control Panel or PC Settings, even when logged in as an Administrator.

Assistant: The only way to get rid of a Microsoft account without logging into it, is to delete it. Currently, it seems you can't unlink an account without being logged as that user.

So, once you are logged as an Administrator on the machine, backup all the files of that account, delete the user account.
Some leftover files will still be in C:\Users\&lt;MicrofotUserAccount&gt;



Additionally, you can forbid the possibility to link an account to a Microsoft account via GPO

  This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts
  on a computer. If you click the Users can’t add Microsoft accounts
  setting option, users will not be able to create new Microsoft
  accounts on a computer, switch a local account to a Microsoft account,
  or connect a domain account to a Microsoft account. This is the
  preferred option if you need to limit the use of Microsoft accounts in
  your enterprise. If you click the Users can’t add or log on with
  Microsoft accounts setting option, existing Microsoft account users
  will not be able to log on to Windows. Selecting this option might
  make it impossible for an existing administrator to log on to a
  computer and manage the system. If you disable or do not configure
  this policy (recommended), users will be able to use Microsoft
  accounts with Windows.
