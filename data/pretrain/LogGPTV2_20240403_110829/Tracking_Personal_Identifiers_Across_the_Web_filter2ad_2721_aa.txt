## Abstract
User tracking has become a de facto practice on the web, yet our understanding of its scale and nature remains limited. This paper explores the connections among all parties involved in the web, with a focus on how trackers share user identifiers (IDs). Using data from the browsing histories of 129 users and active experiments, we identify user-specific IDs that are likely used for tracking. Our findings reveal significant ID-sharing practices across different organizations providing various services. Notably, ID-sharing occurs on a large scale, regardless of the user's profile size or whether they are logged in or out. Surprisingly, we observed a higher number of ID-sharing domains when users were logged out. This work highlights the substantial gap between our current knowledge of user tracking and the actual practices within this complex and important ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing use of personal data and sophisticated algorithms to track and analyze online behavior has led to a proliferation of tracking services. These services, including third-party advertising and analytics, build user profiles by collecting, aggregating, and correlating individual browsing behavior, demographics, and interests. While these services are essential for the online economy, they raise significant privacy concerns, such as the misuse of ad tracker cookies to identify individuals.

These services are not only growing in number but also evolving in terms of mechanisms and technologies. Examples include the emergence of Flash cookies, ETags re-spawning, and canvas fingerprinting. One underexplored aspect of the web ecosystem is the sharing of user-specific identifiers (IDs). Although some studies have highlighted this practice, our understanding of its extent and the nature of the parties involved remains rudimentary.

In this paper, we explore the characteristics of user ID-sharing groups by analyzing the organizational and categorical relationships among the members of these groups. We then investigate the effect of user profile on the presence of ID-sharing groups, showing that users are tracked regardless of their profile size or condition (logged-in or logged-out). After discussing related work, we provide our conclusions.

## 2. User Tracking
### 2.1 Methodology and Data Collection
We extended the Lightbeam Firefox plug-in to log all headers of HTTP requests and responses, and to record the country where the user is located. The recorded data is automatically sent to our server using an encrypted connection. We chose Lightbeam due to its interactive and easily understandable user interface. We asked colleagues and friends to install our plug-in and use Firefox as their primary browser for at least two weeks. To preserve users' privacy, we did not record any identifiable information such as IP addresses, names, or contact details. Additionally, we obtained ethics approval from the QMUL ethics committee (code QMREC1416a) before conducting our user studies. All data were collected between February 20, 2015, and April 1, 2015. In total, we had 129 participants from 22 countries, who visited 4,951 unique websites, including 6,568 unique third-party trackers.

### 2.2 Nature of ID-Sharing Groups
To explore user tracking via ID-sharing, we first determined the identifiers likely used as user-specific IDs. We applied the following rules inspired by Acar et al. [6] on all items stored in cookies and URL parameters:

1. Extract (key, value) pairs using delimiters such as ampersand (&) and semicolon (;).
2. Exclude inconsistent (key, value) pairs (i.e., multiple values for the same key from a single domain).
3. Exclude value strings shared by multiple users.
4. Include only value strings longer than 7 characters.

Applying these rules, we found that 96% of user-specific IDs have a minimum length of 7 characters. We identified 3,224 unique user IDs from 806 domains, with 96% of these IDs being shared between at least two domains. This allowed us to identify 660 unique ID-sharing groups, each containing two to more than eight domains. Figure 2a shows the distribution of these groups based on the number of domains, while Figure 2b shows the distribution based on the number of organizations.

### 2.3 Organizational and Categorical Sharing
To understand the organizational structure behind ID-sharing, we broadened our approach from domains to organizations. For example, the organizational sharing group for {google.com, youtube.com} is {Google}. We used a combination of methods, including Collusion’s dataset, email addresses from SOA records, and whois records, to identify the organizations behind the domains.

Figure 2b shows the distribution of organizational sharing groups. We observed that within-organizational sharing is less common than cross-organizational sharing, with the majority of cross-organizational sharing occurring between two organizations. Table 3 lists the top 15 most popular organizational sharing groups and the nature of their ID-sharing.

To gain further insight, we analyzed the categories of domains in each group using the Trend Micro Site Safety Center categorization service. We found that categories related to the ad ecosystem (e.g., ad networks, analytics, ad exchanges) have the highest presence, as expected. Table 4 shows the top 15 categories of the sharing groups and the nature of their domain categories. Most ID-sharing occurs across different categories, raising privacy concerns, especially when sensitive categories like health-related websites are involved.

## 3. Effect of User Profile
In the previous section, we observed strong ID-sharing based on two-weeks of online activity logs from over 100 users. Here, we further examine the potential intentions behind ID-sharing by studying the effect of user profile on the presence of ID-sharing domains. We created five artificial users with separate accounts on Google, Amazon, eBay, and Twitter, assigning them three different profile sizes: Proﬁle-500 (top 500 Alexa sites), Proﬁle-200 (top 200 Alexa sites), and Proﬁle-0 (empty browsing history). We also considered a user with no account (noAccount).

We created the browsing history by crawling the corresponding Alexa list of websites for five consecutive times while users were logged in. After creating the user profiles, we installed the Firefox extension from Section 2.1 and visited Alexa’s top 1,000 websites for each user, repeating this for 20 iterations. We performed the main step under two conditions: user logged in and user logged out.

Applying the same rules as in Section 2.2, we identified 4,104 unique user-specific IDs shared by 787 domains. Figure 3 illustrates the accumulated number of unique ID-sharing domains across iterations per user and profile condition. The highest increase occurred between the first and second iteration (approximately 40%), with subsequent iterations showing smaller increases.

Table 5 shows a sample HTTP request from webmd.com (a health information website) to gravity.com (an advertisement tracker). Gravity.com logs users’ visited pages via the referrer URL parameter, exposing searched terms to the tracker, which raises serious privacy concerns.
