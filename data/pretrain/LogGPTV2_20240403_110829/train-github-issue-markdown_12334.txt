 **Apache Airflow version** : 1.10.15
**Kubernetes version (if you are using kubernetes)** (use `kubectl version`):
**Environment** :
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Redhat 8.3
**What happened** :
Installed airflow with pip, it picked up sql alchemy 1.4.6 as a dependency.
This causes airflow to fil to run as flask-admin 1.5.4 is not compatible with
sqlalchemy 1.4. flask-admin 1.5.6 is however.

**What you expected to happen** :
setup.py has a dependency on sqlalchemy=~1.3 so should not pull 1.4
**How to reproduce it** :
pip install "apache-airflow < 2.0"  
airflow version
the pip install log shows:

How often does this problem occur? Once? Every time etc?
Every time.
