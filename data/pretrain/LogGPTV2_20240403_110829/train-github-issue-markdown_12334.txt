### Issue Report: Apache Airflow Installation Failure

**Apache Airflow Version**: 1.10.15  
**Kubernetes Version (if applicable)**: N/A  
**Environment**:
- **Operating System**: Red Hat 8.3

#### What Happened
After installing Apache Airflow using `pip`, the installation process picked up SQLAlchemy 1.4.6 as a dependency. This version of SQLAlchemy is not compatible with Flask-Admin 1.5.4, which is required by Airflow. Specifically, Flask-Admin 1.5.4 is incompatible with SQLAlchemy 1.4, whereas Flask-Admin 1.5.6 is compatible.

The error trace is as follows:

```python

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy.ext.declarative.clsregistry'
```

#### Expected Behavior
The `setup.py` file for Airflow specifies a dependency on `sqlalchemy~=1.3`, so the installation should not pull in SQLAlchemy 1.4.6.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the following command to install Airflow:
   ```sh
   pip install "apache-airflow < 2.0"
   ```
2. Verify the installed version:
   ```sh
   airflow version
   ```

The `pip` installation log shows that it is downloading and installing SQLAlchemy 1.4.6 instead of the expected version:

```sh
Collecting sqlalchemy~=1.3
  Downloading SQLAlchemy-1.4.6-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (1.5 MB)
```

#### Frequency of the Problem
This issue occurs every time the installation is attempted.
