Daniel J. Weitzner 
CSAIL Decentralized Information Group,  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Daniel Weitzner is Co-Director of the MIT CSAIL Decentralized Information Group, teaches 
Internet public policy in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, and is 
Policy  Director  of  the  World  Wide  Web  Consortium’s  Technology  and  Society  activities.  At 
DIG,  he  leads  research  on  the  development  of  new  technology  and  public  policy  models  for 
addressing legal challenges raised by the Web, including privacy, intellectual property, identity 
management,  and  new  regulatory  models  for  the  Web.  At  W3C,  he  is  responsible  for  Web 
standards  needed  to  address  public  policy  requirements,  including  the  Platform  for  Privacy 
Preference  (P3P)  and  XML  Security  technologies.  He  was  the  first  to  advocate  user  control 
technologies  such  as  content  filtering  to  protect  children  and  avoid  government  censorship. 
These arguments played a critical role in the landmark Internet freedom of expression case in the 
United  States  Supreme  Court,  Reno  v.  ACLU  (1997).  In  1994,  his  advocacy  work  won  legal 
protections  for  e-mail  and  Web  logs  in  the  US  Electronic  Communications  Privacy  Act. 
Weitzner was co-founder and Deputy Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, and 
Deputy  Policy  Director  of  the  Electronic  Frontier  Foundation.  He  serves  on  the  Boards  of 
Directors of the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Software Freedom Law Center, and 
the Internet Education Foundation. Weitzner has a law degree from Buffalo Law School, and a 
B.A. in Philosophy from Swarthmore College. His writings have appeared in Science magazine, 
the Yale Law Review, Communications of the ACM, Computerworld, Wired Magazine, Social 
Research,  Electronic  Networking:  Research,  Applications  &  Policy,  and  The  Whole  Earth 
Review.

Throughout the history of computer and network security research, privacy has been treated as 
synonymous  with  confidentiality,  with  the  presumed  high  water  mark  of  privacy  being 
mathematically provable anonymity. Despite the fact that technical innovation in cryptography 
and  network  security  has  enabled  all  manner  of  confidentiality  control  over  the  exposure  of 
identity in information systems, the vast majority of Internet user remain deeply worried about 
their privacy rights and correctly believe that they are far more exposed today than they might 
have been a generation earlier. Have we just failed to deploy the proper security technology to 
protect privacy,  are our laws  inadequate to meet present day  privacy  threats,  or  have  business  
practices and social conventions simply rendered privacy dead? While there is some truth to each 
possibility, the central failure to achieve robust privacy in the information age can be traced to an 
a  long-standing  misassocation  of  privacy  with  confidentiality  and  access  control.    In  order  to 
revitalize  privacy  protection,  we  should  shift  our  legal  attention  away  from  rules  limiting 
disclosure of personal information toward policies governing how personal information can be 
used.  And  technical  efforts  currently  focused  on  access  control  and  anonymization  should  be 
redirected  toward  technical  measures  that  make  information  usage  more  transparent  and 
accountable  to  clearly  stated  policies  that  address  proper  and  improper  users  of  personal 
information.
