User: Please provide a database optimization plan, including how to choose an appropriate index, how to optimize query statements, etc.
Assistant: Database optimization plan: 1. Index optimization: Select the appropriate index type: primary key index, unique index, common index, full-text index, etc., and optimize the index for the fields of the data table according to the business scenario and data characteristics. Build a joint index: If there are multiple fields in the data table that need to be queried or used as query conditions, you can consider building a joint index. The joint index can greatly improve the performance of the query. 2. SQL optimization: Avoid using SELECT * to query only required fields, avoid SELECT *, select only required fields, reduce the overhead of reading data from the database, and improve query efficiency. Avoid using LIKE '%xxx%', LIKE '%xxx', LIKE 'xxx%', full table scan will be very slow, consider using full-text index or other methods to optimize. Avoid using a large number of subqueries and multi-layer nested queries, and consider combining subqueries and outer queries for optimization. Use inner joins as much as possible and use less outer joins. Inner joins can avoid the generation of Cartesian products and improve query efficiency. 3. Table design optimization: Table design should conform to the paradigm, reduce data redundancy, reduce IO operations of data tables, and improve query efficiency. Sub-databases and sub-tables disperse the amount of data, concurrent read and write access, and improve the concurrent performance of database access. Use caching technology to cache data in memory, reduce IO operations, and greatly improve query efficiency. 4. Vertical splitting: Split different data tables into different databases to reduce query pressure and improve query efficiency. 5. Horizontal splitting: Split the data in the same data table into different databases according to a certain condition to improve query efficiency. 6. Hardware optimization: Improve the hardware configuration, including CPU, memory, hard disk, etc. At the same time, the speed of data reading and writing can be improved through technologies such as RAID technology and SSD hard disk. 7. Data cleaning: timely delete data that is no longer used, reduce the pressure on the data table, and improve query efficiency. The above are some basic ideas and methods for database optimization solutions, which need to be selected and implemented according to specific business scenarios and data characteristics.
