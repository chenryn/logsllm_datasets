User: I am trying to port my linux network automation to a set of Windows machines.  The program I have starts with a single admin console, and transmits instructions over sockets and ssh tunnels to client machines instructing them to run specific mozmill/python scripts.  I have gotten the individual client script to run on windows using cygwin, but I need to be able to call them from an ssh session, and ssh-ing in through Cygwin's sshd distribution logs me in with a basic Bash terminal instead of the Cygwin terminal.  How can I switch which terminal is used in this situation?
Assistant: Got it. The solution is simply to run the Cygwin.bat from the c:\cygwin folder, which puts you into a cygwin terminal, allowing the use of all of the needed functionality. The same also works for the mozilla-build terminal that I neeeded. :-D
