Kahneman and Beatty [19]. More recently, several studies have 
showed an association between the increase of the pupil size and 
the increase of  mental activity  [17,  21] to  various  sources of 
psychological stress (e.g. [20]). 
The  analysis of  the  spectral  content of the  pupil  diameter 
(PD)  signal  and its  association  with  the  increase  of  cognitive 
demanding tasks also drew researchers attention since LÃ¼dtke 
and  its  colleagues  [22]  quantified,  in  the  frequency  domain, 
pupillary fatigue waves (below 0.8 Hz) neglecting fast pupillary 
changes  (>  1.5625  Hz),  to  measure  sleepiness.  Since  then, 
spectral analysis of PD data is commonly applied to the analysis 
of pupillary diameter fluctuations. More particularly, Nakayama 
and Shimizu [23] found an increase of the spectral density of PD 
signals within frequency bands of 0.1â€“0.5 Hz and 1.6â€“3.5 Hz as 
a function of cognitive task difficulty, during calculation tasks.  
Other interesting research focused on the ratio between the 
low  (LF)  and  high  frequency  (HF)  bands  of  the  PD  signal 
spectra.  Murata and  Iwase  [24] associated increase of LF/HF 
ratio with mental workload (in mental arithmetic and Sternberg 
short-term memory tasks). Here, the LF band was defined from 
0.05 and 0.15 Hz, while the HF band between 0.3 and 0.5 Hz.

Peysakhovich et al. [25] showed evidence that the LF/HF ratio 
(LF - 0â€“1.6 Hz â€“ and HF - 1.6â€“4 Hz) of the PD power spectral 
densities are sensitive to the cognitive load but not to luminance 
changes. 
III. EXPERIMENT DESIGN AND PROTOCOL 
an  observational 
The  goal  of  our  experiments  is  to  prove  that  the  distinct 
levels of mental effort experienced in code comprehension (e.g., 
during software inspections) can be captured by manifestations 
of the autonomic  nervous  system (ANS)  activity.  In  order to 
assess sympathetic and parasympathetic activity imbalances of 
the  ANS  induced  by  mental  effort  during  reading  and 
understanding  of  code  of  distinct  complexity  we  have 
implemented 
study  using  different 
technologies  of  low  intrusive/wearable  sensors  that  could 
potentially be applied in producing contexts of software code 
inspections. The set of sensors selected were the ECG, EDA, and 
eye tracking with pupillography. ECG and EDA  signals were 
collected using BiosignalsPlux from Plux and the pupil diameter 
(among other variables) was collected using an SMI eye tracker. 
These were captured using a common time base in order to allow 
cross  analysis  as  well  as 
to  explore  complementary 
manifestations of the ANS. In this paper we will focus only on 
the analysis of the variability of the pupil diameter.   
study 
The  observational 
included  30  experienced 
programmers (male: 24, female: 6, age: 24.4 Â± 6.18 yrs) in Java 
programming language. The volunteers were selected using an 
interview-based  screening  process,  which  enabled  us  to 
categorize  each  participant  as  Intermediate  (12  participants), 
Advanced (14  participants)  or Expert  (4 participants) in Java 
programming.  Participants  have  been  informed  about  the 
purpose of the experiment. In particular, they have been told that 
they are not under evaluation in any way, to reduce the effect of 
being "watched". In any case, the way pupilography features are 
extracted  is  essentially  differential  (i.e.  in  comparison  with 
baseline activities such as reading a text or doing nothing during 
30 seconds), so the effect of being "watched" is not significant. 
The data collection campaign received ethical clearance by 
the  Universityâ€™s  Ethical  Commission,  in  accordance  with  the 
Declaration  of  Helsinki,  and  all  participants  provided  written 
informed consent. An open data philosophy is followed in this 
project. Hence, the anonymized data from this research will be 
available upon request to the authors. 
The designed protocol involved code inspection of 3 small 
Java  programs,  herein  identified  by  C1,  C2  and  C3,  with 
different  complexities.  Special  care  was  taken  during  the 
program development phase in order to maintain consistency in 
the  programming  style and to avoid added  difficulty,  such as 
math  or  algorithm,  not  directly  attributable  to  the  code 
complexity.    In  order  to  achieve  these  goals,  in  C1  a  simple 
program  was  implemented  that  counts  the  number  of  values 
existing in a given array that fall within a given interval using a 
straightforward loop. Program C2 translates the multiplication 
of  two  numbers  using  the  basic  algorithm  for  arithmetic 
multiplication.  First  the  program  converts  the  string  input 
parameters 
straightforward 
multiplication  is  implemented  where  every  digit  from  one 
number is multiplied by every digit from the other number, from 
right  to  left.  Finally,  for  program  C3  a  search  problem  was 
into  byte  arrays.  Next,  a 
640
implemented where the largest occurrence of an integer cubic 
array  inside  a  larger  cubic  array  is  searched.  This  problem 
exhibits many nested loops and, therefore, has a high cyclomatic 
complexity. Table I summarizes the complexity metrics of the 
three programs. It should be mentioned that in C1 and C3 the 
algorithm is coded in one function, whereas C2 is spread across 
two functions. In spite of C2 and C3 having a similar number of 
code lines, C2 might be easier to read and understand than C3.

Throughout the experiment similar condition were applied

without distractions, noise or the presence of people unrelated to 
the experiments. The main steps of the protocol, performed on 
the screen of a laptop, are: 
1.A baseline was captured by exhibiting an empty grey screen 
with a black cross in its center for 30 seconds. 
2.A simple reference activity for the purpose of data analysis 
was captured using a text in natural language to be read by 
the participant (60 seconds max.).  
3.Empty grey screen with a black cross for 30 seconds. 
4.Screen  displays  the  code  in  Java  of  the  program  to  be

5.Empty grey screen with a black cross for 30 seconds. 
6.Survey 1: NASA-TLX to assess the subjective mental effort

This protocol is repeated 3 times for each participant. In each 
iteration, a different program (C1, C2, C3) is used in step 4. 
IV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS PROCEDURE 
In the present study we aim to evaluate the changes of the 
pupil diameter (PD) during the analysis of code using different 
frequency domains. It has been reported that the power spectrum 
density of pupil signals increases within certain band intervals 
as a function of cognitive task difficulty [23]. Therefore, since 
these frequency bands are not well established in the literature, 
our study also investigates how the spectral components change 
when  performing  tasks  (i.e.,  analyzing  code  snippets)  with 
different complexities.  
To perform this analysis, the PD signal from the left eye was 
first  pre-processed  (removal  of  blink  related  artifacts  and 
outliers,  resampling  and  reconstructing  intervals  of  missing 
data) and estimation of the spectral content of the PD in a time-
variant fashion.

A. Pre-processing 
First, all intervals labeled by the eye tracker as having invalid 
pupil diameter (PD) values (Î”inv), due to blink events or other 
external factors were considered as inaccurate. Additionally, it 
was observed that in the vicinity of these intervals Î”inv the PD 
values  were  questionably  larger.  In  order  to  exclude  these 
artifacts, the intervals adjacent to Î”inv, 100 ms before Î”inv onset 
and 100 ms after Î”inv offset were also considered as inaccurate 
(i.e.(-Î”  " 	

Second, spurious values in the pupil diameter signal that do 
not 
(e.g. 
disproportionately large dilation speeds and abnormally large 
deviations  from  the  trend  line),    were  also  considered  as 
inaccurate  values.  To  detect  these,  an  outlier  detection 
algorithm based on the boxplot analysis [26] was adopted. The 
pupil diameter  signal  was  differentiated ()  and  the  lower 
quartile  (Q1:  25th  percentile),  the  upper  quartile  (Q3:  75th 
percentile) and the interquartile range ( $  " 
) were 
identified. The PD value at the instant t is considered as outliers

 All the identified outliers are considered as abnormal values 
and therefore belonging to .  
Finally,  the  identified  inaccurate  values  were  interpolated 
using a shape-preserving piecewise cubic interpolation and the 
resulting PD signal was down sampled to 20 Hz, reducing the 
data size considerably while preserving the frequency contents 
to be studied, from 0 to 10 Hz.  
1) Reconstruction of the PD signal 
Artifacts related to eye blinks and other external factors are 
well known to have a great impact in the analysis  of the  PD 
signals, both in the time and frequency domains [23]. In order to 
reduce the influence of these factors in the current analysis, we 
used an algorithm for filling in missing data based on Singular 
Spectrum Analysis (iterative SSA) [27, 28, 29]. The basis of this 
algorithm is to decompose the original time series into a sum of 
components with meaningful interpretation (trends, oscillatory 
modes or noise) and reconstruct the intervals with missing data 
using an arbitrary number of components in an iterative fashion. 
Using only temporal correlations present in the time series, the 
reconstructed  time  series  in  the  intervals  corresponding  to 
missing data present produce better estimates of the missing data 
when compared to an average or an interpolation, an essential 
element when considering analysis in the frequency domain. 
2) High pass filtering 
Prior to the analysis in the frequency domain, the PD time 
series was high-pass filtered with a very low cutoff frequency 
(
 # 
	 Hz) in order to minimize the effects of medium-term 
nonstationary within the time interval under analysis [30].  
B. Time-variant frequency analysis 
To  investigate  the  influence  of  the  sympathetic  and 
parasympathetic  activity  in  the  pupil  diameter  we  used  an 
approach  similar  to  the  classic  heart  rate  variability  (HRV) 
analysis [31], as we are interested in the variability of the pupil.  
641
A sliding window of 30 sec shifted by increments of 1 sec 
was used to decompose in consecutive subsets of the time series. 
For  each  subset,  the  estimation  of  the  spectral  contents  was 
performed  using  a  parametric  spectral  analysis  via  the
