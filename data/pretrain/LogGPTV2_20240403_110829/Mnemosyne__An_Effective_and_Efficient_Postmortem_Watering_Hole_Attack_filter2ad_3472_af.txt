8.1 Hyperparameter Optimization
The 𝜔 controls the duration of the profiling phase, which is required to learn 𝐷𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑙𝑒.
The proper setting of 𝜔 varies between websites, and we found that the complexity
of the website and number of distinct URLs visited on the website played the largest
role in determining how to set 𝜔. To determine a reasonable value to set 𝜔 for a
website, we completed an experiment that determined the number of distinct URLs
required to visit in order to learn the profiling version for a website. To complete this
evaluation, we relied on a subset of the Categories dataset that included 548 websites.
This subset was chosen, since these sites generated a single domain version during
the data collection period. Next, we measured the minimal number of distinct URL
visits required to build the profiling domain version for each website category. We
found that, on average, the number was relatively low, only requiring 45 distinct URLs.
Therefore, the forensic analyst should set the value of 𝜔 to the average number of
days necessary to observe 45 distinct URLs. We provided a detailed description of the
number of distinct URLs required to visited for each category in Table 10
