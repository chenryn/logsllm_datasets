Question: "An Android developer is designing a key management scheme that includes several constraints: the keys must have a device-unique identifier, there should be a limit on the number of uses per boot, and the keys need to support a specific minimum MAC length. Which combination of Android Keymaster tags would best fit these requirements?"
 "A": "Tag::UNIQUE_ID, Tag::MAX_USES_PER_BOOT, Tag::MIN_MAC_LENGTH"
 "B": "Tag::NONCE, Tag::MIN_SECONDS_BETWEEN_OPS, Tag::MAC_LENGTH"
 "C": "Tag::ORIGIN, Tag::OS_VERSION, Tag::PADDING"
 "D": "Tag::KEY_SIZE, Tag::OS_PATCHLEVEL, Tag::NO_AUTH_REQUIRED"
Answer: A
