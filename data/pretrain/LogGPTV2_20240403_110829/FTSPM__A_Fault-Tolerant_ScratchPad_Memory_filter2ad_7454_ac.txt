predeÔ¨Åned percentage of overhead from the ideal
situation), a data block with the least vulnerability
is removed from STT-RAM region and then this step
will be re-executed. The process is then repeated until
satisfying the performance constraint.
The energy overhead of the current SPM allocation
scenario is calculated. If the energy overhead exceeds
its predeÔ¨Åned threshold, a data block with the least
vulnerability is removed from the STT-RAM region.
This step will be re-executed until satisfying the
energy requirement.
To satisfy the endurance of the STT-RAM region, the
number of writes to each STT-RAM-allocated data
block is calculated and all the blocks with write-
cycles greater than STT-RAM write threshold are
removed from the STT-RAM region, regardless of
their vulnerability.
After satisfying performance, energy, and endurance
thresholds in the previous steps, the blocks that have
been removed from the STT-RAM region would
be assigned to the SEC-DED protected or parity
protected region of SRAM. This is done based on
blocks vulnerability and size limitations.
After specifying the SPM region of each data block, the
sequence of blocks accesses will be extracted from the static
proÔ¨Åling information. Based on this sequence, the exact SPM
address of each block and the sequence of blocks transfer,
i.e., the exact point of mapping and un-mapping of blocks
during application execution will be generated. In the next
step, instructions that transfer program blocks between off-
chip memory and SPM are inserted in proper lines of the code
to transfer the blocks at run-time.
IV. MOTIVATIONAL EXAMPLE
In this section,
the efÔ¨Åciency of the FTSPM mapping
algorithm and the corresponding mapping tool is veriÔ¨Åed by
considering a case study example. For this purpose, the pseudo
code presented in Algorithm 2 is executed on the simulation
platform. This program contains two multiply functions, two
add functions, and a quick sort library function using four
arrays as their inputs. The size of each array is about 2 KB.
The SPM conÔ¨Åguration of the platform used in this ex-
periment consists of a 16 KB instruction SPM and a 16 KB
data SPM. Data SPM constitutes of a 2 KB ECC protected
SRAM region, a 2 KB parity protected SRAM region, and
a 12 KB STT-RAM region which is completely immune
against radiation-induced soft errors; the instruction SPM is
completely implemented by STT-RAM cells.
After executing the considered program on the simulation
platform, the information shown in Table I is retrieved by
means of application proÔ¨Åling. As it is shown, the programs are
separated into 8 different blocks, which consists of data blocks
and instruction blocks. Based on this proÔ¨Åling, the information
which is necessary for the second phase is achieved.
After completing the proÔ¨Åling phase, the MDA algorithm
is called. Based on the information extracted from proÔ¨Åling
phase, in this algorithm, the proper place of each block in
the proposed hybrid structure is determined. Among all of the
program blocks in Table I, the Main block could not be mapped
to the instruction SPM because of the size limitation in the 16
KB instruction SPM. The Add and the Mul blocks will be
mapped to instruction SPM since their sizes are small enough
to be mapped to the instruction SPM and no writing operation
is done in these blocks. So they do not limit the endurance
of STT-RAM cells. It should be noted that the primary write
operations which are done during coping of these blocks from
the main memory to SPM, have not been considered in the

the proposed method, the execution of the new code is also
proÔ¨Åled.
The primary information to validate the results of mapping
scenario is the manner of blocks distribution across the hybrid
structure. In Fig. 2, the distribution of read and write operations
for the case study program has been shown. The reported
percentages for the ECC and parity regions have been cal-
culated based on the total read and write operations occurring
alongside the SRAM cells.
Indeed, the hybrid structure affects the primary properties
of the SPM, e.g., Reliability, Performance, Energy Consump-
tion, and Endurance. In the following, we explain how the
reliability of the proposed method has been calculated.
Based on different vulnerabilities among the regions of the
hybrid SPM structure, the equation used for calculating the
reliability should be aware of two fundamental parameters.
The Ô¨Årst one is the percentage of references to each region of
the hybrid SPM or distribution pattern of the program blocks
across the SPM; the second parameter is the vulnerability of
each region against radiation-induced soft errors.
Errors in a system can be categorized in the following three
types [6]:
‚àô
‚àô
‚àô
Silent Data Corruption (SDC): In this error type, the
appearance of the errors is not detected in the target
system.
Detectable Un-recoverable Error (DUE): This cate-
gory refers to the errors detected by the protection
techniques, but the corrupted data cannot be recovered.
Detectable Recoverable Error (DRE): This category
refers to the errors that can be detected and recovered
by the protection techniques.
The conventional parity protection technique can detect
single bit error and the conventional ECC, i.e. SEC-DED, is
capable of detecting two bits error or correcting single bit error.
Thus, the major challenge in determining the reliability of the
proposed method is to calculate the probability distribution of
the one or multi-bit errors caused by particle strikes.
The rate of bit-Ô¨Çips in different technology node has been
reported in [6]. According to this study, if it is assumed that
a radiation-induced soft error has occurred alongside the 40-
nm technology size, the probabilities of one, two, three, and
more than three bit-Ô¨Çips are about 62%, 25%, 6%, and 7%,
respectively.
Based on the above information and the Architectural
Vulnerability Factor (AVF) [24], the reliability of the proposed
Fig. 2. Distribution of read/write operations across the FTSPM structure
Table I, as these operations are performed just once before the
Ô¨Årst running of the blocks .
The blocks of Array1, Array3, and Stack are removed from
the STT-RAM part of data SPM, because of their intensive
write operation which violates the write threshold on the STT-
RAM region. Array3 and Array4 blocks can be mapped to the
STT-RAM region of data SPM. Among the blocks which have
been removed from the STT-RAM region, the Stack block is
mapped to the parity part of data SPM based on its vulnerabil-
ity to radiation-induced soft errors. Array1 and Array3 blocks
are also mapped to the ECC region of data SPM.
The developed proÔ¨Åler tool used in this experiment also
reports the number of stack calls during each reference to an
instruction block and its required stack size during that refer-
ence. This helps the MDA Algorithm to map instruction blocks
with their desirable stack area, whenever those instruction
blocks are mapped to the instruction SPM. Another important
factor reported after proÔ¨Åling is the life-time of the blocks.
The lifetime of a block is the total duration of time periods
across the program execution, which is started by referring that
block and ended by the Ô¨Årst reference to the other blocks by
the program counter. The output of the MDA Algorithm has
been shown in Table II.
After mapping the blocks to the SPMs, mapping and un-
mapping commands are set and located in the proper position
within the main source code, based on the sequence of program
execution achieved by static proÔ¨Åling. In addition, the address
of each block in the SPM is determined in this step. These
processes are done by an automatic tool which is developed
as a part of this work.
After determining the positions of all blocks across the
SPM and modifying the source code to implement the proper
mapping scenario, the application is ready to be executed on
the proposed SPM structure. For verifying the effectiveness of

After considering the distribution of read/write operations
and using the calculated formulas, the reliability of the case
study program which was executed on the FTSPM structure is
about 86% while the reliability of the corresponding execution
on the baseline ECC-protected SRAM-based SPM was about
62%. In addition, since the amount of writes which had done
on the STT-RAM region of SPM is efÔ¨Åciently controlled by the
MDA Algorithm, the performance degradation is negligible.
Furthermore, for the same reason the dynamic energy con-
sumption is 44% lower than the baseline SRAM SPM; and as
it was expected, the static energy consumption is signiÔ¨Åcantly
lower than the baseline SRAM SPM (56% reduction was
observed).
As mentioned, the write endurance of STT-RAM cells is
one of the major challenges in using this memory technology
in the SPM. Table III shows the endurance of SPM for a
pure STT-RAM SPM and FTSPM. As reported, the proposed
FTSPM structure and the mapping algorithm signiÔ¨Åcantly
increase the endurance of the SPM. Since there is no common
idea about the threshold number of writes that a STT-RAM
cell could tolerates, the thresholds between lower and upper
bounds which can be found in the articles [2] were considered
in Table III.
Considering the performance of the system, using the NVM
technologies in on-chip memories may increase the execution
time because of its extra write cycle duration in comparison to
SRAM-based memories. To overcome this NVMs drawback,
the FTSPM algorithm considers this challenge through the
primary stage of mapping and deports the write intensive
blocks from the STT-RAM region of the SPM. Furthermore, it
can be seen in Fig. 1 that the read latency of STT-RAM is only
one clock cycle; while for the ECC-protected SRAM region

of the SPM, the read and write latencies are two clock cycles.
Thus, the total amount of time savings on read operations, and
penalties on write operations with considering the mapping
