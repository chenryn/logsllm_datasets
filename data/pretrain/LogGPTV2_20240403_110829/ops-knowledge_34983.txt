User: I have created a simple software with GUI. It has several source files. I can run the project in my editor. I think it is ready for the 1.0 release. But I don't know how to create a setup/installer for my software.
The source is in python. Environment is Linux(Ubuntu). I used an external library which does not come with standard Python library. How can I create the installer, so that I just distribute the source code in the tar file. And the user installs the software on his machine(Linux) by running a setup/installer file?
Please note: When the setup is run, it should automatically take care of the dependencies.(Also, I don't want to build an executable for distribution.)
Something similar to what happens when I type:
sudo apt-get install XXXX
Assistant: Look at 

setuptools
distutils

These are classical tools for python packaging
