**ATT&CK ID:** S0125  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remsec

The Remsec loader disguises itself as "Security Support Provider," a legitimate Windows function. Additionally, various Remsec `.exe` files mimic the names of legitimate files from well-known software vendors such as Microsoft, Symantec, Kaspersky, Hewlett-Packard, and VMware. To further evade detection, Remsec also uses filenames that closely resemble those of custom network encryption software found on the target systems. [139][140]
