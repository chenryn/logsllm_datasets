### Title: I'm Unique, Just Like You: Human Side-Channels and Their Implications for Security and Privacy

In a world of over seven billion people, almost everything about us—our handwriting, DNA, faces, voices, fingerprints, and even our eyes—can be used to distinguish us from one another. These physical identifiers are crucial for law enforcement in tracing real-world crimes and for enabling biometric authentication. However, they often fall short when it comes to tracking or disrupting threat actors in the digital realm.

In this talk, I will delve into "human side-channels"—unintentional, non-physical identifiers that result from human behaviors and activities. These identifiers can still uniquely identify and track individual users online. I will explore how these side-channels work, their potential for both attack and defense, and strategies to counter them. Specifically, I will focus on three types of human side-channels: forensic linguistics, behavioral signatures, and cultural references.

First, I will discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these side-channels, which are rooted in personality psychology and the concepts of consistency and distinctiveness. These characteristics arise from our unique experiences, training, and feedback. I will then explain how each side-channel operates, using case studies and practical examples to illustrate their use in security contexts. This will include scenarios such as identifying and tracking threat actors through hostile social media profiles, post-compromise exfiltration, and privilege escalation.

Additionally, I will examine the privacy implications of these techniques. Unlike physical identifiers, human side-channels are much harder to recognize, obfuscate, or spoof, making them a significant concern for privacy. I will provide detailed insights into possible countermeasures to disguise your own human side-channels, offering practical advice for maintaining privacy in the digital age.

Finally, I will outline some ideas for future research in these areas, highlighting the ongoing importance of understanding and addressing the challenges posed by human side-channels in the field of cybersecurity.
