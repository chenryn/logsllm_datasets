### Network Performance Analysis Across US Regions

We analyzed the performance of four major US carriers—AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon—in three densely populated regions: New York, Seattle, and the Bay Area. Each carrier exhibits different network topologies (including Internet egress, Google ingress, and ASes between) in these regions, which can lead to performance differences.

#### Network Topology and Performance Variations

Despite the diversity in network topologies, our findings indicate that for AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint, both latency and throughput were similar across the three locations. However, Verizon showed varying LTE performance in New York, Seattle, and the Bay Area. Figure 2 illustrates the RTT latencies over time, clearly showing that the Bay Area has lower RTT latency compared to New York and Seattle. The HTTP throughput patterns in these regions also exhibit similar trends.

To further understand the performance differences, we analyzed DNS data in the Seattle area. We found that 97% of DNS requests for google.com resolved to an IP address for a server in the Los Angeles area rather than Seattle, partially explaining the latency gap. For the New York area, our measurements did not provide sufficient geographic information to determine if increased latency was due to path inefficiencies.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Geography alone does not fully explain the variance in performance observed.
- For Verizon, geography plays a role in explaining some of the performance differences.
- Each region experiences independent changes in performance, with negligible correlation across regions for each carrier.
- Within each region, there is a higher correlation between ping RTT and HTTP GET throughput compared to carrier-wide correlations, suggesting that location significantly affects performance.

#### Performance Over Time

Next, we analyzed how network performance varies with time, focusing on time-of-day effects and long-term stability. This analysis helps us identify optimal times for network measurements, such as during known busy hours, and when to avoid measurements, such as at ten-minute intervals, to efficiently allocate limited measurement resources.

**Time-of-Day and Long-Term Trends:**
- Figure 3 shows the HTTP throughput for the four major carriers in the US. As expected, throughput decreases and variance increases during the busy hours (8 AM to 7 PM), likely due to higher network load.
- Different carriers experience minimum throughput at different times:
  - T-Mobile and AT&T reach their minimum throughput at 1 PM and 5 PM, respectively.
  - Sprint experiences its minimum performance at 9 PM.
  - Verizon has two troughs at 8 AM and 9 PM.
- The relative variations in performance during busy hours vary by carrier:
  - AT&T and Sprint's throughput drops by approximately one-third.
  - Verizon's throughput drops by 25%.
  - T-Mobile's throughput drops by 16%.

**Long-Term Performance Trends:**
- We examined long-term performance trends over the duration of our study to assess if new cellular technologies and infrastructure are keeping pace with increased mobile internet usage.
- Our analysis did not show significant improvements; despite technology upgrades, performance remains highly variable over time, with no statistically significant changes during the observation period.

**Stability of Performance:**
- The predictability and stability of network performance are crucial for both users and future experimental measurements.
- We computed stability using a weighted moving average and autocorrelation.
- Data was grouped into 1-hour buckets to obtain a sufficiently large sample size. For each bucket, we used either the median or 5th percentile latency.
- The moving average error was computed for different window sizes and sampling periods.
- Figure 4 plots the average error for all data points with a window size of 2 and different sampling periods for median ping RTT. Similar results were observed with larger window sizes (3, 4, and 5).
- Prediction accuracy varies significantly by carrier, with Verizon and Sprint in the Bay Area being relatively predictable, while T-Mobile and Sprint in Seattle are less predictable.
- For all carriers, prediction accuracy is highest with the most recent data (one-hour sampling period) and tends to increase with longer durations, except for 24-hour and 168-hour (weekly) sampling periods, which are local minima.
- Autocorrelation results support these findings.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the performance characteristics of major US carriers across different regions and time periods, highlighting the importance of considering both geographical and temporal factors in network performance studies.
