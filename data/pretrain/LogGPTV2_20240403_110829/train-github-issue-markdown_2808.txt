When using `--emit=dep-info` in a makefile, a missing file (due to being
renamed or re-factored away) will cause make to terminate the build instantly.
GCC/Clang mitigate this by using the `-MP` flag when creating dependencies,
which emits extra rules of the form `dependency:` to tell make to ignore the
files if they are missing.
