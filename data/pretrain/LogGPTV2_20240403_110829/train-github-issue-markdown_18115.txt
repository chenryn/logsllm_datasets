Hey Bootstrapers. Congrats on the release. BS3 is awesome.
I asked this on the BS3 pull request but didn't get a reply, but it's the one
thing that is bothering me when using BS3:
Shouldn't `.col-sm-*` be named `.col-md-*` instead?
`.col-12` — mobile first, so you can say it affects **small** screens  
`.col-sm-12` — **medium** screens only  
`.col-lg-12` — **large** screens only
Thanks in advance for clarifying this!
~~Since I'm bothering you already, I had another 3-part question:~~
~~Why doesn't col-push/pul/offset work for any screen size? Why not favor one
instead of keeping both push and offset? Would it make sense to be able to
target a screen size like`.col-lg-push-2`?~~
