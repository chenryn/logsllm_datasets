User: yolk -l gives me information that I've got 114 packages installed on my Ubuntu 10.04. After creating new virtualenv directory using 
virtualenv virt_env/virt1 --no-site-packages --clear
I switched to that, my prompt changed and then yolk -l gives me again the same 114 packages. 
What is going on there?
Assistant: If the problem isnt relating to your path (I suppose it is) delete your lib and scripts folder in your project directory to clear out the virtualenv settings. Recreate the virtual env using the command line you posted. Activate the virtualenv and then install yolk.
