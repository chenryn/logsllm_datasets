User: I am new to MAC world. The requirement is to capture ios logs to a file and grep it for a ip address. Using Appium and python2.7, is there any way to do it without launching xcode?
Is there any way to automate it?
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in Advance!!!
Assistant: Installed Apple configurator 2 on my mac.
ran command /usr/local/bin/cfgutil syslog on cammand line prompt to see the log.
