As discussed in #4987, the Atom installer installs a "Open with Atom" entry in
the Windows Explorer context menu for every file and folder. It would be
preferable, as @paulcbetts suggests, to have a prefence where it can be turned
off or on entirely, or just for specific files and folders. For example, not
many people will open images from Explorer with Atom.
@lee-dohm pointed out that the specific code which adds and removes the item
is in https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/browser/squirrel-
update.coffee.
