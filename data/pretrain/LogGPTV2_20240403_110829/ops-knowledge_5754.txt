User: The MSI installers downloadable from python.org does not include Tcl/Tk header (not source) files (that are required to compile some packages like matplotlib). Does anyone know of the rationale behind not including them?
Assistant: The windows installers don't include ANY source files. Simply because that's how windows apps work. It can be compiled on one computer and it will work on all. So windows versions of things like python and php come precompiled with all options enabled.
If you want the source files you have to download a source tarball or something.
