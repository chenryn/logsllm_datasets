User: I'm trying to get the CPU serial or motherboard serial using C or Python for licensing purposes. Is it possible?
I'm using Linux.
Assistant: CPUs no longer obtain a serial number and it's been like that for a while now. For the CPUID - it's unique per CPU model therefore it doesn't help with licensing.
