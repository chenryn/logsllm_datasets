User: How to determine the cause of server performance problems, and what indicators are needed for analysis?
Assistant: Determining the cause of server performance problems requires comprehensive monitoring and analysis of the system. The following are some indicators that may be used: 1. CPU utilization: CPU is one of the most important resources in the server, and should be basically stable under normal conditions. If the CPU utilization is abnormally high, it may be due to a large number of service requests or abnormal process operation. 2. Memory utilization: The server consumes a certain amount of memory when it is running, and high memory utilization may cause server abnormalities or slowness. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the usage of the server memory to detect and solve problems such as memory leaks in time. 3. Hard disk I/O: Hard disk I/O is one of the key attributes of server storage data. Excessive I/O loads can cause disks to respond slowly, affecting application performance. 4. Network traffic: If server containers communicate frequently between themselves or with external applications, network traffic can cause performance issues. It is recommended to monitor network traffic and throughput of servers and programs. 5. Application log: As the name suggests, the application log is a file that records the running process of the application. If your server is experiencing performance issues, you may need to check the application log for specific error messages. 6. Program stack trace: Programmers can determine which functions or methods are most critical to server performance issues by recording and analyzing data on the program stack.
