User: Please provide a suitable network topology for building highly available web applications.
Assistant: The following is a suitable network topology for building highly available web applications: 1. Front-end load balancer: distributes requests from clients to multiple web servers. 2. Web server cluster: multiple servers provide the same web application service at the same time, and share the same database and file system. 3. Database server: Used to store and manage application data. High availability can be ensured using master-slave replication and failover techniques. 4. Cache server: used to cache frequently used data to reduce the pressure on the database server. 5. Security firewall: used to protect the application program from external attacks and ensure the security of the application program operation. Using the above topology, applications can achieve high availability, load balancing, and scalability. When a server fails, other servers can automatically take over its work to ensure service continuity. At the same time, due to the use of load balancing, servers can be easily added or removed to accommodate growth and changes in demand.
