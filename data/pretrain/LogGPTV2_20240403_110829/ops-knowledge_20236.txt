User:  Add a new hard drive to the server and format it as an ext4 file system for data storage.
Assistant: The following are the steps to add a new hard disk on the Linux server and format it as an ext4 file system: 1. Insert the new hard disk: Insert the new hard disk into a free hard disk slot on the server. If the server has no free slots, you need to remove an old hard drive before adding a new one. 2. Check the new hard disk: Open the terminal and enter the following command to check whether the new hard disk is recognized by Linux: ``` sudo fdisk -l ``` After executing this command, you should be able to see the information of the new hard disk. 3. Create a new partition: To create a partition on your new hard drive, enter the following command: ``` sudo fdisk /dev/sdb ``` Note: /dev/sdb is the device name of your new hard drive. If you see multiple devices listed in step 2, please distinguish which one is your new hard drive and change the device name accordingly. Then press the following keyboard buttons to create a new partition: - Enter key "n" - Create new partition - Partition type "p" - Create primary partition - Partition number "1" - Set as first partition - Partition start sector - Press Enter to accept default value - Partition end sector - Press Enter key to accept default value - Enter key "w" - Save changes 4. Format new partition: Enter the following command to format the new partition as ext4 file system: `` ` sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 ``` Note: /dev/sdb1 is the device name of your new partition. Be sure to use your own device name. 5. Mount the new partition: Create a new directory and mount the new partition to it: ``` sudo mkdir /mnt/newdisk sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/newdisk ``` Note: /mnt/newdisk is The new directory you want to create. Please use your own name. 6. Automatically mount new partitions: To automatically mount new partitions every time the server restarts, you need to add this to the /etc/fstab file: ``` sudo nano /etc/fstab ``` and add the following line : ``` /dev/sdb1 /mnt/newdisk ext4 defaults 0 2 ``` Press CTRL+X, Y and Enter to save the changes. Now you have successfully formatted your new hard disk as ext4 file system and can use /mnt/newdisk directory to save data.
