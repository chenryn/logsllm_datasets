Fig. 3: Monthly V1 values for each ransomware family.
We then apply Filter 1, and the resultant amounts of bitcoin
inﬂows are shown in the V1 column. Since we are summing
up inﬂow amounts that conform to known payment patterns,
V1 offers an estimate on each ransomware’s revenue from
ransom payments. We stress that V1 is an underestimate; per
our discussion in Section IV-E, an unknown number of wallet
addresses are likely to be missing from our clusters.
To show how much of the original inﬂows satisﬁes Filter
1, we calculate the ratio, V1
V0 . A larger ratio suggests a higher
coverage and that we can account for a higher portion of values
in the inﬂows as potential ransom revenue; for instance, 99.7%
of Cerber’s inﬂow values potentially consist of victim pay-
ments. In contrast, this ratio is low for certain families, likely
because we are unable to identify all known payment amounts
or Bitcoin graph properties. Spora victims, for example, can
choose to pay for one or multiple ransom “packages”. The
ransom amounts are not ﬁxed for each victim. As expected,
V1 for Spora only includes payments by the real victims we
found in public sources, rather than by potential victims that
we do not know about.
Filter 2: Another signal for an inﬂow to be a likely ransom
payment is that the inﬂow sends bitcoins from an exchange’s
cluster to a ransomware cluster. As described in Section II,
a ransom note typically suggests that the victim purchases
bitcoins from exchanges, presumably because a random victim
is unlikely to already possess bitcoins himself. Thus, we
assume that a victim is likely to ﬁrst acquire bitcoins from an
exchange, before sending the bitcoins to his ransom address.
To this end, we develop Filter 2, which includes an inﬂow
transaction only if it sends bitcoins from a wallet address(es)
from a known exchange’s cluster. We check if a wallet
address belongs to an exchange, and what exchange, using
Chainalysis’ API.
Chainalysis is a proprietary online service that links clus-
ters of wallet addresses to the likely real-world identities. It
regularly transacts with known Bitcoin-related services, such
as exchanges, to discover and cluster wallet addresses used
by these services [5], while excluding CoinJoin transactions
using a proprietary heuristics-based algorithm.
We show the result as V2 in the table. The ratio of V2
V0
suggests how much of a ransomware family’s inﬂows is sent
from exchange clusters. For 6 of the 10 families, this ratio is
lower than V1
V0 , but

V. PAYMENT ANALYSIS
Based on the methods we created in the prior sections,
we are able to estimate each ransomware family’s revenue
in Section V-A and characterize potential victim payments in
Sections V-B through V-D. Finally, we measure the potential
cash-out behaviors in Section V-E.
A. Estimating Revenue
The V1 column in Table IV shows the total revenue poten-
tially generated from ransom payments. To visualize the likely
revenue over time, we plot a stacked bar graph, Figure 3. In
total, we are able to trace $16,322,006 US Dollars in 19,750
likely victim ransom payments for 5 ransomware families over
22 months. This is probably a conservative estimate of total
victim ransom payments due to our incomplete coverage.
B. Payment Mechanisms
Some of the victims likely purchased bitcoins from ex-
changes before paying the ransom. We would like to determine
what these exchanges are and how much of the ransom came
from each exchange. For every inﬂow that satisﬁes Filter 1,
we identify the input wallet addresses and construct a cluster
using the co-spending heuristic; we call this cluster the source
cluster. We use Chainalysis’ API to determine the likely real-
world identity of the source cluster; it could be an exchange,
a non-exchange, or “Unknown,” in which case Chainalysis
has no information regarding the cluster’s identity. For each
ransomware family, we identify the top three exchanges that
sent the highest amount of inﬂows in US Dollars. Across

Fig. 5: Inﬂows to Cerber and Locky that satisfy Filter 1.
the ﬁve ransomware families we study, the top exchanges
include BTC-e, Bithumb, Coin.mx, Coinbase, Korbit, and
LocalBitcoins. We label all other exchanges or real-world
entities as “Misc”. Figure 4 presents the breakdown of V1
values by exchanges, relative to the total V1 of each family.
We truncate the x-axis at 60% to highlight the distribution of
known exchanges.
Of the top exchanges, both Bithumb and Korbit require
users to purchase bitcoins in Korean Won. Also, both require
users to have Korean phone numbers upon account creation.
These requirements present hurdles to non-Korean users at-
tempting to use these exchanges. Both of these exchanges ac-
count for $2,619,709, or 34.1% of Cerber’s ransom payments,
likely paid for by victims in South Korea. The remaining four
exchanges, in contrast, do not have such geographic restriction;
international users can deposit money to these four exchanges
and purchase bitcoins.
C. Payment Dynamics
Once a victim acquires bitcoins, she typically sends the
bitcoins to a ransom address. For ransomware families that
generate a unique ransom address per victim, such as Cer-
ber and Locky, we can use the likely ransom addresses to
characterize the individual behaviors of potential victims. In
particular, we can estimate the number of paying victims by
counting the number of likely ransom addresses, as shown
in the bottom chart of Figure 5. The Locky cluster sees
the highest number of likely ransom addresses on March 18,
2016, when 198 victims are likely to have paid a ransom.
In the top chart, we plot
the median inﬂow amount per
likely ransom address. Of particular note, Locky received a
median inﬂow amount of $4,137 on June 18, 2016 across two
likely ransom addresses: one received 4 bitcoins ($3,008) in
a single transaction, and the other received 7 bitcoins also in
a single transaction ($5,265). Unfortunately, we do not have
an explanation for these larger payments, but they make up a
tiny fraction of the payments.
In addition to using the median, we present the distribution
of inﬂow amounts per likely ransom address in Figure 6,
