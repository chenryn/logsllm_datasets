### How are you using Babel?
@babel/cli
### Input code
Error occurring after installed latest @babel/core
### Configuration file name
babel.config.js
### Configuration
_No response_
### Current and expected behavior
Getting error
> Cannot find module '@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object'
### Environment
  * Babel version: latest (7.22.0)
  * Node: 16
  * yarn v1.22.19
  * Mac OS Venutura / Ubuntu 22.0.4
### Possible solution
It's working fine after I installed `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-
in-object` .
`yarn add @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object --dev`
### Additional context
Seems the latest release 7.22.0 has an issue.  
It was working properly until few hours ago.
