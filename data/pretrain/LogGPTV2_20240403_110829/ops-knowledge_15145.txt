User:  company needs to monitor its servers. Please provide a feasible monitoring solution, including indicators, monitoring tools, and alarm strategies.
Assistant: Solution: 1. Indicators: Monitoring indicators include CPU usage, memory usage, disk space usage, network traffic, etc. 2. Monitoring tools: Monitoring software such as Zabbix or Nagios can be used for monitoring, and these software provide a wealth of monitoring indicators and monitoring functions. In addition, Grafana can be used for data visualization to observe the running status of the server conveniently and intuitively. 3. Alarm strategy: When monitoring indicators are abnormal, alarm information should be sent in time. It is recommended to set multiple alarm channels, including email, SMS, WeChat, telephone, etc., and set the alarm level and alarm personnel. For example, an alert is sent when CPU usage is consistently higher than 80%, and a critical alert is sent when memory usage is consistently higher than 90%. At the same time, it is recommended to set up an automatic alarm processing method, such as automatically cleaning up junk files when the disk space is insufficient to avoid server downtime.
