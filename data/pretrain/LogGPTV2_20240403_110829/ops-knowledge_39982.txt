User: How to mount external files or directories in a Docker container?
Assistant: When starting a Docker container, you can use `-v` or `--volume` parameters to mount external files or directories: ``` docker run -v /path/to/local/directory:/container/directory image-name ``` The above command mounts the local directory `/path/to/local/directory` to the `/container/directory` directory of the Docker container. You can also use the `--mount` parameter to mount external files or directories: ``` docker run --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/local/directory,target=/container/directory image-name ` `` This command has the same function as the previous command, but it uses different command parameters. In the Docker Compose file, you can use the `volumes` property to specify external files or directories to mount: ``` volumes: - /path/to/local/directory:/container/directory ```
