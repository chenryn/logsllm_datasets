User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题12.04LTS - could not open a connection to your authentication agent I'm working on adding ssh authentication to a fresh Linode Ubuntu 12.04LTS deployment. I followed their guide to the letter up to the point where I need to ssh into the box with my now freshly added ssh key, but I instead get:

"Error: agent admitted failure to sign using the key"


Which is fine, the Ubuntu OpenSSH guide says that all you need to do is to run

ssh-add


on the server and you'll be golden. Except when I do that I get 

Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.


I double-checked the processes and indeed it does look like ssh-agent is already running (in fact twice, because I tried the eval trick, which didn't work at all):

alex@mybox:~$ ps aux | grep ssh
root      2645  0.0  0.1  49948   776 ?        Ss   Mar13   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
alex     16989  0.0  0.0  12492   324 ?        Ss   Mar13   0:00 ssh-agent
root     18986  0.0  0.7  73360  3564 ?        Ss   09:03   0:00 sshd: alex [priv]   
alex     19119  0.0  0.3  73360  1676 ?        S    09:03   0:00 sshd: alex@pts/0

alex     20184  0.0  0.3  73360  1680 ?        S    10:03   0:00 sshd: alex@pts/1    
alex     20325  0.0  0.1   9384   924 pts/1    S+   10:13   0:00 grep --color=auto ssh


As I mentioned, the eval approach managed to make ssh-add work once, but when I tried to log in again, the system reported the same error I listed above. I also now have two instances of ssh-agent. 

What is the proper way of addressing this?

Assistant: Try starting the ssh-agent for your current bash session. Here is what you need to do. 


Test your current env for ssh-agent PID: 

env | grep ^SSH

If you don't notice any, then start the ssh-agent for your current env:

exec ssh-agent bash

Now try to add the key:

ssh-add
