Assistant: 1. Control network access Realize authorized access control of the network, prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing the network, and identify and authorize and limit access to network resources. 2.

Intrusion detection monitors and detects potential attacks in the network, and takes timely measures to minimize risks. 7. Training Provide employees with security awareness training to help them understand cybersecurity and improve their cybersecurity knowledge. 8. Service Provider Management ensures that connections with partners/service providers are flawless and monitors service provider security measures to ensure confidentiality and integrity of information. 9. Software update Regularly review the off-shelf applications, network patches and standard software updates, and update the system in time. 10. Cross-site scripting uses isolation technology to separate users and applications to prevent unauthorized modification and tampering.
