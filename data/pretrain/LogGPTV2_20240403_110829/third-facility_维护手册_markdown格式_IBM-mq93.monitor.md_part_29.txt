MQPUT Application Activity Distribution List PCF Group Header Structure
If the MQPUT function is putting to a distribution list, then the MQPUT parameters include one
AppActivityDistList PCF group. For each of the queues in the distribution list, see “Application Activity
Distribution List PCF Group Header Structure” on page 252. The AppActivityDistList PCF group combines
information from the MQPMR, and MQRR structures to identify the PUT parameters, and indicate the
result of the PUT operation on each queue. For MQPUT operations the AppActivityDistList group contains
some or all of the following parameters (the CompCode and Reason is present if the reason code is
MQRC_MULTIPLE_REASONS and the other parameters are determined by the MQPMO.PutMsgRecFields
field):
CompCode
