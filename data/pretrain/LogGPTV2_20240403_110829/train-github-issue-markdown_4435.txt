### Issue: Exception When Using Certain Colors in Custom Palette

**I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.**

#### Expected Behavior
- The application should not throw any exceptions when using custom colors in the palette.

#### Current Behavior
When using certain colors, the application throws a `TypeError` with the following stack trace:

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'charAt' of undefined

    at lighten (https://1325w0wqk7.codesandbox.io/node_modules/material-ui/styles/colorManipulator.js:226:11)

    at createMuiTheme (https://1325w0wqk7.codesandbox.io/node_modules/material-ui/styles/createMuiTheme.js:71:45)
```

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the [CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/1325w0wqk7).
2. Refer to the `demo.js` file.
3. Use the color `purple` - it works as expected.
4. Try using `orange`, `deepOrange`, or `lightBlue` (and possibly other colors) - the application throws a `TypeError`.

#### Context
This issue occurs when trying to use specific colors in the custom palette, which causes the application to crash.

#### Environment
- **Material-UI**: next
- **React**: latest
- **Browser**: Chrome
