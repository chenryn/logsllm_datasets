User: In the file part-00000 we can find the result of all the process (map+reduce), but i would like to see the result of the firt step (mapping) then the whole results. 
I'm working on Hadoop Cloudera with python map-reduce scripts.
Assistant: If that's just for initial analysis purpose to understand the data and key then you probably would like to set the Reducer count to 0 and get the map's output.
-D mapred.reduce.tasks =0 is a way in java, explore the same for Python.
