## Description:
> Can you break into this super secure portal?
## Solution: 
We visit the website and get the following page:
```html
Secure Login Portal
This is the secure login portal
Enter valid credentials to proceed
```
There are obviously many easy ways to solve this, but just for fun(?) - here's a bash command that uses sorting and string replacement to display the flag:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/dont-use-client-side# curl -s https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21888/ | grep substring | sed "s/') {/\n/g" | sed "s/[[:space:]]*if (checkpass.substring(\(split\*\|\)//g" | sort -n | awk '{ printf $4 }' | tr -d "'" && echo
picoCTF{no_clients_plz_56a8eb}
```
