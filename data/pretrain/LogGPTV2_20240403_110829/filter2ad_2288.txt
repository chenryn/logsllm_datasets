## Introduction

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are smart systems that integrate networks of physical and computational components to control and govern physical processes. Examples include nuclear plants, power generation, water treatment plants, and transportation systems. These systems are critical for our daily lives and are composed of a large number of devices such as sensors, actuators, and controllers, which operate in feedback control loops.

### Feedback Control Loop

Feedback control loops are the primary method used to stabilize physical values in CPS. A typical threshold controller uses an actuator with two possible commands: `INC` (increase) and `DEC` (decrease). The system has two thresholds, `Thigh` and `Tlow`. When the sensor measurements reach `Thigh`, the controller changes its output to decrease the signal, and when the measurements reach `Tlow`, the controller increases the signal.

```
DEC
Thigh
Tlow
INC
```

This method is widely used in various applications, including phase controllers, current limiters, and pH controllers.

### Device Selection

Devices in CPS are chosen based on their specifications and cost. For example:

| Device | Specification | Price |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Device A | High Quality  | Expensive |
| Device B | Sufficient Quality | Cheap |

In a supply chain attack, an attacker may offer a cheaper device with sufficient specifications or replace a benign device with a malicious one. The goal of the attacker is to cause damage by deploying their own malicious device.

## Attacker Challenges

### Communication Between Malicious Devices

A successful, stealthy attack requires communication between malicious devices, such as from a corrupt sensor to a corrupt actuator. Without this cooperation, the attack can be easily detected.

### How to Communicate Between Malicious Devices?

- **Sensor to Actuator (S2A)**: This work.
- **Actuator to Sensor (A2S)**: Previous work.

### Avoiding Detection

The attacker must also avoid detection. This involves creating a covert channel that is not easily monitored.

## Chatty-Sensor Communication Method

For each time-step \( k \), the sensor reports a value \( z_k \). Whenever \( z_k \) passes a threshold, the controller switches the command \( u_k \in \{INC, DEC\} \) to the actuator. The process value continuously iterates and passes the thresholds \( Thigh \) and \( Tlow \).

The sensor encodes covert bits of information based on the parity of the transition time-steps:
- Transition at even/odd times signals bit 0/1.

Assumption: The sensor and actuator have parity-synchronized clocks.

### Example

- Transitions at \( k = 7, 12, 16, 21, 26, 31 \)
- Encoded message: \( M = 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 \)

### Influence on Transition Time-Step

The chatty-sensor influences the transition time-step by decreasing or increasing the reported value. For example, if a transition is about to happen at \( k=9 \) but should be at \( k=10 \), the chatty-sensor reduces the reported value at \( k=9 \) to ensure the transition occurs at \( k=10 \).

## Covert Channels

Covert channels use unmonitored properties to encode information. Examples include:
- Light brightness ("Extended functionality attacks on IoT devices: The case of smart lights," Shamir et al., 2016)
- Packet headers ("Embedding Covert Channels into TCP/IP," Murdoch et al., 2005)
- Acoustic emissions of a motor ("Process-aware covert channels using physical instrumentation in cyber-physical systems," Krishnamurthy et al., 2018)

Monitoring these properties can reveal the communication channel.

## Provable Covert Channels

A provable covert channel is one where it is impossible to detect the channel under well-defined assumptions. In IT networks, provable channels have been presented in the past (Liu et al., 2010). For CPS, a provably-covert channel was introduced in "The Leaky Actuator: A Provably-covert Channel in Cyber Physical Systems" (Herzberg and Kfir, 2019).

### Chatty-Sensor Covert Channel

To avoid detection, the chatty-sensor uses an internal accurate sensor to measure the process. At time-steps with transitions, the chatty-sensor adds positive or negative noise to the internal sensor. At other time-steps, the chatty-sensor randomly chooses positive or negative noise to add.

#### Problem and Solution

- **Encoding**: The channel is noisy. Solution: Use error correction codes (ECC).
- **Indistinguishability**: If the encoded message is all zeros, the noise at the transitions will always be derived from a specific distribution. Solution: Send pseudo-random bits derived from the message.

## Evaluation

### Channel Capacity

The channel capacity is the highest information rate that can be achieved. In a pH control process Simulink simulation, the chatty-sensor achieved about 0.12 bits of information per transition. With one transition every 5 seconds, this results in 1.44 bits per minute.

### Bit-Error-Rate (BER)

The BER is the fraction of errors in the bits decoding. Using repetition as an error-correction code, the chatty-sensor design had ~10% decoding errors with a repetition of 13. Future work will focus on improving the BER.

## Summary and Discussion

Choosing devices based on specification and price enables provable covert attacks. This is the first provable covert channel from sensors to actuators. To improve defenses, randomness can be added to the channel, and devices can be purchased from different vendors. Future work will aim to improve the BER, possibly using non-provable methods.
