User: I need to run a monkeyrunner script in a remote machine. I'm using python to to automate it and RPyC so that I could connect to other machines, everything is running in CentOS.
written below is the command that I used:

import rpyc
import subprocess
conn = rpyc.classic.connect("192.XXX.XXX.XXX",XXXXX)
conn.execute ("print 'Hello'")
subprocess.Popen("/opt/android-sdk/tools/monkeyrunner -v ALL
/opt/android-sdk/tools/MYSCRIPT.py", shell=True)

and this is the result:

can't open specified script file
Usage : monkeyrunner [option] script_file
-s MonkeyServer IP Address
-p MonkeyServer TCP Port
-v MonkeyServer Logging level

And then I realized that if you use the command below, it is running the command in your machine. (example: the command inside the Popen is "ls" the result that it will give you is the list of files and directories in the current directory of the LOCALHOST) hence, the command is wrong.

subprocess.Popen("/opt/android-sdk/tools/monkeyrunner -v ALL
/opt/android-sdk/tools/MYSCRIPT.py", shell=True)

and so I replaced the code with this

conn.modules.subprocess.Popen("/opt/android-sdk/tools/monkeyrunner -v ALL
/opt/android-sdk/tools/MYSCRIPT.py", shell=True)

And give me this error message

  line 438, in sync_request
      raise obj OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

I am thinking that it cannot run the file because I don't have administrator access (since I didn't supply the username and password of the remote machine)?
Help!
Assistant: Using this function to run monekyrunner doesn't work although running ls, pwd works fine.

conn.modules.subprocess.Popen("/opt/android-sdk/tools/monkeyrunner -v
  ALL
  /opt/android-sdk/tools/MYSCRIPT.py", shell=True)

The chunk of code below solved my problem : 

import rpyc
import subprocess , os
conn = rpyc.classic.connect("192.XXX.XXX.XXX",XXXXX)
conn.execute ("print 'Hello'")
conn.modules.os.popen("monkeyrunner -v ALL MYSCRIPT.py",)

Hope this helps to those who are experiencing the same problem as mine.
