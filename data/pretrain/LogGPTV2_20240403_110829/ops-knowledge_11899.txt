I need to run a `monkeyrunner` script on a remote machine. I am using Python for automation and `RPyC` to connect to the remote machine. The environment is running on CentOS.

Below is the initial command I used:

```python
import rpyc
import subprocess

conn = rpyc.classic.connect("192.XXX.XXX.XXX", XXXXX)
conn.execute("print 'Hello'")
subprocess.Popen("/opt/android-sdk/tools/monkeyrunner -v ALL /opt/android-sdk/tools/MYSCRIPT.py", shell=True)
```

The output was:

```
can't open specified script file
Usage: monkeyrunner [option] script_file
-s MonkeyServer IP Address
-p MonkeyServer TCP Port
-v MonkeyServer Logging level
```

I realized that the `subprocess.Popen` command was running on the local machine, not the remote one. For example, if the command inside `Popen` was `"ls"`, it would list the files and directories in the current directory of the local machine. Therefore, the command was incorrect.

I then modified the code to use `conn.modules.subprocess.Popen` to execute the command on the remote machine:

```python
conn.modules.subprocess.Popen("/opt/android-sdk/tools/monkeyrunner -v ALL /opt/android-sdk/tools/MYSCRIPT.py", shell=True)
```

This resulted in the following error:

```

```

I suspected that the issue might be due to a lack of administrator access, as I did not provide the username and password for the remote machine.

After further investigation, I found that using `conn.modules.os.popen` instead of `conn.modules.subprocess.Popen` resolved the problem. The working code is as follows:

```python
import rpyc
import subprocess
import os

conn = rpyc.classic.connect("192.XXX.XXX.XXX", XXXXX)
conn.execute("print 'Hello'")
conn.modules.os.popen("monkeyrunner -v ALL MYSCRIPT.py")
```

This solution should help others who encounter the same issue.
