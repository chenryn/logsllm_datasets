passwords you want to reset, and authenticate as an administrator of the domain.
To open a directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of users and 
choose from the pop-up menu.
If you want to set the password type to be Open Directory, you must authenticate as 
an administrator whose password type is Open Directory.
3 Command-click or Shift-click user accounts to select all accounts whose password type 
needs to be changed. 
4 Enter a password on the Basic pane, then set the User Password Type option on the 
Advanced pane.
5 Click Save.
6 Tell the users the temporary password so they can log in.
After logging in with the temporary password, a user can change the password by 
clicking Accounts in System Preferences.
If you change the password of accounts whose password type is Open Directory and 
the accounts reside in the LDAP directory of an Open Directory replica or master, the 
change will eventually be synchronized with the master and all its replicas. Mac OS X 
Server automatically synchronizes changes to Open Directory passwords among a 
master and its replicas.

Chapter 6    Managing User Authentication
Changing the Global Password Policy
Using Server Admin, you can set a global password policy for user accounts in a 
Mac OS X Server directory domain. The global password policy affects user accounts in 
the server’s local directory domain. If the server is an Open Directory master or replica, 
the global password policy also affects the server’s LDAP directory domain. If you 
change the global password policy on an Open Directory replica, the policy settings 
will eventually be synchronized with the master and any other replicas of it.
Both Kerberos and Open Directory Password Server enforce password policies. Some 
password policy rules apply to Open Directory Password Server and Kerberos, and 
some apply only to Open Directory Password Server. Mac OS X Server synchronizes the 
password policy rules that apply to both Kerberos and Open Directory Password Server.
Administrator accounts are always exempt from password policies. Each user can have 
an individual password policy that overrides some of the global password policy 
settings. For more information, see “Setting Password Policies for Individual Users” on 
page 75. 
To change the global password policy of all user accounts in the same domain:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for a server in the Computers & Services 
list.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click Authentication (near the 
top).
3 Set the password policy options you want enforced for users who do not have their 
own individual password policies.
“Disable login on __”:  If you select this option, enter a date in mm/dd/yyyy format; for 
example, 02/22/2005.
“Password must be changed every __”:  If you select this option, remember that some 
service protocols don’t allow users to change passwords. For example, users can’t 
change their passwords when authenticating for IMAP mail service, and users can’t 
change passwords when authenticating for Windows file service. 
4 Click Save.
Replicas of the Open Directory master automatically inherit its global password policy.

Setting Password Policies for Individual Users
Using Workgroup Manager, you can set password policies for individual user accounts 
whose password type is Open Directory. The password policy for a user overrides the 
global password policy defined on the Authentication Settings pane of Open Directory 
service in Server Admin. Administrator accounts are always exempt from password 
policies.
Both Kerberos and Open Directory Password Server enforce password policies. Some 
password policy rules apply to Open Directory Password Server and Kerberos, and 
some apply only to Open Directory Password Server. Mac OS X Server synchronizes the 
password policy rules that apply to both Kerberos and Open Directory Password Server.
To set a user account’s password policy, you must have administrator rights for Open 
Directory authentication in the directory domain that contains the user accounts 
whose password policy you want to change. This means you must authenticate as a 
directory domain administrator whose password type is Open Directory. For more 
information, see “Assigning Administrator Rights for Open Directory Authentication” on 
page 80. 
To change the password policy for a user account:
1 In Workgroup Manager, open the account you want to work with if it is not already 
open.
To open an account, click the Accounts button, then click the Users button. Click the 
small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu to open the 
directory domain where the user’s account resides. Click the lock and authenticate as a 
directory domain administrator whose password type is Open Directory. Then select 
the user in the list.
2 Click Advanced, then click Options.
You can click Options only if the password type is Open Directory.
3 Change password policy options, then click OK.
“Disable login on date __”:  If you select this option, enter a date in mm/dd/yyyy 
format; for example, 02/22/2005.
“Require a change every __ days”:  If you select this option, remember that some 
service protocols don’t allow users to change passwords. For example, users can’t 
change their passwords when authenticating for IMAP mail service. 
The password ID is a unique 128-bit number assigned when the password is created in 
the Open Directory Password Server database. It might be helpful in troubleshooting, 
since it appears in the Password Server log when a problem occurs. View this Open 
Directory log in Server Admin.

Chapter 6    Managing User Authentication
Changing a User’s Password Type
You can set the password type on the Advanced pane of Workgroup Manager to one of 
the following:
• Open Directory
• Shadow password
• Crypt password
Setting a user’s password type to Open Directory enables multiple legacy 
authentication methods and also enables single signon and Kerberos if the user’s 
account is in an LDAP directory. You can also enable a user account to use simple LDAP 
bind authentication. For explanations of the authentication options, see Chapter 3, 
“User Authentication With Open Directory.”
Changing the Password Type to Open Directory
Using Workgroup Manager, you can specify that Open Directory be used for 
authenticating one or more user accounts stored in the local directory domain or the 
LDAP directory domain of Mac OS X Server. In addition, you can specify that Open 
Directory be used for authenticating user accounts in any LDAP or NetInfo directory 
domain residing on a server with Mac OS X Server version 10.2.
The Open Directory password type supports single signon using Kerberos 
authentication. It also supports the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) 
authentication protocols, which include APOP, CRAM-MD5, DHX, Digest-MD5, MS-
CHAPv2, SMB-NT, SMB-LAN Manager, and WebDAV-Digest.
To set a user account’s password type to Open Directory, you must have administrator 
rights for Open Directory authentication in the directory domain that contains the user 
account. This means you must authenticate as a directory domain administrator whose 
password type is Open Directory. For more information, see “Assigning Administrator 
Rights for Open Directory Authentication” on page 80.

Chapter 6    Managing User Authentication
77
To specify that a user account authenticate using Open Directory:
1 Make sure the user’s account resides in a directory domain that supports Open 
Directory authentication.
Directory domains on Mac OS X Server version 10.3 support Open Directory 
authentication, as do directory domains on Mac OS X Server version 10.2 that are 
configured to use a Password Server.
2 In Workgroup Manager, open the account you want to work with if it is not already 
open.
To open an account, click the Accounts button, then click the Users button. Click the 
small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu to open the 
directory domain where the user’s account resides. Click the lock and authenticate as a 
directory domain administrator whose password type is Open Directory. Then select 
the user in the list.
3 Click Advanced, then choose Open Directory from the User Password Type pop-up 
menu.
4 If you changed the user’s password type, you will be prompted to enter and verify a 
new password. 
If you are working with a new user, enter the password on the Basic pane in the 
Password field, then reenter it in the Verify field. 
The password must contain no more than 512 bytes (up to 512 characters, although the 
network authentication protocol can impose different limits; for example, 128 
characters for SMB-NT and 14 for SMB-LAN Manager. The user management guide 
provides guidelines for choosing passwords).
5 On the Advanced pane, click Options to set up the user’s password policy, and click OK 
when you have finished specifying options
If you select the “Disable login as of” option, enter a date in MM/DD/YYYY format; for 
example, 02/22/2004.
If you use a policy that requires user password changing, remember that not all 
protocols support changing passwords. For example, users can’t change their 
passwords when authenticating for IMAP mail service. 
The password ID is a unique 128-bit number assigned when the password is created in 
the Open Directory Password Server database. It might be helpful in troubleshooting, 
since it appears in the Password Server log when a problem occurs. View this Open 
Directory log in Server Admin.

Chapter 6    Managing User Authentication
Changing the Password Type to Crypt Password
Using Workgroup Manager, you can specify that a crypt password be used for 
authenticating one or more user accounts stored in an LDAP or NetInfo directory 
domain. The LDAP directory domain can be on any server, but cannot be a read-only 
directory. The NetInfo domain can be on any Mac OS X Server.
The crypt password is stored as an encrypted value, or hash, in the user account. 
Because the crypt password can be recovered easily from the directory domain, it is 
subject to offline attack and therefore is less secure than other password types.
To specify that a user account authenticate using a crypt password:
1 In Workgroup Manager, open the account you want to work with if it is not already 
open.
To open an account, click the Accounts button, then click the Users button. Click the 
small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu to open the 
directory domain where the user’s account resides. Click the lock and authenticate as a 
directory domain administrator. Then select the user in the list.
2 Click Advanced, then choose “Crypt password” from the User Password Type pop-up 
menu.
3 If you changed the user’s password type, you will be prompted to enter and verify a 
new password. 
If you are working with a new user, enter the password on the Basic pane in the 
Password field, then reenter it in the Verify field. 
A crypt password can be at most eight bytes (eight ASCII characters) long. If you enter 
a longer password, only the first eight bytes are used.
4 Click Save.

Changing the Password Type to Shadow Password
Using Workgroup Manager, you can specify that a user have a shadow password stored 
in a secure file apart from the directory domain. Only users whose accounts reside in 
the local directory domain can have a shadow password.
To specify that a user account authenticate using a shadow password:
1 In Workgroup Manager, open the account you want to work with if it is not already 
open.
To open an account, click the Accounts button, then click the Users button. Click the 
small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu to open the 
local directory domain where the user’s account resides. Click the lock and authenticate 
as a directory domain administrator. Then select the user in the list.
2 Click Advanced, then choose Shadow Password from the User Password Type pop-up 
menu.
3 If you changed the user’s password type, you will be prompted to enter and verify a 
new password. 
If you are working with a new user, enter the password on the Basic pane in the 
Password field, then reenter it in the Verify field. 
4 Click Save.
Enabling Single Signon Authentication for a User
You enable single signon authentication for a user account in an LDAP directory 
Mac OS X Server version 10.3 by using the Advanced pane of Workgroup Manager to 
set the account’s password type to Open Directory. Single signon is a feature of 
Kerberos authentication. For instructions, see “Changing the Password Type to Open 
Directory” on page 76. 
Enabling Kerberos Authentication for a User
You enable Kerberos authentication for a user account in an LDAP directory of 
Mac OS X Server version 10.3 by setting the account’s password type to Open Directory 
on the Advanced pane of Workgroup Manager. For instructions, see “Changing the 
Password Type to Open Directory” on page 76.

Chapter 6    Managing User Authentication
Enabling LDAP Bind Authentication for a User
You can use Workgroup Manager to enable the use of LDAP bind authentication for a 
user account stored in an LDAP directory domain. When you use this password 
validation technique, you rely on the LDAP server that contains the user account to 
authenticate the user’s password. 
To enable LDAP bind user authentication using Workgroup Manager:
1 Make sure the account for a user whose password you want to validate using LDAP 
bind resides on an LDAP server in the search path of the Mac OS X computer that 
needs to validate the password. 
See “Accessing LDAP Directories” on page 90 for information about configuring LDAP 
server connections. Avoid mapping the password attribute when configuring the 
connection; bind authentication will occur automatically. Also, set up the connection so 
it uses SSL in order to protect the password, passed in clear text, while it is in transit.
2 In Workgroup Manager, open the account you want to work with if it is not already 
open. 
To open an account, click the Accounts button, then click the Users button. Click the 
small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu to open the 
LDAP directory domain where the user’s account resides. Click the lock and 
authenticate as a directory domain administrator. Then select the user in the user list.
3 On the Advanced pane, choose “Crypt password” from the User Password Type pop-up 
menu.
4 On the Basic pane, make sure the Password field is empty.
5 Click Save.
Assigning Administrator Rights for Open Directory 
Authentication
You can work with Open Directory authentication settings in Workgroup Manager only 
if you authenticate as an administrator of the directory domain that contains the user 
accounts you want to work with. In addition, the administrator must use Open 
Directory authentication. These restrictions protect the security of passwords stored in 
the Kerberos KDC and the Open Directory Password Server database. See “Changing 
the Password Type to Open Directory” on page 76. For instructions on assigning 
administrator rights for a directory domain, see the user accounts chapter in the user 
management guide. 
Do not use the Options button on the Advanced pane to set up password policies for 
directory domain administrators. Password policies are not enforced for administrator 
accounts. Directory domain administrators need to be able to change password 
policies of individual user accounts.

Exporting and Importing Users Whose Password Type Is 
Open Directory
When you export user accounts whose password type is set to Open Directory, 
passwords are not exported. This protects the security of the Open Directory Password 
Server database. Before importing, you can use a spreadsheet application to open the 
file of exported users and preset their passwords, which they can change the next time 
they log in. 
After importing, you have a couple of options for setting the passwords of the 
imported user accounts:
• You can set all the imported user accounts to use a temporary password, which each 
user can change the next time he or she logs in. For instructions, see “Resetting the 
Passwords of Multiple Users” on page 73. 
• You can set the password of each imported user account individually on the Basic 
pane of Workgroup Manager. For instructions, see “Changing a User’s Password Type” 
on page 76. 
Exporting and Importing Authentication Manager Users
When you export user accounts that have crypt passwords from a NetInfo domain for 
which Authentication Manager is enabled, passwords are not exported. After importing 
to a directory domain of Mac OS X Server version 10.3, you have a couple of options for 
setting the passwords of the imported user accounts:
• You can set all the imported user accounts to use a temporary password, which each 
user can change the next time he or she logs in. For instructions, see “Resetting the 
Passwords of Multiple Users” on page 73. 
• You can set the password of each imported user account individually on the Basic 
pane of Workgroup Manager. For instructions, see “Changing a User’s Password Type” 
on page 76. 
Authentication Manager is a legacy technology for securely validating passwords. 
Authentication Manager only works with user accounts that were created in a NetInfo 
domain of Mac OS X Server version 10.0–10.2. Authentication Manager must have been 
enabled for the NetInfo domain. For more information, see Appendix C, “Authentication 
Manager.”

Chapter 6    Managing User Authentication
Migrating Passwords to Open Directory Authentication
User accounts can be migrated from earlier versions of Mac OS X Server by importing 
the account records or upgrading the server where they reside. User accounts created 
with Mac OS X Server version 10.1 or earlier have no authentication authority attribute 
but do have crypt passwords. For compatibility with such user accounts, Mac OS X 
Server version 10.2 and later assumes a user account without an authentication 
authority attribute has a crypt password. 
If you import user accounts from Mac OS X Server version 10.1 or earlier, the user 
accounts have no authentication authority attribute. Therefore these user accounts are 
initially configured to have crypt passwords. An appendix in the user management 
guide describes how to import user accounts. 
Likewise, if you upgrade from Mac OS X Server version 10.1 or earlier, user accounts that 
were created before upgrading have no authentication authority attribute. After 
upgrading, these user accounts are assumed to have crypt passwords.
While all the existing crypt passwords can continue to be used after importing or 
upgrading, you can change the user accounts to use Open Directory authentication. 
You can change individual user accounts or multiple user accounts by using Workgroup 
Manager. Changing a user account’s password type will reset the password. For 
instructions, see “Changing the Password Type to Open Directory” on page 76. 
Some user accounts created with Mac OS X Server version 10.1 or earlier may use 
Authentication Manager. It is a legacy technology for authenticating users of Windows 
file service and users of Apple file service whose Mac OS 8 computers have not been 
upgraded with AFP client software version 3.8.3 or later.
When migrating Authentication Manager users, you have the following options:
• If you upgrade server version first from Mac OS X Server version 10.1 to version 10.2 
and then to version 10.3, existing users can continue to use their same passwords.
• You can change some or all upgraded user accounts to use Open Directory 
authentication, which is the preferred option for authenticating Windows users. Users 
of both types can coexist in the same directory domain.
• If you import user accounts that use Authentication Manager, they will be converted 
to Open Directory authentication during importing.

7 Managing Directory Access
You can use Directory Access to set up and manage how 
a computer with Mac OS X or a server with Mac OS X 
Server accesses directory services and discovers network 
services.
For setup and management task descriptions and instructions, see:
• “Setting Up Services in Directory Access” on page 83
• “Setting Up the Authentication and Contacts Search Policies” on page 87
• “Accessing LDAP Directories” on page 90
• “Accessing an Active Directory Domain” on page 100
• “Accessing an NIS Domain” on page 107
• “Using BSD Configuration Files” on page 108
• “Accessing Legacy NetInfo Domains” on page 109
• “Setting Up Directory Access on a Remote Server” on page 113
Setting Up Services in Directory Access
Directory Access lists the different kinds of services that Mac OS X can access. The list 
includes directory services, which give Mac OS X access to user information and other 
administrative data stored in directory domains. The list also includes kinds of network 
services that Mac OS X can discover on the network. 
You can enable or disable access to each kind of service. If you disable a kind of service 
in Directory Access, Mac OS X no longer accesses services of the disabled kind. 
However, disabling a kind of service in Directory Access does not affect the ability of 
Mac OS X to use or provide services of that kind. For example, if you disable 
Rendezvous, Mac OS X does not use it to discover file services, but you can still share 
your files and connect to a file server if you know its address.

Chapter 7    Managing Directory Access
Enabling or Disabling Active Directory Service
You can use Directory Access to enable or disable the use of Active Directory on a 
Windows server. Active Directory is the directory service of Windows 2000 and 2003 
servers. 
To enable or disable access to Active Directory:
1 In Directory Access, click Services.
2 If the lock icon is locked, click it and type the name and password of an administrator.
3 Click the checkbox next to Active Directory and click Apply.
For configuration instructions, see “Accessing LDAP Directories” on page 90.
Enabling or Disabling AppleTalk Service Discovery
You can use Directory Access to enable or disable the discovery of AppleTalk network 
services. AppleTalk is a legacy Mac OS protocol for network file and print services. Some 
computers use AppleTalk to share files, and some servers use AppleTalk for file service. 
In addition, some shared printers use AppleTalk.
To enable or disable AppleTalk service discovery:
1 In Directory Access, click Services.
2 If the lock icon is locked, click it and type the name and password of an administrator.
3 Click the checkbox next to AppleTalk and click Apply.
AppleTalk does not require configuration.
Enabling or Disabling BSD Flat File and NIS Directory Services
You can use Directory Access to enable or disable the use of BSD configuration files 
and access to Network Information Service (NIS) directory services. BSD configuration
