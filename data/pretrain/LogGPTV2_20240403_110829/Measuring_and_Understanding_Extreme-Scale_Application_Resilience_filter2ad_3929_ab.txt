## Job and Application Exit Status
When a batch job exits, the Torque server generates an "Exit" (E) record in its log. This record captures the exit code of the last command run in the script. A job can finish successfully even if all its applications terminate abnormally. This paper focuses on application exit codes to understand the impact of system errors on user computations.

### Blue Waters Workload
The Blue Waters supercomputer processes large-scale scientific simulations across various fields. The following are representative applications:

### Data Sources
The dataset includes 517 days of data from 2013-03-01 to 2014-07-31, with 738,102 jobs launched by 913 users in 131 different research projects. The total node hours used were 198,112,165.

- **Syslogs**: System events, facility, severity level, node identification, process PID, and event description.
- **Alps Logs**: Node reservation management, job/application launching, monitoring, and termination.
- **Torque Logs**: Job creation, cancellation, scheduling, execution, and termination times, user, group, queue, resources, type, and wall time used.

## Example of Errors Impacting Applications
A real failure scenario in Blue Waters highlights the impact of a voltage regulator failure due to bad cooling, leading to a cabinet Emergency Power-Off (EPO). This failure caused a network failover, file system issues, and ultimately a system-wide outage. The detailed chain of events is as follows:

1. **Voltage Regulator Failure** → **Cabinet EPO** → **Network Failover** → **BMC Inconsistency** → **File System Failover** → **Job Scheduler Slowness** → **Application Suspensions** → **System Console Unresponsiveness** → **HSN Throttle** → **System Reboot**.

## LogDiver Measurement Tool
LogDiver is a tool developed to preprocess data logs and analyze system errors and failures. It is designed for Cray architecture but can be extended to other systems. Key features include:

- **Relating System Errors to Application Failures**: Directly linking Gemini ECC errors, GPU MMU errors, and Lustre file system failures to application failures.
- **Unified Representation**: Providing a unified representation of workload, error, and failure logs for analysis.

### LogDiver Operation Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Collects data from multiple sources, parsed into a system-agnostic format.
2. **Creation of Event Templates and Data Filtering**: Identifies unique templates of log entries and categorizes error event templates.
3. **Workload Consolidation**: Consolidates Torque and Alps logs into a consolidated dataset.
4. **Workload-Error Matching**: Evaluates estimators, computes correlation metrics, and groups errors with high correlation in a time window.

### Metrics Estimation
- **MTBI, MNBF**: Mean Time Between Interruptions, Mean Number of Bits Flipped
- **Node Hours, Duration, Scale**
- **Probability of Failure**

This comprehensive approach ensures a robust understanding of the impact of system errors on user computations and guides the design of resiliency mechanisms.
