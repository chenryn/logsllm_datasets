User: How to set static IP address and default gateway in Linux system?
Assistant: Setting a static IP address and default gateway in a Linux system can be done through the following steps: 1. Open a terminal and log in with root privileges. 2. Open the network configuration file, such as /etc/network/interfaces or /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0. 3. Add the following lines to the end of the file: ``` auto eth0 iface eth0 inet static address 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 ``` where eth0 is your network interface name, change it according to the actual situation . The static IP address is 192.168.1.100, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the default gateway is 192.168.1.1. 4. Save and close the file, then restart the network service: ``` service network restart ``` or ``` systemctl restart network ``` 5. Verify that the static IP address and default gateway were set successfully, by running the following Command to confirm: ``` ifconfig route -n ``` If the displayed IP address and gateway are consistent with your settings, it means that you have successfully set the static IP address and default gateway.
