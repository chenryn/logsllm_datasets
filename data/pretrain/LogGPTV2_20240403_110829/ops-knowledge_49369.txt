User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Receiving MAIL FROM: I've been looking into an issue with Exchange where our exchange server seems to be used as a relay for spam. 

It is set up to only allow our domain to be able to send out emails which when I've tried to telnet and manually run the SMTP commands seem to work. 

However, looking through the logs there is some weird emails that I can see are trying to send spam via us but the MAIL FROM: is just set to &lt;&gt; with a size parameter. 

Below is a screenshot:



Does anyone know how someone can send this, and how I can tell exchange to reject it.

Assistant: Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I think I have found the issue. It was related to the external relay on port 25 allowing everything to authenticate, such as Exchange User, Exchage Servers, TLS as well as anonymous. 

I believe from my very limited understanding of exchange that when exchange authenticated users are enabled, this automatically defaults to bypass exchanges antispam. 

I've turned all this off and only allow anonymous and only allow relaying for recipients with my domain and this has resolved the issue.
