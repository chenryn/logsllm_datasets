from 0.05 Mbps to 1 Mbps. Table 2 lists the loss rates at
link (r0, r1) for various bandwidths settings. No loss occurs
at other links. For all settings, the identiﬁcation procedure
accepts the null hypothesis that a strongly dominant con-
gested link exists. These identiﬁcation results are conﬁrmed
by Proposition 2.1. We further estimate an upper bound
on the maximum queuing delay of the strongly dominant
link, which is link (r0, r1). Table 2 lists the actual maxi-
mum queuing delay of link (r0, r1), and the estimates from
our approach and the loss pair approach. Estimates from
both approaches are close to the actual value in all the set-
tings: the maximum error from our approach and the loss
pair approach is 2 ms and 5 ms respectively.
We only describe one setting in Table 2 in detail. In this
setting, the bandwidth of link (r0, r1) is 1 Mbps. Fig. 6 plots
PMFs of the virtual queuing delay distributions from the
models (N = 1, 2) and the empirical virtual queuing delay
distribution. The various virtual queuing delay distributions
are very close1, demonstrating the accuracy of our model-
based approach. From Fig. 6, D = 5 is the minimum delay
such that FW (D) > 0. Since 2D = 10 > M = 5, we have
FW (2D) = 1. By Test 1, we accept the null hypothesis that
a strongly dominant congested link exists.
Fig. 6 also plots the virtual queuing delay distribution ob-
tained from the linear interpolation model. It deviates from
the empirical virtual queuing delay distribution and leads to
an underestimate of the maximum queuing delay. This in-
dicates the inaccuracy of the linear interpolation model. In
Fig. 6, the observed queuing delay distribution diﬀers dra-
matically from the virtual queuing delay distribution. This
is because the virtual queuing delay consists of the maxi-

while the observed queuing delay does not have this prop-
erty. Our identiﬁcation method relies on the virtual queuing
delay distribution, which cannot be replaced by the observed
queuing delay distribution as shown by this example.
5.1.2 A weakly dominant congested link
We next investigate settings in which a weakly dominant
congested link exists. In particular, we set the parameters
such that losses occur only at link (r0, r1) and (r2, r3) and
the loss rate at one link is signiﬁcantly lower than that at
the other link. The buﬀer sizes at router r0, r1 and r2 are
25.6 Kb, 76.8 Kb and 25.6 Kb respectively. The link band-
width of (r1, r2) is 1 Mbps. The link bandwidths of (r0, r1)
and (r2, r3) with their corresponding loss rates are listed in
Table 3.
The null hypothesis is that there exists a weakly domi-
nant congested link with θ = 0.06 and φ = 0. That is, the
requirements on the weakly dominant congested link are: at
least 94% of the losses occur at this link; furthermore, when
a probe experiences the maximum queuing delay at this link,
100% of the time this queuing delay is no less than the ag-
gregate queuing delay that this probe experiences on the
other links. The identiﬁcation procedure accepts the null
hypothesis for all the settings. These identiﬁcation results
are conﬁrmed by Proposition 2.2.
We estimate an upper bound on the maximum queuing
delay at the weakly dominant congested link, which is link
(r2, r3). Table 3 lists the actual maximum queuing delay of
link (r2, r3), and the estimates from our approach and the
loss pair approach. The estimates from our approach are
much closer to the actual value (with a maximum error of
9 ms) than those from the loss pair approach (with a maxi-
mum error of 100 ms). The reason for the deviation from the
loss pair approach might be that this approach is sensitive to
the queuing delays at links other than the weakly dominant
congested link and/or requires longer probing durations.
We next describe one setting in Table 3 in detail. In this
setting, the bandwidths of link (r0, r1) and (r2, r3) are 0.7
Mbps and 0.2 Mbps respectively. The average loss rates on
link (r2, r3) is 3.8%, which accounts for 95% of the losses.
Fig. 7 plots the distributions of the virtual queuing delays
obtained empirically and from the various models. The
various virtual queuing delay distributions are very simi-
lar. From Fig. 7, D = 1 is the minimum delay such that
FW (D) > 0, which is around 0.01 and not quite observable
from the ﬁgure. Since FW (2D) = FW (2) = 0.02  θ. Since 2D = 8 > M = 5, we have
FW (2D) = 1. By Test 2, we accept the hypothesis that there
exists a weakly dominant congested link with θ = 0.06 and
φ = 0. When using θ = 0.02 and φ = 0 as the parameters
for the null hypothesis, the identiﬁcation procedure rejects
the hypothesis, which is correct since no link in this setting
is responsible for more than 98% of the loss.
We use M = 40 and N = 1 to estimate an upper bound
of the maximum queuing delay at the weakly dominant con-
gested link, which is link (r2, r3). The PMF of the virtual
queuing delay is shown in Fig. 8. According to the heuris-
tic described in Section 3.3, the connected component with
most of the mass (i.e., the one in the right of the ﬁgure)
corresponds to the virtual queuing delay from the weakly
dominant congested link. From Fig. 8, D = 30 is the mini-
mum delay that is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0. The queu-
ing delay ranges from 0 to 171 ms. Therefore, an upper
bound on the maximum queuing delay at link (r2, r3) is
30/40 ∗ 171 = 128 ms, which is the same as the actual max-
imum queuing delay.

such that losses occur at links (r0, r1) and (r2, r3) and the
loss rates at the two links are comparable. The buﬀer size
at routers r0, r1 and r2 are 25.6 Kb, 128 Kb and 25.6 Kb
respectively. The link bandwidth of (r1, r2) is 1 Mbps. The
link bandwidths of (r0, r1) and (r2, r3) are varied, as listed
in Table 4. The loss rates at links (r0, r1) and (r2, r3) in
each setting are comparable, as shown in Table 4. The null
hypothesis is that there exists a weakly dominant congested
link with θ = 0.03 and φ = 0. For all settings, the identiﬁ-
cation procedure rejects the hypothesis.
We describe one setting in detail.
In this setting, the
bandwidths of link (r0, r1) and r2, r3) are 0.1 Mbps and 0.2
Mbps respectively. The average loss rates on link (r0, r1)

and (r2, r3) are similar (2.3% and 2.0% respectively). We
therefore have two lossy links and no dominant congested
link. Fig. 9(a) also shows that the virtual queuing delay dis-
tributions obtained empirically and from the various models
are very close. For θ = 0.03 and φ = 0, D = 2 is the min-
imum delay such that FW (D) > θ. However FW (2D) =
FW (4) = 0.58 < (1 − θ)(1 − φ) = 0.97. We therefore con-
clude that there is no weakly dominant congested link with
θ = 0.03 and φ = 0. Of course, there is no weakly dominant
congested link with lower values of θ and φ either.
Fig. 9(b) plots the virtual queuing delay distributions ob-
tained empirically and from HMMs in this setting. The
virtual queuing delay distributions from the various HMMs
are diﬀerent and deviate from the empirical distribution, in-
dicating that the distributions from HMMs are sensitive to
the parameters and do not match the empirical result. Note
that even for a large value of N (N = 10), the virtual queu-
ing delay distributions from the HMM still diﬀers from the
empirical distribution.
