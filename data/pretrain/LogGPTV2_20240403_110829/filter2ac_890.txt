**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

To enhance security, it is essential to restrict the ability of users and user groups to create tokens. This setting should be specifically configured for the local system account. 

### Steps to Implement:

1. **Restrict Token Creation:**
   - **Group Policy Object (GPO) Path:** 
     - `Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Create a token object`
   - **Configuration:**
     - Ensure that only the local system account has the permission to create a token object.

2. **Restrict Process-Level Token Replacement:**
   - **GPO Path:**
     - `Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Replace a process level token`
   - **Configuration:**
     - Limit this permission to the local and network service accounts.

3. **Administrator Best Practices:**
   - Administrators should log in as standard users but use the built-in `runas` command to execute tools with administrator privileges. This approach leverages access token manipulation to ensure that administrative tasks are performed with the necessary permissions while minimizing the risk of privilege abuse.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage privileged accounts and reduce the risk of unauthorized token creation and manipulation.
