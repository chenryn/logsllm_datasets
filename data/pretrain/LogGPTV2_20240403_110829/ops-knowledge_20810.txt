User: Currently, I’ve scheduled a python script on Linux by adding the following: */10 * * * * /file/testscripts/test_script.py to crontab -e. 
It did not run after 10 minutes, so I wrote some code to write the current time on there but wasn’t being updated either. 
What could be the issue? And how can I determine my python script has been scheduled for a cron job properly? 
Thank you in advance and will accept/upvote answer
Assistant: Try with 10 * * * * yourscript name.Then check if crontab -l is include  your script. Then you can check crontab logs.
