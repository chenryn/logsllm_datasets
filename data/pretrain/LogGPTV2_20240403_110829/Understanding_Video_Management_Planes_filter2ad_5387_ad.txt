for specific protocols).
Measures of management complexity. Each of these tasks has an
associated complexity that depends on the three components we
study (protocols, CDNs, and devices). We list below complexity
measures for video management, motivated in part by prior work on
quantifying complexity in other domains such as web page complex-
ity [51], and router configuration complexity [50]. Other measures
are possible, and we have left an extended exploration to future
work.
Management plane combinations. One measure of complexity
is the number of unique combinations of CDN, streaming protocol,
and the end user‚Äôs device that a publisher supports. This relates to
the complexity of triaging failures. A failure can be caused by one
of the components (e.g., CDN or protocol), an interaction between
two components (e.g., a specific CDN‚Äôs implementation of HLS), or
an interaction across all three components (e.g., we have observed a
failure caused by the interaction between a Chromecast implementa-
tion using SmoothStreaming on a specific CDN). In the worst case,
it might be necessary to examine all combinations to triage a failure.
Indeed, Conviva, triages failures automatically by aggregating fail-
ure reports across all management plane combinations [10]. More
broadly, failure triaging may also depend on other factors such as
the choice of ISP which we do not consider in this paper.
Protocol-titles. The product of protocols used by a publisher and
the number of unique video IDs (or video titles) for a publisher
captures the packaging costs for the publisher‚Äôs content7. Intuitively,
each publisher has to package each video separately for each pro-
tocol. This measure determines the compute and storage resources
needed to package the publisher‚Äôs contents and can impact the lag
experienced by users for live content.
Unique SDKs. Defined as the number of unique versions of SDKs
and browsers supported by a publisher across all devices, this mea-
sure captures the software development and maintenance complexity.
The metric may also relate to the complexity of triaging a failure
related to the device, if the failure is specific to an SDK version or
browser.
Correlation between management complexity and publisher
view-hours. Fig. 13(a) presents a scatter plot that shows how the
management plane combinations metric (on a log scale) correlates
with the view-hours (on a log-scale) served by the publisher. We

video, which we do not have.

owners syndicate their content to almost 1
3 rd of all full syndicators.
These numbers are conservative, since we do not have coverage of all
the syndicators, and since we have not considered partial syndication.
Overall, these numbers suggest that content syndication is significant
in online video delivery.
Incorporating syndication in management planes. Today,
because each publisher runs an independent management plane
instance, the easiest way to syndicate content is that the content
owner provides a master or "mezzanine" copy of the content to each
of its syndicators which then packages and distributes the content
through its video management plane.
In this independent syndication model, sub-optimal outcomes
might result because syndicators can make independent decisions
on video packaging choices. In this paper, we illustrate two such
outcomes to motivate why it is important to study video management
planes: (a) different performance for the same syndicated content
resulting from different bitrate choices; (b) redundancy in CDN
storage usage because multiple copies of the same content can be
stored on a CDN using different encodings or protocols.
To quantify these, we focus on a popular video catalogue that has
10 syndicators. We focus on a single video ID from the catalogue
because the bitrates used to encode different videos may vary based
on the content [38].
Bitrate choices for syndicated content. As described before, bi-
trate choices decide, for each platform, the resolutions and qualities
at which the video is available. With independent syndication, an
owner and a syndicator can make different bitrate choices for the
same video ID. For each video ID there is associated information
about the audio and video bitrates used in the encoding, as well as
other information such as the duration of each chunk. In general,
each publisher may have different set of bitrates for the same video
ID based on factors such as the streaming protocol, type of device,

also add a line of best fit using linear regression. The slope of the
line shows that when the view-hours increase by a factor of 10, the
number of management plane combinations increases by a factor of
1.72√ó, indicating a sub-linear growth in complexity with publisher
size.
Fig. 13(b) and Fig. 13(c) respectively show similar scatter plots
and lines of best fit for both the Protocol-titles metric, and the
Unique SDKs metric. Again, both graphs indicate that the complexity
measures increase sub-linearly with publisher view-hours: when
view-hours increase by an order of magnitude the Protocol-titles
grows by 3.8√ó, while the Unique SDKs metric grows by 1.8√ó with
the biggest publishers having to maintain up to 85 different code
bases.

In each case, the linear fit is statistically significant, with ùëù-values
6 MANAGEMENT OF SYNDICATION
We next explore how today‚Äôs structure of management planes, where
each publisher makes independent decisions on the choice of pro-
tocols, CDNs and playback devices, can result in sub-optimal per-
formance when content is syndicated. Syndicators license and serve
content obtained from multiple content owners. Conversely, content
owners may distribute their content through multiple syndicators.
The prevalence of syndication. For each publisher-ID-video-ID
pair, a flag specifies whether the content is owned or syndicated. With
this, we can determine, for a given content owner, what fraction of
full syndicators have syndicated that owner‚Äôs content. Fig. 14 shows
the CDF of the percentage of syndicators used by each content owner.
The figure shows that syndication is prevalent ‚Äì more than 80% of
content owners use at least one syndicator, and 20% of content

and network connectivity (WiFi, 4G, Wired). For fair comparison,
we compare the bitrates served to the same type of device over the
same type of Internet connection (WiFi, 4G, Wired).
Bitrate choices can vary widely. Fig. 17 shows the bitrates used
by the syndicators (S1 to S10), as well as the bitrates offered by the
original content owner (O) for iPad devices over a WiFi network.
The figure shows a significant difference both in the number of
bitrates, the range of bitrates, and individual bitrate choices. At
one extreme, S2 encodes the video into only 3 different bitrates,
while at the other end, S9 employs 14 bitrates. The owner uses 9
different bitrates and offers a bitrate that exceeds 8192 Kbps, while
the highest bitrate offered by S1 is 7x lower and only a little above
1024 Kbps. We have also performed a similar comparison for other
device types, and observed similar heterogeneity in bitrate decisions
made by the content owner and various syndicators.
Bitrate choices can impact performance. We also study the per-
formance achieved by clients of some of these syndicators. Two
widely used measures of video delivery performance are the average
bitrate of each view, and the rebuffering ratio (the fraction of the
view that experiences rebuffering) [49, 57].
Fig. 15 shows the distribution of average bitrates observed by
iPad clients of a syndicator (S7 in Fig. 17) and the owner, for our
selected video ID, across two different ISP/CDN combinations in
March 2018. Further, we restricted the geo-location of clients to
California, USA. Consistently, the content owner‚Äôs clients get much
better average bitrates: at the median, the average bitrate of the
owner‚Äôs clients is 2.5√ó that of the syndicator. Interestingly, clients
of the owner also perceive lower rebuffering ratios (Fig. 16), with
almost 40% lower rebuffering at the 90-th percentile. We observed
similar results for other device, ISP and CDN combinations.

ular catalogue by the owner and ten syndicators.

Figure 18: Storage savings under different syndication models
for content served by an owner and two syndicators.
While we cannot comprehensively answer why syndicators select
widely varying bitrates, our hypothesis is that the owner selected its
bitrates to provide better experience for its users, while the syndi-
cator‚Äôs choices were dictated in part by the increased storage and
encoding costs required for higher bitrates.
Redundancy in CDN storage. Independent syndication can also
result in redundant storage in CDNs. In this section, we explore
this for a popular video catalogue syndicated by two syndicators
from the owner. In this case, the owner stores the catalogue on two
CDNs ùê¥ and ùêµ, and uses 9 bitrates. One of its syndicators stores
the same catalogue on 3 CDNs ùê¥, ùêµ and ùê∂, but encodes the videos
using 7 bitrates. Another syndicator stores the catalogue on ùê¥, ùêµ
and another CDN ùê∑, but encodes the videos using 14 different
bitrates. These different management choices for the same content
arise largely because of the independent syndication model.
We focus on a setting where publishers proactively push video
content to a CDN origin server which serves cache misses from
CDN edge servers [64]. This setting is commonly used in practice,
especially for popular video content. We quantify the redundancy
in storage in CDN origin servers. While there is likely some
redundancy in edge servers as well, this is harder to quantify as that
depends on content access patterns.
Quantifying storage redundancy with independent syndication.
To quantify redundant storage, we first compute the total storage
required for the entire catalogue. We do this by (i) multiplying for
each video ID, its encoded bitrates by its duration in seconds, and
summing these products to obtain storage per video ID and (ii) by
summing the storage per video ID across all videos in the catalogue
to obtain the total catalogue storage. This results in a total storage
requirement of 1916 TB across the 3 publishers (content owner and
two syndicators) for each of the common CDNs (ùê¥ and ùêµ).
We next explore the storage savings achievable for this catalogue
if a CDN removes redundant copies of chunks with the same, or
similar bitrates (those within a small tolerance factor). This is
motivated by the observation that the syndicators and content owners
often have similar or identical bitrates (Fig. 17). This occurs in
practice because, even though publishers make independent bitrate
choices, they tend to follow guidelines recommended by streaming
protocol specifications. For example,
the HLS specifications
recommend that publishers make available at least one bitrate under
192 Kbps and that each successive bitrate be within a multiplicative
factor of 1.5-2√ó of the previous [6].
Fig. 18 (left three bars) shows the absolute and percentage storage
savings with the above model. Even with a 5% tolerance, CDNs ùê¥
IMC ‚Äô18, October 31-November 2, 2018, Boston, MA, USA
Z. Akhtar et al.
and ùêµ can save 316.1 TBs (16.5%) each, and at 10%, they can each
save 865 TBs (45.2%).
Integrated syndication. Another form of syndication is what can
be called integrated syndication, in which the owner‚Äôs content deliv-
ery mechanism is integrated into the syndicator‚Äôs playback software.
There are two variants of integrated syndication: (i) API integration,
where the syndicator uses the owner‚Äôs manifest file and CDN; and
(ii) app integration, where the syndicator embeds the owner‚Äôs app
into its own.
The rightmost bar of Fig. 18 shows that with integrated syndica-
tion, ùê¥ and ùêµ each save 1257 TB (65.6%). In addition, especially
with app integration, syndicators cannot choose different bitrates
than content owners, so performance differences similar to Fig. 15
are unlikely to arise.
While integrated syndication has potential, many logistical chal-
lenges must be addressed to make it a reality. For instance, with app
integration, syndicators have to integrate apps for every owner they
syndicate from. While API integration is potentially logistically eas-
ier, accounting mechanisms must be developed to distinguish CDN
usage by clients of the syndicator and the owner. Future work should
explore better ways to improve the management of syndication.
7 RELATED WORK
Characterizing Video Services. YouTube and Netflix alone have
been the subject of numerous studies over the years [45, 46, 52, 53,
55, 56, 59, 63, 77, 81, 82]. This body of work has studied several
aspects, including 1) architecture, serving strategy and its evolution,
2) characterization of videos in terms of encoded bitrates, total
number of videos, popularity, caching, and 3) the user access patterns
and quality of experience etc. Ghasemi et al. [62] conducted an
in-depth study of Yahoo‚Äôs video serving infrastructure to reveal
problems in different points in the video delivery pipeline. Other
work has also examined different types of video services including
a Pay-TV [44], cellular video [58], an on-demand service [70] and
user-generated live streaming services [75, 78]. These papers focus
on one or a handful of online publishers, but our work focuses on
characterizing management plane practices across a large number of
online video publishers.
Industry surveys. Because of the growing interest in Internet video,
several industry surveys [13, 22, 37, 41] have examined the video
ecosystem. A 2017 industry study by Bitmovin surveyed 380 video
developers (individuals or companies associated with the Internet
video business in various ways). This study characterized streaming
protocols, encoding formats, devices, DRM etc.. An earlier 2016
study [13] characterized aggregate distributions across many of the
same dimensions as [41]. Another prior industry survey [18] and an
anecdotal report [26] discuss the percentage of publishers that use
multiple CDNs (but do not discuss the number of CDNs used, or the
fact different CDNs may be used for live and VoD). While valuable,
none of these reports weigh findings by view-hours, or present
trends across publishers categorized by view-hours, or present
longitudinal analyses, as we do. Both of these methodological
differences result in new findings and add insights to known trends.
