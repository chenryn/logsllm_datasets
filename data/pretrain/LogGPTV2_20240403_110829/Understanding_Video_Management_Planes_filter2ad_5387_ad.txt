### Measures of Management Complexity

Each task in video management is associated with a certain level of complexity, which is influenced by the three components we study: protocols, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and devices. Below, we list several measures of complexity for video management, drawing on prior work that quantifies complexity in other domains, such as web page complexity [51] and router configuration complexity [50]. While other measures are possible, an extended exploration is left for future work.

#### Management Plane Combinations
One measure of complexity is the number of unique combinations of CDN, streaming protocol, and end user's device that a publisher supports. This metric is crucial for understanding the complexity involved in triaging failures. A failure can be caused by one component (e.g., CDN or protocol), an interaction between two components (e.g., a specific CDN’s implementation of HLS), or an interaction across all three components (e.g., a failure observed due to the interaction between a Chromecast implementation using SmoothStreaming on a specific CDN). In the worst case, it may be necessary to examine all combinations to triage a failure. For example, Conviva automates failure triaging by aggregating failure reports across all management plane combinations [10]. More broadly, failure triaging may also depend on other factors, such as the choice of Internet Service Provider (ISP), which we do not consider in this paper.

#### Protocol-Titles
The product of the number of protocols used by a publisher and the number of unique video IDs (or video titles) captures the packaging costs for the publisher’s content. Each publisher must package each video separately for each protocol, which determines the compute and storage resources needed. This measure can also impact the lag experienced by users for live content.

#### Unique SDKs
Defined as the number of unique versions of Software Development Kits (SDKs) and browsers supported by a publisher across all devices, this measure captures the software development and maintenance complexity. It may also relate to the complexity of triaging a failure related to the device, especially if the failure is specific to an SDK version or browser.

### Correlation Between Management Complexity and Publisher View-Hours

Figure 13(a) presents a scatter plot showing how the management plane combinations metric (on a log scale) correlates with the view-hours (on a log scale) served by the publisher. The slope of the line indicates that when view-hours increase by a factor of 10, the number of management plane combinations increases by a factor of 1.72×, indicating a sub-linear growth in complexity with publisher size.

Figures 13(b) and 13(c) show similar scatter plots and lines of best fit for the Protocol-titles and Unique SDKs metrics, respectively. Both graphs indicate that the complexity measures increase sub-linearly with publisher view-hours: when view-hours increase by an order of magnitude, the Protocol-titles grow by 3.8×, while the Unique SDKs metric grows by 1.8×, with the largest publishers having to maintain up to 85 different code bases. In each case, the linear fit is statistically significant, with \( p \)-values at the 0.05 level of significance smaller than \( 10^{-9} \).

### Management of Syndication

We explore how the current structure of management planes, where each publisher makes independent decisions on the choice of protocols, CDNs, and playback devices, can result in sub-optimal performance when content is syndicated. Syndicators license and serve content obtained from multiple content owners, and content owners may distribute their content through multiple syndicators.

#### Prevalence of Syndication
For each publisher-ID-video-ID pair, a flag specifies whether the content is owned or syndicated. This allows us to determine, for a given content owner, what fraction of full syndicators have syndicated that owner’s content. Figure 14 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the percentage of syndicators used by each content owner. The figure indicates that syndication is prevalent, with more than 80% of content owners using at least one syndicator, and 20% of content owners syndicating to almost one-third of all full syndicators. These numbers are conservative, as we do not have coverage of all syndicators and have not considered partial syndication.

#### Independent Syndication Model
In the independent syndication model, each publisher runs an independent management plane instance. The content owner provides a master or "mezzanine" copy of the content to each of its syndicators, which then packages and distributes the content through its video management plane. This model can lead to sub-optimal outcomes because syndicators can make independent decisions on video packaging choices. We illustrate two such outcomes:
- **Different Performance for the Same Syndicated Content:** Different bitrate choices can result in varying performance.
- **Redundancy in CDN Storage Usage:** Multiple copies of the same content can be stored on a CDN using different encodings or protocols.

To quantify these, we focus on a popular video catalogue with 10 syndicators and a single video ID. The bitrates used to encode different videos may vary based on the content [38].

#### Bitrate Choices for Syndicated Content
Bitrate choices determine the resolutions and qualities at which the video is available. With independent syndication, an owner and a syndicator can make different bitrate choices for the same video ID. Each publisher may have a different set of bitrates for the same video ID based on factors such as the streaming protocol, type of device, and network connectivity (WiFi, 4G, Wired).

Figure 17 shows the bitrates used by the syndicators (S1 to S10) and the original content owner (O) for iPad devices over a WiFi network. There is a significant difference in the number of bitrates, the range of bitrates, and individual bitrate choices. For example, S2 encodes the video into only 3 different bitrates, while S9 uses 14 bitrates. The owner uses 9 different bitrates and offers a bitrate exceeding 8192 Kbps, while the highest bitrate offered by S1 is 7x lower, just above 1024 Kbps.

#### Impact of Bitrate Choices on Performance
We study the performance achieved by clients of some of these syndicators. Two widely used measures of video delivery performance are the average bitrate of each view and the rebuffering ratio (the fraction of the view that experiences rebuffering) [49, 57].

Figure 15 shows the distribution of average bitrates observed by iPad clients of a syndicator (S7 in Fig. 17) and the owner, for our selected video ID, across two different ISP/CDN combinations in March 2018. Clients of the owner consistently get much better average bitrates: at the median, the average bitrate of the owner’s clients is 2.5× that of the syndicator. Additionally, clients of the owner perceive lower rebuffering ratios (Fig. 16), with almost 40% lower rebuffering at the 90th percentile. Similar results were observed for other device, ISP, and CDN combinations.

#### Redundancy in CDN Storage
Independent syndication can also result in redundant storage in CDNs. We explore this for a popular video catalogue syndicated by two syndicators from the owner. The owner stores the catalogue on two CDNs (A and B) and uses 9 bitrates. One syndicator stores the same catalogue on 3 CDNs (A, B, and C) but encodes the videos using 7 bitrates. Another syndicator stores the catalogue on A, B, and another CDN (D) but encodes the videos using 14 different bitrates.

We focus on a setting where publishers proactively push video content to a CDN origin server, which serves cache misses from CDN edge servers [64]. We quantify the redundancy in storage in CDN origin servers. The total storage requirement for the entire catalogue is 1916 TB across the 3 publishers (content owner and two syndicators) for each of the common CDNs (A and B).

Figure 18 (left three bars) shows the absolute and percentage storage savings achievable if a CDN removes redundant copies of chunks with the same or similar bitrates (within a small tolerance factor). Even with a 5% tolerance, CDNs A and B can save 316.1 TBs (16.5%) each, and at 10%, they can each save 865 TBs (45.2%).

#### Integrated Syndication
Another form of syndication is integrated syndication, where the owner’s content delivery mechanism is integrated into the syndicator’s playback software. There are two variants:
- **API Integration:** The syndicator uses the owner’s manifest file and CDN.
- **App Integration:** The syndicator embeds the owner’s app into its own.

Figure 18 (rightmost bar) shows that with integrated syndication, A and B each save 1257 TB (65.6%). Additionally, with app integration, syndicators cannot choose different bitrates than content owners, so performance differences similar to Fig. 15 are unlikely to arise.

While integrated syndication has potential, many logistical challenges must be addressed to make it a reality. For instance, with app integration, syndicators must integrate apps for every owner they syndicate from. With API integration, accounting mechanisms must be developed to distinguish CDN usage by clients of the syndicator and the owner. Future work should explore better ways to improve the management of syndication.

#### Characterizing Video Services
YouTube and Netflix have been the subject of numerous studies over the years [45, 46, 52, 53, 55, 56, 59, 63, 77, 81, 82]. These studies have examined various aspects, including architecture, serving strategy, video characterization, and user access patterns. Ghasemi et al. [62] conducted an in-depth study of Yahoo’s video serving infrastructure, revealing problems in different points in the video delivery pipeline. Other work has examined different types of video services, including Pay-TV [44], cellular video [58], on-demand service [70], and user-generated live streaming services [75, 78]. Our work focuses on characterizing management plane practices across a large number of online video publishers.

#### Industry Surveys
Several industry surveys [13, 22, 37, 41] have examined the video ecosystem. A 2017 industry study by Bitmovin surveyed 380 video developers, characterizing streaming protocols, encoding formats, devices, and Digital Rights Management (DRM). An earlier 2016 study [13] characterized aggregate distributions across many of the same dimensions. Another prior industry survey [18] and an anecdotal report [26] discuss the percentage of publishers that use multiple CDNs but do not discuss the number of CDNs used or the fact that different CDNs may be used for live and VoD. While valuable, none of these reports weigh findings by view-hours, present trends across publishers categorized by view-hours, or present longitudinal analyses, as we do. These methodological differences result in new findings and add insights to known trends.
