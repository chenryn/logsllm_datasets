ABSTRACT
Possession of modern smartphones is becoming increasingly
ubiquitous, and with this rise in usage comes a rise in the
amount of sensitive data being stored on them. Despite
this, the high-frequency, low-duration nature of the average
smartphone session makes passwords or PIN-locks even less
usable than in the desktop context. To combat these issues,
implicit authentication (IA) schemes can be developed and
deployed to smartphones. IA schemes continuously authen-
ticate users by proﬁling their behaviour using the variety of
sensors prevalent on the phones, such as touchscreens and
accelerometers. When a non-owner acquires the device and
attempts to access sensitive data on it, the IA scheme recog-
nizes the diﬀerence in behaviour and automatically ejects the
attacker from the system. In particularly sensitive contexts,
IA schemes can also be deployed as a secondary defence
mechanism on top of explicit authentication, providing lay-
ered security in the event of, for example, a shoulder-surﬁng
attack compromising the device’s PIN or an operating sys-
tem vulnerability allowing its bypass.
In this work, we evaluate existing proposals for IA schemes
using diﬀerent behavioural feature sets, and evaluate them
against real-world data to show when they are (and are not)
useful. We have implemented them in an easily extensible
open source framework for the Android operating system
called Itus, which allows other researchers to iteratively im-
prove on the existing mechanisms for performing IA. Itus
performs IA at the app level, which we have shown allows
app developers to selectively protect sensitive data while de-
creasing the impact on battery life and device performance,
and at the same time obtaining better detection accuracy
for the IA scheme being invoked.

INTRODUCTION
The increasing ubiquity of modern smartphones and other
ultra-portable computing devices has resulted in more sen-
sitive data being carried on the person than ever before.
Such data can range anywhere from personal photos and
text messages to conﬁdential company records or communi-
cations. Thus the need to protect these smartphones from
unauthorized access grows in proportion with their preva-
lence. However, research into ordinary lock screens is con-
sistently ﬁnding that simple password protection schemes
impose signiﬁcant usability issues upon their users [1, 10],
and in the smartphone domain these issues result in more
than half of users choosing to forego any sort of PIN or
passlock on their phones whatsoever [13].
One solution to these usability issues is to authenticate
users continuously as they use the device, without explicit
prompts for them to provide secrets or other extra input.
Such schemes are known as implicit authentication, or IA. IA
schemes operate by measuring the users’ normal interactions
with the smartphone—for example, using the touchscreen
to measure how hard they swipe, or the accelerometer to
proﬁle how steadily they hold their device—and comparing
the observation with a previously learned model of the users’
behaviour. If an unauthorized user attempts to interact with
the device, their behavioural proﬁle should not match that
of the owner and the IA scheme will proceed to eject the
(potentially malicious) user from the system.
Although there are many proposals that demonstrate pro-
mising approaches to performing IA on smartphones, none
of these approaches has yet been commonly adopted for ev-
eryday use. We argue that this is due to a combination of
factors: (i) it is not yet clear which behavioural features and
classiﬁcation algorithms result in the best accuracy while
also being measurable often enough to be useful; (ii) proﬁles
of actual users’ everyday device usage are not easy to obtain
in order to measure usability and performance in realistic
scenarios; and (iii) there is no existing, extensible IA frame-
work for IA scheme developers to contribute to in order to
iteratively develop a strong IA implementation. We aim to
address these issues by comparing a representative mix of
proposed behavioural feature sets against each other using
real-world user data, which in turn allows us to evaluate
existing metrics for comparing IA schemes and to propose
new useful metrics, and then redeploying these schemes in
1415an open source IA framework for Android smartphones that
can be extended in an iterative manner.
2. PREVIOUS WORK
Existing literature contains a number of diﬀering propos-
als for performing implicit authentication on smartphones [3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16].These proposed IA schemes use
sensors on the device to proﬁle behavioural features includ-
ing touchscreen input, typing input, accelerometer readings,
GPS positioning, call and text logs histories, and device
application contexts. Despite having reasonable detection
accuracies and acceptable performance overhead in their re-
spective proposals, however, it is diﬃcult to compare these
schemes to each other as they are not evaluated across com-
mon data sets, and often the results can change signiﬁcantly
when compared in such a way [6].
In previous work, we argued that performing IA at the
platform level places inherent limitations on the scheme’s
performance ability and usability [11]. When deployed at
the app level, the IA scheme is able to decide when and how
to authenticate smartphone users. In particular, the app is
able to decide whether the current context should be consid-
ered sensitive or not, thus avoiding an “all-or-nothing” access
model that has been shown to dissuade users from making
use of authentication mechanisms [10]. The app is also bet-
ter able to make decisions about which sensors should be
monitored for behavioural data, thus improving accuracy
and reducing the additional costs imposed on the device’s
CPU and battery life. As an example, consider a banking
app developed for smartphones. Although it allow access to
the owners’ account information, it might also have a “lo-
cate nearby ATM” feature that is not considered sensitive.
The owner of the smartphone might want to allow a friend
to use this feature, without the IA scheme locking the de-
vice on the friend for having a diﬀerent behavioural proﬁle.
It might also be aware that users tend to perform online
banking in a small number of geographic locations, and so
decide that it is worthwhile to turn on battery-heavy GPS
monitoring to aid implicit authentication.
3. CONTRIBUTIONS & RESULTS
3.1 Comparison of IA Schemes
We select and implement six proposals for IA schemes [2,
6, 7, 8, 9, 15] and evaluate them across a common pool
of data. Collectively, these IA schemes make use of vari-
ous combinations of behavioural features that include call /
text / URL history, location, gait patterns, touch input be-
haviour, keystroke behaviour, micro-movement behaviour,
and user context. As noted above, it is important not only
to use the same data for evaluation, but also to collect that
data from real-world user scenarios. To that end, we use
four data sets collected by instrumenting end-user Android
smartphones used by recruited study participants.
We will evaluate all six schemes against the following eight
metrics: accuracy, or the ratio of true accepts and true re-
jects the IA scheme obtains; data availability, or how of-
ten the requisite behavioural features are actually available
for classiﬁcation in real-world scenarios; training delay, or
how long it takes to build a behavioural proﬁle of the device
user; detection delay, or how long it takes on average for a
non-owner to be ejected from the device; processing com-

device; uniqueness, or how distinct a given collection of fea-
tures is to a user; vulnerability to mimicry, or how hard
it is to impersonate a user against a given set of behavioural
features; and ease of deployment, or how diﬃcult it is in
practice to collect and proﬁle a proposed IA scheme in the
context of a mobile device. Figure 1 shows our preliminary
results for the data availability metric evaluated against
the six IA schemes referenced above.

Implementation of IA Schemes

We are working on an open source IA framework for the

Itus is a library
Android operating system called Itus
that developers can add to their apps in order to obtain IA
protection in a simply and conﬁgurable manner. It is also
designed to be easily extensible, such that IA researchers
can drop-in new implementations of IA scheme proposals in
order to quickly deploy them for testing in real-world sce-
narios. We are also creating the Itus Oracle, a standalone
application that allows app developers to measure the usage
characteristics of their app and subsequently receive a rec-
ommendation of which IA scheme would work best for their
app. The Itus Oracle then packages these recommended
conﬁgurations into a small library which the developer can
then simply import to their Android app. Figure 2 shows
the proposed architecture for our IA framework.
We aim to have several smartphones running Itus available
for demonstration during the presentation of the poster.
4. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK
In this work, we show when and how smartphone users
can be implicitly authenticated. This is done by outlining a
comprehensive set of metrics, both new and old, for propos-
als of IA mechanisms to be evaluated against. We are eval-
uating six distinct IA schemes using our metrics on several
datasets collected from real-world scenarios. We are also in
the process of implementing Itus, an open source framework
for Android, and a variety of IA schemes on top of it. Itus
is designed to be easily extensible, allowing IA contributors
to easily add new IA schemes to the core distribution, or to
