Hi, allow me to ask for a question about Tensorflow feature:
Firstly, I uses the nearly-latest Tensorflow version v1.10 and the system has
NCCL 2.0 installed.
As is known that NCCL 2.0 has already supported Cross-Node multiple GPU
training with fully NCCL management, but I found that Tensorflow benchmark
script doesn't support NCCL in Tensorflow distributed mode, and it said NCCL
mode is only allowed and designed for in single-node mode, so I don't know
whether it is not supported by Tensorflow engine, or just not supported by the
Tensorflow benchmark script? If it is just not implemented by the Tensorflow
benchmark script, is there documentation or example to enable Distributed
Tensorflow to use NCCL 2.0 to manage cross-node Multi GPUs? Thanks.
