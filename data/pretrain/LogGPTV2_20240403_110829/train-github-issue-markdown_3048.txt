When attempting to run a cron job as the Elasticsearch (ES) user on CentOS 6, an issue may arise. This problem is particularly relevant when using the package from the repository. Below is a detailed description of the issue and the related system information:

1. **Switching to the ES User:**
   ```bash
   [centos@ip-10-233-237-10 ~]$ sudo su - elasticsearch -s /bin/bash
   ```
   This command attempts to switch to the `elasticsearch` user and start a bash shell. However, it results in the following warning:
   ```bash
   su: warning: cannot change directory to /home/elasticsearch: No such file or directory
   ```

2. **User Information:**
   To verify the details of the `elasticsearch` user, you can use the `grep` command to search the `/etc/passwd` file:
   ```bash
   -bash-4.1$ grep elasticsearch /etc/passwd
   elasticsearch:x:498:498:elasticsearch user:/home/elasticsearch:/sbin/nologin
   ```
   The output shows that the `elasticsearch` user's home directory is set to `/home/elasticsearch`, but the shell is set to `/sbin/nologin`, which means the user is not intended to log in interactively.

3. **Home Directory Verification:**
   To check if the `/home/elasticsearch` directory actually exists, you can list the contents of the `/home` directory:
   ```bash
   -bash-4.1$ ls -l /home/
   total 4
   drwx------. 3 centos centos 4096 Nov  2 20:23 centos
   ```
   The output indicates that the `/home/elasticsearch` directory does not exist, only the `/home/centos` directory is present.

### Summary
The issue arises because the `elasticsearch` user's home directory (`/home/elasticsearch`) does not exist, and the user is configured with `/sbin/nologin`, preventing interactive login. This can cause problems when trying to run cron jobs or other commands as the `elasticsearch` user.

### Solution
To resolve this issue, you can create the missing home directory for the `elasticsearch` user:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /home/elasticsearch
sudo chown elasticsearch:elasticsearch /home/elasticsearch
```
Alternatively, if the `elasticsearch` user does not need a home directory, you can update the `/etc/passwd` entry to point to a different directory or leave it as is, ensuring that any scripts or cron jobs do not rely on the home directory.

If you need to run cron jobs as the `elasticsearch` user, ensure that the scripts are properly configured and do not depend on the home directory.
