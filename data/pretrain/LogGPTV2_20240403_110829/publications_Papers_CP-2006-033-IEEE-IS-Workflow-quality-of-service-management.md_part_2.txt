V.CONCLUSIONS
The importance of QoS (Quality of Service)
management for organizations and for workflow systems
has already been much recognized by academia and
industry. The design and execution of workflows cannot be
undertaken while ignoring the importance of QoS
measurements since they directly impact the success of
organizations. In this paper we have shown a novel method
