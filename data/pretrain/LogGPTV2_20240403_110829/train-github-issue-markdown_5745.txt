Here's a sample code to illustrate the problem which stems from a case
sensitive string matching somewhere in the code:
    package main
    import (
        "fmt"
        "path/filepath"
    )
    func main() {
        a,_ := filepath.Glob("c:\\users\\*\\appdata")
        fmt.Println(a)  //this prints []
        b,_ := filepath.Glob("c:\\users\\*\\AppData")
        fmt.Println(b)  //this prints [c:\users\Default\Appdata ...]
    }
Because file and directory names in Windows are case insensitive therefore
this is a bug.
Please note that before the asterisk(*) the path name does not have to match
case but after the asterisk it doesn't provide any results if the case doesn't
match.
