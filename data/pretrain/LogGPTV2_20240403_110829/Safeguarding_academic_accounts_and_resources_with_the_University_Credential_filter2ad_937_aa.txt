## Abstract
The theft of online identities, whether through malware or phishing, is a significant and present threat. While many attackers seek credentials for financial gain, an analysis of compromised accounts at our institutions reveals that university credentials are often stolen to gain free and unfettered access to information. This non-traditional motivation for credential theft places a special burden on academic institutions. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of the University Credential Abuse Auditing System (UCAAS). We evaluated UCAAS at two major research universities with tens of thousands of user accounts and millions of login events over a two-week period. The system successfully identified 125 compromised accounts with zero false positives during the trial.

## I. Introduction
Data theft on the Internet is a thriving business [1]. Analysis of phishing [2] and malware [3] incidents shows that attackers primarily target financial data, with banking sites being the most common targets. However, an analysis at our academic institutions reveals that credentials stolen in university settings are typically used not for financial gain but to gain free and unrestricted access to information. Compromised accounts frequently use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and library publication resources. Attackers exploit VPNs to bypass censorship mechanisms in their countries and download large numbers of articles to resell on underground markets [4].

To address this issue, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that supplements existing security measures to rapidly identify compromised accounts. Our system, the University Credential Abuse Auditing System (UCAAS), analyzes authentication logs daily and reports accounts with suspicious activity. The detection technology is based on a machine-learning approach that automatically generates features before classifying user activity. Our work makes three key contributions: 
1. We report on the motivations of attackers who compromise academic accounts based on several years of incident analysis at two large universities.
2. We present the design of an authentication log analysis solution that can process the daily activity of thousands of accounts with high accuracy and a low false-positive rate.
3. We evaluate this system using several weeks of logs from each university in close collaboration with the institutions' security teams, providing insights into the specific challenges of analyzing malicious activity from campus data.

## II. Background
University accounts have become attractive targets for attackers seeking access to online campus resources. During 2010 and the first six months of 2011, the security team at the University of Michigan (UofM) recorded 613 incident tickets related to unauthorized use of university accounts, representing a significant fraction of the workload of security officers. Similarly, the security team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) recorded 26 compromised accounts in the first half of 2011. This burden led both universities' security teams to engage researchers to better understand the threat and determine how to mitigate it.

### A. University Account Compromises
A study of account compromises revealed various attack motivations. Traditional malicious activities included spamming via university email accounts and installing malware on public machines. Adversaries also attempted to access confidential user information or databases. Surprisingly, some compromises involved users who simply wanted free and unfettered access to information, such as scholarly publications or circumventing internet filtering in their home countries.

To understand the activity in more detail, the UofM security team collected 24 hours of NetFlow data for the VPN sessions of 8 compromised accounts. All 8 accounts were accessed from China. The illegitimate users visited websites blocked by Chinese network censorship, repeatedly accessed the library website, and logged into other university accounts, likely to evade detection.

Interestingly, such illegitimate VPN and library access was the most common type of compromised account activity (18.9% of total incidents at UofM). Stolen accounts were often resold on Chinese online marketplaces, such as Taobao, for less than ten dollars per month, complete with instructions on using the university VPN and accessing scholarly resources.

### B. University Authentication Infrastructure
Universities provide a wide range of resources and online services to diverse user groups, including webmail, VPN, course registration, online storage, payroll, and library resources. For example, UofM has 41,924 students and 34,947 faculty and staff members, with a total of 556,281 unique accounts. UIUC has 54,612 people, including 43,862 students and 10,750 faculty and staff members. Unlike UofM, UIUC locks accounts a few months after students graduate or employees leave the university.

Both UofM and UIUC share a similar authentication infrastructure built around the Kerberos protocol and different authentication portals for various services, such as single-sign-on protocols for web services and VPN services. These services represent the majority of campus usage, and account compromises are likely to manifest in their logs.

## III. Detection System

### A. Overview
1. **Goals**: The primary goal of UCAAS is to assist security teams by automatically flagging compromised accounts. The system must be effective in detecting compromised accounts, even if the illegitimate activity is stealthy. To achieve this, we carefully selected a combination of features in which illegitimate activity would be most likely to manifest. Additionally, given the relative scarcity of compromised accounts, the system must minimize false positives to avoid operational and user impact. We defined a requirement of a maximum average of two false alarms per day.
2. **Overall Design**: UCAAS detects suspicious accounts based on authentication logs collected from university systems. It filters authentication activity to keep only logs generated by users who accessed the VPN at least once. The system then extracts and analyzes a set of features for the daily activity of each account. Finally, a classifier determines whether an account is compromised or not. The model used by the classifier is trained and updated dynamically over time using past n days of authentication logs.

### B. Features
1. **Suspicious Behavior Features**:
   - **Temporal-Spatial Violation**: Captures accounts with activities from geographically different locations in a short period.
   - **Suspicious IP Addresses**: Labels an IP address as suspicious if it was used by more than one account to log in during one day.
   - **Suspicious Usage Pattern**: Flags accounts with exclusive VPN and library accesses, indicating idle accounts used only by the compromising entity.

2. **IP Address-based Features**:
   - Generates features based on geographic location, Autonomous System Number (ASN), and Top-Level Domain (TLD).

3. **Resource Usage-based Features**:
   - Learns the ratios of resource usage for the account, such as the number of VPN connections and university website accesses.

4. **Profile-based Features**:
   - Computes the probability that the latest activity matches the historical profile of user activity collected over the past week.

### C. Classification
After computing feature values, UCAAS classifies accounts into benign or suspicious categories using a logistic regression classifier implemented in Weka [6]. Initial experiments with various machine-learning algorithms, including support vector machine, naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbors, showed that logistic regression provided the best accuracy.

## IV. Evaluation
We evaluated UCAAS at two major research universities with tens of thousands of user accounts and millions of login events over a two-week period. The system successfully identified 125 compromised accounts with zero false positives during the trial. This evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of UCAAS in reducing the burden on university security teams and highlighted the specific challenges of analyzing malicious activity from campus data.

## V. Conclusion
The University Credential Abuse Auditing System (UCAAS) provides a robust solution for safeguarding academic accounts and resources. By leveraging machine learning and a comprehensive set of features, UCAAS effectively identifies compromised accounts with high accuracy and minimal false positives. This system offers valuable insights and practical tools for enhancing the security of academic environments.
