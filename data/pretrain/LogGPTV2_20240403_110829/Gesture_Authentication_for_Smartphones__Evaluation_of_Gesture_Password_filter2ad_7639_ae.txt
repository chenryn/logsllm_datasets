propose three novel policy designs for gesture passwords:
blacklist, consolidated and lexical. These are evaluated in a
new two-day study (N=4000). While the lexical policy reduces
security with respect to a online attack with 20 guesses, the
blacklist and consolidated policies boost guessing entropy
and reduce susceptibility to dictionary attacks at a modest
cost in terms of usability. We believe gesture passwords are
a promising smartphone authentication technology and that
future work should focus on understanding the gestures people
create and the policies, guidance, and feedback they need to
do so more securely. This paper works towards this goal.

APPENDIX A
SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIZATION OF GESTURES
Table X reports subjective categorization rates for gestures.
The ﬁrst seven categories appear in prior work [11], while
the remaining four categories of Compound, Cursive, Iconic
and Other were newly introduced. Compound gestures are
complex, involving at least two or more elements (e.g., a shape
and a letter); cursive gestures involve short sequences of letters
(e.g., hand-writing) and; iconic gestures depict objects (e.g.,
hands and ﬂowers). Other collects any remaining gestures.
First study and second study baseline and lexical catego-
rizations are broadly consistent. Second study blacklist and
consolidated policies show reductions in gestures categorized
as geometric shapes and letters and elevated rates for com-
pound categorizations. Compared to prior work (right column),
gesture categorizations show reduced rates for geometric
shapes and letters due to the introduction of new categories
(particularly compound) and a reduced occurrence of math
and music symbols, possibly due to different populations
(university students in [11] versus MTurk workers here).
APPENDIX B
DISTRIBUTION OF GESTURE POINTS IN POLICY
CONDITIONS IN FIRST AND SECOND STUDIES
Figure 9 depicts the distribution of gesture points in both
studies. All results show bias in start and ﬁnal point locations;
ﬁrst study data and the second study baseline policy are most
strongly biased (to left corners) in start position and the lexical
policy most evenly distributed in start and ﬁnal positions.

APPENDIX C
n-GRAM MODEL RESULTS
Table XI presents details of the 134 n-gram models generated from gestures captured in the ﬁrst study that achieved a crack
rate of greater than 10%. These data highlight the challenges in selecting appropriate n-gram models as high crack rates can
be combined with low similarity to the original user-chosen gestures. Similarly, high similarity scores can be obtained with
larger models (i.e., with more ﬁne-grained discretizations) while the number of n-gram cases observed can be reduced.
SUBSET OF 134 n-GRAM MODELS GENERATED FROM FIRST STUDY DATA THAT ACHIEVED A CRACK RATE OF GREATER THAN 10%. PROPERTIES OF
CRACK RATE (CR), SIMILARITY (SM) AND COMPLETENESS (CP) METRICS ARE REPORTED FOR EACH MODEL. THE SELECTION MODELS FOR
OPTIMIZATION ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN BOLD.
