DynamicChangeDetection class and JitChangeDetection class were previously
private, with only the functions for each made public. The doc comments are on
the functions, so nothing shows up in the API docs.
Previously we were having issues with duplication in the list of exported
public docs, it seems like this is still not quite fixed?
