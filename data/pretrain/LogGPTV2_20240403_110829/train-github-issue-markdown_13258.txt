The `DynamicChangeDetection` and `JitChangeDetection` classes were previously marked as private, with only their methods being made public. As a result, the documentation comments, which are associated with the methods, do not appear in the API documentation.

We previously encountered issues with duplication in the list of exported public documentation. It appears that this problem has not been fully resolved. 

To improve clarity and ensure that the documentation is properly displayed, we should consider making the classes public or reorganizing the documentation to include class-level comments. Additionally, we should review and address any remaining duplication in the exported public documentation.
