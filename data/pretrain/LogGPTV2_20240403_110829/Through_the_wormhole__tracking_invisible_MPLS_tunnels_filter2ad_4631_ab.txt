### Signature and Router Identification

The signature (with \( n = 2 \)) is determined by the initial Time-to-Live (TTL) values of two different messages: an ICMP time-exceeded message elicited by a traceroute probe, and an ICMP echo-reply message obtained from an echo-request probe. Table 1 summarizes the main router signatures, along with associated router brands and operating systems. This feature is particularly interesting because the two most widely deployed router brands, Cisco and Juniper, theoretically exhibit distinct MPLS behaviors. In our survey, while a significant proportion (i.e., 25%) of operators use a mix of router technologies, Cisco routers are the most prevalent (58%), followed by Juniper (28%).

### Discovering Invisible MPLS Tunnels

This section describes our techniques for revealing the content or at least identifying the presence of invisible MPLS tunnels. We propose four complementary mechanisms based on traceroute or ping, which fall into two categories. First, Forward/Return Path Length Analysis (FRPLA) and Return Tunnel Length Analysis (RTLA) provide high-level information about invisible MPLS tunnels: FRPLA offers an estimation, while RTLA provides the exact number of hops hidden by the return MPLS tunnel between the Ingress and Egress Label Edge Routers (LERs) in the return LSP. Second, Direct Path Revelation (DPR) and Backward Recursive Path Revelation (BRPR) explicitly reveal the content of the obfuscated tunnel, either in a single probe or hop by hop through a recursive probing process.

Combining these four techniques allows us to cover a majority of MPLS use cases, including standard behaviors of Juniper and Cisco routers and typical network MPLS/IGP/BGP configurations. Table 2 summarizes the scope of the four measurement techniques for different MPLS configurations. The following sections delve deeper into our measurement techniques: Section 3.1 focuses on FRPLA and RTLA, Section 3.2 on DPR and BRPR, and Section 3.3 validates them using several studies, including experiments with GNS3 (an emulator running the actual IOS of real routers in a virtualized environment) and a dedicated cross-validation campaign on explicit tunnels. Finally, Section 3.4 discusses the inherent limitations of our techniques.

#### 3.1 Inferring the Length of Tunnels

The first two techniques, FRPLA and RTLA, are based on the same principle. When entering an invisible tunnel in the forward path, the IP-TTL is not copied into the MPLS Label Stack Entry (LSE) if the Ingress LER does not enable the `ttl-propagate` option, making the tunnel appear as a single hop. For example, in Figure 2, P1, P2, and P3 in AS2 are not revealed by the traceroute run from the Vantage Point to the target CE2 in AS3. Instead, the link PE1 → PE2 appears as a single hop, as illustrated in the first Paris traceroute output in Figure 4c.

When performing the traceroute from the Vantage Point to the target, if the TTL expires at the Egress LER, it generates an ICMP time-exceeded message. If this reply also goes back through an MPLS tunnel, the LSE-TTL is copied into the IP-TTL only if it is lower than the IP-TTL to avoid routing loops (this behavior is implemented by Cisco [17]). Formally, if we denote \( \text{TTLI}_\text{IP}(X) \) (resp., \( \text{TTLI}_\text{LSE}(X) \)) as the IP-TTL (resp., LSE-TTL) of the reply in transit at node X on the return path, and \( h(X, Y) \) as the number of hops from nodes X to Y, we have:

\[
\text{TTLI}_\text{IP}(\text{VP}) = \min(\text{TTLI}_\text{IP}(E), \text{TTLI}_\text{LSE}(E)) - h(E, \text{VP})
\]

where VP is the vantage point that receives replies coming back via E, the Egress LER of the return path. Thus, when there is a tunnel on the return path, \( \text{TTLI}_\text{IP}(\text{VP}) = \text{TTLI}_\text{LSE}(E) - h(E, \text{VP}) \).

For instance, in Figure 2, if the forward tunnel from the Vantage Point to CE2 is the same as the return tunnel when the IP packet expires at PE2, PE2 sets both the IP and LSE-TTL to 255. Only the LSE-TTL is decremented in the tunnel. At the Egress LER of the return path (PE1), the minimum scheme is applied, resulting in the value 252 being copied into the IP-TTL (i.e., \( \min(255, 252) \)). Thus, the IP-TTL observed by the Vantage Point when receiving the ICMP time-exceeded message would be \( 252 - 2 = 250 \).

In practice, this minimum scheme allows Egress routers to behave consistently whether the `ttl-propagate` option is used or not at the Ingress LER, avoiding routing loops in a stateless manner without any signaling. With this standard behavior, the number of hops of the tunnel is included in the return path length. However, the return tunnel length is still not clearly retrievable due to potential path asymmetry.

With FRPLA, we compare, at the AS granularity, the length distribution of forward and return paths. A significant differential (the so-called "shift" in Table 2) indicates the use of the no-ttl-propagate option, providing the average tunnel length of the AS.

As an example, in Figure 2, the Egress LER, PE2, is six hops from the Vantage Point, but only the two LERs (PE1 and PE2) are exposed when the LSP is invisible. On the Paris traceroute output, when the tunnel is visible (Figure 4a), each internal hop of the forward LSP is observable.

#### 3.2 Revealing the Hidden Hops

The basic idea of these methods is that not all packets are forwarded through LSPs within an MPLS network. For example, LSPs may be constructed towards only a subset of internal prefixes (e.g., loopback addresses for Juniper routers, while Cisco routers create LSPs for all internal prefixes). If one can traceroute one of the router's internal IGP IP addresses, e.g., the incoming interface of the Egress LER (revealed with PHP), one can see explicit IGP routes without labels, inferring the hidden LDP tunnel.

Additionally, Cisco routers can be configured to limit LDP signaling for external BGP transit traffic, ensuring that all external BGP transit traffic goes through MPLS tunnels while internal traffic is routed via IGP explicit routes. In both cases (Juniper default or basic Cisco configuration), and when using the BGP next-hop feature on LERs, all external BGP transit traffic goes through MPLS tunnels, while internal traffic is routed via IGP explicit routes.

For example, in Figure 4c, using the command `mpls ldp label allocate global host-routes` on Cisco routers mimics Juniper behavior, revealing the explicit IGP route in a single probing shot if targeting the incoming interface of the Egress PE2. This is the principle of the Direct Path Revelation (DPR).

Our last method, Backward Recursive Path Revelation (BRPR), is based on the PHP feature when the network enables LDP everywhere (the standard and default behavior of Cisco LSRs). Since traceroute naturally reveals the incoming IP interface of each Egress LER, we can apply a recursive traceroute approach that targets this last internal prefix to reveal each intermediate hop in a backward fashion from the Egress LER until the Ingress LER. This approach works well when BGP routes remain similar for all internal prefixes of the targeted AS, i.e., they enter via the same Ingress LER and follow the same shortest IGP path inside (this is the default LDP behavior).

#### 3.3 Validating Our Measurement Techniques

To validate our measurement mechanisms, we conducted experiments using GNS3, which allows us to run the actual Cisco IOS system (in this case, IOS 15.2(4)) over an emulated platform. We also analyzed a similar Juniper testbed, except for the UHP case, which is not available for LDP on Junos. For our experiments, we set up a simple configuration (see Figure 2) with three ASes: AS1 is the client AS with router CE1 (the traceroute source is connected to CE1), a transit AS (AS2) running MPLS and LDP for the LSP setup between five routers (PE1, P1, P2, P3, and PE2), and another client AS, AS3, with router CE2 connected to PE2. The initial traceroute target is an internal prefix of AS3 (i.e., a loopback of CE2). Routing between ASes is handled with BGP, while internal routing is managed through OSPF.

We tested several MPLS feature combinations on the network given in Figure 2. All configurations are simple to enable (a few basic commands per LSR) and close to the Cisco MPLS default configuration. The first scenario, the Default configuration, has PHP (with implicit null label – label value of 3) and TTL propagation enabled by default, and all internal IP prefixes are announced through LDP. Traceroute explicitly shows LSPs with MPLS labels, as shown in the simulation output in Figure 4a.

The second scenario, the Backward Recursive configuration, is the same as Default except that TTL propagation is disabled (command `no mpls ip propagate-ttl` applied on all LERs). Traceroute does not show MPLS tunnels anymore, as illustrated in Figure 4b. However, retracing the previous trace recursively backward starting initially from the Egress LER PE2 until the Ingress LER PE1 allows us to reveal the entire tunnel, but without any MPLS flags, one LSR at a time. This corresponds to the expected output with the Backward Recursive Path Revelation technique (BRPR).

The third scenario, the Explicit Route configuration, is similar to Backward Recursive, but only loopback addresses (i.e., "host addresses" instead of all prefixes) are announced into LDP (command `mpls ldp label allocate global host-routes` applied on all LERs). This is also the default Juniper configuration. A trace towards CE2 reveals PE2's incoming address (which is not a loopback address, hence not announced through LDP), and then a trace towards this address reveals the full LSP PE1 → P1 → P2 → P3 → PE2 (Figure 4c) but without MPLS flags since it is not switched through MPLS space. This corresponds to the output expected with the Direct Path Revelation (DPR).

Finally, the last scenario is the Totally Invisible configuration. In this case, UHP is enabled on all LERs (the command `mpls ldp...`).

### Cross-Validation Results

Table 3 presents the cross-validation results on 5,364 Ingress-Egress LER pairs, scattered across 271 different ASes. The results show that DPR was successful in 57% of cases, BRPR in 3%, and a hybrid DPR/BRPR in 5%. In 26% of cases, either BRPR or DPR failed, and in 8% of cases, neither technique was applicable.

### Conclusion

By combining FRPLA, RTLA, DPR, and BRPR, we can effectively discover and analyze invisible MPLS tunnels in various network configurations. These techniques provide valuable insights into the structure and behavior of MPLS networks, enabling better network management and security.
