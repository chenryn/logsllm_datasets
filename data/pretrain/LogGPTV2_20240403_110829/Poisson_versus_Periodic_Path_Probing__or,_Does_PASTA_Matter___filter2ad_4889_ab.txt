### Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is a statistical method used to compare two empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). However, it assumes that the underlying distributions are continuous. The KS test is highly sensitive to this assumption because it focuses on the maximum vertical distance between the two CDFs. It is important to note that in Internet path Round-Trip Time (RTT) distributions, the data can be nearly discontinuous. This occurs when multiple probing packets measure the same RTT value, which is often determined by constant propagation and transmission delays. Such discontinuities typically appear at or near the minimum measurement values, especially in lightly loaded paths with small queuing delays, as these delays only increase RTT measurements.

### Example: RTT Empirical CDFs

For instance, Figure 2 illustrates the empirical CDFs of RTTs measured in a session from MIT to U-Oregon (I=20ms, L=480 bytes). In practical terms, the KS test reports a P-value of 0.08, indicating that the null hypothesis (that the two distributions are identical) cannot be rejected. In contrast, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) test, which measures the divergence between two probability distributions, reports a P-value of 0.88, further supporting the null hypothesis.

### KL Test Results

Figure 4 shows the distribution of P-values reported by the KL test for various inter-arrival times (I). We observe that we can reject the null hypothesis (H0) for only 5-10% of the sessions at a significance level of 10%. For more than 90% of the sessions, the P-values are significantly higher, indicating that we cannot reject H0. Therefore, for the majority of the measurement sessions, we can assume that the RTT distributions observed by Poisson and Periodic probing are identical.

It is worth noting that larger average probing periods (e.g., 500ms and 1000ms) result in lower P-values, suggesting wider, though not statistically significant, differences between the two RTT distributions. This is because, at these longer intervals, the underlying process exhibits more variability over the measurement period, leading to different observations by the two probing processes.

### Loss Rate Measurements

For loss rate estimates, we used the same set of sessions as in the RTT measurements, but only considered the 600 probing packets sent from the source to the destination (ignoring reverse direction packets). Let \( l_e \) and \( l_p \) be the loss rates for the Poisson and Periodic streams, respectively. The difference between the two loss rates is \( \Delta l = l_e - l_p \). Figure 5 shows the empirical CDF of \( \Delta l \) for sessions where some loss was observed, either in Poisson or Periodic probes, but neither loss rate exceeds 10%.

In about 80% of the sessions, the two loss rates are within 1%, and the maximum loss rate difference is less than 3%. While a hypothesis test for the equality of two proportions could theoretically be used, such tests assume independent loss events, which is not true for Internet losses. Instead, we categorize the sessions based on the loss rate estimated by the Poisson probes into six classes: lossless (\( l_e = 0 \)), low loss (\( l_e \in (0, 1\%] \)), medium loss (\( l_e \in [0.9\%, 5\%] \)), high loss (\( l_e \in [4.5\%, 10\%] \)), very high loss (\( l_e \in [9\%, 20\%] \)), and broken (\( l_e \in [18\%, 100\%] \)). These categories have a small overlap to avoid boundary effects.

Figure 6 shows the fraction of sessions in each category. About 78% of the sessions are classified as lossless or low loss. For each category, we also show the fraction of sessions where the loss rate estimates agree, and the fractions where Periodic probing leads to a lower or higher category. The two probing techniques agree in more than 70% of the sessions.

### Packet Pair Dispersion Measurements

In dispersion measurements, we send back-to-back packet pairs of size \( L \) from the source to the destination. The destination measures the time spacing ("dispersion") \( \Delta \) between the arrival of the first and second packets. The dispersion is related to the cross-traffic load and available bandwidth in the network path. Higher cross-traffic loads at the path's bottleneck result in wider dispersions due to interference.

If one of the two packets is lost, the corresponding pair is ignored. The average probing inter-arrival \( I \) controls the time spacing between successive packet pairs, not between packets of the same pair, which are always sent back-to-back.

Let \( \Delta_e \) and \( \Delta_p \) be the median dispersions estimated from the Poisson and Periodic probing streams, respectively, for a particular session. The relative difference between the two dispersion medians is defined as \( \Delta \Delta = 2 \frac{\Delta_e - \Delta_p}{\Delta_e + \Delta_p} \). Figure 7 shows the empirical CDF of \( \Delta \Delta \). About 90% of the sessions have \( |\Delta \Delta| < 2.5\% \), and the relative difference does not exceed 8%.

### Goodness-of-Fit Test

We also examined whether the two probing processes observe the same dispersion distribution using the KL test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the two dispersion samples (Poisson and Periodic) for a given session follow an identical distribution. Figure 8 shows the distribution of P-values reported by the KL test for various inter-arrival times \( I \). The P-value is less than 10% for only 5-10% of the sessions, implying that we can assume H0 to be true for the majority of the sessions.

### Discussion

The experimental results indicate that there may not be a significant difference between Poisson and Periodic probing in the context of real Internet measurements. This does not mean that we recommend Periodic probing over Poisson probing, but rather that studies using Periodic probing should not be dismissed. A few additional remarks on the accuracy of Poisson and Periodic probing follow:

1. **Loss Rate Estimation**: The fraction of dropped Poisson probing packets at a network queue does not estimate the packet loss rate; instead, it estimates the fraction of time that the queue is full. For bursty traffic, the packet loss rate can be higher than the full-queue probability.

2. **Periodic Probing Limitations**: Periodic probing at a certain inter-arrival \( I \) cannot detect effects occurring at lower time scales. If loss bursts are much shorter than \( I \), Periodic probing may underestimate both the full-queue probability and the loss rate. Poisson probing, with a sufficiently large number of samples, should be able to estimate the full-queue probability.

3. **Non-Poisson Arrival at Bottleneck**: Even if Poisson probing is generated at the source, the probing packets may not arrive at the bottleneck link as a Poisson process. For example, if the packets go through a store-and-forward link with capacity \( C \), their inter-arrivals after that link cannot be lower than \( L/C \). This issue is important for Internet measurements, as most network paths involve multiple queues.

### Appendix: Density Estimation

Given two samples \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) taking values in a range \( R_S \), we approximate their probability density functions with probability mass functions \( q_1(i) \) and \( q_2(i) \) defined over a set of bins \( Q \). The initial bin size \( w \) is selected based on the Freedman-Diaconis rule as \( w = 2 n^{-1/3} I_Q \), where \( n \) is the number of samples in the joint sample \( S_1 \cup S_2 \) and \( I_Q \) is the interquartile range of \( R_S \).

To ensure each bin contains at least a certain number of measurements from both samples, we use an adaptive histogram approach. If a bin does not include at least 1% of the measurements from each sample, we merge it with the adjacent bin. This process is repeated until the constraint is met.
