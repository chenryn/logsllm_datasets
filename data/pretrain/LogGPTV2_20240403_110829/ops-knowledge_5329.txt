User: I've been browsing documentation, but haven't been able to find a straightforward tutorial, so I apologize if this is a really simple question.
Anyway, I have eclipse with pydev installed on MAC OSX, and I want configure wxPython to work with eclipse, how do I do this? Once I've downloaded wxpython, what steps do I take to allow wxPython development from eclipse?
Thanks!
Assistant: wxPython install by default to the following path /usr/local/lib/wxPython-2.9.4.0
When adding a path to the Interpreter libraries section in the eclipse preferences add this path: 
/usr/local/lib/wxPython-2.9.4.0/lib/python2.7/site-packages/wx-2.9.4-osx_cocoa
