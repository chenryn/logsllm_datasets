Ensure reproducibility when loading pretrained models.
## Motivation
In order to distribute results in a transparent manner, it is important to
ensure reproducibility.
When loading a pretrained model, I cannot get the same weights, probably due
to non-initialized weights.  
Even when using `set_seed`, I cannot get twice the same models.
## Your contribution
I created a small example to illustrate the issue.
