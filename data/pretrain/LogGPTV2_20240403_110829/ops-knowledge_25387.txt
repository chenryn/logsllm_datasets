I am seeking some domain expertise with `pymongo` that I currently lack. Specifically, I need to know if the "right" parts of the `pymongo` driver are written in Python, such that I can call `gevent.monkey_patch()` and successfully alter `pymongo`'s blocking behavior for read/write operations within `gevent`'s "asynchronous" greenlets.

If this requires additional work with `gevent` and `pymongo`, but is feasible, I am more than willing to invest the time. I would appreciate some guidance over IRC.

**Note:** At a small scale, MongoDB writes are not a significant issue because we simply queue the write request before unblocking. However, discussions with Fiorix about his Twisted-based asynchronous MongoDB driver (https://github.com/fiorix/mongo-async-python-driver) have revealed that even quick write requests can cause problems in asynchronous applications at scale. Additionally, non-blocking reads could also pose issues from the start.

**Initial Inspection:**
From my initial inspection, it does not appear that the `pymongo` driver performs any socket operations in C code. Therefore, it should be compatible with `gevent`, as blocking operations should only block the green thread.
