User: I need exchange data between python daemon (cluster nods send data to this daemon) and php script (apache) which, is accessed by webbrowsers. What do you recommend as technology which could establish some connection between them. Both, python daemon and apache/php is on the same machine. 
Thank you.
Assistant: If you want things to be synchronous use a named socket(Amazing feature on Unix systems.)
If you want things to be asynchronous use pickle(there is a php version of it too.)
