User: We're  using Celery for background tasks in our Django project.
Unfortunately, we have many blocking sockets in tasks, that can be established for a long time. So Celery becomes fully loaded and does not respond.
Gevent can help me with sockets, but Celery has only experimental support of gevent (and as I found in practice, it doesn't work well).
So I considered to switch to another task queue system.
I can choose between two different ways:

Write my own task system. This is a least preferred choice, because it requires much time.
Find good and well-tried replacement for Celery that will work after monkey patching.

Is there any analogue of Celery, that will guarantee me execution of my tasks even after sudden exit?
Assistant: Have you tried to use Celery + eventlet? It works well in our project
