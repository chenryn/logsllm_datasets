User: I am creating an python based msi installer. 
by which I am executing some python scripts while the installer is running.
But I dont want to deliver/install these scripts with package just want to hide them in the msi and use while its running.  I tried using binary table in the msi for the same but it didn't work.  >How should i do it?
Assistant: A solution would be temporary files. You can store them in Binary table and use two custom actions:

one which extracts them before the installation starts
another one which removes them when installation is finished

You can extract them in a temporary location, for example the user Temp folder.
