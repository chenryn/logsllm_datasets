User: I'm trying to create a python shell script to create a number of directories in Ubuntu Linux. The main directory I'm trying to create directories in is protected from write access. Is there a way to allow the Python script to be allowed to create directories in there as if it's the root user but not have to run the script through su, since other users might need to run the script but should not have su access?
Assistant: This question is not really related to Python. The Python script is just a process like any other process and needs to have to right permissions to do things. The usual method is to create a group, and make the parent directory g+ws for that group. Then add the appropriate users to that group as a supplemental group.
