ABSTRACT
This paper studies the routing dynamics of malicious networks. We
characterize the routing behavior of malicious networks on both
short and long timescales. We ﬁnd that malicious networks more
consistently advertise preﬁxes with short durations and long inter-
arrival times; over longer timescales, we ﬁnd that malicious ASes
connect with more upstream providers than legitimate ASes, and
they also change upstream providers more frequently.

INTRODUCTION
Attackers use advanced techniques to launch spam campaigns or
mount attacks; in particular, Ramchandran et al. [?] observed that
some some attackers send spam from hijacked preﬁxes. Previous
studies have studied different malicious activities in isolation such
as worms, botnets, spam, and Internet scam infrastructure [?, ?]
and proposed detection solutions for each of them. Unfortunately,
observing just the nature of the attack itself is not sufﬁcient, be-
cause any given network or host may mount different attacks on
different days. Rather than attempting to detect any individual at-
tack, we characterize the routing behavior of malicious networks
that are primarily responsible for cybercriminal activities and iden-
tify features of this behavior that may be more stable across time.
Although our initial goal is simply to characterize this behavior,
our belief is that ultimately certain aspects of routing behavior may
serve as invariants for detecting malicious infrastructure, even as
the attacks themselves evolve. Speciﬁcally, we believe that rout-
ing behavior may ultimately be useful for identifying and monitor-
ing the activity of networks that mount attacks, even as the attacks
themselves change.
We perform the ﬁrst systematic study of the wide area routing
behavior of malicious networks. To understand the nature of mali-
cious routing behavior with respect to legitimate domains, we com-
pare the routing behavior from autonomous systems (ASes) listed
in Hostexploit to the routing behavior of the ASes that host the top
500 Alexa domains. Hostexploit [?], an organization that correlates
data from multiple sources such as spam, malware, spam bots, bot-
net C&C servers, and phishing servers from industry partners, has
been publicizing lists of ASes that show the highest levels of cy-

bercriminal activity for the last three years. Hostexploit rates each
AS with an index based on the activity of the AS weighted by the
size of its allocated address space. There are examples of these
networks that were detected and eventually disconnected including
ATRIVO/Intercage on September 2008 and VolgaHost on January
2011.
We perform our analysis across two timescales. On short
timescales, we study how malicious networks advertise their pre-
ﬁxes. For every preﬁx, we group the announcements into distinct
events and study the duration and interarrival time of each event
over the period of one month. We perform our analysis for two
months, January and June, for four consecutive years (2008–2011).
We show only the results for January 2011, but our results are quali-
tatively consistent for all time periods. We ﬁnd that malicious ASes
advertise a large portion of their preﬁxes (45%) over events that
have both shorter duration and longer interarrival time than legit-
imate ASes. Over long timescales, we study the wiring trends of
malicious ASes and ﬁnd that malicious ASes connect with more
providers than legitimate ASes; they also change their upstream
providers more frequently.
2. DATA
We use the list of networks that are reported as top in Inter-
net criminal activities according to Hostexploit from 2009–2011 to
identify a set of malicious ASes. We augment this dataset with the
following sources: (1) To study the behavior of malicious networks
on short timescales, we collect the complete set of BGP updates
from malicious networks, from all RouteViews monitors. We clus-
ter the BGP updates we observe for each preﬁx into preﬁx events. A
preﬁx event begins when a RouteViews monitor receives a new an-
nouncement for a preﬁx from some origin AS. A preﬁx event ends
at the time when the same monitor receives the ﬁrst withdrawal for
the corresponding preﬁx. (2) To understand the behavior of ma-
licious networks over long timescales, we obtain a publicly avail-
able dataset of customer-provider links formed among ASes over
a ten-year period [?]. To understand how malicious behavior of
malicious ASes differs from legitimate ASes, we perform the same
analysis for the ASes that host the top 500 Alexa domains.
3. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
Malicious networks advertise their preﬁxes over events with
shorter duration and longer interarrival time than legitimate
networks. To study the behavior of malicious networks over short
timescales, we proceed as follows: (1) We cluster all the announce-
ments for all the preﬁxes that originate from malicious networks, as
observed from all RouteViews monitors for one month into events
as described in Section ??. (2) We jointly examine the duration and
432short duration - short interarrival time and d) short duration - long
interarrival time. We consider the duration of a preﬁx event to be
short if is less than ﬁve minutes, which is the median advertisement
duration of about 40% of the preﬁxes. Similarly, we consider the
interarrival time of a preﬁx event to be short if it is less than 100
seconds, which is the median interarrival value for about 40% of
the preﬁxes for all of their events. (3) For every preﬁx, we compute
the fraction of the events we observe for each event type. Figure ??
shows the distribution of events per preﬁx for each event type. The
most striking ﬁnding is that about 80% of the preﬁxes advertised by
malicious ASes are advertised mostly with events of short duration
and long interarrival time for about 70% of preﬁx events, whereas
roughly 85% of the legitimate preﬁxes have no events of this type
at all.
Malicious networks link with more providers through their life-
time than legitimate networks. We examine the total number of
providers that ASes connect to over their lifetime. Here, we fo-
cus on the ASes that are Enterprise Customers (EC) according to
their AS classiﬁcation [?]. Figure ?? shows the cumulative number
of average providers that malicious and legitimate ASes connect
to over time. We note that both the number of ASes and the cu-
mulative number of providers increase as time progresses, but the
rate at which the two increase is not always the same. For some
snapshots we observe a small decrease in the average cumulative
number of providers. We observe that malicious ASes link on av-
erage with a total of twelve providers over the course of twelve
years, whereas the legitimate ASes connect to an average of four
providers. AS23456 linked with a total of 183 providers from April
2007 through January 2010.
Malicious networks change their upstream connectivity more
frequently than legitimate networks. To quantify the aggressive-
ness of an AS in changing its upstream connectivity, we consider
the distance between the set of the AS’s providers for two consecu-
tive snapshots. We use the Jaccard distance as a metric of distance
between the set of providers between two consecutive snapshots.
For example, a Jaccard distance of 0.8 indicates that 80% of the
links seen in the two snapshots are observed in one of the two snap-
shots but not in both. We calculated the Jaccard distance between
two consecutive snapshots for each AS throughout its lifetime. Fig-
ure ?? shows the distribution of the Jaccard distance values. We ob-
serve that malicious ASes more frequently change their upstream
connectivity than legitimate ASes.
