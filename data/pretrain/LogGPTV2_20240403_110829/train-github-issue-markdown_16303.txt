##### Detailed description
I found problem in  
parentLocation = self.locations[parentTask.locationID]
In python script:  
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/ts/misc/trace_profiler.py
first I found problem in read file string  
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.4.1/modules/ts/misc/trace_profiler.py#L164  
This I fix by put whole name in variable:  
filename = 'OpenCVTrace-000.txt'; before was '/OpenCVTrace-000.txt'  
But after that I still get error  
Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "trace_profiler.py", line 442, in  
trace.process()  
File "trace_profiler.py", line 287, in process  
parentLocation = self.locations[parentTask.locationID]  
KeyError: 1
It show that dict is empty.  
Test report file can by find in attachment.
