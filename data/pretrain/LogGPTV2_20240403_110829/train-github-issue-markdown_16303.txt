Subject: Issue with `trace_profiler.py` in OpenCV 3.4.1

Hello,

I have encountered an issue in the `trace_profiler.py` script, specifically with the following line:
```python
parentLocation = self.locations[parentTask.locationID]
```

The script is located here:
- [trace_profiler.py](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/ts/misc/trace_profiler.py)

### Steps Taken Before Reporting
- I have read the documentation to ensure I am testing with the latest developer build.
- I have checked for existing issues to avoid duplicates and did not find any similar reports.

### System Information
- **OpenCV Version:** 3.4.1
- **Operating System:** Linux 64-bit
- **Compiler:** GCC

### Detailed Description
While running the `trace_profiler.py` script, I encountered a problem at the following line:
```python
parentLocation = self.locations[parentTask.locationID]
```
The error trace is as follows:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "trace_profiler.py", line 442, in <module>
    trace.process()
  File "trace_profiler.py", line 287, in process
    parentLocation = self.locations[parentTask.locationID]
KeyError: 1
```
This indicates that the dictionary `self.locations` is empty.

### Additional Details
Initially, I found an issue with the file path string at this line:
- [Line 164 in `trace_profiler.py`](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.4.1/modules/ts/misc/trace_profiler.py#L164)
I fixed it by using the full filename:
```python
filename = 'OpenCVTrace-000.txt'
```
However, even after this fix, the `KeyError` still occurs.

### Command Used
```bash
python trace_profiler.py /home/root/opencv_dnn_bench/trace/OpenCVTrace.txt
```

### Attached Files
- `OpenCVTrace.txt`
- `OpenCVTrace-000.txt`

Please let me know if you need any further information or additional details.
