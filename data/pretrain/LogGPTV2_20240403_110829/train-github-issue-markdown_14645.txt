## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
    import celery
    app = celery.Celery(
        broker='amqp://localhost',
        backend='redis://localhost',
    )
    @app.task
    def task_a(number):
        print(f'Task A: {number}')
        return number
    @app.task
    def task_b(number):
        print(f'Task B: {number}')
        return number
    @app.task
    def task_c(number):
        print(f'Task C: {number}')
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        celery.chord(
          (celery.chain(task_a.s(i), task_b.s()))
          for i in range(3)
        )(task_c.s())  # yapf: disable
        app.start()
# Expected Behavior
Expected output:
    [2021-04-11 16:44:51,364: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-15] Task A: 0
    [2021-04-11 16:44:51,364: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-16] Task A: 1
    [2021-04-11 16:44:51,364: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Task A: 2
    [2021-04-11 16:44:51,387: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-4] Task B: 2
    [2021-04-11 16:44:51,387: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] Task B: 0

    [2021-04-11 16:44:51,413: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-15] Task C: [0, 1, 2]
On `celery==5.0.5` it works fine
