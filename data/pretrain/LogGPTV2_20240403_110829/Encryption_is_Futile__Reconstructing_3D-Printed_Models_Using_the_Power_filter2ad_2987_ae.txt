tial data leak. We have supported that no technical, cyber-security
means exists to mitigate this risk, and therefore it should be ad-
dressed with other security measures. Within the framework this
could include ID.AM-4, for cataloging external information systems
(which must include the manufacturer’s equipment). It could also
include ID.AM-5, for prioritizing resources based on criticality (the
existence of a practical attack increases criticality), and ID.AM-6
requires establishing cyber-security roles for the workforce and
for third-party stakeholders (such as outsourced manufacturers).
Further subcategories can also be applied to particular organiza-
tions and manufacturing arrangements. For example, subcategories
of Supply Chain Risk Management specify routine assessment of
suppliers for compliance with contractual obligations.
The Framework can provide a roadmap for addressing newly
emerged threats such as this side-channel attack within the con-
straints of business objectives and organizational risk tolerance. The
selected examples we provide are not comprehensive, and future
work will be required to address this threat within this framework.
Encryption may be futile in some scenarios, but business operations
should not be. Security must reach beyond encryption when it isn’t
sufficient to the task.
7.3 Implications for Standards
The attack presented in this paper has shown that AM is susceptible
to vulnerabilities beyond those addressed in well-known cyber-
security and even cyber-physical security standards, such as those
referenced by NIST in [38]. The processes for creating AM-specific
digital representations, the subsequent transformations they un-
dergo, and their eventual realization as a physical object create
vulnerabilities not present in other manufacturing systems [20].

affect the main body of the print, it would likely cause print failure in the fine detail of the raised hand.
These vulnerabilities are not restricted to a single location, and may
exist across a supply chain. A standards-based approach to identi-
fying and addressing the vulnerabilities would help organizations
better secure their AM processes.
A publicly available standard for AM should provide a schematic
reference for the design to product transformation, with detailed
information models of each step of the process and associated
security threats. These information models must break down the
larger activity of “AM part production" into sub-activities, similar
to [16]. A standards-based approach to modeling the information
flow of AM processes will bring together the industry’s knowledge
of when and where security threats can exist and how they can be
exploited. This could lead to documentation of threat models, attack
surfaces, and vulnerabilities in AM, providing similar benefits to
the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) List, a widely
used list of cyber-security vulnerabilities and their identifiers [13].
In the scenario described in this paper, the sub-activity of a part
build is exploited to compromise an AM part while bypassing cyber-
security measures. A baseline reference of the part build sub-activity
would include the exposure of design data via this side-channel.
Standards can inform organizations in this way by enumerating the
attack surfaces associated with AM activities, thereby helping to
identify vulnerabilities and supporting risk analyses. Such standards
would enable organizations to develop informed policies to better-
secure their own systems.
8 CONCLUSION
To support distributed manufacturing with AM, multiple cyber-
security models have emerged that protect digital representations of
the design and other technical data. Under a Man-at-the-End threat
model, which applies in the case of a malicious service provider or
insider, the adversary’s possession of the target hardware makes
side-channel attacks possible. In this paper, we have demonstrated
the effectiveness of a side-channel approach to technical data theft.
The instrumentation system and approach developed in this
paper were able to reconstruct complete printed parts entirely
from the electrical side-channel, without any information about
the digital design files. Many of our tested models were reproduced
with no noticeable aberrations, resulting in functionally identical
counterfeit versions. Others demonstrated the limitations of a fully
automated reconstruction, but still contained enough information
that a dedicated manual process could recover the object in full.
All observed errors were in the form of fixed-size shifts in the 1-10
step range corresponding to 0.16-1.6mm; these can be identified
and repaired manually. These results constitute a significant step
forward in the art of AM reconstruction.
Current defensive technologies would not be able to detect or
prevent this attack. Cyber-security measures would be circum-
vented. The mutual-information reduction of Al-Faruque [5] or
Chhetri [12] will be difficult to apply when the sampled channel is
in direct control of the actuator. Future countermeasures research
might investigate impedance monitoring to detect probing, creating
signal artifacts that impede reconstruction, or identifying recon-
structed products. Interesting work has been done in the industrial
controls space on control signal watermarks to detect spoofed sen-
sor readings [28, 34], which might be adapted to use here. It must
be noted, however, that improvements to the approach could make
such solutions unworkable. The most effective countermeasures
available today appear to be the non-technical, procedural controls
discussed in Section 7.2.
In a direct followup, we intend to test the applicability of this
approach across multiple FDM printers, of the same and differing
models. If the attack is portable between different models of printer
and tolerant of drift in equipment behavior over time, it significantly
changes the economics of the attack. This would enable a business
model in which an adversary develops this technique and sells to
less-skilled malicious insiders or manufacturers, much as is common
in cyber-attacks today.
While this paper demonstrates the attack for an FDM 3D printer,
the same approach should be viable for other AM processes and
actuators. We believe that further refinement can push the accuracy
of this approach to 100 %, producing reconstructions functionally
identical to the original part. Consequently, this attack has direct
and serious implications to the AM outsourcing model. No purely
digital system of ensuring intellectual property protection is suffi-
cient against a Man-at-the-End attack. Our work demonstrates that
when side-channels are exploited, encryption is futile.
