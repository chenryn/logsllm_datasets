Abstract — During the last 20 years, complexity has been an
interesting topic that has been investigated in many fields of science, such
as biology, neurology, software engineering, chemistry, psychology, and
economy. A survey of the various approaches to understand complexity
has lead sometimes to a measurable quantity with a rigorous but narrow
definition and other times as merely an ad hoc label. In this paper we
investigate the complexity concept to avoid a vague use of the term
‘complexity’ in workflow designs. We present several complexity metrics
that have been used for a number of years in adjacent fields of science and
explain how they can be adapted and use to evaluate the complexity of
workflows.
1 Introduction
The term complexity is commonly found in use throughout many fields of science
including biology (Weng, Bhalla et al. 1999), neurology (Koch and Laurent 1999),
computer science (Zuse 1991), chemistry (Whitesides and Ismagilov 1999) and economy
(Arthur 1999). In the discipline of business process engineering, the terms “complex” or
“complexity” are getting some attention (Lakshmanan, Jayaprakash et al. 1991; Cardoso
2005; Cardoso 2005; Cardoso 2005; Cardoso 2005; Rolón, Ruíz et al. 2005; Cardoso 2006;
Gruhn and Laue 2006; Gruhn and Laue 2006) and we expect that it will become soon a
major research topic.
To study complex workflow and their complexity, one has first answer to the question
“What is a complex system?” Several definitions and explanations as to the formal
definition of complexity exist, but they all have some aspects in common. According to Lee
(Lee 2003), in a naïve sense, complexity is the difficulty in dealing with the system under
consideration. Complex systems involve a number of elements, arranged in structure(s),
whose dynamics are dominated by nonlinear interactions between their parts. The vast
majority of interesting properties of complex systems have to do with nonlinearity and
interdependence. Complex systems go through changes and evolution that are not
describable by a single rule and include the study of the interactions of the many parts of

the system. Since the interactions of parts are most of time nonlinear, some studies have
concentrated their attention in the approximation of complex nonlinear systems by simpler
linear ones.
Several researchers have center their efforts on characterizing and quantifying the
difficulty associated with complexity (Lee 2003). Indeed, in some cases complexity is
defined as the degree of disorder, while in other cases, it is the minimum length of the
description of a system or the amount of resource (i.e., time or memory) needed to a system
to solve a certain problem. The term complexity is typically used in to characterize real-
world entities or systems. For example, we commonly state that “a car is a complex
system”, but that “a bicycle is less complex than a car”. Also, usually, “a large system has
large complexity” but “a system with modular design has low complexity.”
In the context of Business Process management (BPM) and Workflow Management
Systems (WFM), applications and tools have moved from stand-alone office automation
systems which augmented individuals, to networked and shared applications. The
architectures based on workflow to support this new way of distributed working gave place
to a rising complexity. Complexity hampers the correct development of workflows. Some
complexity is inherent in the application domain. Some business process are more complex
than other due to their domain, while additional complexity is introduced by the strategies
and design options used to implement workflows. To manage and control the complexity of
workflows and kept it within an acceptable range, it is necessary to develop methods,
algorithms and tools to measure their complexity. Measurement is a key to strategic
planning. As Lord Kelvin, a noted mathematician once said: “If you can measure
something and put a number to it, you can begin to understand it. If you cannot measure it,
you have a very sorry ability to understand it...” Indeed, as Burbeck (Burbeck 1996) points
out, once complexity has gotten out of control, it takes control. From all the different
algorithms and methods that can be devised to measure workflow complexity, each one has
its own peculiar features, its strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, in this paper we
investigate complexities that arise in the development of workflows and suggest the
adaptation of complexity measures from other fields of science to measure the complexity
of workflows.
2 Are workflows complex systems?
To answer to the question “Are workflows complex systems?” we need to define and
understand what a complex system is. According to several authors, complex systems are
systems with the following characteristics:
• Structure – A complex system is a highly structured system, which shows
structure with variations (Goldenfeld and Kadanoff 1999)
• Arrangements – Complex systems have a large number of possible arrangements
of its parts (Kauffman 1993; Holland 1995; Bar-Yam 1997)
• Interaction – A complex system is one in which there are multiple interactions
between many different parts (Rind 1999)
• Inference – Structure and behavior cannot be inferred from the structure and
behavior of its parts (Kauffman 1993; Holland 1995; Bar-Yam 1997).

• Response – Parts can adjust in response to changes in adjacent parts (Kauffman
1993; Holland 1995; Bar-Yam 1997).
• Understandability – A complex system is one that by design or function, or both,
is difficult to understand and verify (Weng, Bhalla et al. 1999)
• Complexity – Complexity can be a measure of a complex system for
characterization and comparison.
In biology, and other related sciences, complex systems have a slightly different sense.
The term complex system refers to a system with similar characteristics with the one we
have given but the parts are coupled in a nonlinear fashion and are described using
mathematical models from dynamic systems, which include differential equations.
Figure 1. A workflow as a complex system
These definitions for the term complex system allow us to conclude that workflows are
indeed complex systems. Let us see how this conclusion can be reached. By definition,
workflows are an ordered (i.e., structure) group of business activities (i.e., components or
part of a system) undertaken by an organization to achieve a goal. Activities take one or
more kind of inputs and create outputs. The outputs of some activities are the inputs or
other activities (i.e., interaction). A workflow rarely operates in isolation, i.e. other
workflows will depend on it and it will depend on other workflows (i.e., interaction). The
measures presented in (Lakshmanan, Jayaprakash et al. 1991; Cardoso 2005; Cardoso
2005; Cardoso 2005; Cardoso 2005; Rolón, Ruíz et al. 2005; Cardoso 2006; Gruhn and
Laue 2006; Gruhn and Laue 2006) can be used to characterizes and compare workflows
(i.e., complexity). Some workflows have a high number of activities and an elaborated
design (i.e., understandability). Examples include workflows that model receiving orders,
marketing services, selling products, delivering services, distributing products, and
invoicing for services. Additionally, knowing the structure and behavior of each activity
does not allow deducing the structure and behavior of a workflow (i.e., inference).
Adaptation technique (Hermann 1995; Miller, Cardoso et al. 2002; Adams, Edmond et al.
2003; Cardoso and Sheth 2005) can be used to change the structure of a workflow and its
activities when it does not meet initial requirements (i.e., response). A workflow links a set
of activities with a specific start and finish point that describe a process, but there is most of
the time more than one way to arrange the activities of a workflow to achieve an
organizational goal (i.e., arrangements).

3 Workflow complexity
According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, complexity is: a) something complex and
b) the quality or state of being complex. These definitions take us back to the concept of
complex. The same dictionary defines the term complex as something composed of two or
more parts or which is hard to separate, analyze, or solve. These particular definitions are
not too useful, since they are rather vague to define precisely what workflow complexity is.
Bar-Yam (Bar-Yam 1997) states that the complexity of a system is strongly connected to
its number of possible states and the information needed to describe the system. This
definition is attractive, but when applied to workflows it is too restrictive. We believe that
several complexity metrics can be devised based on the structure, parts and organization of
workflows. This means that two distinct workflows, possibly with the same number of
states and that require the same amount of information to describe them, can have a
different complexity.
Christopher Alexander (Alexander 1979) associates complexity with the relations among
the entities which interact and the result of those relations. Alexander’s notion of
complexity considers the notion of “order.” Order takes use to the idea of dynamic system.
It is associated with the action of doing something. On the other hand, we can also consider
that complexity can be passive, where the order of states is not taken into account but only
the properties of states. As a result, the order of a system, which describes the relationships
among the parts of a system, can be a complexity a measure, but the individual parts of the
systems can also contribute to complexity and, therefore, need to be measured.
We believe that from the different definitions that have been given for the term
complexity, the most adequate ones come from the field of software engineering. Several
definitions have been given to describe the meaning of software complexity (Zuse 1997).
After analyzing the characteristics and specific aspects of workflows, we believe that the
definition that is better suited to describe workflow complexity can be derived from the
Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology (IEEE 1992). Therefore, we
define workflow complexity as the degree to which a process is difficult to analyze,
understand or explain. It may be characterized by the number and intricacy of activity
interfaces, transitions, conditional and parallel branches, the existence of loops, roles,
activity categories, the types of data structures, and other workflow characteristics.
4 Ordered, structured and random workflows
When we view workflows as complex systems, we are interested in their complexity.
We can identify three types of workflows that have a distinct complexity based on their
structure: ordered, structured, and random workflows. Ordered workflows are perceived as
simple, while random workflows are at the other end of the complexity scale, whatever that
scale may be. Structured workflows are deemed to lie somewhere in between. From Figure
2 we can see that complexity can be related to the general idea of a relationship between
structure and complexity, as the consensus is that random workflows do not possess any
structure.

Figure 2. Ordered, structured and random workflows
Workflows are not static complex systems. They are constantly undergoing revisions,
adaptations, changes, and modifications to meet end users needs. The complexity of
workflows tends to increase as they are maintained over a period of time. Workflows may
even require to be reengineered when their behavior is no longer satisfactory or their
complexity has reached an upper threshold. Indeed, a workflow that is initially ordered can
easily, with time, change and become a structured one, if no precautions are taken, it can
even become a random workflow. The typical evolution of workflows is illustrated in
Figure 3.

5 Perspectives on Workflow Complexity
Workflow specifications can be understood from a number of different perspectives.
Aalst and Hofstede (Aalst and Hofstede 2005) discuss three main perspectives: control-
flow, data, and resource perspectives. We extend this categorization adding the activity
perceptive. This perspective views activities in isolation without taking into account the

control-flow that interconnects activities. It will become clear that this perspective is very
useful to evaluate the complexity of workflows. For each perspective, one or more
