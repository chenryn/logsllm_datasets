EFF Proposed Exception
Proposed Class #1:  Computer programs that enable 
wireless telephone handsets to execute lawfully 
obtained software applications, where circumvention 
is accomplished for the sole purpose of enabling 
interoperability of such applications with computer 
programs on the telephone handset.

DMCA Violation
“Apple is opposed to the proposed Class #1 exemption 
because it will destroy the technological protection of 
Apple’s key copyrighted computer programs in the 
iPhone™ device itself and of copyrighted content owned 
by Apple that plays on the iPhone, resulting in 
copyright infringement, potential damage to the 
device and other potential harmful physical effects, 
adverse effects on the functioning of the device, and 
breach of contract.”

System & Network Hacking
Standard iPhone / iPod Touch is fairly neutered
Bad Laws:

behavior in conducting a zone transfer was 
unauthorized within the meaning of the North 
Dakota Computer Crime Law” - Judge Rothe-Seeger, Case number

    Social Engineering
iPod Touch vs. Laptop
Assume it’s a Phone
Unaware of its use as a hacking platform
“Texting” is socially acceptable
