In OSGI `@Configurable` mechanism works well only when used in one bundle.  
If there is  in application contexts of more then
one bundle, the AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect (single instance) is injected
with two different BeanConfigurerSupport objects in non deterministic order.  
Bundle whose BeanFactory is injected to aspect most recently works well -
others don't work at all.
Is there any work around for this problem?
