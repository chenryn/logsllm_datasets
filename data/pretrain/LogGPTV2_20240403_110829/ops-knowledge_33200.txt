User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释常见日志如下所示
 0 11:14:53,074 INFO Sending DIFF
 1 19:30:10,729 WARN Send worker leaving thread
 2 19:24:19,011 WARN Send worker leaving thread
 3 19:22:36,642 WARN Send worker leaving thread
 4 19:24:26,230 WARN Send worker leaving thread
 5 19:35:14,605 WARN Send worker leaving thread
日志最前面三部分别为序号、时间戳和日志Level，在不考虑这三部分内容的情况下，此处我们设定日志的变量用'<*>'代替，token与token之间用空格分隔，那么请问上述日志的日志模版具体是什么？

A: Sending DIFF 和 Send worker leaving thread
B: Received connection request /<*>:<*> 和 Interrupted while waiting for message on queue
C: Notification time out: <*> 和 Closed socket connection for client /<*>:<*> which had sessionid <*>
D: Connection broken for id <*>, my id = <*>, error = 和 Closed socket connection for client /<*>:<*> which had sessionid <*>

Assistant: Answer: A
