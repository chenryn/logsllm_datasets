analysis engine as a future work.
Applying emulation to build an IoT honeypot. Arbitrated em-
ulation can also be useful to build a honeypot for analyzing numer-
ous attacks targeting IoT devices. In fact, there have been several
honeypot studies utilizing emulation [35, 47, 49, 57]. Particularly,
Vetterl et al. [57] proposed a honeypot named Honware based on
firmware emulation similarly to FirmAE’s approach. As a honeypot
should interact with an attacker outside the network, the authors
focused on increasing the network reachability rate by investigating
emulation failure cases. Accordingly, FirmAE’s network interven-
tion that configures a default network setting is fairly similar to
Honware’s approach. However, FirmAE includes additional inter-
ventions to run web services for actively analyzing vulnerabilities
in them, and such interventions even more increased the emulation
rate (Table 5). Thus, we believe that arbitrated emulation can be
useful to build an IoT honeypot as well.2
7 CONCLUSION
Analysis of embedded device security has received considerable at-
tention. In this study, we investigated a large-scale firmware dataset
and discovered that firmware emulation can substantially benefit
from simple interventions. We proposed arbitrated emulation and
interventions that can address high-level failure problems. With a
prototype, FirmAE, we demonstrated that the proposed approach
can boost the emulation rate of the state-of-the-art framework
by 487%. We also performed dynamic analysis on the emulated
firmware and found 23 unique vulnerabilities, including 12 0-days.
