### Future Work: Analysis Engine and IoT Honeypot

#### Applying Emulation for IoT Honeypot Construction
Arbitrated emulation can be a valuable tool in building an IoT honeypot for the analysis of various attacks targeting IoT devices. Several studies have already explored the use of emulation in creating honeypots [35, 47, 49, 57]. Notably, Vetterl et al. [57] introduced Honware, a honeypot based on firmware emulation, similar to FirmAE's approach. To ensure that the honeypot can interact with attackers outside the network, the authors focused on increasing the network reachability rate by addressing emulation failure cases. This is akin to FirmAE's network intervention, which configures a default network setting. However, FirmAE goes further by including additional interventions to run web services, enabling active vulnerability analysis. These interventions significantly increased the emulation rate (Table 5). Therefore, we believe that arbitrated emulation can be effectively utilized to build an IoT honeypot.

### Conclusion
The analysis of embedded device security has garnered significant attention. In this study, we examined a large-scale firmware dataset and found that firmware emulation can greatly benefit from simple interventions. We proposed arbitrated emulation and associated interventions to address high-level failure problems. Using our prototype, FirmAE, we demonstrated that the proposed approach can increase the emulation rate of state-of-the-art frameworks by 487%. Additionally, we performed dynamic analysis on the emulated firmware, identifying 23 unique vulnerabilities, including 12 zero-day vulnerabilities.
