I encountered issues while using the `@types/superagent@3.5.5` package in a browser environment (not Node.js). Here is a detailed description of the problem and the steps I have taken so far:

1. **Package and TypeScript Version:**
   - I am using the `@types/superagent@3.5.5` package.
   - The TypeScript compiler version is `2.4.2`, which is bundled with `zc-react-scripts@1.1.1`. I am building a React + TypeScript application using [create-react-app](https://github.com/zhenwenc/create-react-app).

2. **Issue Description:**
   - When I import `superagent` in my browser environment, it unconditionally imports `@types/node`, which injects global type definitions for the Node.js environment.
   - As a result, the TypeScript compiler tells me that `setTimeout` returns `NodeJS.Timer` instead of `number`, which is incorrect in a browser context. There should be no `NodeJS` types in the browser.

3. **Steps Taken:**
   - I tried using the latest stable version of TypeScript (`tsc`), but the issue persists.
   - I have a question that is not appropriate for StackOverflow. If you have any questions that are suitable for StackOverflow, please ask them there.

4. **Authors to Mention:**
   - The authors of the type definitions for `superagent` are @NicoZelaya, @mxl, and @paplorinc. I would appreciate their input on this issue.

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this problem.
