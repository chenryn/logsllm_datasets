I'm using `superagent` in the browser environment (not Node). Importing
`superagent` loads type definitions `@types/superagent` which unconditionally
imports `@types/node` which injects global type definitions for Node
environment. After that, the TypeScript compiler tells me that `setTimeout`
returns `NodeJS.Timer` while I expect it to return `number` because there
should be no `NodeJS` in the browser.
I'm not using the latest `tsc` because I'm building a React+TypeScript app via
https://github.com/zhenwenc/create-react-app https://www.npmjs.com/package/zc-
react-scripts â€“  
`typescript@2.4.2` is bundled with the latest version `zc-react-scripts@1.1.1`
at the time of writing.
