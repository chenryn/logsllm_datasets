Question: An Android application developer is designing a security feature that involves generating a key pair for digital signing and requires attestation of the new keys. The developer needs to ensure that the attestation process is secure and aligns with recommended practices. Which of the following steps would be considered secure and recommended for attestation of keys in an Android environment?
"A": "Using a nonce of at least 16 bytes for the attestation challenge to prevent replays of older attestation certificates.",
"B": "Reusing the attestation challenge for multiple requests to reduce computational overhead.",
"C": "Requesting attestation without specifying any hardware identifiers for improved privacy.",
"D": "Generating the key pair directly without a challenge, relying on the device's secure environment to ensure authenticity."
Answer: A
