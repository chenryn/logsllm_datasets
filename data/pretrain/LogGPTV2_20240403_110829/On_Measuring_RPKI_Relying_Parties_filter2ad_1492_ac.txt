In this paper, we presented a new reproducible RPKI measurement
framework that focuses on the relying party cache servers to high-
light their role in providing a complete and timely view of RPKI
data. Our child CA and publication point deployment model ushers
in the next stage in RPKI system understanding. Our initial results
show a significant portion of deployed RPs are not obtaining a com-
plete nor timely copy of RPKI data. Refresh intervals are crucial,
but we have also identified systemic behavior by multiple imple-
mentations that may cause them to lose access to child CAs and
PPs. Our study shows this problem may currently exist for up to
20% of deployed RPs. Considering that there is an increasing trend
of both deployment of child CAs and RPKI-based route filtering,
Internet routing may experience larger disturbances in the future
if the erroneous fetching behavior of RPs is not fixed.
Our approach allows for greater data transparency, enabling RP
connection data to be shared and made available to third parties.
We will run and extend our measurement platform in the future. We
plan to include child CAs and PPs under all RIRs. This is important,
because as we have seen some operators choose not to accept the
licensing agreement of one of the five RIRs in practice. Future work
will help us understand how widespread these decisions are.
We also seek to further examine RP cache servers directly, to
complement the completeness work started here. It is not enough
to know that an RP contacted a publication point, it is important to
also know what the outcome of the contact was. Are RPs adhering
to certificate expiration dates? Do RPs correctly validate all ROAs?
Are there ROAs that trigger different validation results across RP
deployments, perhaps due to policy or implementation differences?
Finally, we will investigate whether we can leverage this new
data source outside of the RPKI context such as extending IP hit
lists by RP addresses.

A ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
We release all data gathered at our delegated CAs on https://rp-
study.rpki.net. This will include IP addresses of the relying parties.
We do not consider this data privacy-sensitive as the RPKI is a
public repository.

C RP SOFTWARE POPULARITY
Figure 8 shows the number of distinct RP IP addresses that fetch data via
RRDP and are visible at our research PP. We map each RP to RP software
based on the user agent string in HTTP.
E CONNECTION INTERVALS
Figure 10 shows the refresh intervals of RPs measured at our research PP.
Details for AFRINIC and APNIC are presented in Section 3.3.
Figure 8: RP software popularity. Note: Research PP re-
enabled RRDP on 2020-12-25.
D SET DIAGRAM OF RP IP ADDRESSES
Figure 9 shows the overlap of distinct RP IP addresses for a single day,
measured across all three PPs.
