User: For example, when I type:
child = Popen('cmd'), how does the interpreter know where to look for cmd? and if I want to use my custom process, where do I put it that it will get recognized?
Assistant: It will look in the directories in the PATH environment variable.  But you can always specify an absolute or relative path, so if you know where your custom process is located, you can just give the full path to it.
