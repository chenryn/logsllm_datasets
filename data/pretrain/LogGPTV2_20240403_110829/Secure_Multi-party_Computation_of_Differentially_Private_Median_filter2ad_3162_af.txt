dian computation with high accuracy (even for small num-
ber of users), without a trusted party, that is efﬁciently com-
putable (practical running time) and scaleable (sublinear in
the size of the universe). Our semi-honest multi-party proto-
col implements the exponential mechanism for decomposable
aggregate functions (e.g., rank-based statistics) as used in
MapRedue-style algorithms, and can be extended to mali-
cious parties. For the median, the exponential mechanism
provides the best utility vs. privacy trade-off for low ε in our
evaluations of related work in the central model.
We optimize our protocol for decomposable functions (al-
lowing efﬁcient MPC on distributed data), and use efﬁcient
alternatives to exponentiations for ﬂoating-point numbers.
We implemented our protocol in the SCALE-MAMBA frame-
work [6], and evaluated it for 1 million users using 3 semi-
honest computation parties achieving a running time of sec-
onds in a LAN, and 3 minutes in a WAN (100 ms latency,
100 Mbits/s bandwidth).

A Distributed Differential Privacy
The original deﬁnition of Differential Privacy considers the
central model with unbounded adversaries [25,28] (see Deﬁni-
tion 1), later work expanded it to a distributed setting [26,44],
and considered computationally-bounded parties [54].
We consider multiple computationally-bounded, semi-
honest parties performing a joint secure computation realized
with (t,m)-secret sharing. The following deﬁnition from [30]
ﬁts our setting, where VIEWp
Π(D) denotes the view of party
p during the execution of protocol Π on input D, including
all exchanged messages and internal state, and λ is a security
parameter:
Deﬁnition 7 (Distributed Differential Privacy). A randomized
protocol Π implemented among m computation parties P =
{P1, . . . ,Pm}, achieves distributed differential privacy w.r.t. a
coalition C ⊂ P of semi-honest computation parties of size t,
if the following condition holds: for any neighbors D,D(cid:48) and
any possible set S of views for protocol Π,
