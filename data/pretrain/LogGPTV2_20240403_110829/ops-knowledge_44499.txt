User: How to use Nagios to monitor a server group, and send an email or SMS to notify the administrator when a failure occurs?
Assistant: This process needs to cover the following steps: 1. Install and configure Nagios Core on the Nagios server. 2. Create a new host group on the Nagios server and add all servers to be monitored to this group. 3. Create a new service group on the Nagios server and add services to the group, such as SSH, HTTP, SMTP, etc. 4. Install and configure notification plugins (such as Email, SMS/Text) and integrate them into Nagios. 5. Set the notification method (email or SMS) in the Nagios configuration file, and add the notification contact (that is, the administrator) to the file. 6. Configure thresholds and alert conditions for Nagios monitoring to detect server failures or problems. 7. Test alerts and notifications on the Nagios server to ensure proper functionality. It should be noted that the above steps are not detailed step descriptions, and the details and configuration of each step need to be determined according to the actual situation and needs. It is recommended to follow the Nagios documentation and refer to each step for better results.
