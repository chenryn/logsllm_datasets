need to emit a 2.0 warning for this, no magic SQL things like this should
happen
        def distinct(self, *expr):
            r"""Apply a ``DISTINCT`` to the query and return the newly resulting
            ``Query``.
            .. note::
                The :meth:`.distinct` call includes logic that will automatically
                add columns from the ORDER BY of the query to the columns
                clause of the SELECT statement, to satisfy the common need
                of the database backend that ORDER BY columns be part of the
                SELECT list when DISTINCT is used.   These columns *are not*
                added to the list of columns actually fetched by the
                :class:`.Query`, however, so would not affect results.
                The columns are passed through when using the
                :attr:`.Query.statement` accessor, however.
