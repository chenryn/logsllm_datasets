User: I'm trying to create a scheduled task using the Unix at command. I wanted to run a python script, but quickly realized that at is configured to use run whatever file I give it with sh. In an attempt to circumvent this, I created a file that contained the command python mypythonscript.py and passed that to at instead.
I have set the permissions on the python file to executable by everyone (chmod a+x), but when the at job runs, I am told python: can't open file 'mypythonscript.py': [Errno 13] Permission denied.
If I run source myshwrapperscript.sh, the shell script invokes the python script fine. Is there some obvious reason why I'm having permissions problems with at?
Edit: I got frustrated with the python script, so I went ahead and made a sh script version of the thing I wanted to run. I am now finding that the sh script returns to me saying rm: cannot remove <filename>: Permission denied (this was a temporary file I was creating to store intermediate data). Is there anyway I can authorize these operations with my own credentials, despite not having sudo access? All of this works perfectly when I run it myself, but everything seems to go to shit when I have at do it.
Assistant: Start the script using python not the actual script name, ex : python path/to/script.py.
at tries to run everything as a sh script.
