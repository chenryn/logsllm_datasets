In `dev` environment we're using a custom email constraint validator that's
being created by decorating the shipped email constraint validator:
        app.dev.validator.email:
            class: AppBundle\Validator\DevelopmentEmailValidator
            public: false
            decorates: validator.email
            arguments: ["@app.dev.validator.email.inner"]
After updating to 3.1.5 we're running into problems with the missing class
`InvalidArgumentException` because it enters the `$definition->isPublic()` if
in line 33 of `AddConstraintValidatorsPass.php`. That has been fixed with
commit #32451b1a092181b793ee6bd186eeb7a3ca039491. But the underlying problem
still persists. Due to the service decoration the
`$definition->isPublic()`-check fails on the `app.dev.validator.email.inner`
service.
Don't know whether this is the expected behavior. If so, what would be the
_new_ way to replace shipped constraint validators?
