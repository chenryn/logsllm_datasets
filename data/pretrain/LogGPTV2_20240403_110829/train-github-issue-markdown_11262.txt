In our `dev` environment, we are using a custom email constraint validator that extends the default email constraint validator through decoration. The service configuration is as follows:

```yaml
app.dev.validator.email:
    class: AppBundle\Validator\DevelopmentEmailValidator
    public: false
    decorates: validator.email
    arguments: ["@app.dev.validator.email.inner"]
```

After upgrading to version 3.1.5, we encountered an issue where the system throws an `InvalidArgumentException` due to a missing class. This error occurs because the `$definition->isPublic()` check in line 33 of `AddConstraintValidatorsPass.php` fails. The specific issue was addressed in commit #32451b1a092181b793ee6bd186eeb7a3ca039491; however, the underlying problem persists. Specifically, the `$definition->isPublic()` check still fails for the `app.dev.validator.email.inner` service due to the service decoration.

We are unsure if this behavior is expected. If it is, what would be the recommended approach for replacing the default constraint validators in the new version?
