Abstract. An IMSI Catcher, also known as Stingray or rogue cell, is
a device that can be used to not only locate cellular phones, but also
to intercept communication content like phone calls, SMS or data trans-
mission unbeknown to the user. They are readily available as commercial
products as well as do-it-yourself projects running open-source software,
and are obtained and used by law enforcement agencies and criminals
alike. Multiple countermeasures have been proposed recently to detect
such devices from the user’s point of view, but they are limited to the
nearby vicinity of the user.
In this paper we are the ﬁrst to present and discuss multiple detection
capabilities from the network operator’s point of view, and evaluate them
on a real-world cellular network in cooperation with an European mobile
network operator with over four million subscribers. Moreover, we draw
a comprehensive picture on current threats against mobile phone devices
and networks, including 2G, 3G and 4G IMSI Catchers and present detec-
tion and mitigation strategies under the unique large-scale circumstances
of a real European carrier. One of the major challenges from the oper-
ator’s point of view is that cellular networks were speciﬁcally designed
to reduce global signaling traﬃc and to manage as many transactions
regionally as possible. Hence, contrary to popular belief, network opera-
tors by default do not have a global view or their network. Our proposed
solution can be readily added to existing network monitoring infrastruc-
tures and includes among other things plausibility checks of location
update trails, monitoring of device-speciﬁc round trip times and an oﬄine
detection scheme to detect cipher downgrade attacks, as commonly used
by commercial IMSI Catchers.
1 Introduction
IMSI Catchers are MITM (Man-in-The-Middle) devices for cellular networks [28].
Originally developed to steal IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
numbers from nearby phones, later versions oﬀered call- and message interception.
Today, IMSI Catchers are used to (i) track handsets, (ii) deliver geo-target spam
[32], (iii) send operator messages that reconﬁgure the phone (e.g., installing a per-
manent MITM by setting a new APN, http-proxy, or attack the management inter-
face [39]), (iv) directly attack SIM cards with encrypted SMS [33] that are ﬁltered

by most operators by now, and (v) also can potentially intercept mobile two-factor
authentication schemes (mTAN). IMSI Catchers have become aﬀordable, and can
be build for less then USD 1,500 [14]. Pell and Soghoian [36] argue that we are cur-
rently on the brink of age where almost everyone is able to eavesdrop phone calls,
similar to the 1990ies when cheap analog scanners were used to listen to mobile
phones in the US and Europe.
In brief, these devices exploit the phone’s behavior of preferring the strongest
cell phone tower signal in the vicinity to maximize the signal quality and mini-
mize its own power consumption. Additionally, on GSM networks (2G), only the
phone (via the SIM - Subscriber Identiﬁcation Module) needs to authenticate to
the network, but not vice versa and can therefore be easily deluded to disable
content data encryption. This enables an attacker to answer a phone’s requests
as if the phone was communicating with a legitimate cell phone network.
In contrast, the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS, 3G)
and Long Term Evolution (LTE, 4G) require mutual two-way authentication,
but are still not completely immune to IMSI Catchers. Tracking and identifying
IMSI Catchers are build on the weakness that a network has to be able to identify
its subscriber before it can authenticate him/her. Additionally, unauthenticated
commands can be used to downgrade a phone into using 3G or the less secure 2G
(GSM) only, eventually giving way to a full Man-in-the-Middle attack. Addition-
ally, some phones execute unauthenticated commands, even though the standard
demands prior authentication [35].
This issue gains additional momentum as commercial networks increasingly
surpass dedicated administrative and governmental networks in coverage and
data rates and thus carry more and more increasingly sensitive data. Addition-
ally, today, many economic sectors critically depend on a reliable and secure
mobile communication infrastructure (e.g., logistics).
While previous work [15,31,34,37,40] mainly focused on the detection of
rouge base stations on the consumer side, this paper takes the approach from
the network operator’s perspective and discusses novel detection capabilities
from an academic as well as practical point of view.
The cooperation with a mobile phone network operator with over four million
subscribers enabled us to test theories, identify detection artifacts and generate
statistics out of core network data. We focused on passive detection methods,
readily available data in today’s monitoring solutions and the identiﬁcation of
changes that promise better detectability and scalability.
The scope of this paper is the detection of attacks on the radio access network
(RAN) in 2G (GE/RAN), 3G (UTRAN), and LTE networks (E-UTRAN). While
there are attacks on the backbone and interconnection interface, or within a
mobile network provider, we focus on the last-mile radio link between the cell
tower and the terminal device. The traditional telecommunication network model
centers all the intelligence in the network and attaches (dumb) end devices that
have to obey the network. Thus, these types of attacks give an attacker a lot of
control over the end user device.

The pivotal sections of the paper are as follows:
– Evaluation of 22 phones on (i) how they interact with the genuine network
once released from an IMSI Catcher (Sect. 5.1) and (ii) which artifacts are
produced.
– Development and implementation of detection strategies based on the artifacts
and test of their ﬁtness including their limitations on real-world data of a
network operator (Sects. 5 and 6)
2 Background
Previous work [15,31,34,37,40] focused on the subscriber (customer) side; this
paper shifts perspectives and addresses the detection of such attacks from the
operator side. The particular challenge lies in the structure of digital mobile
networks: They where drafted in a time of low bandwidth connections, when
signaling traﬃc occupied a signiﬁcant amount of the network infrastructure.
Therefore, these networks were designed in a highly hierarchical and geographi-
cally distributed fashion with as much signaling traﬃc as possible being handled
locally or regionally, thus, oﬄoading the backbone. This poses unique challenges
when acquiring and correlating the necessary data in order to detect anomalies in
the network. Additionally, the legacy of having a GSM network being upgraded
to UMTS and later again upgraded to LTE implies that the structure and the
used data formats are not as clean and neat as one would expect from a freshly
built LTE network with additional 2G and 3G radio front-ends.
Compared to the time when 2G networks were designed, today the ratio
between user data and signaling data has completely changed. With LTE, users
are oﬀered 100 MBit or more.
The lowered backbone bandwidth costs and the (now) relatively low volume
of signaling data allows mobile phone operators to en-bloc collect and monitor
more data parameters than before. Many cellular network operators routinely
collect data on diﬀerent network levels and elements (e.g., from switches, servers,
and via network probes) to detect, track and debug malfunctions and optimize
their network. The strength of such Network Intelligence systems is to correlate
transactions over diﬀerent levels and protocols in the network structure, extract
important values, and build an extensive index of the latter. This is done for
several million signaling packets per minute. The limitation is that these indices
are primarily built to search for traﬃc based on simple identiﬁers such as a
speciﬁc customer, network element, protocol, or transaction type. Our goal is to
use this monitoring systems to ﬁnd far more complex symptom patterns that
are typically produced by IMSI Catchers.
2.1 Working Principles of a Mobile Phone Network
Mobile phone networks became much more complex over the years. Each new
generation or access technology (e.g., 2G GSM, 3G UMTS, 4G LTE) introduced
282

a new terminology which complicates the description in an access-technology-
neutral fashion.
For example, the base station (the radio front end of the network) with
roughly the same functionality is called Base Transceiver Station (BTS) in
GSM, Node B in UMTS, and evolved Node B (eNodeB or eNB) in LTE. Like-
wise, a mobile phone is called Mobile Station (MS) in GSM and User Equip-
ment (UE) in UMTS as well as LTE. However, apart from the radio layer and
some distinct organizational diﬀerences, they have many similarities on higher
(more abstract) levels. Regardless of the access technology, the network needs
to know how and (roughly) where to reach every subscriber, even when they are
idle. This is solved by grouping radio cells into Location Areas (GSM, UMTS),
Routing Areas (GPRS, UMTS; a subdivision of a Location Area), or Track-
ing Areas (LTE). In the phone’s idle state, the network only knows the Loca-
tion/Routing/Tracking Area where the subscriber is located, but not the exact
cell. The phone (MS, UE) can listen to the broadcast channel of any cell as an
incoming phone call, message, or data triggers a paging of the subscriber in all
cells of a Location/Routing/Tracking Area. Upon a received page, the phone
will contact the network and request a dedicated (logical) channel for further
communication, thus giving away its position on cell level.
Only if the UE/MS switches to another Location/Tracking Area, it will tell
the network about it, using a Location Update Request (GSM, UMTS) or Track-
ing Area Update (LTE). This method substantially reduces the signaling traﬃc
caused by the subscribers’ mobility.
In general, all subscribers are not identiﬁed by their phone ID (the 14-digit
International Mobile Equipment Identity, IMEI), but by their Subscriber Iden-
tity Module (SIM) on GSM, orUniversal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) on
UMTS and LTE which provides a 15-digit unique International Mobile Sub-
scriber Identity (IMSI). However, sending the IMSI over the air would make
subscribers easily trackable. Therefore, the network frequently (re)assigns a Tem-
porary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) that is used instead1 of the IMSI on
2G and 3G. 4G extends the TMSI by multiple Radio Network Temporary Iden-
tiﬁers (RNTI) for diﬀerent use cases (e.g., paging, random access). TMSIs are
meant to be reassigned on Location/Tracking Area changes, and some networks
even reassign them on every interaction (e.g., call, text message) between the
phone (MS, UE) and the network.
On a Location/Tracking Area Update message the phone will (usually) trans-
mit its current TMSI and the old Location Area Identity (LAI, consisting of the
Mobile Country Code MCC, Mobile Network Code MNC, and the Location Area
Code LAC on GSM and UMTS) or Tracking Area Identity (TAI, comprising
MCC, MNC, and the Tracking Area Code TAC). The Mobile Switching Cen-
ter (MSC) for a Location/Tracking Area can now fetch all the data about the
subscriber from the old Location/Tracking Area and inform the central user
database (Home Location Register HLR on GSM and UMTS, Home Subscriber
Server HSS on LTE) about where to reach that subscriber from now on.

Location/Tracking Area Update Messages are the Swiss army knife of the
Mobility Management (MM) in mobile networks: A phone freshly turned on
will ﬁrst try to make a Location/Tracking Area Update Request (LUR, TAUR)
using its last known (cached) values. If its TMSI hasn’t expired and is valid
in this Location/Tracking Area, the network will accept the phone. Otherwise
it will trigger a re-authentication. Therefore, even a phone arriving on a plane
from another continent will ﬁrst try to perform an LUR/TAUR providing the
LAI/TAI data from another network. This is intended, as it allows for national
roaming and seamless handover of active calls across an international border. (In
LTE, the network can additionally provide an individual set of Tracking Areas
for each UE, so that a group of subscribers – e.g., on a train – do not perform
a Tracking Area Update all at once.)
Additionally, a ME/UE will perform periodic Location/Tracking updates,
even when not moved in an interval conﬁgured by the network (e.g., 24 h) to
assure the network of its continued presence.
Periodically during operation and at shutdown, parts of the baseband state
are stored on the SIM card and the phone itself. For example, instead of per-
forming a full frequency scan for all receivable base stations at power on, the
phone will ﬁrst try the frequency range where it received signals from its mobile
phone network before. Also, it will retry its old TMSI in an attempt to speed up
the procedure. (After all, if the phone has not been oﬄine for too long, it still
could be valid.)
3 Capabilities of IMSI Catchers
In general, IMSI Catchers come in two variants: (i) a tracking or identifying
IMSI Catcher and (ii) capturing or Man-in-the-Middle IMSI Catchers. The ﬁrst
read out speciﬁc data from a phone or launch a speciﬁc attack before releasing
the phone back into the genuine network. This is useful for enumerating phones
in the vicinity or check for a speciﬁc device in radio range. The latter holds the
phone captured in its fake cell and can relay traﬃc to the outside world.
While IMSI Catchers originally exploit a speciﬁc vulnerability in 2G net-
works, they are still a relevant threat in 3G and LTE networks, for several
reasons: First, the weakest-link principle applies. As long as users can be delib-
erately downgraded to a less secure system, the weakest link sets the limit.
Additionally, it has been recently shown that IMSI Catchers are possible on 3G
and 4G in either a tracking-only setup or for full traﬃc interception in combina-
