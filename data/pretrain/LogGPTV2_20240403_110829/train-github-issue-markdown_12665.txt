**Report by astrange:**

When running the binary distribution of Go 1.2 (or any of its release candidates) on our FreeBSD 9.2 servers, the application immediately crashes. The same issue occurs when using `go_bootstrap` to build Go from source. However, Go 1.1 runs without any problems.

### System Information
- **uname -a:**
  ```
  FreeBSD yyy 9.2-RELEASE FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE #6: Sun Oct 13 05:14:05 EDT 2013 xxx@yyy:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/ZZZ amd64
  ```

- **GOROOT:**
  ```sh
  setenv GOROOT `pwd`
  ```

- **Number of CPUs:**
  ```sh
  sysctl hw.ncpu
  hw.ncpu: 16
  ```

The crash appears to be related to a `SIGBUS` (bus error) in the `runtime.sysctl` function, which is part of the Go runtime. This issue does not occur with Go 1.1.
