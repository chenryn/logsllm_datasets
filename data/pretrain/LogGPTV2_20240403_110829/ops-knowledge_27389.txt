User: An e-commerce company needs to redesign their server architecture to meet new business needs. Please provide a reasonable server architecture design plan.
Assistant: In order to meet the new business needs of e-commerce companies, it is recommended to adopt a microservice architecture design solution. Specifically, it includes the following layers: 1. Pre-load balancing layer: This layer can use CDN content distribution network technology to distribute massive access traffic to specific service nodes, thereby avoiding excessive pressure on a single node. At the same time, reverse proxy technology can be used to forward requests to appropriate service nodes for processing. 2. API gateway layer: API gateway technologies such as Kong and Zuul can be used at this layer to conduct unified routing and control of requests from the front load balancing layer, and perform a series of responsibilities such as authority authentication, current limiting, and circuit breaker. 3. Microservice layer: This layer can adopt open source microservice frameworks such as Spring Cloud and Dubbo to realize the independent deployment and operation of each business function module, and decompose the original single application into multiple small services, each of which only focuses on A specific business need. Improve system scalability and stability by optimizing service communication and data storage. 4. Data layer: This layer can adopt distributed database, cache and other technologies to realize multi-node data storage and read-write consistency, and improve the data access efficiency and processing capacity of the system. Open source technologies such as MySQL, Redis, and Hadoop are recommended. Generally speaking, the above server architecture design scheme is based on the distributed system of the Internet. After actual verification, it can realize many requirements such as high availability, high concurrency, and high performance of the business system. However, specific architectural strategies may need to be fine-tuned and optimized for different business scenarios and scales.
