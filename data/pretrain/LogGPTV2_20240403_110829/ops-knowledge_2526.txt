User: I have a directory with 94 subdirectories, each containing one or two files *.fastq. I need to apply the same python command to each of these files and produce a new file qc_*.fastq.
I know how to apply a bash script individually to each file, but I'm wondering if there is a way to write a bash script to apply the command to all the files at once
Assistant: You can try find . -name "*.fastq" | xargs your_bash_script.sh, which use find to get all the files and apply your script to each one of them.
