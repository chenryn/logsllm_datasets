User: How to set the SSL certificate of the Nginx web server to ensure the security of data transmission?
Assistant: To set up an SSL certificate on the Nginx web server, follow the steps below: 1. Obtain a digital certificate You need to obtain a trusted digital certificate. You can obtain a certificate from one of the following sources: - Online Certificate Authority (CA): Purchase an SSL certificate and follow the steps provided to install it. - Self-signed certificate: Use the OpenSSL tool to generate a self-signed certificate. Self-signed certificates will not be recognized by browsers or operating systems, so they are not suitable for public websites. However, they can be used for internal or testing purposes. 2. Upload the certificate and private key to the server Upload the digital certificate and private key (usually created during certificate request generation) to the server. 3. Enable SSL in Nginx configuration file Open your Nginx configuration file and add the following to enable SSL: ``` server { listen 443 ssl; server_name yourdomain.com; ssl_certificate /path/to/your_domain.crt; ssl_certificate_key / path/to/your_domain.key; ... } ``` You need to replace `yourdomain.com`, `/path/to/your_domain.crt` and `/path/to/your_domain.key` with your domain name, The actual paths to the certificate and private key files. 4. Reload the Nginx configuration Save the changes and reload the Nginx configuration: ``` sudo systemctl reload nginx ``` Now your web server is SSL enabled. When a user visits your website, all data is transmitted over an encrypted connection. You can use online tools to test an SSL connection to make sure it is properly configured and functioning.
