### Dynamics of Online Scam Hosting Infrastructure

#### 1. Introduction
This paper examines the dynamics and roles of fast-flux networks in online scam campaigns. We monitored DNS records for URLs associated with scam campaigns over a one-month period, comparing their behavior to that of popular, legitimate websites. Our findings suggest that monitoring DNS infrastructure for unusual changes can help in automating the detection of scams.

#### 2. Methodology
We grouped responses from authoritative servers to account for possible load balancing and performed pairwise comparisons across different types of DNS records (A, NS, and IP of NS). A change was considered if at least one new record appeared or if the number of returned records changed. Reordering of records was not considered a change.

#### 3. Key Findings
- **Frequent Changes in Scam Domains**: Scam domains change more frequently than their TTL values, often on shorter time intervals. This is evident in the cumulative distribution of average time between changes, as shown in Figure 2.
- **Similar Rates of Change within Campaigns**: Domains within the same campaign exhibit similar rates of change. Figure 3 illustrates this for the top four campaigns, ranked by the number of distinct IPs returned in A records.

#### 4. Rate of Accumulation
- **Growth Over Time**: We measured the rate at which new hosts become active for a domain. Using a method similar to Holz et al. [4], we assigned increasing sequential IDs to previously unseen IP addresses.
- **Differences Across Campaigns**: Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the total number of distinct IPs over four weeks for the top four campaigns. The slope of the lines indicates the rate of accumulation, with steeper slopes indicating faster accumulation.
- **Dormancy and Attrition**: Some domains only start accumulating new IPs after a period of dormancy. Additionally, 10% of scam domains became unreachable during our monitoring period, possibly due to blacklisting or registrar actions.

#### 5. Location of Changes in DNS Hierarchy
- **Types of Changes**: Table 4 shows the types of changes for the top five campaigns. Unlike previous studies, we observed various types of changes, including single flux (A records) and double flux (A and IP of NS).
- **Combination of Techniques**: Each campaign often combines multiple techniques. For example, 52% of Pharmacy-A domains use double flux, while 48% change all three types of records.

#### 6. Network and Geographic Locations
- **Topological Location**: Scam sites use different portions of the IP space compared to popular legitimate content. Figure 5 shows that scam networks are less distributed, with significant differences from spammers' IP ranges.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Scam nodes are distributed across 283 ASes in 50 countries for A records, 191 ASes in 40 countries for NS records, and 2,976 IP addresses in 157 countries for spammers. This wide distribution may be necessary to accommodate the diurnal pattern of compromised hosts' uptime [3].

#### 7. Summary
Our study highlights the dynamic nature of fast-flux networks used in scam campaigns. Monitoring the DNS infrastructure for unusual, invariant changes can be a valuable tool for detecting such activities. Future work will explore this possibility further.
