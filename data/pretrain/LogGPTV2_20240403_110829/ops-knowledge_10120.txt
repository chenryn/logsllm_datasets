User: Suppose I'd like to run a python script like this: python my_script.py MY_INPUT.
In this case, MY_INPUT will be transmitted to sys.argv[1].
Is there a limit to the number of characters MY_INPUT can contain? 
Is there a limit to the type of characters MY_INPUT can contain? 
Any other limitations with regards to MY_INPUT?
UPDATE: I am using Ubuntu Linux 10.04
Assistant: Python itself doesn't impose any limitations on the length or content of sys.argv. However, your operating system and/or command shell definitely will. This question cannot be completely answered without detailed consideration of your operating environment.
