##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
role inclusion
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.4.2.0
      config file = /home/user/.ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = [u'/home/user/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
      ansible python module location = /home/user/ansible/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
      executable location = /home/user/ansible/bin/ansible
      python version = 2.7.5 (default, Aug  2 2016, 04:20:16) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4)]
##### CONFIGURATION
ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS(/home/user/.ansible.cfg) = -o Protocol=2
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Manager host is RHEL 7.3
##### SUMMARY
Playbook has a list of roles to execute. If a role is repeated multiple times
in the list, it is only executed the first time. If I use dict syntax to
invoke the role, and add parameters to the role so that the duplicate
invocations are slightly different, then the role gets executed as expected
provided there are no exact duplicates in the role arguments.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  * Create a role that just prints some debug output. Sample role below.
  * Invoke the role multiple times from a play
  * The role only executes once.
  * Edit the playbook to disambiguate the role invocations (see WORKAROUND below)
  * The role now executes once for each unique invocation
Sample role used in test:  
$ cat roles/do-nothing/tasks/main.yml
    ---
    - name: do nothing
      debug:
        var: ansible_version
Sample playbook used to reproduce:  
$ cat nothing1.yml
    ---
     - hosts: "{{ host_to_upgrade }}"
       gather_facts: false
       roles:
         - do-nothing
         - do-nothing
         - do-nothing
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
We should see the role "do-nothing" get run three times.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
    $ ansible-playbook -i ../hosts.test -e host_to_upgrade=njwdev1 nothing1.yml 
    PLAY [njwdev1] *****************************************************************
    TASK [do-nothing : do nothing] *************************************************
    ok: [njwdev1] => {
        "ansible_version": {
            "full": "2.4.2.0", 
            "major": 2, 
            "minor": 4, 
            "revision": 2, 
            "string": "2.4.2.0"
        }
    }
    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    njwdev1                    : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0   
#### WORKAROUND
This playbook shows how I'm working around the problem:
    ---
     - hosts: "{{ host_to_upgrade }}"
       gather_facts: false
       roles:
         - do-nothing
         - { role: do-nothing, disambiguate_kludge: 1 }
         - { role: do-nothing, disambiguate_kludge: 2 }
  * Note: If "disambiguate_kludge" is set to "1" instead of "2" in the 3rd role line above, then the role only executes twice.
