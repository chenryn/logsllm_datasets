Lab Study Assignment
You are the system administrator at a SME (small and
medium-sized enterprise). Your company runs a web
portal and your boss instructed you to secure the com-
munication by using TLS. Unfortunately you only have
a very limited amount of time because your company will
also soon be under security audit. This is why you should
start right away deploying TLS. Make your conﬁguration
as secure as possible.

time? (yes, no, I’m not sure)
• If you didn’t ﬁnish the TLS installation in the given
time, which steps are still missing to secure the
communication? (open text)
• How difﬁcult did you ﬁnd TLS deployment? (Likert
scale: very easy to very difﬁcult)
• What did you ﬁnd particularly difﬁcult? (open text)
• What do you think are the key usability pitfalls of
TLS deployment? (open text)
• What would you recommend a system administrator
who has to deploy TLS? (open text)
• Is there anything else you would like to let us know?

uate the security of a TLS conﬁguration?
• What are the main vulnerabilities/conﬁguration
mistakes that you encounter as an auditor?
• What botheres admins/CSOs the most regarding
TLS?
• What are the most critical steps in TLS deployment?
• How should the deployment process be improved?
• What piece of advice would you generally give to
anyone in charge of securing communication over
HTTPS?
Detailed Evaluation Criteria
Grade The overall grade for the conﬁguration with a
valid certiﬁcate. The grade is calculated based on the
grading scheme from [2]. The score is based on indi-
vidual ratings for protocol support (30%), key exchange
(30%) and cipher strength (40%). The grade is issued
based on the following cumulative scores:
• A: score >= 80
• B: score >= 65
• C: score >= 50
• D: score >= 35
• E: score >= 20
• F: score = 256: 100
Key exchange score. As described in [2], the key ex-
change phase serves two functions: (1) authentication to
verify the identity of the other party and (2) safe gener-
ation and exchange of secret keys to be used for the re-
maining session. Also, exportable key exchanges where
only a part of the key is exchanged can make the ses-
sion keys easier to compromise. Key exchange without
authentication is vulnerable to MITM attacks and allows
an attacker to gain access to the communication chan-
nel. Furthermore, the strength of the server’s private key
is crucial. The stronger it is, the more difﬁcult it is to
break the key exchange phase. Some servers use the pri-
vate key just for authentication and not for the key ex-
change mechanism. Popular algorithms are the Difﬁe-
Hellman key exchange (DHE) and its elliptic curve ver-
sion (ECDHE). As in [2], the rating is calculated as fol-
lows:
Weak key or anonymous key exchange (e.g., Anonymous
Difﬁe-Hellman): 0
Key or DH parameter strength = 4096 bits: 100
Protocol support score [2]. Several (older) versions of
TLS have known weaknesses or are vulnerable to well-
known attacks. The conﬁguration is graded as follows
with respect to the activated TLS versions. Again, if mul-
tiple versions are supported, the average between the best
and worst protocol score is considered.
SSL 2.0: 0
SSL 3.0: 80
TLS 1.0: 90
TLS 1.1: 95
TLS 1.2: 100
Common name. This refers to the common name ﬁeld
speciﬁed in the CSR which speciﬁes a FQDN (and re-
spective subdomains if applicable) the certiﬁcate is is-
sued for.
Key size. This refers to the size of the server’s key pair.
Certiﬁcate chain length. This refers to the length of
the certiﬁcate chain, including the server’s certiﬁcate and
certiﬁcates of intermediate CAs, and the certiﬁcate of a
root CA trusted by all parties in the chain. Every inter-
mediate CA in the chain holds a certiﬁcate issued by the
CA one level above it in the trust hierarchy. In our exam-
ple, the ideal length is 3.
Used provided CA to sign.
In order to remove the
bias from different CAs with varying usability, we im-
plemented our own CA and provided the link to this CA
in the assignment. Two participants did not use this CA
and generated self-signed certiﬁcates instead.
Encrypted private key indicates whether the server’s
private key was encrypted by the study participant.
SSL 2 – TLS 1.2
supported.
indicates which protocol versions are
RC4 support. To date, RC4 is considered weak and
should therefore not be supported, unless required for
compatibility reasons as found in [10].
Vulnerable to POODLE indicates whether the conﬁg-
uration is vulnerable to POODLE [32].
Forward secrecy indicates whether the conﬁguration
supports ciphers with forward secrecy (e.g., ECDHE).
HSTS indicates whether HTTP Strict Transport Secu-
rity is conﬁgured. The security beneﬁt of HSTS is that
it forces secure communication with websites that use it
by automatically converting all plain text and disabling
click-through certiﬁcate warnings.
If a client does not
support HSTS, it simply ignores the header. Hence, acti-
vating HSTS enhances security with minimal effort with-
out impact on compatibility.
HPKP indicates whether Public Key Pinning is used,
which is a useful feature to prevent attacks and making
the public aware of them.
