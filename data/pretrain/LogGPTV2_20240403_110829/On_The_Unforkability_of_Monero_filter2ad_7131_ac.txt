**Table 1: Summary of Traceable Inputs from Key Reuse and the Cascade Effect**

| Blockchain | Height | Key Reuse (Traceable Input Tx. Count) | Cascade Effect (Traceable Input Tx. Count) |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Monero6    | 1,675,606 | 52,646                                | 3,148                                     |
| Monero7    | 1,675,303 | 53,162                                | 5,680                                     |
| MoneroV    | 1,671,617 | 7,542                                 | 888                                       |

**Dataset:**
- **Input Count:** 44,467
- **Tx. Count:** 810,409

- **Input Count:** 84,053
- **Tx. Count:** 274,131

- **Input Count:** 1,876,341
- **Tx. Count:** 269,335

According to the results, the coefficients are 0.242 and 0.32. Based on this information, we deduce that the market price and the number of traceable inputs are correlated, although causality between the two parameters cannot be determined from the statistical analyses performed.

**Figure 5: Linear Regression Analysis of the Dataset**

- **Monero Classic:**
  - R-squared: 0.180
  - Medium relationship between the number of traceable inputs and the market price.

- **Monero Original:**
  - R-squared: 0.146
  - Medium relationship between the number of traceable inputs and the market price.

- **MoneroV:**
  - R-squared: 0.003
  - Small relationship between the number of traceable inputs and the market price.

### 5.4 Analysis on Key Reuse and Coin Availability

At the time of writing, cryptocurrency portal Coinmarketcap.com lists Monero Classic (XMC) and Monero Original (XMO) as separate coins, although they are in the same blockchain branch. These cryptocurrencies are traded in different markets:

- **Monero Classic (XMC):**
  - Gate.io (XMC/USDT, XMC/BTC)
  - HitBTC (XMC/BTC, XMC/USDT, XMC/ETH)
  - TradeOgre (XMC/BTC)

- **Monero Original (XMO):**
  - HitBTC (XMO/BTC, XMO/USDT, XMO/ETH)

- **MoneroV (XMV):**
  - TradeOgre (XMV/BTC)

On April 4, 2018, two days before the Monero6 fork, the top six most active cryptocurrency exchanges for Monero were HitBTC, Binance, Bitfinex, Poloniex, Kraken, and Livecoin, which collectively made up 84.8% of the total daily Monero trading volume [37]. HitBTC had the largest share at 37.68%, while Livecoin had the smallest at 3.82% [37].

Although the pre-fork trading history for MoneroV on TradeOgre is unavailable, it can be inferred that the majority of cryptocurrency markets did not support MoneroV, resulting in Monero users not receiving MoneroV from the exchanges. In contrast, Monero6 was supported by major exchanges like HitBTC, leading to a larger distribution of Monero6 coins to users.

The market availability likely contributed to the fact that the number of traceable inputs on MoneroV is only 14.3% of those on Monero6. However, it is not possible to determine the exact amount of coins spent in these traceable inputs due to the implementation of RingCT, which obfuscates transaction amounts.

### 5.3 Analysis on Key Reuse and Cryptocurrency Market Price Correlation

We collected historical prices of Monero Classic and Monero Original from Coinmarketcap.com (April 20, 2018, to October 3, 2018), and the prices of MoneroV from Coingecko.com (July 4, 2018, to October 3, 2018). The summary of the market prices is provided in Table 2.

- **Monero Classic and Monero Original:**
  - Average price: US$4
  - Lowest: US$1
  - Highest: US$27

- **MoneroV:**
  - Average price: US$0.06
  - Lowest: US$0.02
  - Highest: US$0.26

If the price of MoneroV is multiplied by ten, it would still only average US$0.6, compared to the seven times higher average price of Monero Classic and Monero Original.

Based on the price information, we studied the correlation between market prices and traceable input count as well as transaction count using Kendall’s tau-b and Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients. The results are presented in Table 3.

Cohen, as cited by Sauro and Lewis [28], provides three interpretations of correlation coefficient r:
- Small: 0.1 ≤ r ≤ 0.3
- Medium: 0.3 ≤ r ≤ 0.5
- Large: r ≥ 0.5

Our results show that all coefficients for both Monero Classic and Monero Original are in the range of 0.557 to 0.754, indicating a strong correlation between the price and key reuse. For MoneroV, a small correlation can be summarized with coefficients of 0.242 and 0.32.

### 6 Mitigation Strategies

#### 6.1 Current Mitigation Strategies

##### 6.1.1 Not Claiming the Coins

There is a suggestion for Monero users not to use the newly created coins they receive for free [29]. The amount of coins received varies depending on the new systems:
- **Monero6:** 1:1 coin distribution
- **MoneroV:** 1:10 coin distribution

This method has two main issues:
1. Users may lose potential profits by not claiming coins.
2. It is only effective if all Monero users do not redeem their new coins. If any user redeems, it can reduce or remove the anonymity of other users' transactions, making them traceable.

##### 6.1.2 Churning

Churning involves sending the user's coins to their own addresses multiple times [13]. This expands the output selection, making it harder for attackers to determine the real outputs. However, churning is still vulnerable to timing and network attacks, and its effectiveness in mitigating key reuse is questionable [29].

##### 6.1.3 Blackball Tool

The Monero developers created a tool called "blackball" to blacklist known bad outputs. The term "blackball" originally refers to a document describing the first identified problem within the Monero system, where an adversary tries to add their own outputs to the blockchain by creating many transactions [24]. These outputs, controlled by the adversary, are called blackballs or black marbles, while genuine users' outputs are white balls or white marbles.

When blackballs are included in a transaction as mixins, the adversary can identify them as decoys, reducing the anonymity of the affected transaction. The blackball application discourages the use of blacklisted outputs but is not mandatory for users to run.
