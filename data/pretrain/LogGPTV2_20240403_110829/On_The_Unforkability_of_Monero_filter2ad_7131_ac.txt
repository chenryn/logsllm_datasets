according to the result, where the coefficients are 0.242 and 0.32.
Based on this information, we deduct that the market price and
the number of traceable inputs are correlated, although the causal-
ity between the two parameters cannot be determined from the
statistical analyses performed.
The linear regression analysis of the dataset is shown in Figure 5.
The R-squared values are 0.180, 0.146, and 0.003 for Monero Classic,
Monero Original, and MoneroV respectively. The result shows a
medium relationship between the number of traceable inputs and
the market price on both Monero Classic and Monero Original, but
a small relationship among the two variables on MoneroV.
5.4 Analysis on Key Reuse and Coin
Availability
At the time of writing, cryptocurrency portal Coinmarketcap.com
lists Monero Classic (XMC) and Monero Original (XMO) as two
separate coins, although in reality these two cryptocurrencies are
in the same blockchain branch. Each of these cryptocurrencies are
being traded in different cryptocurrency markets. Monero Classic6
is traded at:
• Gate.io (XMC/USDT pair and XMC/BTC pair)
• HitBTC (XMC/BTC pair, XMC/USDT pair, and XMC/ETH
• TradeOgre (XMC/BTC pair)
pair)
Monero Original, on the other hand, is only available at HitBTC
(XMO/BTC pair, XMO/ USDT pair, and XMO/ETH pair). The other
Monero fork, MoneroV (XMV), is only available at TradeOgre
(XMV/BTC pair). On 4 April 2018, two days before Monero6 fork,
the top six most busy cryptocurrency exchanges serving Mon-
ero are HitBTC, Binance, Bitfinex, Poloniex, Kraken, and Livecoin,
which made 84.8% of the total daily Monero trading volume [37].
HitBTC has the largest portion of 37.68%, while Livecoin had the
lowest portion of 3.82% among the six exchangers [37]. Although
the Monero pre-fork trading information history in TradeOgre is
unavailable, it can still be deducted that the majority of the cryp-
tocurrency markets did not support MoneroV, therefore the Monero
users never received MoneroV from the cryptocurrency exchanges.
On the other hand, as Monero6 was supported by big exchanges
such as HitBTC, it is assumed that the number of Monero6 coins
distributed to the users were larger than MoneroV coins.
The market availability is likely to be one of the factors that
cause the number of traceable inputs on MoneroV is only 14.3% of
Monero6’s traceable inputs. However, it is not possible to determine
how much coins were spent in the traceable inputs due to the

5.3 Analysis on Key Reuse and Cryptocurrency
Market Price Correlation
We collected historical prices of Monero Classic and Monero Orig-
inal from Coinmarketcap.com (20 April 2018 to 3 October 2018),
while the prices of MoneroV were gathered from Coingecko.com (4
July 2018 to 3 October 2018). We calculated statistical data regarding
the market prices for Monero Classic, Monero Original, and Mon-
eroV. The summary of the market prices can be found on Table 2.
We identified that while the prices of Monero Classic and Monero
Original are in the average of US$4 (lowest at US$1 and highest
at US$27), the average price of MoneroV is extremely low, which
is at US$ 0.06 (lowest at US$0.02 and highest at US$0.26). If the
price of MoneroV is multiplied by ten, then the MoneroV price only
becomes US$0.6 in average, whereas the average price of Monero
Classic and Monero Original is seven times more expensive.
Based on the price information of Monero Classic (price at high,
low, and close), Monero Original (price at high, low, close), and
MoneroV (price at open and close), we studied the correlation be-
tween market prices and traceable input count as well as transaction
count by computing Kendall’s tau-b correlation coefficient and
Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient. The result is presented
in Table 3.
Cohen as cited by Sauro and Lewis [28] provided three inter-
pretations of correlation coefficient r as follows: r is small when
0.1 ≤ r ≤ 0.3, medium when 0.3 ≤ r ≤ 0.5, and large when r ≥ 0.5.
Our results show that all coefficients for both Monero Classic and
Monero Original are in the range of 0.557 and 0.754, which indicates
a strong correlation between the price and key reuse in Monero
Classic and Monero Original. On the other hand, a small correlation
between the price and key reuse in MoneroV can be summarised

implementation of RingCT which obfuscates the amount of coins
involved in the transactions.
We also made several assumptions as follows.
(1) The users will be given free coins after a hard fork, as long
as they hold an amount of coins on the original blockchain
branch before the hard fork [9–11].
(2) The users prefer to get a maximum benefit by selling the
coins at a high price.
(3) If the users are using private wallets (either by using a com-
puter wallet, smartphone wallet, web wallet, or paper wallet),
then the users need to setup new wallet applications for the
new chains and import the information from their old wallet
before they can create transactions.
(4) If the users deposit their coins to cryptocurrency exchanges’
wallets before the hard fork, then it depends on the ex-
changes whether they are supporting the new coins; only
then the users will receive the new coins from the exchanges
which will be credited to their accounts on those exchanges
[9–11].
The assumption 1 and 2 motivate the users to redeem their new
coins, hence, the problem of key reuse potentially occurs. However,
assumption 3 becomes a barrier for the users, as setting up new
wallets by importing private keys from old wallets is not trivial and
requires a technical knowledge. In assumption 4, when the cryp-
tocurrency exchanges do not support the forked coins, then it is not
possible for the users to claim the newly created cryptocurrencies.
6 MITIGATION STRATEGIES
In this section, existing mitigation strategies for the problem of key
reuse are discussed. A new mitigation strategy is also proposed.
6.1 Current Mitigation Strategy
6.1.1 Not claiming the coins. There is a suggestion for Monero
users not to use the newly created coins they received for free [29].
The amount of coins received by the users vary depending on the
new systems. Monero6 provides 1:1 coin distribution. This means
each Monero holder receives the exact amount of coins on the new
blockchain branch. MoneroV offers 1:10 coin distribution, in which
the Monero holders receives ten times the amount of Monero they
have before the fork occurrs.
There are two identified problems in this method. Firstly, the
method is not preferable by the users, since they may lose potential
profits by not claiming coins. The free coins can be traded for other
cryptocurrencies or even local currencies. The suggestion is even
more unlikely to be followed by the users when the amount of
profit they can get by spending the coins is substantial. Secondly,
the method can only be effective if and only if all Monero users do
not redeem their new coins. If any of the Monero users redeem the
new coins, the redeeming transactions can potentially reduce or
even completely remove the anonymity of other users’ transactions
which make their transactions traceable.
6.1.2 Churning. Churning technique expands the output selection
by sending the users’ coin to their own addresses multiple times [13].

Wijaya et al.
By churning the coins, the number of ring members or decoys will
expand, which in turn makes it harder for an attacker to determine
the real outputs being used from multiple transactions created
during the churning process to trace the transactions. However,
churning technique is still prone to known attacks such as timing
attack and network attack which deduct real outputs based on the
origins of the transactions [29]. The effectiveness of churning to
mitigate the key reuse problem is also questionable [29].
6.1.3 Blackball tool. The Monero developers created a tool called
blackball. Blackball is a term originally coming from a docu-
ment that describes the first identified problem within Monero
system, where an adversary tries to add his/her own outputs to the
blockchain by creating as many transactions as possible [24]. The
outputs controlled by the adversary is called blackballs or black
marbles, while other outputs created by genuine users are white
balls or white marbles. Whenever the blackballs are included
in a transaction t as members of the mixins, then the adversary
will be able to determine his/her blackballs as decoys and not the
real outputs being spent. Hence the anonymity level of the affected
transaction t is reduced.
The blackball application created by the Monero developers
tries to blacklist known bad outputs; all outputs in the blacklist are
discouraged to be used by the users as mixins. The application is
not mandatory to be run by the users; the application was released
