ABSTRACT 
With  the  rapid  development  of  technology,  data  is  becoming 
ubiquitous.  User  privacy  and  data  security  are  drawing  much 
attention  over  the  recent  years,  especially  with  the  European 
Union’s  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR)  and  other 
laws  coming  into  force.  On  one  hand,  from  the  customers' 
perspective,  how  to  protect  user  privacy  while  making  use  of 
customers’  data  is  a  challenging  task.  On  the  other  hand,  data 
silos  are  becoming  one  of  the  most  prominent  issues  for  the 
society.  From  the  business’  perspective,  how  to  bridge  these 
isolated data islands to build better AI systems while meeting the 
data  privacy  and  regulatory  compliance  requirements  has 
imposed  great  challenges  to  the  traditional  machine  learning 
paradigm.  PPMLP  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  connect 
researchers  from  both  CCS  community  and  machine  learning 
community to tackle these challenges.

1  INTRODUCTION   
Protecting  data  privacy  from  multiple  data  owners  while 
utilizing  these  data  for  joint  model  creation  and  joint  data 
analysis  has  become  a  more  and  more  practical  problem, given 
that  GDPR  and  other  national  laws  have  come  into  force.

Academic  researchers  from  different  areas  have  proposed 
multiple  ideas  to  attack  the  aforementioned  challenges  from 
different  perspectives.  Researchers  and  engineers  in  industries 
also  implement  various  improvements  on  the  internal  AI 
systems  for  privacy  and  security  enhancement.  However,  we 
need  more  opportunities  to  connect  researchers  from  different 
backgrounds  and  domains  together  to  exchange  the  problem 
formulations  in  practice  and  research  advances  in  different 
principals. CCS is a top-tier conference which relates to all real-
world  aspects  of  computer  security  and  privacy.  Organizing 
PPMLP  in  conjunction  with  CCS  2020  will  provide  a  forum  for 
both  machine 
learning  and  security  researchers/industrial 
practitioners  to  jointly  review  the  recent  academic  progress  on 
PPML  techniques  and  valuable  lessons  learned  from  the  real-
world applications. 
2  TOPICS OF INTEREST
