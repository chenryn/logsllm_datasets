### Network Topologies and Simulation Setup

1. **Internet2 Topology:**
   - Interconnects 9 Internet2 sensors located at major Points of Presence (PoPs).
   - Includes 44 links (all with known IP addresses) and 72 paths.
   - The average path length is approximately 4 hops.

2. **ESNet Topology:**
   - Interconnects 22 ESNet sensors located at major PoPs.
   - Includes 390 links (all with known IP addresses) and 382 paths.
   - The average path length is approximately 6 hops.

3. **PlanetLab Topology:**
   - Derived from full-mesh Paris-traceroute measurements between 100 PlanetLab hosts at different sites.
   - Includes 4,672 links and 5,917 paths.
   - The average path length is about 15 hops.

### Path Cover Sets and Link Grouping

In each topology, some links share the same path cover set (the set of paths traversing that link). When two or more links have the same path cover set, it is impossible to distinguish them and determine which one, if any, is faulty. Therefore, as in previous work [15, 24], we group links with the same path cover set together and localize bad link groups instead of individual links. The size of these groups is a topological property of the underlying network:
- In the PlanetLab topology, the average group size is around 1.8.
- In the ESNet and Internet2 topologies, the average group size is almost 1.0.

### Simulation Parameters

In each simulation run, we select a topology and then choose lossy links either randomly or based on a distribution that favors links close to the edge of the network (about 80% of the lossy links are within three hops of at least one sensor). This approach simulates scenarios where congestion primarily occurs at the periphery rather than the core of the network.

### Evaluation Metrics

We consider the following metrics:
- **Precision:** The ratio of correctly identified lossy links to the total number of inferred lossy links, \( \text{precision} = \frac{|I \cap O|}{|O|} \).
- **Recall:** The ratio of correctly detected lossy links to the actual number of lossy links, \( \text{recall} = \frac{|I \cap O|}{|I|} \).
- **Accuracy:** The ratio of inferred lossy links whose performance range is accurately estimated, \( \text{accuracy} = \frac{|Q|}{|O|} \), where \( Q \) is the set of lossy links whose performance range includes the actual loss rate.

### Setting the α Parameter

We use two methods to set the α parameter:
1. **Method-1:** Relies on prior measurements (e.g., using SNMP data from routers) to calculate the variation of end-to-end loss rates in all paths that traverse a single lossy link. The minimum value of α is chosen such that all these paths are α-similar. In simulations, Method-1 gives α ≈ 0.3 for Bernoulli losses and about 0.5 for Gilbert losses.
2. **Method-2:** Does not require prior knowledge. Links in good paths and those traversed by only a small number of bad paths (say 3) are removed. For each remaining link, the average loss rate \( \bar{r} \) of all paths traversing that link is computed, and the minimum value of α is determined such that the loss rate of every such path is α-similar with \( \bar{r} \). The median of these α values is used. This method assumes that if a link is traversed by multiple bad paths, it is likely a bad link. The likelihood of false positives and paths traversing multiple bad links is low in practice.

### Comparison with Other Algorithms

We compare Sum-Tomo with two other tomography algorithms:
- **Boolean Tomo method [8]:** Aims to find the minimum set of links shared between lossy paths.
- **Analog Norm method [23]:** Solves the path equations heuristically using error minimization, favoring solutions with fewer lossy links.

The precision and recall of Norm are computed by comparing the returned point estimates with a threshold δ. The accuracy of Norm is calculated by converting the reported point estimates to range estimates using the relation shown in line-16 of Algorithm 2.

### Simulation Results

Each simulation is repeated 200 times, and the standard error is negligible (mostly between 0.005 and 0.02). We show the average across all runs.

#### ESNet Topology

- **Figure 2:** Results with three tomography algorithms in ESNet, with the number of lossy links varying from 1 to 20 (up to about 20% of the total links). Lossy links are selected randomly, and the loss process follows the Bernoulli model. The value of α is set based on Method-1.
  - **Figure 2a:** Precision of Tomo and Sum-Tomo is very close.
  - **Figure 2b:** Recall of Sum-Tomo is higher than Tomo by up to 13%.
  - **Figure 2c:** Accuracy comparison between Sum-Tomo and Norm.

- **Figure 3:** Similar results for the Gilbert process.

- **Figure 4:** Comparison of results using Method-2 for setting α.

### Conclusion

As the number of lossy links increases, the performance of all tomography algorithms degrades due to the creation of more lossy paths, making it harder to identify good links. Sum-Tomo generally outperforms Tomo in terms of recall and shows competitive precision and accuracy compared to the Norm method.
