I used material-ui@next as server side render and do all things as the
documents. But my console says
    Warning: Failed child context type: Invalid child context `64a55d578f856d258dc345b094a2a2b3` of type `Jss` supplied to `JssProvider`, expected instance of `Jss`.
        in JssProvider (at server.js:274)
Here are the code around line 274
        const jss = create(preset());
        jss.options.createGenerateClassName = createGenerateClassName;
        const rootComponent = (
                {route.component}
        );
Is there some things wrong? Thanks for help.
