**ATT&CK ID:** C0022  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Operation Dream Job

During Operation Dream Job, the Lazarus Group executed malware using the following command:

```
C:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe "C:\ProgramData\ThumbNail\thumbnail.db", CtrlPanel S-6-81-3811-75432205-060098-6872 0 0 905
```

This command leverages `rundll32.exe` to execute a malicious DLL (disguised as a database file) located at `C:\ProgramData\ThumbNail\thumbnail.db`. The additional parameters, including `CtrlPanel` and the string of numbers, are likely used to control or configure the behavior of the malware. [References: 72, 73, 74]
