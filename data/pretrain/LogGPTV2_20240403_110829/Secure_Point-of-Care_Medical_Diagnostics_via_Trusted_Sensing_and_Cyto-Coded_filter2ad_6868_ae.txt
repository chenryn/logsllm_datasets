beads and actual blood cells with clear margins. Furthermore,
as discussed above, MedSen is able to recover the concen-
tration of different types of beads quite precisely (Figures 12
and 13). Thus, MedSen can utilize both different bead types
and bead concentration levels to generate unique identiﬁers
in the patient blood sample efﬁciently. We noticed that low
bead concentrations have less variance and improved resolution
compared with higher concentrations (see the ﬁgures). This
means that lower bead concentrations allow MedSen to deﬁne
different concentration levels of the same bead types close
to each other. This increases the password space size and
entropy, and hence improves the design’s overall security
against bruteforce intrusions.
VIII. RELATED WORK
Here, we review the most recent related past work that have
been proposed in signal encryption, medical device security,
and microﬂuidic biomarker detection.
General-purpose symmetric encryption [4] would require
to decipher the samples on the server side for analysis and
would reveal the clear dataset. Existing homomorphic encryp-
tion algorithms [13] currently do not provide the calculus
ﬂexibility and performance required to deal with biomarker
sensor measurements. Additionally, conventional cryptography
work on digital data points that would require addition of fairly
complex analog-to-digital circuitry to MedSen’s design.
For analog signal protection, the past work has proposed
signal scrambling techniques [35] that implement a limited set
of transformations using a key. In the medical ﬁeld, INTRAS
proposes a key exchange and data encryption method based on
interpolation and random sampling as an alternative symmet-
ric encryption technique for electrocardiogram physiological
signals [2]. These techniques are implemented in software,
and require powerful processors to encrypt ﬁne-grained analog
signals once original measurements are acquired by the sensor
hardware. MedSen reconﬁgures the sensor hardware such
that the acquired measurements are already encrypted. This
eliminates the need for powerful computational and memory
resources as large trusted computing bases. Hence it brings
down the size, complexity and cost of the device, while
improving the overall security. To the best of our knowledge,

C. Cyto-Coded Passwords and Patient Authentication
Section V described MedSen’s cyto-coded authentication
using synthetic micro-beads mixed with the patient’s blood
sample. Every patient-speciﬁc unique identiﬁer consists of
a particular number (concentrations) of beads from differ-
ent types. In conceptual comparison to traditional password
paradigms, the number of password characters would corre-
spond to the number of bead types involved, and speciﬁc
character value within the password would correspond to the
number (concentration) of beads of a particular type. There-
fore, having larger number of bead types would increase the
cyto-coded password space size and hence the overall security.
The two crucial requirements, however, are i) MedSen’s design
and peak counting analysis can distinguish the peaks caused
by the different types of beads; and ii) MedSen can distinguish
different concentration levels of the same bead type within the
blood samples for different patients. In other words, keeping
concentration levels of two patients too close to each other may
confuse MedSen, possibly lead to false user identiﬁcation.
We evaluated the difference between the measured electri-
cal impedance of 3.58 μm, 7.8 μm synthetic beads and actual
blood cells. Figure 15 shows the results. The normalized
electrical impedance of synthetic beads and blood cells is
evaluated at multiple frequencies. Figure 15a shows at the
frequency of 2 MHz and higher, the blood cell has lower
electrical impedance response comparing to the impedance
response of synthetic beads in Figure 15b and 15c. All those
impedance measurements for different bead types at different
frequencies are considered as features. MedSen uses the fea-
tures for its classiﬁcation procedures to distinguish between
different particles. Figure 16 shows the results. The proposed
solution is able to differentiate different types of synthetic

MedSen is the ﬁrst physical based encryption scheme for
cytometry that do not rely on any software-based analog or
digital signal manipulation.
Flow cytometry has been studied extensively as alternative
methods to impedance cytometry for diagnosing and monitor-
ing diseases such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis [1], [26].
For instance, [1] has shown the high correlation of CD4+T-
lymphocytes counts by ﬂow cytometry and the standard of
Coulter cytosphere assay. White blood cell counts have also
been studied to characterize Plasmodium falciparum-infected
patients, Plasmodium vivax-infected patients, and the unin-
fected patients [26]. However, the technique is expensive and
requires highly trained technicians adhering to the strict proto-
cols. These challenges call for the design and development of
cost-effective disposable testing solutions without sacriﬁcing
the sensitivity [9]. Microﬂuidic protein quantiﬁcation also has
been conducted using a mobile platform [11], [21], [25]. The
protein is aggregated with gold nanoparticles and detected with
LED light . The results from the experiment are stored in text
ﬁle and distributed over the network via Google Drive. How-
ever, for sensitive medical information, such as HIV diagnosis,
the results should be kept secured for patient’s privacy. Our
method now enables for higher diagnostic accuracy through
single-cell and single particle detection, but also for embedding
security at the physical sensor level.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented MedSen, a portable point-of-
care disease diagnostics solutions that ensures low-cost and
accurate outcomes through use of the smartphone computa-
tional resources. MedSen provides in-sensor hardware-based
analog signal encryption along with cyto-coded authentication
services. MedSen’s speciﬁc encryption design enables cloud-
based analysis of encrypted analog signals without disclosing
the users’ privacy and conﬁdential medical information. Our
real-world implementation of MedSen’s bio-sensor circuitry
and software stack proves its accurate and secure diagnostics
capabilities empirically.
