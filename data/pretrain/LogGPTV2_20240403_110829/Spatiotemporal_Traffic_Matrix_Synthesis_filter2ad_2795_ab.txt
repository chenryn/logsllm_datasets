locations, so each snapshot is an N × N matrix.

Temporal properties refer to the statistical properties
only varying with t, either with ﬁxed spatial indices,
i.e., the process Xi,j(tk), or some summary such as the
total traﬃc S(tk) =Pi,j Xi,j(tk) at each time point tk.
3.1 Maximum entropy models
In the introduction we discussed the qualities that
make a good synthesis model. In this section our pri-
mary foci are simplicity and controllability.
Testing does not (necessarily) require realistic input,
since the goal is to understand the eﬀect a speciﬁc in-
put has on an algorithm. For instance, inputs could
be extreme cases, such as a TM with its total traﬃc
spread uniformly over all entries (called a uniform load
model [6,38]). What we do need is the ability to control
the input of an algorithm to perform systematic tests.
Chieﬂy, we need to incorporate what we believe about
the network. Diﬀerent types of networks have diﬀerent
properties and constraints. For instance, data centers
have entirely diﬀerent traﬃc mixes from WANs [1, 16]
so there exists diﬀerent constraints on their respective
TMs. The constraints we primarily consider here are
in the form of constraints on statistics of the TM: for
instance, a constraint on the average or expected value
E[·] of some aspect of the TM. Deterministic constraints
can also be added, but are rather simpler to analyze, so
we focus on the more diﬃcult case.
Though we primarily focus on WANs, the general
methodology provides tools for researchers to develop
synthesis models for alternative networks. Part of the

goal here is to provide a modeling framework for re-
searchers even before a new technology is deployed, to
understand its properties under various hypotheses.
Figure 1 presents an overview of our methodology.
The inputs are the set of constraints, and the spatial and
temporal dimensions N and M respectively. Solving
(3) gives the MaxEnt distribution f (X ), which entails
computing the Lagrange multipliers {λℓ}L
ℓ=1. Gener-
ally, these can be computed using the Newton-Raphson
method (see [43]), but it is more instructive where we
can derive closed forms for the distributions, and so we
spend some eﬀort here to derive a number of such mod-
els in a manner that is explanatory and extensible.
Finally, f (X ) is sampled to generate the synthetic
TM process X . Again, this can be achieved numeri-
cally, say via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tech-
niques, but we demonstrate several models for which
sampling can be performed much more eﬃciently. Con-
straints that often arise in TM research lead to closed
forms, which in turn provide fast sampling methods.
For all models, let R(tk) = X(tk)1N and C(tk) =
X(tk)T1N , i.e., the row and column sum processes (to-
tal ingress and egress traﬃc), and S(tk) denotes the
total traﬃc in each interval tk.
Model derivations involve (sometimes) lengthy, but
standard derivations, and so in the interests of space we
omit the details. However, there are some simple facts
which should make the results somewhat intuitive:
1. Given the constraints of non-negativity and mean,
the MaxEnt distribution is the exponential [27].
5822. With both a mean and variance constraint, the Max-
Ent distribution is the Normal distribution, and if we
add to this the requirement of non-negativity, then
the MaxEnt distribution is the truncated normal dis-
tribution [39].
3. Many other distributions arise from other moment-
based or otherwise constraints on the RVs [27].
4. If we have two (or more) RVs, the MaxEnt model is
that the RVs are independent (unless there is a joint
constraint on the RVs) [10].
3.2 Purely spatial models
We divide our models into three classes: purely spa-
tial, purely temporal, and spatiotemporal models. First
generation TM models such as the gravity model [45]
and the discrete choices model [22] are spatial, so we
start there, noting that if we have no temporal informa-
tion, the TM snapshots will be independent (Property
4), so we need only focus on a single interval and thus
we drop tk from our notation.
Independent entries model: In the absence of con-
straints on the joint distribution of TM entries Xi,j,
by Property 4, these will be independent.
If we also
have homogenous constraints, i.e., they don’t favor any
group of entries, then the entries will be IID.
There are many subcases of this type. For instance
if the mean or expected value of each entry is ﬁxed,
i.e., E[Xi,j] = ¯X, then the MaxEnt model has entries
Xi,j ∼ Exp(cid:0) ¯X −1(cid:1). If we further impose control on each
MaxEnt model has entries Xi,j ∼ TNorm(cid:0) ¯X, σ2(cid:1).
entry’s variance by setting the variance to σ2 then the
If
instead we only set bounds [DL, DU ] on each TM entry,
the MaxEnt model has IID entries Xi,j ∼ U(DL, DU ).
These models are perhaps oversimpliﬁed, but they
have been used! For instance, the Poisson model of
Vardi [42] and the log-normal model of Nucci et al. [24].
In the latter case we can derive an interesting insight.
The log-normal distribution is the result of constraints
on the average and variance of the log of entries [27].
The natural conclusion is that TM entries might be bet-
ter modeled in the log-domain.
However, the key takeaway message is not the log-
normal distribution, but rather that MaxEnt leads to a
link between the model and its hidden assumptions, and
these can provide potential insights into the data and/or
the validity of the model. Perhaps another model pro-
vides a slightly less tight ﬁt to the data, but is simpler
and more intuitive when considered in this way, and
therefore has more explanatory power?
Outer product models: IID models are clearly lim-
ited. Real TMs have correlations. Two attempts to
build such correlations are the Random Gravity Model
(RGM) [31] and the mapping phase of [24].
Let us consider here a simple yet powerful method
of creating structure, which is to impose constraints on
the row and column sums of the matrix, an idea that
recurs through much of the TM literature1 (e.g., [14,
22, 31, 35, 45, 46]), and even into the realms of oblivious
design where TMs are assumed to be unknowable [49]
except for these constraints.
If we impose row and column constraints (only), then
the MaxEnt model is formed via an outer product: for
instance given non-negativity and the constraints
E[R ] =
T
N
1N , E[C ] =
T
N
1N , E[S] = T,
the MaxEnt model is given by the outer product
X =

N 2
U V T,
(6)
where Ui, Vj ∼ Exp (1). This case is in fact the RGM
of [31], and that illustrates how we can ﬁnd new infor-
mation about minimal assumptions of a model. The
RGM was derived from data, but now we can under-
stand the hidden assumptions of the model.
More generally, given constraints E[R ] = r and E[C ] =
c, MaxEnt implies a model that has outer-product form
E[X ] =
1
T
rcT ,
(7)
and from this and the simple distributional arguments
above we can derive a set of rank-1 matrix models.
Much more can be said about outer-product mod-
els. There are many generalizations, many appearing in
older works in the transportation literature, for instance
MaxEnt models that include a distance friction term
that reduces traﬃc between distant locations. Such
terms have not had a clear justiﬁcation in most Inter-
net studies, but can be included via a distance-cost con-
straint within the framework if needed [28].
One point, however, which we must make again is
that this type of approach applies to any matrix for
which we know row and column properties, and we will
reuse this idea in a moment.
3.3 Purely temporal models
An example of a purely temporal traﬃc model is that
proposed in [33], which focused on the long-term trends
and cyclical patterns in traﬃc. There are countless
other examples of such models, applied either to sin-
gle TM entries, link traﬃc or traﬃc totals. Our goal
here is not to describe the panoply of possible models,
but to present how these models ﬁt within the MaxEnt
framework.
In the past, temporal models have chieﬂy been used
for traﬃc prediction2. Predictions generally estimate a
mean, and sometimes a variance around that mean.
1Row and column sums are really the ingress and egress
traﬃc volumes, hence their importance.
2It may appear that applications such as anomaly de-
tection are otherwise, but a closer look shows that most
such techniques revolve around predicting “typical” traf-
ﬁc, and detecting outliers from these predictions.
583As before, if only the mean of a set of (non-negative)
random variables is given, then the RVs will be inde-
pendent and exponentially distributed (Property 1). If
variance is also ﬁxed, then the RVs will be indepen-
dent truncated normals (Property 2). More sophisti-
cated models are also possible, for instance, if the au-
tocovariances are also known [27], but these are rarely
reported in Internet studies so we won’t discuss these
models further except to note that they can be added
to the MaxEnt framework.
Thus, to derive a MaxEnt temporal model we might
choose a mean and variance as function of time and
then simulate from the truncated normal distribution.
The choice of mean and variance varies with the desired
network properties. Commonly, they would not be con-
stants but may include diurnal and weekly cycles.
It should be obvious that the above provides almost
too much ﬂexibility. We can accommodate almost any
temporal model, so the question is how should it be re-
stricted to a reasonable set of models in practice. A very
simple case could arise from modeling cyclical behavior
using Fourier analysis, which is designed speciﬁcally for
that purpose. In this case we do so by choosing con-
straints on the Fourier coeﬃcients of the traﬃc:
F(cid:16)(cid:8)E[S(tk) − T ](cid:9)M −1
k=0 (cid:17) = a.
(8)
The coeﬃcients a would be chosen to reﬂect the cycli-
cal nature of the traﬃc. Then the MaxEnt model is an
exponential model where the means at each time step
are given by E[S(tk)] = ¯s(tk) = T +w(tk), {w(tk)}M −1
k=0 =
F −1(a) and F −1 denotes the inverse discrete Fourier
transform. Notice that now the model generates values
that are only conditionally independent, not IID.
As in other cases, we could also control variances and
then would arrive at a truncated normal model.
Once again, note that the goal of this paper is to
show how knowledge can be exploited to construct a
temporal model, not to suggest that the above is the
only sensible approach. This approach, however, does
have the advantage that both Fourier transforms and
expectation are linear operators.
3.4 Spatiotemporal models
Now that we have both spatial and temporal mod-
els, we can combine ideas in those models to form spa-
tiotemporal models as follows.
Time modulated traﬃc: In most situations, we per-
haps know or can assume information about the spa-
tial and/or the temporal behavior. Many studies have
examined details of these two facets of network traf-
ﬁc [19, 20]. Many more will no doubt follow, but also
remember that we wish to consider potential hypotheti-
cal future traﬃc sources, e.g., traﬃc in hosting centers.
It is often possible to reason about the temporal and
spatial properties of such hypothetical cases.
Importantly though, we rarely have information cor-
relating spatial to temporal behavior (though we will
note an important exception resulting from timezones
in the following model).
We proceed in this case using a common trick in TM
modeling (e.g., see [44, 48]). We stack the columns of
a single TM snapshot and then construct a new matrix
from the columns at each time interval, that is,
X∗,1(t0) X∗,1(t1)
X∗,2(t0) X∗,2(t1)
...
...
X∗,N (t0) X∗,N (t1)
Y =
· · · X∗,1(tM −1)
· · · X∗,2(tM −1)
. . .
· · · X∗,N (tM −1)
...
(9)
The new matrix Y is also sometimes called the traﬃc
matrix, but now it is a N 2 × M spatiotemporal matrix.
We are then in the same situation as in generating
spatial models: we want to generate a matrix about
which we only have row and column constraints. A nat-
ural building block towards more complex spatiotem-
poral models is to consider a model with separate in-
dependent spatial and temporal components. Not sur-
prisingly, this has been studied by statisticians, and is
called a separable spatiotemporal model [11].
In our context, for instance, column-sum constraints
correspond to a model for the total traﬃc S(tk) at each
time tk, and row-sum constraints correspond to con-
straints on the average traﬃc per source/destination
¯Xi,j. The logical construction then is to use the same
outer-product MaxEnt suggested for spatial models, i.e.,
E[Xi,j(tk)] = ¯Xi,j ¯s(tk)/T,
(10)
where T is the time average of ¯s(·). When seen as a
matrix operation, this is just an outer-product of the
stacked vector version of ¯Xi,j and ¯s(tk).
The MaxEnt model then takes the form Xi,j(tk) =
Gi,jP (tk), with E[Gi,j] = ¯Xi,j and E[P (tk)] = ¯s(tk)/T ,
i.e., separate spatial and temporal components. The ex-
act form of Xi,j(tk) depends on the constraints, again
with a constraint on means resulting in an exponen-
tial distribution, and constraints on mean and variance
resulting in a truncated normal. The decomposable na-
ture of the MaxEnt model allows mixing the two, using
one for space and the other for time.
We can also include detailed spatial structure. For
instance, we could have a model we refer to as the Mod-
ulated Gravity Model (MGM) where spatially we con-
strain the traﬃc by gravity-model-like constraints

¯ri(cid:19), Vj ∼ Exp(cid:18) T
¯cj(cid:19), P (tk) ∼ Exp(cid:18) T
¯s(tk)(cid:19),
584where as before ¯s(tk) := T + w(tk). Once again, if
we aim to control the variances, the relevant compo-
nents Ui, Vj and/or P (·) would follow appropriate trun-
cated normal distributions. The simplest choice is to set
Σr = Σc = σ2IN . Likewise, we can also control P (·)
by introducing a single variance parameter σp.
Note that these choices result in simple models, with
minimal parameters, and meaningful parameters that
can be directly related to network properties.
The model’s name comes from the fact that its con-
ditional mean is the RGM modulated by ¯s(tk)/T , i.e.,
E[X(tk)] =
¯r¯cT
