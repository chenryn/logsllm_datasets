Recommendation (2003/361/EC) [42]. This deﬁnition is stan-
dard across statistics related to European and German SMEs,
which allows comparison between our results and those of
similar studies. Since we focus on recommendations for
tech departments of companies outside of the technology sec-

3,484), as well as employees in management board positions
(23.4%; 1,171). Additionally, we interviewed representatives
responsible for company audits (2.1%; 104), data protection
(6.8%; 342) and factory safety (1.1%; 56) as well as rep-
resentatives that did not ﬁt in one of the above categories
(8.0%; 402). With increasing company size, our interview
was more likely to be with dedicated information technology
staff. In smaller companies, we mostly interviewed executive
management.
The average company age was 56 years (median = 39); the
majority (83.8%; 4,192) is older than ten years (SQ: A.4.1).
In our sample, older companies tended to employ more peo-
ple. Approximately half (58.9%) of the interviewees reported
that their company had only one business location in Ger-
many (SQ: A.4.4). About 40% of the companies exported
products or services. Companies with fewer employees were
less likely to export (SQ: A.4.3). About 85.2% (4,262) of
the participants stated that their company employed dedicated
information technology (IT) staff (SQ: A.4.5), and 82.3% of
companies had purchased IT services from external providers
(SQ: A.4.6). Hence, 3,511 (70.2%) run both their own IT
department and purchase external IT services. The majority
(73.6%; 3,682) of companies has dedicated information secu-
rity staff, while 37.4% (1,872) relied on external information
security service providers. 24.4%(1,220) exclusively rely on
external information security services. Table 2 provides an
overview of all demographic information we collected. For
most demographic questions we allowed multiple answers (cf.

4.2 Sensitivity and Risk Perceptions
We asked interviewees questions about information security
sensitivity in their companies, and distinguished between man-
agement and regular employees. Additionally, we collected
risk assessment for their company becoming a victim of a
cyberattack with a distinction between targeted and mass at-
tacks.
Information Security Sensitivity. To assess information
security sensitivity, we asked interviewees three ques-
tions (SQ: A.3.2): We focused on the awareness of informa-
tion security risks of (i) the management board and (ii) regular
