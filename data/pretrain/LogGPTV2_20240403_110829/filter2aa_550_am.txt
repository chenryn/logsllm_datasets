mandate was almost immediately contradicted by a U.S. Department of Commerce 
report advising that premature transition to IPv6 could lead to higher overall transi-
tion costs and even reduced security.
More recently, the first U.S. Chief Information Officer (CIO), Vivek Kundra, provided 
a more detailed government directive – public Internet services such as webmail 
and DNS must operationalize “native” or IPv6-only traffic by October 2012. Internal 
networks must do the same by 2014.309
Most American businesses feel no direct pressure to migrate to IPv6. The reason is 
that the U.S. is the original home of the Internet, so most American firms possess 
enough IP addresses to satisfy their needs. However, the largest software compa-
nies, such as Microsoft, support IPv6 because it should reduce or even eliminate the 
costs associated with NAT, which can be significant for online gaming, instant mes-
saging, file sharing, etc.310 Indeed, Microsoft made IPv6 the default Internet protocol 
for its Vista operating system, which was released in January 2007.

Next Generation Internet: Is IPv6 the Answer?
China has made the most determined effort of any nation to transition to IPv6. 
Above all, the size of China’s population demands a huge increase in its number of 
IP addresses since China has only one IPv4 address for every four of its citizens. 
At the same time, China has held the world’s biggest single IPv6 demonstration to 
date. During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, everything from live television 
and data feeds to security and traffic control was streamed over one vast IPv6 net-
work.311 The cutting edge nature of IPv6 gives China a good way to development its 
Intellectual Property (IP) base. The China Next Generation Internet (CNGI) and the 
China Education and Research Network (CERNET) are huge IPv6 projects that will 
influence the evolution of the Internet for years to come. However, the slow pace of 
popular IPv6 application development, which has helped to keep worldwide transi-
tion sluggish, has disappointed Chinese Internet officials.312
Within the European Union (EU), an IPv6 Task Force has stated that the importance 
of the next-generation Internet “cannot be overestimated.” In 2008, the European 
Commission advised private companies and the public sector to make the switch 
by 2010 and committed €90 million to IPv6 research.313 But near the end of 2009, 
a survey found that less than 20% had done so and that a majority of respondents 
feared its immediate financial costs.314 On the bright side, numerous European com-
panies have made commercial contributions to IPv6 development. Ericsson built the 
world’s first IPv6 router in 1995, and an IPv6 concept car was jointly developed by 
Cisco and Renault. Nonetheless, European companies have complained that further 
incentives from Brussels are needed to ensure a smooth transition.315
In Japan, the need for increased address space is similar to China’s, but the reason 
is not population size. It stems from the desire to connect billions of electronic gad-
gets to the Internet. The Japanese government has assured its country a leadership 
role in IPv6 deployment by offering tax breaks to companies that switch to IPv6. Its 
importance is emphasized in political speeches at the highest level of government316 
and by initiatives such as “eJapan 2005,” in which IPv6 was given prominent sta-
tus. NTT, the largest telecommunications provider in Japan, has offered commercial 
IPv6 services since 2001, and the University of Tokyo has held both the IPv4 and 
IPv6 “World Speed” records simultaneously. As in China, however, both the public

and private sectors are still waiting for more IPv6 applications, even while they are 
attempting to future-proof their infrastructure.317
Differences of Opinion Remain
While there are obvious business opportunities in IPv6, governments are also keen-
ly interested in the strategic cyber security ramifications of the next-generation 
Internet. The loss of NAT will lower the cost of Internet connectivity and provide 
the foundation for improved communications worldwide, but it may also allow gov-
ernments to monitor their Internet space – at least via traffic analysis – with much 
greater ease.
As an international project, IPv6 will both benefit and suffer from significant differ-
ences of approach and opinion. In Asia, citizens are more comfortable with govern-
ment oversight than in the West. In Europe, Internet users are highly motivated to 
protect online anonymity. However, the U.S. is somewhere in the middle – personal 
information is jealously guarded, but the public is sympathetic to the needs of law 
enforcement.
In order to make the IPv6 era fairer than with IPv4, the Internet Assigned Numbers 
Authority (IANA) has published these guidelines:
• every address should be unique;
• every address should be in an accessible registry database;
• distribution should be aggregated, efficient, and hierarchical;
• there should be no “stockpiling” of unused addresses; and
• all potential members of the Internet community should have equal access.
Another factor is the “IPv6 Ready Logo,” which is awarded to software and hardware 
that meets internationally-recognized technical standards. However, this initiative 
has already revealed the politically charged atmosphere surrounding IPv6. For ex-
ample, China successfully argued against the direct inclusion of IPSec in the Logo 
award criteria, a seemingly small victory that could have enormous implications for 
privacy, anonymity, and security on the web for years to come. It remains an open 
question whether the U.S. and the EU should have pushed China harder during these 
negotiations. However, like China they must worry that IPsec will make life too hard 
for law enforcement.318

Sun Tzu: Can Our Best Military Doctrine Encompass Cyber War?
6. SUN TZU: CAN OUR BEST MILITARY DOCTRINE 
ENCOMPASS CYBER WAR?
Cyberspace is a new warfare domain. Computers and the information they contain 
are prizes to be won during any military conflict. But the intangible nature of cy-
berspace can make victory, defeat, and battle damage difficult to calculate. Military 
leaders today are looking for a way to understand and manage this new threat to 
national security. The most influential military treatise in history is Sun Tzu’s Art of 
War. Its recommendations are flexible and have been adapted to new circumstances 
for over 2,500 years. This chapter examines whether Art of War is flexible enough 
to encompass cyber warfare. It concludes that Sun Tzu provides a useful but far from 
perfect framework for the management of cyber war and urges modern military 
strategists to consider the distinctive aspects of the cyber battlefield.
What is Cyber Warfare?
The Internet, in a technical sense, is merely a large collection of networked comput-
ers. Humans, however, have grown dependent on “cyberspace” – the flow of infor-
mation and ideas that they receive from the Internet on a continual basis and im-
mediately incorporate into their lives. As our dependence upon the Internet grows, 
what hackers think of as their potential “attack surface” expands. The governance of 
national security and international conflict is no different: political and military ad-
versaries now routinely use and abuse computers in support of strategic and tactical 
objectives. In the early 1980s, Soviet thinkers referred to this as the Military Tech-
nological Revolution (MTR); following the 1991 Gulf War, the Pentagon’s Revolution 
in Military Affairs (RMA) was practically a household term.319
Cyber attacks first and foremost exploit the power and reach of the Internet. For 
example, since the earliest days of the Web, Chechen rebels have demonstrated the 
power of Internet-enabled propaganda.320 Second, cyber attacks exploit the Inter-
net’s vulnerability. In 2007, Syrian air defense was reportedly disabled by a cyber 
attack moments before the Israeli Air Force demolished an alleged Syrian nuclear re-
actor.321 Third, cyber attackers benefit from a degree of anonymity. During the 1999 
war over Kosovo, unknown hackers tried to disrupt NATO military operations and 
were able to claim minor victories.322 Fourth, even a nation-state can be targeted. In 
2009, the whole of Kyrgyzstan was knocked offline during a time of domestic politi-

cal crisis.323 This list could be lengthened to include cyber warfare’s high return on 
investment, an attacker’s plausible deniability, the immaturity of cyber defense as 
a discipline, the increased importance of non-state actors in the Internet era, and 
more.
Cyber attacks are best understood as an extraordinary means to a wide variety of 
ends: espionage, financial damage, and even the manipulation of national critical 
infrastructures. They can influence the course of conflict between governments, 
between citizens, and between government and civil society.
What is Art of War?
Modern military doctrine draws from a deep well of philosophy that spans political, 
economic, and scientific revolutions. The oldest and most profound treatise is Sun 
Tzu’s Military Strategy, known as Art of War (孙子兵法). Much of our current un-
derstanding of military concepts such as grand strategy, center of gravity, decisive 
point, and commander’s intent can be traced to this book.324
According to Chinese tradition, Art of War was written by Sun Wu (now Tzu) in the 
6th century B.C. and is one of China’s Seven Military Classics. Some scholars argue 
that gaps in logic and anachronisms in the text point to multiple authors, and they 
further contend that Art of War is a compilation of different texts that were brought 
together over time. Nonetheless, the book has an internal consistency that implies 
it is the product of one school of military thought. Art of War was translated for the 
West by a French missionary in 1782 and may have had an influence on the battle-
field victories of Napoleon, who was likely familiar with its contents.325
Art of War has survived for 2,500 years because its advice is not only compelling, 
but concise, easy to understand, and flexible. Sun Tzu does not give military leaders 
a concrete plan of action, but a series of recommendations that can be adapted to 
new circumstances. Sun Tzu’s concepts have been successfully applied to disciplines 
other than warfare, including sports, social relationships, and business.326
There are thirteen chapters in Art of War, each dedicated to a particular facet of 
warfare. This chapter highlights at least one topical passage from each chapter and 
will argue that Sun Tzu provides a workable but not a perfect framework for the 
management of cyber war.

Strategic Thinking
Art of War opens with a warning:
The Art of War is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road 
either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be 
neglected. AoW: I. Laying Plans327
At the strategic level, a leader must take the steps necessary to prevent political 
coercion by a foreign power and to prevent a surprise military attack.328 Regard-
ing offensive military operations, Art of War states that they are justified only in 
response to a direct threat to the nation; economic considerations, for example, are 
insufficient.329
Cyberspace is such a new arena of conflict that basic defense and attack strategies 
are still unclear. There have been no major wars (yet) between modern, cyber-capa-
ble adversaries. Further, cyber warfare tactics are highly technical by nature, often 
accessible only to subject matter experts. As with terrorism, hackers have found 
success in pure media hype. As with Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), it is 
challenging to retaliate against an asymmetric threat. Attack attribution is the most 
vexing question of all – if the attacker can remain anonymous, defense strategies ap-
pear doomed from the start. Finally, the sensitive nature of cyber warfare capabili-
ties and methods has inhibited international discussion on the subject and greatly 
increased the amount of guesswork required by national security planners.
The grace period for uncertainty may be running out. Modern militaries, like the 
governments and economies they protect, are increasingly reliant on IT infrastruc-
ture. In 2010, the United States Air Force procured more unmanned than manned 
aircraft for the first time.330 IT investment on this scale necessarily means an in-
creased mission dependence on IT. As adversaries look for their opponent’s Achilles 
heel, IT systems will be attractive targets. It is likely that the ground fighting of fu-
ture wars will be accompanied by a parallel, mostly invisible battle of wits between 
state-sponsored hackers over the IT infrastructure that is required to wage war at 
all.
Celebrated Red Team exercises, such as the U.S. Department of Defense’s Eligible 
Receiver in 1997, suggest that cyber attacks are potentially powerful weapons. Dur-

ing the exercise, simulated North Korean hackers, using a variety of hacker and 
information warfare tactics including the transmission of fabricated military orders 
and news reports, “managed to infect the human command-and-control system with 
a paralyzing level of mistrust ....  As a result, nobody in the chain of command, from 
the president on down, could believe anything.”331
Because cyber warfare is unconventional and asymmetric warfare, nations weak in 
conventional military power are likely to invest in it as a way to offset conventional 
disadvantages. Good hacker software is easier to obtain than a tank or a rifle. Intel-
ligence officials such as former CIA Director James Woolsey warn that even terrorist 
groups will possess cyber weapons of strategic significance in the next few years.332
Some analysts argue persuasively that the threat from cyber warfare is overstat-
ed.333 However, national security planners cannot afford to underestimate its po-
tential. A general rule could be that, as dependence on IT and the Internet grows, 
governments should make proportional investments in network security, incident 
response, technical training, and international collaboration.
In the near term, international security dialogue must update familiar vocabulary, 
such as attack, defense, deterrence and escalation, to encompass post-IT Revolu-
tion realities. The process that began nearly thirty years ago with MTR and RMA 
continues with the NATO Network Enabled Capability (NNEC), China’s Unrestricted 
Warfare, and the creation of U.S. Cyber Command. However, the word cyber still 
does not appear in NATO’s current Strategic Concept (1999), so there remains much 
work to be done. A major challenge with IT technology is that it changes so quickly 
it is difficult to follow – let alone master – all of the latest developments.
From a historical perspective, it is tempting to think cyber warfare could have a 
positive impact on human conflict. For example, Sun Tzu advised military command-
ers to avoid unnecessary destruction of adversary infrastructure.
In the practical Art of War, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole 
and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture 
an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company 
entire than to destroy them. AoW: III. Attack by Stratagem
If cyber attacks play a lead role in future wars, and the nature of the fight is largely 
over IT infrastructure, it is conceivable that international conflicts will be shorter

and cost fewer lives. A cyber-only victory could facilitate economic recovery and 
post-war diplomacy. Such an achievement would please Sun Tzu, who argued that 
the best leaders can attain victory before combat is even necessary.334
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme 
excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting. AoW: III. At-
tack by Stratagem
But there is no guarantee that the increased use of cyber warfare will lead to less 
human suffering during international conflicts. If national critical infrastructures, 
such as water or electricity, are damaged for any period of time, what caused the 
outage will make little difference to those affected. Military leaders are specifically 
worried that cyber attacks could have unforeseen “cascading” effects that would 
inadvertently lead to civilian casualties, violate the Geneva Convention and bring 
war crimes charges.335 The anonymous nature of cyber attacks also leads to the dis-
turbing possibility of unknown and therefore undeterred hackers targeting critical 
infrastructures during a time of peace for purely terrorist purposes.
Cultivating Success
Due to the remarkable achievements of cyber crime and cyber espionage,336 as well 
as plenty of media hype, cyber warfare will be viewed by military commanders as 
both a threat and an opportunity. But the most eloquent passages from Art of War 
relate to building a solid defense, and this is where a cyber commander must begin.
The Art of War teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s not coming, 
but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but 
rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. AoW: VIII. Variation 
in Tactics
Sun Tzu advises commanders not to rely on the good intentions of others or to 
count on best-case scenarios.337 In cyberspace, this is sound advice; computers are 
attacked from the moment they connect to the Internet.338 Cyber attackers currently 
have numerous advantages over defenders, including worldwide connectivity, vul-
