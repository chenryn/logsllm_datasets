### Contradictory Mandates and Transition to IPv6

The initial mandate for transitioning to IPv6 was almost immediately contradicted by a U.S. Department of Commerce report, which warned that an early transition could result in higher overall costs and potentially reduced security.

More recently, Vivek Kundra, the first U.S. Chief Information Officer (CIO), issued a more detailed directive. This directive stipulated that public Internet services, such as webmail and DNS, must support "native" or IPv6-only traffic by October 2012. Internal networks were required to do the same by 2014.309

### Business Perspective on IPv6 Migration

Most American businesses do not feel immediate pressure to migrate to IPv6. This is because the U.S. is the original home of the Internet, and many American firms already possess sufficient IP addresses to meet their needs. However, major software companies like Microsoft have embraced IPv6, recognizing its potential to reduce or eliminate the costs associated with Network Address Translation (NAT), which can be significant for applications such as online gaming, instant messaging, and file sharing.310 In fact, Microsoft made IPv6 the default Internet protocol for its Vista operating system, released in January 2007.

### China's Efforts in IPv6 Transition

China has made the most determined effort of any nation to transition to IPv6. The sheer size of its population necessitates a substantial increase in IP addresses, as China currently has only one IPv4 address for every four citizens. Additionally, during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China demonstrated the largest IPv6 network to date, streaming live television, data feeds, security, and traffic control over this advanced network.311 The cutting-edge nature of IPv6 provides China with a strategic opportunity to develop its intellectual property (IP) base. Projects like the China Next Generation Internet (CNGI) and the China Education and Research Network (CERNET) are significant IPv6 initiatives that will influence the future of the Internet. However, the slow pace of IPv6 application development has been a source of disappointment for Chinese Internet officials.312

### European Union's IPv6 Initiatives

Within the European Union (EU), the IPv6 Task Force has emphasized the critical importance of the next-generation Internet. In 2008, the European Commission recommended that both private companies and the public sector switch to IPv6 by 2010 and committed €90 million to IPv6 research.313 However, a survey conducted near the end of 2009 found that less than 20% had done so, with many respondents citing concerns about immediate financial costs.314 On a positive note, several European companies have made significant contributions to IPv6 development. For example, Ericsson built the world's first IPv6 router in 1995, and Cisco and Renault jointly developed an IPv6 concept car. Despite these efforts, European companies have called for additional incentives from Brussels to ensure a smoother transition.315

### Japan's IPv6 Deployment

In Japan, the need for increased address space is driven by the desire to connect billions of electronic devices to the Internet, rather than by population size. The Japanese government has taken a proactive role in promoting IPv6, offering tax breaks to companies that make the switch. This commitment is reflected in high-level political speeches and initiatives like "eJapan 2005," where IPv6 was given prominent status. NTT, Japan's largest telecommunications provider, has offered commercial IPv6 services since 2001, and the University of Tokyo holds both the IPv4 and IPv6 "World Speed" records simultaneously. Similar to China, both the public and private sectors in Japan are still waiting for more IPv6 applications while working to future-proof their infrastructure.316

### Strategic Cyber Security Implications

While there are clear business opportunities in IPv6, governments are also deeply interested in the strategic cyber security implications of the next-generation Internet. The loss of NAT will lower the cost of Internet connectivity and improve global communications, but it may also facilitate easier government monitoring of Internet traffic through traffic analysis.

As an international project, IPv6 will benefit and suffer from differing approaches and opinions. In Asia, citizens are generally more comfortable with government oversight compared to the West, where Internet users prioritize online anonymity. The U.S. falls somewhere in between, with a strong emphasis on personal information privacy but also a recognition of the needs of law enforcement.

### IANA Guidelines for IPv6

To ensure a fairer distribution of IPv6 addresses, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has published the following guidelines:
- Every address should be unique.
- Every address should be in an accessible registry database.
- Distribution should be aggregated, efficient, and hierarchical.
- There should be no "stockpiling" of unused addresses.
- All potential members of the Internet community should have equal access.

### IPv6 Ready Logo and Political Considerations

Another factor is the "IPv6 Ready Logo," awarded to software and hardware that meet internationally recognized technical standards. This initiative has highlighted the politically charged atmosphere surrounding IPv6. For instance, China successfully argued against the direct inclusion of IPSec in the Logo award criteria, a decision that could have significant implications for privacy, anonymity, and security on the web. It remains an open question whether the U.S. and the EU should have pushed harder during these negotiations. Like China, they must balance the benefits of IPSec with the challenges it poses for law enforcement.318

### Sun Tzu: Can Our Best Military Doctrine Encompass Cyber War?

#### Introduction

Cyberspace is a new domain of warfare. Computers and the information they contain are valuable assets in military conflicts. However, the intangible nature of cyberspace makes victory, defeat, and battle damage difficult to quantify. Military leaders today seek a way to understand and manage this new threat to national security. One of the most influential military treatises in history is Sun Tzu’s *Art of War*. This chapter examines whether *Art of War* can provide a framework for managing cyber warfare and concludes that while it offers useful insights, it is not a perfect fit for the unique challenges of the cyber battlefield.

#### What is Cyber Warfare?

The Internet, in a technical sense, is a large collection of networked computers. However, humans have become dependent on "cyberspace," the continuous flow of information and ideas from the Internet. As our reliance on the Internet grows, the "attack surface" for hackers expands. National security and international conflict are no different; political and military adversaries now use and abuse computers to achieve strategic and tactical objectives. In the early 1980s, Soviet thinkers referred to this as the Military Technological Revolution (MTR), and after the 1991 Gulf War, the Pentagon’s Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) became a household term.319

Cyber attacks exploit the power and reach of the Internet. For example, Chechen rebels have used the Internet for propaganda since its early days.320 Additionally, cyber attacks exploit the Internet's vulnerabilities. In 2007, Syrian air defense systems were reportedly disabled by a cyber attack just before the Israeli Air Force destroyed an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor.321 Furthermore, cyber attackers benefit from a degree of anonymity. During the 1999 Kosovo war, unknown hackers tried to disrupt NATO military operations and claimed minor victories.322 Even nation-states can be targeted. In 2009, Kyrgyzstan was knocked offline during a domestic political crisis.323

Cyber attacks can serve various ends, including espionage, financial damage, and manipulation of national critical infrastructures. They can influence conflicts between governments, citizens, and civil society.

#### What is Art of War?

Modern military doctrine draws from a deep well of philosophy, spanning political, economic, and scientific revolutions. The oldest and most profound treatise is Sun Tzu’s *Art of War* (孙子兵法). Many of our current military concepts, such as grand strategy, center of gravity, decisive point, and commander’s intent, can be traced to this book.324

According to Chinese tradition, *Art of War* was written by Sun Wu (now Tzu) in the 6th century B.C. and is one of China’s Seven Military Classics. Some scholars argue that the text has gaps in logic and anachronisms, suggesting multiple authors. However, the book's internal consistency implies it is the product of a single school of military thought. *Art of War* was translated into Western languages by a French missionary in 1782 and may have influenced Napoleon’s battlefield victories.325

*Art of War* has endured for 2,500 years because its advice is compelling, concise, easy to understand, and flexible. Sun Tzu does not provide a concrete plan of action but offers recommendations that can be adapted to new circumstances. His concepts have been applied to fields beyond warfare, including sports, social relationships, and business.326

There are thirteen chapters in *Art of War*, each dedicated to a particular aspect of warfare. This chapter highlights at least one topical passage from each chapter and argues that Sun Tzu provides a workable but not perfect framework for managing cyber war.

#### Strategic Thinking

*Art of War* opens with a warning:

"The Art of War is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected. AoW: I. Laying Plans"327

At the strategic level, a leader must take steps to prevent political coercion by a foreign power and to avoid a surprise military attack. Regarding offensive military operations, *Art of War* states that they are justified only in response to a direct threat to the nation; economic considerations are insufficient.328

Cyberspace is a new arena of conflict, and basic defense and attack strategies are still unclear. No major wars have yet occurred between modern, cyber-capable adversaries. Cyber warfare tactics are highly technical, often accessible only to subject matter experts. Hackers have found success through media hype, similar to terrorism. As with Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), retaliating against an asymmetric threat is challenging. Attack attribution is the most vexing question; if the attacker can remain anonymous, defense strategies appear doomed from the start. The sensitive nature of cyber warfare capabilities and methods has inhibited international discussion and increased the guesswork required by national security planners.

The grace period for uncertainty may be running out. Modern militaries, like the governments and economies they protect, are increasingly reliant on IT infrastructure. In 2010, the United States Air Force procured more unmanned than manned aircraft for the first time.330 Such IT investment means increased mission dependence on IT. Adversaries will target IT systems as they look for their opponent’s Achilles heel. Future ground fighting will likely be accompanied by a parallel, mostly invisible battle of wits between state-sponsored hackers over the IT infrastructure required for waging war.

Red Team exercises, such as the U.S. Department of Defense’s Eligible Receiver in 1997, suggest that cyber attacks are powerful weapons. During the exercise, simulated North Korean hackers used various tactics, including the transmission of fabricated military orders and news reports, to "infect the human command-and-control system with a paralyzing level of mistrust."331

Because cyber warfare is unconventional and asymmetric, nations weak in conventional military power are likely to invest in it to offset disadvantages. Good hacker software is easier to obtain than a tank or a rifle. Intelligence officials, such as former CIA Director James Woolsey, warn that even terrorist groups will possess cyber weapons of strategic significance in the next few years.332

Some analysts argue that the threat from cyber warfare is overstated.333 However, national security planners cannot afford to underestimate its potential. A general rule could be that, as dependence on IT and the Internet grows, governments should make proportional investments in network security, incident response, technical training, and international collaboration.

In the near term, international security dialogue must update familiar vocabulary, such as attack, defense, deterrence, and escalation, to encompass post-IT Revolution realities. The process that began nearly thirty years ago with MTR and RMA continues with the NATO Network Enabled Capability (NNEC), China’s Unrestricted Warfare, and the creation of U.S. Cyber Command. However, the word "cyber" still does not appear in NATO’s current Strategic Concept (1999), indicating much work remains. A major challenge with IT technology is that it changes so quickly, making it difficult to follow, let alone master, all the latest developments.

From a historical perspective, it is tempting to think that cyber warfare could have a positive impact on human conflict. For example, Sun Tzu advised military commanders to avoid unnecessary destruction of adversary infrastructure:

"In the practical Art of War, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them. AoW: III. Attack by Stratagem"

If cyber attacks play a lead role in future wars and the fight is largely over IT infrastructure, it is conceivable that international conflicts will be shorter and cost fewer lives. A cyber-only victory could facilitate economic recovery and post-war diplomacy. Such an achievement would please Sun Tzu, who argued that the best leaders can attain victory before combat is necessary.

"Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting. AoW: III. Attack by Stratagem"

However, there is no guarantee that increased use of cyber warfare will lead to less human suffering. If national critical infrastructures, such as water or electricity, are damaged, the cause of the outage will make little difference to those affected. Military leaders are specifically worried that cyber attacks could have unforeseen "cascading" effects, leading to civilian casualties, violating the Geneva Convention, and bringing war crimes charges.335 The anonymous nature of cyber attacks also raises the possibility of unknown and undeterred hackers targeting critical infrastructures during peacetime for purely terrorist purposes.

#### Cultivating Success

Due to the remarkable achievements of cyber crime and cyber espionage,336 as well as media hype, cyber warfare will be viewed by military commanders as both a threat and an opportunity. The most eloquent passages from *Art of War* relate to building a solid defense, and this is where a cyber commander must begin.

"The Art of War teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. AoW: VIII. Variation in Tactics"

Sun Tzu advises commanders not to rely on the good intentions of others or to count on best-case scenarios.337 In cyberspace, this is sound advice; computers are attacked from the moment they connect to the Internet.338 Cyber attackers currently have numerous advantages over defenders, including worldwide connectivity and vulnerabilities in existing systems.
