    function f(a, b)
        for i = 1:1000000
            size(a) == size(b)
        end
    end
    julia> @time f([1], [1])
    elapsed time: 0.096288154 seconds (48000208 bytes allocated, 47.00% gc time)
This does not affect tuples in general:
    function f(a, b)
        for i = 1:1000000
            a == b
        end
    end
    julia> @time f((1,), (1,))
    elapsed time: 0.002870282 seconds (128 bytes allocated)
This hurts `==` for arrays, which checks equality of sizes before proceeding,
as well as in-place functions that need to check that the output is the same
size as the input.
