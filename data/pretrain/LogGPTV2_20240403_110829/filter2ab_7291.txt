### Title: The Last Line of Defense: Understanding and Attacking the Apple File System on iOS

**Abstract:**

Apple's iOS has continuously evolved, incorporating numerous security mechanisms to protect against potential threats and risks. Among these, the filesystem serves as a critical line of defense, safeguarding user data from theft and tampering, and preventing the installation of backdoors or malicious applications.

In pursuit of both enhanced security and improved performance, Apple introduced the Apple File System (APFS) for iOS and macOS. On iOS, APFS is designed to meet the stringent security requirements of the operating system, implementing various protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and modification of critical files and directories, even by attackers with kernel-level privileges. However, our research has uncovered vulnerabilities in these mechanisms, allowing us to exploit or bypass them.

In this presentation, we will begin by providing an overview of the filesystem architecture on Apple systems, followed by a detailed examination of the basic structure of APFS. We will then discuss previous attacks on APFS and explain the new mitigation measures implemented by Apple. Most importantly, we will present a novel attack that successfully bypasses APFS's current mitigations, enabling an attacker to modify any file or directory on the system.

The insights into APFS's architecture, its weaknesses, and our newly discovered attack are essential for iOS hackers and jailbreakers. This information has not been comprehensively covered in any previous talks. We believe that our findings will inspire the development of more secure filesystems for Apple devices.

**Key Points:**
1. **Introduction to Filesystem Architecture:**
   - Overview of the filesystem on Apple systems.
   - Basic structure of APFS.

2. **Previous Attacks and Mitigations:**
   - Analysis of past attacks on APFS.
   - Explanation of APFS's new mitigation techniques through experimental results.

3. **New Attack Methodology:**
   - Detailed presentation of a new attack that bypasses APFS's mitigations.
   - Demonstration of how this attack allows for the tampering of any file or directory on the system.

4. **Implications and Future Directions:**
   - Importance of understanding APFS's vulnerabilities for iOS hackers and jailbreakers.
   - Potential for improving the design of future filesystems on Apple systems.

This talk aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of APFS, offering valuable insights for both security researchers and the broader iOS community.
