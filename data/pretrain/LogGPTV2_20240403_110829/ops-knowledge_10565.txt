Question: Consider a scenario where an application decodes user input before validating it. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
"A": "Advantage: It allows the application to process encoded characters correctly. Disadvantage: It might decode input twice, leading to bypassing allowlist validation schemes.",
"B": "Advantage: Double decoding increases security by adding an extra layer of validation. Disadvantage: It may be computationally expensive.",
"C": "Advantage: It ensures that inputs are in a consistent internal format before validation. Disadvantage: It could allow dangerous inputs after they have been checked.",
"D": "Advantage: It simplifies the validation process by handling all inputs uniformly. Disadvantage: It may prevent the application from recognizing valid inputs that require encoding."
Answer: AC
