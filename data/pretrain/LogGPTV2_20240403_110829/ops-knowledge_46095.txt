User: While configuring pycharm (professional) for Google App engine it asks for App Engine SDK path, while google now gives everything bundled in a Google cloud SDK. On choosing the cloud SDK directory, pycharm is saying it's invalid. What is the correct path for Google App engine SDK?
Assistant: The correct path to use is the platform/google_appengine/ directory, within the google-cloud-sdk installation directory,
