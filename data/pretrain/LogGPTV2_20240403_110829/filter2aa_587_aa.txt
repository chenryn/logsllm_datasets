Introduction
In 2005, Professor Jay Wexler of Boston University published an article in which 
he purported to identify the funniest sitting United States Supreme Court justice by reviewing 
transcripts of oral arguments and counting the number of times the record reflected laughter.1 
On the surface, this short and enjoyable article seems frivolous, but it raises an interesting 
possibility. Specifically, although the bulk of Supreme Court punditry focuses on specific cases 
or arguments, it is possible to learn things about the justices by aggregate analysis of oral 
arguments. Such an approach will never be a substitute for analysis of policy or legal theory: it 
is issue-neutral. That characteristic, however, is also a strength: the possibility of spotting 
patterns or trends in the way the justices interact might be useful in cases where an individual 
justice’s opinion is in doubt, or where it is desirable to counterbalance possible preconceptions 
of the part of the analyst. At the very least, sifting through the complete library of arguments 
heard by members of the current court can give outsiders a better-rounded view of 
interactions on the court by placing any given oral argument in a broader context.
This paper presents a first attempt at such analysis, using materials available 
from the Oyez Project.2 The research consisted of three major phases: development of software 
tools to facilitate the collection and organization of Supreme Court argument materials, the 
actual use of those tools to harvest data for every case heard by a currently sitting member of 
the Supreme Court, and the analysis and presentation of that material. The goal was to study 
whether it is feasible to draw inferences either about some individual justices or about the 
court as a whole based simply on numerical analysis of case data. The question of whether any 
of the justices have mannerisms at oral argument that telegraph their votes is a complex one, 
and this paper admittedly only scratches the surface of the topic. Nevertheless, even in the 
context of this research, it is possible to observe, for at least four justices, patterns in their

interactions with the advocates that correlate with their eventual votes.
Gathering Argument Data via the Web
Before addressing the specifics of the Oyez web site, a brief explanation of the 
underlying technology involved is warranted to ensure that the reader is acquainted with the 
necessary terms, and can better understand the process involved.
Technical Background
The World Wide Web is a collection of Internet-connected systems sharing data3 
via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Most users experience the Internet by using a web 
browser.4 In this context, a web browser is a piece of software that sends HTTP requests for web 
resources (documents, images, video, etc.) to various web servers which respond to these 
requests by furnishing the requested materials, again via HTTP. For the purposes of this 
discussion, the inner details of HTTP are unimportant, it is enough to understand that HTTP is 
a simple request-response protocol: a client (usually a web browser) issues a request, the server 
responds, and the transaction is complete. The figure below is a transcript of a simple HTTP 
conversation: a client requests a document,5 and the server returns it. The text in bold is issued 
by the client, and the remainder is the server’s response.

Currently popular web browsers include Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, but there have 
been others, such as Netscape Navigator and Mosaic.

This is a test page
The web server’s response begins with a set of “headers:” information about the 
response itself.  The headers let the browser know that the client's request will be honored (the 
“200 OK” response code), the type of web server software in use (Apache),6 the date end time of 
the transaction, and some facts about the response itself: the length of the response (87 bytes), 
and what the response consists of (an HTML document), which begins after the blank line. 
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language,7 a standard for describing both the form and 
the content of a web page. In the example above, the underlined and italicized portions of the 
document are HTML “tags” used to describe the layout of the web page (in this case, which 
portions constitute the title, to be shown in the web browser’s title bar, and which portions 
constitute the body of the document, to be displayed in the browser’s main window).8 The same 
fundamental transaction is played out behind the scenes of every web surfing session: the web 
browser requests some material from a web server, the web server returns a block of data that 
describes both the information to be presented to the user and the format in which the

HTML tags can also describe links, images, forms, and a variety of other document types that might be

information should be presented, and the web browser renders the content for the user in the 
manner directed.
Interacting with the Oyez Web Server
The oyez.org web site provides a facility for the public to review the activities of 
the United States Supreme Court. Specifically, it allows users to browse the docket for any 
given term, view a summary of each case, and even listen to the oral arguments (and in some 
cases also opinion announcements9). As an added feature, the site provides an “expanded view” 
of the oral argument, which displays the transcript of the oral arguments synchronized with 
the original audio. Oral argument transcripts are stored as XML files.10 XML is a specification 
similar to HTML, except its intent is to make content more easily accessible to programs, rather 
than human readers.11
In order to gather the necessary underlying data for this research, two programs 
were developed in the perl programming language.12 Each of these programs basically 
automates a set of actions that could be taken by a human being with a web browser, and 
records the results. The first program systematically downloads the court’s complete docket 
for a given year. Its output is a file containing a list of cases; for each case it records the 
caption, docket number, argument date, decision date, majority decision author, and the vote 
split. Using this program, it was possible to make a master docket list of all cases heard by since 
Justice Scalia was elevated to the court in 1986 up to April 30, 2011.13
The second program is more complex: it takes the master docket file and a list of

11 The files are intended to be parsed by the oral argument display applet that allows those listening to an 
argument to follow along with the text, but the they are just as easily parsed by other software, such as that 
created in the course of this study.

analyzing it.

the current justices as inputs and constructs a series of web requests. There are three main 
outputs:
1. For each case, the program creates a file whose contents reflect whether 
the petitioner or the respondent prevailed, how each justice voted, the 
citation, and who the advocates for each party were.
2. For each justice, the program creates several files: a list of cases in which 
the justice participated, a list of cases the in which the justice did not 
participate, a list of cases in which the justice voted with the majority, a 
list of cases in which the justice voted with the minority, and lists of cases 
in which the justice wrote a concurrence, dissent, or joined another 
justice’s concurrence or dissent.
3. The transcript file for the case’s oral argument.
The net result is a complete collection of each justice’s voting record, along with results and 
oral argument transcripts for every case heard by any combination of the current members of 
the United States Supreme Court. 
Some efforts were required to account for inconsistencies in the data: Oyez is not 
completely faithful to its naming conventions (e.g., in the oral argument transcript files, Justice 
Roberts is sometimes referred to as “John_G_Roberts” and sometimes as “john_g_roberts_jr;” 
Justice Sotomayor is alternately “justice_sotomayor” or “sonia_sotomayor,” and so forth). 
Likewise, some justices (e.g., John Roberts and Elena Kagan) appeared in transcripts as 
advocates before they were elevated to the court.
Limitations
There are a number of important limitations affecting data gathered in this way. 
The first and most obvious has already been mentioned: this analysis places no weight 
-5-
whatsoever on the merits of the case at bar, the issues at stake, or the briefs submitted. It 
makes no sense to think that cases are decided without attention to these factors, and as a 
result, the findings presented here represent a form of insight into Supreme Court 
decision-making that is untethered to the issues surrounding any particular case.
Second, for the purposes of this research, we are accepting Oyez’s analysis of 
which party prevailed in the case. For example, a case might present several questions, some of 
which the court might answer in favor of the petitioner, and some in favor of the respondent, 
making it at least somewhat unclear which party has “won.” A more nuanced analysis might 
take the nature of the issues into account, but that is too complex an undertaking for this 
effort. 
The data from Oyez are also not 100% uniform, and this presents a technical 
problem. When parsing the oral argument files, the only way to decide whether a justice’s 
question is asked of the petitioner or the respondent is by the name of the advocate to whom 
the question is addressed. The Oyez pages summarizing a case name the advocates, but in some 
cases fail to specify which side they represented. Likewise, readers with an actuarial bent will 
notice that for some justices, particularly those who have been on the court the longest, the 
total number of cases heard by the court during a Justice’s tenure is slightly higher than the 
sum of the number of cases in which the Justice voted for the majority, the number of cases in 
which the justice voted for the minority, and the number of cases in which the justice did not 
participate. Again, this represents some minor inconsistency in the way that Oyez has recorded 
the justices’ votes, and the relatively few missing votes could be found through further 
research, but because the margin of error is less than 1%, the degree of extra precision to be 
had by tracking down the missing votes is not worth the rather substantial effort required to 
review hundreds of case records for single voting anomalies. 
The only data-related flaw of substance is that Oyez seems not to have reported 
-6-
the justices’ votes for 78 cases in the 2008 term, as well as 23 other cases between 2006 and 
2010.14 This was only discovered late in the analysis, when producing graphs to detect trends in 
the justices’ voting patterns, and time did not permit tabulation of the votes in these cases.
