### Introduction

In 2005, Professor Jay Wexler of Boston University published an article in which he purported to identify the funniest sitting United States Supreme Court justice by reviewing transcripts of oral arguments and counting the number of times the record reflected laughter.1 While this short and enjoyable article may seem frivolous on the surface, it raises an interesting possibility: aggregate analysis of oral arguments can provide insights into the justices' behavior. Such an approach, though not a substitute for detailed policy or legal theory analysis, offers a neutral, issue-agnostic method to spot patterns or trends in the justices' interactions. This can be particularly useful when a justice's opinion is uncertain or when countering preconceptions is desirable. At the very least, analyzing the complete library of arguments heard by current court members provides a broader context for understanding their interactions.

This paper presents an initial attempt at such analysis using materials from the Oyez Project.2 The research involved three major phases: developing software tools to collect and organize Supreme Court argument materials, using these tools to gather data for every case heard by a currently sitting member of the Supreme Court, and analyzing and presenting the data. The goal was to determine whether numerical analysis of case data can help draw inferences about individual justices or the court as a whole. While the question of whether any justices have mannerisms at oral arguments that predict their votes is complex, this study identifies patterns in the interactions of at least four justices that correlate with their eventual votes.

### Gathering Argument Data via the Web

#### Technical Background

The World Wide Web is a collection of Internet-connected systems sharing data via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Most users interact with the Internet through web browsers, which send HTTP requests for web resources (documents, images, video, etc.) to web servers. These servers respond to requests by furnishing the requested materials. For this discussion, it is sufficient to understand that HTTP is a simple request-response protocol: a client (usually a web browser) issues a request, and the server responds. The figure below shows a simple HTTP transaction, where a client requests a document, and the server returns it.

**Simple HTTP Transaction with the www.foofus.net Web Server**

```
GET /foofus/test.html HTTP/1.0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 25 Apr 2010 15:38:50 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.3 (Unix) PHP/5.2.0 mod_ssl/2.2.3 OpenSSL/0.9.8l

The web server's response includes headers that provide information about the response, such as the status code (200 OK), server type (Apache), date and time, content length, and content type (HTML). HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard for describing both the form and content of a web page. In the example above, the underlined and italicized portions are HTML tags that describe the layout of the web page. Every web surfing session involves similar transactions, where the browser requests material, the server returns data, and the browser renders the content.

#### Interacting with the Oyez Web Server

The Oyez Project website (oyez.org) provides a platform for the public to review the activities of the United States Supreme Court. It allows users to browse the docket for any given term, view case summaries, and listen to oral arguments (and sometimes opinion announcements). The site also offers an "expanded view" of oral arguments, displaying synchronized transcripts and audio. Oral argument transcripts are stored as XML files, a specification designed to make content more accessible to programs.

To gather the necessary data for this research, two Perl programs were developed. The first program systematically downloads the court's complete docket for a given year, recording the caption, docket number, argument date, decision date, majority decision author, and vote split for each case. This program generated a master docket list of all cases heard since Justice Scalia joined the court in 1986 up to April 30, 2011.

The second program takes the master docket file and a list of current justices as inputs and constructs a series of web requests. It produces three main outputs:
1. For each case, a file detailing whether the petitioner or respondent prevailed, how each justice voted, the citation, and the advocates for each party.
2. For each justice, several files listing cases in which they participated, did not participate, voted with the majority, voted with the minority, and wrote concurrences, dissents, or joined other justices' opinions.
3. The transcript file for the caseâ€™s oral argument.

The result is a comprehensive collection of each justice's voting record, along with results and oral argument transcripts for every case heard by any combination of the current Supreme Court members. Some efforts were required to address inconsistencies in the data, such as variations in naming conventions and the appearance of some justices as advocates before their elevation to the court.

#### Limitations

Several limitations affect the data gathered in this way. First, the analysis does not consider the merits of the case, the issues at stake, or the briefs submitted. Second, the study accepts Oyez's determination of which party prevailed, which may be ambiguous in cases with multiple questions. The data from Oyez are not entirely uniform, leading to minor technical issues, such as inconsistent advocate names and missing votes. Additionally, Oyez did not report the justices' votes for 78 cases in the 2008 term and 23 other cases between 2006 and 2010. These limitations, while significant, do not substantially impact the overall findings due to the small margin of error.
