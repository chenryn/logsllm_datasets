  4. Paste the lines into a different program, note that 4 distinct lines are pasted, this is expected behavior.

# Expected behavior
Launching programs inside the terminal should not impact how/when newlines are
preserved.
# Actual behavior
Newlines are preserved when copying multi-line output. After certain
(fullscreen?) applications are launched they no longer are preserved and
pasted output ends up on a single line.
# Isolation notes
Vim isn't the only program this happens with. At first I noticed copy inside
tmux wasn't working the way I expected but then I noticed it happens just by
launching and closing programs like vim and htop. I did a quick scan over the
other copy paste newline bugs and none of them described this behavior but I
might have missed one; sorry if this is a duplicate but I don't think it is.
