Hi!
I'm getting an initial blink while using ReactCSSTransitionGroup because the
added element does not get the -enter class applied when it's attached to the
DOM, even if it gets it immediately after.
For what I can see, the ReactCSSTransitionGroupChild.componentWillEnter is
queued and dispatched after the action that adds the element to the DOM, which
causes this behavior.
Is this a know issue? Wouldn't it make sense for the element to be added with
the -enter class at the moment it's inserted?
Thanks!
