1 Extended Abstract
Through an Anomaly Detection System, unknown attacks could be detected
using a model of normal network behavior to distinguish between usual and un-
usual activities. Collecting representative data of normal activity and properly
train the system are the deciding factors in a Supervised Intrusion Detection
System. This work aims to propose a supervised anomaly detection system to
detect unknown intrusions using the packet payload in the network, implement-
ing its detection algorithm as a “dynamic pre-processor” of Snort. Critical in-
frastructures are exposed to a several threats which demand computer network
protection. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) provides adequate protection
of process control networks. IDSs are usually classiﬁed into misuse/signature
detection and anomaly detection. Signature-based IDS typically exhibit high
detection accuracy because it identiﬁes attacks based on known attack charac-
teristics. Anomaly detection is the alternative approach to detect novel attacks
tagging suspicious events. Learning a model of normal traﬃc and report devia-
tions from the normal behavior is the main strength of anomaly based detection
system. The major weakness is that it is susceptible to false positive alarms.
Supervised technique consists of two diﬀerent phases: training and detection.
Training phase is the critical one because the system needs to collect representa-
tive data from network connections to build an appropriate model which enable
to set up thresholds for intrusion alerts. As such, we focus this work on training
phase which use comparison of connection payloads based on n-grams to facil-
itate bytes sequences analysis and tries to store diﬀerent n-grams occurrences
and simplify searching and comparing sequences.
Considering that Snort is a signature-based IDS and unknown attacks are be-
yond their reach, we propose a supervised anomaly detection system that works
as a Snort dynamic preprocessor in order to have a highly eﬀective detection
within known and unknown attacks. In general, the proposed system takes into
account byte payload sequences represented by ﬁxed-length n-grams and the

correlations among n-gram arranged in a trie data structure. The aim is that
these components enable a system with high performance at training phase and
facilitate more and novel attack detection. Several proposals that make depth
analysis of the payload to detect malicious code are explicated. In this work,
n-grams are used to change bytes from connection payload to sequences of ﬁxed
length n, in order to reduce storage and analysis range. We believe that the sys-
tem could store larger n-gram values to build the correct nor-mal network model
if a trie data structure is used. This approach will increase the detection of un-
known attacks. The classical scheme for storing and comparing n-gram models
utilizes several data structures such as hash table, sorted arrays and suﬃx trees.
However a better alternative for storing and comparing n-grams is a trie data
structure. A trie is an N-ary tree, whose nodes are N-place vectors with compo-
nents corresponding to digits or characters. Tries are considered as an optimal
data structure over n-grams with higher n values applied over NIDS [1].
A payload could be embedded using a trie of n-grams; new n-grams are
represent-ed and the others must be taken into account in the leaves that store
the number of sequence concurrencies. One-way branching with no common pre-
ﬁx are removed to take advantage of redundancy in the stored sequences. A trie
data structure is not only used eﬃciently in computation of similarity measures,
but also in searching and comparing sequences. The main advantages in the way
of storing and retrieving in-formation are: shorter access time, elimination of
n-gram redundancies and inherent symbolic addressing [2]. Supervised system
involves model selection from normal and abnormal datasets. Normal datasets
are used to found patterns in the network and then these patterns are applied
to dataset with attacks to establish rules for detection phase. Particularly, tries
data structures are needed to compare current package n-grams with a previous
one to ﬁnd out a successful network model.
The idea is to perform some tests to determine if the speed in the basic training
phase improves and if it is possible to store larger size of n-grams. Testing is per-
formed taking into account a NIDS based on payload which use Bloom Filter
as a data structure. The Bloom Filter represents diﬀerent n-grams using arrays,
each position denote a sequence of bits with the amount of occurrences, while
tries represents each n-gram as a string of characters. A trie-node denotes a char
in a sequence.
