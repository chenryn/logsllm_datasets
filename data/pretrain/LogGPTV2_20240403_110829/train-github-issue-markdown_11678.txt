### Expected Behavior
Electron to start
### Actual Behavior
Crashes in terminal with error number 2147483651
### To Reproduce
I'm not quite sure what's causing this as I've cloned the `electron-quick-
start` repo and before that I followed the `quick-start` document to a T and
I've set up plenty of Electron projects with no problems like this in the
past. Weirdly enough, it's not working with my project or a new project, but
electron _is_ opening in a older (only by a month or two from now) Electron
project of mine. Apparently it's at 8.2.0
Changed the blank skeleton apps Electron version to 8.2.0 and it worked. This
might be a problem with the Windows version I'm using (Insider Preview), but
I'm confused why 8.2.0 works.
