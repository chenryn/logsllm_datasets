the Internet that caused trafﬁc to enter at a different PoP (this kind of trafﬁc variation was
called an “ingress-shift anomaly” in [6]). In this paper, we analyze trafﬁc shifts caused
by routing changes experienced by our network. Finding a signature of routing-induced
trafﬁc variations for one network is an important ﬁrst step to infer other trafﬁc variations
that are caused by routing changes in other networks.
To analyze these kinds of trafﬁc ﬂuctuations, we deﬁne the variation of a trafﬁc
matrix element at an interval t as:
∆TM(i, e, t) = TM(i, e, t) − TM(i, e, t − 1).
Changes in Trafﬁc Demands Versus Egress Points
3.2
The variation of a trafﬁc matrix element (∆TM) is composed of the load variation (∆L),
which represents volume ﬂuctuations on the trafﬁc demands V , and the routing shifts
(∆R), which accounts for changes in the preﬁx-to-egress mapping ε:
∆TM(i, e, t) = ∆L(i, e, t) + ∆R(i, e, t)
∆L(i, e, t) represents the change in the volume of trafﬁc for all destination preﬁxes
that did not change their egress point from the previous time interval (i.e., ε(i, p, t) =
ε(i, p, t − 1) = e):
∆L(i, e, t) =
V (i, p, t) − V (i, p, t − 1)
(cid:1)
p ∈ P :
ε(i, p, t) = e
ε(i, p, t − 1) = e
Fluctuations in the trafﬁc demands may occur for a variety of reasons, such as changes
in user or application behavior, adaptations caused by end-to-end congestion control, or
even routing changes in other domains.
The routing variation ∆R(i, e, t) considers the destination preﬁxes that shifted to
egress point e during time interval t or shifted from e to another egress point in t:
∆R(i, e, t) =
(cid:1)
V (i, p, t) − (cid:1)
V (i, p, t − 1)
p ∈ P :
ε(i, p, t) = e
ε(i, p, t − 1) (cid:2)= e
p ∈ P :
ε(i, p, t) (cid:2)= e
ε(i, p, t − 1) = e
Note that if a routing change occurs within the time interval t, we associate all of the
trafﬁc associated with that preﬁx in that time interval with the new egress point.
Not all trafﬁc matrix elements carry the same volume of trafﬁc, and the volume of traf-
ﬁc from an ingress to an egress PoP varies over time. How do we judge if a change in the
trafﬁc is “large”? There is no absolute standard: one approach might be to judge the size of
the change in trafﬁc matrix element relative to the average trafﬁc for that element. How-
ever, this is not useful here, because the trafﬁc process itself is non-stationary. It has daily
and weekly cycles, as well as level shifts resulting from routing changes. The relative
change ∆TM(i, e, t)/TM(i, e, t) (or ∆TM(i, e, t)/ max(TM(i, e, t),TM(i, e, t−1)))
seems appealing. However, this metric places too much emphasis on large relative
changes to small values; for example, a trafﬁc matrix element with 1 kbit/sec might

257
easily experience a 50% relative change in trafﬁc without having any signiﬁcant ef-
fect on the network. An alternative metric would be the absolute change ∆TM(i, e, t).
However, a shift of (say) 10 MB/sec may be signiﬁcant for one ingress point but not for
another. Another option would be to normalize the value of ∆TM(i, e, t) by the total
trafﬁc entering ingress point i at time t, which would capture changes in the fraction of
the incoming trafﬁc that uses a particular egress point. However, this metric depends on
the “current” trafﬁc demand at ingress i (which could be low at certain times) and may
not accurately reﬂect the strain imposed on the network by the trafﬁc change. Another
extreme approach would be to consider the capacity of the network, and deﬁne as large
any trafﬁc shift that causes a link to be overloaded. Besides being difﬁcult to compute,
this metric is too closely tied to the current design of the network, and is not useful
for most typical applications of the trafﬁc matrix such as capacity planning or anomaly
detection. Instead, we want a metric that captures properties of the trafﬁc matrix itself,
such as how large the trafﬁc changes are relative to the normal variations of trafﬁc matrix
elements.
2σ(i, e), and ∆ ˜R(i, e, t) = ∆R(i, e, t)/
For that, we should consider what type of process we observe, namely, a difference
process. Over short time periods, we can approximate the trafﬁc with a linear process
yt = α + βt + xt, where xt is a zero-mean stochastic process, with variance σ2. We
observe the differences ∆yt = yt − yt−1, which will form a stationary process, with
mean β and variance 2σ2. Thus we can approximate the difference process by a stationary
process, and measure deviations from the mean, relative to the standard deviation of
this process. We measure 2σ(i, e)2 on the trafﬁc variation process ∆L(i, e,·) (using the
√
standard statistical estimator), and use this to normalize the trafﬁc variations, i.e. we then
observe ∆˜L(i, e, t) = ∆L(i, e, t)/
2σ(i, e).
If the variance of the process xt was time dependent, it might make sense to use a
moving average to estimate the process variance at each point in time, i.e. σ(i, e, t)2,
and use this to normalize the trafﬁc variations. We tried such an approach, but it made
little difference to the results, and so we use the simpler approach described above.
Figure 3 presents a scatter plot of ∆ ˜TM(i, e, t) versus ∆ ˜R(i, e, t) for all the valid
measurement intervals t. The high density of points close to zero shows that large trafﬁc
variations are not very frequent (99.88% of the trafﬁc variations are in the [−4, 4] range).
Points along the horizontal line with ∆ ˜R(i, e, t) = 0 correspond to trafﬁc variations that
are not caused by routing changes, whereas points along the diagonal line correspond
to variations caused almost exclusively by routing changes. Points in the middle are
caused by a mixture of routing changes and load variation. Figure 3 shows that both
load and routing are responsible for some big variations. Routing changes, however, are
responsible for the largest trafﬁc shifts. Indeed, one egress-point change made a trafﬁc
matrix element vary more than 70 times the standard deviation.

Internal Versus External Routing Changes
3.3
The preﬁx-to-egress mapping ε may change because of either internal or external rout-
ing events. External routing changes represent any changes in the set of egress points
that an AS uses to reach a destination preﬁx. For example, in Figure 1, the neighbor AS
might withdraw the route for p2 from the router e, resulting in a change in ε. External

routing changes may be caused by a variety of events, such as an internal routing change
in another domain, a modiﬁcation to the local BGP routing policy, or a failure at the edge
of the network. In contrast, internal routing changes stem from changes in the routing
inside the AS, due to equipment failures, planned maintenance, or trafﬁc engineering.
These events affect the preﬁx-to-egress mapping because the intradomain path costs play
a role in the BGP decision process through the common practice of hot-potato routing.
When selecting a best BGP route, a router ﬁrst considers BGP attributes such as
local preference, AS path length, origin type, and the multiple exit discriminator. If
multiple “equally good” routes remain, the router selects the route with the “closest”
egress point, based on the intradomain path costs. Since large ISPs typically peer with
each other in multiple locations, the hot-potato tie-breaking step almost always drives
the ﬁnal routing decision for destinations learned from peers, although this is much less
common for destinations advertised by customers. In the example in Figure 1, an internal
link failure might make router i’s intradomain path cost to e suddenly larger than the
path to e(cid:2)
. This would change the preﬁx-to-egress mapping for p2, causing a shift in
trafﬁc from egress point e to e(cid:2)
. Using the methodology described in [10], we identiﬁed
which changes in ε were caused by internal events.
Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution functions of ∆ ˜R caused by hot-potato
routing and by external BGP changes. For comparison, we also present the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of a normal distribution, which is drawn from randomly gen-
erated Gaussian data with standard deviation equal 1, because ∆ ˜R has been normalized
to have standard deviation equal 1. Although the routing events are rare (only 0.66%

Fig. 4. Cumulative distribution function of ∆ ˜R caused by hot-potato routing and eBGP
of non-zero ∆ ˜TM are caused by eBGP changes and 0.1% by hot-potato changes), this
result shows that there are signiﬁcant cases where these events are big, to very big. In
particular, approximately 5% of trafﬁc shifts caused by hot-potato routing are at least one
order of magnitude bigger than normal variations. A single internal change is more likely
to affect a large number of destination preﬁxes [10], including the popular destinations
receiving large amounts of trafﬁc.
We analyzed the source of trafﬁc variation for individual trafﬁc matrix elements, and
saw that the likelihood of changes in the preﬁx-to-egress mappings can vary signiﬁcantly
from one ingress router to another. Figures 6 and 5 present the same data as in Figure 3
for two sample trafﬁc matrix elements (Note that the axis are different across the two
graphs.). Some trafﬁc matrix elements have no trafﬁc variation caused by routing changes
(Figure 5), whereas other have few very large egress shifts (Figure 6). We computed the
percent of the trafﬁc matrix elements (i, e) that have large to very large trafﬁc shifts. We
deﬁne large as more than 4 times the normal trafﬁc variations for (i, e) and very large
more than 10 times. Approximately 25% of ingress-egress pairs (i, e) in our study have
no large trafﬁc variation, and the vast majority of them (85.7%) have no very large trafﬁc
variation. The differences across the trafﬁc matrix elements have two main explanations:
– Size of trafﬁc matrix element. Some trafﬁc matrix elements carry little trafﬁc. Most
of the trafﬁc from an ingress router exits the network at few egress PoPs, because of
hot-potato routing. For instance, most of the trafﬁc entering in San Diego is likely to
stay in the west cost. Therefore, the trafﬁc element San Diego to New York carries
very little trafﬁc at any time.

– Impact of internal events. The likelihood of hot-potato routing changes varies
signiﬁcantly from one ingress point to the other [10], depending on the location in
the network and the proximity to the various egress points. For our eight ingress
points, the fraction of BGP routing changes caused by internal events varies from
1% to 40%. As a result, the likelihood of large trafﬁc shifts caused by hot-potato
routing varies signiﬁcantly from one trafﬁc matrix element to another.
