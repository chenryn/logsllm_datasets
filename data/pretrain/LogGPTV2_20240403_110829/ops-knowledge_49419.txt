User: How to use the Docker Compose tool to define and start a set of interdependent container applications, such as WordPress and MySQL?
Assistant: To use the Docker Compose tool to define and start a set of interdependent container applications, follow these steps: 1. Install the Docker Compose tool Run the following command in the command line interface to install Docker Compose: ``` sudo curl -L "https ://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose ``` 2. Create a docker-compose.yml file Create a file called docker-compose.yml and define the containers, networks, volumes, etc. to use in it : ``` version: "3" services: db: image: mysql:5.7 volumes: - db_data:/var/lib/mysql restart: always environment: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress MYSQL_USER: wordpress MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress wordpress: depends_on : - db image: wordpress:latest ports: - "8000:80" restart: always environment: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306 WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress volumes: db_data: ``` 3. Run docker-compose In the command line, enter docker-compose.yml file and run the following command to start the application: ``` docker-compose up -d ``` This will start the WordPress and MySQL containers in the background with default network and volume settings. You can access WordPress by visiting http://localhost:8000 in your browser. Note: On first run, Docker Compose will download the required images from Docker Hub. This may take some time, depending on the speed of your internet connection.
