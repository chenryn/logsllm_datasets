### DailyCatch: Anycast Block Testing and Analysis

**Introduction**
DailyCatch is configured to test anycast blocks, as announced by a large, global Content Delivery Network (CDN), using the transit and all-providers configurations detailed in Section 3.4. In the transit configuration, announcements are made to a restricted set of transit providers, while in the all-providers configuration, announcements are made to nearly all providers. DailyCatch has been operational since August 2017, and the case studies presented here are based on data collected during this period. The primary goal is to demonstrate the utility of DailyCatch rather than provide a comprehensive measurement of peering policies.

**4.2.1 Biggest Movers**
We first examine the largest (both positive and negative) scores generated by DailyCatch for a single day during the test period. Table 2 presents the three highest and lowest scores for both North America (left) and Europe (right). AS numbers are masked with letters to protect provider-level operational data.

| **NA Group** | **Probes** | **RTTtx** | **RTTall** | **vд** | **Score** |
|--------------|------------|-----------|------------|--------|----------|

| Z / US-AZ    | 13         | 21.8      | 27.8       | 0.013  | -0.008   |

| **EU Group** | **Probes** | **RTTtx** | **RTTall** | **vд** | **Score** |
|--------------|------------|-----------|------------|--------|----------|
| D / FR       | 70         | 19.8      | 10.2       | 0.025  | 0.019    |
| E / GB       | 60         | 21.0      | 21.0       | 0.024  | 0.013    |

| W / PT       | 11         | 16.9      | 40.8       | 0.004  | -0.004   |
| V / ES       | 7          | 7.7       | 37.4       | 0.009  | -0.009   |

**Analysis of Scores**
The groups with high scores generally have higher vд values, though not exclusively (e.g., Note Z / US-AZ). This suggests that, in networks critical to the CDN, the experimental configuration (announcing to more peers) improves performance. The causes of these scores can be categorized into three broad categories:
1. **Catchment Shifts**: Upstream providers prefer to send traffic across peering links, leading to improved performance for groups like B/US-CO, C/US-OR, D/FR, E/GB, and F/IT.
2. **Path Changes (without Catchment Shifts)**: Groups like A/US-MN and Z/US-AZ see performance changes due to faster or slower routes to the same site.
3. **Transient, Anomalous Behavior**: Small groups, such as Y/US-NC, may show significant variation due to the impact of a single outlier.

**Operational Use**
DailyCatch's ability to subdivide ASes by country or US state allows for the identification of specific group-level changes. For example, AS B shows changes in both directions, which would otherwise be averaged out and hidden. By weighting the changes by relative volume, DailyCatch identifies the most impactful sites for peering link additions. This targeted approach, enabled by group-level scoring and path information, is crucial for practical, operational use.

**False Positives and Small Groups**
A false positive is observed in Group Y/US-NC, where one probe sees significantly worse performance, but another probe on an almost identical path shows good behavior. The low vд weight for Y/US-NC results in only a small negative contribution. Despite this, small groups like C/US-OR can provide meaningful data, justifying their inclusion.

**Summary**
Many of the large changes in Table 2 result from significant shifts in both the location and routing of client behavior. Key design decisions, such as subdividing by geolocation, including small probe groups, and weighting by relative volume, have been validated. These variations highlight the complexity of anycast and provider interactions, emphasizing the importance of sub-AS groupings.

**4.2.2 Cause of Catchment Shifts**
Table 3 highlights three notable positive score changes. These groups suffer from poor site selection when relying on transit providers, connecting to San Jose instead of a nearby site in Denver. Manual inspection reveals a policy choice: the origin ASes prefer to route through a transit provider not available at the Denver site. In the all-providers configuration, probes now have access to a direct peering link, improving performance.

| **Group** | **Probes** | **RTTtx** | **RTTall** | **vд** | **Score** | **Catchmenttx** | **Catchmentall** |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|--------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| A / US-CO | 21         | 35.36     | 10.70      | 0.0163 | 0.0098   | San Jose        | Denver           |
| B / US-CO | 4          | 45.03     | 20.23      | 0.0132 | 0.0066   | San Jose        | Denver           |
| A / US-UT | 3          | 35.82     | 21.00      | 0.0023 | 0.0009   | San Jose        | Denver           |

**Advantages of DailyCatch**
BGP collector data suggests that, in the transit configuration, these groups should route to a site in Denver. Active measurements by DailyCatch reveal the impact of opaque BGP policies, showing that performance can be improved directly by announcing to additional peers without explicit provider cooperation.

**4.2.3 Mixed Impact Scenarios**
Figure 12 illustrates the difference in RTT for groups from three large North American ASes. The groups vary significantly in size, ranging from 4 probes to over 70, but group size does not correlate with observed performance. For example, clients in Colorado achieved a nearly 13ms improvement, while clients in New Mexico had an almost 20ms penalty, a spread of more than 30ms. Similar behaviors are seen in other ASes.

**Network Policies and Peering Links**
Groups that performed worse generally have a direct path performing poorly. Providers prefer peering links when available, which can alter catchments and user-experienced latency. DailyCatch provides visibility into the behavior of individual groups at specific sites, generating the necessary data to address issues by adding peering or reconfiguring announcements.

**5. Discussion**
In this section, we discuss two important topics related to DailyCatch’s use: the representativeness of the RIPE Atlas platform and the network misconfigurations that necessitate an active measurement approach for managing multi-provider anycast announcement configurations.

**5.1 RIPE Atlas Representation**
At the time of writing, RIPE Atlas consists of over 10,000 globally distributed probes. However, only 19% of IPv4 ASes seen by the studied CDN contain at least one RIPE Atlas probe. When considering the weighted fraction of requests, 61% of inbound volume originates from networks with at least one probe. This leaves some networks with insufficient coverage. To explore these networks, we define the mismatch, M, as:

\[ M = \frac{1 + e^v}{P} \times P_{\text{target}} \]

where \( P \) is the number of probes in a given AS, \( v \) is its relative volume, and \( P_{\text{target}} \) is the target probe count.

**Conclusion**
DailyCatch provides valuable insights into the behavior of anycast blocks and the impact of different announcement configurations. By leveraging active measurements and sub-AS groupings, it addresses the complexities of anycast and provider interactions, enabling better management and optimization of CDN performance.
