ORDER
Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Vivendi Games, Inc. (collectively, “Blizzard”) are
the creators and operators of a multiplayer online role-playing game known as World of
Warcraft (“WoW”).  WoW was released in November of 2004.  WoW players control
characters within a virtual universe, exploring the landscape, fighting monsters, performing

1 The record contains several different versions of the EULA and TOU.  The parties
agreed at oral argument that the most recent versions – the February 2, 2007 EULA and the
October 16, 2006 TOU – are the operative agreements for purposes of the summary judgment
motions.  See Dkt. #41-8, 42.  The Court therefore will not address the earlier versions.

quests, building skills, and interacting with other players and computer-generated characters.
As players succeed, they acquire in-game assets, experience, and power.  Players can
advance from level 1 to level 60 with the basic game, and through level 70 with an expansion
module. 
Blizzard owns the copyright for WoW software.  The software consists of two
components:  the “game client” software and the “game server” software.  A user can obtain
the game client software by purchasing a copy at a retail store or downloading a copy from
the WoW website.  The user plays WoW by loading the game client software on his personal
computer and accessing the game server software through an online account for which he
pays a monthly fee.
Use of WoW is governed by an End User License Agreement (“EULA”) and  Terms
of Use Agreement (“TOU”).  These agreements are displayed on a player’s computer screen
when the game client software is loaded and the player seeks online access to the game
servers.  Players are required to agree to the terms of the EULA and TOU before proceeding
to play the game.1
WoW has been enormously successful.  Blizzard asserts, and MDY does not dispute,
that WoW is the largest and most successful multiplayer online game in the world.  WoW
currently has some 10,000,000 active players and generates more than $1.5 billion in revenue
annually.
Michael Donnelly is the founder of MDY Industries, LLC (“MDY”).  Donnelly
created, and MDY owns, a software program known as WowGlider (“Glider”).  Glider is a
computer program known as a “bot” – a word derived from “robot.”  Glider plays WoW for
its owner while the owner is away from his or her computer.  Glider thereby enables the
owner to advance more quickly within WoW than would otherwise be possible.  MDY began
selling Glider to WoW users in June of 2005.  To date, it has sold some 100,000 copies.

Blizzard contends that Glider diminishes the value of WoW and causes Blizzard to
lose customers and revenue.  Blizzard asserts that WoW is a carefully balanced competitive
environment where players compete against each other and the game to advance through the
game’s various levels and to acquire game assets.  Blizzard claims that Glider upsets this
balance by enabling some payers to advance more quickly and unfairly, diminishing the
game experience for other players.  Blizzard also contends that Glider enables its users to
acquire an inordinate number of game assets – sometimes referred to as “mining” or
“farming” the game – with some users even selling those assets for real money in online
auction sites, an activity expressly prohibited by the TOU.  Dkt. #41. Ex. 8, ¶ 8.
MDY, by contrast, claims that Glider enhances the game playing experience of its
users and even enables some disabled users to play WoW.  MDY contends that Glider users
constitute a small fraction of WoW players and that the effect of Glider on WoW is minimal.
MDY characterizes itself as an innovator and entrepreneur, and claims that Blizzard seeks
improperly to use the copyright laws to squelch competition and stifle innovation.
On the morning of October 25, 2006, representatives of Blizzard appeared at
Donnelly’s home and informed him that the sale and use of Glider violated Blizzard’s rights
in WoW.  The representatives stated that they would file a lawsuit against Donnelly and
MDY the next day in California federal court if MDY did not agree to stop selling Glider.
Donnelly declined, and later that day filed this action in Arizona.  See Dkt. #1.  
MDY’s amended complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that Glider does not infringe
rights owned by Blizzard.  Dkt. #5.  Blizzard filed a counterclaim and third-party complaint
asserting seven claims:  tortious interference with contract, contributory copyright
infringement, vicarious copyright infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (“DMCA”), trademark infringement, unfair competition, and unjust
enrichment.  Dkt. #10.
The parties have now filed motions for summary judgment.  Blizzard seeks summary
judgment on the claims for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, violation of
the DMCA, and tortious interference with contract (Counts I-IV).  Dkt. #39.  MDY seeks

summary judgment on all claims except trademark infringement (Count V).  Dkt. #45.  The
parties have fully briefed the issues (Dkt. ##39, 45, 54, 57, 69-70) and the Court heard oral
argument on June 26, 2008 (Dkt. #78).  For reasons stated below, the Court will grant the
motions in part and deny them in part.2
I.
Summary Judgment Standard.
Summary judgment may be granted if “there is no genuine issue as to any material
fact” and “the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).
A party seeking summary judgment “always bears the initial responsibility of informing the
district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which
it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome
of the suit will preclude the entry of summary judgment, and the disputed evidence must be
“such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Anderson v.
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). 
II.
Blizzard’s Copyright Infringement Claims (Counts II and III).
Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants the owner of a copyright the exclusive right
to “copy” the copyrighted work; that is, to make a copy of the work, to prepare derivative
works based on the work, or to distribute copies of the work to the public.  17 U.S.C.
§ 106(1)-(3); see S.O.S., Inc. v. Payday, Inc., 886 F.2d 1081, 1085 n.3 (9th Cir. 1989)
(“copying” is shorthand for the copyright owner’s exclusive rights).  Section 501 of the Act
provides that “[a]nyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as
provided by section[] 106 . . . is an infringer of the copyright[.]”  17 U.S.C. § 501(a).
Copyright plaintiffs must therefore satisfy two requirements to establish direct infringement:
(1) they must show that they own the allegedly infringed copyright, and (2) they must show
that the alleged infringer has violated at least one of the exclusive rights granted under
section 106.  See A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1013 (9th Cir. 2001).

3 The Court permitted the public interest group Public Knowledge to file an amicus
brief in this case (Dkt. ##74-75), and required Blizzard to respond to its arguments
(Dkt. ##76-77).  Public Knowledge and the other parties have provided many helpful legal
arguments.  They also make various policy arguments.  Although the Court appreciates these
policy arguments and has benefitted from their excellent presentation, the Court is not a
policy-making body.  The Court’s obligation is to apply the law, particularly the law of the
Ninth Circuit.  As will be seen below, many of the issues in this case are governed by
established Ninth Circuit law.  No matter how persuasive arguments might be for positions
contrary to Ninth Circuit law, this Court is not free to depart from that law.

A person commits contributory copyright infringement “by intentionally inducing or
encouraging direct infringement.”  MGM Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 930
(2005).  A person commits vicarious infringement “by profiting from direct infringement
while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it[.]”  Id.  Blizzard alleges that users of
WoW are licensees who are permitted to copy the copyrighted game client software only in
conformance with the EULA and TOU, and that when users launch WoW using Glider, they
exceed the license in the EULA and TOU and create infringing copies of the game client
software.  Dkt. #10 ¶¶ 80-83, 91-92.  MDY is liable for contributory copyright infringement,
Blizzard claims, because it materially contributes to this direct infringement by Glider users.
MDY allegedly does so  by developing and selling Glider with the knowledge that Glider
users will create infringing copies.  Id. ¶¶ 85-87.  MDY is liable for vicarious copyright
infringement, Blizzard asserts, because it has the ability to stop the Glider-caused infringing
activity and derives a financial benefit from that activity.  Id. ¶¶ 93-95.
MDY does not dispute that it promotes the use of Glider in connection with WoW,
that it controls Glider, or that it profits from Glider.  MDY instead contends that it is not
liable for contributory or vicarious copyright infringement because Glider users do not
infringe Blizzard’s copyright.  Dkt. #45 at 7-12.  If Glider users violate terms of the EULA
and TOU, MDY argues, they are merely breaching a contract, not infringing a copyright.  Id.
MDY also asserts a copyright misuse defense and an ownership defense under 17 U.S.C.
