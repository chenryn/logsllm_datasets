User: I'm developing a task where I need to have a few pieces of information specific to the environment.
I setup the ~/.fabricrc file but when I run the task via command line, the data is not in the env variable
I don't really want to add the -c config to simplify the deployment.
in the task, I'm calling 

env.cb_account

and I have in ~/.fabricrc 

cb_account=foobar

it throws AttributeError
Has anybody else run into this problem?
I found the information when I view env outside of my function/task. So now the question is how do I get that information into my task? I already have 6 parameters so I don't think it would be wise to add more especially when those parameters wouldn't change.
Assistant: Overrode the "env" variable via parameter in the function. Dumb mistake.
