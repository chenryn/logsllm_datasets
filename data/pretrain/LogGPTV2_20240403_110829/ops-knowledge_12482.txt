User: How come I can't do anything else on terminal when It's running a localhost. Like I run a google app engine on it and make a new local host, I for example try to see what directory I'm in or even change directories, it doesn't respond to any of my requests? Thank you
Assistant: That instance of the terminal will be busy doing the thing you asked it to. But you can just open a new window or tab.
