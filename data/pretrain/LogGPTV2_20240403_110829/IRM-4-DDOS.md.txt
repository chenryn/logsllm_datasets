INCIDENT HANDLING STEPS
6 STEPS ARE DEFINED TO HANDLE SECURITY INCIDENTS
1. Preparation: get ready to handle the incident
2. Identification: detect the incident
3. Containment: limit the impact of the incident
4. Remediation: remove the threat
5. Recovery: recover to a normal stage
6. Lessons learned: draw up and improve the process
IRM provides detailed information for each stepof the incident response process.The steps
come from NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.

OBJECTIVE: ESTABLISH CONTACTS, DEFINE PROCEDURES, GATHER INFORMATION TO SAVE
TIMEDURINGANINCIDENT.
InternetServiceProvidersupport
▪ ContactyourISPtounderstandtheDDoSmitigationservicesitoffers(freeandpaid)andwhatprocess
youshouldfollow.
▪ Ifpossible,subscribetoaredundantInternetconnectionandtoanAnti-DDoSservicesprovider.
▪ EstablishcontactswithyourISPandlawenforcemententities.Makesurethatyouhavethepossibility
touseanout-of-bandcommunicationchannel(e.g.:phone).
▪ MakesureyourISPandDDoSmitigationservicehavea24/7phonesupport.
Inventory
▪ Create a whitelist of the IP addresses and protocols you must allow if prioritizing traffic during an
attack.Don’tforgettoincludeyourcriticalcustomers,keypartners,etc.
▪ Document your IT infrastructure details, including business owners, IP addresses and circuit IDs,
routingsettings(AS,etc);prepareanetworktopologydiagramandanassetinventory.
Networkinfrastructure
▪ DesignagoodnetworkinfrastructurewithoutSinglePointofFailureorbottleneck.
▪ DeployaWebApplicationFirewalltoprotectagainstapplication-layerDDoS.
▪ DistributeyourDNSserversandothercriticalservices(SMTP,etc)throughdifferentAS.
▪ Hardentheconfigurationofnetwork,OS,andapplicationcomponentsthatmaybetargetedbyDDoS.
▪ Baseline your current infrastructure’s performance, so you can identify the attack faster and more
accurately.
▪ If your business is Internet dependent, consider purchasingspecialized DDoS mitigationproducts or
services.
▪ Confirm DNS time-to-live (TTL) settings for the systems that might be attacked. Lower the TTLs, if
necessary, to facilitate DNS redirection if the original IP addresses get attacked. 600 is a good TTL
value.
▪ Depending of the criticality of your services, consider setting-up a backup that you can switch on in
caseofissue.
Internalcontacts
▪ EstablishcontactsforyourIDS,firewall,systems,andnetworkteams.
▪ Collaborate with the business lines to understand business implications (e.g., money loss) of likely
DDoSattackscenarios.
▪ InvolveyourBCP/DRplanningteamonDDoSincidents.

Communication
▪ PrepareaninternalandanexternalcommunicationtemplateaboutDDoSincidents.
▪ Identifychannelwherethiscommunicationwillbeposted.
▪ The “preparation” phase is to be considered as the most important element of a successful DDoS
incidentresponse.
Analyzetheattack
▪ Keep in mind the DDoS attack could be a smokescreen hiding a more sophisticated and targeted
attack.
▪ Checkyouranti-DDoSserviceanalysisandyourscrubbingcentrereports:
o Understand the logical flow of the DDoS attack and identify the infrastructure components
affectedbyit.
o Understandifyouarethetargetoftheattackoracollateralvictim.
▪ Review the load and log files of servers, routers, firewalls, applications, and other affected
infrastructure.

▪ Attempt to throttle or block DDoS traffic as close to the network’s “cloud” as possible via a router,
firewall,loadbalancer,specializeddevice,etc.
▪ TerminateunwantedconnectionsorprocessesonserversandroutersandtunetheirTCP/IPsettings.
▪ If possible, switch to alternate sites or networks using DNS or another mechanism. Blackhole DDoS

▪ Setupanalternatecommunicationchannelbetweenyouandyourusers/customers(e.g.:webserver,
mailserver,voiceserver,etc.).
▪ If possible, route traffic through a traffic-scrubbing service or product via DNS or routing changes
(e.g.:sinkholerouting).
▪ Configure egress filters to block the traffic your systems may send in response to DDoS traffic (e.g.:
backsquattertraffic),toavoidaddingunnecessarypacketstothenetwork.
▪ Incaseofanextortionattempt,trytobuytimewiththefraudster.Forexample,explainthatyouneed

If the bottleneck is at the ISP’s or anti-DDoS service’s side, only they can take efficient
