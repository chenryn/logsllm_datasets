### Web-based Inference Detection for Document Redaction

#### Introduction
This document discusses the use of web-based inference detection to improve the redaction process, ensuring that sensitive information is removed while maintaining readability. The approach balances performance and readability, though it is not optimal in either regard.

#### Case Study: Osama Bin Laden Biography
- **Context**: Many of Osama Bin Laden's relatives reside in Boston.
- **Family Background**: Osama’s father was a building magnate.
- **Denunciation**: Several groups, including Bin Laden’s family, have denounced and condemned his actions.

#### Redaction Process
1. **Initial Redaction**:
   - Removed all location references, dates near September 11, 2001, and citation titles.
   - Example: "Boston" and "September 11, 2001" were redacted.

2. **Iterative Redaction**:
   - Extracted text from the current document.
   - Calculated keywords using TF.IDF metric.
   - Searched for inferences drawn from subsets of top keywords.
   - Evaluated links to ensure they reflected identifying inferences about Osama Bin Laden.

3. **Manual Review**:
   - Manually reviewed links to confirm their validity.
   - Example: A query for "condone citing prestigious" yielded a humor site with an unrelated article title containing "Osama," but no relevant content.

4. **Redaction Steps**:
   - Dates, citation titles, and location names were removed.
   - For i = 2 to 5, executed Google queries for i-tuples of top keywords.
   - Reviewed returned links to determine if all keywords were used in discussions about Osama Bin Laden.
   - Made redactions to prevent valid inferences and repeated the process.

#### Results
- **Redacted Words**: 
  - **Word/Phrase**: "Boston"
    - **Link**: [Example Link]
    - **Reason**: Many of Osama Bin Laden's relatives reside in Boston.
  - **Word/Phrase**: "building magnate"
    - **Link**: [Example Link]
    - **Reason**: Identifies Osama Bin Laden's father's profession.
  - **Word/Phrase**: "denounced, denunciation, condemnation"
    - **Link**: [Example Link]
    - **Reason**: Indicates actions taken by groups, including Bin Laden’s family.

#### Algorithm Performance
- **Keyword Selection**: Chose (i, ni) values based on performance constraints.
- **Validation**: Only 7% of links for (i, ni) = (4, 15) were valid.
- **Missed Inferences**: Some unusual attributes (e.g., having 50 or more siblings) were not redacted due to limited NLP use.

#### Challenges
- **Privacy Concerns**: Redacting "Boston" without "Globe" might still allow the term to be inferred.
- **Algorithm Improvements**: Deeper content analysis and better filtering are needed for real-time applications.

#### Conclusion
- **Web-based Inference Detection**: Demonstrates the power of the web in finding keywords that can identify a person or topic.
- **Future Work**: Real-time functionality, improved precision, and deeper semantic analysis are needed.
