  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I think there is no actual page behind the component demo's and the link
should probably just open the sub navigation
## Current Behavior
As there is no actual page for the sub menu header, the link results in a 404.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Navigate to https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/getting-started/usage/
  2. In the bottom paragraph there is a link to the components demo's
  3. https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/component-demos
  4. 404
