User:  What Causes Packet Loss and Latency in Data Center Networks
Assistant: Possible causes of failure: 1. Network congestion: When the data flow in the network exceeds the processing capacity of the network, it will cause network congestion, resulting in packet loss and delay. 2. Hardware failure: When a device in the network fails or is misconfigured, data packets in the network will be lost or delayed. 3. Software problems: Software problems in the network, such as application errors, operating system problems, etc., may also cause network packet loss and delay.
