I'm building a reinforcement learning framework on top of TensorFlow 2.0 using
the `tf.keras` API and I've come across the following issue.
The 2.0 API docs for `tf.keras.losses` shows many objects that are not
actually available in the preview package. For example the loss classes such
as Huber. Hinge, etc... are not accessible.
  1. Why are those classes not included in the preview package?
  2. Why are there both classes and functions for many of the same loss types? That seems like unnecessary duplication.  
2a. Why is there a `Huber` class but no `huber` function?
  3. I'd love to contribute PRs and help fix these issues. Would that be desired?
