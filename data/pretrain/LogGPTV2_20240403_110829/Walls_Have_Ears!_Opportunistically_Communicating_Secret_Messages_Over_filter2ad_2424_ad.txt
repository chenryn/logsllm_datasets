are more preferred due to their high eﬃciency. As discussed
in Section 2.2.2, for Type-II wiretap code, C1 must be a
capacity-achieving code to guarantee secrecy. Intuitively, it
seems that selecting a capacity-achieving code as C2 is also
the best choice. However, our following ﬁndings reveal that
the use of a non-capacity-achieving code for C2 can enhance
the security strength by sacriﬁcing moderate transmission
rate.
Lemma 1. Assume code C2 is a length-n LDPC code for
a BEC() with threshold ∗ and code rate r, H2 is the
parity-check matrix of C2, Z the BEC()-attenuated ver-
sion of transmitted codeword X, and θ is the equivocation
loss/information entropy loss after decoding by H2Z = 0. If
∗ ≤ 1 − r, ∗ ≤  ≤ 1, then θ can be controlled in the range
n∗ ≤ θ ≤ n(1 − r) by adjusting the relationship between
∗,  and r.
Proof. When ∗ ≤  ≤ 1, θ increases with the increase
of . The equivocation loss/information entropy loss θ after
decoding is determined by the rank of columns correspond-
ing to the erased bits in H2. Because rank(H2) = n(1 − r),
we have θ ≤ n(1 − r). We next deﬁne two erasure chan-
nels BEC(1) and BEC(2) with 1  ∗ for the eavesdropper’s channel, where the

In this section, we provide a comprehensive simulation
study to evaluate the system performance. In the next sec-
tion, we further implement the wiretap channel in a real
system and report experimental performance results. The
following metrics are used to evaluate the system perfor-
mance in both simulation and experimental studies.
• Equivocation (E): E is deﬁned as the entropy of Md,
where Md is a random variable representing the mes-
sage decoded by the eavesdropper, and the original
message set is denoted by M. Therefore, E = H(Md) =
m∈M pm log pm, where pm is the probability that
−(cid:80)
Md = m.
• Bit Error Rate (BER): the ratio of the number of bits
in the decoded message diﬀerent from the original mes-
sage to the total number of bits in the original message.
• Block Error Rate (BLER): the ratio of the number of
decoded messages diﬀerent from the original messages
to the total number of the original messages.
Here, E and BLER are used to measure the system secu-
rity performance and reliability performance, respectively.
Note that, we can use BER to measure both the system se-
curity performance (with respect to the eavesdropper) and
reliability performance (with respect to the legitimate re-
ceiver).
To evaluate the system performance, our strategy is to
randomly generate a message, and then encode the message
thousands of times to get thousands of wiretap codewords,
which are transmitted over the main channel and the eaves-
dropper’s channel. Note that, the number of times to encode
and transmit a message increases exponentially with the in-
crease of the message bit length k. As a result, it is extremely
time-consuming to evaluate the system performance on the
oﬀ-the-shelf machines when the message bit length is rela-
tively large. Without loss of generality, to solve this problem
and improve the practicality of the system, we limit k to be
a small value in our simulations and experiments, say 10bits.
Note that the message length does not aﬀect the evaluation
of the system security and reliability performance.
5.1 Wiretap Code Implementation
In this subsection, we present the implementation details
of wiretap codes introduced in Section 2.2.
Theoretically, we need to convert the BSC with cross-over
probability p(p 
e × n LDPC parity-check
Ce. Then we can construct a nC +
matrix H as the generator matrix G in X = (GT
For a non-capacity-achieving LDPC code, we can determine
k = n(1− C +
e ). To obtain G1, we generate a k1 × n (k1 > k)
parity-check matrix, from which k rows are selected as G1’s
k independent vectors x1, . . . , xk satisfying Hexi (cid:54)= 0, where
HHT
e = 0, i.e., He is the parity-check matrix of H when
H is used as G. To implement Type-II Wiretap Code, we
also choose a ﬁxed codeword length n. Based on Cm and
Ce, we ﬁrst construct an n(1 − r1) × n parity-check matrix
H1 (we assume C1 is a capacity-achieving LDPC code for
ease of exposition, however, according to Theorem 3 a non-
capacity-achieving LDPC code can also be used for C1 with-
out loss of privacy guarantee). So we have r1 = Ce. Then,
we select n(1 − r2) rows from H1 as H2 (corresponding to
a non-capacity-achieving LDPC code C2), where Cm > r2
and H2 ensures the reliability at the receiver. Finally, the
remaining n(r2 − r1) rows constitute H2.
In our system design, we introduce transmission rate trade-
oﬀs to enhance the system security (i.e., message secrecy)
and make the Type-I and Type-II codes practical in real sys-
tems by alleviating the theoretical assumption of requiring
a large codeword length n. In the simulation study, since
we mainly focus on evaluating the eﬀects of transmission
rate tradeoﬀ ∆ on the system performance, the capacities of
both the main channel and the eavesdropper’s channel are
assumed to remain constant over time.
5.2 Performance Evaluation for the Noiseless
Main Channel
When the main channel is noiseless, Type-I code is adopted
for encoding. We only evaluate the secrecy performance
since channel reliability is readily satisﬁed for a noiseless
channel. We evaluate the performance under diﬀerent code-
word length n and transmission rate tradeoﬀ ∆. Note that
we keep the coding matrices (or say C +
e ) and message length
unchanged but change the tradeoﬀ value, the real capacity
of the eavesdropper’s channel will change correspondingly.
Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the uniformly randomly
generated messages and its equivocation E = 9.9921. We
call this distribution as perfect distribution, which is used as
the benchmark. Figs. 7, 8 and 9 show the distributions of

the received messages at the eavesdropper for diﬀerent val-
ues of n and ∆, respectively. Generally speaking, the more
similar between the distribution of the received messages
and the perfect distribution, the higher message secrecy of
the system.
As can be observed, the distribution of received messages
becomes more and more similar to the perfect distribution
when the transmission rate tradeoﬀ ∆ increases for the same
codeword length n. Accordingly, as shown in Table 1, the
equivocation E increases as the value of transmission rate
tradeoﬀ ∆ increases for the same codeword length n. It is
shown that when n = 60 and ∆ = 0.32, the equivocation
E = 9.9923, which is very close to 9.9921, i.e., the equiv-
ocation of perfect distribution. Therefore, we can conclude
that the system achieves nearly perfect secrecy by introduc-
ing the transmission rate tradeoﬀ. More importantly, it can
be observed that the introduction of ∆ can also weaken the
inﬂuence of the codeword length n to the message secrecy
performance. Meanwhile, by introducing the tradeoﬀ the
bit error rate BERe is very close to 0.5, which also implies
that the system achieves nearly perfect secrecy. Moreover,
as expected, only a smaller ∆ is required for a larger n to
achieve the same equivocation.
It is worth noting that in theory the wiretap channel
achieves perfect secrecy when the codeword length goes to
inﬁnity. However, with the help of the transmission rate
tradeoﬀ, the wiretap channel can also achieve nearly perfect
secrecy even for a small codeword length, which validates
the correctness of Theorem 1.
5.3 Performance Evaluation for the Noisy Main
Channel
We next consider the second scenario where the main
channel is noisy and Type-II wiretap code is adopted for
message encoding. Note that we keep the message length
unchanged but change r2, and thus Ce and r1 will change
correspondingly.

sages under diﬀerent values of n and ∆. As in the noiseless
