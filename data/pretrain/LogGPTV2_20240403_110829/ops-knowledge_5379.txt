To clarify and enhance the given text, it seems you're trying to confirm the configuration of a proxy server. Here's a more professional and clear way to phrase it:

"Please confirm that the log indicates the following: The proxy server at `proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070` is being used, and the connection is established via HTTPS."

If you are looking for a template or a more generic version, you could use:

"Please confirm that the log indicates the following: The proxy server at `<hostname>:<port>` is being used, and the connection is established via HTTPS."

In this context, `<hostname>` would be `proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk` and `<port>` would be `5070`.
