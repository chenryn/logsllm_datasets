Question: An iOS application developer intends to store a user's authentication token securely on the device. Which of the following methods and attributes would be most appropriate to ensure the data is protected using the cryptographic hardware available on iOS devices?
"A": "Use `NSUserDefaults` with the attribute `FileProtectionType.complete` to ensure the data is encrypted using hardware-backed encryption.",
"B": "Use `NSFileManager` to create a file with the attribute `FileAttributeKey.protectionKey: FileProtectionType.complete` to secure the authentication token with hardware-backed encryption.",
"C": "Store the authentication token in a SQLite Database without any additional encryption, as SQLite provides sufficient security by default.",
"D": "Save the authentication token in a plist file using `NSDataWritingFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen`, which only encrypts the file when the device is locked."
Answer: B
