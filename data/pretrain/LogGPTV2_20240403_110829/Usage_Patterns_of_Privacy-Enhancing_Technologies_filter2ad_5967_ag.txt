### 11.5 WHERE CAN INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION HELP?

In Europe, the EU privacy directive has been widely implemented in national legislation, regulating, for example, the exchange of private data between public administrations. The directive builds on many earlier sources, such as the OECD privacy principles, but it does not provide a comprehensive conceptual framework. On a national basis, many provisions must be coordinated to ensure conceptual compatibility and support a common goal of privacy. The most significant challenge is the lack of common concepts for describing privacy issues and solutions, such as a common classification of private information or a standard description of usage scenarios representing classes of privacy threats.

Given the global nature of electronic services, close international cooperation is essential to implement a common policy for protecting citizens' privacy. In related areas, such as combating spam or preventing dialer abuse, it has proven difficult to involve all governments and private players in the implementation of common controls. Similarly, creating a broad consensus on a specific common privacy policy is likely to be challenging.

International cooperation in the privacy field is expected to be most useful in research and development, particularly in establishing common terminologies and concepts for classifying private data, issues, and usage scenarios. Sharing experiences from concrete initiatives can also be of significant value. However, it must be recognized that privacy awareness and end-user attitudes toward possible solutions can vary significantly between countries, influenced by cultural factors and IT maturity.

### 12 PRIVACY TRENDS AND ISSUES

As described earlier in this report, several privacy issues are still candidates for additional research, and many privacy solutions are still in the conceptual development stage. This chapter presents significant trends and issues, illustrating ways to better understand today’s privacy challenges and apply relevant technologies and methods to protect the privacy of users of electronic services.

#### 12.1 TREND: DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

To improve general knowledge and awareness of privacy issues and solutions, organizations are launching demonstration projects where well-known transactions or interactions are performed without the usual user identification, using alternative means and technologies to establish the necessary transactional link. These technologies may include biometrics, smart cards, or other ID tokens. Privacy demonstration projects are relevant in various sectors, such as health services, shopping, social benefits, investments, and travel cards. A valuable demonstration begins with an analysis and possible redesign of the business model and information flow. Unfortunately, the results of these demonstrations (regarding user acceptance, cost, effort, benefits, and possible side effects) are not always published; instead, they are often used as internal tools to improve traditional business processes.

#### 12.2 TREND: ACCEPTANCE SURVEYS

Another common initiative is conducting surveys to gauge public perception of privacy issues and the value of privacy. Surveys that include respondents who have experienced the issues and tried the solutions are more qualified than opinion polls involving a random audience. The most valuable acceptance surveys are conducted in conjunction with selected demonstration projects, where participants have firsthand experience using PET solutions, such as implementing P3P technology for selected sites or services.

#### 12.3 TREND: PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS IN E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES

A large number of e-Government services are being deployed to introduce self-service and reduce administrative costs. However, these services often replicate the manual administration process electronically. Introducing privacy protection as part of the solution design when building or revising these services would be highly valuable. A privacy-aware design ensures that users have access to a clear and well-structured privacy policy, certainty that the service complies with the policy, easy choices of privacy options with sensible defaults, and a helpful guide explaining the choices. The privacy-protecting components could be developed as common patterns to be included in various e-Government applications. Key sectors for the introduction of privacy-enhancing technologies include the health sector (communication between doctors, hospitals, insurance, and authorities) and other public authorities handling sensitive private information (tax, employment, social services, etc.).

#### 12.4 TREND: REVIEW OF PUBLIC E-SERVICES INCLUDES PRIVACY

For several years, the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (Bedst på nettet) has conducted an annual review of selected public Internet sites/services. Currently, the review criteria include a simple check for the existence of a privacy policy on the site. With increasing awareness of privacy issues, the review is likely to evolve, evaluating the content of the policy, checking compliance, and possibly assessing the required private information against the richness and usefulness of the service.

#### 12.5 TREND: CORPORATE PRIVACY SOLUTIONS ARE ADVANCING

Large public and private organizations are increasingly taking responsibility for safeguarding the privacy of their customers and employees. Managing the identity and permissions of internal and external users is becoming an important part of corporate applications and services, and implementing a reasonable privacy policy is increasingly crucial for the image of the service provider. This indicates that user-controlled privacy technologies offered by third parties (e.g., as infrastructure services or user tools) are less likely to gain high popularity, as some PET functionality is already included in many standard services. However, for some legacy services (without PET functionality) and for users with little trust in the service provider, user-controlled PETs will remain a viable option.

#### 12.6 ISSUE: LACK OF A TRUST MODEL

One of the most significant barriers to the implementation and adoption of privacy-enhancing solutions is the lack of a clear classification of privacy vulnerabilities and threats. Unlike the loss of material assets, the value of a privacy impact depends on the situation, so a classification of information sensitivity is not sufficient. Establishing a "Privacy Trust Model" would be a valuable step toward standardizing the area of privacy. Research into a common understanding of privacy threats would be a valuable input to the design of both demonstration projects and the planning of full-scale privacy-enhancing solutions.

#### 12.7 ISSUE: SPECIFIC PROVISIONS ARE LIMITING DESIGN CHANGES

Many privacy problems with legacy systems, especially in the public sector, can be traced back to the fact that the original design was developed to comply with specific regulatory provisions that did not include a requirement for privacy protection. The owners of these legacy systems are likely to be reluctant to change the design unless a clear signal is given by legislators. This suggests a need to revise specific provisions to balance administrative efficiency with the need for privacy protection.

#### 12.8 ISSUE: NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE CHALLENGING OLD LEGISLATION

New and emerging technologies, such as advanced SIMs, smart cards, and RFID, open new possibilities for tracking individuals and their actions. However, the consequences are often unclear due to the lack of a privacy classification. Current privacy legislation (in Denmark, mainly expressed in Persondataloven) may need to be supplemented with regulations governing the rights and duties of the different parties involved in protecting privacy when new technologies are applied. New regulation in this area would benefit from additional research in the field of privacy and from following the results from other countries and international working groups, such as the PETTEP project (see Chapter 10).

#### 12.9 ISSUE: LACK OF STANDARDS

Today’s PET solutions are rarely interoperable (with the notable exceptions of P3P and EPAL, see Chapter 10), because a common understanding of the concepts and requirements has not been established. As a precursor to firm standards, it could be valuable to develop and propose best practices for the privacy protection of private and public electronic services. Building on the existing legal foundation of Persondataloven and the supplementing rules and guidelines from the Danish Data Protection Agency (Datatilsynet), a privacy practice recommendation could provide guidance and examples of appropriate privacy policies, implementation principles, and compliance evaluations. This would help builders of e-services create solutions that meet both user expectations and legal requirements for privacy.

#### 12.10 ISSUE: PRIVACY REQUIRES AN ARCHITECTURE

Most of today’s privacy-enhancing technologies are offered as add-on products that can reduce or eliminate the effects of privacy flaws in applications, infrastructure, or even business processes. The use of privacy-enhancing technologies must be carefully planned to achieve the set goals. Architecting privacy starts with establishing the privacy principles that must be met by the end-to-end solution and implementing these principles in the design of applications and/or the IT infrastructure. For this reason, it could be valuable to establish a set of architecture principles for privacy and to include privacy requirements in the enterprise architecture work currently in progress under the Danish IT architecture and software strategy.
