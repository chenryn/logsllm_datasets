operating system (e.g. Windows XP). 
In the future, privacy features are likely to be integrated in the IT infrastructure, as a part of 
the  application  platforms  (in  the  operation  system,  database  management  system  and 
development framework). This means that today’s independent PET providers are likely to 
remain  niche  players  –  or  to  be  acquired  by  major  infrastructure  suppliers,  wanting  to 
integrate the technology in their products and services.

11.5  WHERE CAN INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION HELP? 
In  Europe,  the  EU  privacy  directive  has  been  widely  implemented  in  national  legislation, 
regulating e.g. exchange of private data between public administrations. The directive builds 
on  many  earlier  sources,  such  as  the  OECD  privacy  principles,  but  it  does  not  provide  a 
comprehensive  conceptual  framework.  On  a  national  basis,  many  provisions  must  be 
coordinated, in order to be conceptually compatible, and support a common goal of privacy. 
The  most  important  challenge  is  that  no  common  concepts  have  yet  been  established  for 
describing  privacy  issues  and  solutions,  such  as  a  common  classification  of  private 
information,  or  common  descriptions  of  usage  scenarios,  representing  classes  of  privacy 
threats. 
Because a large number of electronic services are offered and used in the global information 
society, it will require close cooperation between all countries to implement a common policy 
for protecting the privacy of the citizens. In related areas, such as the fight against spam, or 
the prevention of dialler abuse, it has proven difficult to involve all governments and private 
players  in  the  implementation  of  common  controls.  Similarly,  it  is  likely  to  be  difficult  to 
create a broad consensus about a specific common privacy policy. 
International  cooperation  in  the  privacy  field  is  expected  to  be  most  useful  in  areas  of 
research and development of common terminologies and concepts for classification of private 
data,  issues  and  usage  scenarios.  The  international  sharing  of  experiences  from  concrete 
initiatives  can  also  be  of  significant  value,  but  it  must  be  recognized  that  the  privacy 
awareness  and  end  user  attitude  to  possible  solutions  can  vary  significantly  between 
countries, depending on e.g. cultural factors and IT maturity.

12  PRIVACY TRENDS AND ISSUES 
As  described  earlier  in  this  report,  a  number  of  privacy  issues  are  still  candidates  for 
additional  research  and  many  privacy  solutions  are  still  at  the  stage  of  conceptual 
development.  This  chapter  presents  a  number  of  significant  trends  and  issues,  illustrating 
possible  ways  of  gaining  a  better  understanding  of  today’s  privacy  issues  and  applying 
relevant technologies and methods to protect the privacy for users of electronic services. 
12.1    TREND: DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS 
To  improve  the  general  knowledge  and  awareness  of  privacy  issues  and  solutions, 
organizations  are  launching  demonstration  projects,  where  well  known  transactions  or 
interactions are performed without the usual identification of the user, by using alternative 
means  and  technologies  to  establish  the  necessary  link  in  the  transaction.  The  technology 
used could be biometrics, smart cards or other ID tokens. Privacy demonstration projects are 
relevant  in  many  sectors,  such  as  health  services,  shopping,  social  benefits,  investments, 
travel cards, etc. A valuable demonstration starts by analyzing and possibly redesigning the 
business model and the information flow of the transaction. Unfortunately, the results of the 
demonstrations  (with  respect  to  user  acceptance,  cost,  effort,  benefits  and  possible  side 
effects) are not always published, but rather used as an internal tool to improve the traditional 
business processes. 
12.2    TREND: ACCEPTANCE SURVEYS 
Another common initiative is to conduct surveys of the public perception of privacy issues 
and  the  value  of  privacy.  However,  it  is  our  view,  that  surveys  including  respondents  that 
have experienced the issues and tried the solutions, will be much more qualified than opinion 
polls that include a random audience. The most valuable acceptance surveys are conducted in 
combination  with  selected  demonstration  projects,  where  the  participants  have  first  hand 
experience with using PET solutions, e.g. an acceptance survey connected with implementing 
P3P technology for selected sites or services. 
12.3    TREND: PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS IN E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES  
A large number of e-Government services are currently being deployed, in order to introduce 
self-service and reduce the administrative cost. However, the services are often built as an 
electronic copy of the manual administration process. It would be of considerable value to 
introduce  privacy  protection  as  part  of  the  solution  design,  when  the  service  is  built  or 
revised. A privacy-aware design means that the user has access to a good and well-structured 
privacy policy, certainty that the service complies with the policy, an easy choice of privacy 
options – with sensible defaults – and a helpful guide  explaining the choices. The privacy 
protecting components of the design could very well be developed as common patterns, to be 
included in several different eGovernment applications. Key sectors for the introduction of 
privacy  enhancing  technologies  are  the  health  sector  (communication  between  doctors, 
hospitals,  insurance,  authorities),  and  other  public  authorities  handling  sensitive  private 
information (tax, employment, social services, etc).

12.4    TREND: REVIEW OF PUBLIC E-SERVICES INCLUDES PRIVACY 
For  several  years,  an  annual  review  of  selected  public  Internet  sites/services  has  been 
conducted by The Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Bedst på nettet). 
In it’s current form, the review criteria include a simple check of the existence of a privacy 
policy on the site. Following the increasing awareness of privacy issues, the review is likely 
to  be  developed  further,  e.g.  by  evaluating  the  contents  of  the  policy,  checking  the 
compliance of the service, and possibly evaluating the required private information against 
the richness and usefulness of the service. 
12.5    TREND: CORPORATE PRIVACY SOLUTIONS ARE ADVANCING 
Large public and private organisations are increasingly assuming responsibility for guarding 
the  privacy  of  their  customers  and  employees.  Managing  the  identity  and  permissions  of 
internal  and  external  users  is  becoming  an  important  part  of  corporate  applications  and 
services,  and  implementing  a  reasonable  privacy  policy  is  increasingly  important  for  the 
image  of  the  service  provider.  This  indicates  that  user  controlled  privacy  technologies, 
offered by third parties (e.g. as infrastructure services or user tools) are less likely to gain a 
high popularity, because some PET functionality is already included in many of the standard 
services. However, for some legacy services (without PET functionality) and for some users 
(with little trust in the service provider) the user controlled PETs will still be a viable option. 
12.6    ISSUE: LACK OF A TRUST MODEL 
One of the most important barriers for the implementation and adoption of privacy enhancing 
solutions is the lack of a clear classification of the privacy vulnerabilities and threats. Unlike 
the loss of material assets, the value of a privacy impact is depending on the situation, so a 
classification of the information sensitivity is not enough. A “Privacy Trust Model” would be 
a valuable step towards standardizing the area of privacy: The establishment of a common 
understanding of privacy threats through research would be a valuable input to the design of 
both demonstration projects and the planning of full scale privacy enhancing solutions.  
12.7    ISSUE: SPECIFIC PROVISIONS ARE LIMITING DESIGN CHANGES 
A number of privacy problems with legacy systems (especially in the public sector) can be 
traced back to the fact, that the original design has been developed to comply with specific 
regulatory  provisions,  which  are  not  including  a  requirement  for  privacy  protection.  The 
owners of the legacy systems will most likely be reluctant to change the design, unless a clear 
signal is given from the legislators. This could suggest a revision of the specific provisions, in 
order  to  balance  the  administrative  efficiency  requirements  with  the  need  for  privacy 
protection.  
12.8    ISSUE: NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE CHALLENGING OLD LEGISLATION 
New  and  emerging  technologies  e.g.  advanced  SIMs,  Smartcards  and  RFIDs  open  new 
possibilities of tracking the individual and his actions, but the perspective of consequences is 
often unclear (due to the lack of a privacy classification). The current legislation of privacy 
(in Denmark mainly expressed in Persondataloven) may need to be supplemented with some 
regulation  of  the  rights  and  duties  of  the  different  parties  involved  in  protecting  privacy, 
Page 36 
Privacy Enhancing Technologies
META Group Report v 1.1
March 28, 2005
when  new  technologies  are  applied.  However,  new  regulation  in  this  area  will  probably 
benefit from some additional research in the field of privacy – and from following the results 
from other countries and international working groups, e.g. the PETTEP project (see chapter 
10).  
12.9    ISSUE: LACK OF STANDARDS 
Today’s PET solutions are rarely interoperable (with the notable exception of P3P and EPAL, 
see chapter 10), because a common understanding of the concepts and requirements has not 
been established. However, as a predecessor to firm standards, it could be valuable to develop 
and  propose  a  Best  Practice  for  the  privacy  protection  of  private  and  public  electronic 
services. Building on the existing legal foundation of Persondataloven and the supplementing 
rules  and  guidelines  from  The  Danish  Data  Protection  Agency  (Datatilsynet),  a  privacy 
practice recommendation could provide guidance and examples of e.g.  appropriate privacy 
policies, implementation principles and compliance evaluations that would help builders of e-
services create solutions that fulfil both the user expectations and the legal requirements for 
privacy. 
12.10   ISSUE: PRIVACY REQUIRES AN ARCHITECTURE  
Most of the privacy enhancing technologies of today are offered as add-on products that can 
reduce or  eliminate the  effect of privacy  flaws in the applications, in the infrastructure, or 
even in the business processes. The use of privacy enhancing technologies must be carefully 
planned, in order to achieve the set goals. Architecting privacy starts with establishing the 
privacy  principles  that  must  be  met  by  the  end-to-end  solution,  and  implementing  these 
principles in the design of applications and/or the IT infrastructure. For this reason, it could 
be valuable to establish a set of architecture principles for privacy, and to include the privacy 
requirements  in  the  enterprise  architecture  work  currently  in  progress  under  the  Danish  it 
architecture and software strategy.

PRIVACY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES IN EUROPE - QUESTIONNAIRE 
This questionnaire serves as a guideline for about a dozen ‘thought leader interviews’. META Group 
uses this method to gain a thorough understanding of a market with a restricted number of interviews. 
Selected privacy practitioners from government, enterprise and consumer organizations are asked to 
give their opinion on Privacy Enhancing Technologies, representing their respective organizations.  
This META Group study has been commissioned by the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and 
Innovation. The interviews target thought leaders in Denmark, the UK, Germany and at EU level. The 
interviews are conducted throughout June and July 2004, the report will be published in August 2004. 
The names of all quoted respondents or of their organization will be made available to the Ministry. 
This  questionnaire  is  sent  to  interviewees  by  email,  to  allow  time  for  preparation.  The  interview  is 
conducted over the phone by a META Group representative and should not last more than an hour.
