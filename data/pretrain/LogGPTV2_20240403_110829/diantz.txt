  - **Description:** Specifies a file containing `diantz` directives. Multiple directive files can be specified by repeating the `/f` parameter.
  
- **/l <destination_directory>**
  - **Description:** Specifies the location where the compressed file will be placed. If omitted, the current directory is used as the destination.
