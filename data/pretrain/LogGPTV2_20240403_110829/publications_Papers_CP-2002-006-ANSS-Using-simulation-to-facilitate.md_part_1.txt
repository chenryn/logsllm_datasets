**Abstract:**
The success of Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) has been limited due to the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world processes. To support realistic business, engineering, and scientific processes, WfMS need to adapt to changes. Detecting the need for change and deciding what changes to implement are challenging tasks. Simulation analysis plays a crucial role in this process by allowing the tuning of quality-of-service metrics and exploring "what-if" scenarios. Before a change is made, its potential effects can be explored through simulation. To facilitate rapid feedback, the workflow system (METEOR) and the simulation system (JSIM) must interoperate. Specifically, workflow specification documents need to be translated into simulation model specifications so that the new model can be executed and animated on-the-fly. Modern web technologies (e.g., XML, DTD, XSLT) make this relatively straightforward. The utility of using simulation in adapting workflows is illustrated with an example from a genome workflow.

Our next step is to make OrbWork more adaptive, making it easier to implement changes. Adaptation is necessary because real-world processes change, and if the workflow does not keep up with these changes, its value diminishes. If the WfMS does not support adaptation, keeping the workflow current becomes very difficult. Therefore, our most recent research direction is to add adaptive capabilities to OrbWork. Currently, detecting the need for change and determining the type of change to be made is purely up to the human managing the workflow. These capabilities need to be at least partially automated, so that adaptation can be done in a computer-aided fashion and, eventually, fully automated.

**1. Introduction**
Workflow management systems (WfMS) are used to automate and support real-world processes in organizations (Sheth and Rusinkiewicz, 1993; Georgakopoulos et al., 1995; Krishnamurthy and Sheth, 1995). Examples of real-world processes where workflow automation has been helpful include outpatient health care, equipment procurement, course proposal processing, and data-intensive scientific experimentation. A workflow can be represented as a directed graph (digraph) consisting of a set of tasks (nodes) interconnected with control/data flow edges (other representations, such as Petri nets, are also used).

The Large-Scale Distributed Information Systems (LSDIS) Lab at the University of Georgia has been conducting research on Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) since the mid-1990s (Sheth et al., 1996; Miller et al., 1996, 1998; Kohut et al., 1999) under the METEOR project. In our project, these capabilities involve a loosely-coupled integration between the METEOR WfMS and the JSIM simulation system (Nair et al., 1996; Miller et al., 1997, 2000). Since both systems represent models as directed graphs and use XML documents for storing designs, interoperability is facilitated.

**3. Simulation Analysis**
Because of the complexity involved in adapting workflows, simulation can be used to assess the desirability of the change. Additionally, desirability needs to be quantified, which is done by introducing Quality of Service (QoS) metrics into workflows. In our project, these capabilities involve a loosely-coupled integration between the METEOR WfMS and the JSIM simulation system. The cost and quality functions are attached to the task by the task designer. If the task was designed by modifying an existing task found in a task repository, the old model may be reused or modified.
