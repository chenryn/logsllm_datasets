Creating A Successful University Cyber Defense Organization
(Note: slide text will be mostly replaced by images during 
the presentation, this deck is designed as a handout) 
This presentation...
Will show you a five step program to: 
1. Plan! - make a goal for yourself and your university
2. Recruit! - reach out to the campus, find interested parties
3. Organize! - gather resources, don't sulk over no budget
4. Learn! - understand everyone's skills, abilities, and interests
5. Play! - compete, join a competition, start evaluating your 
skills
...And we'll give out prizes!
         So try to be involved!
Problem
● Everyone wants to be a hacker but you're not going to learn 
how to hack in "Theoretical Computer Science 101"
● Even in information assurance classes, often times the 
subject matter is so high-level that you can't really get 
anything (practical) out of it...
● You may not have enough information security knowledge 
to walk up and be a pen-tester or researcher
● You may not know enough people to make a team
Our solution!
● We compiled data about past competitions for you to use, 
learn from, and ramp up your team to compete this coming 
year!
● We compiled a detailed guide from what we've learned and 
professionals we've sought advice from!
● We modified a collaboration software solution to help 
students play, organize and participate in CTFs!
○ We recommend a hardware solution to complement
○ Plan to distribute the software as an ISO image
What's in the Data?
● What we did and what works
○ Don't reinvent the wheel... we did it for you
●  How to stop complaining about the things that are holding 
you back and start owning some n00bs!
●  Tips on how to organize, educate and motivate a team of 
lazy college kids
● A calendar of national and international CTF-style 
competitions that you and your team can compete in!
What's in the Guide?
● Chapters and lesson plans on a wide range of information 
security topics including:
○ web application security
○ source code auditing
○ reverse engineering
○ exploitation
○ cryptology
○ and more!
● A list of web tutorials videos that teach everything from 
basic information security knowledge to super 1337 hax0r 
skillz
What's in the Software?
● A customized version of a web-based collaborative real-time 
document editor (similar to google docs) that will allow you 
to collaborate with your team while it mines your progress 
and results
● Report generating scripts that convert your mined data into 
fancy documents that outline your abilities and where you 
can improve
● An organized repository of tools, software and scripts to 
ensure the most efficient use of your time
● And a ton more that won't fit on this slide!
Our Experience, is this effective?
Your Input!
● Now we need your input and your help!
● Our goal is to integrate these games into all university 
programs, with great emphasis
● We need a method and metrics to prove that competition 
and games aid in comprehension and motivation
Tell us how to do this, 
...and win some prizes!
