It is true that Python 2.7 is natively included in macOS 10.8 and above. However, it seems you recently installed Python 3.5 for your projects while working through Udacity. You discovered that the Udacity courses primarily use Python 2.7. Instead of attempting to uninstall Python 3.5 (which can be a daunting process for beginners), you decided to install Python 2.7 alongside Python 3.5 and simply use the Python 2.7 IDLE and Shell for your coursework.

In general, having both versions installed on your computer should not cause any significant issues, provided you maintain well-organized installation folders. The main consideration is the `PATH` environment variable, which determines which version of Python is used by default. To avoid potential conflicts, you may want to ensure that the `PATH` is set up correctly for the version you intend to use most frequently. 

If you need to switch between versions, you can do so by specifying the full path to the desired Python executable when running scripts or using virtual environments. Additionally, libraries are typically separate for each Python version, so you should not encounter compatibility issues with your installed packages.

To summarize, as long as you manage your `PATH` and keep your installations organized, you should be able to use both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 without running into significant problems.
