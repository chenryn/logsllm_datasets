User: Supposedly Python 2.7 is included native to OSX 10.8 and above (if I remember correctly), but I recently installed Python 3.5 to use for projects while I work through UDacity. Lo and behold, the UDacity courses seem to use 2.7 - wups! So instead of trying to uninstall 3.5 (this procedure seemed to scary for neophytes such as myself), I simply installed 2.7 in addition to the recently installed 3.5 and just run the 2.7 IDLE and Shell. Is this ok, or will I run into problems down the road?
Assistant: As long as you keep your installation folders organized, you should have no issues having both on your computer, besides one thing. The path environment variable for python will determine which version is used by default, so I would say stick to one version, or make sure to make your programs as backwards compatible as possible. I have run into this issue on Windows, since I installed Python 3.4 before 2.7, and therefore to run older code, I have to manually select the python executable. In terms of libraries, I believe that for each python version, the libraries are completely separate, so you should be good there.
