I installed the terminal from the windows app store, created a powershell tab,
ran a command.
I then wanted to copy that command text, so I highlighted it, then pressed
ctrl + c but it doesn't appear to have copied the command text. I also tried
ctrl + shift + c. Getting desperate I right clicked on the tab item itself,
looking for a menu where I could select "copy" but no such menu seems to
exist. I also tried right clicking with the text selected hoping for a menu
where I could select "copy selection" but again no such menu exists. In
desperation I gave up - copying text does not appear possible. What am I doing
wrong?
