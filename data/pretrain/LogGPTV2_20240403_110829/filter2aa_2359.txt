“Credible people have seen 
incredible things.”
—Major General John Samford
Chief of Intelligence
United States Air Force
March 1953
Governments around the world have had 
to deal with the UFO phenomenon for a 
good part of a century. How and why they 
did so is the subject of UFOs and Gov-
ernment, a history that for the ﬁ rst time 
tells the story from the perspective of the 
governments themselves. It’s a perspec-
tive that reveals a great deal about what 
we citizens have seen, and puzzled over, 
from the “outside” for so many years.
The story, which is unmasked by the 
governments’ own documents, explains 
much that is new, or at least not com-
monly known, about the seriousness with 
which the military and intelligence com-
munities approached the UFO problem 
internally. Those approaches were not 
taken lightly. In fact, they were consid-
ered matters of national security. At the 
same time, the story reveals how a sub-
ject with such apparent depth of experi-
ence and interest became treated as if it 
were a triviality. And it explains why one 
government, the United States govern-
ment, deemed it wise, and perhaps even 
necessary, to treat it so. 
Though the book focuses primarily on the 
U.S. government’s response to the UFO 
phenomenon, also included is the treat-
ment of the subject by the governments 
of Sweden, Australia, France, Spain, and 
other countries. 
“While UFOs and Government revisits an often unhappy 
history, the reading of it is far from an unhappy experience. 
The authors, eloquent, intelligent, sophisticated, and con-
scientious, provide us with the ﬁ rst credible, comprehensive 
overview of ofﬁ cial UFO history in many years… Most of 
the current volume deals with U.S. military and intelligence 
responses to the UFO phenomenon, but it also features 
richly informative chapters that expand the story across 
the international arena. If you’re looking for an example 
of a nation that dealt productively with the UFO reports 
that came its ofﬁ cial way, you will take heart in the chapter 
on the French projects… From here on, every responsible 
treatment of UFOs and government will have to cite UFOs 
and Government prominently among its sources… this is 
the real story as accurately as it can be reconstructed in 
the second decade of the new century. I expect to keep my 
copy close at hand and to return to it often. While it cannot 
be said of many books, UFO-themed or otherwise, this is 
among the essential ones. Stray from it at your peril.”  
— from the foreword by Jerome Clark
This book is the result of a team effort that called itself 
“The UFO History Group,” a collection of veteran UFO 
historians and researchers who spent more than four years 
researching, consulting, writing, and editing to present a 
work of historical scholarship on government response to 
the UFO phenomenon.
Michael Swords was the primary author of the United 
States chapters. The work was coordinated and edited by 
Robert Powell. Clas Svahn, Vicente-Juan Ballester-Olmos, 
William Chalker, and Robert Powell contributed country 
chapters. Jan Aldrich was the primary content consultant, 
with additional content consultation and writing coming 
from Barry Greenwood and Richard Thieme. Steve Purcell
