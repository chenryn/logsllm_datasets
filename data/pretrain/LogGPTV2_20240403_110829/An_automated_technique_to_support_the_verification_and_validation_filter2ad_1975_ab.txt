**Content:**

In the context of the study, some systems exhibit certain behaviors while others do not. The observed behavior can be attributed to the overall dynamic characteristics of the system. If the trace (V, ∧, →, ⊢) is too short, monotonicity may not be fully captured, and this can impact the results of the experiments.
