User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to use SSH for web application login? Is it possible to hook a web application's login to an SSH server? I'd like to have access to a web control panel hooked to an SSH user group. They could use the same password for the control panel login as they would for their normal SSH account. It doesn't need to give them SSH access- just do the username/password authentication. Ideally, it could use their SSH key to auto-login, when they visit the control panel, but I'm skeptical that that is possible.

Assistant: For a large part your question translates to: I want my web application to authenticate users against the system user database (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow  and /etc/group), just like SSH does. The jargon for the Linux system authentication layer is PAM, pluggable authentication Modules. 

The quickest is most likely to configure Apache to provide PAM support. A recipe is to run pwauth and mod_authnz_external resulting in a Apache configuration looking similar to:

DefineExternalAuth pwauth pipe /usr/sbin/pwauth

&lt;Directory /var/www/yourapp&gt;
 AuthType Basic
 AuthName "Your app requires authentication" 
 AuthBasicProvider external
 AuthExternal pwauth
 # any valid username/password is allowed access
 Require valid-user
 ## Only bob and sarah allowed
 # Require user bob sarah
 ## Only the members of the group yourappusers are granted access
 # Require group yourappusers
&lt;/Directory&gt;


In larger environments the local file based user authentication is often replaced with a central user directory, typically a LDAP directory. On the system level that is question of changing the PAM configuration after which all application that need authentication are instantly LDAP aware. 

There's a Apache LDAP module as well although typically most applications would support LDAP authentication natively, rather then relying on Apache. That also allows things like a "log off" button to work, functionality which doesn't exist with Apache auth.

SSH keys are specific to the SSH protocol and although you may find rebuilding that functionality  in a web application an interesting challenge, you should know that the commonly used rough equivalent of SSH public key authentication in web applications is to deploy SSL client certificates.
