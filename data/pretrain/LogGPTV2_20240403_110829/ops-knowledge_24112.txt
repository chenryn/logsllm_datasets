User: I cannot get jupyter running from my Command line using:
jupyter notebook

jupyter is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable
  program or batch file'

But I can get it running from pycharm (slick but with issues). When I take the kernel's IP and Port from pycharm and paste it into my browser I can get it running from there. 
I cannot use anaconda because of Arcpy, and I have dug around the jupyter files for some hints.
I'm assuming I need to add something to my path?
Assistant: For future reference: the first hurdle of starting with Python is to install it. I downloaded the Anaconda 4.4 for Windows, Python 3.6 64-bit installer.  
After sorting the first hurdle of updating the "path" Environmental Variable, and running (at the Python prompt) "import pip", all the instructions I found to install the IPython Notebook generated errors. Submitting the commands "ipython notebook" or "jupyther notebook" from the Windows Command Prompt or the Python prompt generated error messages.  
Then I found that the Anaconda installation consists of a host of applications, on of them being the "Jupyter Notebook" application accessible from the Start menu. This application launch (first a shell, then) a browser page.
The application points to a shortcut in , a directory set during the Anaconda installation. The shortcut itself refers to a few locations.
Ready for next hurdle.
