**ATT&CK ID:** T1564.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Hidden Files and Directories

Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden in order to evade detection by security mechanisms. Most operating systems include the concept of a "hidden" file to prevent regular users from inadvertently modifying critical system files. These hidden files do not appear when a user navigates the file system using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or standard command-line commands.

To view these hidden files, users must explicitly request their display. This can be done either through specific GUI prompts or by using command-line switches. For example, on Windows, the `dir /a` command can be used, while on Linux and macOS, the `ls -a` command is appropriate. By setting files and directories to hidden, adversaries can make it more difficult for both users and automated tools to detect and investigate their malicious activities.
