User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Unable to logoff, disconnect, or reset terminal server user in production environment I'm looking for some ideas on how to disconnect, logoff, or reset a user's session in a 2008 Terminal Server (unable to login as the user either as it is completely locked-up).  This is a production environment, so rebooting the server or doing something system-wide is out of the question for now.  Any Powershell tricks to help us with this?

We've tried to disconnect, log the user off and reset the session as well as killing the session's processes too, directly from the same terminal server (from the task manager, Terminal Services Manager and the Resource Monitor) with no results.

Help!



UPDATE: We ended up rebooting the server as no other attempts that we could think of worked. I'll leave this question open hoping someone might have more information about this one issue, and it's potential fixes

Assistant: What worked for me to resolve this same issue was to kill off all the processes running under the locked account from under Task Manager and then I was able to simply log off that account (from an Administrator account).  

The user was then able to log back on under the account.  

No reboot was necessary and no third party software needed to be downloaded.
