Subject: Connection Refused Error When Using TensorFlow with MNIST Dataset

Hello,

I am currently working on a neural network project using TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset. However, I have encountered an issue where my program is showing a "connection refused" error.

Here are the details of the problem:

- **Code Location:** The error occurs in the file `neuralnw1.py` at line 4.
- **Error Code:**
  ```python
  mnist = input_data.read_data_sets('MNIST_data', one_hot=True) # one-hot -> '2' = (0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0)
  ```
- **Stack Trace:**
  ```python
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/datasets/mnist.py", line 189, in read_data_sets
    SOURCE_URL + TRAIN_IMAGES)

  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/datasets/base.py", line 157, in maybe_download
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(source_url, temp_file_name)

  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 186, in urlretrieve
    with contextlib.closing(urlopen(url, data)) as fp:

  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 161, in urlopen
    return opener.open(url, data, timeout)

  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 463, in open
    response = self._open(req, data)

  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 481, in _open
    '_open', req)

  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 441, in _call_chain
    result = func(*args)

  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 1210, in http_open
    return self.do_open(http.client.HTTPConnection, req)

  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 1184, in do_open
    raise URLError(err)

  urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 111] Connection refused>
  ```

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
