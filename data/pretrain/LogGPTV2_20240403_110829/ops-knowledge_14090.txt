User: Is it possible to change environment variables of current process? 
More specifically in a python script I want to change LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that on import of a module 'x' which depends on some xyz.so, xyz.so is taken from my given path in LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
is there any other way to dynamically change path from where library is loaded?
Edit: I think I need to mention that I have already tried thing like
os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"] = mypath
os.putenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH', mypath)
but these modify the env. for spawned sub-process, not the current process, and module loading doesn't consider the new LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Edit2, so question is can we change environment or something so the library loader sees it and loads from there?
Assistant: In my experience trying to change the way the loader works for a running Python is very tricky; probably OS/version dependent; may not work.  One work-around that might help in some circumstances is to launch a sub-process that changes the environment parameter using a shell script and then launch a new Python using the shell.
