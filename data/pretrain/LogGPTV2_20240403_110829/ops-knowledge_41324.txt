User: How to use the Ansible tool to uniformly manage configuration files on different servers?
Assistant: need to point out that the main function of Ansible is to automate the deployment and management of servers, including but not limited to configuration file management. The following are the basic steps for unified management of configuration files on different servers in Ansible: 1. First, define the list of servers to be managed and their basic information, such as IP addresses, usernames, passwords, etc., in the Ansible inventory file. 2. Create a task in the Ansible playbook, and copy the configuration file to be managed to a specific directory. You can use the copy or template modules to achieve this. 3. Define the permissions, ownership, groups, and other required configuration of the configuration file in the playbook. You can use the file module to achieve this. 4. Configure Ansible vault to encrypt sensitive configuration files to ensure security. 5. For the same or similar configurations on multiple servers, you can use Ansible role to deploy and manage these configuration files in a unified manner. 6. Finally, when running the Ansible playbook, specify the list of servers to be managed, and Ansible will copy the configuration files to these servers and configure them according to the specified configuration. In short, Ansible provides a unified and automated way to manage and deploy configuration files, which can greatly simplify management and improve the consistency of system configuration.
