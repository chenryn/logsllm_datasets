tion with backbone attacks (SS7, Diameter). These protocols are often used for
interconnection and roaming of phone calls, but also of cryptographic material
such as keys. In the roaming case the remote network has to be able to fulﬁll the
same cryptographic operations as the home network. Engel [19] also presented
sole backbone attacks, but they are out of this paper’s scope.

3.1 Access Technology
2G/GSM. The original IMSI Catcher was build for GSM. Originally used
only for identifying users (tracking), later devices allowed full man-in-the-middle
attacks. GSM networks are speciﬁcally easy to impersonate, as the standard does
not require encryption nor support mutual authentication.
3G/UMTS. Recent datasheets [22] show (limited) 3G capabilities of commer-
cial available IMSI Catchers. For man-in-the-middle attacks they often down-
grade users to 2G and capture them there. Osipov and Zaitsev [35] presented
a de-facto 3G IMSI Catcher by using a reverse engineered femtocell. They also
discovered that contrary to the standard, many phones accept unauthenticated
SMS messages or time synchronization.
4G/LTE. Similar to UMTS, tracking IMSI Catchers are possible and phones
tend to ignore integrity for many messages [38].
3.2 Catching Capability
Tracking or Identiﬁcation Mode (Catch and Release). In this mode, the
IMSI Catcher is luring phones into its fake cell, reading out IMSI and IMEI
and pushing them back into the real network. For a target with known IMSI
or IMEI this method can be used to check his/her presence in vicinity (omni-
directional antenna) or position (directional antenna). When used with a direc-
tional antenna, this can also be used to (visually) correlate a person to his/her
IMSI and IMEI (see Sect. 5).
Capturing or MITM Mode (Catch and Hold). In this case the MS/UE is
held in the cell and not pushed back into the real network. There exist several
methods to decrypt, relay, and/or modify the traﬃc (see Sect. 6).
Passive Monitoring. This mode can be used e.g., after a target has been
identiﬁed. Since the attacker does not have control over the phone it can switch
to diﬀerent cells and Location/Tracking Areas anytime. It has to follow the
target across diﬀerent frequencies and cells.
3.3 Cryptographic Capabilities
On GSM an attacker can choose between several methods. The easiest one, is
to downgrade the client side and the network side to A5/0 (i.e. no encryption).
However, many networks started prohibiting clients using A5/0. This can be
problematic if legacy clients do not support any encryption. The GSM export-
grade cypher A5/2 has been broken by Goldberg et al. in 1999 [23] and phased
out by GSMA (GSM Association) by 2006 [25]. Barkham et al. presented a
The Messenger Shoots Back: Network Operator
285

(simpliﬁed)
realtime ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 [10] in 2008. However, the GSM stan-
dard cipher A5/1 is also not secure; a number on publications [10,18,26] showed
severe weaknesses and later 2 TB rainbow tables for decryption within seconds
became freely available [29]. Thus, we must assume [3], that reasonable new IMSI
Catcher are able to decrypt A5/1 and A5/2. Recently, many operators imple-
mented A5/3 – a backport of the KATSUMI based UMTS cipher – for which no
practical attacks are known. However, only newer handsets support this mode
(cf. Fig. 4), and are easily downgrade-able by a fake cell (Sect. 3.4 below).
For UMTS and LTE encryption no practical cryptanalytic attacks are known,
and mutual authentication is needed for (most) transactions. However, vulner-
abilities in the SS7/Diameter exchange between providers allow the recovery of
sessions keys [19,34] and therefore either decrypting traﬃc or impersonating a
network.
3.4 Access Technology Downgrade Capability
For UMTS and LTE a downgrade to a less secure access technology (such as
GSM) is also an option.
Jamming. A simple but brutal way is to jam the frequency band. In an attempt
to restore connection to the network, the phone will try other (potentially less
secure) access technology: e.g., jamming the UMTS band will encourage phones
286
A. Dabrowski et al.
to connect via GSM. Longer jamming sessions will show up in the operator’s
network quality metrics and allow radio technicians to pin-point the source.
Therefore, this method is only suitable for short term operations. In general, an
attacker might strive for more subtle and less detectable ways.
Spooﬁng No-Authorization for a Speciﬁc Access Technology. A BTS,
NodeB and eNodeB has the ability to deny access to a speciﬁc cell, loca-
tion/tracking area or access technology for a number of reasons (e.g., no resources
left, no subscription for a speciﬁc service, no authorization, etc.). Depending on
the error code from the network, the phone will not retry and revert to other
methods (e.g., another access technology) [8,9,24]. An error code for a perma-
nent error will be cached by the MS/UE until next reboot. 3GPP deﬁned rules
on how to allow a network operator to expel a mobile from one access technology
e.g., for LTE [9,38, c.f. reject cause #7] or 3G [24]. Therefore, a chain of track-
ing IMSI Catchers denying access and forcing a cell re-selection with another
access technology can downgrade a client step by step (Fig. 1). Once arrived at
2G/GSM without mutual authentication the attacker can capture the phone and
hold it in the fake cell.
These Location/Tracking Update Reject messages are intentionally not cov-
ered by the mutual authentication in UMTS and LTE, as a (foreign) network
must be able to reject a user that has no subscription or no roaming agreement
with the home network.
4 Design and Data Sources
For the development of our detection methods, we tested the interaction of 22
phones between an IMSI Catcher based on an USRP [20] and a mobile phone
network. After that, we ware able to retrieve log and PCAP ﬁles from the mobile
phone network’s monitoring system for analysis. Based on that we developed
detection strategies and implemented them. We tested them on real monitoring
data and counter checked them with statistics from the real network.
Based on our NDA and the secrecy of telecommunications laws we had to
work on site and where not allowed to take any actual data outside of the
building. Additionally, the limitations of the current monitoring systems only
allowed us to retrieve data based on simple queries and a speciﬁc buﬀer size.
For example, we could either retrieve data for a speciﬁc IMSI (e.g. our test SIM
card) or a speciﬁc cell for longer periods of time, or a speciﬁc transaction type
nationwide but only for a short time period (e.g. minutes), but not both.
The problem lies in the scattered transactions in mobile phone networks that
forbid a natural global view on the status of a network. Thus, state-of-the-art
mobile network monitoring put probes next to the MSCs which preselect and
extract key values out of the signaling traﬃc. This signaling traﬃc is heavily
depended on the access technology. A database cluster collects this data and
makes it available based on simple queries on the extracted features. This system
has to deal with high loads: e.g. just the Location Updates for 2G and 3G
The Messenger Shoots Back: Network Operator
287
peak at roughly 150,000 transaction per minute during daytime, whereas the 3G
transaction are more complex and consist of more packets than on 2G.
The number of returned transactions on a query is limited by a (rather small)
return buﬀer. However, data can be retrieved and reassembled to complete trans-
actions which include everything from the initial mobile request, its way through
the network instances up to the database access at the HLR and back to the
mobile. This data can be exported to text and PCAP ﬁles for further analysis.
Basically, any data extraction has to be reimplemented for each access technol-
ogy. Even if the hight level behavior (e.g. Location Updates) are quite similar,
the signaling traﬃc is completely diﬀerent on a technical level.
This setup sets limits in the ability to analyze data for complex anomalies
such as ﬁnding network areas with higher than usual non-adjacent neighbor
location updates (see Sect. 6.3). Therefore, we tested our programs and made our
statistics on data sets consisting of several thousands up to 47,000 transactions,
based on the type of transaction. With small changes in the monitoring system
(e.g. extraction and indexing of additional values by the probes) our solutions
below can work on much larger data sets or on real-time data (e.g. they can
request a much more focused selection of packets, and don’t have to ﬁlter them
themselves).
5 Tracking IMSI Catcher
A tracking (or identifying) IMSI Catcher does not hold a mobile device in the
fake cell, but drops it back into the real network immediately. For an attacker
it is advantageous to simulate a new Cell-ID as well as a new LAC as this will
always trigger an active communication (Location/Tracking Update) from the
attracted mobile device.
Simulation of a new Cell without a LAC leaves the attacker without knowl-
edge which phones are currently listening to the broadcast channel. He/she could
only page previously known subscribers (based on IMSI) to verify their existence.
Additionally, it will disturb the availability of the attracted phones for the com-
plete operating time of the IMSI Catcher.
Unless for very speciﬁc operations, for the above mentioned reasons, an
attacker will most likely choose a fake Location/Tracking Area Code (LAC) (or
one that is unused in the geographical area) so that every mobile phone attach-
ing to this cell initiates a Location/Tracking Update procedure. This informs the
attacker of every phone entering the cell, gives him/her the ability to download
identiﬁcation data and then reject the Location/Tracking Update. Depending
on the error cause used, the phone might return later (temporary error), or put
the LAC or MNC on a blacklist (permanent error). An attacker wishing to enu-
merate all phones again simply chooses another LAC. This procedure disturbs
each phone for less than a second per scan and has no major implications on
availability.

load the IMSI and IMEI since both are easily retrievable. The IMEI is also

commonly downloaded by genuine networks in order to apply the correct proto-
col (workaround) policy based on the phone model.

5.1 Detecting Phones When Reattaching to the Original Network
From the operator’s point of view, a phone leaving the network for a fake cell is
invisible. If there should be a page request in the mean time, the phone will not
receive it. However, since the phone is away for only a short period of time, it
will likely receive a retransmit of that page request.
Once the phone receives a Location Update Reject message, it has three
options (cf. Fig. 2):
1. Assume that it is still known by the network at its old location. Therefore,
no new message is needed.
2. A new Location Update Request is sent to the network using the IMSI
Catcher’s Location Area Code as origin (see also Sect. 6).
3. A new Location Update Request is sent using a dummy Location Area Code,
since the last LAC value isn’t valid.
We tested 22 diﬀerent phone models2 for their behavior after they dropped
back into the genuine network in 2G (Fig. 3). 86 % produced no Location Update
(Option 1) and 14 % generated3 a Location Update Request with a dummy
origin-LAC 0xFFFE (65534). The special values 0 and 0xFFFE are reserved
when no valid LAC is available by the MS/UE [1,7]. Additionally, on GSM
many phones also use 0× 8001 (32769).
However, these dummy LACs are no direct indicator for an IMSI Catcher
even for this minority of phones, as they are used quite regularly. In a dataset
containing all nationwide 2G Location Update Requests within one minute (day-
time) we found 9.1 % of all transactions using a dummy LAC and 11.1 % using
no LAC at all (see Fig. 5a) without any geographical pattern. The numbers for
3G (Fig. 5b) are smaller: 4 % of Location Update Requests contained a dummy
LAC (0× FFFE or 0× 0000) from the same network. 1 % contained also dummy
values for the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC).

is within the local LAC plan. 0, 0x8001, and 0xFFFE are literal (dummy) values. Other
are LACs from outside the network (e.g. international or national roaming, accepted
and rejected). No LAC describes the requests that do not provide a valid LAC or that
provide dummy Values for MNC and MCC as well (such as 0 × 00 or 0× FF)
64 % of our test phones generated a GPRS Attach 4 request within the next
two minutes, if and only if it had a data connection before and did not have
an additional WiFi connection. This is due to the fact that our test setup did
not indicate GPRS support for the fake cell. Such a GRPS Attach request is
nothing extraordinary and happens regularly (42 % of all Location Updates on
a real network contain such a header) for example if a phone drops out of WiFi
and needs an Internet connection.
18 % of this GPRS Attach messages had the No Valid TMSI available ﬂag
set. However, on a real network 4.5 % of LUR messages have this ﬂag set.
6 Capturing IMSI Catcher
An IMSI Catcher of this type holds the mobile in the cell and can therefore
man-in-the-middle any transaction, and has control over the mobile phone by
means of any network management commands (Fig. 6).
