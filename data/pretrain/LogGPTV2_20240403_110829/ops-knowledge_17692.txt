User: Anyone knows what this error is and how to fix it?
I've already tried to 
chmod -R 777 /usr/local/python2.6/dist-packages/joblib but with no luck.
Assistant: You need to change the permissions for the directory the process wants to write to. Find out what directory joblib wants to put things in and change its permissions or use a different directory with the needed permissions for this. In order to be able to give the permissions and to allow Python to write to the filesystem, it must be mounted in a way that allows writing.
