User: I'm new with python, I've been learning for a few weeks. However now I've just changed my OS and I'm now using ubuntu and I can't run any script on my terminal. 
I made sure to have the #!/usr/bin/env python
but when I go to the terminal and type, for example python test.py
the terminal shows an error message like this 

python: can't open file 'test.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory  

what do I do?
I must save the file in any specific folder to make it run on terminal?
Assistant: Sorry, Im a newbie myself and I had this issue:
./hello.py: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token "Hello World"'
./hello.py: line 1:print("Hello World")'
I added the file header for the python 'deal' as #!/usr/bin/python
Then simple executed the program with './hello.py'
