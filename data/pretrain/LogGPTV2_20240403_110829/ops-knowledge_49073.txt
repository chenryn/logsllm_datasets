Question: "Which statement best describes the purpose of public-key padding modes like OAEP in RSA encryption?"
 "A": "To extend the message to a fixed length similar to block cipher padding."
 "B": "To provide an additional layer of security by hashing the message before encryption."
 "C": "To introduce randomness into the encryption process so that the ciphertext output appears random."
 "D": "To allow for the encryption of multiple messages with the same key without increasing the risk of information leakage."
Answer: C
