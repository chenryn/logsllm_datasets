User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Email used to log in but doesn't have to be unique. Issues? I've moved onto a project where they are implementing a system whereby a user's email address can be used multiple times by different people - i.e. users can sign up as many times as they want with an email address as there's no unique constraint. The theory is that they won't have actual access to the email account so it's not a problem.

I can't think of any issues with this but something about this approach doesn't feel right. The email address is not used as a unique identifier although people log in with it but what potential issues, if any, could rise with this approach?

Edit - Resetting a password doesn't send an email, their theory is that if the user has stolen the phone, they likely have access to the email address on the phone. Instead, they need to enter security questions/answer else they need to create a new account (which is why they want to allow duplicate email addresses). My worry is that this somehow creates a new attack vector for hackers but can't figure out how and I may just be wrong.

Thanks

Assistant: I'm assuming that in the case of duplicate accounts, different passwords are used as the means of distinguishing between these accounts?

i.e. if there are two bob@example.coms, one with password foo and one with bar then the password will be checked to find out which account to log the user into.

Problems with this approach would be:


If one user with an email address sets their password to the same as another account with that email address, then there is no way to warn the user without revealing that the password matches another account.
Account lockout policies cannot identify the account to lockout because the password has not been entered incorrectly.
Using a secure password storage algorithm such as bcrypt becomes impossible because there is no unique index on which to find the salt in order to determine if you have a password match. Each matching account would have to be tested, leading to long delays on login as each password hash is attempted.
Any password guessing attack against a user account has multiple attempts to succeed from each request, aiding an attacker.
