  * VSCode Version:1.8.2
  * OS Version:ubuntu 15.10
Steps to Reproduce:
i can create multi cursors by alt-shift+(down/up) but not all the time where i
wanna place cursor is exactly under the line in sublime i can press and hold
ctrl and click to add cursor to any location but seems theres no way to do
this in vscode . is there a way to to this without hacking ctrl-d combination
by adding prefix?
