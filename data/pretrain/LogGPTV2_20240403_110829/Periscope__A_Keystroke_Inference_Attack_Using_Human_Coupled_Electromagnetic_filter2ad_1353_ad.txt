rections as the ground truth, whereas columns represent estimated
results. As discussed in Section 6, ùúÉ ‚àà [0, ùúã/2]. The figure easily
tells whether our scheme causes any confusion between classes.
The average recognition accuracy is 93.3%. We observe that most
of the errors come from adjacent directions. For example, when the
ground truth is 71‚ó¶, the chance it recognized as 62‚ó¶ is 8.5%, which
is the highest among all the cases. We also notice in Figure 19(b)
that 62‚ó¶ and 71‚ó¶ are associated with relatively lower success rate,
at 91.4% and 90.6% respectively, compared with other directions.
This is because they are separated by a small margin of 9‚ó¶.
Estimation of ùë£ùëù. It is difficult to measure user‚Äôs finger move-
ment speed directly. To approximate the ground truth, we divide
the distance between two touch points for entering a key pair by its

The distance can be readily computed from coordi-
nates of the two touches, accessible from smartphone API. Table 1
exhibits the estimation error over ùë£ùëù from three randomly selected
volunteers. We find that the error decreases as the user is asked to
enter more digit sequences in advance of the attack. Take volunteer
1 as an example, the estimation error is 5.12 cm/s with one digit
sequence and drops to 1.39 cm/s under five digit sequences. It meets
our expectation; the estimation becomes more robust to variations
introduced by an individual sample. We further evaluate in Figure
20 the impact of number of digit sequences to key pair recovery.
The recovery success rate quickly increases to 85% under three digit
sequences. Beyond that, the growth becomes incremental. To trade
between practicality and accuracy, we suggest having victims enter
three digit sequences in advance of the attack.

8.2 PIN Recovery Accuracy
We now examine the recovery performance over an entire PIN that
consists of multiple key pairs.

Impact of PIN length. In this experiment, volunteers are asked
to input PINs with lengths varying from 3 to 8 digits. Table 2 shows
the recovery success rate with top-10 candidates. As a note, our
scheme can produce a list of candidate PINs. If the list of ùêæ candidate
PINs contain the target PIN entered by the victim, then the correct
PIN is deemed among the top-ùêæ candidates. This metric reflects the
recovery accuracy and has been widely adopted in prior works. We
find that the highest success rate 71.7% is achieved for 3-digit PINs.
It decreases as PIN length grows, since successive correct inferences
of all key pairs are needed to recover the entire PIN. We find the
success rate is 43.3% with 6-digit PINs, the mostly commonly PIN
length adopted by mobile devices nowadays. Our attack does pose
a real threat to these devices.
Impact of the number of candidates. We further study how
many candidates are needed to succeed in inferring the target PIN.
In the experiments, we sort candidates generated by the HMM
model according to their probability of being the target PIN in a
descending order and select the top-ùêæ candidates to evaluate the
recovery accuracy. In Figure 21, we give the PIN inference success
rate under top-ùêæ candidates, where ùêæ ranges from 1 to 100. The
result is encouraging. It is shown that, given top-1 candidate, the
recovery accuracy is 18.3% for 6-digit PINs. That is, our attack
Figure 21: PIN recovery success rate with top-ùêæ candidates.
can correctly hit a victim‚Äôs 6-digit PIN at a probability of 18.3%
in one shot. The rate can be significantly improved if given top-
10 candidates or top-20 candidates, which corresponds to 43.3%
and 51.7%, respectively. As shown in the figure, if given top-40
candidates, the success rate reaches almost 70% for 6-digit PINs.
As a comparison, WindTalker [27], a well-cited radio signal based
inference attack, delivers a similar performance with more than 60
candidates, not to mention that WindTalker needs a large number
of labeled training data samples.
8.3 Performance Under Different Settings
Impact of victim-attacker distances. In practice, a victim device
may be placed at different distances away from the attacker. It is
thus necessary to examine the impact of this factor to the attack
accuracy. In the experiments, we set the distance from 20 cm to
95 cm. All are carried out with 6-digit PINs. As shown in Figure
22, the recovery success rate exhibits negative correlation with
the distance. This is because a longer distance leads to weaker
EM emanation receptions at the attacker. As a result, it becomes
challenging to precisely recover finger movement traces from the
EM readings. Still, the attacker can successfully disclose a target
PIN at a probability of 20% even 90 cm away from the victim with
top-10 candidates. It is worth mentioning that the victim and the
attacker reside at two sides of a wood table, a non-LoS scenario
shown in Figure 22(a). We anticipate an even higher success rate
under a LoS scenario. Besides, we only deploy one prototype in the
experiment. In practice, many of them can be used. Such settings
can potentially further enhance the performance.

Impact of victim-attacker relative direction. We also exam-
ine if the relative direction between the victim and the attacker
impacts the recovery accuracy. In the first set of experiments, we fix
their distance at 20 cm and place the attacker at different directions

Figure 23(b) shows the PIN
recovery success rate at these positions. We find that the accuracy
is almost the same for all the cases. In the second set of experiments,
the attacker‚Äôs and victim‚Äôs positions are fixed while varying the
smartphone orientation. Again, no apparent difference in recov-
ery accuracy is observed. Hence, the performance of Periscope is
independent of victim-attacker relative direction. This is not the
case for radio signal based attacks. Essentially, the attacker needs a
LoS view over the victim; otherwise, the signal variance caused by
multi-path propagation renders the signal hard to tract. In addition,
the video-based attack also imposes stringent requirement over the
recording angle. For example, Eyetell [11] experiences about 70%
accuracy degradation when the two parties have a 10‚ó¶ displacement
angle.

Impact of keyboard layouts. This part evaluates the impact of
keyboard layouts on the attack performance. Two layouts, denoted
as L1 and L2, are illustrated in Figure 24(b) and 24(c). Their key size
is the same, whereas the inter-key distance is different. Figure 24(a)
compares their PIN recovery accuracy. We notice that L1 exhibits a
higher success rate than L2. This is partly because a larger keyboard
leads to more distinct ùúÉ‚Äôs. As a result, finger movement direction
can be recognized at higher accuracy which leads to higher overall
inference accuracy.
Impact of target diversity. People may have distinct typing
behaviors during PIN inputs. Hence, it is critical to find out if
Periscope is susceptible to this factor. Table 3 shows the PIN re-
covery accuracy across seven volunteers. While each individual
exhibits a slightly different success rate, the overall performance is
relatively consistent, with the average success rate all above 40%
with top-10 candidates. It means our analytic model is capable of
handling target diversity. As discussed, most acoustic and radio
signal based attacks need to train user-specific models to accommo-
date diverse typing behaviors and is thus less practical for broad
deployment.

Impact of environmental context. We further evaluate the
attack performance in four different environments, including lab,
office, coffee shop, and university center. Figure 25 exhibits a promis-
ing performance in all the environments, no matter whether it is
quiet or noisy, static or dynamic. In contrast, most acoustic based
attacks can only succeed in quiet places, whereas radio signal based
attacks do not work with dynamic backgrounds. In fact, public
places tend to be noisy and dynamic.
Impact of different devices. To demonstrate the usability of
Periscope, we also experimented on two smartphones, an iPhone
SE2 with a 4.7-inch touchscreen and a Google Pixel phone with a 6-
inch touchscreen. Figure 26 compares their PIN recovery accuracy.
The performance is similar for both devices. It means our attack
works for a diverse set of devices as long as they are equipped with
a multi-capacitance touchscreen. We also notice that the success
rate on Google pixel is slightly higher than that on iPhone SE2.
This is attributed to the larger screen size of the former. Finger
movement traces are more distinct on a larger screen.
We choose iPhoneSE2 and GooglePixel to represent iOS and An-
droid smartphones, respectively. Periscope is effective for devices
with capacitive touchscreens regardless of their materials/types.
The screen materials/types could contribute to the finger-touchscreen
capacitance (ùê∂ùëì ). As discussed in Section 4.4, such a factor does not

8.4 Comparison with Other Schemes
In this part, we present the performance comparison with prior
keystroke inference attacks on digit PINs. For the sake of fairness,
we directly utilize the experimental results from these works. Three
schemes WindTalker [27], SpiderMon [28], and the attack proposed
by Liu et al. [30] are considered. Specifically, WindTalker measures
the fluctuations of WiFi channels caused by victim‚Äôs typing mo-
tions. SpiderMon utilizes variations of multi-path LTE signals to
infer victim‚Äôs inputs. Liu et al. [30] analyzed the motion status of
smartwatches to launch the attack.
Figure 27(a) compares their success rates of recovering 6-digit
PINs. It is observed that the performance of Periscope is similar to
WindTalker and Liu et al. with top-10 candidates, while SpiderMon
is the best. All their success rates reach 80% with top-100 candidates.
Note that all other three schemes need a training phase. Large
amounts of training samples should be collected from the target
victim in advance of the attack. To do this, Liu et al. even require the
pre-installation of malware on the victim‚Äôs smartwatch for sample
collection. These restrictions make them hardly practical in real-
world scenarios. In contrast, Periscope only requires a couple of
samples to parameterize its analytic model and is non-intrusive.

(b)

Recovery rate of 6-digit PINs. (b) Impact of attacker‚Äôs posi-
tion.
Figure 27(b) compares their performance under the impact of
victim-attacker relative direction. We find that both SpiderMon
and WindTalker experience significant performance variance by
placing the attacker in different directions with respect to the vic-
tim. In contrast, the success rate of Periscope is relatively stable
regardless of the displacement. This is because the former two ex-
tract wireless channel disturbances to monitor finger movements.
They heavily rely on LoS propagation channels as they provide
the most tractable signals. These channels can be easily blocked
by the victim‚Äôs body if positioning the attacker to the left/right of
the victim. On the other hand, as discussed in Section 4.4, the ana-
lytic model of Periscope is irrelevant of surrounding environmental
conditions. Its performance is thus independent of victim-attacker
relative direction.
The main advantage of Periscope lies in its practicality. Specif-
ically, it does not require the pre-installation of malware on the
victim‚Äôs device, nor large amounts of labeled training samples. It
is also robust to environmental dynamics. As indicated by the re-
sults above, Periscope‚Äôs accuracy performance is as good as prior
inference attacks.
9 DISCUSSIONS
9.1 Limitations and Future Work
Extending attack distance. Results in Section 8.3 show that the
PIN recovery rate with top-10 candidates drops to 20% when the
attack distance is beyond 90 cm. The threat can be more severe if
the attack can be successfully performed remotely. The primary
reason of the confined distance here is the weak signal strength
of EM leakage. Besides, the EM field decays quickly over distance.
Note that our prototype is built with simple electronic pieces, in-
cluding an Arduino nano board and a conductive wire. Neither
advanced transceiver module nor sophisticated signal processing
unit is utilized. As our future work, we plan to build a more power-
ful prototype with dedicated components that can pick up useful
signals from noisy and weak EM measurements so as to extend
attack distance.
Recognizing letters. Our discussion has been focused on soft
numeric keyboards. We plan to extend Periscope to recognize let-
ter inputs. The challenge is to distinguish subtle EM emanations
from more diverse combinations of key pairs, as the number of
keys will almost be tripled. We propose to employ multiple eaves-
droppers and explore their collaboration to launch attacks. Sensor
fusion techniques [15, 33] will be applied. It combines EM readings
from disparate sources such that the resulting information has less
ambiguity than would be possible when these sources were used
individually. It is expected that the aggregated EM measurement
will provide more fine-granular recognition of finger movements.
