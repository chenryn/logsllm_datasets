### 8.1 Direction Recognition Accuracy

The ground truth directions are represented in the rows, while the estimated results are in the columns. As discussed in Section 6, \(\theta \in [0, \pi/2]\). The figure clearly indicates whether our scheme causes any confusion between classes. The average recognition accuracy is 93.3%. Most errors occur between adjacent directions. For instance, when the ground truth is 71°, there is an 8.5% chance it will be recognized as 62°, which is the highest among all cases. In Figure 19(b), we observe that 62° and 71° have relatively lower success rates of 91.4% and 90.6%, respectively, compared to other directions. This is due to the small margin of 9° separating them.

### 8.2 Estimation of \(v_p\)

Directly measuring a user’s finger movement speed is challenging. To approximate the ground truth, we divide the distance between two touch points for entering a key pair by the time duration. The distance can be easily computed from the coordinates of the two touches, accessible via smartphone APIs. Table 1 shows the estimation error of \(v_p\) for three randomly selected volunteers. We find that the error decreases as more digit sequences are entered. For example, Volunteer 1 has an estimation error of 5.12 cm/s with one digit sequence, which drops to 1.39 cm/s with five digit sequences. This aligns with our expectation; the estimation becomes more robust to individual variations. Figure 20 further evaluates the impact of the number of digit sequences on key pair recovery. The recovery success rate quickly increases to 85% with three digit sequences, after which the growth is incremental. Balancing practicality and accuracy, we recommend having victims enter three digit sequences before the attack.

| No. of Seq. | V 1 (cm/s) | V 2 (cm/s) | V 3 (cm/s) |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1           | 5.12       | 4.43       | 3.24       |
| 2           | 2.72       | 3.0        | 2.16       |
| 3           | 1.96       | 2.46       | 1.74       |
| 4           | 1.49       | 2.27       | 1.25       |
| 5           | 1.39       | 1.97       | 0.82       |

### 8.3 PIN Recovery Accuracy

We now examine the recovery performance for entire PINs consisting of multiple key pairs.

| PIN length | Success rate |
|------------|--------------|
| 3-digit    | 71.7%        |
| 4-digit    | 61.7%        |
| 6-digit    | 43.3%        |
| 8-digit    | 35%          |

**Table 2: PIN recovery success rate with top-10 candidates.**

**Impact of PIN Length:** Volunteers were asked to input PINs with lengths ranging from 3 to 8 digits. Table 2 shows the recovery success rate with the top-10 candidates. Our scheme can produce a list of candidate PINs. If the list of \(K\) candidate PINs contains the target PIN, then the correct PIN is deemed among the top-\(K\) candidates. The highest success rate of 71.7% is achieved for 3-digit PINs, decreasing as the PIN length increases. The success rate for 6-digit PINs, the most common length for mobile devices, is 43.3%.

**Impact of the Number of Candidates:** We further study the number of candidates needed to infer the target PIN. In the experiments, we sort the candidates generated by the HMM model according to their probability of being the target PIN in descending order and select the top-\(K\) candidates to evaluate the recovery accuracy. Figure 21 shows the PIN inference success rate under top-\(K\) candidates, where \(K\) ranges from 1 to 100. Given the top-1 candidate, the recovery accuracy for 6-digit PINs is 18.3%. The rate significantly improves with top-10 or top-20 candidates, reaching 43.3% and 51.7%, respectively. With top-40 candidates, the success rate reaches almost 70% for 6-digit PINs. WindTalker, a well-cited radio signal-based inference attack, achieves similar performance with more than 60 candidates and requires a large amount of labeled training data.

**Figure 21: PIN recovery success rate with top-\(K\) candidates.**

### 8.4 Performance Under Different Settings

**Impact of Victim-Attacker Distances:** In practice, the victim device may be placed at different distances from the attacker. We examined the impact of this factor on attack accuracy by setting the distance from 20 cm to 95 cm. All experiments were conducted with 6-digit PINs. Figure 22 shows that the recovery success rate negatively correlates with the distance. A longer distance leads to weaker EM emanation receptions, making it challenging to recover finger movement traces. However, the attacker can still disclose a target PIN with a 20% success rate at 90 cm with top-10 candidates. Notably, the victim and the attacker were on opposite sides of a wooden table, a non-LoS scenario. We anticipate higher success rates in LoS scenarios and with multiple prototypes.

**Figure 22: Impact of victim-attacker distance. (a) Positions of the victim and the attacker. (b) PIN recovery success rate.**

**Impact of Victim-Attacker Relative Direction:** We also examined the impact of the relative direction between the victim and the attacker on recovery accuracy. In the first set of experiments, we fixed the distance at 20 cm and placed the attacker at different directions relative to the victim, as shown in Figure 23(a). Figure 23(b) shows the PIN recovery success rate at these positions. The accuracy was nearly the same in all cases. In the second set of experiments, the attacker's and victim's positions were fixed while varying the smartphone orientation. Again, no significant difference in recovery accuracy was observed. Thus, Periscope's performance is independent of the relative direction, unlike radio signal-based attacks, which require a LoS view.

**Figure 23: Impact of victim-attacker relative direction. (a) Test scenarios for the first set of experiments. (b) PIN recovery success rate. (c) Test scenarios for the second set of experiments. (d) PIN recovery success rate.**

**Impact of Keyboard Layouts:** We evaluated the impact of keyboard layouts on attack performance. Two layouts, denoted as L1 and L2, are illustrated in Figure 24(b) and 24(c). Their key sizes are the same, but the inter-key distances differ. Figure 24(a) compares their PIN recovery accuracy. L1 exhibits a higher success rate than L2, partly because a larger keyboard leads to more distinct \(\theta\) values, improving the overall inference accuracy.

**Figure 24: Impact of keyboard layouts. (a) PIN recovery success rate. (b) Layout 1. (c) Layout 2.**

**Impact of Target Diversity:** People may have distinct typing behaviors during PIN inputs. Table 3 shows the PIN recovery accuracy across seven volunteers. While each individual exhibited slightly different success rates, the overall performance was consistent, with the average success rate above 40% with top-10 candidates. This indicates that our analytic model can handle target diversity, unlike acoustic and radio signal-based attacks, which require user-specific models.

| Index | Top-10 | Top-40 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1     | 52.7%  | 68.9%  |
| 2     | 46.7%  | 72.1%  |
| 3     | 42.5%  | 69.5%  |
| 4     | 50.1%  | 74.1%  |
| 5     | 40.2%  | 63.4%  |
| 6     | 40.6%  | 67.8%  |
| 7     | 45.6%  | 62.2%  |

**Table 3: PIN recovery success rate over different victims.**

**Figure 25: Impact of environmental context.**

**Impact of Environmental Context:** We evaluated the attack performance in four different environments: lab, office, coffee shop, and university center. Figure 25 shows promising performance in all environments, regardless of noise and dynamics. Acoustic-based attacks typically succeed only in quiet places, while radio signal-based attacks fail in dynamic backgrounds. Public places tend to be noisy and dynamic.

**Figure 26: Impact of device diversity.**

**Impact of Different Devices:** To demonstrate Periscope's usability, we experimented with two smartphones: an iPhone SE2 with a 4.7-inch touchscreen and a Google Pixel phone with a 6-inch touchscreen. Figure 26 compares their PIN recovery accuracy. The performance was similar for both devices, indicating that our attack works for a diverse set of devices with multi-capacitance touchscreens. The success rate on the Google Pixel was slightly higher, attributed to its larger screen size, which makes finger movement traces more distinct.

### 8.5 Comparison with Other Schemes

We compared Periscope's performance with prior keystroke inference attacks on digit PINs, including WindTalker [27], SpiderMon [28], and the attack proposed by Liu et al. [30]. WindTalker measures WiFi channel fluctuations caused by typing motions, SpiderMon uses multi-path LTE signals, and Liu et al. analyze smartwatch motion status.

**Figure 27(a)** compares their success rates in recovering 6-digit PINs. Periscope's performance is similar to WindTalker and Liu et al. with top-10 candidates, while SpiderMon performs the best. All schemes reach 80% success with top-100 candidates. However, the other schemes require a training phase with large amounts of labeled training samples, and Liu et al. even require malware pre-installation on the victim’s smartwatch. Periscope, in contrast, only requires a few samples to parameterize its analytic model and is non-intrusive.

**Figure 27(b)** compares their performance under the impact of victim-attacker relative direction. Both SpiderMon and WindTalker experience significant performance variance when the attacker is placed in different directions relative to the victim. Periscope's success rate remains stable, as it does not rely on LoS propagation channels and is unaffected by surrounding environmental conditions.

### 9. Discussions

#### 9.1 Limitations and Future Work

**Extending Attack Distance:** Results in Section 8.3 show that the PIN recovery rate with top-10 candidates drops to 20% beyond 90 cm. The primary reason is the weak signal strength of EM leakage, which decays quickly over distance. Our prototype uses simple electronic pieces, including an Arduino nano board and a conductive wire. Future work will involve building a more powerful prototype with dedicated components to pick up useful signals from noisy and weak EM measurements, extending the attack distance.

**Recognizing Letters:** Our discussion has focused on soft numeric keyboards. We plan to extend Periscope to recognize letter inputs. The challenge is to distinguish subtle EM emanations from more diverse key pairs, as the number of keys will nearly triple. We propose using multiple eavesdroppers and sensor fusion techniques to combine EM readings from disparate sources, providing more fine-granular recognition of finger movements.

#### 9.2 Defense Solutions

Periscope exploits human-coupled EM emanations to recover victims' PINs. Potential defense solutions include:

- **EM Shielding:** Using materials that block or attenuate EM emissions.
- **Software Countermeasures:** Implementing algorithms that randomize the layout or timing of key presses.
- **User Education:** Informing users about the risks and encouraging the use of biometric authentication methods.

These defenses can help mitigate the threat posed by Periscope and similar attacks.
