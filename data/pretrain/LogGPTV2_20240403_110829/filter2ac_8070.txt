### Title: Security Vulnerabilities in the Integration and Management of Messaging Protocols on Commercial IoT Clouds

With the growing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), numerous IoT cloud platforms have emerged to facilitate device manufacturers in connecting their products to end-users and offloading communication management to cloud providers. Central to these IoT cloud services is the mechanism that mediates communication, such as control commands and messages, between IoT devices and users. This communication often relies on existing general messaging protocols, with MQTT being the most widely adopted. Major IoT cloud providers, including AWS, Microsoft, IBM, Google, Alibaba, and Tuya Smart, all utilize MQTT.

However, it remains unclear whether these protocols, which were not designed for the adversarial environment of IoT, introduce new security risks. In this presentation, we present the first systematic study on the security measures implemented by leading commercial IoT clouds (e.g., AWS IoT Core, IBM Watson IoT, Azure IoT, Google Cloud IoT, Alibaba IoT, Tuya Smart) to integrate MQTT into device-user communication. Our findings indicate that, in the absence of rigorous security analysis, the security additions (such as authentication, authorization, and session management) made by these platforms are vulnerable. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain control of devices, launch large-scale denial-of-service attacks, steal sensitive data, and falsify device status for deceptive purposes.

We successfully executed proof-of-concept (PoC) and end-to-end attacks on eight leading IoT clouds using real commercial IoT devices. A subsequent measurement study confirmed that the security impacts of our attacks are significant and widespread. We reported our findings to all affected cloud providers and device manufacturers, who acknowledged the issues (as evidenced by Microsoft's Security Researcher Acknowledgments, CVE-2018-12546, and vendor responses on our supporting site). Additionally, we reported our findings to the MQTT Technical Committee (OASIS Open Issues MQTT-536), and potential mitigations are currently under open discussion.

In conclusion, our research highlights that, without standardized guidance and robust security practices for integrating and managing general messaging protocols on IoT clouds, secure user-device interactions cannot be guaranteed in practice. The security gap between the protocol and the real-world IoT environment is often underestimated, leading to significant vulnerabilities.
