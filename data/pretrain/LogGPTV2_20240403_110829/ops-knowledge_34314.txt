### Problem Description and Environment

I am new to SQL Server administration and have recently taken over an older server that hosts the primary database for our daily operations. I need assistance in understanding and resolving a specific issue with the maintenance plan on this server.

**Issue:**
The simple maintenance plan on this server fails only when full backups do not run. The root cause appears to be that the transaction log is filling up, even though it is statically set to 40 GB. 

**Current Setup:**
- **Server Environment:**
  - SQL Server Enterprise 2005 x64 (version 9.0.3080) with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) on Windows Server 2003 R2 x64.
  - Full backups are performed on all databases from Monday to Friday.
  - The main operational database has 10-minute differential backups during production hours and uses the simple recovery model.
  - The simple maintenance plan runs every 24 hours.
  - File system details:
    - Main operational database: ~70 GB
    - Index files (4 of them): ~2 GB
    - Transaction log: 40 GB
  - Full backups: ~50 GB
  - No replication or mirroring is in place.

**Maintenance Plan Details:**
- The job type is listed as an SSIS package.
- Execution tasks include:
  - Database Integrity Check (including indexes)
  - Rebuild Indexes (default free space per page, sort results in tempdb)
  - Update Statistics (column stats only, full scan)
  - Maintenance Cleanup (delete maintenance plan text reports older than 2 weeks)
  - History Cleanup (delete backup and restore, SQL Server Agent job history, and maintenance plan history files older than 2 weeks)

### Observations and Questions

- **Transaction Log Usage:**
  - During production hours, the transaction log usage is minimal (less than 1%).
  - The log fills up significantly (up to 40%) during successful maintenance plan runs.
  - In cases of failure, the transaction log reaches its maximum capacity (40 GB).

- **Recovery Model:**
  - The current recovery model is set to simple, which is generally not recommended for production environments. It should be changed to either bulk-logged or full.

### Key Questions

1. **Why does the simple maintenance plan succeed when full backups run but fail when they do not?**
   - This behavior is unexpected based on my research. I want to understand the underlying cause rather than just increasing the log space, as that seems like a temporary fix.

2. **Is it normal for the maintenance plan to be an SSIS package?**
   - If so, how does this affect the transaction log usage?

### Additional Information Needed

- **Backup Strategy:**
  - Detailed information about the current backup strategy, including the schedule and types of backups (full, differential, log).
  - Any specific settings or configurations related to the transaction log and backup processes.

- **Error Logs:**
  - Any error messages or logs that provide more context about the failures.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Performance metrics and monitoring data for the transaction log during both successful and failed maintenance plan runs.
