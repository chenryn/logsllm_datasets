Roles would look cleaner if filenames were shortened from
`roles/foo/tasks/main.yml` to `roles/foo/tasks.yml`. Counting a directory as a
file, this would reduce the number of files inside role directories with 50%.
Moreover, file lookup in editors such as sublime text would work better,
because typing `roles/foo/tasks` is the shortest string that is guaranteed to
give the correct file as the first hit.
Of course, the old structure should still be supported too, for backward
compatibility.
