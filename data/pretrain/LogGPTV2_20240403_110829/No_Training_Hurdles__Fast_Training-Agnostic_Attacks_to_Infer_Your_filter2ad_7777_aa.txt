ABSTRACT
Traditional methods to eavesdrop keystrokes leverage some mal-
ware installed in a target computer to record the keystrokes for
an adversary. Existing research work has identified a new class of
attacks that can eavesdrop the keystrokes in a non-invasive way
without infecting the target computer to install a malware. The
common idea is that pressing a key of a keyboard can cause a unique
and subtle environmental change, which can be captured and ana-
lyzed by the eavesdropper to learn the keystrokes. For these attacks,
however, a training phase must be accomplished to establish the
relationship between an observed environmental change and the
action of pressing a specific key. This significantly limits the impact
and practicality of these attacks.
In this paper, we discover that it is possible to design keystroke
eavesdropping attacks without requiring the training phase. We
create this attack based on the channel state information extracted
from wireless signal. To eavesdrop keystrokes, we establish a map-
ping between typing each letter and its respective environmental
change by exploiting the correlation among observed changes and
known structures of dictionary words. We implement this attack on
software-defined radio platforms and conduct a suite of experiments
to validate the impact of this attack. We point out that this paper
does not propose to use wireless signal for inferring keystrokes,
since such work already exists. Instead, the main goal of this paper
is to propose new techniques to remove the training process, which
can make existing work unpractical.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sensitive information such as classified documents, trade secrets, or
private emails are typeset and input into a computer for storage or
transmission almost exclusively via a keyboard. Emerging research
work has identified a new class of attacks that can eavesdrop the
keystrokes in a non-invasive way [6, 7, 11, 12, 18, 21, 26, 28, 32, 37,
40, 42]. These new attacks eliminate the requirement to infect the
target computer with a keylogger or other malware to violate the
user’s privacy. Their common underlying principle is that pressing
a key on a keyboard causes subtle environmental impacts unique
to that key, which can be observed and correlated for all keys. For
example, an eavesdropper can set up a malicious WiFi router to
receive the wireless signal emitted by a target laptop. A user press-
ing a key causes a unique disturbance on the received signal, and
the eavesdropper can analyze these disturbances to learn which
key is pressed. In general, these non-invasive keystroke eavesdrop-
ping attacks can be classified into three categories, vibration based
attacks [21, 26], acoustic signal based attacks [7, 12, 37, 42], and
wireless signal based attacks [6, 11, 18].
These attacks also share a common weakness, that of requiring
a training phase to be at all effective. This establishes the rela-
tionships between observed environmental disturbances and spe-
cific key presses. During the attack phase, unknown disturbances
are compared with those recorded in the training phase to de-
termine which key was most likely pressed. However, the train-
ing significantly limits the impact of these attacks. Most existing
works [6, 7, 11, 18, 21, 26, 28, 32, 37, 40] assume the attacker has
some way to perform the training in a practical situation, but none
have provided technical details justifying their logistical feasibil-
ity. [12] proposes a practical way to collect keystrokes for training
by Voice-over-IP (VoIP) software (e.g., Skype), while this technique
targets the scenario when the attacker is able to talk with the target
user via VoIP calls.
Requiring training imposes a large practical hurdle for the at-
tacker - most users are in full physical control of their keyboards,
whether they are part of a laptop set in arbitrary locations or on
a roll-out keyboard tray (a common feature of desks). Anytime
Session 9B: Mobile 2 CCS’18, October 15-19, 2018, Toronto, ON, Canada1747a laptop is moved or a keyboard tray is pushed in or pulled out
slightly, any previous training efforts are invalidated. A user may
also change typing behaviors (heaviness of hand, etc.) during use
of the computer. Hence, training must be conducted frequently to
cope with all these changes. Because training requires knowledge of
what key is pressed to construct a mapping, and therefore requires
access to the system for some time, it is impossible to retrain once
the user has control of the system, and it is highly difficult to train
on systems controlled physically by the user (which are most).
In this paper, we make non-invasive keystroke eavesdropping
practical under realistic circumstances, by removing the training
requirement entirely. Not only does this make these attacks actually
possible, but it also makes them far less invasive still, because
physical access to the system is never required.
Intuitively, statistical methods provide a way to remove the train-
ing phase. Frequency analysis [16] is a typical unsupervised learn-
ing method based on the statistical observation that certain letters
normally occur with varying frequencies in a given language. In
English, the letter ‘e’ is the most often used. An input text of suf-
ficiently large size will have a distribution of letter frequencies
close to the typical distribution of English letters [3]. Since an en-
vironmental disturbance is associated with a key, by analyzing
the frequencies of observed disturbances, the attacker can possi-
bly determine the associated keys. Intuitively, the most frequently
observed disturbance is likely to be caused by typing the letter ‘e’.
However, statistical methods determine the typical distribution
of English letters by ingesting a large amount of text, while the
distribution within a small sample text may not be quite the same.
The discrepancy between sample and typical distributions is unpre-
dictable, so correlating observed environmental disturbances and
keystrokes requires collecting statistics over a long time period,
during which the environmental disturbances (e.g., wireless signal
properties) for different keystrokes must remain static as well as dis-
tinct from one another. In practice, these disturbances (especially
wireless signals) may change over the time due to environmen-
tal changes and mobility, preventing the attacker from collecting
sufficient reliable statistics for accurate keystroke inference.
We point out that this paper does not propose to use wireless
signal for keystroke inference, since existing work [6, 11, 18] has
been already proposed to infer keystrokes by using wireless signal.
All existing work requires a training process, which imposes a large
practical hurdle for the attacker. This paper aims to remove the
strong dependency of existing work on the training process to make
the keystroke inference attack a practical threat.
The challenges with using statistical methods motivate us to
develop an effective approach for non-invasive keyboard eavesdrop-
ping within a shorter time window. We analyze the self-contained
structures of words, which can be immediately observed by typ-
ing a single word, rather than probabilistic statistics among words,
which require many words to establish. In particular, we notice that
the repetition or uniqueness of characters in a word shows through
the structure of repeated or unique environmental disturbances
collected in the process of eavesdropping. For example, assume
that a user types “sense”, and accordingly the attacker observes five
environmental disturbances. The first and fourth observed distur-
bances are similar to each other, because they are caused by the
action of pressing the same key “s”. Similarly, the second and last
disturbances appear alike, because they are caused by pressing the
same key “e”. This structural information enables the attacker to
quickly identify the typed word, as only one word “sense” from
the 1,500 most frequently used words [13] matches this structure.
Thus, the search space quickly shrinks from 1,500 to only 1 word,
enabling a much faster establishment of a mapping between dis-
turbances and characters typed. This observation also requires no
prior interaction with the user’s system and thus facilitates fast and
accurate training-agnostic keyboard eavesdropping.
To exploit this observation, we must compare the correlations
among letters of words with those among observed disturbances.
This requires a self-contained feature that can quantify such corre-
lations and be compared against others. We identify and describe
herein such a feature, having three necessary characteristics. First,
it achieves high uniqueness to provide fast distinction among dif-
ferently structured words. Second, it can be extracted both from
words and sets of observed environmental disturbances, so the
two can be compared. Lastly, as more words are typed, their corre-
sponding structures can be captured and integrated with previous
information to refine and shrink the search space.
Using this feature, we create approaches to compare sets of
observed disturbances to possible candidate words. Our technique
has mechanisms to adapt to and retain high accuracy in the presence
of natural noise and sudden environmental changes, which may
cause similar disturbances to appear different or vice versa. It is
similarly able to continue inferring letters in the presence of non-
alphabetical characters such as punctuation, navigation arrows,
delete and backspace keys, etc.
Our attack analyzes disturbances in a wireless signal, which can
penetrate through obstacles, so it does not require line-of-sight
between the attacker and the victim. External wireless devices con-
trolled by the attacker are used to collect the signal disturbances,
so there is no need for exploits to install malware on the target
computer. The attack is especially suitable for the wireless sce-
nario, since the wireless channel is time-varying and it can quickly
determine the disturbance-key relationship. Within a short time
window, the attacker can apply this relationship to infer the remain-
ing keystrokes, including typed words not in the dictionary.
We implement this attack on Universal Software Radio Peripher-
als (USRPs) X300 platform. The experiment results show that for a
sample input of 150 words, the proposed attack can recognize an
average 95.3% of these words, whereas frequency analysis can only
recognize less than 2.4%. We also note that the attacker only needs
1-2 minutes to collect 50 words to identify the disturbance-key rela-
tionship that allows a word recovery rate of 94.3%. The attacker is
also able to reach a word recovery ratio of 86% in the presence of a
classification error rate as high as 20%. Furthermore, we show that
the attacker can effectively decrease the entropy of a 9-character
password from 54.8 bits to as low as 5.4 bits, vastly reducing the
maximum brute-force attempts required for breaking the key from
31.08 quadrillion to just 42.
We also emphasize while the proposed attack targets English, it
can be extended to other languages, because similar to English, the
letters of any language are correlated and combine in some ways to
form words. Thus, as long as these word structures are identified,
the proposed attack can be easily customized for a target language
to map correlations among observed disturbances to those among

English, since it is widely used.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
background information. Section 3 explains the proposed attack
and Section 4 presents experiment results. Possible defense methods
are discussed in Section 5. Sections 6 and 7 lastly describe related
work and conclude this paper.
2 PRELIMINARIES
Because wireless signals can penetrate through obstacles [4, 5, 27],
we monitor this environment for our training-agnostic attack to
remove the line-of-sight requirement. Without loss of generality,
in this paper, we choose the channel state information (CSI) to
capture the wireless signal disturbance caused by keystrokes. In
the following, we impart preliminary knowledge about CSI and the
general method used by existing work employing CSI to launch the
keystroke eavesdropping attack.
2.1 Channel State Information
As discussed earlier, finger movement can induce disturbances into
the surrounding wireless signal. The disturbances can be quantified
by the CSI measurement [15], which describes how the wireless
channel impacts the radio signal that propagates through the chan-
nel (e.g., amplitude attenuation and phase shift).
The orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) tech-
nique is widely used in modern wireless communication systems
