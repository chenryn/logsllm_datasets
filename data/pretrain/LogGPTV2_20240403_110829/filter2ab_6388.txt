**Title: Botconf 2019 - Emotet: Large-Scale WordPress Compromises**

The Emotet banking trojan has been a subject of extensive research since its initial discovery in 2014. The infection vectors and the Command & Control (C&C) architecture have been well-documented by numerous researchers. However, there has been limited investigation into the methods used to deliver payloads on compromised websites and the implementation of polymorphism. This presentation will focus specifically on these aspects, providing an in-depth analysis of how payloads are deployed on compromised WordPress sites and the techniques employed by the Emotet operators to achieve polymorphism. Additionally, the presentation will reveal new layers of the botnet's architecture, offering fresh insights into the sophisticated operations of this malware.
