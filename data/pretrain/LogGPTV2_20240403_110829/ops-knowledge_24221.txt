User: When designing a database cluster, how to implement key functions such as data backup and recovery, failover, and disaster recovery?
Assistant: 1. Data backup and recovery: In a database cluster, data backup can be performed in active/standby mode. That is, the main database is responsible for processing data modification and reading, and the backup database regularly synchronizes data from the main database and generates corresponding backup files. Once the primary database fails, the backup database can immediately take over the data and restore data through backup files. 2. Failover: In a database cluster, failover is the key to maintaining data services. Once the primary database fails, the backup database can be automatically or manually made the primary database and continue to provide data services. At this time, it is necessary to ensure that there is no data loss and access interruption during the switching process. 3. Disaster recovery: In order to ensure high availability and disaster recovery of data, cross-regional disaster recovery technology can be used in database clusters. That is, multiple backup data centers are set up in the cluster to ensure that data backup and failure recovery can be completed in multiple regions. When switching between regions, data synchronization and network delays need to be considered. To achieve the above key functions, common database cluster solutions can be used, such as Mysql Cluster, MongoDB Sharded Cluster, PostgreSQL Streaming Replication, etc., and the optimal solution needs to be selected in combination with actual business needs and resource budget.
