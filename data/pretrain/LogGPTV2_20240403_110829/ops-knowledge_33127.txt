User: I have a Scheduled Task on a WinXP SP2 machine that is set up to run a python script:
Daily
Start time: 12:03 AM
Schedule task daily: every 1 day
Start date: some time in the past
Repeat task: every 5 minutes
Until: Duration 24 hours
Basically, i want the script to run every five minutes, for ever.
My problem is the task runs sometime after 23:47 every night (presumably after 23:55) and does not run after that.  What am I doing wrong? Alternatively, is there a different method you can suggest other than using Windows scheduled tasks?
Assistant: On the first pane (labeled "Task") do you have "Run only if logged on" unchecked and "Enabled (scheduled task runs at specified time" checked?
I've run python jobs via Windows scheduled task with settings very similar to what you show.
