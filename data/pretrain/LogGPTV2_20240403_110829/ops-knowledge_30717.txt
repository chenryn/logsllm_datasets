User: I have client for web interface to long running process. I'd like to have output from that process to be displayed as it comes. Works great with urllib.urlopen(), but it doesn't have timeout parameter. On the other hand with urllib2.urlopen() the output is buffered. Is there a easy way to disable that buffer?
Assistant: A quick hack that has occurred to me is to use urllib.urlopen() with threading.Timer() to emulate timeout. But that's only quick and dirty hack.
