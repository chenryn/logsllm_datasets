User: I have a very simple setup:

from distutils.core import setup

setup(name='myscripts',
      description='my scripts',
      author='Ago',
      author_email='blah',
      version='0.1',
      packages=['myscripts']
      )

myscripts folder consists of about 10 python files. Everthing works fine if I just execute my main.py file (executable, which uses those myscripts files). Now I try to do:
python setup.py sdist
But I get:

running sdist
warning: sdist: missing required meta-data: url
reading manifest file 'MANIFEST'
creating myscripts-0.1
making hard links in myscripts-0.1...
'file1.py' not a regular file -- skipping
hard linking setup.py -> myscripts-0.1
'file2.py' not a regular file -- skipping
tar -cf dist/myscripts-0.1.tar myscripts-0.1
gzip -f9 dist/myscripts-0.1.tar
removing 'myscripts-0.1' (and everything under it)

Files file1.py and file2.py are as regular as other files. Any suggestions?
Assistant: In my case this error was caused by inadvertly running distutils with Python 2.7 instead of Python 3. The quick fix:
python3 setup.py register sdist upload
Better still, mark the script correctly:
sed -i '1i #!/usr/bin/python3' setup.py
