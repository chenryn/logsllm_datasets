Question: "Which of the following statements accurately reflect the properties and functionalities of the cryptographic primitives used in Bitcoin?"
 "A": "A cryptographic hash maps a variable-length input to a fixed-length output and is collision-resistant, meaning it is computationally infeasible to find two distinct inputs that produce identical outputs."
 "B": "A digital signature ensures confidentiality of a message by allowing only the holder of a secret signing key to reveal the message content."
 "C": "A digital signature allows anyone with the public verification key to confirm the authenticity of a message and the identity of the sender, ensuring the message has not been altered."
 "D": "Cryptographic hashes in Bitcoin serve as a proof of work, demonstrating that a significant amount of computational effort has been expended."
