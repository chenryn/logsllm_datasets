User: Please provide a complete taxonomy of virtualization technologies and a brief description of each.
Assistant: 1. Full virtualization technology Full virtualization technology allows the virtual machine to have the same hardware code as the host machine. Virtual machines can run without modification to the operating system or applications. It usually uses a Hypervisor (virtual machine monitor) to simulate hardware. KVM and VMware are common full virtualization technologies. 2. Partial virtualization technology Partial virtualization technology only simulates part of the hardware, such as network interface and storage controller. Since it cannot emulate all hardware, modifications to the operating system and applications are necessary. To improve performance, partial virtualization techniques usually require some special changes in the application. Xen and OpenVZ are common partial virtualization technologies. 3. OS-level virtualization technology OS-level virtualization technology is a lightweight virtualization technology. It allows multiple virtualized operating systems to share a single core on the same physical machine. Each virtualized operating system implementation is considered a process, running on the host operating system. Docker and LXC are common OS-level virtualization technologies. 4. Network virtualization technology Network virtualization technology enables multiple virtual networks to share network resources, such as virtualized interface cards, virtualized switches, and virtualized routers. This technique can provide better network management and resource allocation for cloud environments. Open vSwitch and NSX are common network virtualization technologies. 5. Storage virtualization technology Storage virtualization technology is a technology that virtualizes multiple storage devices into a single virtual storage device. This is useful for managing storage devices and allocating storage resources. For example, cold and hot data can be stored on different virtual devices to improve performance and flexibility. Ceph and GlusterFS are common storage virtualization technologies. 6. Application virtualization technology Application virtualization technology is a packaged application and all its dependencies together into a single executable chain. This allows the application to run on any system without complex installation or configuration. Docker and Flatpak are common application virtualization technologies. 7. Bit-based virtualization technology Bit-based virtualization technology is a technology that can isolate multiple applications from their environment and run independently. These applications can run on the same system without interfering with each other. For example, it is possible to run multiple web servers on the same system or multiple versions of different desktop environments on a single system. Distributed Partition Architecture and Solaris Zones are common bit-based virtualization techniques. 8. Emulated virtualization technology Emulated virtualization technology allows emulation of many computer hardware and operating system versions that are outdated or no longer supported. This allows older versions of these systems to be emulated and run on newer hardware and operating systems. QEMU and Bochs are common emulation virtualization technologies.
