Due to these limitations (also see Sect. 7), the following analyses describe
the DoT response times as measured by RIPE Atlas, i.e., incl. TCP/TLS hand-
shakes; observed inﬂations will only apply when initiating connections to DoT
resolvers and, thus, represent upper bounds of response times for cached records.
Overall Response Times. The distributions of the 5th percentile response
times for Do53 are shown in Fig. 3 (left). The fastest resolvers with medians of
less than 15 ms are Neustar (median 2.4 ms), local resolvers (9.3 ms), Cloudﬂare
(10.8 ms), and Google (12.6 ms). However, note that the sample size of Neustar
measurements is much lower due to its high failure rate (see Sect. 4). Public
resolvers that primarily serve clients of a speciﬁc country such as CZ.NIC (CZ,
41.2 ms) and Yandex (RU, 51.8 ms), as well as UncensoredDNS (44.9 ms) show
response times toward the higher end. The remaining resolvers have response
times in between (16–31.3 ms) over Do53.

On the other hand, response times for DoT (see Fig. 3, right) are much
higher in comparison with Do53, as expected considering the additional RTTs.
The medians for Google (129.3 ms), Cloudﬂare (131.9 ms), and local resolvers
(147 ms) are in the same range of roughly 130–150 ms, whereas Quad9 (170.4 ms)
and CleanBrowsing (227 ms) show higher response times, which indicates
response time inﬂations of 150–200 ms when compared to Do53. The median
for UncensoredDNS is an outlier at 1.06 s; coupled with its high DoT failure
rate, the measurements suggest that UncensoredDNS is less suitable as a DoT
resolver at this stage. Despite the low support of DoT by local resolvers, the
response times are comparable to (and in some cases even better than) well-
known public resolvers such as Google, Cloudﬂare, and Quad9.
Regional Comparison. Figure 4 shows response times for each resolver and
continent for Do53 (top) and DoT (bottom); each cell represents the median
value for the respective continent-resolver pair, with the sample values being the
5th percentiles of the response times from Fig. 3.
For Do53, we observe that the lowest delays are measured in EU, where the
responses arrive within 43.4 ms for all resolvers. For other continents, we see
occasionally higher response times, especially in AF, Asia (AS), OC, and SA,
where some resolvers take more than 100 ms (up to 339.2 ms) to respond to
a Do53 request. Local resolvers exhibit the lowest response times by far, with
values ranging between 7.1–12.4 ms, similar to Google (10.2–23.4 ms); again,
note that Neustar shows very low response times but is not fully compara-
ble due to its lower sample size. Overall, we observe that the performance of
well-known resolvers (Google, Quad9, Cloudﬂare) is consistent when comparing
response times between diﬀerent continents, i.e., regional diﬀerences for resolvers
are marginal, while for other resolvers (with fewer points of presence around the
globe) regional diﬀerences are higher.
Considering DoT (Fig. 4 bottom), we again ﬁnd response times to be sub-
stantially higher than their Do53 counterparts for all cells. However, diﬀerences
between the continents are much more varying compared to Do53, with the
exception of Cloudﬂare which shows the least varying median response times
(128.1–147.7 ms) across all continents. On the other hand, samples for Google
are in between 122.9–315.1 ms (showing high response times in AF and OC),
which is comparable to DoT-supported local resolvers in EU and NA (148.1 and
243.9 ms). Quad9 (114.3–622.6 ms) and CleanBrowsing (175.4–1,171.4 ms) show
higher variance across the regions; responses from UncensoredDNS even require
more than 1 s in most cases. Overall, response times for DoT are much more
varying across diﬀerent continents when compared to Do53.
Response Time Inﬂations by Individual Probes. To further investigate
the actual diﬀerence between Do53 and DoT in terms of response time, we only
consider resolvers that oﬀer both protocols in the following. We calculate the
individual deltas between Do53 and DoT for each probe-resolver tuple (i.e., the
probe’s inﬂation in response time to a speciﬁc resolver) by subtracting the 5th
Measuring DNS over TLS from the Edge
203
percentile of a probe’s DoT response times from the 5th percentile of its Do53
response times.
We ﬁnd all deltas to be negative, which means that DoT is slower than
Do53 in all cases. We observe the lowest inﬂations regarding response times
to be around 66 ms (i.e., delta of −66 ms), although the interquartile range
across all samples is [−285.6; −114.8] ms. The medians of the deltas are highly
varying across the continents (EU −145 ms, NA −164.9 ms, OC −188.4 ms,
AS −234.4 ms, SA −330.5 ms, AF −367.3 ms). Regarding resolvers, Google
(median −115.9 ms), Cloudﬂare (−121 ms),
local resolvers (−143.8 ms),
and Quad9 (−149.8 ms) show similar inﬂations in the range of roughly
120–150 ms; on the other hand, CleanBrowsing (−202.8 ms) and UncensoredDNS
(−910.3 ms) exhibit much higher response time diﬀerences between Do53 and
DoT.
Overall, while the observed overheads of DoT diﬀer depending on continent
and resolver, we still see diﬀerences of more than 100 ms for almost all samples
in favor of Do53.
Local DoT Resolvers. To further examine local resolvers, we split the mea-
surement of local resolvers with DoT support by individual resolvers. The 9 local
resolvers that support DoT are operated by larger commercial ISPs, smaller asso-
ciations that oﬀer Internet services, cloud/DNS service providers, and academic
institutions. However, note that they are only used by 13 probes (11 EU, 2 NA)
in our study; DoT is not supported by any local probe resolver in AF, AS, OC,
or SA. We ﬁnd varying DoT response times for the diﬀerent local resolvers in
the range of 66.4–383.8 ms overall. XS4ALL (an ISP from NL) shows consistent
response times (145.9–156.6 ms) for the ﬁve corresponding probes. Further, most
of the remaining local resolvers respond within 104–223.2 ms; as such, the DoT
response times of local resolvers are largely on par with those of public resolvers.
6 Related Work and Discussion
We contrast our results with those of recent studies: Deccio and Davis [8] ﬁnd
that DoT is supported by 0.15% (1.7k) of all publicly routable IPv4 resolvers,
with most of them being assigned to CleanBrowsing (among some resolvers from
Cloudﬂare, Google, and Quad9); our repetition of the experiment reveals that
this number has increased by 23.1% within nine months (see Sect. 2).
Lu et al. [26] ﬁnd a similar number of open DoT resolvers (1.5k) and measure
response times for DoT and DoH from two residential proxy networks, covering
123k vantage points in total (30k global, 85k in China). In terms of reachability,
99% of the global users in their study can reach a DoT resolver. In their example,
Cloudﬂare is reachable by 98.9% of the users due to the DoT failure rate being
1.1% only; for our results, we observe Cloudﬂare to fail in 3.0% for all DoT
measurements, whereas Google only fails in 1.3%, ultimately resulting in roughly
similar numbers in terms of reachability. However, they ﬁnd much lower failure
rates for Quad9 (0.15%, compared to our 2.7%). To contrast this with DoH, they
204
T. V. Doan et al.
ﬁnd DoH failure rates of less than 1% from their global proxy network; overall,
they observe DoH to have about equal or higher reachability than DoT.
Regarding response times, they ﬁnd median response times for DoT without
connection reuse to range between 349–1,106 ms based on location for Cloudﬂare,
Google, and Quad9 resolvers; this includes overheads for TLS session negotia-
tion, which are in the range of 77–470 ms. These response times are higher by
as much as factors of 1.75–5.5 compared to the DoT response times (Sect. 5)
of our RIPE Atlas measurements (median of all probe-resolver response time
medians at 201 ms). This indicates that the residential proxy networks add a
signiﬁcant amount of latency to the measurements, which does not reﬂect the
actual response times for home users. Nevertheless, the authors [26] ﬁnd that
connection reuse improves the average response times substantially. This sug-
gests that our measurements represent a rough upper bound for the average
DoT response times of home users.
Hounsel et al. [17] measure Do53, DoT, and DoH from ﬁve global vantage
points through Amazon EC2 instances, using Cloudﬂare, Google, and Quad9.
They compare the eﬀects of the diﬀerent DNS protocols on loading times of
webpages and take advantage of the aforementioned connection reuse. For their
DoT queries from Frankfurt (FRA), they observe most responses to return within
100 ms for Google and Cloudﬂare, although results for Quad9 are much more
varying (only around 20% within 100 ms). These numbers are much lower com-
pared to the RIPE Atlas 5th percentiles of roughly 130–150 ms that we dis-
cuss (Sect. 5), although this diﬀerence is likely related to the connection/session
reuse as well as usage of well-provisioned data centers as vantage points (rather
than home networks). Nevertheless, while DoT and DoH response times for indi-
vidual queries are higher compared to Do53, the overall page loading times are
lower when reusing the connection and session, showing that a switch from Do53
to DoT or DoH might be beneﬁcial in terms of response times already.
7 Limitations and Future Work
We restrict the set of probes to home and V3 probes exclusively; note that these
probes are deployed in 1.1k diﬀerent ASes, with the top 10 ASes (0.9%) account-
ing for roughly 27.6% of all home probes. Although there is a potential bias
toward overrepresented ASes, we decide not to normalize by ASes since network
conditions and, hence, measurements are not guaranteed to be uniform across
an AS either: Sampling “representative” probes for each AS would, therefore,
introduce another bias into the dataset and analysis.
Furthermore, we cannot directly control the caching behavior of the measured
resolvers, though the 200 selected domains are likely cached due to being highly
ranked in Alexa Toplists and repeated measurements. Regarding response times,
we further limit the analysis to the 5th percentiles for each probe. Note that
measurements over RIPE Atlas cannot be guaranteed to run simultaneously
or back-to-back due to scheduling and load balancing on the probe. Therefore,
we cannot (for instance) pair Do53 and DoT measurements for a head-to-head
Measuring DNS over TLS from the Edge
205
comparison, and instead rely on the entire distribution (reliability, Sect. 4) and
5th percentiles (response times, Sect. 5) of the measurements.
Moreover, as RIPE Atlas does not keep the TLS session alive for reuse
between diﬀerent measurements, the presented response times represent the ini-
tial delays for the ﬁrst DNS request. Thus, they estimate the upper bounds
for DoT response times which end users would experience since subsequent DNS
requests through the same TLS session do not require additional handshakes and
will have lower response times as a result. Further, applications typically resolve
multiple domains concurrently in real use cases, while measurements from RIPE
Atlas are performed sequentially.
In the future, we plan to study the impact of diﬀerent TLS versions, or the
beneﬁt of TLS session reuse, but also to study changes over time by repeating the
measurements, including measurements over IPv6. To further investigate issues
with middleboxes, traceroute measurements over UDP/53 and TCP/853 can
complement the failure analysis of DNS requests by comparison to see where
packets are dropped in the network. With the increasing adoption of DNSSEC
and larger DNS responses, DNS measurements over TCP/53 can provide fur-
ther insight about the adoption, reliability, and response times of DNS over TCP.
Lastly, DoH measurements (which are not yet possible with RIPE Atlas) from
home networks can contribute to ongoing research, as response times and relia-
bility of DoH from the edge have not been widely studied yet.
8 Conclusion
We present ﬁrst measurement results that compare Do53 and DoT w.r.t. relia-
bility and response times in the context of residential networks, based on 90M
domain lookups over both protocols from 3.2k RIPE Atlas home probes. We
