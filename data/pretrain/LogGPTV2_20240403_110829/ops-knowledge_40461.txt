User: I am trying to create a process that will upload a file to GAE to interpret it's contents (most are PDFs, so we would use something like PDF Miner), and then store it in Google Cloud Storage.
To my understanding, the problem is that file uploads are limited to both 60 seconds for it to execute, as well as a size limit of I think 10MB.  Does anyone have any ideas of how to address this issue?
Assistant: your best bet could upload to blobstore or Cloud Storage, then use Task Queue to process the file which has no time limits.
