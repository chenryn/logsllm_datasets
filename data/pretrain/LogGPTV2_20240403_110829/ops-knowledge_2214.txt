User: So apparently I have 2 Pythons (same version) installed in different folders...one is in /usr/bin/ and the other one is in /usr/local/bin but the one the shell uses when I type in python is the one in /usr/local/bin. I'd like to use the /usr/bin/ version because is the one that works with many imports I've been dealing with such as numpy,matplotlib and Tkinter. 
I've tried using pyenv but with this I cannot run Tkinter because Tkinter is installed only for the /usr/bin/ version.

Is there a safe way I can delete/uninstall one of those versions
without breaking my whole Ubuntu?
Is there a way to tell the shell to use the /usr/bin/ version of
Python?
Is there a way I can install python-tk for any envpy version?
Something like sudo apt-get install python-tk in-desired-folders or
similar?

Answer for any of those 3 questions would solve my problem, I think.
Thank you all in advice!
Assistant: You can delete the whole /usr/local directory and the system won't be affected because /usr/local is the directory defined by the user solely. When you freshly install Ubuntu  /usr/local is empty
