The context suggester is returning only one document when two documents have
the same input (the higher score, I guess). Also the payload is wrong.
1- create an index called "services" with suggest_field mapped as "completion"
with payloads
    POST services
    {
      "mappings": {
        "service": {
          "properties": {
            "name": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "suggest_field": {
              "type": "completion",
              "payloads": true,
              "context": {
                "color": {
                  "type": "category"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
2- index a document with id = 1. The input of the completion is "same_input"
with weight = 100 and payload {"url": "first_document"}
    PUT services/service/1
    {
        "name": "same_input",
        "suggest_field": {
            "input": "same_input",
            "weight": 100,
            "payload": {
              "url": "first_document"
            },
            "context": {
                "color": ["red", "yellow"]
            }
        }
    }
3- index a document with id = 2. The input of the completion is "same_input"
too with weight = 200 and payload {"url": "second_document"}
    PUT services/service/2
    {
        "name": "same_input",
        "suggest_field": {
            "input": "same_input",
            "weight": 200,
            "payload": {
              "url": "second_document"
            },
            "context": {
                "color": ["red", "green"]
            }
        }
    }
4- query for suggest using "same_input" as text
    POST services/_suggest?pretty'
    {
        "suggest" : {
            "text" : "same_input",
            "completion" : {
                "field" : "suggest_field",
                "size": 10,
                "context": {
                    "color": ["red"]
                }
            }
        }
    }
5 - the response includes only one document with the score 200, which is the
weigth of the document id = 2 but with the payload of the document of id = 1
when using context "red".
    {
       "_shards": {
          "total": 5,
          "successful": 5,
          "failed": 0
       },
       "suggest": [
          {
             "text": "same_input",

             "options": [
                {

                   "score": 200,
                   "payload": {
                      "url": "first_document"
                   }
                }
             ]
          }
       ]
