4.1.2 Enabling Dynamic Channel Capacity Feedback
While the ﬁrst solution to contend with time-varying chan-
nels requires the characterization of restricted zones for the
eavesdropper, our second idea is to cover a wide range of area
for communication security. To this end, Alice needs to ob-
tain the instantaneous channel capacities C ins
to
dynamically adjust the coding strategy. As discussed before,
Alice and Bob can always cooperate to characterize the main
channel. To facilitate the acquisition of the instantaneous
capacity of the eavesdropper’s channel, we place multiple
USRP N210-based sensors as the helper nodes to compute
and feed back C ins
to Alice. Fig. 4 depicts the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of channel capacity diﬀerences
over the transmission time of two codewords at diﬀerent lo-
cations in our indoor environment. It can be seen that, for
most of the time, the capacity diﬀerence is less than 0.3,
which is applicable in our system implementation. Our re-
sults show that given an eﬃcient wiretap code, it is suﬃcient
to measure and utilize fed-back C ins
as the input of chan-
nel coding. Similar to the worst channel case, we can also
adopt a conservative strategy to contend with the coding
eﬃciency and the dynamic changes of channel capacity. To
do so, the coding matrix corresponding to a speciﬁed capac-
ity pair (C std
) can be pre-determined, and the secure
transmission strategy works as follows: Alice transmits mes-
sages coded using the pre-determined coding matrix to Bob
if and only if both C ins
m and C ins
hold; oth-
erwise Alice does not transmit anything.

The advantage of utilizing dynamic channel capacity feed-

cations.

diﬃcult to ﬁnd the “worst case”, e.g., the worst channel ca-
pacity of the main channel Cmin
m is too bad and/or the worst
channel capacity of the eavesdropper’s channel Cmax
is too
good. In Section 6, we will implement and analyze both of
the above two solutions.
4.2 Estimating Channel Capacity for Dynamic
e
Code Selection
As described in Section 4.1.2, our second solution requires
the feedback of channel capacity updates to determine the
message transmission strategy. In general, channel estima-
tion is widely used in telecommunication systems to obtain
the channel state information for counteracting the eﬀect
of multipath fading and/or facilitating optimal allocation
of transmit power. Diﬀerent from existing telecommunica-
tion systems, the channel statistics concerned in our system
are channel capacities. In information theory, the notion of
channel capacity is deﬁned as the maximum of the mutual
information between the input and the output of the chan-
nel, where the maximization is taken with respect to the
input distribution
C = sup
pX(x)
I(X; Y),
(4)
where the supremum is taken over all possible choices of
pX(x). Note that, if the channel is a binary input and output
channel, C is measured as bits per channel use. As seen in
Eq. (2), if speciﬁc to an AWGN fading channel, the capacity
or the achievable rate can be written as
C = B log(1 + SNR)

),
where the channel bandwidth B can be normalized to one
and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio. As for this metric, C
is measured in bits per second if the logarithm is taken in
base 2.
Note that, metric (5) is a special case of metric (4). With
metric (5), we can make more use of the characteristics of
wireless channels such as dynamically allocating transmis-
sion power by using fading coeﬃcients and performing adap-
tive modulation, which will lead to a higher rate. However,
for simplicity, we don’t use metric (5) in our implementa-
tion. We leave the realization of dynamic power control and
adaptive modulation as our future work.
Since quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) leads to a
symmetric error rate, we can abstract the wireless channel
into the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Then, the in-
stantaneous bit error rate (BER) is the cross-over probabil-
ity of the BSC. Now it is easy to get metric (4) through chan-

pacity or iteration algorithms [14]. In order to obtain a more
accurate estimation, we compute the instantaneous BER
by transmitting training sequences before message transmis-
sion. Note that, our channel has been abstracted into the
BSC, and thus no more than one bit message can be trans-
mitted per channel use, causing the maximum capacity in
bits per channel use to be one, which is more convenient for
our coding design.
4.3 Achieving Practical Coding for the Wire-
tap Channel
Proposition 1 tells us that a wiretap code designed for a
speciﬁc eavesdropper’s channel can be used over any other
eavesdropper’s channel due to the stochastically-degraded
channel property. The following proposition shows that all
binary-input channels are stochastically degraded with re-
spect to binary erasure channels with certain erasure prob-
ability.
Proposition 2. ([2]) A memoryless binary-input channel
({0, 1}, pY|X,Y) is stochastically degraded with respect to
an erasure channel with erasure probability

This implies that wiretap codes designed for an eavesdrop-
per’s BEC can be used over any binary-input channel by
simply converting the channel into a stochastically-degraded
version of BEC. This proposition gives the suﬃcient con-
dition for realizing secret communications over non-BECs.
As shown in Section 6, our experimental ﬁndings indicate
that this proposition actually provides a conservative solu-
tion, and a much higher transmission rate can be achieved
by properly overestimating the capacity of eavesdropper’s
channel.
As discussed in Section 2.2, in theory the existing avail-
able wiretap codes can asymptotically guarantee both se-
crecy and an arbitrarily small probability of error at the
intended receiver. In a practical system, however, the code-
word length n cannot be arbitrarily large. Our design and
implementation restrict the codeword length n to an accept-
able range, which is suﬃcient for achieving reliability and se-
crecy. Speciﬁcally, under a practically short codeword length
n, we propose to sacriﬁce moderate amount of transmission
rate for secrecy when the main channel is noiseless (using
Type-I code) or noisy (using Type-II code). In the follow-
ing discussion, we show how to achieve our goal through
elaborate analysis.
Proposition 3. ([19]) Let an (n, n − k) code C have a gen-
erator matrix G = [a1, ..., an], where ai is the i-th column
of G. Consider an instance of the eavesdropper’s obser-
vation Z ∈ {0, 1, ?}n with µ unerased positions given by
{i : Zi (cid:54)=?} = {i1, i2, ..., iµ}. Z is secured by C iﬀ the matrix
Gµ = [ai1 , ai2 , ..., aiµ ] has rank µ.
Proposition 4. ([2]) Let H be the parity-check matrix of a
length-n LDPC code selected uniformly at random in an en-
semble whose block error probability threshold under belief-
propagation decoding for the erasure channel is ∗. Form
a submatrix H(cid:48) of H by selecting each column of H with
probability   Ce)
is called an overestimation of eavesdropper’s channel. That
is, if we obtain an eavesdropper’s channel with capacity Ce,
we overestimate it as C +

Remarks. While the overestimation of Ce reduces the in-
formation leakage, it also reduces the transmission rate si-
multaneously. Note that in this paper, the transmission rate
is discussed in the context of secrecy, i.e., the transmission
rate is the secrecy rate when the message is transmitted at
a rate lower than the secrecy capacity. The proof indicates
that we can measure the tradeoﬀ between the transmission
e − Ce in our experiments for
rate and the secrecy by ∆ = C +
Type-I wiretap code.
In our implementation, we adopt ﬁxed wiretap codes for
the worst channel case. The idea of utilizing a ﬁxed wire-
tap code (i.e., keep the generation and parity-check matrices
constant) can be considered as a conservative strategy when
382reliability of decoding cannot be fully guaranteed. In this
case, the possible decoded codeword is not unique, so we use
θ to measure the results when errorless transmissions over
the eavesdropper’s channel are not available.
Theorem 2. For Type-II wiretap code, under a ﬁxed code-
word length n, C1, C2 and C2 have code rates r1, r2 and
r2 − r1 and parity-check matrices H1, H2 and H2, respec-
tively. The information leakage L(Cn) can be reduced by
using a non-capacity-achieving code C2.
Proof. Assume that the eavesdropper’s channel has era-
sure probability e, and the main channel has erasure prob-
ability m. Then Y has nm erased bits and Z has ne erased
bits. Let θ be the equivocation loss/information entropy loss
after decoding by H2Z = 0. As n goes to inﬁnity, the leak-
age L(Cn) = n(r2 − r1 − e) + θ. If C1 is a capacity-achieving
code, then e = 1 − r1. When θ ≤ n(1 − r2), the leak-
age is zero. For a ﬁxed codeword length n, the leakage will
not be zero. We denote the leakage rate induced by a ﬁxed
codeword length n by δ(n). The leakage now increases to
n(r2 − r1 − e) + θ + nδ(n). We use a non-capacity achieving
code C2 with threshold ∗  0 and the leakage L(Cn) cannot be reduced to
approach zero.
Theorem 2 shows the information leakage can be reduced
by using a non-capacity-achieving code C2. The following
theorem shows that the strict requirement of the capacity-
achieving property for C1 can be further relaxed.
Theorem 3. For Type-II wiretap code, under a ﬁxed code-
word length n, secrecy can be guaranteed by using the non-
capacity-achieving codes C2 and C1.
Proof. Based on Theorem 2, when C1 is not a capacity-
achieving code, we have e < 1 − r1. Denote the diﬀerence
between e and 1 − r1 by µ, so e + µ = 1 − r1. Due to the
use of a ﬁxed code length n and a non-capacity-achieving
code C1, the leakage L(Cn) = n(r2 − r1 − e) + θ + nδ(n) =
n(r2 + µ− 1) + θ + nδ(n). Similar to Theorem 2, when C2 is
a non-capacity-achieving code and the diﬀerence (1 − r2) −
∗ is large enough, θ can be adjusted to make it close to
n(1 − r2 − µ) − nδ(n). So, secrecy can be achieved without
requiring C1 to be a capacity-achieving code given a ﬁxed
codeword length n.
As can be seen, for Type-II wiretap code, the diﬀerence
(1−r2)−∗ measures how much C2 is not capacity-achieving,
so we measure the tradeoﬀ between the transmission rate
and the secrecy by ∆ = (1−r2)−∗ = (1−r2)−m = Cm−r2
when ∗ = m.
Theorems 1, 2 and 3 lay the foundations for trading trans-
mission rate for secrecy (leakage reductions). In Section 6,
we show the eﬀectiveness of trade-oﬀs for achieving nearly
perfect secrecy given a ﬁxed codeword length n.
Figure 5: Control of equivocation/information en-
tropy loss θ to approach n(1− r2)− nδ(n). Here, code-
word length n = 120, the erasure probability of the
eavesdropper’s channel e = 0.75 and the threshold
∗ = 0.25.
there is no channel state information feedback. We ﬁnd
that the adoption of a ﬁxed code is equivalent to the over-
estimation of Ce. For example, if the ﬁxed code can only
be suitable for the eavesdropper’s channel with capacity less
than or equal to 0.7, then we actually overestimate Ce when
applying the code to the channel with Ce less than 0.7.
In wiretap coding approaches, capacity-achieving codes
