The Deno LSP gets confused by dynamic imports in weird ways it's easiest to
demonstrate with screenshots...

Notice that the type error is invalid (perhaps related to #11362 (comment)),
and Deno seems to incorrectly think the type is scoped to the file of the
first dynamic import later on in the function. Another weird thing is the
`file://` path Deno is displaying in the error omits the `.js` file extension.
Later in the same module, you can see that Deno incorrectly thinks each
dynamic import is actually the next dynamic import:

The last dynamic import incorrectly has no intellisense when the path is
hovered:

I've tried restarting the Deno LSP via the VS Code Deno extension command, and
it doesn't help.
