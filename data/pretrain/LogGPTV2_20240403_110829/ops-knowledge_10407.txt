User: How to troubleshoot and solve the high CPU usage of the Windows server?
Assistant: 1. Open the Task Manager to check which process is taking up high CPU resources. You can view it through the two tabs of "Process" and "Performance". 2. If a certain process occupies high CPU resources, you can try to terminate the process or restart the system to run the process again. 3. If there is no obvious process taking up high CPU resources, you can try to use Performance Monitor for more detailed analysis. 4. A security scan can be performed to check for virus or malware infections. 5. Check whether there is a system service failure or has stopped running, and the service needs to be restarted. 6. Confirm whether there are program errors or bugs, and the program needs to be repaired. 7. If none of the above methods work, a more thorough diagnosis and repair of the system may be required, and a professional Windows system administrator may be considered for assistance.
