I would like to apply a directive conditionally through something like
[class.draggable]="someBool" with '.draggable' as the selector on the
directive, but this is not supported. What then is the recommended way to
conditionally apply a directive on an existing element? Do I use an attribute
for the selector and pass in the boolean as an input (i.e. the directive is
always "active")? I'd prefer not to use ng-ifs with duplicate elements
everywhere. Is there a cleaner way to attach and detach a behavior?
