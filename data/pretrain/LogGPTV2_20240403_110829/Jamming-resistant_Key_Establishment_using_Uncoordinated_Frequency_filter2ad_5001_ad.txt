been detected. Hybrid jammers, ﬁnally, are a combina-
tion of responsive and permanent jammers that have their
output channels already enabled while they are scanning
for signals. During an ongoing transmission of a packet,
the attacker can switch the input channels at most ns :=
(tp − tp − tj)/ts times such that the transmission is de-
tected early enough to adapt the output channels and jam the
packet for a duration of tp. Hence, for a responsive-sweep

It follows that, of the introduced jam-
mer types, responsive-sweep jammers are the most power-
ful ones (Figure 9).

As illustrated in Figure 9, for all considered jammer
types the jamming probability increases with the number
of channels that the attacker can jam in parallel. Clearly,
this probability is 1 if all channels can be jammed at once
(i.e., if cj = c). However, since the attacker needs to jam
only a fraction of a packet to prevent the successful recep-
tion of the packet and because a reactive jammer actively
searches for transmissions, the attacker’s jamming proba-
bility can reach 1 even for cj < c. In the example given in
Figure 9 a responsive-sweep jammer is able to jam all pack-
ets if its transmission power allows the attacker to jam ≥ 80
channels in parallel.
Following the above analysis, we can also deduce the
probability po that a packet is (systematically) overwritten
by substituting cj with co in the expressions for pj.
5.3. Impact of the Packet Coding on the Minimum
Jamming Period
The minimum jamming period tp during which the at-
tacker has to interfere with the transmission of a packet
such that it cannot be decoded by the receiver depends on
the coding scheme applied to the packet as well as on the
type and strength of the jammer. Here, we assume that jam-
ming always causes a bit error whereas a realistic assump-
tion would be that jamming results in an error with a prob-
ability of 0.5 [13]; our presented results therefore represent
upper bounds on the attacker’s performance.
A non-responsive (i.e. static, sweep, or random) jammer
does not scan the channel for transmissions and thus does
not know when a packet starts. The attacker therefore can-
not exploit her knowledge about the used coding schemes
and bit interleaving to jam the packets more efﬁciently. For
this jammer, the minimum jamming period tp is thus deter-
mined by the number of bits that the used coding scheme
can correct. More precisely, if the coding scheme can cor-
rect t out of n bits we get tp ≥ t+1
to transmit a packet.
n tp, where tp is the time
If an attacker using a non-responsive jammer has precise
information about the start of a packet (but does not know
on which channel it is transmitted) she can leverage on this
knowledge in order to reduce the required jamming period
to a minimum. If this attacker synchronizes her jamming
burst with the transmission time of t + 1 bits of a code
word, the corresponding byte can no longer be correctly
decoded by the receiver and thus the entire packet will be
faulty. The required information about the positions of the
bits in the packet can easily be obtained as the coding and
bit interleaving schemes are publicly known. The minimum
jamming period for this jammer is therefore tp ≥ (t + 1) tb,
where tb is the time to transmit one bit. We note that obtain-
ing the starting time of a packet and synchronizing the jam-
ming bursts with the bit transmissions without sensing the
packet is difﬁcult. Even if the attacker observes the trans-
mission of one of the predecessors of a packet, variances
in the radio stack of the sender and random delays due to
the switching of the radio channel between two successive
packet transmissions complicate the prediction of the packet
starting time. Consequently, the attacker is likely to jam not
only single bits but bit groups in order to account for the
imprecision in her timing information. Finally, we note that
this jamming attack can be mitigated by randomly delaying
packet transmissions or by randomly choosing the applied
bit interleaving scheme out of a set of possible schemes.
Since de-interleaving a packet is considered to be an efﬁ-
cient operation, using more than one interleaving scheme to
chose from increases the work per packet for the receiver
only marginally but increases the required minimum jam-
ming period for the attacker (almost) proportionally to the
number of used schemes.
In the case of a responsive jammer, a packet is consid-
ered to be jammed if its transmission is detected before the
already transmitted data allows the receiver to decode the
packet. Here, tp therefore corresponds to the minimum re-
maining transmission time of a packet without which the
receiver is not able to decode the packet; that is tp ≥ t+1
n tp.
We note that with respect to a responsive jammer, send-
ing a non-encoded, shorter packet might be beneﬁcial for
the sender and receiver. Such a scheme would, however, be
vulnerable to non-responsive (proactive) jamming. There-
fore, in order to maintain resistance against non-responsive
jamming, coding and interleaving schemes need to be used.
5.4. Communication in the Presence of an Attacker
Having analyzed the capabilities of different jammer
types, we next analyze the impact of the various attacker
strategies on the throughput of our UFH transfer protocol
(see Figure 10).

is considered in the analysis of AJ. Consequently, pack-
ets must be entirely replaced (i.e., overwritten) by the at-
tacker with valid alternatives in order to be accepted. The
attacker’s ability to modify messages is therefore equal to
her overwriting capabilities which, as shown in Section 5.2,
can be expressed as the probability po with which a packet
is successfully overwritten. Hence, when the attacker ap-
plies strategy AM , the probability that a particular packet is
successfully received is

Optimal Strategy. Based on the above analysis, we state
that jamming is the best strategy for the attacker.
Theorem 1. For all attacker types (Section 5.2), the optimal
attacker’s strategy, which minimizes the throughput of the
UFH message transfer, is jamming (AJ).
Proof. By deﬁnition of pj and po, and as a consequence
of co = b PT
c = cj we have pj ≥ po and
pj ≥ cj
c . From (3), (4), and (5), we can directly de-

that NJ ≥ NI and NJ ≥ NM , which means that jam-
ming is the best strategy for an attacker that can only per-
form one single action at a time. In the general case, the
task of ﬁnding the best mixed strategy can be formulated as
an optimization problem: The function to be minimized is

pAIM J
is minimal if and only if ψ(γt, γo, γj) is minimal.
Moreover, by deﬁnition of pj and po, we have ∀γ, 0 ≤
γ ≤ c : pj|cj =γ = po|co=γ and pj|cj =γ ≥ γ
c . Hence,
ψ(γt, γo, γj) ≥ (1− pj|cj =γt)(1− pj|cj =γo)(1− pj|cj =γj )
and, because Pj < Po, it follows that pAIM J
is minimized
if γt = 0, γo = 0, and γj = bPT /Pjc; that is, if the attacker
solely jams.

The impact of the attacker’s jamming capabilities on the
performance of our UFH message transfer protocol is de-
picted in Figure 11. We observe that increasing the number
of channels c is less harmful than increasing the number
l of packets per message. Also, sending or receiving on
more than one channel signiﬁcantly reduces the number of
required transmissions.
5.5. Resource Requirements
In the case that an attacker inserts her own messages
(for instance by replaying previously recorded packets), the

gies on the probability that a packet is suc-
cessfully received by the receiver. The most
effective choice for the attacker is therefore
to use a hybrid responsive-sweep jammer
and to choose strategy AJ (jamming).
Attacker Strategy AJ. We express the jamming strength
of an attacker as the probability pj with which a packet is
successfully jammed. Following (1), the probability that a

resulting in an expected number of required packet trans-

Attacker Strategy AI. We assume that the receiver can
handle all additionally inserted messages and only consider
their impact on the throughput of the UFH message transfer;
the additional resource requirements that maliciously in-
serted messages can introduce are discussed in Section 5.5.
By deﬁnition of Pj, packets of the attacker whose corre-
sponding signal strength at the receiver is less than Pj do
not interfere with regular packets and thus do not have any
impact on their transmission. As the attacker can send on at
most cj channels with a signal strength ≥ Pj, the probabil-
ity that a particular packet is successfully received is

Attacker Strategy AM. Modifying the content of a reg-
ular packet such that it is still accepted by the receiver is
assumed to be infeasible for the considered attacker due to
the hash links (see Section 3.3). Partially modifying pack-
ets is thus an (expensive) form of jamming and its impact

number of messages that a receiver can handle in parallel
becomes a critical factor. In this context, handling a mes-
sage means to receive, assemble, and store its associated
packets as well as, in the case of the presented key estab-
lishment protocol, to verify the appended signature.
Reception and assembling. As the number of received
packets per time unit is less or equal to coordinated fre-
quency hopping, we can assume that the receiver is able to
receive all packets. Assembling a packet essentially means
computing its hash value and comparing it to potential pre-
decessors, which both can be implemented very efﬁciently
(even on computationally weak devices), and is thus also
considered to be feasible for all packets.

Storage.
In order to assess the required storage space, we
assume that, once there is no more space for new packets
left, the oldest packets (i.e., the packets with the longest
duration since their reception) will be deleted ﬁrst. Thus,
a receiver must at least be able to store all received pack-
ets between the ﬁrst and the last packet of a regular mes-
