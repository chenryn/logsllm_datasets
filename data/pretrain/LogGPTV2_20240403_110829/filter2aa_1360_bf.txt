Let's start over with another example, this time focusing on
Figure 10.07 displays the results of this URL. Facebook has provided images posted by our target, some of 
which do nor appear on his profile. Clicking "See All" opens even more images.

Assume we want to identify posts created by "zuck". We know his user number is "4", so we want to combine 
"https://facebook.com/search/posts/Pq—posts&epa=FILTERS&fikers=" with the Base64 encoding of 
"{"rp_author" {\"name\":\"author\",\"args\":\"4\"}"}". This creates the following URL.

Let's make this simpler. In a moment, I will present the most common URL queries which I have oun Y 
to my investigations. Then, 1 will present the portion of my custom Facebook tools which automates 
process. First, below is a summary of each search by section.

We can now drill down within our queries. The following URLs would identify any time our target (zuck - user 
number 4) mentions "OSINT" within a post, photo, and video. Notice how the bolded areas have changed from 
the previous queries.

If your target was the city of Chicago, user number "108659242498155", the desired URLs would be as follows 
if no year was chosen. Selecting a specific year only changes the Base64 encoding.
Social Networks: Facebook 177
https://www.facebook.com/placcs/Things-to-do-in-Chicago-Illinois/108659242498155/
The last group of numbers (108659242498155) is the user ID number.
"pagcID":" 105930651606"
Pepsi's page (pepsiUS) included the following.
"pageID":"56381779049"
Event profile numbers can be found by searching "eventID".
Group profile numbers can be found by searching "groupID".

VvTiile I always prefer manual extraction from the source code of my target Facebook profile, the Facebook ID 
tools previously presented should also identify profile numbers of business, event, and group pages.

All of these queries will be easily created using our custom Facebook search tool in a moment, including filtration 
by dates for full profile analysis. As a reminder, I obtained the user ID number for the profile of "zuck" by 
searching the source code of the profile for "userID". However, location profiles do not possess this data. 
Fortunately, the user ID for cities is within the URL. When I searched for "City of Chicago" on Facebook, I 
clicked "Places" category and selected the official City of Chicago profile which possessed the following URL.
It is extremely important to note that I did not discover this Base64 conversion technique. The online researcher 
NEMEC (https://twitter.com/djnemec) was the first to post about this method. Practically every online search 
tool generating these types of URLs, including mine, is due to the work of this person. I send many "thanks" on 
behalf of the entire OSINT community for this work.

Business pages, such as those associated with Harvard, Pepsi, and others, do not present this data within the 
URL Instead, we must search within the source code for "pagelD" (including the quotes). When searching this 
within the source code for the Harvard page, I observed the following.

If you have not already skipped to the next chapter after all of this confusion, it is now time to simplify the 
process. Finally, let's use the custom Facebook search tool to replicate all of this work. This interactive document 
is included within the "Tools" you previously downloaded. Figures 10.09, and 10.10 display the current version 
of the tool. The following pages walk you through each section with real examples.
The first input box in the "Facebook Profile Data" section allows you to enter a Facebook username, such as 
z.uck, and the tool will populate that data within all of the search options in that section. This makes it easy to 
begin your queries. You can then use the submit buttons to search each entry, such as Timeline or Photos. Note 
there is no "Submit All" option here. This is due to Facebook's scrutiny into accounts which automate any 
queries. Submitting too many requests simultaneously will result in a suspended account.
The "Base64 Conversion Queries" section presents the true power behind this tool. /Ml of the technical search 
techniques presented within the previous pages are replicated here without the need to do any of the work. 
Instead of summarizing this section, let's run through a demonstration of each option.
The next section tided "Facebook Search Data" allows you to replicate the instruction on keyword searches 
throughout all twelve sections of Facebook, such as Posts, Photos, and Pages. This presents immediate results 
without relying on Facebook to present your desired data from a generic keyword search.
