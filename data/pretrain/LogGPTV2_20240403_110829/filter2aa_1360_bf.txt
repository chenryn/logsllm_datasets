### The Facebook Domain and Search Queries

#### Overview
This section explains how to use the Facebook domain for advanced search queries. It covers searching for specific types of content, such as photos, videos, and posts, and how to filter these results by various criteria, including user, location, and date.

#### Basic Search Query Structure
A typical Facebook search query is structured as follows:
- **Instructs Facebook to conduct a search**: The base URL is `https://www.facebook.com/search/`.
- **Specifies the type of information desired**: This can be `photos`, `videos`, or `posts`.
- **Searches for specific content**: The `q` parameter is used to specify the type of content (e.g., `q=photos`).
- **Finishes the URL with a filter demand**: Additional parameters, such as `epa` and `filters`, are used to apply specific filters.

#### Example: Searching for Photos
To search for photos posted by a specific user, you can use the following URL structure:
```
https://www.facebook.com/search/photos/?q=photos&epa=FILTERS&filters=eyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJhdXRob3JcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIjRcIn0ifQ
```
- **`q=photos`**: Specifies that we are searching for photos.
- **`epa=FILTERS`**: Indicates that filters are being applied.
- **`filters`**: Contains the Base64-encoded JSON object that specifies the author (user ID).

#### Example: Searching for Posts by User
If you want to identify posts created by a user with a known user number (e.g., "zuck" with user number 4), you can use the following URL:
```
https://www.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=posts&epa=FILTERS&filters=eyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJhdXRob3JcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIjRcIn0ifQ
```
- **`q=posts`**: Specifies that we are searching for posts.
- **`epa=FILTERS`**: Indicates that filters are being applied.
- **`filters`**: Contains the Base64-encoded JSON object that specifies the author (user ID).

#### Advanced Search Filters
You can further refine your searches using additional filters, such as:
- **Posts by a specific user on any page (filtered by year)**
- **Photos by a specific user on any page (filtered by year)**
- **Videos by a specific user on any page (filtered by year)**
- **Posts submitted from a specific location (filtered by year)**
- **Photos submitted from a specific location (filtered by year)**
- **Videos submitted from a specific location (filtered by year)**
- **Posts matching a search term (filtered by year)**
- **Photos matching a search term (filtered by year)**
- **Videos matching a search term (filtered by year)**
- **Current and upcoming events by location (city or ZIP code)**
- **Profiles associated with employees of a specific business**
- **Profiles associated with residents of a specific city**
- **Profiles associated with students of a specific school**
- **Common profiles which are friends with two targets**
- **Posts by keyword (filtered by date range)**
- **Photos by keyword (filtered by date range)**
- **Videos by keyword (filtered by date range)**

#### Example URLs
- **Posts by User/Year**:
  ```
  https://www.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=posts&epa=FILTERS&filters=eyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJhdXRob3JcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIjRcIn0ifQ
  ```
- **Photos by User/Year**:
  ```
  https://www.facebook.com/search/photos/?q=photos&epa=FILTERS&filters=eyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJhdXRob3JcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIjRcIn0ifQ
  ```
- **Videos by User/Year**:
  ```
  https://www.facebook.com/search/videos/?q=videos&epa=FILTERS&filters=eyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJhdXRob3JcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIjRcIn0ifQ
  ```

#### Custom Facebook Search Tool
The custom Facebook search tool simplifies the process of creating these complex search queries. It includes features such as:
- **Facebook Profile Data**: Enter a Facebook username to populate data within all search options.
- **Base64 Conversion Queries**: Automates the creation of technical search queries without manual encoding.
- **Facebook Search Data**: Allows keyword searches across different sections of Facebook, such as Posts, Photos, and Pages.

#### Using the Tool
1. **Enter a Facebook Username**: In the "Facebook Profile Data" section, enter a username like "zuck".
2. **Populate Data**: The tool will automatically populate the data within all search options.
3. **Submit Searches**: Use the submit buttons to search each entry, such as Timeline or Photos.

#### Important Notes
- **Avoid Automation**: Submitting too many requests simultaneously can result in a suspended account.
- **Base64 Conversion Technique**: This technique was first discovered by online researcher NEMEC (https://twitter.com/djnemec). Many online search tools, including this one, are based on their work.

By following these steps and using the custom Facebook search tool, you can efficiently perform advanced searches on Facebook.
