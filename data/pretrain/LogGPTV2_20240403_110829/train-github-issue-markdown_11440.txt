Here we have;
    PUT /_template/template_1
    {
      "template": "te*",
      "settings": {
        "number_of_shards": 1
      }
As you can see we reference the term **template** 3 times in 3 lines, which is
pretty loaded - even if the second (`template_1`) is an example name of a
template.
I was speaking to a new user the other day and they mentioned that the second
reference to **template** isn't immediately obvious that it applies to the
index name/pattern that this template should match.
I thought I'd raise this issue to see if perhaps we can rename it to
`match_pattern`, or `index_pattern` or something else that is a little more
descriptive.
