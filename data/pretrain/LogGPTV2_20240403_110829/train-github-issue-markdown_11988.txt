### Problem
`cli.py:shell_command` (flask shell) creates a context and passes it to
`code.interact`  
This leaves tab completion broken:
    >>> stuff = 5
    >>> stuTABTABTABTAB >> import readline
    >>> import rlcompleter
    >>> readline.set_completer(rlcompleter.Completer(globals()).complete)
    >>> stuTAB <- stuff! yay!
Or perhaps `flask/__main__.py` could be used as the context:
_file: flask/cli.py_
    ...
    def shell_command():
    ...
        import __main__
        ctx = __main__.__dict__
    ...
