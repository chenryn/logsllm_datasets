User: Please explain to me what is Network Load Balancing?
Assistant: Network load balancing is a technology that distributes network traffic to multiple servers or computers so that each server or computer can efficiently handle requests and loads. A load balancer is used to monitor the load level and utilization of servers and distribute more requests to the least used servers when necessary. By using network load balancing technology, server reliability, performance, and fault tolerance can be improved while preventing single points of failure.
