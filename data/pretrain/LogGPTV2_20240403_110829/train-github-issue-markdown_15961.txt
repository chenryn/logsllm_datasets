Given its role in ternary expressions (and perhaps in more upcoming syntactic
constructs?), isn't letting `?` be used as a variable name allowing too much
room for potential confusion?
    julia>  ? = true
    true
    julia>  ??!?:?
    false
    julia>  !??!?:!??!?:?
    true
    julia>  !???:!?:?
    false:true
    julia> (x->(?->?(?))(?->x(x->?(?)(x))))(x->(?->(?==0?1:(?*x(?-1))))).(?:?<<?<<?)
    4-element Array{Int64,1}:
      1
      2
      6
     24
(also isn't it amazing that these even parse?) Anyway, I suppose, unless one
really wants to use `?` as a function or macro name, that this possibility
could be deprecated?
