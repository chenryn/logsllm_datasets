# 5. Recovery Events

In this section, we examine the end-to-end path performance during recovery events, specifically focusing on those events that result in changes to the end-to-end path. When routes through both providers are available, the probe host switches to the restored provider, leading to a path change. We will first present the packet loss, delay, and packet reordering for these events, followed by an analysis of the root causes of packet loss during recovery.

## 5.1 Data Plane Performance

Similar to our analysis of failover events, we measure the performance (in terms of loss, delay, and packet reordering) using UDP packet probes from 37 PlanetLab sites. There are two types of recovery events: (1) announcing the route to ISP 1 (denoted as "recovery-1") and (2) announcing the route to ISP 2 (denoted as "recovery-2"). Among the 37 probing hosts, 12 hosts choose the restored path via ISP 1, and 25 hosts choose the restored path via ISP 2 when routes to both ISPs are available.

Figure 10 illustrates the number of loss bursts during recovery events across all probe hosts undergoing path changes over the entire duration of our study. The x-axis represents the start time of a loss burst, measured in seconds relative to the injection of announcement messages. In Figure 10(a), which shows recovery-1 events, we do not observe a significant number of loss bursts after time 0 (the time when the announcement message is advertised). However, in Figure 10(b), which shows recovery-2 events, we observe that loss bursts occur immediately after time 0 and can last up to 100 seconds. Despite variations in the magnitude of the loss burst peaks, more than half of the end hosts (i.e., 29 PlanetLab hosts) experience packet loss during recovery events.

To understand the extent of packet loss caused by recovery events, we divide the period of UDP packet probing into three intervals: (1) before path changes, (2) during path changes, and (3) after path changes. Figures 11(a) and 12(a) show the loss burst length during routing changes compared to those before and after routing changes. We observe that the loss burst length during routing changes does not differ significantly from those before or after. Figure 11(a) also indicates that more packets are dropped after path changes, likely due to congestion, as no routing changes are observed in traceroute measurements and no corresponding ICMP messages are received. This observation is consistent with the findings for failover events shown in Figure 2(a). Additionally, loss burst lengths can be as long as 180 packets for recovery-1 events and 140 packets for recovery-2 events, suggesting that such loss is primarily caused by routing failures.

### Table 5: Packet Loss Caused by Routing Changes During Recovery Events

| Causes                      | Recovery-1 | Recovery-2 |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------|
| Loss packets                | 1120 (26%) | 480 (43%)  |
| Verified as routing failures | 640 (57%)  | 3266 (74%) |
| - Loop-free                 | 41 (12%)   | 17 (41%)   |
| - Forwarding loop           | 24 (59%)   | 290 (88%)  |
| Loss bursts                 | 76 (4%)    | 39 (51%)   |
| Unverified as routing failures | 37 (49%) | 1714 (96%) |

In addition to loss burst length, we also measure packet round-trip delays and reordered packets. Figure 11(b) shows the round-trip delay distribution for recovery-1 events, indicating that the impact on packet delays is similar to that of failover events. However, Figures 11(c) and 11(d) show that the average reordering offset or degree of reordering is smaller for recovery events (about 2) compared to failover events (about 6). The total amount of reordering is also significantly less, and interestingly, reordering during recovery events is slightly lower than during normal times, suggesting that recovery events do not contribute much to packet reordering.

Figure 12 presents the corresponding metrics for recovery-2 events, showing similar results: packet delays are no different from those for failover events, and the average offset for out-of-order packets is no more than three packets. From all the performance metrics, we find that recovery events have the most significant impact on loss burst length. Next, we identify the causes of packet loss during such routing changes.

## 5.2 Root Causes of Loss Bursts

During recovery events, we observe that loss bursts are often long, prompting us to analyze whether some of these losses are caused by routing failures. This may seem unlikely since paths to both providers are available, and the old route through the less preferred provider is still usable while routers switch to the more preferred, newly announced route. However, our measurement results show that routing failures do indeed occur during recovery events.

Similar to our analysis of failover events, we correlate ICMP unreachable messages with loss bursts. Table 5 shows that 26% of packet loss is verified to be caused by routing failures. Note that the actual number of packet losses caused by routing failures might be higher, as ICMP messages may be filtered by some Internet routers.

Additionally, we evaluate routing failures from BGP updates collected from 12 routers within ISP 2. From over 724 recovery events, we observe 12 BGP withdrawals sent by these monitored routers. We also note that there is little time difference between the withdrawal and the subsequent announcement, which are for the same prefix but with different BGP AS paths. While the occurrence of routing failures during recovery events is rare, the routers within ISP 2 do temporarily lose their routes to the Beacon.

We measure the duration of a loss burst as the time interval between the latest received packet before the loss and the earliest one after. Figure 13(a) shows the cumulative distribution of the duration of loss bursts, both verified and unverified as caused by routing failures. We observe that verified loss bursts are, on average, longer than unverified ones. During recovery events, more than 98% of routing failures last less than 5 seconds, compared to about 80% during failover events, as shown in Figure 5. This means that loss bursts caused by routing failures during recovery events are much shorter than those during failover events. Unverified loss bursts typically last less than 4 seconds.

Figure 13(b) shows the duration of verified loss bursts caused by loop-free routing failures and forwarding loops. We observe that 57% of packet loss is due to forwarding loops, slightly higher than for failover events (47%). This implies that forwarding loops are also quite common during recovery events.

## 5.3 How Routing Failures Occur

To illustrate how packets can be dropped due to path changes during recovery events, consider the simplified topology in Figure 14. Solid arrow lines indicate the path used before a recovery event, while dashed arrow lines represent the new path after the recovery. In this example, if a packet is forwarded along the old path (solid line) while the new path (dashed line) is being established, it may encounter a forwarding loop or other routing failure, leading to packet loss.

In summary, recovery events, although intended to restore network connectivity, can introduce significant packet loss and other performance issues. Understanding the root causes and characteristics of these issues is crucial for improving the robustness and reliability of network recovery mechanisms.
