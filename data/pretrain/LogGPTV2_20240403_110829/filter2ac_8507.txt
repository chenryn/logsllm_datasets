**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Management

To enforce the principle of least privilege, restrict the privileges of user accounts so that only authorized accounts can modify and/or add server software components. This ensures that only necessary permissions are granted, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes or additions to the server environment.
