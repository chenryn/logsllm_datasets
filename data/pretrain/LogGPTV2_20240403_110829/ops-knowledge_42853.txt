User: i've installed py 2.7 (64bit) on my PC with Win7 (64bit) without problem but I'm not able to run *.py scripts via DOS shell without declare python full path.
Let me better explain :
If I type D:\ myscript.py it doesn't work. The script is open with wordpad 
If I type D:\ C:\Python27 myscript.py it works and run correctly
I try to change the default application software for *.py file via Win7 GUI ( control pannel etc etc) but without success.
Python is not present in the list of available sw and in any case also with the manual set I'm not able to associate python.exe at *.py files.
I've checked in my environment variables but I've not  found problem (python path  is declared in Path = C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts).
I've tried also to modify HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT->Applications->python.exe->shell->open->command :
old register  value "C:\Python27\python.exe" "%1"
new register  value "C:\Python27\python.exe" "%1" %*
without success.
Any suggestion?
Thanks
Assistant: Here is another check to make, which helped me figure out what was going on.
I switched from the 32bit Anaconda to the 64bit version. I deinstalled, downloaded then reinstalled, but several things didn't get cleaned up properly (quick launch stuff, and some registry keys). The problem on my side was that the default installation path changed, from C:\Anaconda to C:\Anaconda2.
I first tried the assoc and ftype tricks, everything was fine there. However, the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\python.exe\shell\open\command registry key was pointing to the old Anaconda path. As soon as I fixed this, python.exe showed up when I tried associating with "Open with" and everything went back to normal.
I also added the %* at the end in the registry key.
