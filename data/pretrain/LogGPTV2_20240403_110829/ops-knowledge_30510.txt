### How to Prevent Brute Force Attacks on a Terminal Server (Windows 2008 R2)

If you are familiar with Linux tools for mitigating brute force attacks but need a solution for a Windows environment, this guide will help. Specifically, we will address how to block an IP after multiple failed login attempts via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on a Windows Server 2008 R2 system.

#### Step 1: Edge Firewall Configuration
The most effective way to prevent brute force attacks is to configure your edge firewall to rate-limit or block suspicious traffic. If you have access to the edge firewall, set up rules to limit the number of RDP login attempts from a single IP address within a specific time frame. This can significantly reduce the risk of brute force attacks.

#### Step 2: Windows Firewall Configuration
If you do not have control over the edge firewall, you can still use the built-in Windows Firewall to restrict incoming RDP connections. Follow these steps:

1. **Open Windows Firewall with Advanced Security:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `wf.msc`, and press Enter.
   
2. **Create a New Inbound Rule:**
   - Click on "Inbound Rules" in the left pane.
   - Click "New Rule" in the right pane.
   - Select "Custom" and click Next.
   - Choose "All programs" and click Next.
   - For the protocol and ports, select "TCP" and specify port `3389` (the default RDP port).
   - In the scope, specify the IP addresses or ranges that are allowed to connect. If you only need RDP access from specific IPs, enter them here.
   - Set the action to "Block the connection" and apply the rule to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public).
   - Name the rule and finish the wizard.

#### Step 3: Using a Script to Block Brute Force Attempts
If you must have RDP open to the entire Internet, you can use a script to block repeated login attempts. One such script is `ts_block`, which is a modified version of an SSH brute force blocker for Windows. This script can be found in a GitHub repository and is designed to work with Windows Server 2003, 2008, and 2008 R2.

However, due to changes in the logging mechanism in later versions of Windows, especially when using the TLS/SSL security layer for RDP, the effectiveness of this script may be limited. The script relies on event logs to identify and block malicious IP addresses, but newer versions of Windows no longer log the IP address of the host attempting to authenticate, making it difficult to track and block attackers.

To use `ts_block`:
1. **Download the Script:**
   - Visit the GitHub repository and download the `ts_block` script.
   
2. **Configure the Script:**
   - Edit the script to match your environment, including the threshold for failed login attempts and the duration for which an IP should be blocked.
   
3. **Run the Script:**
   - Schedule the script to run periodically using Task Scheduler to monitor and block suspicious IP addresses.

#### Conclusion
By configuring your edge firewall, using the built-in Windows Firewall, and employing a script like `ts_block`, you can effectively mitigate brute force attacks on your Windows Server 2008 R2 Terminal Server. Always ensure that your server is up-to-date with the latest security patches and consider additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to further enhance your security posture.
