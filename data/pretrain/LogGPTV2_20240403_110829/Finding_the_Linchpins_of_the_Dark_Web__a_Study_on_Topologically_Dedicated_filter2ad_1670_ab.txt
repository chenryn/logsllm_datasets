### Doorway Pages and Malicious Path Identification

A doorway page often contains multiple URLs, some of which are legitimate and redirect to other legitimate sites (e.g., DoubleClick), as shown in Figure 1. To avoid incorrectly marking these pages as malicious, we further inspect whether there are any non-doorway URLs on a suspicious path that are also marked as malicious. If such URLs exist, the corresponding path is labeled as malicious. For paths where doorway pages directly contain exploit code, we label them as malicious without needing to examine other URLs. If all URL paths corresponding to a host path are labeled as malicious, the host path is also labeled as malicious.

### Labeling Legitimate URLs

We label the remaining URLs that correspond to reputable domains or known ad services as legitimate. This process involves clustering non-malicious URLs based on their domains and manually examining clusters with over 1,000 URLs each. We identified 19 reputable domains, such as google.com and facebook.com, and used them to label legitimate URLs. Additionally, we utilized EasyList [21] and EasyPrivacy [22] to identify ad networks and trackers, which are also used by the popular browser plugin Adblock Plus [20]. Since URL shorteners (e.g., t.co) are extensively used by Twitter users, we also identified them using a known list [18].

This labeling process is not exhaustive. All it does is provide a set of URLs and paths confirmed as malicious or legitimate based on existing tools (e.g., Forefront, whitelists). The remaining 78.51% of URLs are treated as unknown, and our goal is to develop a methodology for automatically detecting malicious entities from them.

### Topology-Based Measurements

In this section, we study the properties of malicious URLs and host paths, focusing on their topologies and connections. Our measurements reveal the existence of topologically dedicated hosts that play critical roles in malicious activities. These unique properties inspire us to develop a graph-based detection approach that can capture these hosts without any information about their content or code.

#### Hostname-IP Cluster (HIC) Construction

To study web entity topologies, we construct Hostname-IP Clusters (HICs) that capture the intrinsic sharing relations between hostnames and IP addresses. Prior research shows that attackers often register many malicious hostnames, all pointing to a small set of IP addresses under one domain registrar [19]. Once a hostname is detected, attackers can quickly switch to another. From a topological perspective, individual URLs or hostnames may not provide strong enough signals to distinguish them.

Our solution uses Whois information [31] to guide the clustering process. Two hosts sharing IPs are considered related only if their domain names are from the same registrar. This is effective because malicious hosts prefer low-cost, less well-known registrars. The HIC construction process is as follows:

1. Assign a unique HIC instance to every hostname.
2. Merge HICs iteratively by computing the overlapping of their IPs. Let \( \text{IPS}_1 \) be the IP set for HIC \( H_1 \), and \( \text{IPS}_2 \) be that of HIC \( H_2 \). \( H_1 \) and \( H_2 \) are merged if the Jaccard distance \( \frac{\text{IPS}_1 \cap \text{IPS}_2}{\text{IPS}_1 \cup \text{IPS}_2} \) is greater than a threshold \( T_{\text{IPS}} \). We set this threshold to 0.5 to accommodate variations caused by CDNs and fast-fluxing [10].
3. Check the Whois information; only merge HICs if their registrars are identical.
4. Repeat until no HIC pairs can be further merged.

Figure 2 illustrates this process. HIC1 and HIC2 can be merged since their IP address overlap is 60% and they have the same registrar. HIC3 is not merged with any other HICs because its registrar is different.

#### Topologically Dedicated Malicious HICs

Using the above method, we obtained 1,951,313 HICs from our data. Among them, 15,273 HICs host only confirmed malicious URL paths (and corresponding host paths) in our datasets (collected over a 7-month period). These are called dedicated malicious HICs, while the others are non-dedicated malicious HICs. Dedicated HICs are attached to 76.2% of the malicious paths across all data sources. Their hostnames often exhibit patterns of domain rotations and are registered under unpopular domain registrars. Table III lists the top 10 dedicated malicious HICs.

#### Graph Properties of Dedicated Malicious HICs

When examining the inter-connections among HICs, we find that dedicated HICs are highly intertwined. Among 15,273 dedicated malicious HICs, 12,942 (84.74%) are located on a fully connected subgraph. They are also intensely connected with other non-dedicated malicious HICs: 80.40% of non-dedicated malicious HICs are directly or indirectly connected to at least one dedicated HIC.

Dedicated malicious HICs rarely receive traffic from legitimate or unknown parties. Figure 3 shows that 97.75% of dedicated malicious HICs do not receive any traffic redirections from legitimate HICs. In contrast, 25.70% of non-dedicated malicious HICs receive traffic redirections from legitimate HICs.

In terms of "link-out" relations, dedicated malicious HICs are less likely to redirect traffic to legitimate HICs. Figure 4 shows that 28.30% of dedicated malicious HICs redirect visitors to legitimate hosts, compared to 61.53% of non-dedicated malicious HICs.

The graph properties of dedicated malicious HICs indicate they are well-connected and easy to reach from known malicious URLs but much harder to access from legitimate ones. This suggests using the PageRank algorithm to detect them without relying on semantic information.

### Detecting Dedicated Malicious HICs

Our measurement study shows the existence of topologically dedicated malicious HICs, which appear to be the linchpins of malicious web infrastructures. Detecting such HICs can help discover many other malicious hosts, including doorways and redirectors. To detect these dedicated hosts, we explore their unique topological features.
