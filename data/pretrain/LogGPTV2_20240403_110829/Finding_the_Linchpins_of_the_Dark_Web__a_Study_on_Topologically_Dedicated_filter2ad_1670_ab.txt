doorway page contains multiple URLs, some of which
are legitimate and redirect to other legitimate sites (e.g.,
doubleclick), as illustrated in Figure 1. To avoid marking
them as malicious, we further inspect whether there exists
another non-doorway URL on a suspicious path also marked
as malicious. If so, we label the corresponding path as a
malicious path. For the paths whose doorway pages directly
contain exploit code, we label
these paths as malicious
without the need of examining other URLs. If all the URL
paths corresponding to a host path are labeled as malicious,
we label the host path as malicious as well.

Labeling of legitimate URLs. We also label the remaining
URLs that correspond to reputable domains or known ad
services as legitimate URLs. To do so, we ﬁrst cluster the
non-malicious URLs based on their domains and manually
examine the URL clusters with over 1,000 URLs each.
Among these clusters, we identify 19 reputable ones, such as
google.com and facebook.com, and we use them to
label legitimate URLs. In addition, we use EasyList [21] and
EasyPrivacy [22] to identify ad-networks and trackers. These
two lists are also utilized by the popular browser plugin
Adblock plus [20] to block ads and tracking scripts. Finally,
since URL shorteners (e.g., t.co) are extensively used by
Twitter users to embed URLs in Tweets, we also identify
them using a known list compiled for this purpose [18].
Of course, this labeling process is not exhaustive. All

it does is to provide a set of URLs and paths that are
conﬁrmed malicious or legitimate based on existing tools
(e.g., Forefront, whitelists). The rest of the URLs (78.51%)
are treated as unknown and our goal is to come up with a
methodology for automatically detecting malicious parties
from them.
III. TOPOLOGY-BASED MEASUREMENTS
In this section, we study the properties of malicious URLs
and host paths. We focus on examining the topologies and
the connections of malicious and legitimate entities. Our
measurements reveal the existence of a set of topologically
dedicated hosts that play critical roles in malicious activities.
The unique properties of these hosts inspire us to develop
a graph-based detection approach, which can capture these
hosts without any information about their semantics, e.g.,
the content they accommodate or the code they run.
A. Hostname-IP Cluster (HIC) Construction
To study Web entity topologies, one natural way is to
examine individual URLs or hostnames. However, prior
research shows that attackers often register hundreds of
malicious hostnames, all pointing to a small set of IP
addresses under one domain registrar [19]. Once a hostname
is detected, attackers can quickly switch to another one in
the pool. From the topology perspective, the signals of such
short-lived individual URLs or hostnames may not be strong
enough to distinguish them.
Instead, we explore the groups of URLs or hostnames
that are controlled by the same attackers. For this purpose,
we construct Hostname-IP Clusters (HICs) that capture
the intrinsic sharing relations between hostnames and IP
addresses. The concept of HICs has been used in prior
research [33] to detect servers that play central roles in
drive-by download campaigns. A problem of their deﬁni-
tion is that it is solely based upon the relations between
IPs and hostnames, which does not work well on today’s
Web, where attackers increasingly utilize hosting or cloud
services. When this happens, all the hosts running on a cloud
server will be clustered together.
Our solution is to use the Whois information [31] to guide
this clustering process: two hosts sharing IPs are considered
to be related only if their domain names are from the same
registrar. Since malicious hosts strongly prefer low-cost, less
well known registrars (see Section III-C), this treatment
turns out to be very effective. More precisely, our HIC
construction process is as follows:
I We assign a unique HIC instance to every hostname.
II We start to merge these HICs in a similar way to that
in prior work [33]. The construction process iteratively
inspects every pair of HICs. We ﬁrst compute the
overlapping of their IPs. Let IP S1 be the IP set for
HIC H1, and IP S2 be that of HIC H2. H1 and H2
are considered to be merged if the Jaccard distance
IP S1∩IP S2
is larger than a threshold TIP S. Similar

to [33], we set this threshold to 0.5, to accommodate the
IP variations caused by content-distribution networks
(CDN) and fast-ﬂuxing [10]. Besides this criterion, we
take an additional step to check their Whois informa-
tion. Only if their registrars are also identical can we
merge them together. The above process iterates until
no HIC pairs can further merge.
Figure 2 illustrates this process. HIC1 and HIC2 can be
merged since their IP address overlapping is 60% and they
have the same registrar. HIC3 is not merged with any other
HICs because its registrar is different from others.

B. Topologically Dedicated Malicious HICs
All together, we obtain 1,951,313 HICs using the above
method from our data. Among them, 15,273 are found to
only host conﬁrmed malicious URL paths (and the corre-
sponding host paths) in our datasets (collected over a 7-
month period). This topological property differentiates them
from other HICs, which contain at least one URL path that
we cannot conﬁrm. We call the former dedicated malicious
HICs and the latter non-dedicated malicious HICs.
These dedicated HICs apparently play a critical role in
the malicious activities: they are attached to 76.2% of the
malicious paths across all the data sources in Table II. Al-
though we have no ground truth about whether the dedicated
malicious HICs are indeed set up by malicious parties, we
ﬁnd that their hostnames usually exhibit patterns of domain
rotations and that they are often registered under unpopular
domain registrars2. Table III lists the top 10 (ranked by the
number of paths going through) dedicated malicious HICs
in our datasets. Such observations suggest that these HICs
may correspond to dedicated hosts that are set up for just
malicious uses, e.g., “central servers” for drive-by download
campaigns [33].
C. Graph Properties of Dedicated Malicious HICs
When we examine the inter-connections among HICs, we
ﬁnd that these dedicated HICs are not isolated. Instead,
they tend to connect to each other. To understand their

connectivity, we build an HIC graph by linking two HICs
with a directed edge if there is an URL redirection between
their hosts. In total, we have 1,951,313 HIC nodes and
9,058,597 edges on the HIC graph.
Closely examining these dedicated malicious HICs, we
ﬁnd that they are highly intertwined: among 15,273 ded-
icated malicious HICs, 12,942 (84.74%) are located on a
fully connected subgraph. The dedicated malicious HICs are
also intensely connected with other non-dedicated malicious
HICs: 80.40% of non-dedicated malicious HICs are directly
or indirectly connected to at least one dedicated HIC. This
observation indicates that the dedicated malicious HICs are
quite easy to reach from the “dark” world. Starting from a
few malicious URLs and following their redirect chains, you
may easily reach some dedicated malicious HICs.

In contrast, these dedicated malicious HICs rarely receive
trafﬁc from legitimate or unknown parties (labeled by the
methodology in Section II-C), even when these legitimate
parties do appear on malicious paths. In terms of such a
“link-in” relation, the dedicated malicious HICs are more
remote to legitimate parties than non-dedicated malicious
HICs. Figure 3 shows that 97.75% of the dedicated malicious
HICs do not receive any trafﬁc redirections from legitimate
HICs. For the rest 2.25% of dedicated malicious HICs that
do, they mostly correspond to malicious entities that have

inﬁltrated legitimate ad networks (e.g., Doubleclick) and
receive trafﬁc from them [16]. By comparison, 25.70% of
non-dedicated malicious HICs receive trafﬁc redirections
from other legitimate HICs. This observation shows that
compared to legitimate or non-dedicated malicious HICs,
the topologically dedicated malicious HICs are much harder
to reach from the bright side of the Web.
In terms of the “link-out” relations, dedicated malicious
HICs are less likely to redirect trafﬁc to legitimate HICs.
This usually happens when those malicious parties cloak.
Figure 4 shows that 28.30% of the dedicated malicious HICs
redirect their visitors to legitimate hosts, compared with
61.53% of non-dedicated malicious HICs that do the same.
The graph properties of these dedicated malicious HICs
show that they are well connected and easy to reach from
known malicious URLs, but they are much harder to get
to from legitimate ones. This observation provides strong
implications for developing the right technique to detect
them. Particularly, the well-known PageRank algorithm ﬁts
well with such topological properties, and therefore we adopt
it
those hosts without relying
on their semantic information. Note that what we focus
on here is dedicated malicious HICs. Those non-dedicated,
particularly compromised hosts, may not have such graph
properties. As a result, the PageRank approach may not be
applicable to ﬁnd them. In the next section, we explain the
this detection method in detail.

IV. DETECTING DEDICATED MALICIOUS HICS
Our measurement study shows that there exist a set of
topologically dedicated malicious HICs. These dedicated
HICs are important because they appear to be the linchpins
of malicious Wed infrastructures, linking to 76.2% malicious
host paths across all the datasets we have crawled over
a 7-month period. Since all the paths going through the
corresponding hosts are malicious, detecting such dedicated
malicious HICs can help us discover many other malicious
hosts including doorways, redirectors, and others.
To detect such dedicated hosts, we explore the unique
topological features of these HICs. Of most interest are
