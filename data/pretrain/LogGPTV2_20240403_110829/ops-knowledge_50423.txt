User:  Please describe what a cyber attack is and give examples.
Assistant: network attack refers to a malicious attack on a target host, system or information on the network. These attacks can cause a certain degree of harm to network security, including data leakage, service interruption, malware infection and so on. The following are some common network attacks and their examples: 1. DDos attack: The attacker sends a large number of requests to the target server, causing the server to be paralyzed and unable to process the request, and finally forced to interrupt the service. For example, in 2016, the British Lianjia company and GitHub company were attacked by DDos. 2. Virus attack: The attacker infects the target computer with virus software, then steals data, tampers with files, damages the system, etc. For example, the WannaCry virus in the global hacking incident in 2017 infected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 200 countries around the world. 3. Phishing attack: Attackers lure users into entering sensitive information, such as bank account passwords, credit card numbers, etc., by spoofing legal organization websites and emails. For example, in 2016, Yahoo announced that there had been a data breach incident of breaking into a house. Impersonating a technician, the scammers emailed pretending to be dealing with a system issue and asked Yahoo employees for permission to access their computers. 4. Trojan horse attack: The attacker steals the user's password, account information, etc. by installing the Trojan horse software. For example, in 2018, the Network Center of the China Special Equipment Inspection Institute was exposed to have installed Trojan horse programs in some computers, which infringed on the personal information and data security of network users on a large scale.
