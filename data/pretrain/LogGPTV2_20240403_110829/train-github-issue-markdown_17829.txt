### Apache Airflow version
2.2.4 (latest released)
### What happened
After setting up alert emails using AWS SES as instructed here, I received the
following error message:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/airflow/models/taskinstance.py", line 2103, in email_alert
        send_email(self.task.email, subject, html_content)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/airflow/utils/email.py", line 57, in send_email
        return backend(
    TypeError: send_email() got multiple values for argument 'from_email'
### What you expected to happen
the `send_email` method in
airflow/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/utils/emailer.py
Lines 25 to 37 in d94fa37
|  def send_email(  
---|---  
|  from_email: str,  
|  to: Union[List[str], str],  
|  subject: str,  
|  html_content: str,  
|  files: Optional[List] = None,  
|  cc: Optional[Union[List[str], str]] = None,  
|  bcc: Optional[Union[List[str], str]] = None,  
|  mime_subtype: str = 'mixed',  
|  mime_charset: str = 'utf-8',  
|  conn_id: str = 'aws_default',  
|  **kwargs,  
|  ) -> None:  
doesn't match the invocation of the `backend` method in
airflow/airflow/utils/email.py
Lines 57 to 70 in ee9049c
|  return backend(  
---|---  
|  to_comma_separated,  
|  subject,  
|  html_content,  
|  files=files,  
|  dryrun=dryrun,  
|  cc=cc,  
|  bcc=bcc,  
|  mime_subtype=mime_subtype,  
|  mime_charset=mime_charset,  
|  conn_id=backend_conn_id,  
|  from_email=from_email,  
|  **kwargs,  
|  )  
in the former (provider-amazon), the `from_email` is the first positional
argument. However in the latter (main airflow), `from_email` is misplaced as a
keyword argument.
### How to reproduce
