**Current behavior**  
We can use `ChangeDetectionStrategy` `onPush` to set components to
`checkOnce`, but there is no way to set one `@Input` to `checkOnce` without
changing others.
**Expected behavior**  
Could we add a way to set one `@Input` to `checkOnce` without changing others?
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
There is no angularjs double colon expression equivalent in current angular
version. It will be more convenient for the developer to have this feature in
angular.
    In a angularjs, when we declare a value such as `{{ ::foo }}` inside the DOM, once this value 
    becomes defined, Angularjs will render it, unbind it from the watchers and thus reduce the 
    volume of bindings inside the $digest loop.
