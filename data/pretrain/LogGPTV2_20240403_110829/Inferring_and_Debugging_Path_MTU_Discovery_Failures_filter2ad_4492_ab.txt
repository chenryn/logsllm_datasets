### 6. Inferring the MTU without Feedback

**Figure 1: Inferring the MTU without feedback.**
- **ICMP Black Hole:** An ICMP black hole exists between routers R1 and R3, where the MTU is restricted to 1480 bytes.
- **PMTUD Failure Detection:**
  - Probes 1 and 2 detect a PMTUD failure.
  - Probes 3 to 10 infer that the next-hop MTU is 1480 bytes.
  - Probes 11 to 14 infer that large packets are likely being discarded at hop 2.

**Time Exceeded Messages:**
- Small TTL-limited probes from adjacent hops do not receive Time Exceeded messages.
- Large probes from the first hop in the path receive Time Exceeded messages, indicating:
  - An interface configured not to send ICMP Destination Unreachable messages.
  - An MTU mismatch between adjacent routers.
  - PTB messages originating from a different interface than the one sending Time Exceeded messages, with a source address that causes the PTB message to be filtered.

### 3.3 Inferring MTU with Invalid Feedback

**Technique Overview:**
- This technique is used when a PTB (Packet Too Big) message is received in response to a large probe, but the next-hop MTU included in the PTB message is either not set or larger than the probe that triggered the message.
- It uses a variation of the next-hop MTU search technique described in Section 3.1, using the faulty PTB message instead of the absence of a PTB message to reduce the upper-bound of the search space.
- The method converges on the actual next-hop MTU rapidly if ICMP feedback is received for packets smaller than the next-hop MTU past the faulty router, as each probe size test costs one round-trip-time (RTT).

**Handling No ICMP Feedback:**
- If the path does not provide ICMP feedback after the faulty router due to another failure further in the path, scamper works progressively downwards through the MTU table soliciting faulty PTB messages rather than moving upwards.
- This is because scamper has to time-out on a probe which does not obtain ICMP feedback before it can send another probe, which has a much larger cost than sending packets that trigger faulty PTB messages.

### 3.4 Limitations

**Reliability Issues:**
- The techniques rely on ICMP messages for feedback, making them unreliable when ICMP rate-limiting is encountered.
- By default, scamper sends each probe twice with a five-second timeout between attempts. If two successive probes do not receive ICMP feedback due to rate-limiting, incorrect inferences may occur, such as an incorrect next-hop MTU, wrong location of a failure, or inferring a failure where none exists.

### 4. Methodology

**Data Collection:**
- PMTUD failure data was collected from two IPv4 hosts with 9000-byte MTU interfaces connected to networks that peer with Internet2, which is 9000-byte clean through the core, on April 28th, 2005.
- The first location was NYSERNet in New York, and the second was an Internet2 measurement machine in Chicago.
- The target list consisted of 147 NLANR AMP machines, typically on university campuses connected to the Internet2 network or networks that peer with Internet2.
- Most AMP machines connect to their host network with Intel Pro100 Ethernet interfaces, capable of sending 1500-byte IP packets. Some have Gigabit Ethernet interfaces capable of sending larger packets but are not configured to do so.
- The dataset aims to understand PMTUD failures on networks that can natively carry jumbo packets, requiring fragmentation at least at the edge of the campus network closer to each individual AMP machine.

### 5. Results

**Reachability and Failures:**
- Of the 147 AMP machines, traceroutes were completed to at least 134 machines (91%).
- A PMTUD failure was inferred for 30% of the reachable machines.

**Summary of Failures:**
- **No ICMP Messages:** 7 failure points.
- **No PTB Messages:** 22 failure points.
- **Incorrect PTB Messages:** 2 failure points.
- **Target MTU Mismatch:** 7 unique targets.

**Failure Analysis:**
- **No ICMP Messages:** Six failure points had a next-hop MTU of 1500 bytes, and one had a next-hop MTU of 1536 bytes.
- **ICMP Filtering:** One failure was caused by routers sending ICMP messages with a source address of 127.0.0.1, which were discarded by filters near the measurement hosts.
- **RFC 1918 Addresses:** Another router used RFC 1918 addresses, causing all ICMP messages to be filtered out.
- **BGP Routing Issue:** A BGP routing issue prevented routers on the forward path from having a route back to the source host.
- **Firewall:** A firewall blocked packets with specific source or destination addresses, including those of core routers.

**ICMP Time Exceeded Messages:**
- 22 hops received ICMP Time Exceeded messages but no PTB messages when expected.
- Sixteen of these hops had a next-hop MTU of 1500 bytes, accounting for two-thirds of the failures.
- Twenty unique failure locations were determined, with two upgraded before diagnosis.

**Technical Diagnoses:**
- Seven failures were diagnosed; three had disabled ICMP Destination Unreachable messages, and four were due to MTU mismatches or misconfigurations.
- For the remaining 11 failures, UDP probes to unused ports were used to determine if Destination Unreachable messages were disabled. Eight systems did not reply with a Destination Unreachable message.

**PTB Message Inconsistencies:**
- Two hops received PTB messages with incorrect next-hop MTUs. One router sent a PTB message with a suggested next-hop MTU of 4586 bytes but could only forward packets up to 4472 bytes.

**MTU Mismatch:**
- Seven targets were on subnets with inconsistent MTU agreements. Two of these targets could receive packets larger than 1500 bytes, despite using 1500-byte MTU interfaces. One could receive packets up to 2016 bytes, and the other up to 1506 bytes.

### 6. Two Anecdotes

**Invalid Next-Hop MTU:**
- A router in New York City, part of a large ISP's network, returned PTB messages with an invalid next-hop MTU of 4470 bytes for packet sizes between 4458 and 4470 bytes.
- Initial attempts to determine the cause were difficult, with suggestions of MPLS headers and a known router bug. The cause remains undetermined, and the matter is being pursued with a router vendor.

**IPv6 Router Bug:**
- An IPv6 router appeared to route IPv6 packets over an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel with an MTU of 1480 bytes but did not send PTB messages for larger packets.
- Instead, it sent two Destination Unreachable, No Route messages. The first message caused scamper to cease PMTUD, and the second message could not be matched to any probe.
- The fault was reported but never identified and corrected, eventually going away when the path was replaced with a native IPv6 path.

### 7. Conclusion

**Unreliability of Path MTU Discovery:**
- Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is unreliable due to the timely delivery of PTB messages, which are often disabled or firewalled in many networks.
- These failures go unnoticed in routine operational testing and monitoring, as they are only noticeable with larger probe packets.
- The default size of probe packets sent using traceroute and ping is too small to trigger PMTUD failures, leading to the assumption that a path is fully operational in the absence of packet loss.

**Debugging Techniques:**
- We presented a series of debugging techniques to infer PMTUD failures on the forward path.
- Using our implementation, we found that 30% of reachable targets had a failure preventing efficient end-to-end communication.
- Less than half of these failures were due to a configuration decision to disable necessary ICMP messages.
- As the Internet MTU increases and jumbo-capable Ethernet interfaces become more common, classical PMTUD methods will continue to be strained.
- Until new PMTUD approaches are widely deployed, our tool serves as a useful operational utility.
