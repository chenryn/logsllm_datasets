User: I have installed Python 3.2 in my Mac. After I run /Applications/Python 3.2/Update Shell Profile.command, it's confusing that when I type Python -V in Terminal it says that Python 2.6.1.
How can I change the default Python version?
Assistant: In short: change the path in Environment Variables!
For Windows: 

Advanced System Settings > Advance (tab). On bottom you'll find 'Environment Variables'
Double-click on the Path. You'll see path to one of the python installations, change that to path of your desired version.
