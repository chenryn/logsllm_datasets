User: I have a batch file that runs a python script. When the python script is invoked, it starts a second windows console and then disappears when it is completed. This is a problem because I am editing the PYTHONPATH environment variable in the batch file, but because the python script is running in a second window, it cannot see the edited PYTHONPATH environment variable. It used to work just fine (everything would run in the same windows console). I just installed Vista SP2 and this problem showed up. Any thoughts on how to fix what might be broken?
Thanks.
Assistant: Ok, so I decided to reinstall python. If I uninstall and reinstall (I was using the windows installer) in the default location, it seems to have no effect. I cleaned out the registry and reinstalled. Still no different. However, if I install python in a different location (other than the default) it seems to run fine. Something is obviously corrupt somewhere, but I don't know where. So I am going to just reinstall all of my other modules in a different location and go from there. 
Thank you all for your responses.
