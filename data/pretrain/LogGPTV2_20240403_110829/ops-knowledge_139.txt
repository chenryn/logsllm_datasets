User: At the beginning of the script, I use platform.system and platform.release to determine which OS and version the script is running on (so it knows it's data is in Application Support on Mac, home on unix-like and non-mac unix, appdata on windows <= XP, and appdata/roaming on windows >= Vista). I'd like to test my series of ifs, elifs, and elses what determine the os and release, but I only have access to Mac 10.6.7, some unknown release of Linux, and Windows 7. Is there a way to feed platform fake system and release information so I can be sure XP, Solaris, etc, would handle the script properly without having an installation?
Assistant: you could create your initialization functions to take those variables as parameters so it is easy to spoof them in testing
