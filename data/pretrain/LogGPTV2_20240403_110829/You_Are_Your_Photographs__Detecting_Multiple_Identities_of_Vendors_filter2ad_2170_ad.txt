investigation focus on precision, which is the ratio of true Sybil pairs
out of all the candidate pairs. This analysis does not cover recall,
given that there is no ground-truth about real-world Sybil accounts.
We follow the guidelines below for our manual examination:
For the cross-market pairs, we first check their usernames and
alias. If their usernames are identical (case-insensitive), or simi-
lar (e.g., with an edit distance =2, and one
username is not a substring of the other). More than 60% of these
pairs are detected as “confident Yes” (which will be missed by simple
name matching). Below, we provide examples of different manual
labels, and explain false positives.
Most of the Sybil pairs under “confident Yes” are not difficult to
verify. It occurred to us that vendors were not intentionally hiding
their multiple accounts on different markets. Instead, some ven-
dors even advertise their other accounts and maintain a consistent
trademark for their brand. This explains why some vendors use the
same or similar usernames. For example, (“marvel-labs”, “Marvel-
Labs”) and (“GoingPostal”, “goingpOZtal”). Some Sybils pairs try
to make their usernames sound similar, e.g., “Concentrate-Dealer”
and “Concentr8-Dealer”. Among the confirmed Sybil pairs, some
vendors have a unique writing style. For example, for “RastainPeace”
(Agora) and “DrugsLover” (Evolution), both accounts like to write
sentences ending with the word “seriously”.
Figure 6 shows randomly selected images from a confirmed Sybil
pair. The two accounts share a high image similarity score (Sim =
0.505), and we obtain external confirmation from the buyers’ online
discussions. This vendor has a clear photo-shooting style. He/she
likes to take close shots of the piles of the drug pills. The vendor also
likes to use the same black tabletop or a piece of paper as the photo
background. We also notice that the vendor has re-shaped/cropped
the images before putting them onto different markets. The product
description contains both Swedish and English and thus stylometry
analysis does not work for this vendor. In fact, the two usernames
are somehow connected: “swecan” sounds similar to “Sweden”,
while “apoteket” means pharmacist in Swedish.
As shown in Table 6, intra-market
Sybils in the Same Market.
Sybils are less common compared to the inter-market Sybils. Only
95 pairs are detected and only 23 pairs are “Confident Yes”. A possi-
ble explanation is darknet markets usually prohibit a vendor from
registering multiple accounts in the same market to prevent abuse.
In contrary, it is common for a vendor to maintain accounts in
different markets to maximize their sales.

is only O (N ). This is because deep neural networks allow us to
train a multi-class classifier, and thus each vendor only needs to
go through the classifier once. In addition, the transfer learning
makes the vendor-specific training quicker. The computational
overhead is already acceptable, and the performance can be further
improved with more powerful machines and optimized algorithms.
For example, the similarity comparison can be easily parallelized,
as the numbers of vendors and markets increase.
Figure 7 shows an example Sybil pair from Agora. The two
accounts do not have many identical photos, but the styles of the
photos have similarities. This vendor likes to place the products
on a black table to take photos. In addition, some of the products
are the same even though the photos are shot from different angles.
Finally, the vendor also likes to place a coin (e.g., a quarter) in the
photo to reference the size. Manual analysis also shows that they
have similar writing styles in the product descriptions.
Our goal is to significantly
Sybil Pairs of Low Confidence.
reduce the scope of manual analysis. Instead of manually checking
all the possible vendor pairs, we select the most suspicious ones
for human analysts. For example, the above analysis covers 1020
vendors in Agora, 1093 vendors in Evolution and 415 vendors in
SilkRoad2 (2528 vendors in total). Intra-market analysis calculate
the similarity score for 1,203,637 pairs, and inter-market analysis ex-
amines 1,99,1755 pairs. Clearly, the total 3,195,392 pairs are beyond
the capacity of manual inspection, and our algorithm has helped
the security analysts to narrow down to 850 candidate pairs. This
process inevitable introduces false positives. In general, our DNN
based approach is designed for object recognition and analyzing
the vendors’ photo styles. The model is good at identifying similar
object shapes and colors, and the background texture, but cannot
make sense of the photos like a human analyst.
We have a few pairs under “Probably Yes” (38). For example
“Gnarl” (Evolution) and “modalsol” (Evolution) both sell drugs with
images of molecular structures. However, through Google image
search, we find that they were using stock images from Wikipedia
instead of taking their own photos. We cannot guarantee that the
two accounts belong to the same vendor. Another example, is “grif-
fin36” and “Cafe_Deluxe”. The two accounts use the same product
images, but all the image seem to be stolen from other vendors
(based on the visible watermarks on the images).
For the 74 pairs under “Probably No”, evidence suggests that
they are likely to be different accounts. For example, “subzero!!”
(Agora) and “piblz” (Evolution) posted many similar images, but
their writing styles are quite different and have different shipping
information. In addition, “subzero” always add this sentence “Read
our Profile for more about what we do” to the product description
while “piblz” never do that. Some of these pairs look like false
positives caused by the DNN classifier. For example, Figure 8 shows
the two vendors that are incorrectly matched due to the red text
in the images. The red text is the username of each vendor (as the
trademark). The deep neural network picked up the red-color area
as a feature, but could not tell the difference between the text.

7 CASE STUDY
Based on the detected Sybil pairs, we then perform case studies to
examine the motivations and behavior patterns of Sybil vendors.
Price Differences of Sybil Vendors. We first analyze the Sybil
accounts’ product prices and examine potential market manipula-
tions. Given a “confirmed” Sybil pair, we match their products from
the two accounts based on the product type and the listing time.
Our consideration is that different types of products may have a
different price range, and the price is likely to change over time.
We set the matching time window as 1 week. For the matched
product pairs (A,B), we calculate the normalized price difference
as d (A, B) = loge ( PA
), where P is the product price. A positive
PB
(negative) d indicates that product A is more (less) expensive.
Figure 9(a) shows the price difference for inter-market Sybil
pairs. All three curves are relatively balanced around the x = 0
line, indicating that products from the same vendor are within a
similar price range across different markets. For a small portion of
products, however, the price differences can be large (e.g., d = 3 is
equivalent to 20 times more expensive). Comparing the different
markets, Evolution’s price is relatively lower. This, however, is not
necessarily an indication of market manipulation. Even for non-
Sybil vendors, Evolution has the lowest product price (median $74)
compared to the other two markets (median $101 and $132).
Larger price differences are observed between intra-market Sybils.
Figure 9(b) compares the two Sybils accounts in same markets. For a
given Sybil pair, we first differentiate the bigger account (with more
products) and the smaller account (with fewer products). Then we
calculate loge ( PA
) where A represents the smaller account, and B
PB
represents the bigger account. For Evolution and SilkRoad2, both
curves are heavily skewed to the left, indicating that the smaller
accounts tend to sell the products at a significantly cheaper price. A
possible explanation is the vendor wants to attract buyers or even
to perform scam using the smaller account. In contrary, the Agora
line is relatively balanced.
Figure 9(c) further compares the product price of Sybil accounts
with that of other vendors in the same market. The curves of Evo-
lution and SilkRoad2 are skewed to the left. This suggests that
regardless the bigger or smaller accounts, Sybils’ product price is
substantially lower than that of the rest of the market, which is an
indicator of market manipulation.
Certain vendors create

multiple accounts in the same market just to “scam” the buyers. Sybil
vendors may refuse to ship the product after receiving the payment,
or switch the original product to a lower-quality one. Using a Sybil
account, the vendor does not need to worry about the reputation.

section of Reddit), we confirm that at least 3 of our detected Sybil
pairs have involved in scams. For example, “Stratton” and “Montfort”
are a detected Sybil pair on Agora. On Reddit, buyers reported that
they were scammed by these two accounts. Some buyers even stated
that the two accounts followed very similar writing styles when
replying private emails. We also find that 86.6% (174/201) of their
products have a lower price than the matched products of other
vendors. This confirms our early intuition that scammers use lower
prices to attract buyers.
Sybils pairs that are labeled
Product Stocking and Reselling.
as “Probably No” are not completely useless. Even though they are
not the same vendor, most of the detected accounts sell similar prod-
ucts. By analyzing these Sybil pairs, we reveal interesting patterns
of product stocking and reselling. For example, our model detected
two intra-market Sybil pairs on SilkRoad2: (“UGL OZ”, “labsdirect”)
and (“OZAlpha”, “labsdirect”). Manual analysis shows that vendor
“UGL OZ” mainly sells steroid stored in bottles with a special label
“UGL OZ”. At the same time, we find the same bottles also show
up in the photos of “labsdirect” and “OZAlpha”. According to the
comments on the vendor profile, “OZAlpha” stated that he was
stocking up the products of “UGL OZ”. This indicates the relation-
ships between the darknet vendors:“UGL OZ” is the producer of
those bottles of steroid, and “labsdirect” and “OZAlpha” were pur-
chasing the products and stocking them for reselling. With the help
our tool, it is possible to further automate the analysis to infer the
relationships between vendors and detect the stakeholders in the
market (future work).
Photo plagiarizing is one of the reasons

for the false positives. There are two main types. First, vendors may
use the stock photos they find on the Internet. Second, vendors may
“steal” photos from other vendors. The later case is more interesting
to investigate further. For example, vendor “ICANTMTT2” (Agora)
and “AussiesFinest” (Agora) share one identical photo of drugs.
Based on the profile of “ICANTMTT2”, this vendor is relatively
new and his drugs were directly purchased from the drug maker. At
the same time, “AussiesFinest” is a more established vendor and has
many photos with the same background and layout. It looks like
“AussiesFinest” is the original owner of the photo. There are several
possible reasons for the photo plagiarizing. First, it is possible that
“ICANTMTT2” purchased the drug from “AussiesFinest” for stock-
ing and reselling, and thus it is reasonable to use the same photo.
Second, it is also possible that “ICANTMTT2” stole the photo to
make the product attractive to buyers (leveraging the established
reputation of “AussiesFinest”’s drugs).
8 DISCUSSION
Inter-market & Intra-market Sybils. We identified hundreds
of inter-market Sybil pairs, but only a handful of intra-market Sybils.
There are two possible explanations: First, it is acceptable for a
vendor to have accounts in different markets, but holding multiple
accounts in the same market is usually prohibited. Due to the high
anonymity of the darknet, the vendor reputation is a key factor
to buyers’ purchase decisions. Keeping one persistent account for
each vendor helps the market administrator and buyers to assess
the vendor’s reputation. Second, after creating a vendor account,
the vendor will need to pay several hundreds of US dollars as the
“security deposit” in order to list products. The security deposit also
makes it difficult for a vendor to create a large number of Sybil
accounts in the same market.
