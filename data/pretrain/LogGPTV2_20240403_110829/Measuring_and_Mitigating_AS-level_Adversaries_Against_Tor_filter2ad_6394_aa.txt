## Abstract
The increasing popularity of Tor as an anonymity system has made it a prime target for various attacks, including traffic correlation attacks. These attacks, which correlate traffic entering and exiting the Tor network, are no longer just theoretical; recent revelations indicate that agencies like the NSA and GCHQ are actively working to implement them in practice.

Our first contribution is an empirical study that provides a high-fidelity snapshot of the threat posed by traffic correlation attacks. We find that up to 40% of all Tor circuits are vulnerable to AS-level adversaries, 42% to colluding AS-level adversaries, and 85% to state-level adversaries. In some regions, such as China and Iran, over 95% of possible circuits are vulnerable, underscoring the need for AS-aware relay selection.

To mitigate these threats, we introduce Astoria, an AS-aware Tor client. Astoria leverages recent developments in network measurement to perform path prediction and intelligent relay selection. Our results show that Astoria reduces the number of vulnerable circuits to 2% against AS-level adversaries, under 5% against colluding AS-level adversaries, and 25% against state-level adversaries. Additionally, Astoria balances the load across the Tor network to prevent overloading any set of relays.

## 1. Introduction
Tor is a widely used anonymity system that allows users to access the Internet anonymously or circumvent censorship [15]. Its growing popularity has made it a high-value target for blocking, denial of service (DoS) attacks [13, 29, 43], and traffic correlation attacks aimed at deanonymizing users [24, 25, 30, 31, 37]. Traffic correlation attacks, which link traffic entering and exiting the Tor network, are now being actively implemented by agencies like the NSA and GCHQ in collaboration with ISPs [3, 5, 7].

Traffic correlation attacks are feasible and practical for network-level attackers. Specifically, an AS can launch such an attack if it lies on both the path from the Tor client to the entry relay and the path from the exit relay to the destination. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential for these attacks [16, 18, 25], and proposed defenses include relay selection strategies to avoid ASes in a position to launch them [9]. However, recent work [41] has shown that these strategies perform poorly in practice.

The threat from network-level adversaries has been exacerbated by recent studies highlighting that the set of ASes capable of performing traffic correlation analysis is potentially much larger due to asymmetric routing, routing instabilities, and intentional manipulations of the Internet's routing system [39, 40]. These findings raise the bar for relay-selection systems, requiring them to accurately measure or predict network paths in both forward and reverse directions. Measuring the reverse path between two Internet hosts is non-trivial, especially when the client does not control the destination, as is common for popular web services. While solutions for measuring reverse paths have been proposed [27], they are not widely deployed or available.

In this paper, we make two key contributions:
1. We quantify the threat posed by these new attacks.
2. We develop a relay selection method to minimize their impact.

### Key Observations
- Up to 40% of circuits constructed by the current Tor client are vulnerable to network-level attackers.
- Up to 37% of all sites in our study, when loaded from Brazil, China, Germany, Spain, France, England, Iran, Italy, Russia, and the United States, had main page requests that were reached via a vulnerable path.
- Connections from China were found to be most vulnerable, with up to 86% of all Tor circuits and 56% of all main page requests to sites in the study being vulnerable to colluding network-level attackers.
- For up to 8% of the requests generated from China and Iran, over 95% of all possible Tor circuits were vulnerable to correlation attacks by network-level attackers.
- Reducing the number of entry guards increases the vulnerability of Tor circuits, with using a single guard significantly increasing the threat from traffic correlation attacks.
- State-level attackers can launch correlation attacks on up to 85% of all Tor circuits.

### Mitigating the Threat
We propose, construct, and evaluate Astoria, an AS-aware Tor client that includes security and relay bandwidth considerations when creating Tor circuits. Astoria is the first AS-aware Tor client to consider recently proposed asymmetric correlation attacks [39, 40]. When there are safe alternatives, Astoria avoids using circuits on which asymmetric correlation attacks might be launched. It also leverages methods for identifying sibling ASes [10] to determine the safety of a given circuit. In the absence of a safe path, Astoria uses a linear program to minimize the threat posed by any adversary. Finally, Astoria considers the bandwidth capabilities of relays while making AS-aware relay selection decisions. Despite selecting safer relays, Astoria distributes the load across Tor relays to avoid overloading any single set of relays.

## 2. Background and Motivation
### A. Tor Relay Selection
The Tor anonymity network consists of approximately 6,000 relays. Most requests are sent via a three-hop path known as a circuit, consisting of an entry, middle, and exit relay. The fundamental idea is that no single relay in the circuit learns both the source and destination.

Initially, Tor selected relays uniformly at random. This was changed to improve performance and security by preferring higher bandwidth relays [8, 11]. Today, relays may earn certain flags based on performance characteristics, such as reliability, bandwidth served, and uptime, making them preferential choices for various roles during circuit construction.

One such flag is the guard flag. New relays are monitored for stability and performance for up to eight days [4]. Stable and reliable relays are assigned a guard flag, allowing them to serve as entry relays. By default, the Tor client selects three guards to be used as entry relays for all circuits for a prolonged period. The main ideas behind this are:
1. To reduce the possibility that a client will select an entry and exit relay operated by the same entity.
2. To prevent attacker-owned entry relays from denying service to clients not using an exit relay owned by the attacker.
3. To increase the cost for an attacker to be chosen as an entry relay by requiring them to earn the guard flag [4].

Additionally, the Tor client requires that no two routers on a circuit share the same /16 subnet and no routers in the same family be chosen on the same circuit [8].

### B. Related Work
The threat of correlation attacks by AS-level adversaries on the Tor network was first identified and empirically evaluated by Feamster and Dingledine [18] in 2004, when the Tor network had only 33 relays. The study revealed that 10-30% of all circuits had a common AS that could observe both ends of the circuit. Murdoch and Danezis [30] and Murdoch and Zieliński [31] demonstrated that the threat from AS-level attackers was of practical concern. Edman and Syverson [16] found that the threat had not reduced despite revised relay selection strategies and a larger number of relays in the network.

Edman and Syverson [16] also considered threats from network-level attackers due to the asymmetric nature of Internet routing. Using the 2009 topology of the Internet, they found that up to 39% of all Tor circuits were vulnerable to network-level adversaries. Recent work by Vanbever et al. [40] and Sun et al. [39] highlights that an adversary on the reverse path can learn packet size and timing information via the TCP Acknowledgment (ACK) field, further complicating the issue.

A Tor circuit is vulnerable to a traffic correlation attack if there exists an AS \( A_i \) such that:
\[ A_i \in \{ p_{\text{src} \leftrightarrow \text{entry}} \cap p_{\text{exit} \leftrightarrow \text{dst}} \} \]

This condition means that the AS can observe both the forward and reverse paths of the circuit, enabling a traffic correlation attack.
