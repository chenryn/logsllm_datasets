It is already possible to use functions with lambda bodies as class
properties:
    class C {
        currentTime = () => Date.time();
    }
Perhaps they could also be used with getters and setters?
    class C {
        ..
        get currentTime = () => Date.time();
        set endTime = (time) => this.timer.setEndTime(time);
    }
_Edit_ : or using an even cleaner syntax suggested by @kitsonk
    class C {
        ..
        get currentTime() => Date.time();
        set endTime(time) => this.timer.setEndTime(time);
    }
Since getters and setters (especially getters) are frequently one-liners, this
may turn out to be a very handy feature.
I'm not sure whether ES6/7 already supports/plans to support this though, but
if this would turn out to make sense in general, perhaps they could consider
it as well?
