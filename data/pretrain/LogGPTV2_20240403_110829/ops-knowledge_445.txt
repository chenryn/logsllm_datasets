User: I am running command-line Python scripts from the Windows taskbar by having a shortcut pointing to the Python interpreter with the actual script as a parameter.
After the script has been processed, the interpreter terminates and the output window is closed which makes it impossible to read script output.
What is the most straightforward way to keep the interpreter window open until any key is pressed?
In batch files, one can end the script with pause. The closest thing to this I found in python is raw_input() which is sub-optimal because it requires pressing the return key (instead of any key).
Assistant: As to the "problem" of what key to press to close it, I (and thousands of others, I'm sure) simply use input("Press Enter to close").
