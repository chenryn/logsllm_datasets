Abstract—Online underground economy is an important chan-
nel that connects the merchants of illegal products and their
buyers, which is also constantly monitored by legal authorities. As
one common way for evasion, the merchants and buyers together
create a vocabulary of jargons (called “black keywords” in this
paper) to disguise the transaction (e.g., “smack” is one street
name for “heroin” [1]). Black keywords are often “unfriendly” to
the outsiders, which are created by either distorting the original
meaning of common words or tweaking other black keywords.
Understanding black keywords is of great importance to track
and disrupt the underground economy, but it is also prohibitively
difﬁcult: the investigators have to inﬁltrate the inner circle of
criminals to learn their meanings, a task both risky and time-
consuming.
In this paper, we make the ﬁrst attempt towards capturing
and understanding the ever-changing black keywords. We in-
vestigated the underground business promoted through blackhat
SEO (search engine optimization) and demonstrate that the black
keywords targeted by the SEOers can be discovered through a
fully automated approach. Our insights are two-fold: ﬁrst, the
pages indexed under black keywords are more likely to contain
malicious or fraudulent content (e.g., SEO pages) and alarmed
by off-the-shelf detectors; second, people tend to query multiple
similar black keywords to ﬁnd the merchandise. Therefore, we
could infer whether a search keyword is “black” by inspecting the
associated search results and then use the related search queries
to extend our ﬁndings. To this end, we built a system called
KDES (Keywords Detection and Expansion System), and applied
it to the search results of Baidu, China’s top search engine. So
far, we have already identiﬁed 478,879 black keywords which
were clustered under 1,522 core words based on text similarity.
We further extracted the information like emails, mobile phone
numbers and instant messenger IDs from the pages and domains
relevant to the underground business. Such information helps us
gain better understanding about the underground economy of
China in particular.
In addition, our work could help search engine vendors purify
the search results and disrupt the channel of the underground
market. Our co-authors from Baidu compared our results with
their blacklist, found many of them (e.g., long-tail and obfuscated
keywords) were not in it, and then added them to Baidu’s internal
blacklist.

I. INTRODUCTION
Assume one day you ask a person about the meaning of “溜
冰”, a Chinese word for “ice skating”. The answer will probably
be similar to the explanation given by a dictionary. But if asking
a merchant or a buyer of the underground economy, the answer
could be quite different. In fact, “ 溜冰” also means enjoying
methamphetamine, a very dangerous drug.
Underground economy, an online marketplace that facilitates
the transactions between merchants and buyers of illegal
products, has been continuously proliferating. The revenue
produced from the sales of the underground economy is
enormous [2] and disrupting this marketplace will deal great
damage to the criminal organizations hiding behind. A big
obstacle in tracing the underground economy is to understand
how the involved parties are communicating. To escape from
law enforcement, jargons referring to the products are invented
and added into the criminals’ vocabulary. The above example
suggests without a good reference, the chance of capturing a
jargon’s exact meaning is no more than a blind guess (similar
to learning Klingon, a constructed language in the ﬁctional
Star Trek universe, without reference to any dictionary).
Challenges and our solution. Currently, to ﬁnd and under-
stand those jargons, the primary approach is to inﬁltrate the
underground forum. Such approach is unscalable, when a large
of amount of threads have to be reviewed and the jargons are
tangled with many irrelevant texts. In this work, we explore
the direction of discovering the jargons related to underground
economy (called “black keywords” in this paper) through an
automated fashion, in attempt to provide the investigators
(or analysts) feed of black keywords and their context. This
problem is similar to Name-Entity Recognition (NER), an
area that has been advanced radically by many Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Yet, our problem
cannot be solved adequately by existing NLP techniques for
two main reasons. First, NER systems are domain-speciﬁc,
hard to adapt to a new domain where the vocabulary is very
different [3]. However, the vocabulary of black keywords is
rapidly evolved and differs signiﬁcantly from other commonly

used vocabularies. Second, many black keywords are created in
ungrammatical or even obfuscated forms (e.g., letter ‘l’ could
be replaced by digit ‘1’ in a word) while the NLP techniques
are suitable for well-written text [4].
On the other hand, based on our prior experience in
investigating underground economy, we found this challenge
can be addressed through a pure data-driven approach. Many
underground merchants rely on blackhat SEO (search engine
optimization) to promote their business. Usually, plenty of black
keywords are stuffed into one SEO page inside certain HTML
tags (e.g., anchor tags) to fool the search engines, yet making
themselves distinguishable under content analysis. We could
extract them from the SEO pages but the irrelevant texts have
to be pruned. It turns out that the search results associated with
a candidate keyword can be leveraged to determine whether
the keyword is “black”: as revealed by our study, querying
a black keyword usually returns multiple links alarmed by
the existing scanners, so we can use the result as the main
indicator. Additionally, we found our list of black keywords
can be extended through related search, a feature presented by
major search engines to correlate similar search terms based
on users’ searching behaviors. After these steps, a lot of black
keywords can be discovered, but a large portion of them are
long-tail keywords which contain words not of our interest (e.g.,
words except “heroin” in “where to buy heroin in Beijing”). To
extract the core words (e.g., “heroin” in the above example),
we devised a substring matching algorithm which can process
the keywords very efﬁciently.
We developed KDES (Keywords Detection and Expansion
System) and evaluated it on more than 2 million pages related
to SEO, porn and gambling. We discovered 478,879 black
keywords in total and extracted 1,522 core words (433,335
black keywords are covered). After sampling the detected
keywords, we found that the accuracy can achieve 94.3%,
suggesting KDES is effective. We applied our ﬁndings to Baidu
and the feedback was very encouraging. Many of the detected
keywords have been added into their internal blacklist.
Discoveries. Our study also sheds light on the underground
economy disguised under black keywords. We revealed the web
infrastructure supporting the underground market (mostly in
China) and unearthed contact information about the merchants
(6,620 phone numbers and 7,272 QQ numbers). We traced the
geo-locations of the phone numbers and found the merchants
are located widely across China (30 provinces of China with
at least 12 phone numbers each). The adversaries are able
to disseminate the black keywords into the results of major
search engines (e.g., Google, Bing and Baidu). Surprisingly, we
found that even search ads are tainted (under 17% core words),
which should have been rejected by human reviewers. While
our study focused on the communication channel established
upon blackhat SEO, other online channels, like Baidu Tieba (a
Chinese version of Reddit) and Zhidao (a Chinese version of
Quora), were also ramped (more than 200K spammed pages
detected for each) and the vocabularies are shared. Obfuscation
is performed as a method to conceal the sale message and
we have identiﬁed a list of transformation rules employed by
adversaries. In the end, we provide a study about the online
drug business based on our data. We identiﬁed several new
characteristics undocumented by previous works, including the
new hosting patterns and the new payment methods.
Contributions. We outline the contributions of this paper
below:
• Automated detection of new black keywords. We
retroﬁt the features from search engines (labels on search
results and related search) to discover black keywords
unknown to the public and extract the core words to ease
the review process of human analysts.
• Measurement and new ﬁndings. We revealed the back-
end infrastructure powering the underground economy
mainly in China, the parties involved and new keyword
transformation techniques used for evasion. In the mean-
time, the impact on search engines is also assessed.
• Reporting our discoveries. We collaborated with Baidu
and reported our result to their security team.
Roadmap. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section II provides background information of our study.
Section III elaborates the design of KDES. Section IV shows
the implementation and evaluation result. Section V shows
interesting discoveries of our study. In section VI we discuss
the limitations, dependencies and use cases regarding KDES.
Section VII reviews related work and Section VIII concludes
the paper.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we ﬁrst present an example regarding how
illegal products are promoted under black keywords. Then,
we describe the typical blackhat SEO techniques that can be
leveraged to promote sites unethically. Next, we describe the
related search feature utilized by our system. Finally, we discuss
the policies enforced by search engines.
Black keywords. To promote illegal products while circum-
venting the legal supervision, the underground merchants tend
to abuse the public channels of internet and disguise their
business intention under black keywords. Here we show one
example of such promotion under blackhat SEO (illustrated in
Figure 1). We assume the merchant is selling drugs (e.g., heroin)
in China and has created a shopping website (e.g., foo.drug). As
advertising such business is prohibited in China, the merchant
has to seek irregular channels, e.g., through poisoning the search
engine results. As such, the merchant coordinates with blackhat
SEOers and let them boost the ranking of foo.drug under
certain search keywords (i.e., black keywords), like “海洛因”
(Chinese word for heroin). The search engine companies usually
keep a close eye on keywords associated with illegal products,
therefore, the SEOers also target keywords that are pertinent
to “海洛因” but less monitored. To ﬁnd such keywords, the
SEOers either obfuscate the original keyword (e.g., “洛因” with
the ﬁrst Chinese character removed), or combine other words
to construct long-tail keywords [5] (e.g., “北京哪里买海洛
因” with the location term prepended to the original keyword).

These two methods are sometimes utilized together to make
the black keywords more elusive. Due to the gap between
machine and human in comprehending natural language, those
keywords are more likely to be ignored by the detector of search
engines but queried by the buyers. Therefore, they could ﬁnd
foo.drug in the results if the SEO campaign runs successfully.
Interestingly, because search engines often perform automated
transformation on search keywords (e.g., re-ordering words) to
offer more relevant search results [6], the sites promoted under
less used keywords could be merged with other frequently
queried keywords and seen by the users.
In this work, we consider all keywords pointing to illegal
products (e.g., drugs and ﬁrearms) and services (e.g., playbacks
of adult video) as the target our study, including the original
term, the obfuscated version and the long-tail version. With
off-the-shelf tools [7] available, long-tail keywords can be
generated. Unfortunately, these tools can only generate long-
tail keywords. The original terms of the long-tail keyword are
created and can only by created manually, without any rules
to follow. As such, our problem cannot be solved through
collecting and applying their tools.
We look into blackhat SEO activities as the data are easier to
crawl and we focus on China’s market as blackhat SEO is used
extensively by the underground economy there [8]. However,
we believe the similar situations also exist in other regions and
the black keywords are also prevalent in other channels (as
shown in Section V-D).
Blackhat SEO. SEO is a practice for one website to gain high
rankings in search results, in order to attract more web users.
Search engine companies recommend to improve website’s
structure and quality, but the blackhat SEO community does
not follow such guidelines and advocates abusing the resources
(e.g., outbound hyperlinks) of innocent sites (e.g., forums and
blogs) or colluding with other SEO sites to boost the search
rankings [9].
Our prior work revealed a new blackhat SEO infrastructure
(called spider pool) that has gained traction especially in
China [8]. More than 400K SEO sites have been discovered
and many underground merchants relied on this type of SEO
model to promote their business. In this work, we followed the
same methodology and have collected 2,733,728 spider pool
pages as the major source to study the phenomenon of black
keywords. Here we brieﬂy overview the model of spider pool.
Different from traditional blackhat SEO infrastructures,
spider pool mainly targets long-tail keywords that are less
competed by site owners. To reduce the operational cost,
blackhat SEOers often purchase cheap domains (e.g., expiring
domains) in bulk to set up SEO sites. The spider pool actively
traps the search crawlers and makes them visit the SEO sites
indeﬁnitely, and ﬁnally directs them to their customers’ sites.
There are two main techniques leveraged by spider pool to
avoid triggering alarms of search engines. First, wildcard DNS
is enabled on the SEO sites to create virtually inﬁnite sub-
domains to bypass the dead-loop detection performed by search
crawlers. Second, the SEO page is generated dynamically for
each crawler’s visit to evade the check of content plagiarism.
Built on top of these primitives, the customer’s site gets much
more frequent visits by search crawlers without improving site’s
quality and reputation. Besides customer’s sites, customer’s
message (e.g., “contact [phone number] to ﬁnd prostitute in
Beijing”) is also promoted by spider pool, through a technique
called site free-ride. Our work looks into the black keywords
correlated with both customer’s site and message.
Related search. People tend to try multiple times with modiﬁed
search terms when the search results do not meet
their
expectation. To save user’s time of typing new terms and to
guide the user to ﬁnd the correct terms, a feature called related
search is provided by major search engines like Google, Bing
and Baidu. Figure 2 shows an example of keywords prompted
by Baidu’s related search when a user queries “world war”.
Nine keywords are displayed, among which 8 contain the

multiple times for a single question/item and follow the
most accurate search result, the related search offers decent
opportunities in ﬁnding similar black keywords.
Search engine policies. Though the primary goal of search
engines is to make web pages universally accessible, there
are circumstances when they want to purify the search results.
Below we brieﬂy describe the policies established by popular
search engines, including Google, Bing and Baidu, on what
types of content are banned.
In the organic search result(The listings on search engine
results pages that appear because of their relevance to the search
terms), there are several categories considered as harmful by
the majority of search engines, like child sexual abuse imagery,
content infringing intellectual property, private information of
a person [11], [12]. The related search result is either removed
upon valid request or pruned automatically. In addition, search
engines follow the law of local government if they have local
versions. For example, Google removes the content that is at
issue under the local laws, e.g., “content that illegally gloriﬁes
the Nazi party on google.de” [13]. Another example is Baidu,
which more actively censors business content that violates
China’s law [14]. We learned from the security team of Baidu
that it keeps an internal blacklist covering underground business,
including bogus purchasing, ﬁnancial swindle, pornography,
lottery, bogus bank site and etc. Sites captured by the list are
removed automatically. Occasionally, Baidu prompts a warning
page or partially blocks the search results when a user queries
black keywords. As an example, Figure 3 shows Baidu’s search
results when a user queries “methamphetamine”. A special
warning is shown right above the ﬁrst search result.
The displayed ads within search results are also examined
(we introduce the background of search ads and the security
implications in in Appendix A). The banned categories tend
to be broader than those from organic search results. For
example, Google AdWords bans counterfeit and dangerous
product, inappropriate content and content enabling dishonest
behaviors [15]. Bing ads lists 17 categories about disallowed
content, product and services [16]. Baidu forbids products
violating nation’s law and requires licenses to be submitted for
certain business [17].
To summarize, the attitudes of search engines are consistent
against illegal content, or underground economy in particular 1,
though the concerned categories might be different slightly. In
fact, search engines do inspect black keywords and are striving
to purify the indexed pages under them, but their knowledge of
black keywords is lagged behind the underground communities.
We aim to bridge this gap and for this purpose, we develop a
novel system to harvest black keyword, which has been proved
to be highly valuable.
III. DESIGN
The ties between black keywords and underground economy
call for an effective detection system. In this section, we present

The main principle for implementing related search is
