underlined in red, with errors like:

In my project's root, I have a `jsconfig.json` file with the following
contents:
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "target": "ES6",
            "module": "commonjs"
        },
        "files": [
            "app/"
        ]
    }
The file in question lives inside the `app` folder.
