Car Wars (1835 - 1920) 
•
EVs predate ICE autos by 50 years 
•
1989 – EV is first to break 100 km/h (60 mph) barrier 
•
EVs outsold ICE autos 10 to 1 
The ICE Strikes Back (1910 - 2012) 
• Cheap oil 
• Electricity still limited and 
expensive 
• Growing rural population 
• 1914 - Ford chooses gas-
powered autos for motorized 
assembly line 
• 1930 - Electric tram networks 
bought out and dismantled by 
GM and Big Oil 
Return of the EV (1970 - 2012) 
• 1970s – Air pollution concerns and OPEC 
embargo  
• 1990 - 2003 – California Air Resources Board 
(CARB) mandates 
• 2008 – Tesla 
• 2010 – Nissan Leaf 
• 2011 – iMiEV 
EV Acronyms

Commuting 
• ~80% of US commutes are under 40 miles 
• No energy wasted sitting in traffic 
• Typical cost <= $0.02 / mile 
• High efficiency (MPGe) 
– Energy:  gasoline energy per gallon / Wh/m 
• 33.7 kWh / 280 Wh/m = 120 MPGe 
– Economic:  gas price / electric rate / Wh/m 
• $3.33 gallon / $0.08/kWh / 280 Wh/m = 149 MPGe

Charger 
Battery Pack 
• 10 x 29DC Marine Deep Cycle Batteries 
• 120 V 
• 15 kWh 
• 600 lbs  
Battery Pack Calculations 
• Range * wH/mile / 50% DOD / 60% Peukert 
• 15 * 300 / .3 = 15 kWh 
• Max range is 80% DOD 
• Lithium 
– No Peukert 
– 70% DOD nominal 
– 80% DOD for max

Lead Acid 
LiFePO4 
    Lead   
vs  Lithium(LiFePo4) 
• Lower upfront cost 
• Less sensitive 
• No balancing necessary 
• Easier to determine 
State of Charge (SOC) 
• Light-weight 
• Long cycle life 
• High power output 
• Less maintenance 
• Flat discharge curve 
• Better cold weather 
performance 
To BMS, or not… 
• Battery Management/Monitoring System required for 
some chemistries  
• Active or Passive monitoring 
• Distributed or Centralized 
• Expensive /complicated 
• Potential fire hazard 
Balancing 
• No two cells are identical 
• Cells must be balanced to prevent 
damage 
• Balancing matches cells at either top or 
bottom 
• If overcharged, cell is damaged 
• If overdischarged, cell can be pushed to 
reversal and destroyed 
Discharge curve and Half-pack Bridge 
• Monitor each half of pack 
• Take action if imbalance passes threshold 
Contactor, Precharge, & Coil Supression 
• Precharge Resistor 
– Prevents current surge 
– Preserves controller 
capacitors 
– Prolongs contact life 
• Coil Supression Diode 
– Prevents voltage spike 
– Usage depends on 
controller/contactor 
requirements 
Accessories 
• If needed, accessories may run off an 
auxiliary driveshaft, or be powered 
separately

WARNING:  EV Conversions are a very 
addictive/obsessive hobby.  The only way to 
‘finish’ a conversion is to start another.
