Question: A security team is tasked with protecting an organization's network against potential exploitation of software vulnerabilities within their office productivity suite. They are considering the implementation of application isolation and sandboxing, as well as exploit protection tools like Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG). Which of the following statements accurately reflect the considerations the team should make regarding these mitigation strategies?
"A": "While application isolation and sandboxing can mitigate the impact of exploitation, there may still be sandbox escape techniques that could be leveraged by an attacker.",
"B": "Exploit protection tools that monitor exploitation behavior, such as WDEG or EMET, are guaranteed to stop all attempts of software exploitation without any compatibility issues.",
"C": "Application isolation can completely eliminate the risk of client-side exploitation without the possibility of additional exploits being identified.",
"D": "Employing control flow integrity checking can potentially identify and prevent software exploits, but the effectiveness depends on the architecture and compatibility with the target application."
