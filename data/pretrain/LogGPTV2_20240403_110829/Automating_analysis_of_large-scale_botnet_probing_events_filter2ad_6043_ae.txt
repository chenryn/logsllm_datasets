Figure 11: A subset of the cluster of 36 events which all target
a same vulnerablity in SMB. The number on an edge labels the
percentage of bots sharing.
5.2 Event Correlation
We study the temporal and source (bot IP address) correlation
of different events. In this context, if we (cid:2)nd two events that have
more than 20% source addresses in common, we consider them as
correlated. We calculate the percentage of sharing as the maximum
of the shared addresses over total addresses of two events. We ob-
serve two types of interesting behavior:
Behavior 1: The botmasters ask the same botnet to scan the same
vulnerability repeatedly. In our two years of data, we (cid:2)nd several
event clusters that exhibit this behavior. For example, there is a
cluster of 36 events that occur every day, always scanning the same
SMB vulnerability. These events form a nearly complete clique,
i.e., each event shares (cid:21) 20% of the same source addresses in com-
mon with most of the other events. In Figure 11, we show a subset
of this commonality graph. These events on average share about
35% of the same sources. Each event occurs on a different day. We
speculate this activity re(cid:3)ects the botmaster commanding the same
botnet to re-scan the same address range repeatedly.
Behavior 2: The botmasters appear to ask most of the bots in a
botnet to focus on one vulnerability, while choosing a small sub-
set of the bots to test another vulnerability. Apart from these big
clusters, we (cid:2)nd there are some cases in which two events has very
high correlation (more than 80% of source address commonality),
and occur very close in time, usually the same day. We (cid:2)nd that
often the (cid:2)rst event is much larger in terms of the number of bots
than the second; the second is just a small subset of the bots from
the (cid:2)rst. This behavior illustrates that the dif(cid:2)culty of (cid:2)ngerprint-
ing botnet activity, given that botmasters may select a subset of bots
to assign to different tasks.
5.3 Property-Checking Results
Figure 12 shows the breakdown of the events along different
scanning dimensions. Six of the 203 events exhibit partial mono-
tonic trends; 16.3% re(cid:3)ect hit-lists; 80.3% follow the random-
uniform pattern, passing both uniformity and independence tests.
Through manual inspection of the partial monotonic events, we
(cid:2)nd that nearly half of the bots scan randomly and another half of

bots scan sequentially. All of these bots start to scan at almost the
same time. Perhaps they re(cid:3)ect two groups of bots controlled by the
same botmaster, and the botmaster asking these two groups to use
different scan strategies; but in general, this behavior is puzzling.
After that, we test the use of liveness-aware scanning (which we
term (cid:147)hit-lists(cid:148)). As mentioned above, we use (cid:18) (the ratio of the
number of senders in the darknet over to those of the live honeynet)
as the metric to classify the events. Out of the 106 events classi(cid:2)ed
by port number, 34 re(cid:3)ect hit-list scanning when using (cid:18) = 0:5. In
fact, all have empirical values for (cid:18)  0:5 have (cid:18) > 0:85. The 97 other events use popular ports also
seen in background radiation, and thus we have to classify them
based on application-level behavior. For these, we conservatively
assume that all the senders in the darknet using the same port num-
ber is possible members of the event, which tends to overestimate
(cid:18). For these 97 events, we did not (cid:2)nd any with small (cid:18) and most of
them have (cid:18) larger than one. We found in all the cases, the results
are insensitive to the threshold of (cid:18). In addition, none of the events
only target the darknet.

34 of the 197 random events fail the test for uniformity. We vi-
sually con(cid:2)rm that all of the remaining 163 events passing the test
indeed appear uniform. Three of those that failed appear uniform
visually, but have very large numbers of scans, for which the statis-
tical testing becomes stringent in the presence of a minor amount
of noise. In the remaining failed cases, we can see (cid:147)hot-spot(cid:148) ad-
dresses that clearly attract more activity than others; we do not
know why.
Finally, we test the 163 uniform cases for coordination, not (cid:2)nd-
ing any instances at a 0.5% signi(cid:2)cance level. In addition, we simu-
late the advanced botnet permutation scan (ABPS), and (cid:2)nd the de-
pendency test can accurately detect it even with 0% (cid:24) 20% packet
loss. Thus, none of the scanning we observe appears to re(cid:3)ect any
signi(cid:2)cant degree of coordination.
5.4 Extrapolation Evaluation and Validation
We validate two forms of global extrapolation(cid:151)global scan
scope and total number of bots(cid:151)using data from DShield [27], a
very large repository of scanning and attack reports.
Finding: 75% of our estimates of global scanning scope us-
ing only local data lie within a factor of 1.35 of estimates from
DShield’s global data, and all within a factor of 1.5.
Finding: 64% of bot population estimates are within 8% of rel-
ative errors from DShield’s global data, and all within 27% of rel-
ative errors
For 163 uniform events, 135 re(cid:3)ect independent uniform scan-
ning and 28 re(cid:3)ect hit-list scanning. For each type we estimate
either the total scanning ranges or the total size of the hit lists, re-
spectively. It is dif(cid:2)cult to verify hit-list extrapolations because of
the dif(cid:2)culty of assessing how the hit-list will align with sources
that report to DShield. However, we can validate extrapolations
from the (cid:2)rst class of events since we (cid:2)nd they usually target a large
address range. Due to limited data access to DShield, we have only
been able to verify 12 cases as of today, as shown in Table 6.
5.4.1 Global Scope Extrapolation and Validation.
Global scope extrapolation results: In Table 6, we show the ex-
trapolated scan scope we estimate from the local honeynet compar-
ing with the estimation we make with the DShield data. Column
ex. scope (I) shows the honeynet extrapolated scan scope by Ap-
proach I. Column DShield scope shows the DShield based estima-
tion. Column scope ratio gives the ratio of the honeynet extrapo-
lated scan scope by Approach I over the DShield scope. Column
ex. scope (II) shows the extrapolated scan scope by Approach II.
