User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Inbound traffic from ISP's DNS server My Symantec end point traffic logs keep showing that inbound UDP traffic from the DNS server is blocked. This happens every few minutes. Is it a potential attack?

Assistant: Probably it is a DOS attack.

Check the log carefully and verify the source IP of the request.

If it is a DOS attack,

the source IP's may look like
either

xxx.xxx.xxx.000
 For all entries
 Or

May be a group

xxx.xxx.xxx.000
xxx.xxx.xxx.001
xxx.xxx.xxx.002

Likewise

If you see random IP address repeatedly, it may be a DDOS attack.

Don't worry the Firewall will take care of it.

If it can't, either down the server by yourself or use a 302 temporary redirect

UPDATE


  The firewall is efficiently preventing it. If you want it not to come, Just add a 302 for 1 or 2 hours to google.com or something and then remove it.
