`issubset(x, y)` is incredibly slow with vectors of strings compared with the
equivalent `isempty(setdiff(x, y))`. This is because it uses `elt in y` rather
than building a dictionary/set. Of course, `issubset` can be made even faster
than `setdiff` when the result is `false` due to the possibility to short-
circuit when encountering an element which does not appear in `y`.
    julia> x = [@sprintf("id%010d", k) for k in 1:9999];
    julia> y = [@sprintf("id%010d", k) for k in 1:10000];
    julia> @time issubset(x, y)
      0.388715 seconds (10.00 k allocations: 156.391 KiB)
    true
    julia> @time isempty(setdiff(x, y))
