User: Please explain what a RESTful API is, and list the principles that need to be followed when designing it.
Assistant: RESTful API is a Web API built on the HTTP protocol. Its design idea is based on resources. Clients and servers interact through HTTP requests and responses. Clients can use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and resource URLs to call APIs. The design of RESTful API follows the following principles: 1. Resource-based: API design should be based on the concept of resources, which are represented by URLs. 2. Use HTTP methods: HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are used to define operations on resources, and the client calls the API through operations on resources. 3. State transition: The design of the API should define the operation process through the state transition, and the state change of the resource is indicated by the HTTP status code. 4. Stateless: The design of the API should prevent the server from saving the state information of the client. The client must carry the necessary state information to operate so that the server can understand the request. 5. Use HATEOAS: The design of the API should use hypermedia as part of the response, and the client discovers new resources by parsing the hypermedia. 6. Cacheability: API responses should be able to be cached to improve performance and scalability. 7. Layered system: APIs should be built on top of a layered system to support deployment and expansion at different levels. The above are the principles that need to be followed when designing a RESTful API. Following these principles can make the API simpler, more flexible, more scalable, and easier to maintain.
