kA,i = kB,i holds. The scheme can be transformed in the same way in a one-round scheme given a
one-round UKA as in the 1 out of n OT case in Section 4.
Similar as in the proof of Lemma 3.8, we argue that a malicious sender can tweak the output
distribution of (s0, s1). Due to the similarity, we only exhibit a brief version. Again we hardwire
a PRF key k for a PRF with a single output bit. Given mR, the malicious sender samples two
random tapes tS,1 and tS,2, computes for all i ∈ [2] (s0,i, s0,i) = fOT,S(tS,i, mR). If PRFk(s0,1, s1,1) =
0 output (s0,1, s1,1) and send mS,1 = fS(tS,1, mR) to R. Otherwise output (s0,2, s1,2) and send
mS,2 = fS(tS,2, mR) to R. This way, Prk(s0, s1) = 0 holds for the malicious sender’s output (s0, s1)

C All But One OT from Key Agreement
In this section we show how to use the techniques in Section 4 to construct an all but one, i.e.
n − 1 out of n, OT. We show the protocol in Figure 13 and give a state the achieved security
in Lemma C.1 without giving a detailed proof. Security follows from the same reasoning as in
Section 4.
Lemma C.1. Given a correct and secure UKA scheme, then the n − 1 out of n oblivious transfer
in Figure 13 is an Endemic OTn−1,n in the programmable random oracle model.
Proof. The proof is very similar to the security proof of the 1 out of n OT. In fact, the proof is
even simpler since the random oracle receives only a single r as input and for a malicious receiver,
37
distinguishing a single string, i.e. ki, needs to be hard. This even removes some of the complexity
of the previous proof. In the following, we state the claims, which only require minor adaptations
to the claims of the previous proofs. For this reason, we do not give their proofs here.
Security against a malicious sender follows by the claim below.
Claim C.2. Given a δ correct and  uniform UKA scheme, then it holds that in the programmable
random oracle model for any ppt adversary A, there exists a ppt adversary A’ such that for any
ppt distinguisher D and any polynomial size auxiliary input z
| Pr[D(z, (A, R)Π) = 1] − Pr[D(z, (A(cid:48),F S
OT)) = 1]| ≤  + (1 − δ),
where all algorithms receive input 1κ and R additionally receives input S.
By a second claim, the protocol is secure against a malicious receiver.
Claim C.3. Given a δ correct, Q-multi-instance u-uniform, (Q, 1)-multi-instance k-key-indistinguishable
UKA scheme, where Q upper bounds the amount of random oracle queries by an adversary then it
holds that in the programmable random oracle model for any ppt adversary A, there exists a ppt
adversary A’ such that for any ppt distinguisher D and any polynomial size auxiliary input z
| Pr[D(z, (S,A)Π) = 1] − Pr[D(z, (F R
OT,A(cid:48))) = 1]| ≤ u + k + (1 − δ),
where all algorithms receive input 1κ and adversary A’ rewinds A Q times.
D Instantiations
In the following, we ﬁrst show how to eﬃciently instantiate the construction in Figure 8 using
the Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange. In particular, we show how a tighter security reduction can be
obtained using the random self-reducibility of the DDH assumption.
In Figure 14, we give an
optimized variant based on an interactive DDH assumption.
Afterwards, we show how to instantiate the construction in Figure 8 based on the lattice based
Kyber key agreement.
We emphasize that the instantiations only achieve stand alone security. For UC security, one
needs to assume that CODDH and Kyber are secure against non-uniform adversaries. For the proof
of UC security against a malicious receiver, see Appendix E.
D.1 Instantiation from DDH
Deﬁnition D.1 (n-Multi-Instance DDH Assumption). For a group G, the decisional Diﬃe-Hellman
assumption is hard if for any ppt distinguisher D,
| Pr[D((cid:74)1(cid:75),(cid:74)(cid:126)a(cid:75),(cid:74)b(cid:75),(cid:74)(cid:126)ab(cid:75)) = 1] − Pr[D((cid:74)1(cid:75),(cid:74)(cid:126)a(cid:75),(cid:74)b(cid:75),(cid:74)(cid:126)c(cid:75)) = 1]| = negl,
p , b ← Zp and (cid:126)c ← Zn
p .
where (cid:126)a ← Zn
By a standard hybrid argument, n-multi-instance DDH is secure under the DDH assumption
with a security loss of n. In the following we show that the Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange is tightly
multi-instance secure under multi-instance DDH.
38
Lemma D.2. Let Q and n be polynomial in κ. The Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange over G is uncon-
ditionally Q-multi-instance uniform. Further, let the n-multi-instance DDH assumption hold over
group G except with advantage , then the Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange is one-round (Q, n)-multi-
instance key-indistinguishable except advantage  − negl.
Proof. The distribution of(cid:74)a(cid:75) over G is uniform, therefore
| Pr[DOA(1κ)(cid:75) = 1] − P r[DOu(1κ) = 1]| = 0,
even against an unbounded D. Hence, the Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange is unconditional Q-multi-
instance uniform.
For proving the second part of the lemma, we construct a ppt distinguisher D that breaks n-
multi-instance DDH assumption given a ppt distinguisher Dk that breaks the (Q, n)-multi-instance
key-indistinguishability of the Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange. D receives a challenge(cid:74)(cid:126)a(cid:75),(cid:74)b(cid:75),(cid:74)(cid:126)c(cid:75), sets
mB :=(cid:74)b(cid:75) and invokes Dk on input mB. On the j-th query of Dk to OA, D samples (cid:126)rj ← Zn+1
responds with mA,j :=(cid:74)(cid:104)((cid:126)a, 1), (cid:126)rj(cid:105)(cid:75) =(cid:74)a1(cid:75)· rj,1 +(cid:74)a2(cid:75)· rj,2 . . .(cid:74)an(cid:75)· rj,n +(cid:74)rj,n+1(cid:75). When Dk queries
Ok for key kj, D responds with kj :=(cid:74)(cid:104)(cid:126)c, (cid:126)rj(cid:105)(cid:75) =(cid:74)c1(cid:75) · rj,1 +(cid:74)c2(cid:75) · rj,2 . . .(cid:74)cn(cid:75) · rj,n +(cid:74)b(cid:75) · rj,n+1. In
It is easy to see that OA has the correct output distribution. rj,n+1 is uniform over Zp and hence
the end, D outputs the output of Dk.
and
p
mA,j is. Further, conditioned on mA,j, rj,1, . . . , rj,n are uniform. Given that (cid:126)c = (cid:126)ab, the output
kj =(cid:74)(cid:104)(cid:126)c, (cid:126)rj(cid:105)(cid:75) +(cid:74)b(cid:75) · rj,n+1 =(cid:74)(cid:104)(cid:126)ab, (cid:126)rj(cid:105)(cid:75) +(cid:74)b(cid:75) · rj,n+1 =(cid:74)(cid:104)((cid:126)a, 1), (cid:126)rj(cid:105)(cid:75) · b = mA,j · b
of Ok is also distributed correctly. In case that (cid:126)c is uniform, we need to show that all the n outputs
of Ok, (cid:126)k = k1, . . . , kn are uniform. Let mi be the message mA,j and (cid:126)ti the randomness (cid:126)rj that
corresponds to ki. Since (cid:126)c is uniform and (cid:126)k =(cid:74)(cid:126)c · T(cid:75), where T is the matrix with i-th column (cid:126)ti,
(cid:126)k is uniform if T is invertible. Since rj,1, . . . , rj,n are uniform given mA,j so is T . For a uniform T
over Zn×n
, the probability that T is invertible is that all the rows are linear independent, i.e.

(cid:19)n ≥ 1 − negl.
Therefore, except with negligible probability, D has the same advantage in breaking n-multi-instance
DDH as Dk has in breaking one-round (Q, n)-multi-instance key-indistinguishability.
Using Theorem 4.1 and Lemma D.2, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary D.3. When instantiating an 1 out of n OT in Figure 8 with Diﬃe-Hellman key ex-
change over group G, then in the programmable random oracle model the resulting endemic OT is
statistically secure against malicious senders and secure against malicious receivers except advan-
tage (n − 1)DDH + negl and a runing time loss Q, where the DDH assumption over group G holds
except advantage DDH and Q is a bound on the amount of adversarial random oracle queries.
Remark D.4. If we apply a hardcore predicate to kA and kB in the Diﬃe-Hellman key agreement
and apply the transformation Figure 8, we receive a one-round endemically secure OT in the random
oracle model based on the computational Diﬃe-Hellman assumption. Alternatively, one could also
use the random oracle instead of a hardcore predicate to obtain longer OT strings.
