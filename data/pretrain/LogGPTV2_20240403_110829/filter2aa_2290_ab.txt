After we realized why the grays died in the crash, we experimented with chemicals to 
make our soldiers ferocious. Nothing worked. They killed each other and everyone in 
sight, not just enemies. We’re getting there, though. Now we know that the fear of death 
or the fear of anything, really, is a function of protein clusters. Strathin, for example, a 
protein chain that effaces fear. We’re using it to create warriors who will do just about 
anything. Berserkers, we call them. In the past, we had to wait for their random 
appearance in a population. Now we make them. 
Berserkers are our version of guys willing to commit suicide. We hide the purpose in the 
concept of a “hero” and send them down a parade route off to war.  
The aliens knew how to make grays fearless when we were just learning to store data by 
making incisions in wet clay. Grays are the little guys with the big heads and big eyes 
that seem to hypnotize people (it’s really a kind of magnetic induction—their brains, like 
ours, are resonant with energies transmitted in fields, but they’re more intentional about 
it, and of course, their large designer brains do it better). 
Anyway, they made grays both with and without fear. The latter we called their suicide 
crashers, once we knew what they had done. The four small beings found dead or dying 
at the crash site had volunteered to die for the mission. They made it look like an accident 
because they knew that our species, barely sentient after a long preparatory sleepwalking 
sort of ascent, still thinks accidents happen. 
The Aliens knew our weapons were getting better, and our propulsion systems, 
communications, materials science, everything was leapfrogging ahead thanks to our 
frequent wars. They knew our science and saw that relatively soon, our practice would 
follow from our theories. We would become dangerous, maybe pose a threat to some of 
their allies. Even without their help, we would one day learn how to open portals and use 
them to slip through spacetime. It was implicit in our physics.   
They knew we would discover how they went into black holes and came out of white, 
how they could bunch up spacetime like a rug and bring it from there to here in a snap. 
They knew we would learn how to negate gravity and use arrays of lasers to create 
negative energy, then make black holes big enough to exploit. 
They decided they would lose little in the long run by accelerating our progress. They 
sacrificed a pawn to take a queen. They gave us the means of advancing faster along the 
road we were already traveling in exchange for direct access to our thinking.  
Imagine the scene.  The hole in the hillside, the remains of the wreckage sticking out, was 
still smoking. The perimeter had been secured. We had cover stories to give whoever 
7 
showed up related to whatever clearances they had so they could make sense of what they 
saw. 
It’s dark out there in the desert on a moonless night. We didn’t have night vision then – 
that was one of the technologies in the wreckage – and we didn’t want to light the place 
up like Times Square. Hundreds of workers on hands and knees with lights on their hats 
like miners scoured the site so everything would be gone by dawn. When they finished 
they brought in shovels and removed the top layers of contaminated sand, then molded 
the landscape back so no one could tell.  
Two grays were dead on the ground. One was nearly dead. The other was injured but 
alive.   
Our medics were useless. The transparent fluid circulating in their well-machined bodies 
was beyond our understanding. This is when we still thought that “natural” and 
“artificial” were meaningful distinctions, remember, that “made” and “born” meant 
different things. 
The third alien died in minutes. The forth was leaning on a rock, gasping for breath. It 
was suffocating but we didn’t know that, we didn’t know if the noises indicated pain or 
distress or whether it was trying to say something. As it turned out, it was all of the 
above. It knew that imitating our speech, making noises that carried in the air, that is,  
wouldn’t be intelligible, so the being reached out to the small circle of concerned 
personnel crouching around it with intense beams of electromagnetic energy. Everybody 
got headaches. They thought they inhaled something toxic.  But the gray was simply 
sweeping a shaped field through an arc to try to tell us that we had taken one or two steps 
in a journey of a thousand and were just beginning to climb from the vast cave of night 
into the starlight.   
When they were all dead, we shipped the bodies on different flights to Texas and Ohio. 
They were packed up and crated in the desert, not back at the base. All that nonsense 
about the mortician and the nurse, that’s crap. Those stories were part of a Loch Ness 
scenario, locals trying to create a tourist destination.  
The counter intelligence guy at the base was terrified when he read the message we told 
him to send, that one of those flying discs had crashed and we had the wreckage. He 
should have sent it with a “destroy” memo on a data page but was too freaked. So later I 
had to track them down and change “disc” to "weather balloon.” We amplified that into 
Project Mogul once we could.  
That’s not speculation. That happened. I know because I did it. 
Anyway, we had protocols for investigating crashes, first, of German, then Soviet planes. 
We collected everything and wiped out any traces that remained.  We transported all of 
the material in special containers for analysis and subsequent distribution. We put our 
clothing in special containers too. We seized material a rancher had gathered. We 
8 
rounded up witnesses and kept them in a room for hours. We threatened them with big 
fines and prison time if they said a word. We told them how traitors were discredited, 
their careers and reputations destroyed. We alluded to people who had disappeared, who 
turned up dead one day, victims of “sudden adult death syndrome.” Everyone signed a 
secrecy agreement with heavy penalties and then went home. 
We followed them out into the desert night. 
I have lived in that long desert night for sixty years. Dying made me see the light: the 
light is everything, everything that matters. Darkness is the enemy.  
I spent my entire life in that darkness. Now I must betray it.  
The small craft that crashed was not what they used for serious trips. Their mother ships 
are immense—some are half a mile long. They park them remotely and disguise them as 
space junk, just as we do with backup and killer satellites. But the little ship had plenty of 
treasure.  
Over time we fed everything into R&D. We were developing fronts and proprietaries 
then that made it easy. The President obliged by giving us carte blanche to do as we 
liked.  Money went to fake foundations with one or two members who transferred it to 
the Ford Foundation, say, or the Rockefeller Foundation or any of the hundred 
foundations that existed only on paper. Then it flowed onto balance sheets written with 
invisible ink, winding up in corporate and university labs. On the government side, we 
began budgeting black projects and millions of dollars, later billions, were hidden in 
existing missions.  Seeding projects was easy. Keeping secrets was easy. The problem 
was understanding what the stuff was, what it was good for. Some of it, we still don’t 
know. 
We didn’t have fiber optics, integrated circuits, networks of computers, don’t you see. 
We didn’t know that humans are electromagnetic systems for animating chemicals, that 
our brains can be tuned to wave functions to fly ships or fire weapons, make things move. 
We didn’t know that consciousness was non-local or that we could see anywhere we 
could think. 
We didn’t know then that sentience was everywhere, linking up. 
Do the research. Follow the money. See how historians say that microchips and lasers 
and super-tenacity fibers were invented. Map the process through a paper trail and 
computer files. Use FOIA, for heaven’s sake.  
It looks like everything really was invented here, doesn’t it? 
That’s what we did. We thought we were so damned smart.

When you’re dealing with alien civilizations and lack points of reference for how they 
think, how they construct reality, you don’t know how the pieces fit. There’s no picture 
on a puzzle box. We believed the event was the accidental crash of a small exploratory 
crew. 
The event, in fact, like everything else, was dual use. It served their purpose and ours at 
the same time. It was beautifully designed and executed. Let’s give them credit for that. 
The technological benefit to us was immense—they knew what we valued—but what we 
created had even greater value for them, for these species that had watched us for ages 
and watched again as we took their gifts and swarmed out of a dark cave like bats at 
twilight and colonized our solar system telerobotically with an aggressiveness they knew 
needed to be modified or managed.  
They couldn’t take any chances. They had to understand the mind of the whole hive.  
The military industrial complex—add education, entertainment, and the media to the 
mix—used those tools to build the Net. It was built for easy access, based on trust, as if 
built for a single tribe. But tribes also distrust one another, and as the Net became a 
platform for the whole planet, we exploited those attributes to create a capacity for 
ubiquitous surveillance, data mining, intrusion on a panoptic scale. With back doors in 
every system, space loaded with multi-spectral ever-open eyes, we had the whole world 
locked down. We were the smarty-cats that ate the canary. We were the top of the top of 
the food chain. We became complacent.  
We opened the gate and wheeled in the Trojan horse.  
We found technology in an “accidental crash” and used it to build the Net, just as they 
intended.  Then we did our thinking on the Net. We poured out the contents of our minds 
and psyches for everyone to see. Too late we realized what we had done, too late to 
disconnect mission-critical military and intelligence nets. But it wouldn’t have mattered if 
we had. Back doors were implicit in how we used the tools they gave us, how we had to 
use them, given what they were. Self-revelation is axiomatic to the architecture of the 
Net.  
We might as well have sat naked in our bedrooms, shivering in the dark, waiting for the 
doorknob handle to turn.   
We were patsies. We were playing a game that was way over our heads. 
They crashed so we would reverse engineer the technology we found. Did anyone 
wonder at the time why it was all intact?  No. The obvious is invisible. Obviously, if they 
had wanted to destroy the ship they would have wired it to explode. We never war-gamed 
a vehicle coming to us bearing technological puzzles tailor-made for the kinds of games 
we like to play.   
10 
So we built a platform onto which humankind projected the contents of its soul. Then 
anyone with access could understand us better than we understood ourselves. We 
revealed ourselves in embarrassing detail. No longer did our visitors have to sit in 
libraries, doing tedious research, or listen endlessly to mind-numbing sitcoms that taxed 
the limits of even their mission-specific brains. They did not have to go to any more 
cocktail parties and pretend to enjoy themselves while they took notes. 
We told them everything, everything about us. Now they know.  
And now, you know too. I swore I would never tell. But I am dying and my family is in 
hiding.  I want to shine a little light before the darkness swallows me up.  
Our only hope is to link up. They seduced us into building the Net. Now we must use it to 
transcend ourselves and transcend our former purpose and perhaps theirs. Something 
genuinely new can still come of all this.  
I know it’s hard for you to grasp how you were duped, how you have lived your lives in a 
maze you could never escape. You were hoodwinked, you were conned by the Masters 
who manage your planet, an elite that pretends to care for and tend you.  
But we too were conned. By diverse unnamable incomprehensible species from the stars.  
Once the shock diminishes, once you accept that you were betrayed, please trust each 
other even if you can’t trust us—and how could you, after what we did?  Please be 
motivated deeply by a thirst for revenge. Use that primitive gene to get back into the 
game.  
Maybe they planned this move too. Maybe they’re fifteen moves ahead. Maybe we play 
in four dimensions and they play in M-space. 
Who knows?   
Not me. I only know we have been deceiving you humplings with false stories for years. I 
didn’t know we were also deceiving ourselves. We said we did it for you, but in fact, we 
were drunk on power and needed control. Our goal was the social, economic and political 
control of the planet. You were expendable.  
I used you. I’m sorry. I knew what I was doing but I didn’t know the cost. 
So that’s the story. Roswell was a zero day and this is the moment of disclosure. But like 
most disclosure, it’s too late to do anything about it. The zero day is everywhere.  
We are owned.  
11 
But we can still make it work for us. Everything is dual use, as I said. They can’t play the 
game if we aren’t here. Hackers don’t crash the Net because then there wouldn’t be a 
game. The Net should have crashed many times but someone always stood it back up. 
Domain Name Servers are loaded with holes, but someone keeps patching them.  
Someone remotely administers the Earth from a mother ship in the Kuiper Belt.  
Someone wants us in the game.   
Perhaps you can use the hive mind we have created on the Net to lose and find 
yourselves, to self-transcend and play the game at the next level with a new handle on 
your altered identity.  
Do what you can.  That’s all I ask.  
We got you into this mess. It’s up to you to get us out.
