User: I am trying to access a MySQL database with python through Pydev Eclipse. I have installed the necessary files to access MysQL from python and I can access the database only when I write code in Python IDLE environment and run it from command prompt. However I am not able to run my applications from Pydev. 
when I use this "import MysqlDB"  i get an error, but in IDLE no errors and my code runs very smoothly.
Does anyone know were the problem is?
Thanks
Assistant: If the connector works in the IDLE but not in PyDev. Open Eclipse preferences, open PyDev directory and go to interpreter screen. Remove the interpreter and add it again from the location on your computer (Usually C drive). Close and reload Eclipse and now it should work.
