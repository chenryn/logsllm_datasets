### Issue with Using `expect` in a Bash Script for `ssh-copy-id`

#### Problem Description

I am trying to use an `expect` script within a Bash script to automate the `ssh-copy-id` process. The `expect` script is as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/expect <<EOL
spawn ssh-copy-id -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 111.111.111.111
expect "*?assword*"
send "thepassword\r"
interact
EOL
```

When I run this script, I get the following output:

```
spawn ssh-copy-id -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 111.111.111.111
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@111.111.111.111's password:
```

After running the script, I attempt to connect to the server, but I am still prompted for a password. Additionally, when I check the server, I find that no new SSH key has been added to the `authorized_keys` file. The contents of the `.ssh` directory on the server are:

```
root@server: ls /home/user/.ssh/
known_hosts
```

#### Analysis

The issue appears to be that the `ssh` client is reading the password directly from the terminal, rather than from the `expect` script. This means that the `send` command in the `expect` script is not being recognized by the `ssh` client.

#### Solution

One effective way to work around this issue is to use the `sshpass` utility, which allows you to provide the password non-interactively. Hereâ€™s how you can modify your script to use `sshpass`:

1. **Install `sshpass`** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install sshpass  # For Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo yum install sshpass      # For CentOS/RHEL
   ```

2. **Modify the Bash script** to use `sshpass`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   sshpass -p "thepassword" ssh-copy-id -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@111.111.111.111
   ```

This approach should allow you to automate the `ssh-copy-id` process without the need for `expect`.
