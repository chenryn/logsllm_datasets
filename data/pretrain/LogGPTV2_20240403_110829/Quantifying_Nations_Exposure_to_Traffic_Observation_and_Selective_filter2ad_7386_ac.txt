Cuba’s remaining ASes declines rapidly (81% from the top-ranked AS to the
second).
4 Note that multiple ASes may provide transit connectivity to the same preﬁxes,
explaining why the sum of CTI values of top ASes may be greater than 1.
5 This is consistent with previous work that focused exclusively on Cuba, ﬁnding its
international connectivity to be constrained [16].
Quantifying Nations’ Exposure to Traﬃc Observation

Countries Around the Median. The median of the leftmost bar in Fig. 3
consists of countries that are still considerably exposed to observation and tam-
pering, with CTI values ranging from 0.34 to 0.44, including: Egypt, Equatorial
Guinea, Belize and Thailand. In Eq. Guinea, the top-two ASes each have a CTI
over 0.3; these ASes have a p2c relationship with each other. Egypt and Belize
have more skewed distributions, with a 67–79% decline from the top AS to its
successor.
Least Exposed Countries. At the other end of the spectrum in Fig. 4 are
ﬁve countries where the top-ranked has CTI values under 0.2: Chad, Bangladesh,
Belarus, Turkey and North Macedonia. These countries have ﬂatter distributions,
with CTI declining at most 21% (or 16% on average) between the top-two ASes.
As a result, we ﬁnd no evidence of these nations being particularly exposed to
a single network (unlike most of their peer countries in our sample). India, the
country with the most Internet users in our sample, is in the bottom third with
a top-AS CTI of 0.29, declining by 27% between the top-2 ASes.
Frequently Top-Ranked ASes. Of the 165 ASes present in Fig. 3, 126 of
them are in the top-5 for only one country, with a further 31 ASes in the top-5
of at most 10 countries. There are eight notable exceptions, however: 3356*-
Lumen6 (top-5 in 25 countries), 1299*-Telia (24), 174*-Cogent (24), 6939-HE
(18), 5511*-Orange (16), 6762*-T. Italia (14), 23520-C&W (14), and 6453*-Tata
(12). Nearly all of these networks (marked with *) are in the inferred clique at
the top of the global transit hierarchy [1]. C&W is only present in our analysis
for countries in the Caribbean. HE has a very broad footprint, with countries in
Africa (7), the Mid. East (3), W. Europe (2), Southeast Asia (2), South Paciﬁc
(2) and East/South Asia (1 each).
5.2 Submarine Cable Operators
Submarine cables are known to be an important part of the global Internet
infrastructure [15,29,45] and play a role in the top-5 ASes of most countries we
study. (Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Guyana are the only three nations where
none of the top-5 ASes are associated with the submarine cables landing in the
country.)
In this section, for each country, we ﬁnd the highest-ranked AS by CTI where
there is evidence of an institutional connection between the AS and an owner or
operator of a submarine cable. We deﬁne an AS as a submarine cable operator
if we ﬁnd a direct match between the AS Name, the AS Organization [20], or
a corporate parent organization (e.g., CenturyLink for Level3, the Government
of Sierra Leone for Sierra Leone Cable Company) and the owners of a subma-
rine cable operator according to TeleGeography [64] and Infrapedia [38]. This
process yields submarine cable ASes in 46 countries out of 51 possible, as 17
of the 75 countries are landlocked, and 7 have no submarine cable connectivity
according to the operator databases. In three additional countries (Myanmar [4],
the Solomon Islands [10], and Congo DRC [43]) only TeleGeography provides an
6 Formerly Level3/CenturyLink.

AS to submarine cable match, which we conﬁrm with information from the
cited sources (the operators themselves, the government of Australia, and a sub-
marine cable news source). In the remaining two countries (Thailand [65] and
Samoa [63]) where we were not able to ﬁnd an AS to submarine cable from
TeleGeography, we rely on the cited sources (from the operator and a Samoan
news outlet) to ﬁnd a match. Note that only operators of submarine cables who
appear as an AS on the BGP path can be identiﬁed using this method.

Fig. 5. Orange circles: CTI of top-ranked submarine cable AS. Blue bars: CTI rank of
top-ranked submarine cable AS. (Color ﬁgure online)
Our ﬁndings are shown in Fig. 5, with the CTI of the top cable-owning AS
in each of the 51 countries shown as orange circles, and the ordinal ranking of
that AS in its country’s ecosystem as blue bars. In 36 countries, a submarine
cable AS is ranked at the top by CTI, with an average rank of 1.9.
Note that being the top operator by CTI means diﬀerent things in diﬀerent
countries, as the underlying potential exposure to observation aﬀects the CTI
of the top AS. For instance, in Turkey a cable-owning AS ranks ﬁrst by CTI,
but has the lowest CTI among such countries. Said AS (9121-Turk Telecom)
has a CTI of 0.17. By contrast, in Cuba and Libya, a submarine cable operator
(11960-ETECSA and 37558-LIT) is also ranked ﬁrst but with CTIs of 0.96 in
both cases. As a result, Turkey is much less exposed to a single AS than Cuba
and Libya.
We also ﬁnd regional clusters of high transit inﬂuence for the same AS oper-
ating a submarine cable, including C&W (formerly Columbus Networks), which
is among the top providers in 11 countries in Central America and the Caribbean
thanks to its ownership of the ECFS, ARCOS-1 and Fibralink cables. Telecom
Italia Sparkle, Telefonica and Bharti Airtel also have an important transit pres-
ence in the Mediterranean, Latin America, and South Asia respectively. We
release a complete list of submarine cables linked to an AS with high CTI on
the paper’s repository.
5.3 State-Owned Transit Providers
In more than a third (26) of nations, we ﬁnd that at least one of the top-5
ASes is state-owned, motivating us to further examine the total inﬂuence of a
Quantifying Nations’ Exposure to Traﬃc Observation
657
country’s government on its Internet connectivity. In particular, we adapt CTI
to quantify the inﬂuence of state-owned conglomerates—as some nations have
more than one state-owned AS—and apply it to the 75 countries in our sample.
We use as input a list of ASes that are majority-owned by sovereign states [23].
The list was manually veriﬁed and encompasses both access and transit ASes.
The dataset includes major telecommunication providers as well as its sibling
networks and subsidiaries. Using this list, we ﬁnd 100 state-owned ASes who
operate domestically (i.e., where the state owner and the country of operation
are the same) in 41 countries.
Fig. 6. CTI and fraction of addresses originated by domestic, state-owned ASes in our
study.
Inﬂuence of State-Owned ASes. Our initial exploration of the inﬂuence of
state-owned ASes concerns the role each AS plays in the ecosystem of its country,
as shown in Fig. 6. We ﬁnd that state-owned ASes tend to provide either transit
or access, usually not a combination of both. (Most points in Fig. 6 line up
along an axis, rather than towards the middle.) As a consequence, meaningfully
estimating the footprint of the state requires combining the two kinds of inﬂuence
as well as aggregating data for AS conglomerates. (Two exceptions where a state-
owned AS provides both Internet access (i.e., as an origin AS) and serves transit
to other ASes are Cameroon and Egypt; in the former, Camtel has both a high
CTI (0.44, ranked ﬁrst) and originates 27% of the country’s addresses (second
only to Orange Cameroon). Egypt’s TE has a CTI of 0.37 and originates 28%
of the country’s addresses.)
We begin our combined estimation by computing CTI for not just a single
AS, but a set of ASes, while not “double counting” inﬂuence over the same
addresses; i.e., if two of the state’s ASes originate and provide transit to the
same addresses, we add those addresses to the state’s footprint once. We call this
derived metric CT In. Intuitively, CT In reﬂects the “pure-transit” footprint of
the state, crediting only the addresses where state-owned ASes serve exclusively
as transit providers. For instance, if AS A and AS B (both of which operate
in country C) respectively originate and provide transit to the same /24 preﬁx,
CT In says that the conglomerate SC = {A, B} does not have transit inﬂuence
over the /24 preﬁx. Formally, CT InM (Sc, C) ∈ [0, 1] is calculated as

which is essentially identical to Eq. 1, except that Sc is a set containing all of the

AS in Sc; and d∗(Sc, m, p) = minASt∈Sc
d(ASt, m, p), i.e., the AS-level distance
from p to the closest AS in the conglomerate.
Finally, we deﬁne the total footprint of the state, i.e., addresses that are
either originated or for which transit is served by a state-owned AS. The state’s
footprint F (C) ∈ [0, 1] is calculated as
F (C) = CT InM (Sc, C) +

where a∗(ASo, C)/A(C) is the fraction of addresses in country C originated by

is the addresses directly originated by the state-owned conglomerate Sc.

(orange bars), CT In (blue bars), and
Findings. Figure 7 shows our ﬁndings for the state-owned footprint (F , bar
height), the originated fraction by state-owned ASes (orange bar), and pure-
transit footprint of state-owned ASes (CT In, blue bar). Our results suggest
that domestic state inﬂuence exists on a spectrum where some countries, such
as Ethiopia, Cuba, Libya and Yemen, rely overwhelmingly on the state for the
provision of Internet access and (F between 0.90–0.97), whereas others, such as
Colombia, Turkey, Mongolia and Ecuador have relatively marginal state-owned
enterprises (F between 0.01–0.12).
Regarding the mode of inﬂuence that states use, in many countries in Fig. 7,
most of the bar height is contributed by the orange portion, meaning that the
footprint of the state comes from addresses directly originated. However, in some
countries the state punches above its access network weight by deploying an
inﬂuential transit provider, i.e., those where the bar height is not dominated by
the origin contribution in orange.

Pure-Transit Footprint of State-Owned ASes. The countries where pure-
transit inﬂuence (CT In) is largest (0.2 or more, or pure-transit inﬂuence over
at least a ﬁfth of the country’s addresses) are shown in Table 1. In these coun-
tries, all of which are in Africa and Central Asia, providing transit considerably
increases the inﬂuence of the state. We note that the mere existence of these
inﬂuential transit ASes does not signal willingness of the state to engage in
surveillance or selective tampering, but rather that the government may have
opportunities to do so. For instance, Myanmar’s state-owned Myanma Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT), which is included in our analysis, appears to have
been involved in the disruption of the country’s Internet service during the recent
coup [36].
6 Inferring Transit Dominance
In this section, we describe how we identiﬁed the 75 countries that are the
focus of the preceding section, i.e., countries where provider-customer transit
(p2c) relationships are likely the dominant mode of inbound international con-
nectivity. We start by identifying countries for which public datasets of Internet
Exchange Points (IXPs) and Private Colocation facilities (Colo) show no evi-
dence of international peering (Sect. 6.1). Based on this analysis, we conduct an
active measurement campaign to conﬁrm the absence of international peering
(Sect. 6.2). This second stage based on traceroutes is necessary because peering
datasets are incomplete, particularly when it comes to membership lists at IXPs
in developing countries [47]. We consider the prevalence of transit links being
used to reach each of our target countries from probes distributed worldwide
(Sect. 6.3) in combination with our operator validation (Sect. 7) to select a set
of transit-dominant countries.
We deﬁne international peering as a (logical) link between two ASes that: (i)
operate primarily in diﬀerent countries (Sect. 3), and (ii) where that link is not
an inferred transit-customer link. We use this deﬁnition since we are interested
in studying the AS-level routes taken towards each country. We are aware of the
limitations of our measurements and analysis, particularly with regards to the
location (both topologically and geographically) of our probes; we address the
issue further in Sect. 8.
6.1 Constructing a Candidate List
We identify countries where international peering may not be prevalent by eval-
uating evidence of international peering involving origin ASes present in the
