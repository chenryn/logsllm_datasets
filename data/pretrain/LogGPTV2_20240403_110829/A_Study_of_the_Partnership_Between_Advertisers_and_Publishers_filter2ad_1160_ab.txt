3.1 Similarity or Dissimilarity Between Publishers and Advertisers
What Categories of Publishers are Paired with the Most Advertis-
ers? Data analysis reveals that no matter what category of advertiser websites,
59.9% advertisers have their ads displayed on publisher websites falling under
the 5 categories, including News and Media, Computers and Technology, TV
Movies and Streaming, Social Networks & Online Communities, and Arts
and Entertainment, as shown in Fig. 2. And the publishers under the other
5 categories, including Games, E-commerce & Shopping, Adult, Coupons and
Rebates, and Sports, are also popular ad placement choices, which account for
22.2% combined.
We further examined why publishers in these 10 categories are delivered with
the most ads (assuming that the more advertisers associated with a publisher,
the more ads delivered to it), by looking into the number of visits to those
publishers in the last 6 months. We found that 7 out of the top 10 most popular
publisher categories are among the top 10 categories with the most visitors,
shown in Fig. 3. Although the rest 3 categories – Games, Coupons and Rebates,

and Sports – did not appear in Fig. 3, actually the publishers in those three
categories also attract huge volume of user traﬃc. Thus, the results indicate
that visitor traﬃc does positively aﬀect the number of ads that are delivered to
a publisher website.
Do Ad Networks Deliver an Advertiser’s Ads to Publishers with the
Same Category as the Advertiser? We analyzed the leading publishers that
are associated with each of advertisers in all 30 categories, and found that a
third of advertisers end up with their ads mostly shown on publishers with
the same category as them. Figure 4 shows the top 10 categories of advertisers
with their ads mostly shown on publishers with the same category. We can
see that up to 66.9% Adult advertisers have their ads mostly shown on Adult
publishers, 35.6% Games advertisers mainly showing ads on Games publishers, and
17.5% Gambling advertisers showing ads on Gambling publishers7. The results
are reasonable, since the visitors to a publisher would highly likely show interest
in the advertised products or services from advertisers of the same category as
the publisher.
For the rest 20 advertiser categories, 13 categories of advertisers dis-
play ads mostly on News and Media publishers; advertisers in the other
7 categories mainly have their ads delivered by ad networks to publish-
ers in categories: Computers and Technology, Social Networks and Online
Communities, and Adult. As depicted in Fig. 3, all those four publisher cat-
egories, i.e., News and Media, Computers and Technology, Social Networks
and Online Communities, and Adult, are among the top 10 categories with the
most visits in the last 6 months, so the ads on them could get more exposure.
7 Note that 17.5% is already a very large ratio, given the quite small ratio of Gambling
publishers among all publishers on the Internet. In our dataset, only 1.4% domains
fall into the Gambling category.

So, we conclude that ad networks deliver an advertiser’s ads either to publishers
with the same category as the advertiser or to publishers with a large volume of
visitor traﬃc.
Fig. 5. Percentage of advertisers in the top 20 countries whose ads are displayed mostly
on publishers from the same country.
Do Ad Networks Deliver an Advertiser’s Ads to Publishers in the
Same Country as the Advertiser? As shown in Fig. 10, the top 20 coun-
tries account for 88.5% of all websites in our dataset, and we focus on those
20 countries. For each country, we compute the proportion of advertisers which
have their ads mainly shown on publishers from the same country. The results
are illustrated in Fig. 5. It shows that in all 20 countries, a signiﬁcant pro-
portion of advertisers (from 29.3% to 80.0%, 50.7% on average) have most of
their ads delivered to publishers from their own country. In the top 6 countries,
including United States, Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Poland, more than 60%
A Study of the Partnership Between Advertisers and Publishers
573
advertisers and their corresponding leading publishers are from the same country.
One may argue that the conclusion is quite obvious and expected, but we believe
that it is still worth a quantitative measurement.
The 6 rightmost countries in Fig. 5 are the only exceptions, since in those
countries, advertisers have their ads delivered to the United States publishers
more often than to publishers in their own country. Speciﬁcally, 58.1% advertisers
from Canada, 48.6% from Korea, 45.5% from Australia, 43.2% from India, 48%
from Mexico, and 37.9% from China are scheduled by ad networks to show ads
mainly on the United States publishers. Publishers from the United States
seem very popular with worldwide advertisers. In all other 12 out of the top 20
countries (also excluding United States itself and Ukraine), United States
publishers come second in hosting their ads. This probably reﬂects the prefer-
ence of advertisers, since ad networks do allow advertisers to decide their target
countries.
Do Ad Networks Pair an Advertiser with Publishers with Higher-
Volume Traﬃc than the Advertiser? We compared between publishers and
advertisers in our dataset in traﬃc volume. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the boxplot
chart shows that advertisers have much fewer visits than publishers in terms of
the total visits in the recent 6 months. Speciﬁcally, on average, within a 6-month
time period, an advertiser website receives 45.3 million visits, and a publisher
website receives 3.59 billion visits, about 79 times of the traﬃc to advertisers.
The median visits to them are 5.18 million and 27 million, respectively. Hence,
statistically, advertisers’ ads are more likely to be displayed on publishers with
higher user traﬃc than that of advertisers. The result makes sense considering
that ads displayed on a publisher with high-volume traﬃc could get more atten-
tion of potential customers and thus bring a great return on investment (ROI)
for advertisers.

Do Ad Networks Pair Advertisers with the Right Publishers? We
explored this question by checking whether an advertiser’s audiences will highly
likely visit its leading publishers. We match an advertiser’s top audience inter-
ests against the categories of its top 5 publishers. A matching would indicate
574
W. Ma and H. Xu
an advertiser’s ads are indeed delivered to the right publishers. Among 11,961
advertisers with both top audience interests and leading publishers information
available, 79.6% advertisers have their audience interests matching with the cor-
responding publishers. The result suggests that ad networks may do a good job
in pairing advertisers and publisher but still have much room for improvement.
3.2 Advertisers’ Preference on Ad Networks
Ad networks play a crucial role in online advertising ecosystem. Next, we would
like to examine which ad networks are popular with advertisers when they con-
sider launching an ad campaign.
Top 20 Most Popular Ad Networks. A total number of 199 unique ad net-
works are identiﬁed in our dataset. Figure 7 shows the top 20 most popular
ad networks and the percentage of advertisers choosing them. Google Display
Network is clearly the dominant ad network, and accounts for 23.6% of advertis-
ers’ ad network choices. Skimlinks comes second and is chosen by 9.5% adver-
tisers. All other 197 ad networks, including those not shown in the ﬁgure, only
attract a share of less than 5% advertisers.
Fig. 7. Top 20 popular ad networks with advertisers.
Number of Ad Networks Adopted by an Advertiser. It is possible that an
advertiser partners with multiple ad networks for its ad campaigns. Data analysis
reveals that (1) 41.8% advertisers only adopt one ad network, and 52.2% of those
advertisers adopt Google Display Network only and 10.2% choose Skimlinks
only, (2) 19.5% advertisers partner with two ad networks, and one of the two ad
networks takes the largest share, accounting for 81.1% ads on average, (3) 10.8%
advertisers with 3 ad networks, and one of those ad networks account for 73.0%
ads on average, (4) 6.8% with 4 ad networks, and one of them accounts for 68.1%
ads on average, and (5) 21.1% with at least 5 ad networks (since we can only
see the top 5 leading ad networks), and one ad network accounts for 61% ads
A Study of the Partnership Between Advertisers and Publishers

on average. So, only 41.8% advertisers stick to only one advertiser, which has a
52.2% chance to be Google Display Network . For those advertisers partnering
with more than one ad network, one of the ad networks take the largest share,
often responsible for more than 60% ads.
Most Popular Ad Networks for Advertisers with Diﬀerent Categories.
We then checked if the advertisers under diﬀerent categories have diﬀerent pref-
erences on ad networks. We found that Google Display Network is the number
one choice for advertisers in 29 out of the total 30 categories, with the category
Adult as the only exception. We use a pie chart8 in Fig. 8 to show the major ad
networks preferred by Adult advertisers. It shows that exoClick, PopCash, and
AdSupply are the 3 most popular ad networks with Adult advertisers, account-
ing for 15.5%, 9%, and 9%, respectively. Note that although these 3 ad networks
are among the top 20 popular ad networks with all categories of advertisers in
Fig. 7, none of them get a share of more than 2%, which implies that these ad
networks focus their business on Adult advertisers.
Fig. 8. Ad networks preferred by Adult advertisers.
How Much Traﬃc is Driven by Advertising to Advertisers’ Websites?
Lastly, we check how large proportion of traﬃc that advertising could bring
about to an advertiser’s site. Our dataset contains the traﬃc source information
for all 26,456 unique websites under all 30 categories. Figure 11 (in Appendix
due to page limit) shows the average proportion of the incoming traﬃc that
arises from advertising by category. We can see that statistically, for advertisers
in any category, the traﬃc due to advertising occupies less than 10%, which is
quite normal because a website could have quite diverse traﬃc sources, includ-
ing but not limited to search (Google, Bing, etc.), direct (bookmark, type-in),
and social (Twitter, Facebook, etc.), and also even 8.7% traﬃc from advertising
(i.e., for Adult advertisers) would cost advertisers a big amount of money. Speciﬁ-
cally, advertisers in the three categories: Adult, Romance & Relationships, and
Gambling rely on advertising to attract visitors more than website in any other
categories. On average, about 5.6% to 8.7% visitors navigate to those websites

form of pie chart for better illustration.

through advertising. It makes sense since after all those websites cannot attract
as much traﬃc as News and Media websites in the normal way.
Limitations. This study is based on a small dataset with potential bias.
4 Related Work
Our work represents a new eﬀort towards increasing transparency into the com-
plex online advertising ecosystem. There is a large body of work studying the
other aspects of the online advertising ecosystem. Gill et al. [22] investigated the
relationship between personal information collected and its economic value for
advertising. Papadopoulos et al. [32] implemented a system to allow end users
to compute in real time the value advertisers pay to reach them. Some works
[8–10,28] studied the ad targeting mechanisms. Liu et al. [28] investigated the
prevalence of three primary ad targeting mechanisms and found that behavioral-
based targeting was the most popular one. Barford et al. [10] characterized a large
corpus of ads and studied the ad targeting mechanisms from various perspectives.
Andreou et al. [8] reported that some advertisers target users with ads of poten-
tially sensitive categories such as politics and religion. Some other works studied
new forms of advertising. Chalermsook et al. [18] studied a new form of advertis-
ing, i.e., sponsored viral marketing. Yu et al. [41] studied in-vehicle advertising
and its economic impact. A couple of works studied the newly introduced mech-
anisms or standards. Pachilakis et al. [31] conducted a measurement study of
Header Bidding (HB), an advanced method of programmatic ad buying. Bashir
et al. [11] presented a 15-month observational study of the ads.txt standard. A
few works [24,25] studied the impact of the usage of ad-block and anti-adblock
tools on the advertising ecosystem. Compared to the above-mentioned works,
we study the online advertising ecosystem with a unique dataset and from the
perspective of advertisers.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we study the practice of pairing between advertisers and publishers
as well as advertisers’ preference on ad networks from the perspective of adver-
tisers, with a unique dataset collected from a leading website analytics service.
Our study produces ample ﬁndings which oﬀer advertisers additional insights
into the complex advertising ecosystem and help guide their ad campaigns.
