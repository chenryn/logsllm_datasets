# A Study of the Partnership Between Advertisers and Publishers

## 1. Introduction
This study examines the relationship between advertisers and publishers, focusing on the categories of publishers that attract the most advertisers, the similarity or dissimilarity between publishers and advertisers, and the preferences of advertisers for different ad networks.

## 2. Top 10 Categories with the Most Publishers

### 3.1 Similarity or Dissimilarity Between Publishers and Advertisers

#### 3.1.1 What Categories of Publishers are Paired with the Most Advertisers?
Data analysis reveals that 59.9% of advertisers have their ads displayed on publisher websites in the following five categories: News and Media, Computers and Technology, TV Movies and Streaming, Social Networks & Online Communities, and Arts and Entertainment (see Fig. 2). Additionally, publishers in the categories of Games, E-commerce & Shopping, Adult, Coupons and Rebates, and Sports are also popular choices, accounting for 22.2% combined.

To understand why these 10 categories are the most popular, we examined the number of visits to these publishers over the last six months. We found that 7 out of the top 10 most popular publisher categories are among the top 10 categories with the most visitors (Fig. 3). Although the remaining three categories—Games, Coupons and Rebates, and Sports—did not appear in Fig. 3, they still attract a significant volume of user traffic. This indicates that visitor traffic positively affects the number of ads delivered to a publisher's website.

#### 3.1.2 Do Ad Networks Deliver an Advertiser’s Ads to Publishers with the Same Category as the Advertiser?
We analyzed the leading publishers associated with each advertiser in all 30 categories and found that about one-third of advertisers have their ads mostly shown on publishers in the same category. **Figure 4** shows the top 10 categories of advertisers whose ads are mostly shown on publishers in the same category. For example, 66.9% of Adult advertisers have their ads primarily shown on Adult publishers, 35.6% of Games advertisers show ads on Games publishers, and 17.5% of Gambling advertisers show ads on Gambling publishers. This is reasonable because visitors to a publisher are likely to be interested in products or services from advertisers in the same category.

For the remaining 20 advertiser categories, 13 categories of advertisers display ads mostly on News and Media publishers, while advertisers in the other 7 categories mainly have their ads delivered by ad networks to publishers in the categories of Computers and Technology, Social Networks and Online Communities, and Adult. These four publisher categories are among the top 10 with the most visits in the last six months, ensuring higher exposure for the ads.

#### 3.1.3 Do Ad Networks Deliver an Advertiser’s Ads to Publishers in the Same Country as the Advertiser?
**Figure 5** illustrates the percentage of advertisers in the top 20 countries whose ads are displayed mostly on publishers from the same country. In all 20 countries, a significant proportion of advertisers (from 29.3% to 80.0%, with an average of 50.7%) have most of their ads delivered to publishers from their own country. In the top 6 countries, including the United States, Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Poland, more than 60% of advertisers and their corresponding leading publishers are from the same country.

**Figure 5.** Percentage of advertisers in the top 20 countries whose ads are displayed mostly on publishers from the same country.

However, in six countries, advertisers have their ads delivered more often to U.S. publishers than to publishers in their own country. Specifically, 58.1% of Canadian advertisers, 48.6% of Korean advertisers, 45.5% of Australian advertisers, 43.2% of Indian advertisers, 48% of Mexican advertisers, and 37.9% of Chinese advertisers have their ads primarily shown on U.S. publishers. This reflects the global preference for U.S. publishers, which come second in hosting ads for 12 out of the top 20 countries (excluding the U.S. and Ukraine).

#### 3.1.4 Do Ad Networks Pair an Advertiser with Publishers with Higher-Volume Traffic than the Advertiser?
We compared the traffic volume between advertisers and publishers in our dataset. **Figure 6** shows that, on average, within a six-month period, an advertiser website receives 45.3 million visits, while a publisher website receives 3.59 billion visits, about 79 times the traffic to advertisers. The median visits are 5.18 million for advertisers and 27 million for publishers. Therefore, statistically, advertisers' ads are more likely to be displayed on publishers with higher user traffic, which can bring a greater return on investment (ROI) for advertisers.

#### 3.1.5 Do Ad Networks Pair Advertisers with the Right Publishers?
We explored whether an advertiser's audiences are likely to visit its leading publishers by matching an advertiser's top audience interests against the categories of its top 5 publishers. Among 11,961 advertisers with both top audience interests and leading publishers information available, 79.6% have their audience interests matching with the corresponding publishers. This suggests that ad networks generally do a good job in pairing advertisers and publishers but still have room for improvement.

### 3.2 Advertisers’ Preference on Ad Networks

#### 3.2.1 Top 20 Most Popular Ad Networks
A total of 199 unique ad networks were identified in our dataset. **Figure 7** shows the top 20 most popular ad networks and the percentage of advertisers choosing them. Google Display Network is the dominant ad network, accounting for 23.6% of advertisers' choices. Skimlinks comes second, chosen by 9.5% of advertisers. All other ad networks, including those not shown in the figure, attract less than 5% of advertisers.

#### 3.2.2 Number of Ad Networks Adopted by an Advertiser
Data analysis reveals that:
- 41.8% of advertisers only adopt one ad network, with 52.2% of these choosing Google Display Network and 10.2% choosing Skimlinks.
- 19.5% of advertisers partner with two ad networks, with one of the two networks accounting for 81.1% of ads on average.
- 10.8% of advertisers use three ad networks, with one network accounting for 73.0% of ads on average.
- 6.8% of advertisers use four ad networks, with one network accounting for 68.1% of ads on average.
- 21.1% of advertisers use at least five ad networks, with one network accounting for 61% of ads on average.

#### 3.2.3 Most Popular Ad Networks for Advertisers with Different Categories
Google Display Network is the top choice for advertisers in 29 out of the 30 categories, with the Adult category being the exception. **Figure 8** shows the major ad networks preferred by Adult advertisers, with exoClick, PopCash, and AdSupply being the most popular, accounting for 15.5%, 9%, and 9%, respectively.

#### 3.2.4 How Much Traffic is Driven by Advertising to Advertisers’ Websites?
Finally, we checked the proportion of traffic driven by advertising to advertisers' sites. **Figure 11** (in Appendix) shows the average proportion of incoming traffic from advertising by category. Statistically, for advertisers in any category, the traffic due to advertising is less than 10%. Specifically, advertisers in the categories of Adult, Romance & Relationships, and Gambling rely more on advertising to attract visitors, with 5.6% to 8.7% of their traffic coming from advertising.

## 4. Related Work
Our work contributes to increasing transparency in the complex online advertising ecosystem. Previous studies have focused on various aspects, such as the economic value of personal information [22], real-time computation of ad value [32], ad targeting mechanisms [8–10, 28], new forms of advertising [18, 41], and the impact of ad-blocking tools [24, 25]. Our study provides unique insights from the perspective of advertisers.

## 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we studied the practice of pairing between advertisers and publishers and advertisers' preferences for ad networks using a unique dataset. Our findings offer valuable insights into the complex advertising ecosystem and can help guide advertisers' ad campaigns.
