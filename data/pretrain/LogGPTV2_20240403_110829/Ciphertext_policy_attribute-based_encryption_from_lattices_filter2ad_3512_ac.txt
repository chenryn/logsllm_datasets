# Lattice-Based Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme

## 1. Introduction
In this paper, we present two constructions for a lattice-based ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme. The ciphertext policy we achieved is based on AND-gates over multi-valued attributes. Future work will focus on achieving more complex access structures.

## 2. Decryption Process
### 2.1 Decryption Algorithm
Given a ciphertext \( C \) encrypted under a policy \( W \), the decryption process is as follows:

1. **Input:**
   - Public parameters \( P \)
   - Ciphertext \( C \)
   - Set of attributes \( L \)

2. **Check Policy Satisfaction:**
   - If \( L \) satisfies the policy \( W \) (i.e., \( L \models W \)), proceed with the following steps:
     - Compute \( w \leftarrow c_0 - e^T \cdot \mathbf{c} \).
     - Check if \( |w - \lfloor q/2 \rfloor| < t \).

3. **Reconstruct Private Key:**
   - For each \( v_{i,j} \in L \) where \( i \geq t \):
     - Compute \( B \leftarrow q \cdot (F_t \cdot (R_{t,j})^{-1}) \) for \( j \in [N_t] \) and \( j \neq j^* \).
     - Use the BasisDelegation algorithm to generate a basis \( T_L \) for the lattice \( \Lambda^\perp \).
     - Sample a basis \( T_{t,j} \) using the SamplePre algorithm.
     - Generate the private key \( e_L \) as \( e_L \leftarrow \text{SamplePre}(F_L, T_L, u, \sigma) \).

4. **Challenge Phase:**
   - Adversary \( A \) sends a message bit \( b^* \in \{0, 1\} \).
   - Construct the challenge ciphertext \( C^* \) encrypted under the access structure \( W^* \) as follows:
     - \( F_{W^*} = A \cdot \prod_{v_{i,j} \in W^*} (R_{i,j})^{-1} \).
     - \( F_{W^*} = A_0 \cdot R_{N,j^*}^{-1} \cdot \ldots \cdot R_{1,j^*}^{-1} \cdot \prod_{v_{i,j} \in W^*} (R_{i,j})^{-1} \).
     - \( F_{W^*} = A_0 \).

## 3. Conclusions
We have presented two constructions for a lattice-based CP-ABE scheme. The ciphertext policy we achieved is based on AND-gates over multi-valued attributes. Future work will focus on achieving more complex access structures.
