#### Old 3DS (Released starting 2011)
- **CPU**: 2x ARM11 MPCore (268 MHz)
- **GPU**: DMP PICA
- **RAM**: 128MB FCRAM, 6MB VRAM
- **IO/Security CPU**: ARM946
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Hardware-based compatibility with DS games
- **Operating System**: Fully custom microkernel-based OS

## 3DS Hardware Overview

### Main Components
- **ARM9 CPU**: Handles system-level tasks and has access to almost all hardware components.
- **ARM11 CPU**: Runs applications and has more limited access to hardware.
- **FCRAM**: Fast Cycle RAM used for general-purpose memory.
- **WRAM**: Working RAM.
- **VRAM**: Video RAM.
- **GPU**: Graphics Processing Unit.
- **CRYPTO**: Cryptographic processor.
- **NAND**: Non-volatile storage.

### Memory Regions
- **APPLICATION**: Memory region for running applications.
- **SYSTEM**: Memory region for system processes.
- **BASE**: Base memory region.

### ARM11 Microkernel Architecture
- **Home Menu**: User interface for accessing applications.
- **NS (Network Services)**: Manages network-related tasks.
- **fs (File System)**: Manages file operations.
- **GSP (Graphics Service Processor)**: Handles graphics processing.
- **HID (Human Interface Device)**: Manages input devices.
- **System Calls**: Interfaces for interacting with the kernel.

### Service Access Control
- **am:sys**: System management service.
- **fs:USER**: File system access for user-mode applications.
- **hid:USER**: Input device access for user-mode applications.
- **gsp::Gpu**: GPU access.
- **pxi:am9**: Communication between ARM9 and ARM11.

## Anatomy of a 3DS "Jailbreak"

### Steps to Achieve Code Execution
1. **Compromise a User-Mode Game or App**: Exploit a vulnerability in a game or application.
2. **Escalate Privilege**: Expand the attack surface by gaining higher privileges.
3. **Compromise ARM11 Kernel**: Gain control over the ARM11 kernel.
4. **Compromise ARM9**: Gain control over the ARM9 CPU.

### Previous 3DS Entry Points

#### Cubic Ninja
- **Vulnerable Custom Level Parser**: Levels can be shared via QR codes.
- **Lack of Security Features**: No ASLR, no stack cookies, making file format bugs exploitable.

#### Web Browsers
- **Built-in Browser**: The 3DS has a built-in web browser.
- **Security Features**: ASLR and stack cookies are present but have not stopped browser exploits.
- **Threat Model**: Assume compromised user-mode.

#### mcopy
- **SMBv1 Protocol**: Used for file sharing.
- **Fuzzing**: A bug-finding strategy involving random data input to find vulnerabilities.
- **Tool Used**: github.com/miketeo/pysmb
- **Adjustments**: Code adjustments were made to make it compatible with mcopy.
- **Fuzzing Code**: Added 6 lines of fuzzing code.

### Attacking mcopy
- **Fuzzer**: Tool used to generate random inputs.
- **3DS**: Target device.
- **Protocol Requests and Responses**:
  - **Negotiate Protocol Request**
  - **NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE Request**
  - **Negotiate Protocol Response**
  - **NTLMSSP_AUTH Request**
  - **NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE Response**

### Initial Fuzz Crash Analysis
- **Wireshark Trace**: Network traffic analysis.
- **Protocol Diagram**: Visual representation of the SMB protocol exchange.
- **Packet Details**: Detailed breakdown of the SMB packet structure.

### Normal Packet Structure
- **SMB Magic Number**: Identifies the SMB protocol.
- **SMB Command**: Specifies the type of command (e.g., Sessions Setup AndX).
- **Security Blob Size**: Size of the security blob.
- **Username Data Descriptor**: Describes the username data.
- **Username Data**: Actual username data.
