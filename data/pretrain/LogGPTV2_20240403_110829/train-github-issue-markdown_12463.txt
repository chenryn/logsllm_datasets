There's a playground snippet showing the issue here: http://is.gd/tYeNHE
Here's the gist:
    use std::collections;
    static VERSION: &'static str = "rustc 0.13.0-dev (77cd5cc54 2014-12-07 19:02:18 +0000)";
    fn main() {
        let r = {
            // this works fine
            let d = collections::HashMap::new();
            d.insert("foo", "bar");
            // this doesn't
            type Header = collections::HashMap>; 
            let x = Header::new();
        };
        println!("{}", r)
    }
