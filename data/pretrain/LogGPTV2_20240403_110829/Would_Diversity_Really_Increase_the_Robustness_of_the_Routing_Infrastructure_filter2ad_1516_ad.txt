work. Table 3 compares the robustness of the Tier-1 ISP
using the original coloring, with the robustness achieved us-
ing the Basic Partition and Extended Partition algorithms.
Since there are eight colors in the original coloring, we set
the number of available colors for the Basic Partition al-
gorithm to eight and allow any router to select any of the
colors. For the Extended Partition algorithm we need two
sets of colors: one for the backbone nodes and one for the
access nodes. We observe that, among the eight implemen-
tations in the original coloring, only two are used for back-
bone routers. Therefore, we allow the Extended Partition
algorithm to use two colors for backbone routers and six
colors for access routers.
We observe that the original coloring has bad minimum
robustness when the color failure affects one of the colors
used by the backbone routers. Both Partition algorithms
achieve improved average and minimum robustness by dis-
tributing the available diversity better throughout the net-
work. This is specially signiﬁcant for minimum robust-
ness, achieving values much closer to the average robust-
ness. The Extended Partition algorithm shows worse mini-
mum robustness than the Basic Partition algorithm, since it
has an additional constraint that routers can only use imple-
mentations adapted to their role. But this constraint is more
realistic for Tier-1 ISP networks, where the role separation
of backbone and access routers becomes evident.
Figure 6 shows the degree of diversity needed to achieve
a certain level of robustness in the Tier-1 ISP topology using
the Extended Partition algorithm. From the total number of
colors shown in the x-axis, two colors are always used for
the backbone routers and the rest used for the access routers.
The results show that two colors are enough to guarantee the
robustness of the backbone, given the existing amount of re-
dundancy. This is shown as a good average robustness with
any number of access colors. It also shows that we start to
achieve good overall robustness (e.g., minimum robustness
≥ 0.5 and average robustness ≥ 0.75) when we use at least
3 colors for the access routers, that is with a total of 5 colors.
To conclude, we observe that the original Tier-1 network
has a signiﬁcant amount of diversity, but the diversity is not
best used to maximize robustness against color failures. Us-
ing a realistic coloring algorithm such as Extended Parti-
tion, we can achieve a signiﬁcant increase in the robustness
of the topology against color failures, by redistributing the
diversity, without increasing the amount of implementations
used in the network.

Zhang et al. [33] ﬁrst proposed the use of diversity to
increase the survivability of a network, inserting diver-
sity at each level of the networking stack. More recently,
O’Donnell et al. [25] studied the problem of how to use
diversity to limit the spread of malware on a network topol-
ogy. O’Donnell et al. assume that each node runs mul-
tiple implementations and takes an online decision, in a
distributed fashion, of which implementation to use at any
given time.
In our case, nodes run a single implementa-
tion and network operators select in a centralized and ofﬂine
manner, using our coloring algorithms, which implementa-
tion each node should run from the set of available imple-
mentations. Junqueira et al. [17,18] propose to use diversity
in a cooperative backup system to protect against correlated
host failures due to software vulnerabilities. Their results
on distributed systems are analogous to ours on routing in-

frastructure in that they show that diversity is common and
can be exploited for increased resiliency.
Previous work on network robustness has focused on the
Internet topology. Albert et al. [10] showed that scale-free
networks are resilient to random faults but vulnerable to at-
tacks that target the most connected nodes. Park et al. [27]
studied the susceptibility of the Internet to a mixture of ran-
dom faults and attacks. Magoni [22] studied the Internet ro-
bustness to attacks ﬁnding that the removal of a few nodes
could signiﬁcantly damage the Internet’s connectivity but
such an attack would be costly to mount. Li et al. [20] raised
concerns about the application of power laws to the router-
level Internet topology. Markopoulou et al. [23] classiﬁed
the different network faults from a Tier-1 ISP network and
found that 12% of all faults were router-related problems.
There has been extensive work on the connectivity of
the Internet and generally in identifying graph connectivity
metrics [10,26,27,29,32]. Several node importance metrics
have also been proposed [14, 20, 24, 30]. Finally, there is
also research work on graph partitioning. Wu and Huber-
man [31] use a voltage ranker to ﬁnd clusters while Karypis
and Kumar [19] use a k-way multi-level approach to parti-
tion hypergraphs. We use both algorithms in this paper to
compare the differences between clustering and partitioning
algorithms.
7 Discussion
In this section we present extensions to our work that we
are currently testing, other foreseeable applications for our
approach and some future work.
External connections: ISPs need to route their customer’s
trafﬁc to the rest of the Internet. For all destinations not di-
rectly connected to the ISP network, this means forwarding
the trafﬁc to another ISP, either an upstream provider or a
peer. In order for the network to remain functioning upon a
color failure, we need to ensure that there is at least one ex-
ternal connection in each partition when a color fails. With
the Partition algorithm, we can apriori ﬁx nodes in differ-
ent regions, and the partitioning will try to keep those nodes
in the speciﬁed regions. We use this property to ﬁx border
routers in different partitions.
Robustness beyond connectivity: In this paper we have
limited our analysis to the connectivity of the network, be-
cause connectivity is the fundamental property that needs
to be guaranteed for the network to be functional. Once
we address connectivity, we can study the impact on higher
layers. Clearly, the disconnection of a large number of
routers impacts the routing and the end-to-end quality of
service and might introduce higher CPU load on the re-
maining routers, packet loss increments due to congestion
on the remaining links, or an increase in end-to-end delay
due to longer paths. We leave the study of these effects on
the higher layers as future work.
Robustness beyond color failures: There is a need to de-
velop a general framework to measure network robustness,
that encompasses any type of failure and any kind of im-
pact. Such a framework would allow us to predict the im-
pact of failures and to understand the effect of a proposed
local change (e.g., add or remove a router or a link) on the
global network robustness. In this paper we have presented
a ﬁrst step towards that framework by studying the network
robustness under simultaneous router failures. This is a
worst case scenario because it involves simultaneous and
geographically disperse node failures. This type of failures
are infrequent but have great impact. In our future work we
plan to extend our approach to handle more frequent failures
with more limited impact.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we have shown that diversity does increase
the robustness of the routing infrastructure against simulta-
neous router failures, by answering three fundamental ques-
tions. First, we have presented how to measure the robust-
ness of the network when faced with a color failure, using
connectivity and robustness metrics that capture the impact
of a node failure and its effect on the rest of the topology.
Second, we have shown that a small degree of diversity in
the network can provide good robustness against simulta-
neous router failures. A large Tier-1 ISP network can ob-
tain good robustness when using a total of ﬁve implementa-
tions: two for the backbone routers and three for the access
routers. The amount of diversity needed is small because
our proposed coloring algorithms maximize the beneﬁts of
the available diversity. We observe that the best way of ap-
plying diversity is to partition the network into contiguous
regions that use the same implementation, taking into ac-
count the node roles and possibly replicated nodes. Finally,
we expose that large networks might already have enough
diversity, since the homogeneity is due to a large fraction of
the nodes using a small number of implementations, even
when the total number of implementations present might be
large. Thus, the existing diversity is not being adequately
used for robustness. To beneﬁt from the available imple-
mentations, ISPs would need to change the relative num-
ber of nodes per implementation and to geographically dis-
tribute the diversity. When using the same number of im-
plementations currently available in a Tier-1 ISP network
we can increase the number of nodes in the largest compo-
nent from 5% to at least 76% in the worst case.
