### SUDO and Time Manipulation

SUDO uses OS Clock Ticks to measure time, which means you cannot roll back the system clock to bypass the sudo password check timeout. The `sudoers` file includes a `timestamp_timeout=X` setting that defines how long the sudo password remains valid.

Similarly, the `uptime` command also relies on the system's clock ticks to determine the system's uptime.

### Incident Response and Log Analysis

Incident response becomes particularly challenging when logs show unusual sequences of events, such as:

- **Nov 18 13:45:43 important-server:** Hacker logs out
- **Nov 18 13:46:54 important-server:** Hacker performs l33t hack
- **Nov 18 13:47:47 important-server:** Hacker logs in

This can indicate time manipulation or the use of cron jobs to set the system clock to a random time. Moving the system clock forward can cause log files to roll over and be purged, especially if there is no central logging system in place.

### Physical Access and GPS Spoofing

If you have physical access to the data center roof, you can manipulate the GPS signal to control the system's time. Here are some methods:

1. **GPS Unit with Aerial on Roof:**
   - Connect a GPS unit with an aerial on the roof.
   - Use a serial connection to send GPS data to the server.
   - Attach a transmitter to the wire with an attenuator to control the signal strength.

2. **Server Configuration:**
   - Configure the server to use the GPS data from `/dev/gps0` and `/dev/pps0`.
   - Use the NTP daemon (ntpd) to synchronize the system time with the GPS data.

### NMEA Data and PPS Signal

NMEA data is used to provide precise time and location information. The Pulse Per Second (PPS) signal indicates the start of each second and is highly accurate, often within microseconds or nanoseconds.

### NTP Setup and Spoofing

To spoof the PPS signal, you can:

1. **Raspberry Pi with GPS Receiver:**
   - Run NTPd on a Raspberry Pi.
   - Connect the GPS receiver to the GPIO pins.
   - Use one wire for the PPS signal.

2. **Spoofing PPS:**
   - Link the PPS pin to another GPIO pin and set it high and low as needed.
   - If the PPS timing is manipulated, the NMEA data will correct the time, keeping it within ±1 second.

### NMEAdesync Tool

To further manipulate the NMEA data, the `NMEAdesync` tool can be used. This tool, available on GitHub, allows for more control over the NMEA data and PPS generation. It replicates the NMEA data and adjusts the time and the speed of a second.

### GPSnitch for Detection

`GPSnitch` is a tool designed to detect GPS signal spoofing. It monitors the time offset, SNR values, and other parameters to identify potential spoofing attempts. The tool was discussed in detail at Unrestcon 2016, and the slides and code are available on ZX Security’s site and GitHub.

### NTP Server Best Practices

To avoid GPS spoofing, consider the following best practices for NTP setups:

1. **Multiple Upstream Servers:**
   - Use at least three upstream servers.
   - Include different types of upstream servers (e.g., GPS, atomic).
   - Avoid relying solely on GPS-based servers.

2. **Air-Gapped Networks:**
   - Consider using atomic, caesium, or rubidium clocks for air-gapped networks.

3. **Additional Logging and User Prompts:**
   - Implement additional logging for when the NTP daemon shuts down due to a time jump.
   - Prompt the user to accept a large time jump when the daemon restarts.
