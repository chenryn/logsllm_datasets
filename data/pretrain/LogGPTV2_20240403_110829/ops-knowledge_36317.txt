User: Please guide how to find and replace specific text in a file using Linux command line.
Assistant: You can use the sed command in Linux to find and replace specific text in a file. Here's an example: Suppose you want to replace "old text" with "new text" in a document. You can enter on the command line: ``` sed -i 's/old text/new text/g' filename.txt ``` Among them: - -i means to modify directly in the original file. Without -i, the original file will not be changed, but the modified result will be printed to the terminal. - 's/old text/new text/g' is the replacement pattern for the sed command. Where: - s means "replace". - /old text/ is the text to replace. - /new text/ is the text to replace with. -g means global replacement. You can replace "filename.txt" with the filename you want to find and replace. This is a relatively simple example. The usage of the sed command is very rich, which can meet your needs for processing different requirements in files. You can also check the documentation of the sed command for more usage.
