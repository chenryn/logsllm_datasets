.sh name
repertoiremap \- map symbolic character names to unicode code points
.sh description
a repertoire map defines mappings between symbolic character names
(mnemonics) and unicode code points when compiling a locale with
.br localedef (1).
using a repertoire map is optional, it is needed only when symbolic
names are used instead of now preferred unicode code points.
.ss syntax
the repertoiremap file starts with a header that may consist of the
following keywords:
.tp
.i comment_char
is followed by a character that will be used as the
comment character for the rest of the file.
it defaults to the number sign (#).
.tp
.i escape_char
is followed by a character that should be used as the escape character
for the rest of the file to mark characters that should be interpreted
in a special way.
it defaults to the backslash (\e).
.pp
the mapping section starts with the keyword
.i charids
in the first column.
.pp
the mapping lines have the following form:
.tp
.i   comment
this defines exactly one mapping,
.i comment
being optional.
.pp
the mapping section ends with the string
.ir "end charids" .
.sh files
.tp
.i /usr/share/i18n/repertoiremaps
usual default repertoire map path.
.sh conforming to
posix.2.
.sh notes
repertoire maps are deprecated in favor of unicode code points.
.sh examples
a mnemonic for the euro sign can be defined as follows:
.pp
.nf
  euro sign

.br query_module ()

.sh versions
this system call is present on linux only up until kernel 2.4;
it was removed in linux 2.6.
.\" removed in linux 2.5.48

.sh notes
some of the information that was formerly available via
.br query_module ()
can be obtained from
.ir /proc/modules ,
.ir /proc/kallsyms ,
and the files under the directory
.ir /sys/module .
.pp
the
.br query_module ()
system call is not supported by glibc.
no declaration is provided in glibc headers, but,
through a quirk of history, glibc does export an abi for this system call.
therefore, in order to employ this system call,
it is sufficient to manually declare the interface in your code;
alternatively, you can invoke the system call using
.br syscall (2).

.sh name
arp \- linux arp kernel module.
.sh description
this kernel protocol module implements the address resolution
protocol defined in rfc\ 826.
it is used to convert between layer2 hardware addresses
and ipv4 protocol addresses on directly connected networks.
the user normally doesn't interact directly with this module except to
configure it;
instead it provides a service for other protocols in the kernel.
.pp
a user process can receive arp packets by using
.br packet (7)
sockets.
there is also a mechanism for managing the arp cache
in user-space by using
.br netlink (7)
sockets.
the arp table can also be controlled via
.br ioctl (2)
on any
.b af_inet
socket.
.pp
the arp module maintains a cache of mappings between hardware addresses
and protocol addresses.
the cache has a limited size so old and less
frequently used entries are garbage-collected.
entries which are marked
as permanent are never deleted by the garbage-collector.
the cache can
be directly manipulated by the use of ioctls and its behavior can be
tuned by the
.i /proc
interfaces described below.
.pp
when there is no positive feedback for an existing mapping after some
