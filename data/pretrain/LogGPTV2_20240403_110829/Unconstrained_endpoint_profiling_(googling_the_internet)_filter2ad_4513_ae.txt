given characteristic. The insights from Table 7 are as follows.
First, browsing along with a combination of browsing and chat
or browsing and mail seems to be the most common behavior glob-
ally. Another interesting result is that gaming users typically do
not engage in any other activity on the Internet. Indeed, gaming
users are clustered in a separate group of their own in all scenarios.
Likewise, Asian users show a much higher interest in Internet gam-
ing relative to other regions. This is not a big surprise given the
known popularity of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing
Games (MMORPG) in Asia [3, 4]. Finally, it is worth noting that
p2p users do engage in other online activities such as browsing and
chat globally albeit in varying proportions.
Interestingly enough, these global trends remain the same irre-
spective of the trace duration. For instance, the Asian and S. Amer-
ican packet-level traces are of short duration (order of hours) while
the N. American trace is of the order of several days. Most impor-
tantly, the global trends are the same for the European network for
which we relied strictly upon the endpoint approach, without using
any operational traces. This implies that even in the absence of op-
erational network traces, valuable information regarding endpoints’
behavior can be effectively gleaned from the web.
9The use of the URL is explained in the next subsection on Trafﬁc
Locality.
4.2 Trafﬁc Locality
Next, we explore where do clients fetch the content from, i.e.,
how local or global are clients’ access patterns? Such patterns
might not necessarily reﬂect clients’ interests at the social or cul-
tural levels. For example, a client might access highly ‘global’ con-
tent, generated at another continent, by fetching it from a nearby
Content Distribution Network’s replica. Likewise, clients can get
engaged in a strictly ‘local’ debate at a forum hosted at the other
part of the world. Still, we argue that the results we present below
are necessarily affected by clients’ interests at social and cultural
planes as well.
We proceed as follows. First, from the mechanism mentioned in
Subsection 4.1.1 we obtain a pair of in-, out-network IP addresses
for each ﬂow. Note that for the case where we only have the URL,
we obtain its corresponding IP address via DNS lookup. Next, we
obtain the AS-level distance between the two IP addresses by ana-
lyzing the BGP Routing Tables as obtained from Routeviews [16]
using the method described in [40]. Finally, we resolve the coun-
try code for a given destination AS by using the relevant Internet
Routing Registries database (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC and LACNIC).
Figure 6 shows the results. The above plots in the ﬁgure show
AS-level distance among sources and destinations; the plots below
show the country code distribution for a given AS destination. As
an example, for the S. American trace, the AS-level ﬁgure shows
that the majority of the destinations are 2 AS-level hops away from
the sources. The corresponding ﬁgure below indicates that desti-
nations two AS hops away from sources reside in Brazil (around
30%), in US (around 30%), and in Europe (about 20%), etc.
The most interesting insights from Figure 6 are as follows. First,
results for China show very high locality: not only are the majority
of destinations in China as well, but majority of communication
beyond country borders still stays in Asia. Surprisingly (or not),
similar behavior holds for US, where the vast majority of content
is fetched from within US. Quite opposite behavior holds for S.
American and European endpoints. In addition to the local access
patterns, they show strong global behavior as well: S. America’s
clients fetch a lot of content from US and Europe; while European
clients fetch a lot from US, and much less from Asia.
5. DISCUSSION
How accurate is the information on the web? The ﬁrst ques-
tion we discuss here is how trustworthy is the information on the
web? To get a sense for this, we performed small scale experi-
ments.
In particular, we checked links posted on forums; also,
we did a port-scan against randomly chosen servers from various
server lists available on the web. We found that the information is
highly accurate. The vast majority of links posted on forums were
active, pointing to the ‘right’ content. Likewise, the ports that were
found active on the servers that we checked fully correlate with the
information available on the web.
How up-to-date is the information on the web? This is related
to the following two questions: (i) How quickly can we detect new
or updated information about endpoints? (ii) How can we detect
if the information on a given site is outdated? For the ﬁrst issue,
we depend upon Google, which is capable of quickly detecting
new content on the web; the Google crawler determines how fre-
quently content changes on a page and schedules the frequency of
crawl to that page accordingly [7]. For detecting outdated infor-
mation, we can leverage the following information: First, many
websites provide information about the time the content was ‘last
updated’. Likewise, entries on Internet forums typically indicate
the date and time of access. In both cases, this information could
be used to ﬁlter-out outdated information, e.g., older than a given
date.

Figure 6: Trafﬁc locality
Dynamic IP addresses. The number of endpoints using dy-
namic IP addresses is not negligible in today’s Internet [45]. Be-
cause such IP addresses are used by multiple endpoints, different
clients’ activities can be projected on the same address. Note that
servers are typically not run over dynamic IP addresses and even if
they are, they have to use a dynamic DNS service to be mapped to
a DNS name. In this case, our endpoint classiﬁcation could be en-
hanced with information about dynamic IP addresses as obtained
from logs maintained at dynamic DNS registries. While our cur-
rent endpoint classiﬁcation approach is primarily dependent on in-
formation about servers hosted on static IP addresses, it can also
be used to accurately detect dynamic IPs. Indeed, if an IP address
shows highly active behavior and matches to an abnormally large
number of different applications, that could imply a dynamic IP
address.
Using other sources of information. Not all information about
the endpoints is directly available on the web. The most impor-
tant example is p2p ﬁle sharing or streaming. Indeed, the ‘entry
points’ to such systems are necessarily available on the web (e.g.,
torrentportal.com). Yet, the next stage in communication,
i.e., getting the appropriate peer IP address to download a ﬁle from,
is not necessarily available in the web. Still, this information is
publicly available. It could be collected in a straight-forward way
by crawling such systems (e.g., [31]).
Non-Latin keywords. While we currently rely on parsing Latin
language scripts to generate our keyword set, even this allows us to
develop interesting insights about the non-Latin language speaking
countries, as we have shown while analyzing a network trace from
Asia. In future, however, we plan to extend our methodology to-
wards parsing non-Latin language pages in order to develop a more
comprehensive keyword set.
6. RELATED WORK
Information available on the web has traditionally been crawled
and indexed by generic search engines such as Google [6], Yahoo
[18], Ask [2] and Microsoft Search [13]. However, recently
there has been a steady increase in ‘vertical search engines’ that
crawl and index only speciﬁc content such as Indeed [8], a job
search engine and Spock [15], a people search engine. To the
best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to propose using infor-
mation available on the web for understanding endpoints, i.e., IP
addresses. In this regards, our work can be considered as a ﬁrst but
important step towards developing a vertical search engine for end-
points. Indeed, one of our future research directions is to build such
a crawler to index IP address information from the web (instead of
overriding on generic search engines).
