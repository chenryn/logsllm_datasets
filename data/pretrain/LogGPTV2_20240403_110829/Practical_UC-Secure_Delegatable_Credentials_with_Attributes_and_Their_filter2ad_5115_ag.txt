### Practical Application of Delegatable Credentials with Attributes to a Membership Service for Permissioned Blockchain

In this section, we explore the practical application of delegatable credentials with attributes in the context of a membership service for a permissioned blockchain. We also present an implementation of this scheme, demonstrating its feasibility for real-world applications.

#### Introduction to Blockchain
Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger widely used for various types of transactions, including cryptocurrencies. It serves as the foundation for Bitcoin [32], which significantly popularized distributed cryptographic protocols. Bitcoin is an example of a permissionless blockchain, where anyone can submit transactions and participate in maintaining the ledger if they have sufficient computational power. However, for certain applications, especially in enterprise scenarios, only designated parties should be allowed to submit transactions or modify the blockchain state. This necessitates mechanisms for identity verification, transaction moderation, and auditability.

#### Permissioned Blockchains
Permissioned blockchains, also known as private blockchains, address these requirements by implementing a membership service. This service issues credentials to authorized members, enabling transaction signing, authentication, access control, credential revocation, and transaction auditing. However, full traceability of transactions can compromise privacy and security. Anonymous credentials offer a solution by allowing the implementation of a privacy-preserving membership service.

### 6.1 Privacy-Preserving Membership Service

A membership service using anonymous credentials operates as follows:

- **Setup**: The Certificate Authority (CA) generates a signing key pair and makes the public key available to blockchain participants.
- **Certificate Issuance**: A participant generates a secret key and requests a membership certificate. The CA issues an anonymous credential containing the participant's attributes. These attributes are used for attribute-based access control.
- **Signing Transactions**: When a member needs to sign a transaction, they generate a fresh, unlinkable presentation token that:
  1. Signs the transaction content.
  2. Proves possession of a valid membership credential issued by the CA.
  3. Discloses the required attributes for the transaction.
  4. Optionally, proves in zero-knowledge that the certificate has not been revoked and provides a ciphertext containing the credential identifier encrypted under the auditor’s public key, along with a ZK proof that the same identifier is in the membership certificate.

This approach preserves transaction privacy and unlinkability while enabling auditing and revocation. However, a single CA can become a bottleneck and a single point of failure, especially in large-scale deployments involving multiple organizations.

### 6.2 Hierarchical Membership Service from Delegatable Credentials with Attributes

To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical membership service using two-level Delegatable Anonymous Credentials (DACs):

- **Root CA**: Issues Level-1 credentials with suitable attributes to local CAs.
- **Local CAs**: Issue Level-2 credentials to blockchain members, certifying their attributes.
- **Blockchain Members**: Use Level-2 credentials to unlinkably sign transactions, selectively disclosing attributes. Signatures can be verified with the root CA’s public key without revealing information about the local CAs.

This distribution of issuance and identity management among different organizations enhances scalability and maintains privacy. The number of delegation levels can be increased to support more complex organizational structures.

#### Enhancing Trust in the Root CA by Distribution
To avoid a single point of trust and failure at the root CA, Level-1 credential issuance can be realized through multiparty computation. Using the Groth signature scheme [29], this can be efficiently implemented. Root credential issuance is less frequent and critical, so the efficiency loss due to distribution is minimal in real deployments.

### 6.3 Implementation and Performance Analysis

We have implemented a prototype of our delegatable credentials system in C, using the Apache Milagro Cryptographic Library (AMCL) with a 254-bit Barreto-Naehrig curve [2]. The prototype generates and verifies Level-2 attribute tokens, demonstrating the practicality of our construction. Table 2 shows performance measurements and estimated timings, indicating that our system is efficient and scalable. We plan to release our prototype as open-source software, currently available upon request.

### 7. Conclusion

Our practical delegatable credential system with attributes addresses the privacy and security needs of a public key infrastructure, particularly for a permissioned blockchain membership service. Future work includes extending the system to support additional functionalities such as key lifecycle management, revocation, and auditable tokens. These extensions will require modifications to our ideal functionality ℱdac.
