43 For the purposes of this document, the expression “cybersecurity supply chain risk assessment” should be considered equivalent to “supply 
chain risk assessment” in an effort to harmonize terminology.  
44 A supplier may also refer to a source, as defined in the Strengthening and Enhancing Cyber-capabilities by Utilizing Risk Exposure 
Technology Act (SECURE) Technology of 2018.

4.1.2. Description 
Describe the purpose and scope of the C-SCRA template, and reference the enterprise 
commitment to C-SCRM and mandate to perform C-SCRAs as an extension of that commitment. 
Outline the template’s relationship to enterprise risk management principles, frameworks, and 
practices. This may include providing an overview of the enterprise’s C-SCRA processes, 
standard operating procedures, and/or criticality designations that govern the usage of this 
template. 
Reinforce the business case for executing C-SCRA by highlighting the benefits of reducing 
expected loss from adverse supply chain cybersecurity events, as well as the C-SCRM PMO’s 
role in efficiently executing these assessments at scale.  
Provide an overview of the enterprise’s boundaries, systems, and services within the scope of the 
C-SCRAs. 
List the contact information and other resources that readers may access in order to further 
engage with the C-SCRA process. 
Sample Text 
This C-SCRA is intended to fairly and consistently evaluate risks posed to the [enterprise] via 
third parties that hold the potential for harm or compromise as a result of cybersecurity risks. 
Cybersecurity risk in the supply chain include exposures, threats, and vulnerabilities associated 
with the products and services traversing the supply chain, as well as the exposures, threats, and 
vulnerabilities to the supply chain and its suppliers.  
The C-SCRA template provides tactical guidelines for the C-SCRM PMO to review 
cybersecurity risk in the supply chain and ensure that C-SCRAs are appropriately, efficiently, 
and effectively carried out in line with enterprise mandates. 
Requestors seeking to introduce third-party products, services, or suppliers into enterprise 
boundaries should familiarize themselves with the following template. This will ensure that 
requestors can provide the requisite information to the C-SCRM PMO to ensure timely execution 
of C-SCRAs and are otherwise aligned with adherence to the steps of the C-SCRA. 
The C-SCRA process contains five primary steps, as outlined in the below template:45 
1. Information Gathering and Scoping Analysis 
2. Threat Analysis 
3. Vulnerability Analysis 
4. Impact Analysis 
5. Risk Response Analysis  
45 See Appendix D’s “Assess” section for the methodological principles and guidance that underpin these steps.

To learn more about the C-SCRA process and/or submit an assessment request to the C-SCRM 
PMO, please go to [enterprise’s intranet page] or contact [C-SCRM PMO email]. 
4.1.3. Information Gathering and Scoping Analysis 
Define the purpose and objectives for the requested C-SCRA, and outline the key information 
required to appropriately define the system, operations, supporting architecture, and 
boundaries. Provide key questions to requestors to facilitate the collection and analysis of this 
information. The C-SCRM PMO will then use this information as a baseline for subsequent 
analyses and data requests.
