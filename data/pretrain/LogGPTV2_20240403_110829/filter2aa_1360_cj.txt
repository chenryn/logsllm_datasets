### Importance of Reverse Video Searching

There are numerous reasons why reverse video searching should be a part of your everyday research. The following methods will help you get started with the most popular video websites. These techniques can be replicated as you discover new services of interest.

#### Thumbnail URL and Full-Size Image

The thumbnail URL is particularly relevant to this topic. The URL provided in the API response points to a medium-sized image used at the beginning of each Vimeo video. To obtain a full-size image, simply remove the "_295x166.jpg" from the end of the URL. For example:
```
https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/513053154.jpg
```

### Applications of Reverse Video Searching

1. **School Resource Officers and Personnel:**
   - School resource officers and personnel are frequently notified about inappropriate video material being posted online. Identifying these videos, which may include fights, malicious plans, and bullying, can help manage the situation. Additionally, identifying multiple copies on other websites can provide a better understanding of the extent of the issue.

2. **Global Security Divisions:**
   - Global security divisions monitoring threats from protest groups often encounter related videos. Identifying multiple copies on various websites can reveal additional commentary, online discussions, and potential threats not seen in the primary source video.

3. **Human Trafficking Investigators:**
   - Human trafficking investigators can use reverse video search to identify videos posted by escort providers, similar to the now-seized site Backpage. The presence of identical videos across different geographical areas can highlight the travel and intentions of pimps broadcasting such details.

### Internet Archive (archive.org)

This view quickly identifies the email address `PI:EMAIL` as the verified uploader of the video content. It also displays the exact date and time of upload and publication. In this example, notice that the author waited over an hour to publish the content. Since 2016, I have observed that the Internet Archive has become a popular place to store video, especially for international subjects who may be blocked from traditional American services like YouTube.

### TV News Archive (archive.org/details/tv)

At the time of writing, the TV News Archive, another part of archive.org, had collected 2,094,000 television news broadcast videos from 2009-2020. It also extracts closed captioning text from each video, providing a search option for this data. This allows you to search for any words verbally stated during these broadcasts to quickly locate videos of interest. A search for the term "Bazzell" resulted in 35 videos mentioning someone with my last name within the broadcast. Selecting any result will play the video and all text from the closed captioning. The menu on the left allows filtering by show title, station, date, language, and topic. I have found this resource valuable when vetting potential new hires for a company.

### Live Video Streams

If you are investigating any live event that is currently occurring, live streaming video sites can be a treasure trove of useful intelligence. These services allow a person to turn a cell phone camera into an immediate video streaming device capable of broadcasting to millions. The common setup involves downloading a host service's application to a smartphone, launching the application, and transmitting the video stream via cellular data or Wi-Fi. The host then broadcasts this live stream on their website for many simultaneous viewers to see, with an average delay time of five seconds.

### Real-World Application

During several large events, I have used live streams to capture the majority of my intelligence. In one investigation, I was assigned to monitor social networks during a large protest that had quickly become violent. While Twitter and Facebook occasionally offered interesting information, live streams provided immediate, vital details that significantly impacted the overall response of law enforcement, fire, and EMS. The live video streams helped me identify new trouble spots, victims of violence needing medical attention, and fires set by arsonists requiring an immediate response.

### Video Analysis Tools

If you have discovered a target video on a YouTube or Vimeo page and need to analyze individual frames, you can use tools like Anilyzer (anilyzer.com). Enter the video URL, select the appropriate provider, and click "Watch Video." You can then click through each still frame or modify the playback speed to fit your needs. I use this tool when I need a quick way to scrutinize a handful of frames, especially with surveillance videos.

### IntelTechniques Videos Tool

If you feel overwhelmed, navigate to the "Videos" page in your Tools download to access an all-in-one option. This should replicate and simplify the processes explained throughout this chapter. Figure 22.03 displays the current configuration.

### Domain Names

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Domain Names**

A specific web page may quickly become the focus of your investigation. Websites, also known as domains, are the main sites at specific addresses. For example, the website that hosts my blog, `www.inteltechniques.com/blog`, is on the domain `inteltechniques.com`. The "www" or anything after the ".com" is not part of the domain. These addresses should always be searched for additional information. If your target has a blog at a custom domain, such as `privacy-training.com`, the content of the site should be examined. However, digging deeper into the domain registration and associated connections can reveal even more information. Every time I encounter a domain involved in my investigation, I conduct full research on every aspect of the domain, including historical registration, visual depiction, and hidden content. I rely heavily on the automated tools presented at the end of the chapter to make the work easy.

Every website requires information about the registrant, administrative contact, and technical contact associated with the domain.
