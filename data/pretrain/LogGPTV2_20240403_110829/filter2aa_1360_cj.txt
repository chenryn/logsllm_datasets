There are limidess reasons why reverse video searching should be a part of your everyday research. The following 
methods will get you started with the most popular video websites. These techniques can be replicated as you 
find new sendees of interest.
The portion relevant to this topic is the thumbnail URL. Following that description is an exact address of the 
"medium" image used at the beginning of each Vimeo video. Removing the "_295xl66.jpg" from the end of the 
URL presents a full size option, such as the following.
• 
School resource officers and personnel are constantly notified of inappropriate video material being 
posted online. Identifying these videos, consisting of fights, malicious plans, and bullying, may be 
enough to take care of the situation. However, identifying the numerous copies on other websites will 
help understand the magnitude of the situation.
• 
Global security’ divisions monitoring threats from protest groups will likely encounter videos related to 
these activities. However, identifying the numerous copies on various websites will often disclose 
commentary’, online discussions, and additional threats not seen in the primary' source video.
• 
Human trafficking investigators can now reverse search videos posted to escort providers similar to the 
now seized site Backpage. The presence of identical videos posted to numerous geographical areas will 
highlight the travel and intentions of the pimps that are broadcasting the details.

This view quickly identifies the email address PI:EMAIL as the verified uploader of the video 
content. It also displays the exact date and time of upload and publication. In this example, notice that the author 
waited over an hour to publish the content. Since 2016,1 have seen the Internet Archive become a very popular 
place to store video, especially from international subjects that may be blocked from traditional American 
sendees such as YouTube.
The premise of this site is to permanently store open source movies, which can include commercial and amateur 
releases. The search option at the beginning of every page allows for a specific section of the site to be searched. 
Selecting "community' video" will provide the best results for amateur video. A large number of anti-government 
and anti-American videos are present and ready for immediate download. Unlike YouTube, this site does not 
make it easy to identify the user that uploaded the videos. Furthermore, it docs not link to other videos uploaded 
by the same user. To do this, you will need to look for some very specific text data. As an example, consider 
that Internet Archive user Enver_Awlaki is your target. His video profile is located at 
http://www.archive.org/details/Enver_Awlaki. One of his video pages is stored at the address of 
https://archive.org/details/Awlaki_to_americans.
Below the video frame in the center of the page are several options on the lower right. These allow you to specify 
video files with different file types. Below these options is a link titled "Show All". Clicking the link provides a 
view of the files associated with the video as seen in Figure 22.02. The eighth link on this list forwards to the 
metadata associated with the video. This data includes the tide, description, creator, email address used to upload, 
and the date of upload, as seen in the text below the example.

Others: Repeating this process for every video sharing website can get redundant quickly. Instead, consider the 
following. Practically every' online video possesses a still image that is displayed to represent the video before 
being played in search results. This image is likely a direct link that can be seen in the source code. Searching 
"jpg" and "png" may quickly identify the proper URL. Providing this image to various reverse image search 
websites will likely display additional copies of the target video within unknown websites.
We will use this static URL within our tools. Also note that this view identifies the exact date and time of upload. 
The video page view only identified the date as "1 Year Ago". A reverse image search of the thumbnail URL, 
using our video search tools in a moment, will produce additional websites which host the same (or similar) 
video.

with the following websites.
At the time of this writing, the TV News Archive, another part of archive.org, had collected 2,094,000 television 
news broadcast videos from 2009-2020. Furthermore, it extracts the closed captioning text from each video and 
provides a search option for this data. This allows you to search for any words verbally stated during these 
broadcasts in order to quickly locate videos of interest A search of the term "Bazzell" resulted in 35 videos that 
mentioned someone with my last name within the broadcast Selecting any result will play the video and all text 
from the closed captioning. The menu on the left wall allow filtering by show tide, station, date, language, and 
topic. 1 have found this resource valuable when vetting a potential new hire for a company.
If you have encountered a video service which is not mentioned here and are 
solution which does not require any software configuration, 1 have had success 
These will attempt to download or convert any embedded video content.
There are now several companies that provide this free service. The following are listed in my order of preference 
for investigative needs. Each site has a search option to enter the keywords that describe the live event you want 
to watch. You may also see Twitter links to these sendees while monitoring targets.
If you are investigating any live event that is currendy occurring, live streaming video sites can be a treasure of 
useful intelligence. These services offer the ability for a person to turn a cell phone camera into an immediate 
video streaming device capable of broadcasting to millions. The common set-up is for a user to download a host 
sendee's application to a smartphone. Launching the application will turn on the video camera of the phone and 
the video stream is transmitted to the host via the cellular data connection or Wi-Fi. The host then immediately 
broadcasts this live stream on their website for many simultaneous viewers to see. An average delay time of five 
seconds is common.
YouTube and other providers attempt to provide captioning subtides for as many videos as possible. This 
automated process transcribes any spoken dialogue within the audio of the video file and documents the words 
to text To see this text while watching a video, click on the closed captioning icon (cc) in die lower left area of 
the video box. When die icon changes to a red color, the subtides will display. These subtides are contained 
within a small text file associated with the video. It also includes timestamps that identify the frame in which 
each piece of text is spoken. YouTube does not provide a way to obtain this text file, but Downsub does. Copy 
an entire URL of any YouTube video with closed captioning. Paste this link into this website and execute the 
process. This will display download links for the captioning inside the video. Links for each language will 
download text files with an .srt file extension. These automated captions are not usually completely accurate. 
Slang and mumbled speech may not transcribe properly. Any time you collect and submit a YouTube video as 
part of a report, I recommend obtaining this caption file as well. Even tliough the actual text may not be accurate, 
it can help during official proceedings with identifying a specific portion of a video.

Consider the Video Stream Tool presented in Section One when you want to view and capture any live video 
streams. It provides the most robust and stable option, especially if you keep your tools updated with the 
automated scripts.
This is nothing more than a simple video search engine, but I find it valuable. In a recent case, I searched a very 
unique keyword on Google and found no results. Petey Vid found a video from an otherwise unknown video 
host (bitchute.com). This is now in the tools and checked often.
This is not a video utility, but 1 believe it fits best within this chapter as a media service. Listen Notes queries a 
keyword through millions of audio podcasts and presents any results. As an example, I conducted a search of 
the term "privacy" and received 10,000 matches of that word within the indexed podcasts. We can take this a 
step further with an email address search. I searched "PI:EMAIL" and received one result 
based on show notes of an old episode. As the number of podcasts continue to grow, and audio to text 
technology’ improves, this technique will become more useful in our investigations.
Real World Application: During several large events, I have used live streams to capture the majority of my 
intelligence. In one investigation, I was assigned the task of monitoring social networks during a large protest 
that had quickly become violent to both officers and civilians. While Twitter and Facebook occasionally offered 
interesting information, live streams provided immediate vital details that made a huge impact on the overall 
response of law enforcement, fire, and EMS. The live video streams helped me identify new trouble starting up, 
victims of violence that needed medical attention, and fires set by arsonists that required an immediate response.
If you have discovered a target video on a YouTube or Vimeo page, you may want to analyze individual frames 
without using the utilities presented within Chapters Four and Six. You can use Anilyzer (anilyzer.com) for this 
task. Enter the video URL; select the appropriate provider; and click "Watch Video", you can now click through 
each still frame or modify the playback speed to fit your needs. 1 use this tool when I need a quick way to 
scrutinize a handful of frames, especially with surveillance videos.
If you feel overwhelmed at this point, I understand. Navigate to the "Videos'* page in your Tools download to 
access an all-in-one option similar to the previous tools. This should replicate and simplify the processes that 
were explained throughout this chapter. I hope you find it helpful. Figure 22.03 displays the current 
configuration.

This service provides numerous online searches related to domain and IP address lookups. Their main page

Entering cnn.com here presents the following information.
/\ specific web page may quickly become the focus of your investigation. Websites, also known as domains, are 
the main sites at specific addresses. For example, the website that hosts my blog, www.inteltechniques.com/blog, 
is on die domain of inteltcchniques.com. The "www" or anything after the ".com" is not part of the domain. 
These addresses should always be searched for additional information. If your target has a blog at a custom 
domain, such as privacy-training.com, the content of the site should obviously be examined. However, digging 
deeper into the domain registration and associated connections can reveal even more information. Even’ time 1 
encounter a domain involved in my investigation, I conduct full research on ever}' aspect of the domain, 
including historical registration, visual depiction, and hidden content. I rely heavily on the automated tools 
presented at the end of the chapter to make the work easy.
