change substantially (the difference is below 20%). Volume
can change dramatically over time, such as PA AlienVault IPs
in the scan category which is 13 times larger than before. On
the other hand, a feed like PA Blocklist Bots is now over 90%
smaller.
Intersection and Exclusive Contribution. Despite the vol-
ume differences, the intersection statistics between feeds are
largely the same across two years, with feeds in scan and
brute-force having high pairwise intersections and feeds in
other categories being mostly unique. Certain speciﬁc pair-
wise relations also did not change. For example, Badips SSH
still shared over 90% of data in Dangerrulez Brute back in
2016, and Paid IP Reputation in malware was still the only
feed that has a non-trivial intersection with multiple small
feeds. Again, most data was exclusive to each feed two years
ago: Across all six categories more than 90% of the indicators
are not shared between feeds.
Latency. The latency relationship between feeds was also
similar: timely feeds today were also timely two years ago,
and the same with tardy feeds.
Accuracy. Feeds have more unroutable IPs now than before
as shown in Table 4: In 2016, 22 of the 43 IP feeds had at
least 1 unroutable IP; four feeds had unroutable rates over
1%. When checking the intersection with popular CDNs, the
feeds that contain IPs in CDN ranges two years ago are also
the ones that have these IPs today.
Shared indicators 2016–2018. We compared the data we
collected from each feed in the two time periods, and found
that 30 out of 43 feeds in 2018 intersect with their data from
two years ago, and 9 feeds have an intersection rate over 10%.
Three feeds in malware category, namely Feodo IP Blacklist,
PA Abuse.ch Ransomware and Zeus IP Blacklist, have over
40% of their data shared with the past feed, meaning a large
percent of C&C indicators two years ago are still identiﬁed
by the feeds as threats today. Feeds in the botnet category,
however, are very distinct from the past, with all feeds having
no intersection with the past except Paid IP Reputation.
6 Absolute Latency
We deﬁned our latency metric in this paper as relative latency
between TI sources, since it is easy to compute and allows
consumers to compare feeds to each other on this aspect.
However, it is also critical to know about the absolute latency
distribution of indicators. Absolute latency represents how
fast a feed can actually report a threat, which directly decides
the effectiveness of the data when used in a pro-active way. As
we already discussed in Section 3.5, absolute latency is hard
to measure, as we do not have ground truth of the underlying
threat.
In Section 3.7, we used an Internet telescope as our approxi-
mation for ground truth to measure the coverage of scan feeds.
In Section 4.3, we used VirusTotal as an oracle to measure
the accuracy of ﬁle hash feeds. Although these sources are
not real ground truth and it is unclear how far away they are,
these large and well-managed sources can help us, to a certain
extent, proﬁle the performance of TI feeds. In this section,
we use these two sources again to approximate the absolute
latency of indicators in scan IP feeds and malicious ﬁle hash
feeds.
More speciﬁcally, we measure the latency of IPs in scan
feeds relative to the ﬁrst occurrence time of the same IP in the
scanners collected from the telescope. Considering the mas-
sive size of the telescope, it should presumably detect scanners
much sooner after the scanning event actually happened. We
measure latency of ﬁle hashes relative to the first_seen
timestamps queried from VirusTotal. The first_seen times-
(a) Latency distribution in scan feeds relative to the Internet telescope
(b) Latency distribution in ﬁle hash feeds relative to VirusTotal
Figure 5. Distribution of indicators’ latency in scan and ﬁle hash feeds. Note
that the scan feeds’ distribution are calculated in hour granularity while the
ﬁle hash feeds’ distribution are calculated in day granularity.
tamp represents the time when the corresponding ﬁle is ﬁrst
uploaded to VirusTotal. VirusTotal is a very popular service
and it is a convention for many security experts to upload new
malware samples to VirusTotal once they discovered them.
Therefore, this timestamp roughly entails when the security
community ﬁrst noticed the malicious ﬁle and can be a good
approximation for absolute latency.
Figure 5 show the latency distribution of each feed, using
the same plotting convention as in Section 3.5. Some feeds
are not shown in the ﬁgure as there are too little data points
in those feeds to reason about distribution.
! Finding: Comparing Figure 5a to Figure 2a, we can see
that the median latency of feeds are all larger. This is consis-
tent with our assumption that a large sensor tends to receive
indiscriminate scanners sooner. Scan feeds’ median lantecy
are one to three days relative to the Internet telescope, except
PA Analyst, whose median latency is almost nine days. The
order of median latency between feeds changed compared
with Figure 2a, but since the original relative median latencies
among scan feeds are very close, the new order here is more
likely to be statistics variances. Also, note that although the
PA AlienVault IPs seems much slower than it is in Figure 2a,
its 75 percentile latency is still the second smallest one.
On the other hand, the latency distributions of hash feeds
vary more dramatically. PA Malware Indicators, PA Sandbox
and PA Twitter Emotet are almost as fast as VirusTotal: all
three feeds have 25 percentile and median latency equal to

PA OSINT and PA Analyst are comparatively much
slower, and PA OSINT even has a 75 percentile latency of
1680 days. This might be because of the heterogeneous nature
of malware feeds. The ﬁgure also shows that feed volumes do
not imply their latency, as PA Analyst and FB Malware are
much slower than the small hash feeds.
Figure 5 demonstrates that the Internet telescope and Virus-
Total are indeed good approximations for absolute latency
measurement, as most indicators in TI feeds are observed rel-
atively later. However, every scan feed has over 2% of its indi-
cators detected earlier than the telescope did. FB Aggregator1
and DShield IPs even have over 10% of their indicators ob-
served earlier. There is also a similar case in ﬁle hash feeds.
This aligns with our observation in Section 3.5 that small
feeds can still report a non-trivial amount of their data ﬁrst.
Another interesting observation is that both Facebook feeds,
FB Aggregator1 and FB Malware, have a large percent of
their data observed earlier than the telescope or VirusTotal.
This again suggests that Facebook (and its threat intelligence
partners) might face more targeted threats, so those threats
will be ﬁrst observed by Facebook.
7 Discussion
7.1 Metrics Usage
Threat intelligence has many different potential uses. For ex-
ample, analysts may consume threat data interactively during
manual incident investigations, or may use it to automate the
detection of suspicious activity and/or blacklisting. When not
itself determinative, such information may also be used to
enrich other data sources, informing investigations or aiding
in automatic algorithmic interventions. We have introduced a
set of basic threat intelligence metrics—volume, intersection,
unique contribution, latency, coverage and accuracy—that
can inform and quantify each of those uses. Depending on a
number of factors, such as the intended use case and the cost
of false positives and negatives, some of these metrics will
become more or less important when evaluating a TI source.
For example, a feed with poor accuracy but high coverage
might be ideal when an analyst is using a TI source interac-
