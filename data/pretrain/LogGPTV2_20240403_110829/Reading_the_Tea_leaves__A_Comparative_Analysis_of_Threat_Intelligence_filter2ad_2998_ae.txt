### Paid IP Reputation and Other Threat Intelligence Feeds

#### Overview
This section provides a detailed analysis of various threat intelligence (TI) feeds, including their reputation, scanning, and blocking capabilities. The following is a list of the TI feeds analyzed:

- **Paid IP Reputation**
- **PA Lab Scan**
- **PA Snort BlockList**
- **FB Aggregator1**
- **PA Analyst**
- **Botnet Feeds**
- **PA CI Army**
- **PA Botscout IPs**
- **PA VoIP Blacklist**
- **PA Compromised IPs**
- **PA Blocklist Bots**
- **PA Project Honeypot**
- **Brute-force Feeds**
  - **Badips SSH**
  - **Badips Badbots**
  - **PA Brute-Force**
  - **Badips Username**
  - **Haley SSH**
  - **FB Aggregator2**
  - **Nothink SSH**
  - **Dangerrulez Brute**
- **Malware Feeds**
  - **FB Malicious IPs**
  - **Feodo IP Blacklist**
  - **Malc0de IP Blacklist**
  - **PA Bambenek C2 IPs**
  - **PA SSL Malware IPs**
  - **PA Analyst**
  - **PA Abuse.ch**
  - **PA Mal-Traffic-Anal**
  - **Zeus IP Blacklist**
- **Exploit Feeds**
  - **Badips HTTP**
  - **Badips FTP**
  - **Badips DNS**
  - **Badips RFI**
- **Spam Feeds**
  - **Badips Spam**
  - **Badips Postfix**
  - **PA Botscout IPs**
  - **AlienVault IP Rep**

#### Volume Analysis
The volume of data in these feeds can vary significantly over time. For example, PA AlienVault IPs in the scan category has grown 13 times larger, while PA Blocklist Bots has shrunk by over 90%.

#### Intersection and Unique Contribution
Despite volume differences, the intersection statistics between feeds remain largely consistent across the years. Feeds in the scan and brute-force categories show high pairwise intersections, while other categories are mostly unique. Specific relationships, such as the high overlap between Badips SSH and Dangerrulez Brute, have remained stable. Most data is exclusive to each feed, with over 90% of indicators not shared between feeds.

#### Latency
The latency relationship between feeds has also remained consistent. Feeds that were timely in the past continue to be so, and the same applies to those with higher latency.

#### Accuracy
The number of unroutable IPs in the feeds has increased. In 2016, 22 out of 43 IP feeds had at least one unroutable IP, with four having rates over 1%. When intersecting with popular CDNs, the feeds containing IPs in CDN ranges two years ago still contain them today.

#### Shared Indicators (2016-2018)
Comparing data from 2016 and 2018, 30 out of 43 feeds in 2018 intersect with their 2016 data, with 9 feeds having an intersection rate over 10%. Three malware feeds (Feodo IP Blacklist, PA Abuse.ch Ransomware, and Zeus IP Blacklist) have over 40% of their data shared with the past, indicating that many C&C indicators from two years ago are still considered threats today. However, botnet feeds are very distinct, with only Paid IP Reputation showing any intersection with the past.

### Absolute Latency
We defined our latency metric as relative latency between TI sources for ease of computation and comparison. However, absolute latency, which measures how fast a feed can report a threat, is crucial for proactive use. Absolute latency is challenging to measure due to the lack of ground truth for underlying threats.

#### Measurement Methods
- **Scan Feeds**: We used an Internet telescope to approximate the first occurrence time of IPs.
- **File Hash Feeds**: We used VirusTotal's `first_seen` timestamps to measure the latency of file hashes.

#### Findings
- **Scan Feeds**: Median latencies are generally one to three days relative to the Internet telescope, except for PA Analyst, which has a median latency of almost nine days.
- **File Hash Fees**: PA Malware Indicators, PA Sandbox, and PA Twitter Emotet are almost as fast as VirusTotal, with zero median latency. PA OSINT and PA Analyst are much slower, with PA OSINT having a 75th percentile latency of 1680 days.

### Discussion
#### Metrics Usage
Threat intelligence serves various purposes, such as manual incident investigations, automated detection, and data enrichment. The metrics introduced—volume, intersection, unique contribution, latency, coverage, and accuracy—can inform and quantify these uses. Depending on the intended use case and the cost of false positives and negatives, some metrics may be more or less important.

For example, a feed with poor accuracy but high coverage might be ideal for interactive use by analysts, while a feed with high accuracy and low latency might be better for automated detection.
