User: I am a newbie to TensorFlow (and the whole deep learning as well). I have a machine with dual boot, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.
Under which OS should I install and run TensorFlow? Windows or Ubuntu?
Also, what is the recommended Python environment? Anaconda or native pip?
Assistant: I think it's easier for you to use Ubuntu if you have the possibility. Getting lapack and blas libraries from sources is easier in linux (you can get precompiled packages for windows though). I prefer native pip, but for windows and for starting Anaconda should be the choice.
