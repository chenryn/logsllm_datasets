User: I have page that allows user to select tasks which should be executed in selected order, one by one. So, it create group of tasks. User can create several of them. For each group I should make possible to look on tasks progress. 
I'm looked into several things like chain, chord, group but it seems very tricky for me, and I don't see any possibility to look on each task progress.
What's good solution for this kind of problem?
Assistant: I would use a model. The user selects the tasks and orders them, creating records in the table. A celery task runs and executes the tasks from the table in the specified order.
