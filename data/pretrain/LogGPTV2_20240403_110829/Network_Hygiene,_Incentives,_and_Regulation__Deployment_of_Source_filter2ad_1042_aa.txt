ABSTRACT
The Spoofer project has collected data on the deployment and char-
acteristics of IP source address validation on the Internet since 2005.
Data from the project comes from participants who install an active
probing client that runs in the background. The client automati-
cally runs tests both periodically and when it detects a new network
attachment point. We analyze the rich dataset of Spoofer tests in
multiple dimensions: across time, networks, autonomous systems,
countries, and by Internet protocol version. In our data for the year
ending August 2019, at least a quarter of tested ASes did not filter
packets with spoofed source addresses leaving their networks. We
show that routers performing Network Address Translation do
not always filter spoofed packets, as 6.4% of IPv4/24 tested in the
year ending August 2019 did not filter. Worse, at least two thirds
of tested ASes did not filter packets entering their networks with
source addresses claiming to be from within their network that
arrived from outside their network. We explore several approaches
to encouraging remediation and the challenges of evaluating their
impact. While we have been able to remediate 352 IPv4/24, we have
found an order of magnitude more IPv4/24 that remains unremedi-
ated, despite myriad remediation strategies, with 21% unremediated
for more than six months. Our analysis provides the most complete
and confident picture of the Internet’s susceptibility to date of this
long-standing vulnerability. Although there is no simple solution
to address the remaining long-tail of unremediated networks, we
conclude with a discussion of possible non-technical interventions,
and demonstrate how the platform can support evaluation of the
impact of such interventions over time.

1 INTRODUCTION
IP source address spoofing is the process of generating IP packets
with arbitrary source addresses, i.e., addresses other than those
assigned to a host based on its network interface attachment point.
Hosts can trivially generate spoofed-source IP packets. Malicious
actors exploit this spoofing ability to mount a wide variety of at-
tacks, e.g., volumetric denial-of-service [26] (DoS), resource exhaus-
tion [17], policy evasion [39], and cache poisoning [53] to name
just a few. In April 2019, IP addresses of large U.S. bank websites
were spoofed by an attacker that used them to perform suspicious
scanning [36] so that the addresses appeared on blacklists. This cre-
ative use of spoofing caused security products to block the bank’s
addresses, such that people using those security products, even
unknowingly, were unable to interact with their banks.
Highly distributed ownership of network infrastructure makes it
operationally difficult to block or trace back attacks using spoofed
addresses to their true source. Therefore, best common practice for
nearly 20 years has enjoined operators to verify the source addresses
of traffic leaving their networks. Commonly referred to as “Source
Address Validation” (SAV) or Best Current Practice (BCP) 38 [19],
this prophylactic only prevents a provider who deploys SAV from
originating spoofed-source traffic; it does not protect the provider
from receiving spoofed traffic or being the victim of an attack.
Unfortunately, continual incidences of spoofing demonstrates that
SAV is not ubiquitously deployed. Spoofing continues to serve as a
primary attack vector for large-scale DoS attacks [3, 27], and these
attacks continue to increase in prevalence [24] and intensity; in
2018 GitHub experienced attacks of 1.35Tbps [26].
In this work, we report on long-term efforts and results of the
Spoofer project. The Spoofer project is an effort to crowd-source
measurements of the ability to spoof from many points in the net-
work, and thus better understand the Internet’s susceptibility to
spoofed-source attacks. The data from the Spoofer project comes
from volunteers who run the Spoofer client, which sends and re-
ceives a variety of spoofed packets. On the basis of which packets
sent by the client are received by servers maintained by the Spoofer
project, and which packets sent by the servers are received by the
client, the system infers the granularity and types of any SAV on
paths involving the client.
The Spoofer project’s primary goal is to serve as an independent
auditor and long-term record of Internet-wide SAV deployment.
Toward this goal, we have continually improved the project by:
i) removing barriers and incentivizing spoof testing; ii) making
changes to the system to gather more tests from more locations;
iii) adding tests that deepen our understanding of SAV deployment;
and iv) attempting to incentivize SAV deployment. The data we
have amassed represents the most comprehensive picture of SAV
deployment on the Internet currently available. On the basis of this
data, we report on the following five contributions:
(1) Three years of longitudinal Spoofer measurements col-
lected by an automated client. In addition to reporting on pre-
viously uninvestigated aspects of SAV, e.g., IPv6 spoofing ability,
spoofing through Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, and
filtering inbound into a destination network, we perform a macro-
level analysis of the Internet’s resistance to spoofing along multiple
dimensions. Despite obtaining significantly more tests (both across
time and topology), we find that the prevalence of SAV filtering has
not measurably increased in the past decade. (§4)
(2) Quantitative assessment of the representativeness of
the data. Crowd-sourced measurements present inherent chal-
lenges to survey data because participants impart bias. While our
system design (§3) removes barriers to testing, and permits con-
tinual gathering of tests, we observe a decidedly non-uniform test
coverage across networks and geographic regions. We therefore
examine the extent to which the daemonized client successfully
gathers longitudinal data. We build a simple model to predict spoofa-
bility based on previously observed measurements, and use it as
a proxy for the quality of the data we have gathered. By showing
that our model yields accurate predictions, we gain confidence in
the degree to which our results have predictive power and reflect
the larger Internet. (§5)
(3) A comprehensive understanding of the relationship
between NAT as SAV, and the implications of an IPv6 Inter-
net without NAT. Challenging a commonly held assumption that
NATs prevent spoofing, we show that clients in 6.4% of IPv4 prefixes
tested in the year ending August 2019 were able to send packets
with spoofed source addresses from behind a NAT, and these pack-
ets were not filtered by their ISP. Not only do NATs not prevent
spoofing, but the deployment of IPv6 presents new opportunities
for attackers: many inexpensive, vulnerable IoT devices connected
without NATs, capable of spoofing addresses from a much larger
address space. We characterize SAV in both the context of NAT and
IPv6 to dispel misconceptions about their role in abuse. (§6)
(4) Analysis of concerted remediation efforts, including
publishing (“name-and-shame”) lists of providers with miss-
ing or misconfigured SAV. Between February 2016 and December
2018, we sent 1,877 private email notifications to networks that
failed the SAV test. Beginning April 2018, we sent geographically-
scoped public emails to regional network operator group mailing
lists. After we stopped sending private notifications, the rate of
remediation did not drop, leading us to believe that the private
notifications had no measurable impact on remediation. (§7)
(5) Discussion of practical steps to increase global SAV de-
ployment. Our work demonstrates the difficulty of incentivizing
providers to deploy SAV. However, we find several areas of “low
hanging fruit” that are incentive-compatible and would have sig-
nificant impact if adopted. Specifically, we show that operators can
protect their own networks by filtering spoofed packets claiming
to be from within their network when they arrive from outside of
their network, and we highlight the set of Autonomous Systems
(ASes) that are conducive to their provider’s use of filtering using
Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), with no collateral damage.
We include possible non-technical interventions, and demonstrate
how the platform can support evaluation of the impact of such
interventions over time. We argue that the only likely way to cover
this long-tail of remediation is for equipment manufacturers to
enable SAV by default. (§8)
2 RELATED WORK
On the prevalence of spoofed-source DoS attacks. In 2000 and
2001, spoofed-source attacks were prevalent enough for researchers
to propose methods to trace back the source of spoofed pack-
ets [47, 49]; none have seen deployment due to operational and
coordination costs. Recently, Jonker et al. analyzed data sets that
covered a two-year period (March 2015 to February 2017) to infer
20 million denial of service attacks targeting 2.2 million /24 IPv4
blocks, more than one-third of those estimated to be active on the
Internet [24]. A 2017 survey of 84 operators [30] confirmed the
lack of resources (both knowledge and time) required to accurately
maintain SAV filtering. The more fundamental issue is misaligned
incentives: namely, SAV benefits other people’s networks (and their
customers), not the network that has to deploy it (or its customers).
On promotion of SAV deployment. Many academic research
efforts have described techniques to promote deployment of SAV [15,
31, 32, 62]. In 2014, the Internet Society began to foster grassroots
community support to launch the global MANRS initiative – Mu-
tually Agreed Norms for Routing Security [22], which included a
public commitment to deploy source address validation, among
other routing security best practices. In §8 we show that, in our
data, their members are no more likely than the general population
to deploy SAV. In 2016, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and
Technology (NIST) provided a technical evaluation of the perfor-
mance impact of deploying various types of reverse path filtering
in commercial routers [38], and in 2018 provided deployment guid-
ance [50].
On crowd-sourced measurement of SAV deployment. In
2005, Beverly et al. developed a client-server technique to allow
users to test networks to which they are currently attached [5],
and operationalized a platform to track trends from February 2005
to April 2009 [6]. This system required a user to download and
execute the client software once per measurement, limiting cover-
age. In 2017, Lone et al. used five paid crowd-sourcing platforms
to collect SAV measurements over a six-week period [33]. They
paid platform fees of ≈ 2,000 Euros to have workers execute 1519
Spoofer measurements from 91 countries and 784 unique ASes, 342
of which the Spoofer project had not measured. They reported that
the observed spoofability in these measurements was similar to the
volunteer-based Spoofer system.
On inference of spoofing from other data sources. To over-
come the requirement for a vantage point in every network, over the
last few years researchers have investigated creative opportunistic
techniques to infer lack of SAV in other macroscopic Internet data
sets. In 2017, Lone et al. reported a technique to infer evidence of
spoofed traffic in massive traceroute archives, based on the knowl-
edge that an edge network should not appear to provide transit in
a traceroute path [34]. This method is also limited by what appears
in the traceroute archives, as well as by the inconsistent addressing
conventions used in traceroute implementations.
Also in 2017, Lichtblau et al. used a large Internet Exchange
Point (IXP) as a vantage point for inferring which networks had not
deployed SAV [30]. They compared source IP addresses of packets
an IXP member sent across the IXP fabric with the range of source
addresses expected based on routes observed using the Border Gate-
way Protocol (BGP). This approach faced challenges of accurately
inferring ranges of source addresses expected for a given AS, and
obtaining cooperation of the IXPs to access traffic data. The authors
did not use the data for remediation.
Effectiveness of remediation attempts. Several studies have
shown the difficulty in effecting remediation of vulnerabilities via
notification, even for vulnerabilities that pose risks to the notified
networks themselves, as opposed to the rest of the Internet. Stock
et al. found a marginal improvement in remediation rate due to no-
tification of 44,000 vulnerable web sites; a key obstacle was getting
the notification to the right person in the organization [52]. Li et al.
found a similarly daunting result, that the most effective approach
was to notify contacts registered in WHOIS [14] via a message with
detailed information about a vulnerability [28]. Such notifications
had a statistically significant impact on improving remediation (11%
more contacts remediated than in the control group), but only a
minority took any remediative action, often only partial, and repeat
notifications had no effect. Reporting vulnerabilities through Com-
puter Emergency Response Team (CERT) organizations appeared to
be of limited utility. Hastings et al. found even more disappointing
results in their study of the response to disclosure of an RSA private
