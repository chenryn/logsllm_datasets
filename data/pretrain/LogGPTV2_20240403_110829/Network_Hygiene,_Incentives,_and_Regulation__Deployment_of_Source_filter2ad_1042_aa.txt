## Abstract
The Spoofer project has been collecting data on the deployment and characteristics of IP source address validation (SAV) on the Internet since 2005. This data is gathered from participants who install an active probing client that runs in the background, conducting tests both periodically and when a new network attachment point is detected. We analyze this rich dataset across multiple dimensions, including time, networks, autonomous systems, countries, and Internet protocol versions.

Our analysis for the year ending August 2019 reveals that at least a quarter of tested ASes did not filter packets with spoofed source addresses leaving their networks. Additionally, 6.4% of IPv4/24 prefixes tested did not filter such packets, even when they passed through Network Address Translation (NAT) devices. More concerning, at least two-thirds of tested ASes did not filter packets entering their networks with source addresses claiming to be from within their network but arriving from outside.

We explore various approaches to encourage remediation and the challenges in evaluating their impact. Despite numerous remediation strategies, we have only been able to remediate 352 IPv4/24 prefixes, while an order of magnitude more remain unremediated, with 21% unremediated for over six months. Our analysis provides the most comprehensive and reliable picture of the Internet's susceptibility to this long-standing vulnerability. While there is no simple solution to address the remaining unremediated networks, we discuss possible non-technical interventions and demonstrate how the Spoofer platform can support the evaluation of such interventions over time.

## Introduction
IP source address spoofing involves generating IP packets with arbitrary source addresses, different from those assigned to a host based on its network interface attachment point. Malicious actors exploit this capability to launch various attacks, such as volumetric denial-of-service (DoS), resource exhaustion, policy evasion, and cache poisoning. For example, in April 2019, an attacker spoofed the IP addresses of large U.S. bank websites, causing security products to block these addresses and preventing users from accessing their banks.

Given the distributed nature of network infrastructure, it is operationally challenging to block or trace back attacks using spoofed addresses. Best common practice for nearly two decades has been for operators to verify the source addresses of traffic leaving their networks, commonly referred to as "Source Address Validation" (SAV) or Best Current Practice (BCP) 38. However, SAV does not protect providers from receiving spoofed traffic or being attacked.

Despite these best practices, spoofing continues to be a primary attack vector for large-scale DoS attacks. In 2018, GitHub experienced a 1.35 Tbps attack, highlighting the ongoing prevalence and intensity of such attacks.

In this work, we report on the long-term efforts and results of the Spoofer project, which aims to crowd-source measurements of the ability to spoof from various points in the network. The data comes from volunteers running the Spoofer client, which sends and receives spoofed packets. Based on the packets received by servers maintained by the Spoofer project, the system infers the granularity and types of SAV on paths involving the client.

The Spoofer project's primary goal is to serve as an independent auditor and long-term record of Internet-wide SAV deployment. We have continually improved the project by:
1. Removing barriers and incentivizing spoof testing.
2. Gathering more tests from more locations.
3. Adding tests to deepen our understanding of SAV deployment.
4. Attempting to incentivize SAV deployment.

Based on this data, we make the following contributions:
1. **Three years of longitudinal Spoofer measurements**: We report on previously uninvestigated aspects of SAV, such as IPv6 spoofing, spoofing through NAT devices, and filtering inbound into a destination network. Despite obtaining more tests, the prevalence of SAV filtering has not measurably increased in the past decade.
2. **Quantitative assessment of data representativeness**: We examine the extent to which the daemonized client successfully gathers longitudinal data and build a model to predict spoofability. This model helps us gain confidence in the predictive power and representativeness of our results.
3. **Comprehensive understanding of NAT and SAV**: We challenge the assumption that NATs prevent spoofing and show that 6.4% of IPv4 prefixes tested in the year ending August 2019 were able to send spoofed packets from behind a NAT. We also characterize SAV in the context of NAT and IPv6.
4. **Analysis of remediation efforts**: We sent private and public notifications to networks failing the SAV test. After stopping private notifications, the rate of remediation did not drop, suggesting that private notifications had no measurable impact.
5. **Discussion of practical steps to increase global SAV deployment**: We highlight areas of "low-hanging fruit" that are incentive-compatible and would have significant impact if adopted. We argue that equipment manufacturers should enable SAV by default.

## Related Work
### Prevalence of Spoofed-Source DoS Attacks
Spoofed-source attacks have been prevalent enough to prompt researchers to propose methods to trace back the source of spoofed packets, though none have seen widespread deployment due to operational and coordination costs. Recent studies, such as Jonker et al., have analyzed large datasets to infer the scale of DoS attacks. A 2017 survey confirmed the lack of resources and misaligned incentives in maintaining SAV filtering.

### Promotion of SAV Deployment
Academic research has described techniques to promote SAV deployment, and initiatives like MANRS have included public commitments to deploy SAV. However, our data shows that MANRS members are no more likely to deploy SAV than the general population. NIST has provided technical evaluations and deployment guidance for reverse path filtering.

### Crowd-Sourced Measurement of SAV Deployment
Beverly et al. developed a client-server technique for SAV testing, and Lone et al. used paid crowd-sourcing platforms to collect SAV measurements. These efforts have shown similar spoofability to volunteer-based systems.

### Inference of Spoofing from Other Data Sources
Researchers have explored creative techniques to infer lack of SAV from macroscopic Internet data sets. For example, Lone et al. used traceroute archives, and Lichtblau et al. used Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to infer SAV deployment. These methods face challenges in accuracy and cooperation.

### Effectiveness of Remediation Attempts
Studies have shown the difficulty in effecting remediation via notification. Stock et al. and Li et al. found marginal improvements in remediation rates, but only a minority took any remediative action. CERT organizations have also shown limited utility in reporting vulnerabilities.

By providing a comprehensive and confident picture of the Internet's susceptibility to IP spoofing, our work highlights the need for continued and innovative approaches to address this long-standing vulnerability.
