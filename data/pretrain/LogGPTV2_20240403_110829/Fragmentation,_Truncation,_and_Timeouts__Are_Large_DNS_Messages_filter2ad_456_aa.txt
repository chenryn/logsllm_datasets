## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental service on the Internet, mapping applications and services to hosts. DNS primarily uses UDP for transport, but large responses can fail to reach their destinations, leading to unreachability. This paper analyzes 164 billion query/response pairs from over 46,000 autonomous systems, collected over three months (July 2019 and 2020, and October 2020) at the authoritative servers of .nl, the country-code top-level domain of the Netherlands. Our findings indicate that fragmentation and related issues rarely occur at these authoritative servers. We also show that DNS's built-in defenses, such as truncation, EDNS0 buffer sizes, reduced responses, and TCP fallback, are effective in mitigating fragmentation. Finally, we measure the adoption of the DNS Flag Day 2020.

## 1 Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) [31] is a core Internet service, mapping hosts, services, and applications to IP addresses. Both UDP and TCP are supported as transport protocols [4, 31], with most queries using UDP [48, 54]. UDP offers faster response times, typically within one round-trip time (RTT), while TCP requires an additional RTT due to its session establishment handshake.

Small DNS responses fit into the 512-byte limit of DNS/UDP, but larger responses, such as those protected by DNSSEC [3, 4, 27], may exceed this limit. To address this, the Extension Mechanisms for DNS 0 (EDNS0) [7, 52] standard was introduced. EDNS0 allows a DNS client to advertise its UDP buffer size, enabling an EDNS0-compatible authoritative server to send UDP packets up to the client’s announced buffer size, up to 65,536 bytes.

If a DNS response exceeds the client’s advertised EDNS0 limit (or 512 bytes if EDNS0 is not used), the authoritative server truncates the response and sets the TC bit [32]. The client then resends the query over TCP [4, 10] (DNS/TCP) to handle the large message with multiple segments.

However, the EDNS0 buffer size is independent of the path MTU between the client and the authoritative server. The common MTU on the Internet is 1500 bytes [4], and EDNS0 buffer sizes often exceed this. If the packet size exceeds the path MTU, it may be discarded or fragmented [11, 39] at the IP layer.

IP fragmentation can lead to various issues, including blocked packets by firewalls [4, 5, 8], unreachability [51, 53], and security vulnerabilities [17, 50, 6]. Therefore, there is a consensus in the IP and DNS communities to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS [5, 12, 58].

In this paper, we analyze large DNS responses using data from the .nl zone, the country-code top-level domain of the Netherlands. Our datasets cover 3 months of data, including more than 164 billion queries/responses from over 3 million resolvers and 46,000 Autonomous Systems (ASes). We investigate response sizes, truncation, server-side fragmentation, and TCP fallback. Additionally, we characterize resolver’s EDNS0 buffer sizes and the adoption of the DNS Flag Day 2020.

## 2 Datasets
There are two main types of DNS server software: authoritative servers and recursive resolvers. Authoritative servers store local knowledge of a DNS zone, while recursive resolvers resolve domain names by querying authoritative servers on behalf of users. We analyze DNS queries and responses to/from the authoritative servers of .nl.

We collect data from two of the three authoritative servers of .nl (NS1 and NS3). The .nl zone contains several million domain names, with the majority signed using DNSSEC [48]. The analyzed servers are run by different third-party DNS providers and are replicated using IP anycast [29, 37], allowing the same IP address to be announced from multiple global locations over both IPv4 and IPv6. In total, NS1 and NS3 are announced from 61 global sites. We use ENTRADA [47, 56], an open-source DNS analysis platform, to analyze the data.

Table 1 summarizes the datasets we analyze. We study more than 164 billion DNS queries and responses, including 157.77 billion over UDP and 6.25 billion over TCP, covering July 2019, July 2020, and October 2020 (the first month after the DNS 2020 Flag Day [58]).

| **Month** | **IPv6 Queries/Responses (B)** | **IPv4 Queries/Responses (B)** | **Total Queries/Responses (B)** | **Truncated Responses (%)** | **Resolvers (M)** | **ASes (k)** |
|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| July 2019 | 29.79 / 7.80 | 45.38 / 15.87 | 75.17 | 2.93% | 3.09 / 0.35 | 44.8 / 23.3 |
| July 2020 | 28.68 / 7.54 | 43.75 / 15.01 | 72.23 | 3.72% | 2.99 / 0.67 | 45.6 / 27.6 |
| Oct 2020  | 27.80 / 7.24 | 42.06 / 13.88 | 70.10 | 2.96% | 3.12 / 0.62 | 46.4 / 28.2 |

Our datasets cover over 3 million resolvers and 46,000 ASes, significantly larger than previous studies on DNS fragmentation [51, 53] and active measurement platforms like RIPE Atlas [45], which has approximately 11,000 vantage points and covers 8,670 /24 IPv4 network prefixes [44] (May 2020).

## 3 Dissecting Responses from a ccTLD

### 3.1 How Common Are Large Responses?
To understand the frequency of large DNS/UDP responses, we first analyze the response sizes in our datasets. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of response sizes (DNS payload only) per anycast server, transport protocol, and IP version for July 2019 and July 2020.

![Response Size CDF](fig1.png)

We observe that over 99.99% of responses are smaller than 1232 bytes for all combinations of servers, protocols, and IP versions. This is consistent with reports from Google Public DNS [16], which states that 99.7% of responses are smaller than 1232 bytes [28]. However, our data focuses on a single ccTLD, while Google Public DNS covers multiple TLDs and delegations.

For .nl, the exceptions were in 2019, where NS3-TCP over IPv4 had 78.6% and NS1-TCP over IPv6 had 94.9% of responses smaller than 1232 bytes. Overall, large responses account for 95 million queries out of more than 98 billion queries (Table 1).

#### What Queries Generate Large Responses?
Next, we determine which queries lead to large responses. DNSSEC is often blamed for causing large responses. At .nl, DNSSEC increases response size, but rarely beyond 1232 bytes. Resolvers set the DO flag in their queries to receive DNSSEC-related resource records (e.g., DS and RRSIG). Responses to these queries have a median size of 594 bytes, while non-DNSSEC responses have a median size of 153 bytes.

A and AAAA queries (for IPv4 and IPv6 records, respectively) for ns*.dns.nl, the authoritative servers of the .nl zone, account for 99% of all responses larger than 1232 bytes. Without DNSSEC records, these responses are 221 bytes long. We found that response sizes vary between authoritative services. For NS1, responses were 217 bytes (median), while NS3 responses were 1117 bytes. This difference is due to configuration differences: NS1 returns minimal responses [2, 24], excluding "extra" records, while NS3 does not, inflating response sizes.

### 3.2 How Often Does IP Fragmentation Occur for DNS/UDP?
IP fragmentation can occur at the authoritative servers (for both IPv4 and IPv6) and on routers along the way (only for IPv4 if the IP Don’t Fragment flag (DF) is not set). For IPv6, fragmentation occurs only on end hosts [9].

#### Server-Side Fragmentation
If a DNS/UDP response exceeds the authoritative server’s link MTU and the server is not limited by max-udp-size (in BIND9 [24]), the server may fragment the response. We cannot directly know the max-udp-size limits, but we can determine the largest DNS/UDP response sent without fragmentation, providing a lower bound for max-udp-size.

Table 2 shows the maximum DNS/UDP response sizes per authoritative server and IP version. NS3 sends larger responses than NS1 in 2020.

| **Server** | **Year** | **IPv4 (bytes)** | **IPv6 (bytes)** |
|------------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| NS1        | 2019     | 1451             | 1470             |
|            | 2020     | 1391             | 1391             |
| NS3        | 2019     | 1484             | 1494             |
|            | 2020     | 2866             | 2866             |

Table 3 shows ICMP error messages caused by large packets for NS3.

| **IP Version** | **ICMP Type 3, Code 4** | **ICMPv6 Type 2** |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| IPv4           | 73                      | -                  |
|                | 641                     | -                  |
| IPv6           | -                       | 16                 |

These results indicate that server-side fragmentation is rare, and DNS's built-in defenses effectively mitigate the issue.
