Abstract. The DNS provides one of the core services of the Internet,
mapping applications and services to hosts. DNS employs both UDP
and TCP as a transport protocol, and currently most DNS queries are
sent over UDP. The problem with UDP is that large responses run the
risk of not arriving at their destinations – which can ultimately lead
to unreachability. However, it remains unclear how much of a problem
these large DNS responses over UDP are in the wild. This is the focus on
this paper: we analyze 164 billion queries/response pairs from more than
46k autonomous systems, covering three months (July 2019 and 2020,
and Oct. 2020), collected at the authoritative servers of the .nl, the
country-code top-level domain of the Netherlands. We show that frag-
mentation, and the problems that can follow fragmentation, rarely occur
at such authoritative servers. Further, we demonstrate that DNS built-in
defenses – use of truncation, EDNS0 buﬀer sizes, reduced responses and
TCP fall back – are eﬀective to reduce fragmentation. Last, we measure
the uptake of the DNS ﬂag day in 2020.
1 Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) [31] provides one of the core Internet services,
by mapping hosts, services and applications to IP addresses. DNS speciﬁcations
states that both UDP and TCP should be supported [4,31] as transport pro-
tocols, and nowadays most queries are UDP [48,54]. Performance wise, UDP’s
main advantage is that it can deliver faster responses, within one round-trip
time (RTT), while TCP requires an additional RTT due to its session establish-
ment handshake.
Rather common, small DNS responses ﬁt into the 512-byte limit that the
original DNS over UDP (DNS/UDP hereafter) has, but larger responses – such
as the ones protected with DNSSEC [3,4,27] – may not ﬁt. To overcome this 512-
byte size limit, the Extension Mechanisms for DNS 0 (EDNS0) [7,52] standard
was proposed. EDNS0 allows a DNS client to advertise its UDP buﬀer size, and
an EDNS0-compatible authoritative server “may send UDP packets up to that
client’s announced buﬀer size without truncation” [52] – up to 65,536 bytes.

Fragmentation, Truncation, and Timeouts: Are Large DNS

If, however, a DNS response is larger than the client’s advertised EDNS0
limit (or 512 bytes in the absence of EDNS0), the authoritative server should
then truncate the response to a size that ﬁts within the limit and ﬂag with the
TC bit
[32]. Upon receiving a truncated response, the client should, in turn,
resend the query over TCP [4,10] (DNS/TCP hereafter), and leverage TCP’s
design to handle large messages with multiple segments.
However, the EDNS0 announced buﬀer size is agnostic to the path between
client and authoritative server’s maximum transmission unit (MTU), which is
the largest packet size that can be forwarded by all routers in the path. The
most common MTU on the core Internet is 1500 bytes [4], and EDNS0 buﬀer
sizes can easily exceed that – we show in Sect. 4 that 4096 bytes is the most
common value. If it does exceed the entire path MTU, then the packet will not
be able to be forwarded by the routers along the way, which will to packets being
either discarded or fragmented [11,39] at the IP layer.
IP fragmentation, in turn, comes with a series of problems [5] – fragmented
IP packets may be blocked by ﬁrewalls [4,5,8], leading to unreachability [51,53].
Moreover, IP fragmentation has been exploited in cache poisoning attacks on
DNS [17,50], and DNS cache poisoning can be further exploited to compromise
the trust in certiﬁcate authorities (CAs) [6]. As as result of these problems, there
is currently a consensus in the IP and DNS communities that IP fragmentation
should be avoided in DNS [5,12,58].
In this paper, we scrutinize the issue of large DNS responses using as vantage
point the .nl zone, the country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) of the Nether-
lands. Our datasets cover 3 months of data, from 2019 and 2020, with more
than 164 billion queries/responses pairs from more than 3 million resolvers from
more than 46,000 Autonomous Systems (ASes). We investigate responses sizes,
truncation, and server-side fragmentation in Sect. 3, as well as determining if
resolvers fall back to TCP. Then, in Sect. 4, we characterize resolver’s EDNS0
buﬀer sizes and the uptake of the DNS Flag day 2020.
2 Datasets
There are two main types of DNS server software: authoritative servers and
recursive resolvers. Authoritative servers “know the content of a DNS zone from
local knowledge” [19] (such as the Root DNS servers [46] for the Root zone [23]),
while DNS resolvers (such as the Quad{1,8,9} public resolver services [1,16,36,
40]), resolve domain names by querying authoritative servers on behalf of users.
We analyze DNS queries and responses to/from authoritative servers of .nl.
We collect data from two of the three authoritative server of .nl (NS1 and
NS3, the remaining authoritative services did not support traﬃc collection at
the time). The .nl zone has several million domain names in its zone, with the
majority of the domains being signed using DNSSEC [48].
The analyzed authoritative servers are run by diﬀerent third-party DNS
providers (one from Europe, the other from North America). Both services are
replicated using IP anycast [29,37] – which allows the same IP address to be
462
G. C. M. Moura et al.
announced using BGP [41] from multiple locations across the globe, over both
IPv4 and IPv6. In total, NS1 and NS3 are announced from 61 global locations
(sites). We employ ENTRADA [47,56], an open-source DNS analysis platform
to analyze this data.
Table 1 shows the datasets we analyze in this paper. In total, we study more
than 164 billion DNS queries and responses – 157.77 billion over UDP and 6.25
billion over TCP, covering two full months (July 2019 and 2020) and October
2020 (the ﬁrst month after the DNS 2020 ﬂag day [58]).

We see that a small fraction of all responses are truncated – 2.93% to 7.15% –
depending on the month/year and IP version. Our datasets cover more than 3
million resolvers (deﬁned by distinct IP addresses) from more than 46k ASes,
which is far larger than previous studies on DNS issues with fragmentation
[51,53] and from active measurements platforms such as Ripe Atlas [45],
which has ∼11k active vantage points and cover 8670 /24 IPv4 network pre-
ﬁxes [44] (May 2020).
3 Dissecting Responses from a ccTLD
3.1 How Common Are Large Responses?
Before addressing problems related to large DNS/UDP responses, we need ﬁrst
to understand how often do they really occur in the wild, from our datasets.
Fragmentation, Truncation, and Timeouts: Are Large DNS
463
Figure 1 shows the CDF of the response sizes (DNS payload only) per anycast
server, transport protocol, and IP version, for both July 2019 and July 2020. We
see that most responses are smaller than 1232 bytes (right vertical line) – more
than 99.99% for all responses, for both servers, protocols/IP version.
Fig. 1. Response size CDF for .nl: July 2019 and 2020
This value is similar to what is reported by Google Public DNS [16], a public
DNS resolver service, also reports that 99.7% of responses are smaller than 1232
bytes [28]. Diﬀerently from ours, they run a resolver service, that queries multiple
TLDs and their delegations, while ours covers only one ccTLD. Still, similar
ﬁgures holds for both vantage points.
The exception for .nl was in 2019, where NS3-TCP over IPv4 had 78.6%, and
NS1-TCP over IPv6 had 94.9% of the responses smaller than 1232 bytes. Alto-
gether, for July 2019 and 2020, these large responses account for 95M queries,
out of the more than 98B queries (Table 1).
What Queries Generate Large Responses? We then proceed to determine
what queries led to large responses. DNSSEC is often blamed for causing large
responses. At .nl, DNSSEC we see that DNSSEC increases response size, but
rarely beyond 1232 bytes.
Resolvers set the DO-ﬂag in their queries if they want to receive DNSSEC
related resource records for each signed response (e.g. DS and RRSIG).
Responses to these queries have a median response size of 594 bytes, whereas
464
G. C. M. Moura et al.
responses that do not contain DNSSEC records only have a median response
size of 153 bytes. Responses that stand out are A [32] and AAAA [49] queries
(asking for IPv4 and IPv6 records, respectively) for ns*.dns.nl – the author-
itative servers of the .nl zone, accounting for 99% of all responses larger than
1232 bytes. Without DNSSEC records, this response is merely 221 bytes long.
We further found that the responses sizes for these queries changed per
authoritative service. For NS1, the responses were 217 bytes long (median), but
responses from NS3 were 1117 bytes long.
This staggering diﬀerence is due to conﬁguration diﬀerences between the
servers. NS1 is conﬁgured to return minimal responses [2,24], and its responses
do not include two sections with “extra” records (authority and additional
records section [31]). The NS3 operator did not enable this feature, which inﬂates
response sizes. These results show that response sizes are not only determine by
the DNS query types (DNSSEC, A, AAAA), but also by whether authoritative
servers conﬁgured with minimal responses or not.
3.2 How Often Does IP Fragmentation Occur for DNS/UDP?
IP fragmentation can take place either at the authoritative servers (for both
IPv4 and IPv6) and on the routers along the way only for IPv4, but only if the
IP Don’t Fragment ﬂag (DF) in the IPv4 is not set. For IPv6, fragmentation
only occurs on the end hosts (Sect. 5 in [9]).
Server-Side Fragmentation: If a DNS/UDP response is larger than the
authoritative server’s link MTU (and the server is not limited from large
responses (max-udp-size in BIND9 [24]) the server may fragment it.
Given we do not run NS1 and NS3, we cannot know what is their
max-udp-size limits. What we can know, however,
is what is the largest
DNS/UDP response they have sent and that was not fragmented. This value
provides a lower bound for their max-udp-size of the authoritative servers.
Table 2 shows the results. We see that in NS3 send far larger responses than
NS1 in 20201.
