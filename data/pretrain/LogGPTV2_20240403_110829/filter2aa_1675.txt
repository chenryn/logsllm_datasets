#### Introduction
In this presentation, we will explore the potential dangers of insecure home automation systems in luxury hotels, using real-world examples and a detailed case study of the St. Regis Shenzhen Hotel.

#### Hollywood vs. Art House Movies
- **Hollywood Movies:**
  - Hackers often complete complex tasks in just a few sequences.
  - Example: *The Italian Job* – Seth Green controls public transit to allow mini-coopers to run free.
  - Example: *Jurassic Park* – Electric fences are disabled, allowing dinosaurs to escape, but a hacker teen later fixes it.
  - Example: *Hack Hard* – A hacker defeats terrorists by taking over control of every appliance in a Chinese luxury hotel.

- **Art House Movies:**
  - The hacking process is more detailed and realistic, often taking longer to unfold.

#### Case Study: The St. Regis Shenzhen Hotel

**Step 1: Reconnaissance**
- **Observation:**
  - The iPad uses the guest network.
- **Action:**
  - The hero intercepts communication between the iPad and the devices using advanced technology.

**Step 2: Reverse Engineering the Protocol**
- **Initial Findings:**
  - UDP packets are observed flying left and right.
  - Communication occurs on port 3671.
- **Advanced Techniques:**
  - Use machine learning to discover the communication protocol.
  - Identify the protocol as KNX, a standard for building automation.
  - Utilize a Wireshark plugin for KNX analysis.

**KNX Interlude**
- **Research:**
  - The hero reads up on KNX and its specifications.
  - KNX is described as "the world's only open standard for the control in both commercial and residential buildings."
  - The communication protocol used is KNX/IP, which operates over IP networks.

**KNX/IP Frame Structure**
- **Frame Breakdown:**
  - Ethernet Header
  - IP Header
  - KNXnet/IP Header
  - UDP Header
  - Length
  - Protocol Version
  - Service Type Identifier
  - Payload
  - Total Length
  - cEMI (Communication Extended Message Interface)

**Example cEMI Frame:**
```plaintext
06 10 04 20 00 15 04 49 00 00 11 00 bc e0 00 00 08 02 01 00 81
/* TUNNELLING_REQUEST */
/* Header (6 Bytes) */
treq[0] = 0x06; /* 06 - Header Length */
treq[1] = 0x10; /* 10 - KNXnet version (1.0) */
treq[2] = 0x04; /* 04 - hi-byte Service type descriptor (TUNNELLING_REQUEST) */
treq[3] = 0x20; /* 20 - lo-byte Service type descriptor (TUNNELLING_REQUEST) */
treq[4] = 0x00; /* 00 - hi-byte total length */
treq[5] = 0x15; /* 15 - lo-byte total length (21 bytes) */
/* Connection Header (4 Bytes) */
treq[6] = 0x04; /* 04 - Structure length */
treq[7] = iChannelID & 0xff; /* given channel id */
treq[8] = 0x00; /* sequence counter, zero if you send one tunnelling request only at this session, otherwise count ++ */
treq[9] = 0x00; /* 00 - Reserved */
/* cEMI-Frame (11 Bytes) */
treq[10] = 0x11; /* message code, 11: Data Service transmitting */
treq[11] = 0x00; /* add. info length (bytes) */
treq[12] = 0xbc; /* control byte */
treq[13] = 0xe0; /* DRL byte */
treq[14] = 0x00; /* hi-byte source individual address */
treq[15] = 0x00; /* lo-byte source (replace throw IP-Gateway) */
treq[16] = (destaddr >> 8) & 0xff; /* hi-byte destination address (20: group address) 4/0/0: (4*2048) + (0*256) + (0*1) = 8192 = 20 00 */
treq[17] = destaddr & 0xff; /* lo-Byte destination */
treq[18] = 0x01; /* 01 data byte following */
treq[19] = 0x00; /* tpdu */
treq[20] = 0x81; /* 81: switch on, 80: off */
```

**Step 3: Gathering Attack Ingredients**
- **Required Elements:**
  - A tool to send KNX/IP frames (e.g., eibd).
  - A library of IP addresses for each KNX/IP router and corresponding room number.
  - A library of KNX addresses for each room and device.
  - A library of actions and action payloads for each device.

**Step 4: Performing the Attack**
- **Execution:**
  - Switch on every TV in the hotel.
  - For each [KNX_room, IP]:
    - For each [KNX_item, TV_action, TV_payload]:
      - KNXtunnel KNX_room/KNX_item TV_action TV_payload IP

**Step 5: External Attack**
- **Requirements:**
  - The attacker must be on the hotel network (which is open).
  - Options include:
    - A repeater with a large antenna and a bridge.
    - An iPad trojan that periodically connects to the internet.

#### Mitigation and Solutions
- **Current Security:**
  - The iPad, network, and KNX do not provide any security alternatives.
- **Proposed Solution:**
  - Create a secure tunnel between the iPad and the router with mutual authentication.
  - KNX has released new specifications, but their closed nature makes it difficult to verify them.

#### Aftermath
- **Immediate Action:**
  - The hotel took the system offline.
- **Future Steps:**
  - Security researchers, leaders in the automation market, and members of the hotel industry need to collaborate to provide guests with reasonable protection standards while enjoying home automation.

#### Conclusion
- **Future Projects:**
  - *Hard Hack II* – Location hint: The director likes the Die Hard series.

This presentation aims to highlight the importance of securing home automation systems and the potential risks associated with their deployment in luxury hotels.
