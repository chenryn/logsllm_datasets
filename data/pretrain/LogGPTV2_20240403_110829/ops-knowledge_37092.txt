User: I generally use Python 2.7 but recently installed Python 3.5 using Miniconda on Mac OS X. Different libraries have been installed for these two versions of python. Now, the entering either of the keywords 'python' or 'python3' in terminal invokes python 3.5, and 'python2' returns '-bash: python2: command not found'. How can I now invoke them specifically using aliases 'python2' and 'python3' respectively?
I am currently using OS X El Capitan.
Assistant: I already had python3 installed(via miniconda3) and needed to install python2 alongside in that case brew install python won't install python2, so you would need
brew install python@2 .
Now alias python2 refers to python2.x from /usr/bin/python
and alias python3 refers to python3.x from /Users/ishandutta2007/miniconda3/bin/python
and alias python refers to python3 by default.
Now to use python as alias for python2, I added the following to .bashrc file 
alias python='/usr/bin/python'. 
To go back to python3 as default just remove this line when required.
