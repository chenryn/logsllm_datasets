User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Storing rarely used single-purpose passwords How do you handle the storage of passwords that, by nature of their usage, you can't expect administrators to memorize?  Such as:


Administrator/root password when everyone logs on using their own account with administrator rights
Service account passwords that are only set during configuration, e.g. SqlServerAgent, SharePointSearchService, etc.
Web registrations for an entire company, e.g. Google Webmaster Tools, GoDaddy/VeriSign, MSDN, etc.


I certainly don't want to re-use a single password for so many different areas.  Options we've considered:


Encrypted file on network share
Shared KeePass database
Password protected Wiki
Single base password with small modification for each area


This comes to mind as I try to install a password protected PFX file from home with the one-time use password stored in a notebook in my locked desk at work.

Assistant: I work at a show with several techs.  We use Keepass/Keepassx and the files are stored in a subversion repository, that is only accessible via SSH with key-based authentication.

Using the VCS allows us to keep a copy of the password vaults offline and up-to-date.  If you keep your password file on the server, what happens when that server fails, or if it stored on the internet, what happens when the internet fails.
