ABSTRACT
Free Basics is an initiative backed by Facebook to provide
users in developing countries free mobile Internet access to
selected services. Despite its wide-spread deployment and
its potential impact on bridging the digital divide, to date,
few studies have rigorously measured the quality of the free
Internet service offered by Free Basics. In this short paper,
we characterize the quality of the Free Basics service offered
in Pakistan and South Africa along three dimensions: (i) the
selection of accessible Web services, (ii) the functionality of
those services, and (iii) the network performance for those
services. While preliminary, our ﬁndings show that data-
driven studies are essential for having more informed public
debates on the pros and cons of the current design of the Free
Basics service.

Internet.org [1] is a consortium founded and led by Face-
book since 2013 with the goal of bringing affordable In-
ternet access to everyone in the world. Free Basics is the
ﬂagship initiative by Internet.org, offering free access to se-
lect Web services in partnership with mobile (cellular) ser-
vice providers in developing and under-developed countries
around the world. As of May 12th 2016, Free Basics has
been deployed in over 40 countries in Africa, Asia, and Cen-
tral and South America, with a total population of over 1.26
billion (22% of world’s population) [2].1 Compared to de-
veloped countries, these countries have low Internet pene-

eight countries, including Nigeria with 180 million people,

tration rates (on average less than 20.4% of their population
access the Internet) [3]. However, mobile phone usage rates
in these countries are very high (on average about 101.7%2
[4]), making mobile phone users a ripe target for expanding
Internet usage. Free Basics, if successfully deployed world-
wide, has the potential to bridge the digital divide [5].
Our study of Free Basics is motivated by the following
high-level question: Free Basics is free, but at what qual-
ity? Today, beyond the limited information provided by Free
Basics themselves, there is little measurement data on the
quality of Free Basics services or how the service quality is
affected by Free Basics’ design. As we show in this work,
gathering data on Free Basics is challenging as existing mea-
surement infrastructures that use the traditional Internet (e.g.,
PlanetLab [6] and Measurement-Lab [7]) cannot reach into
or be reached from the walled Internet of Free Basics ser-
vices and users. However, data-driven studies of Free Basics
are necessary to help inform the public debates about Free
Basics, which in early 2016, have led to Indian telecommu-
nication regulators blocking Free Basics to over a billion po-
tential users [8, 9].

How Free Basics works Before we outline the research ques-
tions motivating our study, it is useful to understand the ser-
vice architecture of Free Basics. As shown in Figure 1,
the Free Basics service comprises three independent service
providers: (i) network service provider: the cellular carri-
ers that agree to carry data for any Free Basics service at no
added to the list between May 1st and Aug 15th 2016.
2>100% because people can have multiple subscriptions
cost to the end user, (ii) Free Basics proxy service provider:
all Free Basics trafﬁc is routed via proxies that are currently
run by Facebook, and (iii) web service providers: to have
their services accessed by Free Basics users, web site oper-
ators are required to ﬁrst re-design their services following
a set of technical requirements [10] and next apply to have
their service approved by the proxy service provider [11].
The Free Basics platform is open to include any web service
that meets the stated technical requirements (e.g., absence
of JavaScript, high resolution images, videos or iFrames).3
Such restrictions are put in place to support the target popu-
lation of mobile users in developing regions, where mobile
devices may not have full Web browsers and must access the
Internet via WAP or similar technologies [12].
Any mobile subscriber of the participating network ser-
vice providers can access (free of charge) the list of approved
web services by going to freebasics.com using their
mobile browser or by installing the Free Basics mobile ap-
plication [13] (while connected to their cellular provider’s
network).
Our goal: Assess the QoS of Free Basics In this paper, our
focus is on understanding the impact of Free Basics architec-
ture on the Quality-of-Service (QoS) offered by Free Basics
in practice. Speciﬁcally, we assess the QoS offered by the
three service providers comprising Free Basics:
1. Proxy service: We characterize the selection of web
services accessible via proxy on Free Basics.
2. Web services: We compare the functionalities of web
services tailored for Free Basics to their unmodiﬁed
versions on the Internet.
3. Network service: We analyze the network performance
(measured as bandwidth, latency, and page download
times) for Free Basics trafﬁc compared to that for paid
trafﬁc to the same site on the same carrier.
We perform the above analyses using data from a prelim-
inary study of Free Basics deployments in two countries,
namely Pakistan and South Africa. The data for our study
was gathered between April and August 2016. At a high-
level, our measurements show that while several tens of web
services are accessible on Free Basics, their functionality is
somewhat restricted and the network performance for Free
Basics trafﬁc is poor (compared to paid network access).
We highlight opportunities for a more informed public de-
bate with our ﬁndings. However, we do not think that our
measurement results by themselves are sufﬁcient to make a
strong case for or against FreeBasics. We conclude the paper
by outlining our future plans for extending this work.
2. MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
To assess the QoS of the three service providers comprising
Free Basics, we need to gather data on (a) the set of Free
Basics web services, (b) the webpages of these services to

analyze the functionality they offer and the network perfor-
mance while downloading them, and (c) the webpages of
the same web services on the normal Internet, to compare
the QoS of a Free Basics service with the QoS of the normal
version (using paid access).4
To collect the above data, we need to access Free Basics
service providers. However, we found that access to Free
Basics (including its proxies and web services) is restricted
to mobile devices registered with a cellular service provider
(i.e., with a SIM) in a country where it is offered. These
restrictions make measuring Free Basics challenging as no
network measurements from a machine outside of a Free
Basics provider can reach a Free Basics proxy or the sites
it serves. To measure Free Basics, at a minimum we need
a physical mobile device connected to an appropriate Free
Basics network provider in the country where it is deployed.
Figure 3: Experimental setup
Experimental setup To measure Free Basics, we create ex-
perimental testbeds in the Lahore University of Management
Sciences in Pakistan and University of Cape Town in South
Africa. The authors from each of these two locations set up a
smartphone with the necessary SIM connection. This smart-
phone acts as a Wi-Fi hotspot with a desktop tethered to it.
We use a remote connection to the desktop to measure Free
Basics via crawler scripts (with browser user-agent spoofed
to an appropriate mobile web browser) and network moni-
toring tools. We show this as a diagram in Figure 3.
Data gathered Using our testbed, we gathered the follow-
ing data: (a) the list of all web services accessible via Free
Basics in both Pakistan and South Africa; (b) the home-
pages of all web services available in Pakistan and some
additional pages for a subset of services for network per-
formance analysis (described in more detail in Section 3.3),
and (c) the pages for the normal Internet versions of the
same services, over the same cellular provider but with paid
network connection (where downloads count against a data
plan unlike Free Basics content). We extracted the URLs for
downloading the normal Internet versions of the web ser-
vices from their corresponding Free Basics URLs in an au-
tomated way.5

3. ASSESSING QOS OF FREE BASICS
In this section, we characterize the selection of Free Basics
web services and compare the functionality and network ac-
cess quality of these web services to their normal Internet
counterparts (using paid access).
3.1 Selection of accessible web services
We explore the web services accessible via Free Basics de-
ployments in Pakistan and South Africa. As of May 2016,
there are 74 services in Pakistan and 101 in South Africa.
The service listing in each country comes with a brief de-
scription of what each service does. We use these descrip-
tions to manually categorize the services according to their
functionality, as shown in Figure 2(a). We see a signiﬁcant
fraction of services in the education, news, health, network-
ing, entertainment and jobs categories.
We further manually categorize services according to whether
they are relevant to a global audience, country-speciﬁc audi-
ence (local), or to an audience in a developing region (Ta-
ble 1). Figure 2(b) shows the proportion of services in each
relevance category. We also split the services based on whether
they are available in both countries, or only in one speciﬁc
country. The ﬁgure shows that a signiﬁcant fraction of glob-
ally relevant services are available in both countries, and that
Pakistan’s Free Basics menu has a higher proportion of lo-
cally relevant services compared to South Africa.

Figure 4(a) and (b) characterize the popularity of the Free
Basics services, based on the Alexa website rankings for
that country. Figure 4(c) characterizes the services based
on their global popularity. The ﬁgures show that very pop-
ular content globally (presumably the “basics” in Free Ba-
sics) is often included in Free Basics, including Facebook,
Wikipedia, Bing and BBC. However, these popular sites ac-
count for a small fraction (≈20%) of the available services,
while other services included in Free Basics fall below the
top 2000 globally popular services, or top 500 nationally
popular services, as ranked by Alexa. Another interesting
thing to see is how the service list grows over time. We de-
tail such future works in Section 4.
A key take-away is that many globally/nationally popular
services do not participate in Free Basics, but a wide variety
of sites across multiple categories do. An important question
is whether services with these characteristics (small number
of globally and nationally popular services) are considered
useful to Free Basics users. Answering this question re-
quires ﬁeld studies with Free Basics users, which is beyond
the scope of this work.
Interestingly, we ﬁnd about 5% of the combined services
in Pakistan and South Africa, to be somewhat dubious. These
are listed as “spam” in Figure 2(a)). Table 2 lists these web-
sites and the reason why we consider them dubious. Some of
these services are not available, returning an HTTP 404 er-
ror. Others generate ISP warnings that accessing the service
will incur data charges, even though they should be acces-
sible at no charge as part of Free Basics. Finally, there is
the case of an unremarkable individual’s personal Facebook
page,6 included as a Free Basics service.

meet the technical requirements. While additionally control-
ling content for quality may seem reasonable at face value,
and important concern is how to do so without the perception
(or realization) of censorship. We believe this to be an im-
portant issue needing careful attention as Free Basics grows.
3.2 Functionality of accessible web services
To understand the impact of Free Basics’ technical require-
ments for participation on service quality, we compare the
Free Basics versions of services with their normal Internet
counterparts. Speciﬁcally, we download the homepages of
all Free Basics services in Pakistan, for both the Free Basics
and the normal Internet version.
We test these sites using URLs that correspond to the same
content available both in the paid and the free versions of the
web services, thus enabling an apples-to-apples comparison.
The structure of these corresponding URLs is described in
Section 2. A concern is that the content for Free Basics and
paid versions of the site may differ due to caching at the Free
Basics proxy. We tested and found no evidence of caching;
rather, the main content was identical (except for changes
such as elimination of JavaScript).
Effect of technical speciﬁcations: Figure 5(a) shows a CDF
of the ratio of the sizes of these homepages, normal com-
pared to Free Basics. We observe that 80% of the services
have at least bigger sizes and potentially richer content for
the paid version, compared to the Free Basics version. E.g.
