I just had a look at the implementation of
AopUtils#getAllInterfacesForClassAsList.
I remember that I usually implemented similar methods using a Set. If multiple
classes in a hierarchy implement the same interfaces the resulting list would
yield duplicate entries.
Beside the cosmetic effect it could also affect performance when operations on
the returned interfaces will be performed multiple times.
Maybe it's not a too common case, but I see it from time to time. So I would
suggest to use a Set here.
