**Advisory: New Sandworm Malware - Cyclops Blink Replaces VPNFilter**

**Version 1.0**  
**Date: 23 February 2022**  
**© Crown Copyright 2022**

### Summary
The Sandworm threat actor, previously attributed to the Russian GRU by the UK and US, has replaced the exposed VPNFilter malware with a new, more advanced framework called Cyclops Blink.

### Background
The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have identified that the threat actor known as Sandworm or Voodoo Bear is using a new malware, referred to as Cyclops Blink. These agencies have previously linked the Sandworm actor to the Russian GRU’s Main Centre for Special Technologies (GTsST). Notable malicious cyber activities attributed to Sandworm include:

- The BlackEnergy disruption of Ukrainian electricity in 2015
- Industroyer in 2016
- NotPetya in 2017
- Attacks against the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 2018
- A series of disruptive attacks against Georgia in 2019

Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement for the VPNFilter malware, which was exposed in 2018 and targeted network devices, primarily small office/home office (SOHO) routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices.

### VPNFilter
**First Exposed in 2018**
A series of articles published by Cisco Talos in 2018 detailed the capabilities and deployment of VPNFilter. The malware was deployed in stages, with most functionality in the third-stage modules. These modules enabled traffic manipulation, destruction of the infected host device, and likely facilitated the exploitation of downstream devices. They also allowed monitoring of the Modbus SCADA protocol, a capability that aligns with Sandworm's previous attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) networks.

**Targeting and Exposure**
VPNFilter's targeting was widespread and largely indiscriminate, with some notable exceptions. For example, there was an increase in victims in Ukraine in May 2018, and Sandworm also deployed VPNFilter against targets in the Republic of Korea before the 2018 Winter Olympics. In May 2018, Cisco Talos published a blog exposing VPNFilter, and the US Department of Justice linked the activity to Sandworm and announced its disruption of the botnet.

**Post-Exposure Activity**
A TrendMicro blog in January 2021 provided details on residual VPNFilter infections, showing a reduction in requests to a known command-and-control (C2) domain. Since the disruption in May 2018, Sandworm has shown limited interest in existing VPNFilter footholds, instead opting to retool.

### Cyclops Blink
**Active Since 2019**
The NCSC, CISA, FBI, NSA, and industry partners have identified a large-scale, modular malware framework affecting network devices. This new malware, referred to as Cyclops Blink, has been deployed since at least June 2019, approximately 14 months after the disruption of VPNFilter. Like VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink's deployment appears to be indiscriminate and widespread.

**Malware Overview**
Cyclops Blink is sophisticated and modular, with core functionality to beacon device information back to a server and enable files to be downloaded and executed. It also includes the ability to add new modules while running, allowing Sandworm to implement additional capabilities as needed. The NCSC has published a detailed malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink.

**Post-Exploitation**
After exploitation, Cyclops Blink is typically deployed as part of a firmware "update," achieving persistence through reboots and making remediation more challenging. Victim devices are organized into clusters, and each deployment of Cyclops Blink uses a list of C2 IP addresses and ports. All known C2 IP addresses have been used by compromised WatchGuard firewall devices. Communications between Cyclops Blink clients and servers are protected under Transport Layer Security (TLS) using individually generated keys and certificates. Sandworm manages Cyclops Blink by connecting to the C2 layer through the Tor network.

### Mitigation
Cyclops Blink persists through reboots and legitimate firmware updates. Affected organizations should take steps to remove the malware. WatchGuard has worked closely with the FBI, CISA, and the NCSC to provide tooling and guidance for detecting and removing Cyclops Blink from WatchGuard devices. Device owners should follow these instructions to ensure that devices are patched to the latest version and any infection is removed.

**Additional Recommendations:**
- If your device is identified as infected with Cyclops Blink, assume that any passwords present on the device have been compromised and replace them.
- Ensure that the management interface of network devices is not exposed to the internet.

### MITRE ATT&CK® Framework
This advisory is compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

| Tactic | Technique | Procedure |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Initial Access | T1133: External Remote Services | The actors most likely deploy modified device firmware images by exploiting an externally available service. |
| Execution | T1059.004: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell | Cyclops Blink executes downloaded files using the Linux API. |
| Persistence | T1542.001: Pre-OS Boot: System Firmware | Cyclops Blink is deployed within a modified device firmware image. |
| Persistence | T1037.004: Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: RC Scripts | Cyclops Blink is executed on device startup, using a modified RC script. |
| Defense Evasion | T1562.004: Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall | Cyclops Blink modifies the Linux system firewall to enable C2 communication. |
| Defense Evasion | T1036.005: Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location | Cyclops Blink masquerades as a Linux kernel thread process. |
| Discovery | T1082: System Information Discovery | Cyclops Blink regularly queries device information. |
| Command and Control | T1090: Proxy | Cyclops Blink randomly selects a C2 server from contained lists of IPv4 addresses and port numbers. |
| Command and Control | T1132.002: Data Encoding: Non-Standard Encoding | Cyclops Blink command messages use a custom binary scheme to encode data. |
| Command and Control | T1008: Fallback Channels | Cyclops Blink randomly selects a C2 server from contained lists of IPv4 addresses and port numbers. |
| Command and Control | T1071.001: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols | Cyclops Blink can download files via HTTP or HTTPS. |
| Command and Control | T1573.002: Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography | Cyclops Blink C2 messages are individually encrypted using AES-256-CBC and sent underneath TLS. |
| Command and Control | T1571: Non-Standard Port | The list of port numbers used by Cyclops Blink includes non-standard ports not typically associated with HTTP or HTTPS traffic. |
| Exfiltration | T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel | Cyclops Blink can upload files to a C2 server. |

### Conclusion
A Cyclops Blink infection does not necessarily mean an organization is the primary target, but it could be selected for further attacks or used to conduct attacks. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory and to refer to indicators of compromise in the Cyclops Blink malware analysis report to detect possible activity on their networks. UK organizations affected by this activity should report any compromises to the NCSC via their website.

### Further Guidance
- Do not expose management interfaces of network devices to the internet.
- Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date.
- Use multi-factor authentication to reduce the impact of password compromises.
- Treat people as your first line of defense.
- Set up a security monitoring capability.
- Prevent and detect lateral movement in your organization’s networks.
