User: In python, is there any way to check the progress of another windows application. That is to say for example, downloading a file in chrome, or converting a file in handbrake, Is there any way to get the current status of these processes. Specifically I want my script to wait until another program finishes a conversion, then continue.
Assistant: I guess a work-around for this would be to check the process's memory usage with shell command.
If the specific process does not matter, I guess you could run a shell command and get the general system memory status. But this will only work for memory hungry processes.
