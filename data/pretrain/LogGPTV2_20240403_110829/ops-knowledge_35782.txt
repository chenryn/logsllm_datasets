"A": "Adversaries may use non-application layer protocols, which are less commonly monitored, to evade detection.",
"B": "Monitoring only application layer protocols is adequate since all C2 communications occur over HTTP and HTTPS.",
"C": "Non-application layer protocols like ICMP and UDP can be used by adversaries for C2 communications and are not typically scrutinized.",
"D": "Application layer protocols are the only protocols that need to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts, so others can be ignored."
