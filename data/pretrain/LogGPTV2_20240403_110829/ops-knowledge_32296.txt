User: Install and configure Nginx reverse proxy server for a server to achieve high-concurrency and low-latency web services.
Assistant: To install and configure Nginx reverse proxy server, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx You can use the following commands to install Nginx in Ubuntu system: ``` sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx ``` 2. Configure Nginx By default, Nginx configuration files are in the `/etc/nginx/` directory. The default configuration file can be opened with the following command: ``` sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default ``` Find the following line: ``` server { listen 80 default_server; listen [::]:80 default_server; . .. } ``` Replace this with the following: ``` upstream backend { server 127.0.0.1:8000; } server { listen 80 default_server; listen [::]:80 default_server; location / { proxy_pass http:// backend; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; } } ``` This configuration configures Nginx as a reverse proxy server and forwards traffic to port 8000 of the target service, And add some common proxy headers. Ports and other settings can be modified as desired. 3. Reload the Nginx configuration After completing the Nginx configuration, you need to reload the configuration for the changes to take effect. You can use the following command: ``` sudo service nginx reload ``` Now, the Nginx reverse proxy server has been configured and can forward traffic to the target service and implement high-concurrency, low-latency web services.
