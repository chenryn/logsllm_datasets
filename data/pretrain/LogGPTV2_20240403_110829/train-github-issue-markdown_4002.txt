When writing code in TypeScript, it is often necessary to use `this` frequently, which can make the code look cluttered. In many cases, the compiler should be able to infer the context, making the code cleaner and more readable.

**TypeScript Version:**
- 1.7.5
- 1.8.0-beta
- Nightly (1.9.0-dev.20160217)

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// A self-contained demonstration of the problem follows...
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The TypeScript compiler should automatically infer the context where `this` is used, reducing the need for explicit `this` references and improving code readability.

**Actual Behavior:**
The compiler requires explicit `this` references in many places, leading to more verbose and less readable code.
