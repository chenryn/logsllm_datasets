Assistant: This log chunk shows the system changing network settings, including the channel, DNS, and IP address. It also shows the kernel and other software components performing various tasks related to the network, such as Wake on Scan offload, Link Up, and setting the NAT64 ifstate. Finally, it shows the corecaptured component skipping certain files and streams.
