User: I recently converted a python program to an executable (.exe) but i still see an output window when i launched the executable. I don't want any output window because the program is a background process. I tried using .pyw extension before converting to an executable with no success...  I'm using pyinstaller to convert to executables.
Assistant: Oh nevermind, i already know how.
By using --noconsole when converting the .pyw
I think it works with .py extension too
Sorry for bad english..
