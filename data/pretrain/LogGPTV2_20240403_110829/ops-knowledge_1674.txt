I recently converted a Python program to an executable (.exe) using PyInstaller. However, when I launch the executable, an output window still appears. Since the program is intended to run as a background process, I would prefer not to have any visible output window.

Initially, I tried using the .pyw extension before converting to an executable, but it did not solve the issue.

However, I have since found a solution. By using the `--noconsole` option when converting the .py or .pyw file with PyInstaller, the output window no longer appears. This seems to work for both .py and .pyw files.

Apologies for any confusion, and thank you for your understanding.
