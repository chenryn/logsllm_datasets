## ðŸš€ Feature
`torch.mean` currently only accepts a single dimension. It should also accept
a tuple of dimensions like `torch.sum` does.
## Motivation
Makes code cleaner and more concise when taking the mean of some quantity
across multiple dimensions. An example of this is taking the mean of some
pixel-wise quantity over an image (which has two dimensions, and potentially a
color channel).
## Alternatives
Current workaround is chaining `.mean`s repeatedly, as in
`array.mean(0).mean(0).mean(0)` to take the mean over the first three
dimensions of an array.
