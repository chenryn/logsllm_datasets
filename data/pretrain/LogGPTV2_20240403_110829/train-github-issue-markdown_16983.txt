### Apache Airflow Version
2.1.0

### Environment
- **Cloud Provider or Hardware Configuration:**
  - AWS ECS (EC2 mode)
  - RDS PostgreSQL for the database
- **Operating System:**
  - RedHat
- **Other:**
  - LDAP authentication enabled

### Issue Description
After upgrading from version 2.0.1 to 2.1.0, I encountered an issue where, as an admin, I can no longer see the delete, edit, and add buttons in the Users view. Attempting to navigate directly to the edit page by changing the URL (e.g., from `Users/list` to `Users/edit/1`) results in an "Access Denied" message from Flask-AppBuilder (FAB).

Upon inspecting the underlying permission tables, it appears that the Admin role no longer has the necessary permissions for these actions. I attempted to resolve this by deleting all permissions with the following SQL commands:

```sql
DELETE FROM dbo.ab_permission_view_role;
DELETE FROM "dbo"."ab_permission_view";
```

I then re-ran the `airflow sync-perms` command, but the issue persists. It seems that the default permission settings now default to read-only, even for admins on the Users tab.

The following query:

```sql
SELECT abv.permission_id, abv.view_menu_id, avm.name AS view_name, ap.name AS permission_name
FROM "dbo"."ab_permission_view" abv
INNER JOIN dbo.ab_view_menu avm ON abv.view_menu_id = avm.id
INNER JOIN dbo.ab_permission ap ON abv.permission_id = ap.id
WHERE avm.name = 'Users';
```

returns only one row with `can_read` as the permission name.

It is unclear if this is related, but I noticed a change in the 2.1.0 release: [Apache Airflow Pull Request #13856](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/13856/commits).

### Expected Behavior
Admins should be able to fully edit the Users view, including the ability to delete, edit, and add users.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Upgrade from Apache Airflow version 2.0.1 to 2.1.0.
2. Log in as an admin.
3. Navigate to the Users view.
4. Observe that the delete, edit, and add buttons are missing.
5. Attempt to navigate directly to the edit page by changing the URL.
6. Receive an "Access Denied" message.
