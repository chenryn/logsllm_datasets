**Apache Airflow version** :  
2.1.0
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** :
  * AWS ECS EC2 mode. RDS PostgreSQL for DB.
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release):
  * RedHat
  *     * **Other**
  * LDAP authentication enabled
**What happened** :  
We upgraded from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0 and now when i go to Users view (as admin). I
cannot see delete/edit/add buttons - if i try to simply navigate by chaniging
url from Users/list to Users/edit/1 for example I get Access Denied as per
FAB.  
I checked underlying permission tables and from what i can see Admin Role does
not have those permissions anymore there.
I tried deleting all permissions and with :
    delete from dbo.ab_permission_view_role
    delete from "dbo"."ab_permission_view" 
and then re-run airflow sync-perms  
this did not help.
loks like the default permissions settings are now defaulting to read-only
even for admin on users tab.
the following query:
    select abv.permission_id, abv.view_menu_id, avm.name as view_name, ap.name as permission_name
    from "dbo"."ab_permission_view"  abv
    inner join dbo.ab_view_menu avm
    on abv.view_menu_id = avm.id
    inner join dbo.ab_permission ap
    on abv.permission_id = ap.id
    WHERE
        avm.name = 'Users'
returns only one row with can_read under permission_name
not sure if this is related, but i can see this change in 2.1.0

**What you expected to happen** :  
Users with Admin role can still fully edit Users view.
**How to reproduce it** :  
Best i can say: just upgrade from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0
