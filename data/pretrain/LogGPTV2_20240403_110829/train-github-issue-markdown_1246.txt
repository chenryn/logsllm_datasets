Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

```julia
julia> begin
           module A
               1
           end
       end
ERROR: syntax: module expression not at top level

Theoretically, this code should work because the `module A` is defined within the global scope. However, it results in a syntax error, indicating that module expressions must be at the top level.

It would be beneficial to support such constructs, especially for macros that operate on large blocks of global code.

This version maintains the original meaning while improving readability and clarity.
