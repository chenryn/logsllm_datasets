**Current behavior**  
I have a component that may create inside it several other components that may
have Radio Button Groups inside them. I want the nested components to not have
to receive any reference of their index in the array since they may be used in
other situations. The problem is that each group seems to need an unique
'name'. By having several groups generated with the same name, the view only
shows the selected circles for one (although the value bindings work well)
**Expected behavior**  
I would like to be able to generate a unique random name for each radio button
group inputs or some other thing that would allow each button group to be
isolated from the other
**Reproduction of the problem**  
Here's a plunker in which it doesn't seem possible to have unique names for
each groups (without sending inside the reference of the array index which I
wanted to avoid, since the radioButton component is used in another part of
the app that doesn't really need any index. Apart from that reason I wanted to
pass in only the relevant data to that component. The real case is a little
bit more complex.
