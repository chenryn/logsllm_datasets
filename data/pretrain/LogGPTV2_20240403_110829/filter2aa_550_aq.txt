the first victims could be the Internet itself. The reason is that classified cyber at-
tack tools and techniques available to military and intelligence agencies are likely 
far more powerful than those available to the general public.405 However, as with 
chemical weapons (CW) and even with nuclear weapons, it is possible that non-state

actors, including terrorists, will acquire strategically significant cyber attack tools 
and techniques in the future.406
What is to be done? Severing one’s connection to cyberspace is not an attractive op-
tion. The benefits of connecting to the Internet usually outweigh the drawbacks; this 
quickly undermines a fortress mentality. And even theoretically “closed” networks 
– those with no direct connection to the Internet – are still subject to a wide range 
of computer network attacks (CNA).407
In light of our dependence on such vulnerable technology, and due to the fact that 
CNA is difficult to stop, world leaders may try to negotiate international agreements 
designed to contain conflict on the Internet.408 Cyber arms control is one possible 
strategy, and the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) may provide a strong 
candidate model.409
The Chemical Weapons Convention
Chemical weapons (CW) are almost as old as warfare itself. Archeologists have found 
poison-covered arrowheads dating to 10,000 BC.410 In the First World War, CW may 
have caused one-third of the estimated 5 million casualties. Today, terrorists are at-
tracted to CW not only for its killing power, but also due to its ease of acquisition.411
As a weapon, CW employs the toxic properties of certain chemicals in a way that 
can kill, injure or incapacitate humans and animals. Throughout history, each new 
generation of CW has been more dangerous than its predecessor.412
In 1997, 95 nations signed CWC, an international arms control agreement that has 
been a success by almost any measure. The treaty’s purpose is reflected in its full 
name: Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling 
406 Lewis, 2010: James Lewis of CSIS recently stated: “It remains intriguing and suggestive that [ter-
rorists] have not launched a cyber attack. This may reflect a lack of capability, a decision that cyber 
weapons do not produce the violent results terrorists crave, or a preoccupation with other activities. 
Eventually terrorists will use cyber attacks, as they become easier to launch...”.
407 Military and intelligence agencies are capable of supply chain attacks, insider exploitation, the stand-
off kinetic destruction of computer hardware, and the use of electromagnetic radiation to destroy 
unshielded electronics via current or voltage surges.
408 Markoff & Kramer, 2009a: According to The New York Times, Russian negotiators have long argued 
that an international treaty, similar to those that have been signed for WMD, could help to mitigate 
the threat posed by military activities to civilian networks, and that in 2009 the U.S. appeared more 
willing to discuss this strategy.
409 Others could be the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or the Biological Weapons Convention.

and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction. Its goal is to eliminate the 
entire category of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) that is associated with toxic 
chemicals and their precursors. The CWC Preamble declares that achievements in 
chemistry should be used exclusively for beneficial purposes, and that the prohibi-
tion on CW is intended “for the sake of all mankind.”
Each signatory is responsible for enforcing CWC within its legal jurisdiction. This 
includes overseeing the destruction of existing CW and the destruction of all CW 
production facilities. Under the convention, all toxic chemicals are considered weap-
ons unless they are used for purposes that are specifically authorized under CWC. 
Further, members are prohibited from transferring CW to or from other nations.
CWC is administered by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
(OPCW), based in The Hague, which is an independent entity working in concert 
with the United Nations. OPCW has a staff of 500 and a budget of EUR 75 million.413
Currently, 188 nations, encompassing 98% of the global population, are party to 
CWC. A mere 13 years old, CWC has enjoyed the fastest rate of accession of any 
arms control treaty in history.414 Since 1997, over 56% of the world’s declared stock-
pile of 71,194 metric tons of chemical agent has been destroyed, along with almost 
50% of the world’s 8.67 million chemical munitions and containers.415
CWC: Lessons for Cyber Conflict
Governments addressed the threat from CW by creating CWC. In order to counter 
the threat posed by cyber attacks and cyber warfare, world leaders may decide to 
create a similar regime, a Cyber Weapons Convention. In that event, international 
negotiators will likely examine CWC to see whether its principles are transferrable 
to the cyber domain. This author has identified five principles characteristic of CWC 
that may be useful in this context: political will, universality, assistance, prohibition, 
and inspection.416
Political will. On March 21, 1997, Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin issued a 
joint statement from Helsinki, stating that they were committed to the ratification of 
413 OPCW website: www.opcw.org.
414 Challenges remain: Angola, Egypt, Israel, Myanmar, North Korea, Somalia, and Syria are still outside 
CWC; the U.S. and Russia are highly unlikely to meet the legally binding CW destruction deadline 
of April 2012; advances in science and technology pose constant challenges to the integrity of the 
inspections regime.
415 OPCW website: www.opcw.org.
416 I derived these five principles in part from the article Mikhail Gorbachev and Rogelio Pfirter wrote for 
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and from Oliver Meier’s interview with Pfirter in Arms Control Today.

NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
CWC in order to “banish poison gas from the Earth.”417 At the end of the Cold War, 
the U.S. and Russia possessed the lion’s share of CW, and CWC could not have been 
a success without their leadership. However, all signatories had to be convinced that 
they had more to gain from joining CWC than they had to lose by remaining outside 
it. In the case of CW, there is a genuine abhorrence that the science of chemistry has 
been used for such lethal purposes, as well as a fear that terrorist groups – who lack 
the accountability of sovereign governments – will obtain CW.
Universality. In 1997, more than two dozen countries possessed CW.418 Further-
more, since CW technology was not difficult to acquire, that number would have 
continued to grow. CWC authors therefore designed the convention as a universal 
treaty with a universal and permanent goal. All nations are encouraged to become 
members, and the treaty’s endgame is the elimination of an entire class of WMD. 
Therefore, CWC represents the broadest possible multilateral security framework. 
At first glance, this strategy could be an obstacle to treaty advancement. However, 
universality also provides a strong recruitment incentive: peer pressure. A higher 
ratio of members to non-members increases one’s sense of security gained by acces-
sion and heightens the isolation felt by those who remain on the outside.
Assistance. OPCW offers enormous practical aid to CWC members. Above all, sig-
natories are helped to fulfill treaty requirements, beginning with the destruction of 
CW and CW production facilities. Further, OPCW actively promotes the advance-
ment of peaceful uses of chemistry for economic development. This includes the 
provision of training for local experts. Finally, OPCW offers advocacy to treaty mem-
bers in the event they are threatened by the CW of another state.
Prohibition. CWC has proven that verifiable destruction of CW and their produc-
tion facilities is feasible. By 2010, over 50% of the world’s declared chemical agent 
stockpiles had been verifiably destroyed, as well as nearly 50% of declared chemical 
munitions. Some states had completely eliminated their CW programs. At the cur-
rent rate, over 90% of the world’s known CW will be destroyed by 2012. Although 
seven nations remain outside CWC, no new states have acquired CW since 1997. 
The success of CWC stands in contrast to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT). Despite the efforts of NPT, the size of the world’s nuclear club has grown from 
five419 to nine.420

Arms Control: Can We Limit Cyber Weapons?
Inspection. Since 1997, almost 4,000 CWC inspections have been conducted on the 
territory of 81 member states in order to verify treaty compliance. These have taken 
place at almost 200 known CW-related sites and at over 1,000 other industrial sites. 
Nearly 5,000 facilities around the world are liable to CWC inspection at any time. 
One of the primary benefits of CWC membership is the right to request a “challenge 
inspection” on the territory of a fellow member state, based on the principle of “any-
time, anywhere,” with no right of refusal.
Toward a Cyber Weapons Convention
Cyber warfare is not chemical warfare. Although they share some similarities – in-
cluding ease of acquisition, asymmetric damage, and polymorphism – the tactics, 
strategies, and effects are fundamentally different. Chemical warfare kills humans; 
cyber warfare kills machines.421
As a means of waging war, however, both chemical and cyber attacks represent a 
potential threat to national security. As such, diplomats may be asked to negotiate 
international agreements designed to mitigate the risk of cyber warfare, just as they 
have done for CW.
The five principles described in the previous section have helped to make CWC a 
success. In this section, the author argues that the first three principles are clearly 
transferable to the cyber domain, while the final two are not.
Political will. International treaties require widespread agreement on the nature of 
a common problem. The threat posed by cyber attacks – based on national capabili-
ties as well as the fear that terrorists will begin to master the art of hacking – could 
be strong enough to form such a political consensus. The 2010 cyber attack on 
Google was serious enough to begin discussion in the U.S. on whether to create an 
ambassador-level post, modeled on the State Department’s counterterrorism coordi-
nator, to oversee international cyber security efforts.422 As with CWC, a convention 
intended to help secure the Internet would need the major world powers behind it 
to succeed. At a minimum, in today’s world that means the U.S., Russia, China, and 
the EU.423
421 To be more specific, cyber attacks usually target the data resident on or functionality of a machine. It 
is also important to note that inoperable machines can kill humans: examples include medical equip-
ment and national air defense systems. By the same token, chemical warfare can also kill flora, fauna, 
and human input to machines.
422 Gorman, 2010.
423 With CWC, the Middle East conflict continues to pose the most serious challenge to worldwide agree-
ment, and it could do the same for a Cyber Weapons Convention.
128
NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Universality. One of the primary challenges to improved computer security is the 
fact that the Internet is a worldwide enterprise. The jurisdiction of law enforcement 
and counterintelligence personnel ends every time a network cable crosses an in-
ternational border. Even though thousands of miles may separate an attacker and 
defender in the real world, everyone is a neighbor in cyberspace, and attackers often 
have direct access to their victims. Smart hackers hide within the maze-like archi-
tecture of the Internet and route attacks through countries with which the victim’s 
government has poor diplomatic relations or no law enforcement cooperation. In 
2010, there are plenty of cyber safe havens where criminals, spies and terrorists can 
operate without fear of reprisal.424 Although the global nature of cyberspace makes 
the practical task of securing the Internet inherently more difficult, the universal 
goals of CWC are highly appropriate in the cyber domain. Politicians, international 
negotiators, and the public will have no trouble understanding this characterization, 
and universality would be a cornerstone of a Cyber Weapons Convention.
Assistance. Vulnerabilities in computer networks and the advantages they create 
for an attacker will persist for the foreseeable future. Consequently, organizations 
have no choice but to invest more time and effort into computer security. However, a 
proper implementation of best practices such as risk management, awareness train-
ing, defense-in-depth, and incident handling425 usually requires more expertise and 
resources than most organizations and even many countries have available. Within 
CWC, OPCW offers practical aid to its members. In the same fashion, a Cyber Weap-
ons Convention could create an internationally-staffed institution dedicated to help-
ing signatories improve their cyber defense posture and respond effectively to cyber 
attacks when they occur. Experts could provide technical, legal, and policy advice 
via consultation and training. A crisis response team could be available to deploy 
worldwide at a moment’s notice, ready to publish its findings to the world. And as 
with CWC, the institution could actively promote the benefits of peaceful uses of 
computer technology for economic development and cooperation.
One significant but difficult step for governments to take would be the joint instru-
mentation and observation of the Internet and its network traffic flows. Many cyber 
threats, such as the one posed by botnet technology, simply move too quickly for 
the kind of traditional inspections that OPCW provides. Cyber attack mitigation re-
quires immediate source identification and the ability to cross technical, legal, and 
national borders quickly. The best chance that future Cyber Weapons Convention

425 For example, the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) offers many free publications 
in the following categories: “General Internet security,” “Securing your computer,” “Recovering from 
an attack,” and “Monthly and quarterly reports” (www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/); however, most 
system administrators simply do not have the time to study, absorb, and implement all such recom-
mendations.
129

monitors would have is with access to real-time network data from across the whole 
of the Internet and the ability to collaborate immediately with treaty-empowered 
colleagues throughout the world.426 National sovereignty and data privacy concerns 
would have to be carefully guarded. Furthermore, the technical and forensic side 
of the regime should be separated as much as possible from its legal and political 
ramifications. Data analysts could not have access to any personally identifiable 
information, but when cyber attacks are observed, the appropriate law enforcement 
organizations must be notified.
Prohibition. The proof that CWC has been a success lies in the large volume of 
CW that has been verifiably destroyed. The principle of prohibition, however, 
would be the most challenging aspect of CWC to apply in cyberspace. Malicious 
computer code is notoriously difficult to define. In the single month of May 2009, 
Kaspersky Anti-Virus Lab found 42,520 “unique malicious, advertising, and poten-
tially unwanted” programs on its clients’ computers.427 Even in a well-designed and 
malware-free network, a legitimate path for remote system administration can be 
used by a masquerading hacker, who has correctly guessed or stolen its password, 
to thoroughly undermine its confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability. Any com-
puter programmer can learn to write malware, and non-programmers can simply 
download professional-quality attack tools from well-known websites. Further, cy-
ber warfare is unlike chemical warfare in that cyber attacks often demand stealth 
and anonymity. At a minimum, any prohibition on malware will require substantial 
progress on solving the cyber attack “attribution” problem.428 This will take time, 
and involve technical, legal, and international cooperation on a level far higher than 
it exists today.
Inspection. Similar to prohibition, the CWC inspection regime has been a success, 
but it is difficult to imagine how the principle of inspection could easily be applied 
in cyberspace. Around the world, 5,000 industrial facilities are subject to CWC in-
spection at any time; this is a large but manageable number. Compare it to the 
amount of digital information that can be placed on one removable thumb drive. In 
2010, a 256 GB USB Flash drive cost under $1000;429 it held over 2 trillion bits of 
data. Even widely-published operating system and application code can be almost 
impossible to understand thoroughly – even for experts – because there is simply 
426 Such an effort would be daunting from a technical perspective, but in theory, if this is possible to 
accomplish in one large country, it should be possible across the globe. On a human level, thousands 
of international CERT personnel already do it on a less formal basis every day.

too much information to analyze.430431 Malware can be written on any computer, 
and transmitted to the Net from any network access point. In the U.S. alone, there 
are 383 million computers connected directly to the Internet.432 In theory, a Cyber 
Weapons Convention could require closer inspection and monitoring at the Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) level. However, such regimes are already commonplace, such 
as China’s Golden Shield Project, the European Convention on Cybercrime, Russia’s 
SORM,433 and the USA PATRIOT Act. Each is unique in terms of guidelines and en-
forcement, but all face the same problem of overwhelming traffic volume.
The Challenges of Prohibition and Inspection
The challenge of securing the Internet appears to be worsening with time.434 World 
leaders may eventually decide that the best way to mitigate the threat posed by cy-
ber attacks is by signing an international cyber arms control treaty.435
The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) constitutes a useful model. It boasts the 
vast majority of world governments as signatories and has tangibly reduced the 
threat of chemical warfare, both by delegitimizing the use of chemical weapons 
(CW) and by dramatically reducing the quantity of CW in existence.
This chapter highlights five principles that have helped to make CWC a success, and 
examines each principle to see whether it could support the development of a Cyber 
Weapons Convention.
