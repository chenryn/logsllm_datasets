**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Data Encoding

Adversaries may use data encoding techniques to obfuscate the content of command and control (C2) traffic, making it more difficult to detect. C2 information can be encoded using standard data encoding systems, which often adhere to existing protocol specifications. Common encoding methods include ASCII, Unicode, Base64, MIME, and other binary-to-text and character encoding systems. Additionally, some encoding systems, such as gzip, also provide data compression, further altering the appearance of the C2 traffic.
