# Network Anomography: Inferring Network-Level Anomalies from Aggregated Data

## Abstract
This paper introduces network anomography, a method for inferring network-level anomalies from widely available data aggregates. We present a powerful framework that separates the anomaly detection component from the inference component, allowing for the development of new algorithms. Our contributions include:
1. A novel framework for anomography.
2. New algorithms within this framework.
3. A dynamic anomography algorithm that tracks both routing and traffic measurements.
4. An evaluation of these methods using extensive data from Internet2’s Abilene network and a Tier-1 ISP.

## 1. Introduction
Network anomography is the problem of inferring network-level anomalies from aggregated data. This paper presents a framework for anomography and evaluates several new algorithms.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Framework for Anomography
We introduce a framework that cleanly separates the anomaly detection component from the inference component. This separation allows for the development of new algorithms and provides a flexible structure for future research.

### 2.2 Novel Algorithms
Within the framework, we propose several novel algorithms, including:
- **ARIMA-based methods**: These methods detect abrupt traffic changes and are effective in identifying the "edges" of anomalous events.
- **FFT and Wavelet-based methods**: These methods leverage signal processing techniques to identify anomalies.
- **PCA-based methods**: These methods use principal component analysis to identify anomalies, but they may have higher false positives due to their inability to fully utilize temporal ordering information.

### 2.3 Dynamic Anomography Algorithm
We develop a dynamic anomography algorithm that tracks both routing and traffic measurements. This algorithm is robust to missing data and can distinguish between internal routing changes and intrinsic traffic anomalies.

## 3. Evaluation

#### Table 2: False Negatives
| Top 50 | Inferred | Diff | ARIMA | EWMA | Holt-Winters | FFT | Wavelet | PCA | TPCA |
|--------|----------|------|-------|------|---------------|-----|---------|-----|------|
| Diff   | 12       | 12   | 12    | 12   | 18            | 11  | 15      | 13  | 16   |

| EWMA  | 5        | 6    | 5     | 6    | 1             | 5   | 19      | 15  | 21   |
| Holt-Winters | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 7 | 0 | 15 | 11 | 19 |
| FFT    | 12       | 12   | 12    | 12   | 18            | 11  | 15      | 13  | 16   |
| Wavelet | 17 | 18 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 13 | 3 | 1 | 8 |
| PCA    | 5        | 6    | 5     | 6    | 1             | 5   | 19      | 15  | 21   |
| TPCA   | 5        | 4    | 5     | 4    | 7             | 0   | 15      | 11  | 19   |

From the tables, we observe that ARIMA, FFT, and Wavelet approaches have relatively low false positives, indicating that the top 30 ranked anomalies detected by these methods are indeed worth investigating. PCA-based approaches, however, exhibit higher false positives, which may be due to their identification of different types of anomalies and their lack of self-consistency.

### 3.2 False Negatives
Table 2 shows the number of false negatives for M = 30 and N = 50. ARIMA, FFT, and Wavelet methods have very low false negatives, indicating that few important traffic anomalies go undetected. PCA-based approaches, on the other hand, identify about half of the anomalies.

## 4. Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced network anomography and presented a framework for developing new algorithms. The results indicate that temporal anomography methods, particularly those using ARIMA and l1 minimization, have high fidelity and robustness. Future work will focus on the feasibility and performance of automated traffic management systems.
