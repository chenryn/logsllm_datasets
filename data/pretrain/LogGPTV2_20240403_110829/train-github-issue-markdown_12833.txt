# Bug report
Webpack v4.12 is not respecting setting the mode via config file.
**What is the current behavior?**
If I set the mode with module.exports in the webpack.config.js, I receive the
configuration warning that the mode is not set.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
If I make a `webpack.config.js` in the root with this configuration:
    module.exports = {
      mode: 'none'
    };
And I run `npm run webpack` via the webpack in scripts in my package.json:
     "scripts": {
        "webpack": "webpack",
      }
But I receive the configuration warning that the mode is not set.
    configuration
      0:0  warning  The 'mode' option has not been set, webpack will fallback to
                    'production' for this value. Set 'mode' option to 'development' or
                    'production' to enable defaults for each environment.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Same exact config sets the mode just fine in v4.8 with no configuration
warning.... but not in v4.12. The webpack documentation does not outline any
sort of changes with this process https://webpack.js.org/concepts/mode/#mode-
none \-- so I'm guessing this is a bug.
