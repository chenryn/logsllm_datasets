Methods in Dates have a habit of causing ambiguities for packages that define
new AbstractArray types, e.g., JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl#18 where nearly
half of the ambiguities are due to Dates-related methods. The problem, in a
nutshell, is that Dates specializes several AbstractArray methods on the
element type whereas packages tend to specialize on the container type.
Getting rid of such ambiguity warnings, back in the days of 0.4-dev, was the
final trigger for introducing `promote_op` (#12292 and #12370); now that we've
gotten rid of it, it would be lovely to see whether we can reduce the
ambiguity-causing footprint of Dates even further.
Now that ambiguities are silent until called this is not as crucial as it once
was, but ideally we'd like to move to a world where packages can include
`detect_ambiguities` as part of their tests.
