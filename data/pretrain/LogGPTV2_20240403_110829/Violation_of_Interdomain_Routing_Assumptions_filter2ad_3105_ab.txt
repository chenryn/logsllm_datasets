### Violation of Interdomain Routing Assumptions

#### 1. Introduction
When observed path lengths differ, we deduce that either (A1) or (A2), or both, have been violated. Since our observations do not allow us to distinguish violations of (A1) from those of (A2), we state that a path length incoherency reveals a violation of the composite assumption (A1 ⊕ A2).

#### 2. Incoherent AS Relationships
We observe incoherent AS relationships as follows:
- According to (A3), an AS assigns higher values of `local_pref` to its customers than to its peers, which in turn receive higher values than providers.
- According to (A4), there is only one relationship between two ASes, meaning each neighboring AS has a single `local_pref` value corresponding to the type of relationship.
- According to (A1), if an AS X performs multi-exit routing through two different ASes Y and Y', the routes learned from these ASes should have the same `local_pref` value.
- According to (A2), Y and Y' must have identical types of relationships with X (e.g., they are both customers of X).

As a consequence, our second criterion is to examine the relationships between an AS and its next-hop ASes in a multi-exit scenario. This requires the availability of an AS relationship database. We consider customer-to-provider (c2p) and peer relationships, excluding the special case of sibling-to-sibling (s2s) relationships without affecting our conclusions. If the relationships differ, we can infer that at least one of the assumptions in the composite set (A1 ⊕ A2 ⊕ A3 ⊕ A4) is violated.

#### 3. Results

##### 3.1 Data Sources
Our study is based on two types of data: BGP updates and AS relationships. We parsed IPv4 BGP updates from BGPmon, which gathers data provided by RouteViews2 and other BGP routers [1]. We analyzed snapshots taken in August 2012, January 2013, March 2013, and August 2013. The results presented here are based on a snapshot taken on 24 March 2013 at 10:00:00 GMT. Table 2 lists some snapshot statistics and results. Other snapshots showed similar results.

To increase the likelihood that each route has had a chance to propagate to all vantage points, we applied a route stability filter. A route is considered stable if it is the last one received by a BGP router concerning a prefix and has been received at least 24 hours ago without being withdrawn. This filter slightly undercounts multi-exits, but its effect on overall results is negligible.

We also removed any ASNs reported by CAIDA [3] to belong to Internet exchange points (IXPs), as they do not play a role in the routing policy of the ASes they interconnect.

There is limited publicly available ground truth for AS relationships. From the projects that aim to infer them, we chose CAIDA’s relationship dataset [3] because it is the only one with a fully public methodology. For the 34.6% of their inferences that they were able to validate, they report accuracy of 99.6% for c2p relationships and 98.7% for peer relationships [17].

##### 3.2 Quantifying Multi-Exits
We observed 204,423 multi-exits, each typically having 2, but sometimes up to 5, next-hop ASes. These constitute 2.7% of the (AS, destination prefix) pairs in our database, suggesting that multi-exits might seem rare. However, 21% of the 6,762 transit ASes in our dataset were performing multi-exit routing. We found multi-exits in the top 38 ASes in CAIDA’s AS ranking [2], including all tier-1 ASes. Thus, multi-exit observations reveal information about ASes that play a central role in Internet routing.

##### 3.3 Quantifying Incoherences
Fully 63% of the multi-exits in our dataset show incoherencies. AS path length incoherencies, implying a violation of the composite assumption (A1 ⊕ A2), appeared in 57% of multi-exits. AS relationship incoherencies, implying a violation of (A1 ⊕ A2 ⊕ A3 ⊕ A4), appeared in 33% of the multi-exits. There is overlap, with 27% of multi-exits revealing both kinds of incoherency.

##### 3.4 Possible Causes for Violations
We speculate on reasons for these assumptions to be violated:
- **Traffic Engineering**: Contemporary traffic engineering practices may not fully align with the assumptions. An AS might prefer to send some traffic through a peer rather than a customer, or through a provider rather than a peer, intentionally violating (A3). This could happen when the customer has insufficient bandwidth or when a router in a large AS is geographically closer to a peer than to a customer.
- **Complex or Hybrid AS Relationships**: Previous work [15,17] has highlighted the existence of complex or hybrid relationships, where one large AS might be another’s peer on one continent and its customer elsewhere. Such relationships violate (A4) and require (A2) to be violated.
- **Misconfigurations**: A router misconfiguration might cause any of the assumptions to be violated. For example, an incorrect `local_pref` value could result in an AS inadvertently favoring a provider over a customer, violating (A3).
- **Erroneous AS Relationships**: It is possible that the assumptions are not violated as often as our results indicate, but rather that CAIDA’s database is not indicating the correct AS relationships. However, this would need to be incorrect in a large portion of cases to change our overall conclusions.

#### 4. Related Work
Many papers in the literature [5–17] have employed various assumptions about interdomain routing. Some of these papers, as well as others, have looked at violations of these assumptions.

- **Feamster et al. [18]**: Provide examples of violations of (A1).
- **Gill et al. [19]**: Found that 77% of ASes do not modify the `local_pref` value, coherent with (A2), and 87% are coherent with (A3).
- **Mühlbauer et al. [9]**: Revealed violations of (A3) by comparing actual and expected routes.
- **Giotsas et al. [20]**: Showed that relationships between pairs of ASes for IPv4 routes differ in 13% of cases from those for IPv6 routes.
- **Roughan et al. [21]**: Summarized lessons about modeling ASes, noting that modeling an AS interconnection by a single connection is insufficient.
- **Mühlbauer et al. [8]**: Highlighted the weaknesses in modeling an AS as an atomic entity.

Our work goes further by providing a method for detecting violations of commonly employed assumptions using publicly available data. We supply the first quantification of the extent of observable violations.

Our finding that violations can be observed in a large portion of transit ASes, including all of the biggest ones, does not mean that previous work making simplifying assumptions should be considered invalid. Most work on AS relationship inference [5,11–17] makes only assumption (A4). Our method does not allow us to specify precisely which of a set of assumptions have been violated, so we cannot say how often (A4) in particular does not hold. Furthermore, if (A4) is violated, it might not be to a degree that would change previous results.

Our results might pose more serious questions for other work. Javed et al. [10] use the four assumptions to reduce the set of ASes that may be the root cause for a routing event in the network. If the assumptions are violated, the final set might not contain the root cause AS. Buob et al. [6] aim to solve a problem in which the assumptions are respected.

#### 5. Conclusion and Future Work
This paper formalized four assumptions about interdomain routing in the Internet that are commonly used in the literature. We employed a data-driven method to challenge these assumptions, making novel use of so-called "multi-exit" scenarios to reveal incoherencies between sets of these assumptions and actual interdomain routing decisions. We observed multi-exits in 21% of transit ASes in a BGP snapshot from March 2013, and found that in 63% of these multi-exits at least one assumption is violated. Other snapshots showed similar results. Given this, we believe that future work should use these assumptions with caution.

We expect that our technique of using multi-exits to reveal characteristics of interdomain routing behavior can be further developed. Studying how they change over time could tell us more about how ASes perform traffic engineering. We also believe that much more can be revealed by combining BGP data with IP-level measurements, which is part of our future work.
