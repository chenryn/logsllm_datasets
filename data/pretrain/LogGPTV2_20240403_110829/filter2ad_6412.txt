1. Introduction 
and 
the  emergence  of  many-core  processors, 
With 
alternative/heterogeneous 
accelerators, 
architectures, 
the  HPC  community  faces  a  new 
challenge:  a  scaling  in  number  of  processing  elements 
that  supersedes  the  historical  trend  of  scaling  in 
processor frequencies. The attendant increase in system 
complexity  has  first-order 
implications  for  fault 
tolerance.  Mounting  evidence  invalidates  traditional 
assumptions  of  HPC  fault 
tolerance:  faults  are 
increasingly  multiple-point  instead  of  single-point  and 
interdependent  instead  of  independent;  silent  failures 
and silent data corruption are no longer rare enough to 
discount;  stabilization  time  consumes  a  larger  fraction 
of useful system lifetime, with failure rates projected to 
exceed  one  per  hour  on  the  largest  systems;  and 
application  interrupt  rates  are  apparently  diverging 
from system failure rates. 
The workshop will convene a diverse group of experts 
in  HPC  and  fault-tolerance  to  inaugurate  a  fault-
tolerance research agenda for responding to the unique 
challenges 
scale  and  complexity. 
Innovation  is  encouraged  and  discussion  of  non-
traditional approaches is welcome. 
2. Inaugural Workshop 
that  extreme 
Assuming  hardware  and  software  errors  will  be 
inescapable  at  extreme  scale,  this  workshop  will 
consider  aspects  of  fault  tolerance  peculiar  to  extreme 
scale that include, but are not limited to: 
•  Quantitative assessments of cost in terms of power, 
performance, and resource impacts of fault-tolerant 
techniques,  such  as  checkpoint  restart,  that  are 
redundant in space, time or information; 
•  Novel 
techniques 
fault-tolerance 
and 
implementations  of  emerging  hardware  and 
software technologies that guard against silent data 
corruption  (SDC)  in  memory,  logic,  and  storage 
and  provide  end-to-end  data  integrity  for  running 
applications; 
•  Studies  of  hardware  /  software  tradeoffs  in  error 
detection,  failure  prediction,  error  preemption,  and 
recovery; 
•  Advances  in  monitoring,  analysis,  and  control  of 
highly complex systems; 
•  Highly scalable fault-tolerant programming models; 
•  Metrics  and  standards  for  measuring,  improving 
and  enforcing  the  need  for  and  effectiveness  of 
fault-tolerance; 
•  Failure  modeling  and 
scalable  methods  of 
reliability,  availability,  performability  and  failure 
prediction for fault-tolerant HPC systems; 
•  Scalable  Byzantine  fault  tolerance  and  security 
from single-fault and fail-silent violations;
