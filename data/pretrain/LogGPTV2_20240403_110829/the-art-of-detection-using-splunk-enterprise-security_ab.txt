## Network Sessions and BYOD Devices
### Attribution of Network Activity to Specific Users/Devices
- **Network Sessions Lookup**:
  - **Source**: VPN session / DHCP lease start events
  - **Method**: KVStore Collection-based temporal lookup
  - **Update**: Appended by a scheduled search run every few minutes
  - **Pruning**: Another scheduled search periodically removes old sessions to manage the lookup size
  - **Fields**: `start`, `src_mac`, `src_ip`, `user`, `nt_host`, `assigned_ip`

- **User Endpoints Lookup**:
  - **Source**: Authentication events with `src_ip`
  - **Method**: KVStore Collection-based lookup
  - **Update**: Appended by a periodic scheduled search
  - **MAC Address Determination**: Uses the Network Sessions lookup
  - **Fields**: `key(network_session_src_mac)`, `os_type`, `nt_host`, `user`, `updated`
  - **Features**: Automatically learns about devices, their last usage, and ownership
  - **ES Asset Source**: Mirrors the user that owns the device

**Note**: Ensure that your events are accurate and not misleading.

## Notable Comment-derived Dynamic Enrichment
- **Fixed Fields in Notables**: Analysts often find additional information during triage.
- **Dynamic Field Addition**: Allows for dynamic field values to be added, enabling pivoting and reusing analyst time effectively.
- **User Association**: Associating a notable with a user allows it to appear in their swimlane.
- **Free-form Prose**: Use Key-Value pairs according to CIM-based taxonomy.

## Scheduled Search to Build Extraction Lookup
```spl
| `incident_review` 
| rename comment as _raw 
| extract mv_add=true 
| rename _raw as comment 
| search user=* OR src_ip=* OR ... 
| stats values(user) as user values(src) as src ... by rule_id 
| mvexpand 
| outputlookup incident_review_comment_extractions
```

## Dynamic Notable Enrichment
- **Macro Configuration** (SA-ThreatIntelligence/local/macros.conf):
  ```conf
  [notable_by_id(1)]
  definition = `get_notable_index` \
  | `get_event_id` \
  | search event_id="$event_id$" \
  | ...
  ```
- **Custom Commands for Enrichment**:
  ```spl
  | lookup user_watchlist _key AS user OUTPUT start AS watchlist_start, end AS watchlist_end, reason AS watchlist_reason, comment AS watchlist_comment, creator AS watchlist_creator
  | eval watchlist=if(isnotnull(watchlist_start), if(watchlist_start_time, watchlist_reason + ": " + if(isnull(watchlist_comment), "no comment", watchlist_comment) + " (" + watchlist_creator + ")", "On watchlist either before or after this notable"), null())
  ```

## Customizations
### E-mail Workflow Action
- **Workflow Actions**: Links that can be URL-encoded `mailto:` links with tokens.
- **E-mail Templates**: Auto-populate e-mails and allow PGP signing.

### Risk Object Value
- **Purpose**: Sort notable tables and search across notables.
- **Implementation**: Use `eval` in correlation searches to add a `risk_object_value` field.
- **Configuration**: Add a "Table Attribute" via the "Incident Review Settings" dashboard.
  ```spl
  ... | eval risk_object_value=if(like(src_ip,"10.%"),src_ip,dest_ip)
  ```

### Custom Identity and Asset Information
- **Common Complaint**: Inability to add arbitrary identity/asset information.
- **Solution**: Create a CSV lookup and apply it to the `[default]` stanza in `props.conf`.
  ```conf
  LOOKUP-zd_identities_supplementary = identities_supplementary user
  ```

### User Watchlist Editor
- **Functionality**: Interface to add, edit, and remove watchlist users and metadata.
- **Integration**: Can be integrated with ES Identity sources.
  ```spl
  | lookup user_watchlist _key AS identity OUTPUT end AS watchlist_end
  | eval watchlist=if(isnotnull(watchlist_end), if(watchlist_end>now(), "true", null()), null())
  | fields - watchlist_end
  ```

### User and Asset Investigator Dashboards
- **Custom Swimlanes**: Change in behavior detection.

## Case Study: Third Man Correlation Search
### The Idea
- **Objective**: Detect the use of phished credentials.
- **Rationale**: Humans are predictable, so changes in patterns can be detected.

### The Source
- **Scope and Abstraction**:
  ```spl
  eval period=case(date_hour2
  ```

### The Triage
- **Fields and Documentation**:
  - `user`, `src_ip`, `src_as`, `dest`, `app`, `unique_vectors`, `unique_vector_count`
- **Analysis and Enrichment**:
  - Drilldown search to a table of the user’s authentication activity
- **Actions and Remediation**:
  - Raise a notable
  - Aggregate risk, scaled dynamically in-line by the number of unique vectors
  - Place the user on a watchlist
- **Fidelity and Refinement**:
  - Check for apps or other vector values to filter out
  - Check CIM normalization for inconsistencies
  - Consider extending the earliest time to improve fidelity

## Bonus Material
### UTC Field in All Events/Notables
- **Purpose**: Geographically distributed security teams need a common time, especially for evidence extraction.
- **Configuration**:
  ```conf
  [default]
  EVAL-utc = strftime(_time - (60 * 60 * tonumber(substr(strftime(_time,"%z"),2,2))) + (60 * tonumber(substr(strftime(_time,"%z"),4,2))), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")
  ```

### `_raw` Search in Incident Review Dashboard
- **Issue**: Much of the information in notables is not searchable without knowing field names.
- **Solution**: Recreate `_raw` to include all enrichment fields using the JSON Tools app.
- **Macro Modification**:
  ```spl
  | mkjson
  ```
  - Must be placed before the `$event_id$` search command but after enrichment.

Now, the notable search works like core Splunk search.
