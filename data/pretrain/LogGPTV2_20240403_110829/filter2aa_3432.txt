- **Objective**: Utilize widely deployed coaxial cabling to deliver content.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Shielded
    - High frequency bandwidth
    - Signal transmission up to 500 feet

### Specifications
- **PHY/MAC Specification**: 
  - Creates a network using the coaxial bus.
  - Delivers guaranteed bandwidths at certain distances.

### MoCA Operation: PHY
- **Physical Layer (PHY)**: The coaxial cable.
- **Frequencies and Signaling**:
  - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
  - WAN and LAN channel sets

### MoCA Operation: MAC
- **Media Access Control (MAC)**:
  - Scheduled frames
  - Master node controller
  - Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
  - Assured speeds

### PHY and MAC Rates
| PHY Rate (Mbps) | Minimum MAC Rate (Mbps) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| ≥275            | 139.87                  |
| 250             | 130.78                  |
| 225             | 119.45                  |
| 200             | 107.74                  |
| 175             | 95.64                   |
| 150             | 81.98                   |
| 125             | 68.32                   |
| 100             | 54.65                   |
| 75              | 39.82                   |

### Key Features of MoCA
- **Triple Play Enablement**: Supports Internet, TV, and phone services.
- **ISP Preference**: Desired by ISPs for HDTV requirements and guaranteed speeds.
- **Widespread Deployment**: More prevalent than many realize, often used in North American and European broadband installations.
  - **Common Providers**:
    - FIOS
    - Cable/Xfinity
    - Dish/Satellite
    - DVR
    - Set-Top Box (STB)

### The Wall Wart
- **Optical Cable**: Runs from the neighborhood splicer to the home.
- **Optical Network Terminator (ONT)**: Installed on the exterior of the home.
  - **Function**: Bridges fiber to coaxial or CAT5 cable.
  - **ISP Preference**: Coaxial for MoCA.

### MoCA Inside
- **Accton Router**:
  - SPI firewall
  - NAT router
- **LAN and WAN**:
  - 2 MoCA nodes (NC)
  - MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge
- **Digital Video Recorder (DVR)**:
  - Onboard MoCA networking
  - Dependent on Accton router
- **Additional Features**:
  - Time synchronization
  - TV channel data

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- **No Keys Required**: Easy access to the MoCA network.
- **Utility Point of Presence**: ONT + root coax splicer + power = potential entry point.
- **Cover and Concealment**: Low plants around equipment can provide cover for attackers.

### Tools of the Trade
- **MoCA-to-Ethernet Bridge**
- **RG-6 Coaxial Cable**
- **>1GHz Coaxial Splicer**

### Exploitation Process
- **Connecting the Attack Device**: Connect the attack device to the bridge’s Ethernet interface.
- **Network Extension**: By accessing the MoCA LAN, the internal Ethernet LAN is extended outside the home.

### Security Implications
- **Firewall Bypass**: Enables attacks that are typically blocked by a firewall.
- **Network Redirection**:
  - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning
  - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) response spoofing
  - Domain Name System (DNS) hijacking
- **Traffic Profiling**:
  - Deep packet inspection
  - Monitoring of user activities
- **Retro Attacks**: Reintroduction of old Ethernet-based attacks.

### Mitigation and Protection
- **MoCA Filters**: Block signals in the MoCA range, marketed as a security layer.
- **Typical Placement**: Located on the feed to the splicer, often exposed.
- **Design Purpose**: Prevent signal bleed between houses, not between interior and exterior walls.

### Building a Disposable Attack Unit
- **Problem Statement**: Automate the compromise of a MoCA network.
- **Requirements**:
  - Physical toolkit
  - Power source
  - Computing device
  - Remote access
  - Traffic redirection
  - Content manipulation
- **Design Objectives**:
  - No harm: Educational purposes only.
  - Use standard tools.
  - Minimize power consumption.
  - Control costs.

### Ingredients
- **Cellphone Recharging Battery**: Gorilla 16,800 mAh
- **Raspberry Pi**: Model B with 512 MB RAM
- **Kali Linux**: Standard penetration testing distribution
- **Squid, Apache, miniupnp**: Available for ARM, including Raspberry Pi
- **Netgear MCAB1001**: MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge

### Modifying the MCAB1001
- **Power Efficiency**: Direct Current (DC) conversion for better hang-time.
- **Battery Life**: Up to 14 hours for a 3V device.

### Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP)
- **Service Discovery**: Enabled on broadcast domains via UDP port 1900.
- **Security Concerns**: No authentication, no routing required, everything just broadcasts.

### Internet Gateway Device (IGD)
- **UPnP Protocol**: Eases manipulation of firewall rules.
- **Features**:
  - Adjusts firewall posture based on internal host requests.
  - Forwards requested ports and sets up NAT.
  - Supported by Microsoft, DLNA, and ISPs.

### Redirect Hijinks
- **Transparent Proxy**: Needed to manipulate web streams.
- **Tools**:
  - Squid for URL rewriting
  - Perl scripts for URL manipulation
  - Josh Wright’s wireless honeypot distribution for image flipping and other manipulations.

### Recipe for Raspberry MoCA
- **Phase 1**: Insertion and remote access.
  - Execute a UPnP command to forward an external port to the local SSH server.
  - Report information to the attacker.
- **Phase 2**: Engage HTTP manipulation.
  - ARP poison the LAN.
  - Redirect web streams to a local proxy.
  - Manipulate the web stream.

### Results
- **Performance**: ARM11 is single-core, suitable for basic tasks but slow for large image processing.
- **Traffic Redirection**: Successfully redirected traffic with minimal performance issues.
- **Payload Injections**: Efficient for static payload insertion, less so for large images.

### Security Needs
- **Exposure**: MoCA implementation presents a major exposure of the physical transport layer.
- **Weaknesses**: IGD weakens firewall protections, bridging networks introduces new vulnerabilities.
- **Action Required**: Reassessment and attention from cable installers and internet providers.
- **Consumer Awareness**: Consumers should demand better security.

### Ongoing Work
- **Detection and Alerts**: Develop methods to detect MoCA injections and alert on network insertion.
- **Collaboration**: SLIM and CounterPi projects in collaboration with Stephan Browarny.
