**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
Build script fails
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
    if (false) {
        import('./module'); //  v8.1.3
I came across this issue because we use feature flags at build time that
include specific code if feature is enabled.
