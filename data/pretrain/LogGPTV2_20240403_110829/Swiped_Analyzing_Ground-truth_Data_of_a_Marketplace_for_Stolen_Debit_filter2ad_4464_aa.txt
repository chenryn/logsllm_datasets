Abstract
This paper presents the ﬁrst empirical study of ground-truth
data from a major underground shop selling stolen credit
and debit cards. To date, there is little quantitative knowledge
about how this segment of the underground economy operates,
despite it causing fraud losses estimated at billions of dollars
a year. Our analysis of four years of leaked transactional
data allows us to characterize this shop’s business model,
sellers, customers, and ﬁnances. The shop earned close to
$104 M in gross revenue, and listed over 19 M unique card
numbers for sale. Around 97% of the inventory was stolen
magnetic stripe data, commonly used to produce counterfeit
cards for in-person payments. Perhaps surprisingly, customers
purchased only 40% of this inventory. In contrast, the shop
sold 83% of its card-not-present inventory, used for online
fraud, which appeared to be in short supply. Demand and
pricing were not uniform, as buyers appeared to perceive
some banks as having weaker countermeasures against fraud.
Even multiple years into the U.S. EMV chip deployment, the
supply of stolen magnetic stripe data continued to increase
sharply. In particular, we identiﬁed a continuing supply of
newly issued cards not equipped with EMV chips, especially
among prepaid cards. Our ﬁndings suggest that improvements
to EMV chip deployment in the U.S., combined with a limited
supply of stolen card-not-present data, could be avenues to
decreasing the revenue and proﬁtability of this shop.

Introduction
Fraud due to counterfeit credit and debit cards is a grow-
ing problem, estimated at 20 billion dollars worldwide for
2018 [10]. These losses were not distributed evenly. E.U.
countries experienced some of the lowest levels of fraud, and
the U.S. some of the highest [10]. This is largely attributed to
the E.U.’s early adoption of anti-counterfeit chip technology
EMV. The U.S. introduced EMV only relatively recently, and
has not yet achieved comprehensive deployment. In Octo-
ber 2015, liability for counterfeit card payments shifted to
merchants failing to process chip payments [6, 19]. Yet, the
U.S. Federal Reserve estimated that in 2018, 43.3% of card-
present (in-person) payments were still processed by reading
the magnetic stripe instead of a chip [8].
For card-present payments, counterfeit cards are typically
produced by encoding magnetic stripe data stolen from au-
thentic cards. Magnetic stripe data may be stolen through
breaches of merchants’ Point of Sale (PoS) terminals [26], or
using skimmers installed in ATMs [36] and gas pumps [16,35].
Often, the data is then resold in forums and marketplaces.
Much of the prior academic work has focused on the
communities behind this fraud [11, 21, 24, 31, 41, 44], and
on developing methods to detect physical skimming de-
vices [16,35,36] or cloned magnetic stripe cards [37]. Several
industry studies have been able to provide insights into pricing
based on data scraped from carding shops dedicated to selling
stolen credit and debit card data [9, 12, 22]. A key limitation
of these studies was that they were based on external mea-
surements with limited visibility into internal operations. For
example, to date there is little understanding of the ﬁnancial
aspects and proﬁtability of such shops, and we do not know
which parts of a shop’s inventory are actually purchased.
This paper presents the ﬁrst empirical case study based on
ground-truth data of a major shop selling stolen credit and
debit cards with a focus on the U.S. market. The data was
leaked in a breach of the carding shop. When we received
a copy of the database, we needed to reverse engineer its
schema, and conducted internal and external validity checks
to assess its authenticity.
The leaked database covers the period from January 2015
to January 2019. During this time, the shop earned close
to $104 M in gross revenue, and listed over 19 M unique
card numbers (stolen accounts) for sale. The majority (97%)
of the inventory was stolen magnetic stripe data. Perhaps
counterintuitively, magnetic stripe supply increased after the
EMV liability shift; in 2018 and 2019, the shop added an
average of 93,600 stolen magnetic stripe accounts per week.
This supports reports that large-scale breaches of PoS systems
are fairly common [26–28].

We conducted an analysis of EMV deployment in the U.S.
from the perspective of the carding shop. In the last two years
of the leaked data, 85% of the stolen magnetic stripe data
originated from EMV chip-enabled cards. This suggests that
current incentives might be insufﬁcient to reduce risky use
and acceptance of magnetic stripe transactions. Furthermore,
even three years after the liability shift, there still was a small
but persistent supply of newly issued cards without chips,
especially among prepaid cards.1 Such non-EMV accounts
saw much greater demand than EMV accounts, and made up
30.4% of the shop’s gross revenue after the liability shift.
Out of the over 19 M accounts listed in the shop, 60% did
not sell, despite prices starting at only 21 cents. We inves-
tigated what made such a large fraction of stolen accounts
apparently undesirable for carders, and found that they pre-
ferred to purchase magnetic stripe accounts issued by certain
banks but not others. In particular, carders appeared to prefer
accounts from medium-sized and smaller banks. This sug-
gests that buyers perceived differences in anti-fraud measures.
We estimate that the shop earned $24 M before labor and
infrastructure costs, with proﬁts growing consistently over
the years. Revenue from stolen magnetic stripe data was
ﬂat in 2017 and 2018, but it still accounted for 92.2% of
gross revenue in 2018. The top 5 magnetic stripe buyers
in 2018 spent over $100 k each on stolen magnetic stripe
accounts, indicating that they were likely able to evade EMV
and transactional risk-based anti-fraud measures.
Around 3% of the shop’s inventory was card-not-present
data used for online fraud. Supply and demand were increas-
ing, but these accounts only made up 7.8% of gross revenue
in the last year of the leaked data. The shop paid sellers higher
commission rates for stolen card-not-present accounts, yet it
appeared unable to attract supply at the same level as mag-
netic stripe accounts. Based on the perspective of this one
shop, it appeared to be more difﬁcult in the U.S. to steal large
amounts of card-not-present accounts as opposed to magnetic
stripe accounts.
This paper makes the following contributions:
• We characterize the behavior of buyers, and show on
the basis of pricing and demand that buyers had clear
preferences among card issuers and card types.
• We study the state of U.S. EMV deployment through the
lens of this shop. While effects of EMV were visible, de-
ployment had no major impact on the shop’s prosperity.
2 Background
The sale of stolen payment cards online has a long history.
It has been conducted in public Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
channels [21] and underground forums [11, 24, 31, 34]. More
recently, payment card sales have migrated away from these

only funds deposited into the associated prepaid account can be spent.

accounts (payment card data) from suppliers who presumably

payment systems. Shop customers buy accounts for use in
fraudulent purchases or for resale. This paper focuses on the

ad-hoc channels to more streamlined, dedicated carder shop
websites [29]. These carder shops have functionality and a
degree of automation similar to their legitimate e-commerce
counterparts. For example, carder shops feature automated
customer account creation, a search interface for available
payment cards, shopping carts, automated checkout and pay-
ment, automated refunds, and ticket-based customer support.
This new carder shop structure has created specializations
and likely efﬁciencies in the ecosystem. As Figure 1 illus-
trates, it is no longer the case that the person stealing the cards
has to deal with the rest of the sales process. Instead, carder
shops, including the one that we study, are often market plat-
forms where multiple sellers provide stolen payment cards
on consignment to the shop operators. The carder shop pays
the sellers a commission for each sale, and handles tasks such
as vetting of sellers, advertising of the shop on underground
forums, building and maintaining the website infrastructure,
payment processing, and customer support. This platform
structure is also used in other illegitimate markets such as
drug sales [20, 38] and bullet proof hosting [33].

The shop that we study in this paper has been in operation
since 2015, and can be reached at a regular Internet domain
name. As indicated in the leak, it was run by two adminis-
trators. To become a customer, users create an account and
make a deposit. While paid in Bitcoin, the balance (and the
prices in the shop) are marked in U.S. dollars. Customers can
search the shop’s inventory according to features such as the
card network (e.g., MasterCard or Visa), type (e.g., business
or gold), bank, zip code, or price. This enables buyers to
identify cards they believe to be more likely to complete the
intended fraudulent transaction. Upon purchase, they have
the option to check the validity of a card for $0.50. The card
“checker” presumably requests authorization for a small test
purchase using the card data. If authorization fails, the buyer
obtains an automatic refund for the card. (Certain card types
are not eligible for refunds, and the shop places time restric-
tions and upper limits on how many refunds a single buyer
can obtain.) It is worth noting that the shop sells each card
only once, to give the buyer conﬁdence that it has not been
previously used for fraud. The shop is continually restocked
with new releases of stolen cards. The most loyal customers
enjoy exclusive access to new cards for the ﬁrst hours after
release, and receive a discount on all their purchases. Based
on a review of conversations in the customer support ticketing
system, it appears that prices, and discounts for older stock,
are set by the shop. Supply is provided by external sellers,
who negotiate their commission with the shop.
2.2 Payment Cards, Authorization and Fraud
When we refer to stolen payment cards in this paper, we do
not mean cards that have been physically stolen. Instead, they
have had some of their data copied, which would allow their
use or cloning without access to the original card. Payment
cards are typically identiﬁed by their number and expiration
date. We refer to this data as a stolen account. The ﬁrst six
digits of the card number are the Bank Identiﬁcation Number
(BIN), indicating the card network and the issuing bank. In
some cases, the card network issues all or most of the cards; in
other cases, the network acts as an umbrella for independent
banks and their technical service providers.
In order to prevent fraud, a payment usually cannot be pro-
cessed with knowledge of the card number and expiration
date alone. What exactly is needed to authorize a payment
depends on various circumstances, including whether the pay-
ment is processed with the card present or the card not present,
the physical security features of the card, such as magnetic
stripe, contact chip or contactless, the capabilities of the de-
vice reading the card, and the policies and anti-fraud measures
implemented by the involved parties such as the merchant,
the merchant’s payment processor, the card network, and the
issuing bank.
A fragmented ecosystem and differing anti-fraud mech-
anisms imply that opportunities for fraud are not uniform.
Carders frequently share strategies for monetizing stolen cards
and avoiding anti-fraud systems. These tips include attempt-
ing fraudulent transactions close to where the legitimate card
owner likely lives, selecting banks perceived to have less
effective anti-fraud systems, and making speciﬁc types of pur-
chases that target gaps in these systems. To wit, underground
carding forum members frequently sell lists of BINs that are
thought to be more vulnerable to fraudulent transactions.
In the following, we brieﬂy discuss the differences between
card-present and card-not-present payment authorization, and
which card data is typically required during the authorization
process. We base these deﬁnitions on the manner in which
stolen accounts were marketed on the shop.
Card Present (Magnetic Stripe). In this scenario, the pay-
ment card is physically read by the merchant’s point of sale
(PoS) system. Traditionally, this meant “swiping” the card
to read the track data encoded in the magnetic stripe, which
includes the card number, expiration date, cardholder name,
and CVV1. The card veriﬁcation value CVV1 is only encoded
on the magnetic stripe but not visible or typically known to
the cardholder; when authorizing transactions, it is used as
an indicator that the magnetic stripe of a card has been read.
Since magnetic stripe data is static, it is trivial to clone cards
for fraudulent use. Countermeasures include the introduc-
tion of contactless and contact chip (EMV) technology [1–4].
However, adoption of EMV technology in the U.S. has lagged
behind other countries [43] with only 57% of 2018 U.S. card
present transactions processed using EMV [8]. Although
vulnerabilities have been discovered in the EMV speciﬁca-
tion [17, 32], we did not ﬁnd any indications of these being
exploited in the leaked data.
The shop calls data stolen during card-present transactions
“dumps;” we refer to them as magnetic stripe accounts to dis-
tinguish from chip-based attacks. The shop also contains data
stolen from chip cards, but we believe that this data originates
from reading the cards’ magnetic stripe despite the presence
of the chip. (Chips are protected against cloning through pri-
vate data that cannot be read by the terminal, and the publicly
readable chip data contains an iCVV instead of the CVV1
that is encoded in the magnetic stripe data.) Magnetic stripe
data is commonly stolen from compromised PoS systems [26]
or with physical card skimmers installed in ATMs and gas
pumps [16, 35, 36]. Some skimmers additionally record PINs
needed for ATM withdrawals, but we do not consider this
category in our analysis since only 5,801 (0.03%) accounts
with PINs were for sale in the shop.
Card Not Present (CNP). This authorization method is used
in scenarios where the card cannot be physically present, such
as in online shopping. It requires information visually present
on the card, or known to the cardholder. All transactions
require the card’s account number, and many online payment
processors also verify the expiration date, CVV2, and billing

zip code. Some banks may request additional second-factor
authentication before authorizing online payments, such as a
one-time code sent to the cardholder’s phone. This require-
ment appears to be most common among international banks
but not in the U.S., the main market of the shop that we study.
In carder slang, this type of stolen payment data is called
“cards” or “CVV2s,” we refer to it as CNP accounts. The
CVV2 is a card veriﬁcation value printed on the card, but
not electronically encoded and therefore not automatically
read during payments in brick-and-mortar stores. The billing
zip code is not present on the card. By design, CNP autho-
rization data is chosen such that it cannot be used for card
present authorization, and vice versa. As a result, stolen CNP
data typically originates from compromised online merchants,
their payment processors, or end host malware infections that
steal card information entered into a website. If an online
payment processor does not verify the CVV2 and billing zip
code, scammers can also attempt to use magnetic stripe data
for online purchases.
2.3 Related Work
The ecosystem of carder shops includes hundreds of sellers,
and thousands of buyers. While the mechanics of the older
IRC and underground forum business models are described in
prior work [11,16,21,24,31,41,44], the dynamics of the actors
and the underlying constants that deﬁne the present economics
are not well understood. Prior work [12, 22, 38, 42] has used
limited scraped data to describe some of what is offered for
