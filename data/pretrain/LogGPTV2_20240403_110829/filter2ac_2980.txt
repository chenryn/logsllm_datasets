### Title: Blackhat EU-21 BadMesher: New Attack Surfaces in Wi-Fi Mesh Networks

With the proliferation of internet-connected devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has seen a significant rise in both application and research. Wi-Fi networks, as a critical component of IoT infrastructure, provide essential communication services for these devices. Wi-Fi Mesh technology, in particular, offers advantages such as self-organization, self-management, and self-healing, enhancing the flexibility and reliability of traditional networks.

In this session, we will begin by discussing EasyMesh, a standard designed and certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance. We will then delve into the security challenges associated with the implementation of Wi-Fi Mesh networks. Specifically, we will focus on the attack surfaces in network build and network control, and share attack strategies for different roles within the Wi-Fi Mesh ecosystem.

Our research will highlight the types of memory corruption vulnerabilities that can arise from the parsing of Type-Length-Value (TLV) structures. To address these issues, we have developed an automated fuzzing tool called MeshFuzzer. We will present the design of MeshFuzzer, including the challenges encountered during its implementation. Additionally, we will discuss how MeshFuzzer comprehensively covers all roles and stages in a Wi-Fi Mesh network.

In practice, we have evaluated MeshFuzzer on the MT7915 Wi-Fi chipset, which is the worldâ€™s first single-chip solution supporting both 'Wi-Fi 6 Wave 1 Plus' and 'Bluetooth 5,' and is well-suited for EasyMesh. Our tool has successfully identified several memory corruption vulnerabilities, leading to the assignment of 19 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). We will detail some of the typical vulnerabilities found in the network build and network control phases.

Finally, we will provide safety recommendations and outline future research directions to enhance the security of Wi-Fi Mesh networks.
