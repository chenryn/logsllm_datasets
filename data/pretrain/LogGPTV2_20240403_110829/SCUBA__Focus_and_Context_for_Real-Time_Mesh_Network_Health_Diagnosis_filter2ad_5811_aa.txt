Abstract. Large-scale wireless metro-mesh networks consisting of hundreds of
routers and thousands of clients suffer from a plethora of performance problems.
The sheer scale of such networks, the abundance of performance metrics, and the
absence of effective tools can quickly overwhelm a network operators’ ability to
diagnose these problems. As a solution, we present SCUBA, an interactive focus
and context visualization framework for metro-mesh health diagnosis. SCUBA
places performance metrics into multiple tiers or contexts, and displays only the
topmost context by default to reduce screen clutter and to provide a broad con-
textual overview of network performance. A network operator can interactively
focus on problem regions and zoom to progressively reveal more detailed con-
texts only in the focal region. We describe SCUBA’s contexts and its planar and
hyperbolic views of a nearly 500 node mesh to demonstrate how it eases and ex-
pedites health diagnosis. Further, we implement SCUBA on a 15-node testbed,
demonstrate its ability to diagnose a problem within a sample scenario, and dis-
cuss its deployment challenges in a larger mesh. Our work leads to several future
research directions on focus and context visualization and efﬁcient metrics col-
lection for fast and efﬁcient mesh network health diagnosis1.

1 Introduction
Metro-scale wireless mesh networks (WMNs)2, consisting of hundreds of routers, are
being deployed worldwide in city downtowns, malls, and residential areas3. While sev-
eral millions of dollars have been spent to deploy WMNs, these networks suffer from
a plethora of problems that severely impact their performance. Some of the most com-
mon problems are weak client connectivity due to signal attenuation, interference from
external devices, and misbehaving or misconﬁgured client nodes [1]. These problems
have largely been responsible for WMN vendors not achieving sustainable client market
penetration, thereby leading to dwindling business prospects for this technology.
We believe that the effective diagnosis and troubleshooting of performance prob-
lems is key to the success of metro-scale WMNs. Although many novel metrics and
techniques to diagnose and troubleshoot problems in WMNs have been proposed by

the research community [9,6], sifting through a sea of such metrics collected from each
device in a metro-scale WMN can be overwhelming for network operators.
As a solution, diagnostic tools utilize visualization techniques such as time-series
plots and planar graphs4. However, the diagnosis of problems by viewing a myriad of
such graphs and plots in large-scale WMNs can be very tedious and time-consuming.
We believe that operators of large-scale WMNs need clever structured visualization
techniques to quickly navigate through metrics and diagnose problems. Numerous pub-
lications have shown that good visualizations decrease the time and effort to evaluate
large volumes of information in the Internet [11,10,8]5. To our knowledge, diagnostic
visualizations of large-scale WMNs have received little to no research attention yet. In
this paper we argue that these networks can certainly beneﬁt from visualization tools,
especially due to their increasing sizes and complexities.
To this end, we propose a focus and context visualization framework named SCUBA6.
SCUBA places performance metrics into several tiers or contexts. The topmost con-
text provides a WMN operator with a broad contextual overview of WMN perfor-
mance. By viewing only this broad context, WMN operators can quickly identify and
locate problems within the WMN. Once a problem location is determined, an opera-
tor can choose to narrow his/her focus on the problem region and zoom to reveal de-
tailed metric contexts within that region. In other words, the operator exposes a larger
set of metrics within a small focal region to diagnose the cause of a performance
problem.
In this paper we propose a scheme for organizing metrics into three contexts (route,
link, and client) with increasing detail. The placement of metrics is based on our ex-
perience of diagnosing WMN problems [5]. However, the main objective of SCUBA
is to facilitate focus and context visualization for any scheme. Different schemes de-
rived from WMN operators’ common diagnostic approaches will be explored in
the future to deﬁne better contexts as well as better placement of metrics within
contexts.
To explain contexts, metrics, and views of SCUBA, we utilize the Google Mountain
View WMN map of about 500 routers and gateways7. To understand SCUBA’s ease
of use in diagnosing a sample performance problem and it deployment challenges, we
implement it on the 15-node UCSB MeshNet [5].
2 SCUBA: Focus and Context Visualizations
The main objective of SCUBA is to facilitate fast and easy diagnosis of WMN perfor-
mance problems by cleverly organizing the performance metrics for focus and context
visualizations. In this section we discuss the metrics collection architecture, the organi-
zation of metrics into contexts, the different views SCUBA offers to the operator, and
the variety of visualization features implemented in SCUBA.

2.1 Metrics Collection Architecture
The performance metrics visualized by SCUBA are collected and computed from the
routers and gateways in a WMN. As shown in Figure 1(a), each router sends a set of
metrics to the SCUBA server via the gateway. The SCUBA server stores these metrics in
two locations: a database so that temporal trends of metrics can be observed, and a data
structure within main memory for fast access by SCUBA’s visualization engine. The
SCUBA visualization engine is a standalone Java application written using the Swing
GUI toolkit. We discuss the computation and collection of metrics speciﬁcally within
the UCSB MeshNet in Section 3.
2.2 SCUBA’s Contexts
One of the main obstacles to diagnosing problems in WMNs today is their sheer scale
and the abundance of performance metrics that can be overwhelming to the WMN op-
erator and unrealistic to analyze within a short period of time. To better organize the
collected information, we propose that WMN performance metrics be placed into sev-
eral contexts, where each context consists of one or more metrics.
The topmost context provides the WMN operator with a holistic view, a broad con-
textual overview of WMN health. In other words, a WMN operator can quickly identify
both the occurrence and the location of a problem in the WMN from such a broad con-
text. An operator can then use SCUBA to focus on speciﬁc problem areas. Once the
operator shifts focus, he/she can interactively zoom to view more detailed contexts.
In other words, the operator can choose to reveal more metrics and therefore increase
information detail isolated within the focal area.
For the scope of this paper, we place WMN metrics within three contexts; the route,
link, and client contexts. These three contexts and their metrics are summarized in Fig-
ure 1(b). The ﬁgure shows that as information detail increases, the focal region is nar-
rowed in the lower SCUBA contexts. We next describe the organization of metrics in
the three contexts and explain how these metrics help isolate causes of a sample WMN
performance problem.
Route Context: The route context is the topmost context and only displays multi-hop
routes between each router and its corresponding Internet gateway. The context consists
SCUBA: Focus and Context for Real-Time Mesh Network Health Diagnosis
165
of two metrics: (a) throughput of TCP ﬂows over the multi-hop routes formed from
each router; and (b) the round-trip time (RTT) of UDP packets on the same routes. The
two metrics are computed by each router and determine the quality of the route between
the router and its gateway. We include these metrics in the topmost context of SCUBA
because any signiﬁcant drop in their values indicates a serious performance problem.
WMN operators can use this problem indication and then zoom into the problem re-
gion to understand the real cause of a problem. For instance, problems such as sudden
route ﬂaps, unexpected drop in throughput, or an increase in RTT values can cause a
performance deterioration of TCP or UDP application ﬂows that utilize those routes.
Operators can further investigate the cause of such problems by increasing the context
in the problem areas.
Link Context: The link context reveals one additional metric, the expected transmis-
sions count (ETX) [3] on a link between the nodes. In the link context, SCUBA dis-
plays the point-to-point MAC-layer links between nodes in addition to the routes from
the route context. We use ETX as a metric in this context because it provides a good
estimate of the health of links between nodes. The quality of links is likely to impact
the routes that utilize them. As a result, if sudden route ﬂaps or a signiﬁcant drop in
throughput are observed at the route context, the most likely cause is poor quality links
utilized by the routes. Poor link quality is identiﬁed by an increase in the ETX value at
the link context, and typically occurs due to three reasons: (a) heavy volume of trafﬁc
ﬂowing over the link and/or neighboring links within its interference region; (b) exter-
nal interference from a co-located radio wave source that does not belong to the WMN;
and (c) heavy signal attenuation caused by some obstacle. Isolation of the causes of
poor links is achieved by zooming to the next lower context.
Client Context: The client context provides further insight into the cause of poor quality
links. SCUBA includes four metrics within this context: (a) the number of clients asso-
ciated with each router; (b) the percentage channel utilization per client [4]; (c) the re-
ceived signal strength indicator (RSSI) of MAC-layer frames received from clients; and
(d) the volume of external interference. These metrics are included within this context
because they each describe client connections and trafﬁc within a WMN. In the client
context, SCUBA displays the clients associated with the routers, along with the links
and the routes from the link context. A WMN operator will likely zoom to the client
context only when the cause of problems cannot be easily determined at the link context.
For instance, the cause of poor link quality can be isolated to either a large number of
clients with high channel utilization values or external interference8. Both these causes
can be determined from metrics in the client context. If neither have adversely impacted
the quality of links, the WMN operator can determine that heavy signal attenuation by
an obstacle is the likely cause of poor quality links, by the process of elimination.
2.3 Diagnostic Approaches and the Design of SCUBA
The three contexts and the placement of metrics within the contexts we present for
the current version of SCUBA have been designed based on our own experience of

building and deploying a WMN [5], and diagnosing problems using a logical top-to-
bottom approach. In the future, we plan to evaluate additional contexts such as traf-
ﬁc and application, for increased diagnosis ﬂexibility in speciﬁc application settings.
While our scheme is sufﬁciently general for diagnosing a wide variety of problems [1],
it does not represent an all-inclusive set of metrics or the only scheme of context or-
ganization. WMN operators may follow alternative diagnostic approaches in differ-
ent deployment scenarios, and the metrics they may ﬁnd useful in each scenario can
also vary. SCUBA, as a visualization framework, can be modiﬁed to utilize different
schemes based on the diagnostic approaches preferred by operators. The effectiveness
of SCUBA should then be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in speciﬁc scenar-
ios, using metrics such as its ease of use, how quickly it can help diagnose a problem,
and how many problems of interest it helps diagnose. Exploring other diagnostic ap-
proaches and evaluating their effectiveness, while outside of the scope of this paper, is
part of our usability-oriented ongoing work.
2.4 SCUBA Visualization Features
In this section we discuss the visualization features we use to communicate WMN
health using the seven metrics discussed in the previous section. We use different color
and size schemes for these features with a single consistent visualization policy across
all contexts and metrics, which is to highlight problems in the WMN, resulting in fast
and easy diagnosis of WMN problems. SCUBA’s visualizations are interactive, allow-
ing for continuous pan and zoom and tool-tip-style data readouts on mouse-over and
selection. The visualization features, as illustrated in Figure 2, are as follows:
