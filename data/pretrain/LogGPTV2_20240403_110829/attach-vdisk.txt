### Attach VDisk

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `attach vdisk` command mounts a virtual hard disk (VHD) so that it appears on the host computer as a local hard disk drive. If the VHD already has a disk partition and file system volume, the volume inside the VHD will be assigned a drive letter.

**Important:**
- You must select and detach a VHD for this operation to succeed.
- Use the `select vdisk` command to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
attach vdisk [readonly] { [sd=] | [usefilesd] } [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **readonly**
  - Attaches the VHD as read-only. Any write operation will return an error.

- **sd=**
  - Sets the user filter on the VHD. The filter string must be in the Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) format.
  - By default, the user filter allows access similar to a physical disk.
  - SDDL strings can be complex, but in their simplest form, a security descriptor that protects access is known as a discretionary access control list (DACL). It uses the form: `D:...`
  - Common DACL flags:
    - `A`: Allow access
    - `D`: Deny access
  - Common rights:
    - `GA`: All access
    - `GR`: Read access
    - `GW`: Write access
  - Common user accounts:
    - `BA`: Built-in administrators
    - `AU`: Authenticated users
    - `CO`: Creator owner
    - `WD`: Everyone
  - Examples:
    - `D:P:(A;;GR;;;AU)`: Gives read-access to all authenticated users.
    - `D:P:(A;;GA;;;WD)`: Gives everyone full access.

- **usefilesd**
  - Specifies that the security descriptor on the .vhd file should be used on the VHD.
  - If the `usefilesd` parameter is not specified, the VHD will not have an explicit security descriptor unless it is specified with the `sd` parameter.

- **noerr**
  - Used for scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
  - Without this parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**

- To attach the selected VHD as read-only, type:
  ```plaintext
  attach vdisk readonly
  ```

- To attach the selected VHD with a specific security descriptor, type:
  ```plaintext
  attach vdisk sd=D:P:(A;;GR;;;AU)
  ```

- To attach the selected VHD using the security descriptor from the .vhd file, type:
  ```plaintext
  attach vdisk usefilesd
  ```

- To attach the selected VHD and continue processing even if an error occurs, type:
  ```plaintext
  attach vdisk noerr
  ```
