matplotlib v2.0.0rc1, Python 3.5, OSX
upgraded via conda over standard anaconda installation
`%matplotlib notebook`
fails with an error message:
`Incompatible library version: _png.cpython-35m-darwin.so requires version
43.0.0 or later, but libpng16.16.dylib provides version 39.0.0`
Resolved via: `conda upgrade libpng`
Stackoverflow suggests its an occasional issue - the last answer here links it
to anaconda
May or may not be a matplotlib installer concern
