You're welcome and everything, but where's the flag??
Well, there aren't too many places where the flag can hide. After running the script a few times, we note that:
 * The source boards and messages are always the same
 * The destination boards (and therefore solutions) change between runs
 * Some boards are symmetric, so clearly there's more than one way to solve some boards
This means that the flag is probably hiding in the constant parts of the challenge: The source boards or the messages. The source boards have consecutive repetitions so we'll concentrate on the messages.
Looking closely, we can see that the first message starts with "C", the second with "S" and the third with "A". If we continue collecting the first characters, we get: `CSA{In_Th3OrY_wE_tRuST`. The accepted flag was `CSA{In_Th3OrY_wE_tRuST}`.
