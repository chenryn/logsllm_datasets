Numpy amax method raises warning when input is an array that contains NaN. I
do not recall that numpy did this in previous versions. Also, from the
documentation, it says that amax shall propagate NaN, so I would expect it to
return NaN without raising a warning.
### Reproducing code example:
    import numpy as np
    b = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
    b[2] = np.NaN
    np.amax(b)
NaN is returned, as expected, but a RuntimeWarning is issued, which I did not
expect.
### Error message:
C:\Python\WinPython\WPy-3710\python-3.7.1.amd64\lib\site-
packages\numpy\core_methods.py:26: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered
in reduce return umr_maximum(a, axis, None, out, keepdims)
