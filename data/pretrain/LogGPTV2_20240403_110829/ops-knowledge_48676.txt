Question: "Consider a web application that processes user-generated content before displaying it on a public forum. As a developer, you are reviewing code that is intended to sanitize input strings to prevent line delimiter injection vulnerabilities. Which of these approaches would be the most secure way to handle the input strings?"
 "A": "Use a denylist to filter out known dangerous characters or patterns and directly output the sanitized input."
 "B": "Perform input validation by allowing only a strict set of known good inputs, rejecting all others, and then encoding the output."
 "C": "Canonicalize inputs to a standard internal representation, perform input validation, and ensure inputs are not decoded multiple times."
 "D": "Accept all user input and rely on the downstream component to perform necessary validation and sanitation."
