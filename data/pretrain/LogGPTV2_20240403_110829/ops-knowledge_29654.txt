User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 os_resource_contention 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks for a potential issue where other processes outside the database may be occupying too many handle resources. If the system file descriptor (fds) occupation rate exceeds the detection threshold, it is considered a root cause and the function returns a boolean value of True. The system fds occupation rate is recorded in the diagnosis report along with a suggestion to determine whether the handle resource is occupied by the database or other processes. If the system fds occupation rate is below the tuple_number_threshold, it is not a root cause and the function returns a boolean value of False.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- process_fds_rate
- handler_occupation_threshold
