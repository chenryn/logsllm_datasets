I have a webpack configs for two builds with `watch: true` options.  
If I try `module.exports = {/*1st build*/}` or `module.exports = {/*2st
build*/}` everything is fine.  
But when I try to combine them into one like this:  
`module.exports = [{/*1st build*/},{/*2d build*/}]`  
and run `webpack` command it doesn't watch for changes. It just stops working
like there is no `watch: true` option there.  
But if I run `webpack --watch` it works and watches for changes.
Shouldn't those `watch: true` options work from inside the config? Or is
`webpack --watch` the only way to do it?
