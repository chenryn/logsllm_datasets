This may exist so apologies if I couldn't find it and am duplicating here:
Would it be possible to break out the code for a client only API that doesn't
include the entire elastic search code base?
Currently we have a lot of modular web services modules that make calls to
elastic search and because we want to include the advantages of the transport
client we have to use the full elastic search codebase. This means that each
web service war file is +30 megabytes.
Ideally we'd like a client jar file that only includes the API and the
transport code.
