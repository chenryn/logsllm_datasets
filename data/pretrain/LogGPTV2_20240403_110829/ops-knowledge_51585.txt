User: I have a python script which basically lauches an Xmlrpc server. I need this script to run always. I have a function that may call for the system to reboot itself. So once the system has rebooted, I need to get the script running again. 
How can I add this to the Windows RT startup?
Assistant: There is no way for a Windows Store app to trigger a system reboot, neither can it run a Python script unless you implement a Python interperter inside your app. Windows Store apps run in their own sandbox and have very limited means of communication with the rest of the system.
