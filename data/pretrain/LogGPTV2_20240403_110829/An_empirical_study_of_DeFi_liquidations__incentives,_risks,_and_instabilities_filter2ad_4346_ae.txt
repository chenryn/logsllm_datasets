If the liquidator instead chooses to perform the up-to-close-factor
strategy, the repay amount is CF·𝐷 and the profit hence is 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑐 =
LS·CF·𝐷. Therefore, the optimal strategy can yield more profit than
the up-to-close-factor strategy. The increase rate of the liquidation
profit is shown in Equation 9.

5.2.2 Case Study. In the following, we study the most profitable
fixed spread liquidation transaction (4.04M USD)7 we detect and
showcase how the optimal fixed spread liquidation strategy in-
creases the profit of a liquidator. In this Compound liquidation, the
liquidator first performs an oracle price update8, which renders a

signed by, for example, off-chain price sources.

borrowing position liquidatable. The liquidator then liquidates the
position within the same transaction. In Table 5, we present the
status change of the position following the price update. Before the
price update (block 11333036), the position owns a total collateral
of 135.07M USD (with a borrowing capacity of 101.30M USD), and
owes a debt of 101.18M USD. After the price of DAI increases from
1.08 to 1.095299 USD/DAI, the total debt reaches 102.61M USD,
while the borrowing capacity is only 102.55M USD. The health
factor drops below 1, and hence the position becomes liquidatable.
To evaluate the up-to-close-factor strategy and our optimal liq-
uidation strategy, we implement the original liquidation and the
two liquidation strategies9 in Solidity v0.8.410. We execute them
on the corresponding blockchain states11 and present the results
in Table 6. We find that the optimal strategy is superior to the up-
to-close-factor strategy and can generate an additional profit of
49.26K DAI (53.96K USD) compared to the original liquidation.

11We fork the Ethereum mainchain locally from block 11333036 and apply all the
transactions executed prior to the original liquidation transaction in block 11333037.
We then execute the liquidation strategies to ensure that they are validated on the
exact same state of the original liquidation.

5.2.3 Mitigation. The aforementioned optimal strategy defeats
the original intention of a close factor, which incurs undesirably
additional losses to borrowers. A possible mitigation solution is
that for every position only one liquidation is permitted within one
block. Such a setting enforces a liquidator adopting the optimal
strategy to settle the two liquidations in two blocks, which decreases
the success probability.
We proceed to assume the existence of a mining liquidator with
a mining power 𝛼. Given a liquidation opportunity, the up-to-close-
factor strategy produces a profit of 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑐, while the optimal strat-
egy yields 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑜1 and 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑜2 respectively in the two successive
liquidations. We further assume that there is no ongoing consensus
layer attack (e.g., double-spending), implying that a miner with an
𝛼 fraction mining power mines the next block is with a probability
of 𝛼. We hence derive the the expected profit of the two strategies
as shown in Equation 10 and 1112.
E[up-to-close-factor] = 𝛼 · 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑐
(10)
(11)
The liquidator is incentivized to perform the optimal strategy only
when E[optimal] > E[up-to-close-factor], leading to Equation 12.
E[optimal] = 𝛼 · 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑜1 + 𝛼2 · 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑜2
𝛼 >
(12)
𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑜1
𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑜2
Intuitively, 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑜1 is relatively small compared to 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑐 and
𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑜2 because the liquidator needs to keep the position un-
healthy after the first liquidation. The expected profit in the second
liquidation then should be sufficient to cover the opportunity cost
in the first one, which is typically unattainable. Instantiating with
our case study liquidation (cf. Table 5), we show that a rational
mining liquidator would attempt the optimal strategy in two con-
secutive blocks only if its mining power is over 99.68%. Therefore,
we conclude that the one liquidation in one block effectively reduces
the expected profit of the optimal liquidation strategy, protecting
borrowers from a further liquidation losses.
12To ease understanding, we assume other competing liquidators adopt the up-to-
close-factor strategy.

6 RELATED WORK
Blockchains and DeFi: There is a growing body of literature on
blockchains and DeFi. Qin et al. [30] study flash loan attacks and
present an optimization approach to maximize the profit of DeFi
attacks. Zhou et al. [39] analyze sandwich attacks in decentral-
ized exchanges. Eskandari et al. [18] provide an overview of the
blockchain front-running attacks. Daian et al. [13] investigate the
front-running attacks in decentralized exchanges and propose the
concept of Miner Extractable Value (MEV), a financial revenue min-
ers can extract through transaction order manipulation. Qin et
al. [29] quantify the extracted MEV on the Ethereum blockchain,
including fixed spread liquidations, and present a generalized front-
running algorithm, transaction replay. Zhou et al. [38] propose a
framework called DeFiPoser that allows to automatically create
profit-generating transactions given the blockchain state.
Blockchain Borrowing and Lending Markets: Darlin et al. [15]
study the MakerDAO liquidation auctions. The authors optimize
the costs for participating in the auctions and find that most auc-
tions conclude at higher than optimal prices. The work appears
real-world relevant, as it considers the transaction fees, conver-
sion costs and cost of capital, yet it does not consider potential
gas bidding contests by the end of MakerDAO auctions [13]. Kao
et al. [23] and ZenGo [37] are to our knowledge the first to have
investigated Compound’s liquidation mechanism (the third biggest
lending protocol in terms of USD at the time of writing). Perez et
al. [27] follow up with a report that focuses on additional on-chain
analytics of the Compound protocol. DragonFly Research provides
a blog post [16] about the liquidator profits on Compound, dYdX
and MakerDAO. Minimizing financial deposit amounts in cryptoe-
conomic protocols, while maintaining the same level of security is
studied in Balance [21].
Liquidations in Traditional Finance: Liquidations are essential
to traditional finance (TradFi) and are well studied in the related
literature [5, 7, 31, 32, 34]. We remark that liquidations in blockchain
systems are fundamentally different from those in TradFi in terms
of high-level designs and settlement mechanisms.
7 CONCLUSION
Due to their significant volatility when compared to alternative
financial vehicles cryptocurrencies are attracting speculators. Fur-
thermore, because speculators seek to further their risk exposure,
non-custodial lending and borrowing protocols on blockchains are
thriving. The risks of borrowing, however, manifests themselves in
the form of liquidation profits claimed by liquidators.
In this paper we study the lending platforms that capture 85%
of the blockchain lending market. We systematize the most preva-
lent liquidation mechanisms and find that many liquidations sell
excessive amounts of borrower’s collateral. In this work we pro-
vide extensive data analytics covering over 2 years the prevalent 4
lending protocols. We systematize their respective liquidation mech-
anisms and show that most liquidation systems are unfavorable
to the borrowers. We finally show an optimal liquidation strategy
which we have not yet observed in the wild.
