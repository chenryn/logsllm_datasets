 **Describe the bug**
When calling `clock.getDelta()` _after_ `clock.getElapsedTime()`, the returned
value is not the delta between successive calls to `clock.getDelta()`.
_**Live example**_
https://codesandbox.io/s/three-frame-delta-ev4d9
**Expected behavior**
Sometimes I want to animate certain objects based on the elapsed time and
others based on time deltas. I expect to be able to call `clock.getDelta()`
once per frame and have the result represent the time between frames. However,
given the implementation of `clock.getElapsedTime()`, this is not the case if
you are also calling `clock.getElapsedTime` in the same loop.
If you read closely, the docs do correctly describe this behavior ("Get the
seconds passed since the time oldTime was set"), but IMO it is not the
expected behavior.
Or perhaps this is more of an enhancement request: could there be a separate
function like `clock.getFrameDelta()` that is independent of
`clock.getElapsedTime()`? Or is the suggested workaround to use multiple
clocks here?
**Platform:**
  * Three.js version: r128
