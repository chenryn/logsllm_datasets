### Analysis and Discussion

Using an 18 kHz carrier frequency, we can achieve good transmission accuracy while the audio remains nearly unnoticeable. If the distance is too far to maintain acceptable accuracy, the carrier frequency can be adjusted to 15 kHz. With a 15 kHz carrier, close to 100% accuracy can be achieved, although it does leak some noticeable frequencies. In our tests, faint sounds were only heard when the ear was right next to the computer speaker. No noticeable sounds were heard a few feet away from the computer. This is consistent with previous research indicating that frequencies above 15 kHz can only be heard at high volumes [36].

### Impact of Noise

As expected, the introduction of noise near the voice assistant (VA) negatively impacts data transmission. As shown in Figure 8(e), the presence of night ambient noise significantly reduces transmission accuracy when using 18 or 20 kHz carrier frequencies. In contrast, the impact is minimal for a 15 kHz carrier, even when the distance between the computer and the VA is several feet.

### Error Correction

We performed data decoding both with and without error correction. When the tone length is fixed at 50 ms and no noise is added, varying the distance from 0 inches to 100 inches, the results are shown in Figure 8(b). At 0 inches, there are no errors in the decoded characters. However, at 25 inches, errors due to bit flips occur. These errors can be corrected using error correction. We also varied the tone length from 12 ms to 50 ms, with no added noise, and fixed the distance at 0 inches. As shown in Figure 8(c), a tone length of 12 ms results in many bit flips leading to errors, both with and without error correction. A tone length of 16 ms shows about 50% fewer errors with error correction. There are no errors when the tone length is 50 ms, and accuracy is nearly 100% in both cases. Since errors do occur at certain distances and tone lengths, we use error correction despite the fact that it halves the transfer rate.

### Summary

Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of data exfiltration via a VA even when it is several feet away from a compromised computer. This can be done even when humans are close to the computer or VA because most people cannot hear frequencies higher than 15 kHz. Using error correction, 9000 bits can be transmitted in a five-minute phone call to a remote endpoint with very high accuracy. This can be achieved with an 18 kHz carrier, making the audio completely unnoticeable, and a distance of over six feet. Although a bit rate of 30 bits/s is sufficient for transmitting passwords, account numbers, and other limited sensitive information with few errors even at 100 inches, the bit rate can be increased to 75 bits/s by reducing the tone length to 20 ms, as shown in Figure 8(a). As expected, noise and distance both reduce the accuracy of transmission.

### VII. DISCUSSION

#### A. Feasibility of Stealthy Attacks

We use carrier frequencies between 15 kHz and 20 kHz based on existing research on human hearing. It is known that humans cannot hear sounds above 20 kHz, but this range decreases with age [8]. Experiments show that frequencies above 15 kHz mixed with other sounds are not noticeable by listeners [27]. For an adult, to achieve minimum audibility of a 18 kHz sound in close vicinity, a volume greater than 80 dB is required, which is typically the noise level of a gas-powered lawnmower [11]. Normal computer speakers cannot produce such high levels of sound. Therefore, the audio generated and played on the victim's computer is unlikely to be heard by adults. Our experiments show that a 15 kHz carrier can deliver messages with a range close to 100 inches. When higher stealthiness is required, an 18 kHz carrier can be used with somewhat lower accuracy. Thus, with high carrier frequencies, it is feasible to launch attacks while ensuring inaudibility for most adults in close vicinity.

#### B. Defenses

Phone calls are typically made by users, whereas data exfiltration via a VA requires the audio to originate from a computer speaker. Liveness detection techniques have been developed for commands to VAs. For example, it has been demonstrated that certain characteristic frequencies are present in audio that comes from a speaker, which are not present when the audio source is a live person [4]. These frequencies are low (< 200 Hz) and will not be transmitted by the telephony channel. Hence, defenses based on such frequency detection must be deployed at the VA. However, there may be legitimate cases where a call source is a computer, such as a conferencing application running on a computer that commands a VA to reach certain participants with a phone call. Future AI-based applications running on a computer may also use VAs in conversations with remote parties reached via the phone (e.g., Google Duplex [14]). In such cases, liveness detection defense cannot always be used. Another possibility is to use voice biometrics such as speaker verification. However, our experiments found that to avoid false negatives in the presence of noise, VAs are permissive and could be targeted at scale using techniques like master voice prints [23].

Defenses against malware or compromised applications that abuse computer speakers can also be deployed on the computer where sensitive data is stored. These include access control for speakers and monitoring of audio streams going to the speakers. For example, an audio stream consisting of DTMF tones only could raise an alarm. However, this could be evaded by using frequencies other than DTMF. Since a VA must send the audio stream to the cloud, another possible defense is to examine the audio stream for possible anomalies. Various audio steganography techniques have been investigated in the literature and their use may evade such defenses.

#### C. Limitations

We demonstrated that an infected computer can command a VA to set up a phone call that can transmit sixty bits per second. Such a rate may not be sufficient for massive data transfer or large-scale data dumps. For example, a call lasting ten minutes can only exfiltrate approximately 2.5K bytes of data at this rate. Additionally, the audio may not be completely inaudible to all people when a carrier lower than 20 kHz is used. Young children, in particular, may be able to hear some sounds when they are very close to the computer or the VA, which may raise an alert. Achieving completely inaudible audio transmission for everyone for large volumes of data over the voiceband of a telephony call is a problem that has not been fully addressed by this paper. The channel between the targeted computer and the attacker is one-way, as it is not possible for the attacker to send inaudible commands through the phone channel and VA due to the frequency limit of 3400 Hz. Thus, the malware running on a victim's computer cannot receive feedback to adjust its transmission. Finally, we use the phone call feature of Amazon Echo. Although this feature is useful and likely to be provided by VAs, it is possible that in the future calls are only allowed to certain phone numbers (e.g., those in a contact list). In this case, an attacker would need to gain access to the voicemail of an allowed phone number or find a way to get a phone number controlled by it to the contact list. This is not addressed by us.

### VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

As voice assistants become common in the same physical areas as computers, they create a new channel for data exfiltration. Malware-infected computers can bypass normal network and host defenses by using the voice assistant and the phone channel to send sensitive data to an attacker-controlled computer. We demonstrated that a modest amount of data can be exfiltrated by encoding the data in audio and transmitting it via a voice assistant-initiated phone call that lasts only a few minutes. By using techniques such as modulation with very high-frequency carriers, it is possible to send the audio from the computer to the voice assistant in a way that is unlikely to be noticed by a person who may be in the vicinity of these devices. These attacks are concerning because they can be mounted from anywhere, at scale, and at low cost.

In the future, we plan to explore if the transmission of data such as text can be made more efficient when sent over the voiceband of a telephony channel. Malware may also be able to use computer speakers to discover if there is a VA near the computer and its distance, which can be used to improve attack efficacy. We briefly discussed several defenses that may be possible against data exfiltration via voice assistants, but their efficacy is unclear. Detection and defenses against malware that may use the audio channel between the computer and voice assistants also need to be investigated.
