Lemma 2.2 ([Lyu12]). Let V be a subset of Rn with elements of norm less than T, let h be a
distribution of V. b ∈ Rn. Consider a procedure that samples a y ← Dn
σ and then returns the
output of Rej(z := y + b, b, σ) where σ ≥ 11(cid:107)b(cid:107). The probability that this procedure outputs 1 is
within 2−100 of 1/3. The distribution of z, conditioned on the output being 1, is within statistical
distance 2−100 of Dn
σ .
2.4 M-SIS and M-LWE
In this section we introduce the hard problems on which our schemes rely. We will be using the
”Module” (or “Generalized”) variants of the LWE and SIS problems, introduced in [BGV12,LS15].
These are generalizations of the usual LWE and SIS problems in the sense that, while the former
are deﬁned over the ring Zq, the latter are instantiated over polynomial rings Rq. Since we will
instantiate our scheme with power-of-two cyclotomic ring we only deﬁne those problems for this
setting. M -SIS and M -LW E can be deﬁned for any ring but the deﬁnitions are more cumbersome
(see [LS15]). For simplicity we will consider the M -LW E problem in which the secret and the
randomness are sampled in S1 (i.e. uniformly from the set of elements bounded in inﬁnity norm)
this assumption is common in practical cryptographic schemes, e.g. [BDK+18,DKL+18,LN17].

as follows. Given A ∈ Rn×m

The parameters n, k ∈ Z must be set so that the commitment is hiding and binding. The
parameter l ∈ Z dictates the size of the message space. We remark that an opening of a commitment
does not simply consist of a message and a randomness but also includes a small polynomial c which
multiplies the commitment. The reason is that when doing zero-knowledge proofs for commitments
the knowledge extractor will not be able to extract an exact opening of t = Com(m; r) but only
an opening of ct where c will be the diﬀerence of two challenges. We prove that our commitment
is hiding and binding in Section 6.1.
2.6 Trapdoor sampling

We found experimentally that for our structured matrix R it is slightly larger but less than 3
Now a short preimage [ s1 s2 ]T of u + a2· s3 can be sampled by computing an arbitrary solution
[ x1 x2 ], expressing this solution in the basis S of the orthogonal lattice Λ⊥ and decoding using
the randomized nearest plane discrete Gaussian sampler from [GPV08]. This gives a solution that
is distributed as a discrete Gaussian with parameter s = 2 · (cid:107) ˜S(cid:107) ≤ 2(3

3 Galois Group Structure of Cyclotomic Rings
In Section 4 we will want to construct a proof of knowledge of an opening µ ∈ Rq = R/qR to a
commitment with the additional guarantee that µ lies in a certain subset of Rq. For our purposes
of group signatures we need µ to be invertible and therefore want the subset to be a subﬁeld. We
do this by proving that µ is ﬁxed by certain automorphisms that we construct from the Galois
automorphisms of our cyclotomic ﬁeld K. This then shows that µ is contained in Sq = S/qS where
S ⊂ R is the ring of integers of a subﬁeld of K. Here we can arrange for the prime number q to
stay inert in S so that Sq is a ﬁeld.
3.1 Generic Cyclotomic Rings
We have the following setup. K = Q[X]/(Φm(X)) is the m-th cyclotomic number ﬁeld of degree
d = ϕ(m) with ring of integers R = Z[X]/(Φm(X)). Let L ⊂ K be a subﬁeld of K, not necessarily
cyclotomic, with ring of integers S ⊂ R. We thus have the following diagram of rings and ﬁelds.

K

Q
Finally suppose q is a prime number that is inert in L, i.e. such that Sq = S/qS ⊂ Rq is a ﬁeld,
and unramiﬁed in K.
The automorphisms of K form a group under composition called the Galois group of K which
we denote by G = Gal(K/Q). It is easy to see that all automorphisms ﬁx the rational numbers
Q, σ(x) = x for all σ ∈ G and x ∈ Q. Conversely, cyclotomic ﬁelds are special among general
number ﬁelds in that they are Galois over Q meaning that only the elements of Q are ﬁxed by all
automorphisms. The Galois group of cyclotomic ﬁelds is isomorphic to Z×
m where the isomorphism
j (cid:55)→ σj : Z×
m → Gal(K/Q)
is deﬁned by σj(X) = X j and Q-linear extension. In general the degree of a Galois extension of
ﬁelds is always equal to the order of the Galois group. The main theorem of Galois theory says
that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of G and the subﬁelds of K. For
example the subgroup H  2.
