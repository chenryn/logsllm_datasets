User: I have a python script which I have made dropable using a registry-key, but it does not seem to work. The cmd.exe window just flashes by, can I somehow make the window stay up, or save the output?
EDIT: the problem was that it gave the whole path not only the filename.
Assistant: Another possible option is to create a basic TKinter GUI with a textarea and a close button. Then run that with subprocess or equiv. and have that take the stdout from your python script executed with pythonw.exe so that no CMD prompt appears to start with.
This keeps it purely using Python stdlib's and also means you could use the GUI for setting options or entering parameters...
Just an idea.
