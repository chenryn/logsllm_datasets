ABSTRACT
The Short Messaging Service (SMS), one of the most suc-
cessful cellular services, generates millions of dollars in rev-
enue for mobile operators. Estimates indicate that billions
of text messages are traveling the airwaves daily. Never-
theless, text messaging is becoming a source of customer
dissatisfaction due to the rapid surge of messaging abuse
activities. Although spam is a well tackled problem in the
email world, SMS spam experiences a yearly growth larger
than 500%.
In this paper we present, to the best of our
knowledge, the ﬁrst analysis of SMS spam traﬃc from a
tier-1 cellular operator. Communication patterns of spam-
mers are compared to those of legitimate cell-phone users
and Machine to Machine (M2M) connected appliances. The
results indicate that M2M systems exhibit communication
proﬁles similar to spammers, which could mislead spam ﬁl-
ters. Beyond the expected results, such as a large load of
text messages sent out to a wide target list, other interest-
ing ﬁndings are made. For example, the results indicate that
the great majority of the spammers connect to the network
with just a handful of diﬀerent hardware models. We ﬁnd
the main geographical sources of messaging abuse in the US.
We also ﬁnd evidence of spammer mobility, voice and data
traﬃc resembling the behavior of legitimate customers.

INTRODUCTION
For the past three decades, the Short Messaging Service
(SMS) has gained tremendous popularity throughout the
world. Reports estimate billions of text messages handled
daily by cellular providers’ messaging infrastructures [19],
generating millions of dollars of yearly revenue [7].
Being unquestionably successful,
text messaging is
steadily becoming an annoyance due to the surge of SMS
fraudulent activities [16]. Spam is the commonly adopted
name to refer to unwanted messages that are massively sent
to a large number of recipients.
Spam is a well known and tackled problem in the con-
text of e-mail. Multiple solutions detect and block spam
e-mails daily resulting in a small amount of spam reaching
customer’s inboxes. This is considered a great achievement
given the estimates indicating that 90% of the daily elec-
tronic mail traversing the Internet is spam [3].
In the case of text messaging abuse, the trend has been
rapidly increasing with the introduction of unlimited mes-
saging plans. Current studies estimate mobile SMS spam to
be experiencing a steady yearly growth larger than 500% [8].
Eﬀective anti-abuse messaging ﬁlters are deployed, sparing
networks from spam text messages injected into cellular net-
works from the Internet. However, content-based algorithms
used to detect e-mail spam, are less eﬃcient in the case of
SMS spam [11]. The length of an SMS is limited to only 160
characters [23] and customers often use acronyms, pruned
spellings and emoticons which mislead detection algorithms.
Thus, mobile originated SMS spam still remains a problem
for cellular networks.
The criminals - spammers - connect aircards and cell-
phones to personal computers (PCs). These are used to
send thousands of daily spam text messages, mostly using
pre-paid SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards with un-
limited messaging plans. The defense against such illegiti-
mate activities often involves SIM shutdowns and account
cancelations. This does not stop most spammers, though,
who purchase multiple cards and swap them to limit the
daily per-SIM volume [8].
Millions of illegitimate text messages are transmitted via
cellular networks daily [16]. These messages consume net-
work resources that could be allocated to legitimate ser-
vices otherwise. SMS spam results also in a major inconve-
nience for cellular customers because, without an unlimited
plan, the end user is paying at a per received message basis.
Therefore, SMS spam potentially generates unwanted bill
charges for some users leading to negative messaging experi-
ence and customer dissatisfaction. Spam also exposes smart-

phone users to viruses. Often multiple fraudulent messaging
activities such as phishing, identity theft and fraud [25] are
related to SMS spam. SMS is also known as an entry vector
for malware propagation [15].
In this paper we analyze the characteristics and commu-
nication patterns of SMS spammers. The analysis is based
on mining SMS, Voice and IP network traﬃc from a tier-1
network operator in the United States. The behavior of over
9000 positively identiﬁed and known spammers is analyzed
and compared to legitimate cell-phone users and embedded
Machine to Machine (M2M) appliances. As will be shown
throughout the paper, some M2M communication systems
exhibit a behavior that resembles in some aspects that of an
SMS spammer. The results of this investigation are being
used to develop an advanced SMS spam detection engine,
the details of which are out of the scope of this paper.
Beyond the expected results, such as the large load of
messages sent by spammers to a widely geographically dis-
tributed target list, very interesting discoveries are presented
in this paper. For example, the vast majority of spammers
utilize just ﬁve diﬀerent models of hardware to send the mes-
sages. Some of these devices are very popular feature phones
that are reﬂashed to be used as cellular modem. In terms of
traﬃc, spammers make a large number of phone calls, of very
short duration, perhaps to mislead detection schemes that
might discard accounts with a near-human voice communi-
cation proﬁle. We also ﬁnd the main geographical hot-spots
(sources) of messaging abuse activities in the US and that
some spammers launch very geographically targeted cam-
paigns.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to
(a) analyze characteristics of fraudulent SMS spam traﬃc
over a major cellular network
(b) analyze voice and IP communication patterns and device
and location characteristics of accounts cancelled due to
fraudulent SMS activities
(c) compare communication patterns of spammers, legiti-
mate cell-phone users and M2M systems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes the three data sets under analysis (SMS spam-
mers, legitimate users and M2M systems) and how they are
labeled. Section 3 presents the data analysis. In Section
4 we give some introductory comments on an SMS spam
detection engine that has been designed based on the data
analysis in this paper. Section 5 discusses the related work.
Finally, the study is concluded with the closing remarks in
Section 6.

2. EVIDENCE OF THE CRIME: DATA SET
The analysis presented in this paper is based on traﬃc
data provided by a tier-1 cellular operator in the United
States. The data sample contains Call Detail Records
(CDR) of 9000 spammer accounts and almost 17000 legiti-
mate accounts. This last set includes about 7000 Machine
to Machine devices and 10000 post-paid family plans, from
the one year period between March 2011 and February 2012.
CDRs are records logging each phone call, text message
and data exchange in the network. If two communicating
ends belong to the same provider, a duple of records is
stored. The Mobile Originated (MO) record logs data of the
transmitting party, while the Mobile Terminated (MT) one
stores information of the receiver. Note that the MO and
the MT records for the same transaction contain duplicated
data, such as the originating number and the terminating
number. IP (Internet Protocol) data traﬃc generates only
MO logs.
Table 1 summarizes the CDR ﬁelds used in our analysis.
The originating and terminating phone numbers are fully
anonymized and only the ﬁrst 8 digits of the International
Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) are parsed, discarding
individual serial numbers. This ﬁrst portion of the device
identiﬁer, known as the Type Allocation Code (TAC), de-
termines the manufacturer and model of the wireless device.
In the case of a phone, the TAC indicates the manufacturer
and model of the phone itself (e.g. Nokia Lumia 900) and,
in the case of an M2M connected device, the TAC identiﬁes
the embedded cellular modem (e.g. Sierra Wireless Q2687).
The spammer data set is obtained as follows. A list of pos-
itively identiﬁed spamming accounts and their cancelation
dates were provided by the Fraud Department of the cellu-
lar operator. The Fraud Department maintains a constantly
updated white-list of known legitimate sources of large loads
of text messages (i.e. Twitter, American Idol alerts, etc) so
they are never confused with spam. Therefore, this data set
contains exclusively spammer accounts that were identiﬁed
and disconnected from the network.
The legitimate account data set is obtained in two steps.
First legitimate user accounts are selected and then legit-
imate M2M appliances are catalogued and included to the
set. Our analysis of spammer accounts revealed that 99:64%

Figure 1: Messaging pattern of spammers (red), legitimate customers (green) and M2M (blue)
of spammers have prepaid plans. Therefore, the set of legiti-
mate customers is drawn from a random and geographically
uniform sample of post-paid family plan accounts, which are
highly unlikely to be used by a spammer. This way we min-
imize the probability of having an unknown spammer misla-
beled as legitimate. In parallel, M2M connected appliances
are identiﬁed by the TAC and extracted from the operator’s
list of M2M approved devices. This is a database of the
M2M devices that have been selected, tested and approved
to operate on the provider’s cellular network. These devices
include connected appliances running all kinds of services.
Some applications found in our data set are asset tracking,
remote medical monitoring, security monitoring, Automatic
Teller Machines and smart grid power meters. We discard,
though, approved M2M systems with a Universal Serial Bus
(USB) port because these could be used to send illegitimate
messages if plugged to a spammer’s computer.
Message abusing accounts stay alive for a short period of
time (see Section 3.1), therefore we collected CDR records
for spammer accounts for one week prior to cancelation. For
each legitimate account we collected data for a random week
between March 2011 and February 2012.
From the CDR data ﬁelds we extract multiple features
that characterize customer communication patterns. For
example, based on the time stamp of each MO SMS (and
MO call) we calculate the intervals between two consecutive
outgoing messages (and phone calls) and the number of out-
going messages (calls) per day. Based on the time stamps
of MT SMSs (MT calls) we calculate the average number
of MT messages (calls) per day. The response ratio is com-
puted combining the average number of MO and MT mes-
sages (calls) per day. The terminating number ﬁeld for SMS
and voice traﬃc, also anonymized, is used to calculate the
number of individual recipients and the number of diﬀerent
terminating area codes per day. From uplink and downlink
byte counts we compute aggregated data usage per week.
Finally, geo-location data is extracted from the CDR
records. The coordinates of the serving base station are
recorded each time an SMS is transmitted. MO records con-
tain the coordinates of the tower receiving the message in
the uplink, whereas the MT record lists the base station de-
livering the SMS in the downlink. Based on this data ﬁelds,
the location of a device can be estimated with an accuracy
equivalent to the size of a cell or sector. If two communi-
cating devices are connected to the same operator, we know
approximate locations of both the sender and the receiver.

INVESTIGATION
This section describes the analysis of conﬁrmed SMS
spammer accounts that were canceled due to messaging
abuse activities. The study compares communication pat-
443recipient into replying to the message (Figure 2). Despite
a small percentage of users will reply, the large amount of
accounts targeted in a spam campaign results in many re-
sponses.
Figure 1c, which plots the distribution of the number of
destinations, shows that legitimate accounts have a small set
of recipients. Cell-phone users text on average to 7 contacts
per day, while spammers hit a couple of thousand victims
each day.
The ratio of the number of recipients to the number of
messages, shown in Figure 1d, provides an additional in-
sight. On average, spammers send one message to each vic-
tim. Legitimate users send multiple messages to a small set
of destinations. For this speciﬁc feature, M2M appliances
display a mixed distribution. Some devices send many mes-
sages to a small set of destinations while others transmit one
single message to each destination. It is important to note
that such M2M systems could be miss-labeled as message
abusers by simple spam ﬁlters.
