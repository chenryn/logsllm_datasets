### Overview of Service Monitoring on Provider-Edge (PE) Routers

In a typical network setup, multiple services or logical interfaces share a single port on a provider-edge (PE) router. Each service is associated with one logical interface. For instance, a set of services (colored in yellow) may be destined for one customer-edge (CE) router, while another set (colored in red) may be destined for a different CE router.

To monitor each service, dedicated maintenance association end point (MEP) sessions are required. When a session goes down, the corresponding service can be brought down by disabling its logical interface. However, this approach is not scalable when dealing with a large number of services. Monitoring the CFM (Connectivity Fault Management) session on the physical interface is also impractical, as it could disrupt services to other CE routers.

To address the scalability issue and efficiently monitor multiple services with a single session, you can create a CCM (Continuity Check Message) action profile. This profile allows you to bring down a group of logical interfaces using a CFM session configured on a single logical interface.

### Topology Example

**Figure 3: Topology of Multiple VLAN Services Sharing a Single Port on PE Router Destined to Multiple CE Routers**

### CCM Action Profile Scenarios

You can configure CCM action profiles for the following scenarios:

1. **Bring Down a Group of Logical Interfaces with the Same Parent Port:**
   - When the CCM monitoring session is running on one of the logical interfaces but on a different parent port.
2. **Bring Down a Group of Logical Interfaces on the Same Parent Port:**
   - When the CCM monitoring session is running on one of the logical interfaces, all belonging to the same parent port.
3. **Bring Down the Port:**
   - When the CCM monitoring session is running on one of the logical interfaces of a different parent port.

### Benefits of Creating a CFM Action Profile

- **Reduces Resource Requirements:** In scaled networks, this approach minimizes the need for individual MEP sessions for each service, thereby reducing resource consumption.
- **Enhances Performance and Scalability:** By avoiding the need to create individual MEP sessions for each service, the network's performance and scalability are significantly improved.

### Configuration Steps

To monitor multiple services or IFLs using a CFM session configured on a single logical interface, follow these steps:

1. **Configure the Action Profile:**
   - At the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]` hierarchy level, specify the name of the action profile and the CFM events.
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
     user@host# set action-profile profile-name event [event1, event2, event3..]
     ```
   - Example:
     ```shell
     user@host# set action-profile AP_test event adjacency-loss rdi
     ```
   - Note: The `interface-group-down` action is only supported with `adjacency-loss` and `RDI` events. Configuring other events will result in a commit error.

2. **Define the Action to Bring Down the Interface Group:**
   - At the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name]` hierarchy level, define the action.
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile AP-test]
     user@host# set action interface-group-down
     ```
   - Note: The `interface-group-down` action is not supported with other interface-related actions. Configuring other actions will result in a commit error.

3. **Define the Maintenance Domain:**
   - At the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]` hierarchy level, define the maintenance domain and specify the maintenance-association parameters.
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
     user@host# set maintenance-domain domain-name level number maintenance-association ma-name continuity-check interval 1s
     ```
   - Example:
     ```shell
     user@host# set maintenance-domain md6 level 6 maintenance-association ma6 continuity-check interval 1s
     ```

4. **Define the Maintenance Association Endpoint:**
   - At the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-association ma-name]` hierarchy level, define the maintenance association endpoint and the associated parameters.
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-association ma-name]
     user@host# set mep mep-id interface interface-name direction down remote-mep mep-id
     ```
   - Example:
     ```shell
     user@host# set mep 101 interface ge-0/0/0.0 direction down remote-mep 102
     ```

5. **Configure the Interface Group at the Remote MEP Level:**
   - If the action profile has the `interface-group-down` action configured, it is mandatory to configure the interface group at the RMEP level.
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id remote-mep mep-id action-profile profile-name]
     user@host# set interface-group
     ```
   - Example:
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md6 maintenance-association ma6 mep 101 remote-mep 102 action-profile AP_test]
     user@host# set interface-group
     ```
   - Note: If the interface-group configuration is not included in the RMEP configuration, the configuration will result in a commit error.

6. **Configure the Device Interface Name and Unit List:**
   - A logical interface is represented by a combination of the interface-device-name and unit-list. Configure the device interface name and the number of logical interfaces.
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id remote-mep mep-id action-profile profile-name interface-group]
     user@host# set interface interface-name
     user@host# set unit-list logical-interface-unit-number
     ```
   - Example:
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md6 maintenance-association ma6 mep 101 remote-mep 102 action-profile AP_test interface-group]
     user@host# set interface ge-0/0/0.0
     user@host# set unit-list 1223-3344
     ```
   - Note: At least one of the interface-group parameters, interface-device-name or unit-list, must be configured. If the interface device name is not configured, the MEP interface is considered the device name, and the logical interface on that device is brought down.

7. **Verify the Configuration:**
   - Use the `show protocols oam` command to verify the configuration.
     ```shell
     [edit]
     user@host# show protocols oam
     ```

### Ethernet Local Management Interface (E-LMI)

#### Overview

Gigabit Ethernet (ge), 10-Gigabit Ethernet (xe), and Aggregated Ethernet (ae) interfaces support the Ethernet Local Management Interface (E-LMI). E-LMI is used for automatic configuration of the customer edge (CE) to support Metro Ethernet services and provides UNI (User-to-Network Interface) and EVC (Ethernet Virtual Connection) status information to the CE.

#### Configuration

1. **Configuring an OAM Protocol (CFM):**
   - Refer to "IEEE 802.1ag OAM Connectivity Fault Management Overview" for detailed configuration steps.

2. **Assigning the OAM Protocol to an EVC:**
   - Specify the EVC name and protocol (CFM or VPLS) at the `[edit protocols oam ethernet evcs evc-id]` hierarchy level.
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet evcs evc-id]
     evc-protocol (cfm (management-domain name management-association name) | vpls (routing-instance name)) {
     remote-uni-count ; # Optional, defaults to 1
     multipoint-to-multipoint; # Optional, defaults to point-to-point if remote-uni-count is 1
     }
     ```

3. **Enabling E-LMI on an Interface and Mapping CE VLAN IDs to an EVC:**
   - Include the `lmi` statement at the `[edit protocols oam ethernet]` hierarchy level.
     ```shell
     [edit protocols oam ethernet]
     lmi {
     polling-verification-timer value; # Polling verification timer (T392), defaults to 15 seconds
     status-counter count; # Status counter (N393), defaults to 4
     interface name {
     evc evc-id {
     default-evc;
     vlan-list [ vlan-ids ];
     }
     evc-map-type (all-to-one-bundling | bundling | service-multiplexing);
     polling-verification-time value; # Optional, defaults to global value
     status-counter count; # Optional, defaults to global value
     uni-id value; # Optional, defaults to interface-name
     }
     }
     ```

### Example Configuration

**Example Topology:**
- **Figure 5: E-LMI Configuration for a Point-to-Point EVC (SVLAN) Monitored by CFM**

**Configuring PE1:**
```shell
[edit]
interfaces {
    ge-1/1/1 {
        unit 0 {
            family bridge {
                interface-mode trunk;
                vlan-id-list 1-2048;
            }
        }
        unit 1 {
            family bridge {
                interface-mode trunk;
                vlan-id-list 2049-4096;
            }
        }
    }
    ge-1/1/2 {
        unit 0 {
            vlan-id 100;
            family bridge {
                interface-mode trunk;
                inner-vlan-id-list 1-2048;
            }
        }
        unit 1 {
            vlan-id 200;
            family bridge {
                interface-mode trunk;
                inner-vlan-id-list 2049-4096;
            }
        }
    }
}
protocols {
```
