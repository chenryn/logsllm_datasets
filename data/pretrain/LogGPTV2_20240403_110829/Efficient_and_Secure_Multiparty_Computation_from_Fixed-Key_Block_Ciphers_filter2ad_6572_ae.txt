since both zi and zj are random.
Fix a good transcript Q = (Qπ,QO, R). The probability
that the ideal world is consistent with Q is exactly (1). The
probability that the real world is consistent with Q is
Pr[∀(w, z) ∈ QO : Ocr
(2k)p
R(w) = z | π (cid:13) Qπ]
· PrR[R].
We can express the numerator above as
q(cid:9)
Pr[Ocr
R(wi) = zi | π (cid:13) Qπ ∧ ∀j < i : Ocr
R(wj) = zj].
i=1
R(wi) = zi iff MMOπ(R ⊕ wi) = zi,
Fix some i. Note that Ocr
i.e., π(R ⊕ wi) = R ⊕ wi ⊕ zi. Moreover, since the transcript
is good there is no query of the form (R ⊕ wi, (cid:6)) in Qπ
(since (B-1) does not occur), nor is π(R ⊕ wi) determined by
the fact that Ocr
R(wj) = zj for all j < i (since all queries
to Ocr
R are distinct). Similarly, there is no query of the form
((cid:6), R ⊕ wi ⊕ zi) in Qπ (since (B-1) does not occur), nor is
π−1(R ⊕ wi ⊕ zi) determined by the fact that Ocr
R(wj) = zj
for all j < i (since (B-2) does not occur). Thus, we have
Pr[Ocr
R(wi) = zi | π (cid:13) Qπ ∧ ∀j < i : Ocr
R(wj) = zj]
= 1/(2k − p − i + 1) ≥ 1/2k
for all i. It follows that
Pr[∀(w, z) ∈ QO : Ocr
R(w) = z | π (cid:13) Qπ] ≥ 1/2kq,
and so the probability that the real world is consistent with
the transcript is at least (1). This completes the proof.
C. Circular Correlation Robustness
We begin by observing that the construction from the pre-
vious section is not circular correlation robust. (To the best of
our knowledge, this gives the ﬁrst explicit separation between
correlation robustness and circular correlation robustness.) To
see this, consider the following distinguisher D given oracle
access to π and an oracle O:
1) Query z := O(x, 1), where x is arbitrary.
2) Query s := π−1(x ⊕ z), and set R∗
3) Query z(cid:3)
Note that if O(x, b) = Occr
then
=
= MMOπ(x ⊕ R) ⊕ b · R
:= O(x(cid:3), 0), for any x(cid:3) (cid:10)= x. Output 1 iff z(cid:3)
MMOπ(x(cid:3) ⊕ R∗
:= x ⊕ s.
R (x, b)
).
def
z = π(x ⊕ R) ⊕ (x ⊕ R) ⊕ R = π(x ⊕ R) ⊕ x.
Thus, R∗
= R and so D always outputs 1. On the other
hand, if O is a random function then D outputs 1 only with
−k.
probability 2
A small change to the previous construction, however, suf-
ﬁces to achieve circular correlation robustness. For a function
σ : {0, 1}k → {0, 1}k that we will ﬁx later, deﬁne
(cid:2)MMO

σ(x)
def
= π(σ(x)) ⊕ σ(x).
We say σ is linear if σ(x ⊕ y) = σ(x) ⊕ σ(y) for all
x, y ∈ {0, 1}k. We say σ is an orthomorphism [12] if it is a
permutation, and the function σ(cid:3) given by σ(cid:3)
is also a permutation.
Theorem 5. Let σ be a linear orthomorphism. If π is modeled
π
as a random permutation then (cid:2)MMO
σ is (p, q, ρ, ε)-circular
correlation robust, where

Clearly H∞(σ(R) ⊕ R) ≤ H∞(R), with equality when

Fix a deterministic distinguisher D making queries to two
oracles. The ﬁrst is a random permutation on {0, 1}k (and its

inverse); the second oracle is Occr
R (for R sampled from R) in the real world, but in the ideal
world it is an independent random function from {0, 1}k+1
to {0, 1}k. Following the notation from Section VII-A, denote
the transcript of D’s interaction by Q = (Qπ,QO, R). We
only consider attainable transcripts from now on.

We say a transcript (Qπ,QO, R) is bad if either:
• (B-1) There is a query (w, b, z) ∈ QO and a query of the
form (σ(R ⊕ w), (cid:6)) or ((cid:6), σ(R ⊕ w) ⊕ bR ⊕ z) in Qπ.
• (B-2) There are distinct (wi, bi, zi), (wj, bj, zj) ∈ QO
such that σ(wi) ⊕ biR ⊕ zi = σ(wj) ⊕ bjR ⊕ zj.
R (w, b) = (cid:2)MMO

We now bound the probabilities of
these events in the
ideal world, beginning with (B-1). For some ﬁxed queries
(w, b, z) ∈ QO and (x, y) ∈ Qπ, we have
Pr[σ(R ⊕ w) = x] = Pr[σ(R) = x ⊕ σ(w)]
−ρ. Similarly,
(where the probability is over choice of R), using the fact
that σ is linear. Since σ is a permutation, this probability is at
most 2
Pr[σ(R⊕ w)⊕ bR⊕ z = y] = Pr[σ(R)⊕ bR = y⊕ σ(w)⊕ z].
−ρ ≤ 2
If b = 0, this probability is at most 2
as before. If
−ρ(cid:2)
b = 1, this probability is at most 2
. Taking a union bound
over all pairs of queries, we thus see that the probability of
(B-1) is at most
−ρ(cid:2)
For (B-2), consider distinct (wi, bi, zi), (wj, bj, zj) ∈ QO.
Note that even if we condition on the value of R, the values
zi, zj are uniform and independent. Thus,
Pr[σ(wi ⊕ wj) ⊕ (bi ⊕ bj) · R = zi ⊕ zj] = 2

Taking a union bound over all distinct pairs of queries, we see
that the probability of (B-2) is at most q2/2k+1.
Fix a good transcript (Qπ,QO, R). The probability that the
ideal world is consistent with this transcript is given by (1).
The probability that the real world is consistent with this
transcript is

R (wi, bi) = zi iff (cid:2)MMO
Note that Occr
σ(R ⊕ wi) ⊕ biR = zi,
i.e., π(σ(R⊕wi)) = σ(R⊕wi)⊕biR⊕zi. Since the transcript
is good there is no query of the form (σ(R ⊕ wi), (cid:6)) in Qπ
(since (B-1) does not occur), nor is π(σ(R⊕ wi)) determined
by the fact that Occr
R (wj, bj) = zj for all j < i (since D does
not make two queries to Occr
R with the same wi). Similarly,
there is no query of the form ((cid:6), σ(R⊕ wi)⊕ biR⊕ zi) in Qπ
(since (B-1) does not occur), nor is π−1(σ(R⊕wi)⊕biR⊕zi)
determined by the fact that Occr
R (wj, bj) = zj for all j < i
(since (B-2) does not occur). Thus, for all i we have
Pr[Occr
R (wi, bi) = zi | π (cid:13) Qπ∧∀j < i : Occr
R (wj, bj) = zj]
= 1/(2k − p − i + 1) ≥ 1/2k.
It follows that
Pr[∀(w, b, z) ∈ QO : Occr
R (w, b) = z | π (cid:13) Qπ] ≥ 1/2kq,
and so the probability that the real world is consistent with
the transcript is at least (1). This completes the proof.
Instantiating σ. There are various ways σ can be instantiated.
Viewing {0, 1}k as the ﬁeld F2k, it is easy to show that for
α (cid:10)= 0, 1 the map σ(x) = α · x is a linear orthomorphism. (A
common choice is α = 2.) A more efﬁcient solution, however,
is given by σ(xL(cid:3)xR) = xR⊕xL(cid:3)xL where xL and xR are the
left and right halves of the input, respectively. This orthomor-
phism has received a lot attention in the context of symmetric-
key cryptography [12], and we show in Section VIII that it
can be implemented using a small number of instructions on
modern CPUs.
D. Tweakable (Circular) Correlation Robustness
We show here a construction of a hash function that is
tweakable circular correlation robust, and hence also tweak-
able correlation robust. (It is an interesting open question
to come up with a more efﬁcient construction satisfying the
weaker notion only.) Deﬁne
TMMOπ(x, i) = π(π(x) ⊕ i) ⊕ π(x).
Note that TMMOπ can be computed using only two calls to π.
Theorem 6. Let p < 2k/2. If π is modeled as a random
permutation then TMMOπ is (p, q, ρ, ε)-tweakable circular
correlation robust, where

Proof. Fix a deterministic distinguisher D making queries to
two oracles. The ﬁrst is a random permutation on {0, 1}k
the second oracle is
(and its inverse);
R (w, i, b) = TMMOπ(R ⊕ w, i) ⊕ b · R (for R sampled
Otccr
from R), but
is a random function
from {0, 1}2k+1 to {0, 1}k. Following the notation from
Section VII-A, denote the transcript of D’s interaction by
Q = (Qπ,QO, R). We only consider attainable transcripts.
We say a transcript (Qπ,QO, R) is bad if:
• (B-1) There is a query (wj, ij, bj, zj) ∈ QO and a query
of the form (R ⊕ wj, (cid:6)) in Qπ.
• (B-2) There is a query (wj, ij, bj, zj) ∈ QO such that
bjR ⊕ zj = 0k.
• (B-3) There are distinct (wj, ij, bj, zj), (w(cid:2), i(cid:2), b(cid:2), z(cid:2)) ∈
QO such that bjR ⊕ zj = b(cid:2)R ⊕ z(cid:2).
It is immediate that the probability of (B-1) in the ideal world
is at most pq/2ρ. Since each zj is uniform and independent
of R, it is similarly easy to see that the probability of (B-2) in
the ideal world is at most q/2k, and the probability of (B-3)
in the ideal world is at most q2/2k+1.
Fix a good transcript Q = (Qπ,QO, R). Letting QO =
{(w1, i1, b1, z1), . . .} as above, deﬁne uj = R ⊕ wj for 1 ≤
j ≤ q, and set U = {u1, . . . , uq}. Fixing some π (cid:13) Qπ, we
may deﬁne vj = π(uj), sj = vj ⊕ ij, and tj = zj ⊕ vj ⊕ bjR;
set V = {v1, . . . , vq}. Deﬁne a predicate Bad(π) on π, which
is true if any of the following hold:
• (C-1) For some 1 ≤ j ≤ q, there is a query of the form
(sj, (cid:6)) in Qπ, or sj ∈ U.
• (C-2) For some 1 ≤ j ≤ q, there is a query of the form
((cid:6), tj) in Qπ, or tj ∈ V.
• (C-3) There are distinct i, j, with 1 ≤ j < (cid:5) ≤ q, such
that sj = s(cid:2) or tj = t(cid:2).
We bound the probability of the above events when π is a
uniform permutation, conditioned on π (cid:13) Qπ.
Consider (C-1). Fixing some index j, recall that
sj = vj ⊕ ij = π(R ⊕ wj) ⊕ ij.
Since Q is good, π(R⊕ wj) is uniform in a set of size at least
2k − p (and thus so is sj). Therefore,
Pr[∃(x, y) ∈ Qπ : sj = x] ≤ p
2k − p
≤ 2p
2k
,
using p < 2k/2. Similarly,
Pr[sj ∈ U] ≤ |U|
2k − p
≤ 2q
2k
(note that U is deﬁned independent of π). Taking a union
bound over all j, we see that the probability of (C-1) is at
most 2q(p + q)/2k.

Next consider (C-2). Fixing some index j, recall that tj =
zj ⊕ vj ⊕ bjR = zj ⊕ π(R ⊕ wj) ⊕ bjR and so, arguing as
above, we have
Pr[∃(x, y) ∈ Qπ : tj = y] ≤ p
Fixing some v(cid:2) ∈ V, we have tj = v(cid:2) iff
