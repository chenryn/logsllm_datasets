Before submitting your issue, please ensure that the following items have been addressed. Thank you for your cooperation.

- I have reviewed the Superset logs for any Python stack traces and included them in the text below if applicable.
- I have confirmed that the issue persists with at least the most recent released version of Superset.
- I have searched the issue tracker and have not found a similar issue already reported.

### Superset Version
0.24.0

### Expected Results
I would like to create a dual-axis chart that combines both a line chart and a bar chart to visualize two different types of data on the same plot. However, I am unable to achieve this using Superset.

### Actual Results
Superset does not currently support the creation of multi-chart (dual-axis) visualizations, which is a necessary feature for my use case.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. I need to display the correlation between two variables.
2. One variable is continuous and should be represented as a line chart.
3. The other variable is non-continuous and needs to be shown as a bar chart to illustrate its trends over time.
4. When attempting to set up a dual-axis chart within Superset, the option to combine a line and bar chart is not available, leading to an inability to properly compare these two sets of data.
