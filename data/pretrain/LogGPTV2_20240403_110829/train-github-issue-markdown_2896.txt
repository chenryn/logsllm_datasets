  * I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if any
  * I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset
  * I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar
### Superset version
0.24.0
### Expected results
I need to show dual axis char but with line and bar chart. Not able to create
that in superset
### Actual results
It should support multi charts
### Steps to reproduce
Need to see the correlation between 2 variables, but one of them is not
continuous, so cannot use a line chart and need a bar chart for its trending.
