##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
user
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.0.0
      config file = /ansible/configuration/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
RHEL6 on both source and target
##### SUMMARY
The "user" module has an "expires" option to set up the expiration date of a
user. This option is using the Epoch format (not very helpful), and it seems
it does not take into account the timezone.  
In my case, it means that setting a user to expire on 2017-02-18 00:00:00, the
user actually expired on 2017-02-17 00:00:00, 24 hours earlier.
Since all my systems are set with the CET timezone, I fully expect that an
expiration date set using that timezone to be applied consistent to it.  
Since the Linux expiration is set using a number of days, and not seconds,
it's confusing to say the least to have to deal with a proper time.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Convert a date to Epoch format, this is in local CET timezone:
    $ date -d "2017-02-18 00:59:59" +%s
    1487375999
Use that value in the "user" module to set a user's expiry date, run the task,
then check the actual expiry date:
    $ sudo chage -l user
    Last password change                                : Feb 14, 2017
    Password expires                                    : never
    Password inactive                                   : never
    Account expires                                     : Feb 17, 2017
    Minimum number of days between password change      : 0
    Maximum number of days between password change      : 99999
    Number of days of warning before password expires   : 7
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I expect the expiry date to be set to the one I used.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
The expiry date was set 24 hours earlier than expected.
#### Note
A case was initially opened with RedHat support.
