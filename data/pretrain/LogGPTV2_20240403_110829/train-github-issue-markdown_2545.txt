### Issue Type
- Bug Report

### Component Name
- User Module

### Ansible Version
- Ansible 2.2.0.0
  - Configuration file: `/ansible/configuration/ansible.cfg`
  - Configured module search path: Default (no overrides)

### Operating System / Environment
- RHEL6 on both the source and target systems

### Summary
The `user` module in Ansible provides an `expires` option to set the expiration date for a user. This option uses the Epoch format, which is not very user-friendly. Additionally, it appears that the `expires` option does not account for time zones.

In my case, setting a user to expire on February 18, 2017, at 00:00:00 (CET) resulted in the user actually expiring on February 17, 2017, at 00:00:00, 24 hours earlier than expected. Since all my systems are configured with the CET time zone, I expect the expiration date to be applied consistently within this time zone.

Given that Linux sets the expiration date using the number of days rather than seconds, the requirement to use a specific time is confusing and error-prone.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Convert a date to Epoch format, assuming the local time zone is CET:
   ```sh
   $ date -d "2017-02-18 00:59:59" +%s
   1487375999
   ```

2. Use this value in the `user` module to set the user's expiry date, then run the task.
3. Check the actual expiry date:
   ```sh
   $ sudo chage -l user
   Last password change                                : Feb 14, 2017
   Password expires                                    : never
   Password inactive                                   : never
   Account expires                                     : Feb 17, 2017
   Minimum number of days between password change      : 0
   Maximum number of days between password change      : 99999
   Number of days of warning before password expires   : 7
   ```

### Expected Results
- The expiry date should be set to the one specified (February 18, 2017, 00:00:00).

### Actual Results
- The expiry date was set 24 hours earlier than expected (February 17, 2017, 00:00:00).

### Additional Notes
- A support case was initially opened with Red Hat.
