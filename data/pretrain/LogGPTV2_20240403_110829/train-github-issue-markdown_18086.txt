What is the current behavior?
Cannot set property 'memoizedState' of null
If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if
possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if
we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste
the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox
(https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:
const processLink = html => {  
return renderToStaticMarkup()  
};
const RichText = ({ html }) => {  
const htmlProcessed = useMemo(() => processLink(html), [html]);  
}
