User: Sometimes I can save a script by using Ctrl+S when using IDLE, but then other times it fails to save for no reason, as haven't changed anything. Is this a bug of some kind? It's starting to irritate me.
Platform: Windows 7 Professional
Assistant: It may be some character. I faced that same trouble, then I removed some character, such as "Ã‡" and it worked fine.
