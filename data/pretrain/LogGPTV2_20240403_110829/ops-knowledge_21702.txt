User: I have a python script (wap.py) from which I am calling wapiti asynchronously using Popen. Command for it in wap.py:
p = Popen("python  wapiti domainName", shell = True)
When I am running wap.py, it is executing completely fine.
But when I am running it using php exec, it doesn't work.
Command from php file : exec("python wap.py")
Assistant: Look at the php.ini to see if there's anything set for disable_functions. If you're using PHP CLI for the script, you can execute the following command in the shell:
php -i | grep disable_functions
Also make sure wap.py has execute permissions.
