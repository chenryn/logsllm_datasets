User: I have the source code to a python package that is typically installed using pup or easy-install. How do I locally install the code after I've made changes? I'd like to be able to run commands on the terminal as if I've installed it with pip and then reinstall/have it detect code changes to try it again.
Assistant: You can use pip -e install <path-to-package> to install a package in editable mode. Then, you can make changes to the source code, and not have to install it again.
This is best done, as always, in a virtualenv, so it is isolated from the rest of your system.
