# Penetration Test Executive Report

## Introduction
This report details the findings of a penetration test, including the current risk level of tested systems, identified vulnerabilities, and recommendations for remediation. The report also includes additional value-added items and considerations for future services.

## Risk Levels and Vulnerabilities
### Definitions
- **Critical**: Immediate threat to key business processes.
- **High**: Indirect threat to key business processes or direct threat to secondary business processes.
- **Medium**: Indirect or partial threat to business processes.
- **Low**: No direct threat; vulnerability may be leveraged in combination with other vulnerabilities.

### Current Risk Level
The current risk level of the tested systems is **Critical**. During testing, the following vulnerabilities were identified:

| Vulnerability | Severity |
|--------------|----------|
| Vulnerability A | Critical  |
| Vulnerability B | Medium   |
| Vulnerability C | Medium   |
| Vulnerability D | Low      |
| Vulnerability E | Low      |

### Summary Table
- **Total Hosts Scanned**: 9
- **Ports Scanned**: TCP, UDP, 1-65535
- **Vulnerability Severity**:
  - **Critical**: 1 (unique: 1)
  - **Medium**: 2 (unique: 2)
  - **Low**: 2 (unique: 2)

**Note**: "Unique" refers to the number of different vulnerabilities found within a risk level. For example, if five high-level vulnerabilities were found but only three are unique, some vulnerabilities are present on more than one system.

## Vulnerability Details
Each identified vulnerability should include the following details:
- **Vulnerability Name**
- **Business Criticality**
- **Description**
- **Technical Details**
- **Affected Systems and Ports**
- **Recommended Action**

## Additional Value-Added Items
To provide additional value, the report can include the following:
- **Configuration Differences**: Start-up and running configurations for devices.
- **Best Practice Deviations**: Identified deviations from best practices.
- **IPv6 Support**: Compliance with IPv6 requirements.
- **End-of-Sale or End-of-Life Devices**: Identification of outdated equipment.
- **VoIP and Video Capabilities**: Support for future technologies.
- **Compliance**: Adherence to common standards such as FISMA and PCI.
- **Device Inventory**: List of serial numbers, IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc.
- **Network Topology**: Detailed network diagram.
- **Available Protocols and Public Data**: Information on exposed protocols and data.

## Network Considerations and Recommendations
### Recommendations
- **Patch Management Program**: Implement a robust patch management program to reduce the risk of running vulnerable systems.
- **Change Control**: Enforce strong change control processes to prevent misconfigurations.
- **Multifactor Authentication**: Leverage multifactor and role-based access control for critical systems.
- **Access Restriction**: Isolate critical systems using whitelists, ACLs, VLANs, and other methods.
- **Regular Vulnerability Assessments**: Conduct regular assessments to validate the current state of risk.
- **High Availability**: Ensure failover options for mission-critical systems.

### Example Recommendation
- **Implement a Patch Management Program**: Follow NIST SP 800-408 guidelines to develop security policies for proper patch management.
- **Enforce Change Control**: Adopt a strong change and control process to avoid common vulnerabilities caused by human error.
- **Leverage Multifactor Authentication**: Use at least two forms of authentication and limit administrative account access.
- **Restrict Access**: Isolate critical systems using various methods to limit damage from compromised resources.
- **Conduct Regular Assessments**: Use NIST SP 800-309 guidelines for an effective risk management program.
- **Ensure High Availability**: Develop failover options for mission-critical systems to avoid single points of failure.

## Appendices
Appendices provide additional information that is not essential to the main findings but is useful for reference. This may include:
- **Nessus Vulnerability Scanning Reports**
- **Captured Screenshots**
- **Other Supporting Documents**

## Glossary
A glossary defines terms used in the report, including technical definitions and compliance terms.
