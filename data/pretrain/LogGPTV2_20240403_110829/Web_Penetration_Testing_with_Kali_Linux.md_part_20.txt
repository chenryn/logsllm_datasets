not meeting a mandated standard or explanation of a known vulnerability from a
reputable source.
Example:
• Critical: Immediate threat to key business processes
• High: Indirect threat to key business processes / threat to secondary
business processes
• Medium: Indirect / partial threat to business processes
• Low: No direct threat exists; vulnerability may be leverage with other
vulnerabilities

Penetration Test Executive Report
The current risk level of systems tested, based on the highest risk level of findings in
systems is Critical during the testing, a total of one (1) Critical, two (2) Medium, and
two (2) Low vulnerabilities were identified as shown in the following screenshot:
Vulnerability Severity
Vulnerability A Critical
Vulnerability B Medium
Vulnerability C Medium
Vulnerability D Low
Vulnerability E Low
Summery table for assessment findings
Scan Type Total
Hosts 9
Ports TCP, UDP, 1-65535
Vulnerability Severity Total
Critical 1 (unique:1)
Medium 2 (unique:2)
Low 2 (unique:2)
Unique is defined as the number of different vulnerabilities found
within a risk level. For example, if five high-level vulnerabilities were
found, but three are Unique, than some of the vulnerabilities are
present on more than one system.
Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities found should include a clear description about the source of the
weakness, impact to business operations and likelihood of being exploited. Reports
should also list how the vulnerability was identified along with, if it was validated,
meaning was the vulnerability exploited or just identified as a possible vulnerability
during a scan. Vulnerabilities in a customer's architecture could include a diagram
explaining the problem with captured traffic flow so customers can qualify the
recommendation.
Some details that could be included for identified Vulnerabilities in a delivery report
are as follows:
• Vulnerability name
• Business criticality
• Vulnerability description

Penetration Test Executive Report
There may be general findings you would want to include beyond vulnerable
systems to show additional value. For example, there is a mandate that all US
federal agencies have equipment capable of supporting IPv6. Not having this isn't
necessarily a vulnerability; however, something a US federal customer would be
interested in knowing. Another example would be supporting future technologies,
such as capabilities for Voice over IP (VoIP), and video.
Following is a suggested list for items to include in Penetration Testing services to
show additional value:
• Difference in start-up and running configurations for devices
• Best practice deviation
• Support for IPv6
• End of sale or end of life devices
• Support for capabilities required for VoIP and video
• Compliance to common standards such as FISMA, PCI
• List of serial numbers, IP address, MAC, and so on of devices found
• Network topology
• Available protocols and public facing data
Network considerations and
recommendations
This section explains recommendations to remediate items found from services
provided. Recommendations can range from high-level suggestions, such as "patch
this system", to very detailed steps to close a vulnerability. Some remediation steps
could impact other services, such as closing ports to defend from a specific attack,
which also cripples another system that utilizes that channel for communication. It
is important to include warnings of possible negative impact with any suggested
remediation along with confirming that steps provided do not guarantee to fix the
problem or bring a system into compliance with a specific regulation. The last thing
you would want is a customer being compromised post services and point blame
at you for not providing successful remediation steps to a vulnerability identified
during your services.
[ 292 ]

Chapter 8
It is very important to state in a deliverable report what guarantees
or coverages are included post services. Customers that fail an audit
may assume your previous services are liable if you do not state your
services, do not guarantee meeting specific mandates or requirements.
For example, there is a huge difference between having a PCI report
included with services, compared to actually contracting a PCI expert
in reviewing all aspects of the regulation with the customer's network,
in a similar method used by auditors.
There are many levels of remediation. Sometimes how the network in architecture
exposes a weakness, but other times it's a gap in policy, configuration, or
missing patch. Items to include for recommendations are summary of findings,
high-level and detailed recommendations for remediation, other useful data
outside of requested items, such as IPv6 capabilities, changes in network design,
recommendations for hardware, software, patches, and compliance summary.
Example:
We commend CUSTOMER for being proactive in managing technology risk and
network security through procuring our services. Due to the impact to the overall
organization as uncovered by this Penetration test, appropriate resources are
recommended to be allocated to ensure that remediation efforts are accomplished
in a timely manner. Although a comprehensive list of items that should be
implemented is beyond the scope of this engagement, some high level items are
important to mention.
• Implement a patch management program: Many identified vulnerabilities
could be avoided with proper patch management. We recommend following
the guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-408 as a source for developing
security policies for proper patch management. This will reduce the risk of
running vulnerable systems.
• Enforce change control across all systems: Common vulnerabilities are
caused by human error. Many misconfiguration issues could be avoided
through a strong change and control process on all active systems
• Leverage multifactor and role-based access control: Some critical systems
were found leveraging password security as the only means of validating
authorized individuals. Best practice is having at least two forms of
authentication, along with limiting administration account access.
• Restrict access to critical systems: Critical systems should be isolated from
other systems using whitelists, ACLs, VLANs and other means. The design
concept of least privilege will limit the amount of damage an attacker can
inflict using a compromised resource. Consult NIST SP 800-27 RevA11 for
guidelines on achieving a security baseline for IT systems.

• Conduct regular vulnerability assessments: Vulnerability assessments
should be conducted on a regular basis as a means to validate the current
state of risk to the organization. Consult NIST SP 800-309 for guidelines on
operating an effective risk management program.
• Include High Availability for critical systems and networks: During our
assessment, we found single points of failure for mission-critical systems.
Best practice is developing failover options in the event of network failure.
An example for an improved traffic to the core datacenter is adding
redundant systems to the data center network as shown below.

Appendices
An appendix lists additional information related to the deliverable report typically
not essential to the main findings. This is for reference purposes and could contain
results from scanning, captured screenshots, and other information.
Example:
Appendix 001- Nessus Vulnerability Scanning Reports
Glossary
A glossary is used to define the meaning of terms used in the proposal. This could
be for technical definitions, specifying requirements behind referenced compliance
terms, or other areas that may need further clarification.

Statement of Work (SOW)
Before you offer Penetration services, you may need to write a Statement of Work
(SOW) that outlines the work you are going to perform. This is typically the first step
you would want to complete with your stakeholders before starting a project.
When writing a SOW, we recommend you follow a format that will ultimately
represent your reporting structure. The basic format of a Statement of Work
documents include the following:
• Executive report: A high-level summary of the work you are doing, what
you hope to accomplish, and your target audience..
Example of SOW executive summary is as follows:
The SERVICE PROVIDER is pleased to present the CUSTOMER with our
methodology for conducting a security assessment. The principal objective of
CUSTOMER for initiating this engagement is to evaluate the current level of risk
and exposure adequately within the organization with a focused view to develop
and/or implement solutions that will help reduce critical threats and ultimately
mitigate relevant risk.
In response to the needs of CUSTOMER, SERVICE PROVIDER has outlined an
effective security assessment strategy that has proven to be very successful in
elevating the security posture in many similar organizations. Our approach begins
with understanding the business requirements associated with the assessment,
followed by a detailed topology mapping and base-lining of the existing
infrastructure identified to be in scope. Upon completion of the discovery of the
infrastructure, we begin a systematic vulnerability assessment of critical systems and
network devices to identify threat vectors that may be behavioral in nature. A careful
exploitation method is then reviewed and executed to identify the relevance of
vulnerabilities that have been detected. Techniques such as Penetration Testing and
social engineering may be employed during this phase. Lastly, we undergo weekly
status briefings throughout the life cycle of the engagement to review activities
for the week and communicate key goals and objectives for the upcoming weeks.
This provides CUSTOMER an opportunity to inform our engineers of any system
upgrades in progress that require special consideration. SERVICE PROVIDER
provides credible project management expertise to ensure operational excellence and
a superior customer experience in all our engagements and this is no exception.
SERVICE PROVIDER recognizes a consistent business need to assess and improve the
security posture of an organization continually, and we believe that this engagement
will help in reducing operational expenses from minimized risks and downtime while
also providing data protection and brand reputation benefits to CUSTOMER.

Furthermore, the insight gained from such an exercise is crucial in planning for
future services that will enable business performance and profitability. These benefits
are consistent and well aligned with the CUSTOMER's objectives listed as follows:
• Gain a better understanding of potential CUSTOMER network vulnerabilities
and security risks
• Determine critical security architecture weakness within the CUSTOMER
infrastructure
• Evaluate the security associated with the CUSTOMER website and
external-facing applications
• Activity report: A report of all executed exploits (available in three
levels of detail).
• Host report: Detailed host information, including the number of
compromised computers, the average number of vulnerabilities
exploited on each computer, and the CVE names of vulnerabilities
found on each computer.
• Vulnerability report: A detailed report of successfully exploited, versus
potential, vulnerabilities on each computer.
• Client-side Penetration Test report: A full audit trail of each client-side
Penetration Testing, including the email template sent, exploit launched,
test results (success or failure), and details about compromised systems.
• User report: A client-side testing report of which links were clicked, when
they were clicked, and by whom.
External Penetration Testing
Special consideration should to be given to Penetration Testing from external
sources. An external Penetration Testing SOW identifies your target and possible
steps you are willing to take during your attack. The SOW also defines when you
will stop testing or what circumstances are beyond scope. In other words, the SOW
gives you a stopping point.
The next example shows an external Penetration Testing summary. It includes a
quick overview of the testing process, followed by an outline with step-by-step
instructions of the work that will be performed. This example also outlines the
client and application owner's responsibility.
External web test SOW example:
[ 296 ]

Chapter 8
The central objective of our external and web Penetration Testing effort is to exploit
the inherent security weaknesses of the network perimeter, web domain, and web
application delivery. Adjacent application delivery elements, including backend
databases and middleware, are also included in this domain and are evaluated
as well. Common vulnerabilities and exploits that we focus on during this phase
are the ones related to buffer overflows, SQL injections, and cross-site scripting.
Our engineers may also engage in a manual navigation of the web domain to
extract other pieces of sensitive and critical data. Furthermore, as requested by the
CUSTOMER, devices in the DMZ will also be included in this Penetration Testing
exercise in an attempt to logically break down the defenses surrounding the web
application domain.
Detailed testing procedures:
SERVICE PROVIDER will complete the following testing procedures for the web
application domain:
• Identify the servers to be tested, based on the customer's web site, and crawl
a website to harvest addresses published on the site.
• Leverage major search engines to locate addresses for a given domain.
• Find addresses in PGP and WHOIS databases.
• Launch multiple, simultaneous attacks to speed the Penetration Testing
process.
• Interact with compromised machines via discrete agents that are installed
only in system memory.
• Run local exploits to attack machines internally, rather than from across the
network.
• Analyze custom, customized, and out-of-the-box web applications for
security weaknesses.
• Validate security exposures using dynamically generated exploits, emulating
a hacker trying various attack paths and methods.
• Demonstrate the consequences of an attack by interacting with web server
file systems and databases through command shells and database consoles.
• Perform Penetration Tests without corrupting web applications or running
code on targeted servers.
Customer responsibilities are as follows:
• Identify the web domain's for which web assessment will be performed.
Communicate service maintenance and/or impacts during Penetration Tests.
• Ensure web accessibility to domains and perimeter devices in scope if not
publicly available.

Additional SOW material
Other areas to consider when writing a scope of work should be considered. Some of
the common content recommended to include are as follow:
• Legal and testing release: Usually this is preapproved verbiage from lawyers
excluding the application owners from holding the service provider liable for
any damages caused by the Penetration Test.
• Methodology and approach: This is how you plan to conduct the Penetration
Test (rules of engagement), how the customer receives updates, timelines,
and how the customer can provide input. The following diagram provides an
example of a SOW methodology:
Mapping
and
Discovery
Baseline
Security Policies
Audit and Security Standards Evaluate and
Remediation

• Price: How long will the work take to complete and how much will it cost.
This can be broken down into project phases and should include notation
when expected hours could potentially exceed projected pricing.
• Expectations and responsibilities: What the service provider and customer
are assigned during the project lifecycle. There should be notations when
steps required by either the service provider or customer is a prerequisite to a
future stage of the project.
[ 298 ]

Chapter 8
• Credentials and tools: Customers typically verify credentials held by the
staff conducting audits as well as what tools might be used to complete
tasks. Providing this information in a SOW adds a degree of credibility
and professionalism. Providing the potential toolset upfront also reduces
the likelihood of the customer having a negative reaction when a negative
impact occurs due to the use of a tool.
The following example shows a table that highlights a sample Penetration Rester's
expertise along with tools that will be used:
