User: I try to:  

easy_install lxml

and I get this error:

File "build/bdist.macosx-10.3-fat/egg/setuptools/command/build_ext.py", line 85, in get_ext_filename
  KeyError: 'etree'

any hints?
Assistant: Ned :

incompatible changes in the 2.6.3 version of python's distutil

Not precisely. The API hasn't changed but Setuptools overrides them, and makes the assumption they are called in a particular order.
Lennart:

The Distribute installation doesn't seem to trigger the bug

Yes indeed, this precise bug was detected some time ago and fixed in Distribute (and in Ubuntu's setuptools package)
