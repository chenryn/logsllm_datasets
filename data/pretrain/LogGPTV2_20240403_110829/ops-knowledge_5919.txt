When I attempt to run `easy_install lxml`, I encounter the following error:

```
File "build/bdist.macosx-10.3-fat/egg/setuptools/command/build_ext.py", line 85, in get_ext_filename
  KeyError: 'etree'
```

Do you have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?

**Ned:**
This problem is not due to incompatible changes in Python's distutils (version 2.6.3). The API itself has not changed. However, Setuptools overrides certain methods and assumes they are called in a specific order, which may cause issues.

**Lennart:**
The bug does not seem to occur with Distribute. This particular issue was identified and fixed in both Distribute and Ubuntu's setuptools package.
