## Introduction
### The Claim
"We should give our obedience to an unaccountable sovereign, otherwise what awaits us is a 'state of nature' that closely resembles civil war – a situation of universal insecurity." — Thomas Hobbes

Terrorism, cybercrime, and foreign espionage are examples that support politicians' claims for increased state power over online life. However, the current use of cyber offensive tools is often aimed at political objectives rather than public safety.

### Opposing Evidence
- **Espionage:** Stealing of information and personal data for political purposes (e.g., opposition parties, NGOs, ethnic minorities).
- **Surveillance/Eavesdropping:** Untargeted violations of privacy, such as monitoring of behavior, activities, or other changing information of people online.
- **Censorship:** Blocking specific applications or technologies, filtering and blocking of websites, manipulation of content or traffic, and violations of user rights.

## Sources
### Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Reports
- **Total Reports/Posts:** 758 from vendors, NGOs, CSIRTs, and universities.
- **Dataset Bias:** Approximately 80% of the dataset has a Western perspective.
- **Key Providers:** Hacking Team and Gamma Group.
- **Data Availability:** Multiple sources, including WikiLeaks, which offers a robust search platform.
- **Acquisition of Technology:** Surveillance and/or intrusion technologies reported from various sources, indicating potential cyber capabilities in different countries.

### Leaks from Spyware Providers
- **Focus on Targets:** Attacks targeting NGOs, political groups, media outlets, or opposition were considered indicators of state misbehavior.

### Censorship and Transparency Reports
- **Evidence of Censorship:** Freedom House, OONI, Google, Reporters without Borders, and OpenNet provide evidence of online censorship, including blocking applications, technologies, and websites, and violations of user rights.
- **Transparency Reports:** Issued by major social networks and content providers (Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Apple, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Tumblr, Dropbox, Wiki, Microsoft, and WordPress).
