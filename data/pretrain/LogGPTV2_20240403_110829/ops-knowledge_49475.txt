User: I am trying to install the icehouse openstack on Ubuntu 12.04 amd64, which is in VirtualBox. I am using devstack to do so. So, I am executing the script "stack.sh". While executing it throws this error:

IOError:[Error 2]No such file or directory: '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/setuptools.egg-info'

I even updated and upgraded the Ubuntu (by running the command sudo apt-get update/upgrade),before downloading the devstack and it took a long time, but even after that, the error still comes.
Assistant: artemdevel is right!
Run the following and you should be good to go :
sudo rm /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/setuptools.egg-info
sudo apt-get install --reinstall python-setuptools
