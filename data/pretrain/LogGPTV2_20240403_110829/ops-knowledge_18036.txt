User: Please analyze the front-end performance problem of a web application and provide optimization suggestions.
Assistant: 1. Slow page loading speed: If the page loading speed is too slow, the user experience will be affected and users may be lost. Optimization suggestions: Use caching technology, delay loading js, compress images, use CDN and other methods to shorten page loading time. 2. Slow page response time: When the user enters or clicks on a page element, the page does not respond immediately. Optimization suggestions: optimize the js code, avoid excessive DOM operations, and move resources to CDN and other servers to reduce the load on the server. 3. Page incompatibility: On different devices and browsers, the page will display differently. Optimization suggestions: Use responsive design techniques, select appropriate frameworks and components, and adapt CSS to achieve cross-terminal compatibility. 4. Inadequate error handling: When the website fails to function properly or an error occurs, the user does not get a clear prompt or error message. Optimization suggestion: For common errors, provide readable error prompts, and use logging and analysis tools to identify and resolve common errors. 5. Too many pictures: If there are too many pictures on a page, the page loading speed will be slow and the user experience will be affected. Optimization suggestions: For large images, use image compression, lazy load or image lazy loading, optimize the image format, and upload images to CDN to improve user experience.
