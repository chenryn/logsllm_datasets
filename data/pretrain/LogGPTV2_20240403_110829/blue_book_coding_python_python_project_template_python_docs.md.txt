Creating documentation concurrently with your coding process is crucial. Delaying this task often leads to it being either neglected or becoming an overwhelming burden.

Currently, I utilize [MkDocs](mkdocs.md) in conjunction with GitHub Pages for generating and hosting project documentation. To get started, follow the instructions provided in the [Installation](mkdocs.md#installation) section.
