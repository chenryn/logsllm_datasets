of time per week or month to teaching computer skills, such as
typing, logging onto email, and clicking on links (T1, T3, T4).
ESL classes can also include discussions about security, like
how to avoid scams or how to understand if a news source
is reliable, but security is not the main goal of the class.
Nevertheless teachers report that refugees do share with them
their passwords, so that the teachers can help them log into
their email accounts (T2, T3). This act raises questions of
refugee autonomy when interacting with computers, as well
as the question of who else they must share their passwords
with in order to achieve their computing objectives.
Case managers and teachers reported that refugees had
complete trust for teachers; T2 suggested that “because I have
a relationship with the students on a day-to-day basis, they
trust me maybe more so than they trust their case managers.”
3) ROLE OF THE COMMUNITY
Newly resettled refugees ﬁnd communities of others from
their country who speak their language. These communities
are a major source of cultural and security knowledge. R3a
said she heard of scams from her community, but only after it
was too late and she had already been scammed. This situation
speaks both to the role of communities in sharing security-
related knowledge, and the fact that scams may be an unknown
concept to refugees.
In addition to explicit security advice, participants told
us that that refugees receive advice about American culture
and “ofﬁcial” offenses. CM2 said that relatives, friends, and
people in the community “will tell you, ‘Okay, never make
any mistake with parking or trafﬁc accidents,’ or anything like
that. Never have any illegal things. Immediately they will try
to scare you or train you mentally like that.”
Both these examples speak to the broader observations that
refugees form their security practices in part from the advice
of others in their communities, in addition to advice from their
case managers, teachers, and ofﬁcial resettlement orientations.
4) REFUGEE GOALS IN THE US
Finally, we provide additional context about
refugees’
broader goals once they arrive in the US. Understanding these
goals is critical
to our efforts to understand and improve
computer security and privacy for this population, since, as
we discuss further below, commonly recommended security
practices can be in tension with these core goals.
• Establish their lives in the US. Teachers and case man-
agers expressed that the foremost concern for refugees is
reestablishing their lives: obtaining housing and, most of
all, getting a job (T1, T2, CM3, CM4, CM5). Achieving
these goals requires navigating web pages ﬁlled with
jargon, ﬁlling out online forms, and sending emails to
various agencies and companies.
• Keep in touch with family and friends. Refugees’ families
and friends are often scattered around the world. Partic-
ipants often described refugees’ use of messaging apps
or social media in the context of exchanging news with
distant friends and family (T2, T3, T4, CM2, CM3, CM5,
R1ab, R3ce).
• Learn US culture and English. Refugees need a working
knowledge of English to thrive in a job, so they attend
ESL class four times a week to learn English. Sometimes,
T3 speculated,
their desire to learn English and US
culture leads them to be insufﬁciently skeptical of people
speaking English. We also observe throughout our results
that both technical and US cultural knowledge are needed
for many common security features.
• Increase technology use. Although teachers and case
managers said that they sometimes had to pressure their
clients to use technology (T2, T3, CM3, CM4), we also
heard about clients who were excited about using email
and the internet to connect with faraway friends and
family (T2, T3, T4, CM1). “For students who understand
it, it’s really exciting because it’s a new way to connect
with the world. They’ll get a new email address and
they’ll be like, ‘I hear my brother has an email,’ and
we’re like, ‘Yeah, you can write your brother now.’ ” (T4).
With increased proﬁciency on the computer, refugees can
apply for jobs by themselves, but may also increase their
risk to computer security threats.
B. Refugee Security Barriers
Given the above context, we now turn to our second core
research question: what barriers inhibit the implementation of
strong security and privacy practices among refugees?
Past Experiences: Trauma. Many refugees feared surveil-
lance and government-perpetrated violence in their home
countries. Among our study population, the countries about
which we heard concerns expressed included Eritrea, Syria,
and Iraq; by contrast, we heard that there were not such
concerns in Somalia (CM2, R3c).
Case managers identiﬁed a fundamental difference with
“[those who] were born in, for example, a stabilized country,
they are different than people who come from a war, who are
suppressed,” (CM5) such as those from Eritrea, Syria, and
Iraq. CM5 said that in Iraq, “the walls have ears,” meaning
that anyone, even the neighbors, could be reporting back to the
government. “You never know who’s listening and you could
be killed for it, you could disappear overnight for it” (CM3).
CM2 drew a distinction between Somali clients, who “talk
[about] anything they want” and Eritrean clients, who “you
never see. . . talking about the government or anything like
that.” Compared to a country with censorship, CM1 explained,
“in Eritrea. . . you can use [any website]. There is not any
problem. The problem is on what
things you are writing
or you are speaking.” T2 and CM4 additionally identiﬁed
trauma from the past as an irrational but unavoidable factor
in refugees’ decisions to trust certain people or entities. As
we discuss in Section V-C, refugees must trust people — such
as their case managers — for assistance, when establishing
themselves in the US.

Language: Dependence on Assistance. Refugees face lin-
guistic barriers (T1, T2, T3, T4, CM2, CM3, CM5), increasing
their reliance on others for help with tasks that must be
completed in English, like a job or housing application. The
impact of this language barrier manifests in multiple ways,
ranging from email account management, to website validity
veriﬁcation, to scam avoidance.
Culture: Awareness of Risks. We also found that while
certain types of security risks are well-known within US
culture, they are new concepts to many refugees. Consider,
for example, scams and identity theft. From our interviews,
we observed that a concern for identity theft and scams was
typically instilled by case managers, teachers, or others over
time, or through direct experiences (e.g., R3a was scammed
twice before learning to be cautious), rather than a concern
refugees brought with them from their home countries. Case
managers and teachers suggested that refugees were surprised
by the possibility of such threats: “They always ask me why.
‘Why would they do that? Why would they take my social
security?’ . . . They’re surprised that [on] this side of
the
world, somebody will go through all this hassle just to destroy
somebody’s identity or life” (CM3). T3 remarked, “I don’t
think they have the idea that there might be something that
could be potentially risky for them in their inbox” (T3). CM4
suggested that the novelty of these types of threats may cause
refugees to treat their personal information with insufﬁcient
caution: “Imagine someone who has no exposure or little
knowledge about computer hacking.1 They can’t believe, and
they can simply provide all information.”
Case managers emphasized that there are refugees who are
already skeptical of putting their information on the internet
(though they may be a minority), such as the participants
in R3, who together listed identity theft, catﬁshing, being
taken advantage of by a trafﬁcker, and having their locations
tracked through the use of various apps on their phones: “the
internet has beneﬁts as well as risks” (R3a). We further discuss
perceived threats like these in Section V-C5.
Culture: Exploiting Barriers. Our interviews surfaced the
fact that refugees’ lack of awareness of risks, and their de-
pendence on assistance, make them particularly vulnerable to
scams. For example, we heard anecdotes about scam websites
and phone calls asking for information for a (fake) low-
income housing application, ads for (fake) minimum-wage
jobs, (scam) phone calls about utility bills being overdue or
arrest warrants, or tax scams around tax day (T2, T3, T4,
CM4). Refugees — particularly recent arrivals — are only just
learning the US bureaucratic processes, as they do not have
experience living in the US, paying US taxes, or applying for
jobs in the US, and hence can have a particularly difﬁcult
job distinguishing a legitimate request from a fake request.
Indeed, T5 observed that when someone calls a new refugee
on the phone, and speaks to them in English, they assume that
1In this case, CM4 — not a technical expert — used the term “computer
hacking” generically to include attackers like scammers.
the person must be someone of authority who is there to help
them.
Culture: Secrecy and Sharing of Information. Case man-
agers and teachers said that refugees from some areas, particu-
larly more rural areas, have a different set of personal informa-
tion, and may share that information more or less freely than
is commonly expected in US culture. For example, in some
cultures birthdays are not awarded the same signiﬁcance they
are in mainstream US, so when refugees arrive from these
cultures and do not know their actual date of birth, they are
assigned a birthday of January 1. Even with refugees whose
children do have ofﬁcially documented birthdays, the parents
may have difﬁculty remembering the precise day: “You know,
when they come here, the last thing they want is to remember
. . . if you have, especially seven, eight kids, to remember, each
one of them, the day the month and the year. ‘Cause you
worried about getting them housing, and you worried about
food stamp doesn’t get cut, worried about getting the work,
and just standing on your feet. The last thing you want to
know is who was born in July, who was born in December.”
Security mechanisms that rely on a high-entropy distribution
of birthdays will not be as secure for refugees from these cul-
tures (i.e., East Africa, but not Syria); relatedly, other security
mechanisms or common password generation algorithms may
use other information, such as the personal information of
close family members, which may be shared to a different
set of people. R3a, from Somalia, expressed concern that
matching birthdays and other information like name with
someone else could cause issues: “You will ﬁnd someone with
the exact same birthdate, name, whatever, the only difference
is the address. And maybe this person did something . . . and
now . . . [the government] just hold your identity on hold, and
maybe travel, like traveling out of the country, and someone
with same information as you has been ﬂagged to travel out of
the country . . . And if you need to cross the border, to another
country, that name is going to pop out because it is ﬂagged.
And you matched with them so you’re going to have to go
through the questions to identify if this is the ofﬁcial person
or not.”
Technical: Lack of Experience. As Section V-A1 observed,
refugees can have varying degrees of experience — some have
had prior technology experience, whereas other do not have
experience with computers or keyboards. And, as noted above,
email is a new concept to many refugees, even those with prior
technical experience. When encountering a new technology,
refugees naturally focus on the primary goal of trying to learn
how to use that technology to accomplish a task (e.g., read
email, or use YouTube to learn English), rather than how to
use it securely and privately.
C. Refugee Security Practices
We now turn to our analysis of the security and privacy
practices that refugees have. One salient observation we have
is that computer security is not a priority for refugees, due to a
combination of the barriers they face: for example, if initially
415

they do not know about scamming, they do not prioritize
securing themselves and their assets against scammers. But,
even when they are well aware of scamming as a threat, they
may not be able to prioritize security against scammers, for
multiple reasons: (1) even if they want to prioritize security
goals, they may not have the technical knowledge to do so, and
(2) other goals under the umbrella of establishing their lives
in the US, such as going to appointments or getting jobs, may
take priority over security.
1) ONLINE AUTHENTICATION
We ﬁnd that refugees face signiﬁcant hurdles with online
authentication. These challenges cause them to rely on their
case managers and teachers for help with account creation
and access, particularly in the case of email accounts (which
refugees need in order to obtain many jobs). Broadly, these
challenges indicate that
text-based passwords and security
questions do not allow refugees’ accounts strong security
because of the barriers that refugees face in implementing
them.
While case managers and teachers focused their discussions
on email account creation and access, since that fell under the
scope of their jobs, many of the issues raised below apply to
authentication in general.
Password Creation. One initial challenge refugees encounter
when trying to create email accounts — and likely other ac-
counts as well — is password creation. There are two key
challenges with password creation for refugees: the privacy
of passwords and the entropy of passwords.
For email accounts, case managers frequently help create
usernames and passwords for their clients. In doing so, some
case managers rely on password creation strategies that scale
for their purposes but are “not. . . unguessable” (T2), including
simple algorithms based on personal information about the
client (for some case managers) as well as the same password
for all their clients (for other case managers).
While there are natural security concerns with having
someone else pick passwords for refugees, T3 also expressed
concern about refugees picking their own passwords: “They
need to be a little more careful of passwords. . . if they don’t
do that very generic password [set by their case manager],
they will pick their child’s name, the year they were born,
something like that, that they can remember easily.” Indeed,
this practice is conﬁrmed by R1a, when discussing how to
pick a password: “As much as I know, lots of people use their
birthdays, but it doesn’t mean they put it in a proper way. They
put the birthday, but they make some changes in it. Maybe we
add a star or a zero or something extra.”
Password Memory. Case managers and teachers commonly
identiﬁed forgotten passwords as an issue (T1, T2, T3, T4,
CM1, CM2, CM3, CM5, R1a). CM3 attributed this partly to a
cultural and language barrier: “So, the last thing they want to
remember is numbers, passwords, usernames, all this new to
them. And add to that, is a different language. So it’s a really
a challenge.” Typically, the case manager or teacher helps the
client recover the password, either by setting a new one, or, in
some cases, by logging in with the real password that the case
manager or teacher has saved. In extreme cases, clients lose
access to their email accounts permanently if they forget the
password, recovery phone number, recovery email address, or
security question answers (T4).
Password Entry. Even when refugees know and remember
their own passwords and security question answers, typing
them correctly can present difﬁculties for refugees with limited
prior experience with computers (CM2, CM5, T2, T3, T4).
T3 said that capitalizing letters, i.e., with the shift or caps
lock key, is sometimes difﬁcult, especially if the password
