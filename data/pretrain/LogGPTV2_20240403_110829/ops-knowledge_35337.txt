User: I wanted to update my python 2.6.1 to 3.x on mac but i was wondering if its possible to do it using terminal or i have to download the installer from python website? 
The reason why i am asking this question is because installer is not updating my terminal python version.
Assistant: Sometimes when you install Python from the install wizard on MAC it will not link to your bash profile. Since you are using homebrew, just to brew install python This would install the latest version of Python and then to link them brew link python@3.9
