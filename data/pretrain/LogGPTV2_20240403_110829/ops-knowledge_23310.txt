User: say I'm running an exe from a python script using:
subprocess.call(cmdArgs,stdout=outf, stderr=errf)
when outf and errf are file descriptors of text files.
is there any way I can generate on top of it a merged and synced text file of both stdout and stderr? 
it should be formatted with time and source(our/err).
thanks
Assistant: You can merge them passing subprocess.STDOUT as the stderr argument for subprocess.Popen, but I don't know if they will be formatted with time and source.
