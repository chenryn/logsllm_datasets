7 CONCLUSION
We challenge the community’s common use of a generic distance-
based utility loss metric and argue for the need of LBS-tailored
utility loss metrics for the LPPM design and evaluation. Motivated
by the lack of real-world data, we build an extensible RHS emulator

A COMPREHENSIVE QL FRAMEWORK
Here, we detail the framework for comprehensive QL, (cid:102)QL, and
demonstrate its effects on remapping for POI search application.
The reason we use POI search LBS is the availability of a closed
form QL expression required for the remapping proposed in [5].
A.1 Comprehensive QL
In LBSes, QLes incurred and their preferences are highly user de-
pendent; therefore, we consider an LBS with D QL dimensions,
lang=en-US.

ing QLe reduces because the earlier remap considers the user
preferences.
for RHS data synthesis. We thoroughly evaluate the established
LPPMs using the data synthesized by the emulator for the specific
privacy preserving instance of RHS that we define We demonstrate
the implications of using generic versus tailored utility loss metrics
on different aspects of LPPM design process namely, choice of
parameters, comparison, design of utility improvement techniques
and, evaluation. We also demonstrate the need to consider user-
centric combination of utility metrics while employing the state-of-
the-art utility improvement techniques. Our work brings to notice
the inadequacy of the generic metrics and its effects on the LPPM
designs.

A.2 Example scenario: POI search LBS
In this section, we define (cid:102)QL for a POI search application. Eu-

clidean distance as a generic QL,
this section), and count of POIs returned by the LBS as a tailored
ˆQLt (denoted as QLc in rest of this section). QLe captures
QL,
the extra distance one needs to travel, on average, to the final
POI while, QLc captures the difference in the number of POIs re-
turned. QLe is the conventional Euclidean distance between lr
and lo while QLc = COUNT(lo,s )
COUNT(lr ,s ) . Here, COUNT(lr , s) gives the
count of POIs around location lr within search radius of s. Corre-
sponding to the two dimensions, preference tuples are denoted as

A.2.1 Experimental setup. For experiments, we use the Gowalla
dataset [7] which contains 6,442,890 check-ins of 196,591 users. We
implement the COUNT, with search radius s = 400m, by perform-
ing geolocal queries to OpenStreetMap database. We consider the
two QL dimensions (10), separately, as baselines and compare per-
formances of three remaps: remap using(cid:102)QLe, Re, remap using(cid:102)QLc,
Rc, and remap using comprehensive QL, ˜R. We fix, the obfuscation

is 1000m and dth
Figure 13: Comparing QLc of three remaps. QLc is a ratio
without any unit. POI count at Re-locations is lowest while
POI count at Rc-locations are highest with ˜R striking a bal-
ance. Note that, QLc denotes ratio of counts of POIs at lo and
at lr therefore, high QLc values are desired.
A.2.2 Results and discussion. The optimal remapped locations in
Fig. 11, 13 and 14 are the same for respective remaps but, Fig. 11
and 13 show QLe and QLc, respectively while Fig. 14 shows ((cid:102)QLe +
(cid:102)QLc )5. In Fig. 11 the four boxes per privacy level denote QLe of
locations for four cases: no remap, ˜R, Re and Rc; Fig. 13 and 14,
show the same for the count and comprehensive QLes, respectively.
Fig 11 shows that locations remapped using just QLc dimension
(red boxes), perform poorly along QLe dimension for all privacy
levels, ℓ. For ℓ = 1.4, the median of the distance between lr and
remapped locations is 2.4km for Rc, 0.6km for Re, 1km for no-
remap and 0.8km for ˜R. Similarly, Fig 13 shows that if remapping is
performed using just QLe dimension (blue boxes), the correspond-
ing locations perform poorly along QLc dimension for all ℓs. For
ℓ = 1.4, the ratio of the number of POIs at the remapped location
and at lr is 2.32 for ˜R, 1.28 for Re and 4.23 for Rc. In both cases, the
lowest value of the QL dimension is for the remap that uses the
corresponding QL, but that remapped location’s QL value along the
other dimension is undesirably high. However, ˜R strikes a balance
between two QL dimensions and remaps to locations that are opti-
mal for given user preferences. Fig. 14 shows the sum of two QL
dimension values; we note that ˜R finds locations with the lowest
comprehensive QL and therefore, improves utility of LPPM in a
user-centric way. Finally, we compare the three remaps for different
user preferences for the two dimensions. Fig 15 demonstrates that

are used, the locations with optimal QL vary significantly with the
QL metric used (Fig 11). Finally, using the comprehensive QL for
the remapping can greatly improve QL of LBS in a user-centric
manner and so the user experience (Fig 14,15). We note that de-
vising tailored and robust QL metrics for complex LBSes like RHS
is not a trivial task. However, using advanced machine learning
techniques on data synthesized using emulators such as RHSE can
lead to QL models that are more representative of perceived QL
incurred in the wild; we leave this to the future work.
Figure 14: Comparing (cid:102)QL for Re, Re and ˜R. When user pref-
erences are considered, ˜R outperforms other remaps.
Figure 15: Comparing(cid:102)QL for different pe values: With pe, dif-
ference between ˜R and Re reduces as ˜R considers user prefer-
ences.
increasing preference for QLe from 0.2 to 0.8 decreases the differ-
ence between both means and medians of ˜R and Re while increases
that for the Rc. Note that, the increased variance of comprehensive
QL values of Rc in Fig 15 is due to the uncontrolled nature of the
experiment, the outcomes of which can depend on the density of
POIs in the area around the locations involved.
Results from § 6 and § 6.6 emphasize that un-tailored and incom-
plete QLes can lead to an incorrect perception of the privacy-utility
trade-off. That is, though the privacy guarantees of an LPPM are
as expected, QLg claims utility that is not necessarily guaranteed.
