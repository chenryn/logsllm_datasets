ATT&CK ID:T1583.008
ATT&CK Technique Name:Malvertising
Adversaries may purchase online advertisements that can be abused to distribute malware to victims. Ads can be purchased to plant as well as favorably position artifacts in specific locations  online, such as prominently placed within search engine results. These ads may make it more difficult for users to distinguish between actual search results and advertisements. Purchased ads may also target specific audiences using the advertising networkâ€™s capabilities, potentially further taking advantage of the trust inherently given to search engines and popular websites.
