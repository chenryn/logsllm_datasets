BUG : Stackoverflow Link
**What is the current behavior?**  
It gives both eval and Function contructor which is not required
    try {
        // This works if eval is allowed (see CSP)
        g = g || Function("return this")() || (1,eval)("this");
    } catch(e) {
        // This works if the window reference is available
        if(typeof window === "object")
            g = window;
    }
    // Another method of build 
    function setImmediate(callback) {
          // Callback can either be a function or a string
          if (typeof callback !== "function") {
            callback = new Function("" + callback);
          }
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
    $ npm install -g vue-cli
    $ vue init webpack-simple my-project
    $ cd my-project
    $ npm install
    $ npm run prod
    You can see in `build.js` having eval 
**What is the expected behavior?**  
I expect that webpack should provide provision to build according to CSP
policy as I am using runtime vue which does not even require compiler.
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**
Node.js : 9.5.0
Tried it with latest config too.
