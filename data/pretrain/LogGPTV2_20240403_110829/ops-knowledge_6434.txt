User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Should I be concerned if the "FBI" has logged onto my Ubuntu VPS? Yesterday, I was performing a bit of general maintenance on a VPS of mine, using the IPMI console my host provided.

Upon setting up SSH keys again via the IPMI console, I logged in via SSH and was shocked to see this:

Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 2.6.32-042stab116.2 x86_64)
Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
Last login: Sat Sep 17 04:39:57 2016 from ic.fbi.gov


Immediately, I contacted my hosting company. They said that they didn't know why this might be, and that it's possible the hostname was spoofed. 

I did a bit more digging, and resolved ic.fbi.gov to an IP address.

I then ran this on the system:

last -i


This returned my IP address, and then two other IP addresses which were unknown to me. I geoIP'd these two IP addresses. One of them was a VPN and the other was a server from a hosting company in the state of Washington.

Again, the IP that I resolved ic.fbi.gov to was not on the list.

Do you think I should be concerned/worried about the "FBI" obtaining access to my VPS? Or is it just a hacker that spoofed the hostname?

Assistant: An IP address can be set up in DNS to resolve to any host name, by whoever is in control of that IP address.

For example, if I am in control of the netblock 203.0.113.128/28, then I can set up 203.0.113.130 to reverse-resolve to presidential-desktop.oval-office.whitehouse.gov. I don't need control of whitehouse.gov to do this, though it can help in some situations (particularly, with any software that checks to make sure reverse and forward resolution matches). That wouldn't mean that the president of the United States logged into your VPS.

If someone has access to your system, they can change the resolver configuration which will effectively enable them to resolve any name to any IP address, or any IP address to any name. (If they have that level of access, they can wreak all kinds of other havoc with your system as well.)

Unless and until you verify that the IP address that was used to log in actually is registered to the FBI, don't worry about the host name being one under fbi.gov. That name mapping may very well be faked. Worry instead that there has been a successful login to your account that you cannot explain, from an IP address that you don't recognize.

Chances are that if the FBI wanted the data on your VPS, they would use a somewhat less obvious approach to get it.

You should worry, but not about the fbi.gov hostname.
