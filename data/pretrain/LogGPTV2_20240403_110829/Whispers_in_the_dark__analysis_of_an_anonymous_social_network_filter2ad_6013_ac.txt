### Capturing User Interactions Using the Graph

To capture user interactions, we weigh the edges of the graph based on the number of interactions between the two nodes. Our analysis focuses on the largest weakly connected component, which encompasses 99% of all nodes. Applying the Louvain method to this component yields an average modularity of 0.4902 for Whisper. In practice, a modularity score greater than 0.3 indicates significant community structure in a graph [24]. We validate our results using the Wakita community detection algorithm, which produces a modularity of 0.409, also above the 0.3 threshold. For reference, the modularity scores of existing social graphs are as follows: Facebook (0.63), YouTube (0.66), and Orkut (0.67) [24]. The relatively low modularity in Whisper aligns with other observations, such as low clustering activities and weak ties.

### User Communities vs. Geolocation

A natural follow-up question is why any communities exist in Whisper at all. If user interactions were random, one would expect uniform interaction patterns. Our hypothesis is that the "nearby" functionality in Whisper, which allows users to browse and likely reply to whispers from people in nearby areas, drives these interactions. This feature encourages users to interact more frequently with others in the same geographic locale, thus fostering geographically driven communities in the interaction graph.

To test this hypothesis, we examine the most prevalent geographic regions for users in each community. If geography is a key factor in forming communities, then each community should be dominated by users from the same or adjacent regions. Table 2 shows the top 5 Whisper communities generated by the Louvain method and their corresponding top regions, using state or province-level location tags. We find that the majority of users in these communities are indeed skewed toward a single region or several geographically adjacent regions (e.g., NY, NJ, and CT for Community C1).

To quantify this phenomenon across all communities, we plot the fraction of users in the top four geographic regions per community in Figure 8. The Louvain method produces 912 communities of varying sizes, and we consider only the largest 150 communities, which together cover over 90% of users. The results confirm our hypothesis: community membership is dominated by the top one or two regions. This strong geographic locality in interactions confirms that the "nearby" stream plays a crucial role in the formation of Whisper communities. While other factors, such as shared topics and interests or time zones, may also contribute to community formation, we leave their analysis for future work.

### User Interactions and Strong Ties

Finally, we analyze user interactions and implicit social links at the individual user level. Given that Whisper lacks persistent identities and social links, users are encouraged to interact with strangers. We seek answers to two key questions: First, do users have a fixed set of "friends" they frequently interact with, despite the anonymous nature of Whisper nicknames? Second, how likely are any strong ties the result of offline friendships?

#### Per-User Interaction

We search for potential friendships (i.e., strong ties) by identifying pairs of users who interact more frequently with each other than with others. We define the set of people a user interacts with, regardless of direction, as her acquaintances. For each user, we compute the distribution of interactions across her top acquaintances and look for skew in her interactions with all acquaintances. We select several points (50th, 70th, and 90th percentiles) from each user’s distribution and aggregate them in a cumulative distribution function (CDF) to show the percentage of top acquaintances involved (Figure 9). To avoid statistical outliers, we only include users with at least 10 interactions.

Our findings indicate that user interactions are distributed fairly evenly across acquaintances. For example, the 90th percentile line shows that for nearly 90% of users, more than 70% of their acquaintances are responsible for 90% of their interactions. This relatively low skew in Whisper is the opposite of traditional online social networks like Facebook, where a small fraction of friends (strong ties) account for the majority of a user's interactions [39].

#### Interaction Across Whispers

We also examine potential strong ties among a user’s acquaintances, specifically those with whom the user interacts often. Figure 10 shows the number of total acquaintances, acquaintances with whom users interacted more than once, and acquaintances with whom users interact more than once using multiple whisper threads. In Whisper, it is common for people to interact more than once under the same whisper, but it is rare to talk with the same person across different whispers due to the difficulty of tracking a particular user via their anonymous nickname. As shown in Figure 10, only 13% of users have acquaintances they interact with across whispers.

For further analysis, we select user pairs who have interacted across whispers. There are 503,000 such user pairs. Figure 11 presents a heat map of these user pairs' lifespan (the timespan between their first and last interaction) and their number of interactions across whispers. The color palette is log-scaled, indicating that the vast majority of user pairs have short-lived, low-interaction relationships. Only a very small fraction of outliers (top right corner) achieve long-term and frequent interactions.

#### Friends or Random Encounters?

Even though strong ties are outliers, it is interesting to explore how these user pairs consistently interact with each other across whispers. Are these pairs of offline friends who actively track each other in public feeds using nicknames, or are they simply users who frequently bump into each other by chance? Deterministically answering this question is challenging, but we have a key intuition: if these interactions are truly random, it is highly likely that the two users are co-located in the same geographic area, particularly in areas with a sparse population of Whisper users. As long as both users actively post whispers, they have a good chance of seeing each other in the nearby list.

To test this intuition, we use our data to examine the geographic distances between user pairs with cross-whisper interactions. We find that among the 503,000 user pairs, 90% have both users co-located in the same state, and 75% have a distance of less than 10 miles. Figures 12, 13, and 14 provide further insights into the relationship between geographic distance, user population in nearby areas, and the number of interactions.

In summary, our analysis reveals that geographic proximity plays a significant role in the formation of communities and strong ties in Whisper. While other factors may also contribute, the "nearby" feature is a key driver of user interactions and community formation.
