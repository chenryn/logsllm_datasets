To capture user interactions using the graph, we weigh graph
edges based on the number of interactions between the two nodes.
Also we focus this analysis on the biggest weakly connected com-
ponent, which contains 99% of all nodes. Applying Louvain pro-
duces average modularity of communities of 0.4902 for Whisper.
In practice, modularity > 0.3 indicates signiﬁcant community struc-
ture in a graph [24]. We conﬁrm our results using the Wakita
community detection algorithm, and ﬁnd a resulting modularity of
0.409 (also above 0.3). As a point of reference, modularity scores
of existing social graphs include Facebook (0.63), Youtube (0.66)
and Orkut (0.67) [24]. Not surprisingly, the relatively weak com-
munities in Whisper match other observations including low clus-
tering activities and weak ties.
User Communities vs. Geolocation.
The natural followup
question is, why are there any communities in Whisper at all? If
user interactions are random, then shouldn’t all interactions be uni-
form? Our hypothesis is that this is due to the “nearby” functional-
ity in Whisper, which allows users to browse (and likely reply to)
whispers posted by people in nearby areas. Our intuition is that
the nearby stream drives users to interact more often with others

in the same geographic locale, thus helping geographically driven
communities form in the interaction graph.
To test this idea, we examine the most prevalent geographic re-
gions for users in each community. If geo-factor is the key driving
force to form communities, then the community should be domi-
nated by users from the same location. Table 2 shows the top 5
Whisper communities generated by Louvain and their correspond-
ing top regions. Here we use “state” or “province” level location
tags. We ﬁnd that the top 5 communities all conﬁrm this: the major-
ity of users are skewed to a single region or several geographically
adjacent regions (e.g. NY, NJ and CT for C1).
To quantify this phenomenon across all communities, we plot in
Figure 8 the fraction of users in the top four geographic regions
per community. Louvain produces 912 communities with varying
sizes, and we only consider the largest 150 communities which to-
gether cover >90% of users. Again the results conﬁrm our hypoth-
esis, community membership is dominated by the top region or top
2 regions. This strong geographic locality in interactions conﬁrms
that the “nearby” stream plays an important role in the formation
of Whisper communities. While other factors may contribute to
the formation of user communities (e.g., users’ shared topics and
interests, time zones), we leave their analysis to future work.
4.3 User Interactions and Strong Ties
Finally, we analyze user interactions and implicit social links at
the per-user level. Recall that Whisper’s lack of persistent identities
and social links encourages users to interact with strangers. In the
following, we seek the answers to two key questions. First, do
users have a ﬁxed set of “friends” that they frequently interact with?
Such friendships could have formed despite the anonymous nature
of Whisper nicknames. Second, how likely are any strong ties the
result of ofﬂine friendships?
Per-user Interaction. We search for potential friendships (i.e.
strong ties) by looking for pairs of users who interact more fre-
quently with each other than with others. For convenience, we call
the set of people that a user interacts with (regardless of direction)
as her acquaintances. For each user, we compute a distribution of
her interactions across her top acquaintances, and look for skew in
her interactions with all acquaintances. We select several points
(50-, 70- and 90-percentiles) from each user’s distribution and ag-
gregate them in a CDF to show the percentage of top acquaintances
involved (Figure 9). To avoid statistical outliers, we only include
users with at least 10 interactions.
We ﬁnd user’s interactions are distributed rather evenly across
acquaintances. Take the 90-percentile line for example, for nearly
all the users (∼90%), more than 70% of their acquaintances are re-
sponsible for 90% of their interactions. This relatively low skew in
Whisper is exactly the opposite of traditional OSNs like Facebook,
where a small fraction of friends (strong ties) are responsible for
the vast majority of user’s interactions [39].
Interaction across Whispers.
Across a user’s acquaintances,
we look for potential strong ties, i.e. acquaintances with whom
the user interacts often. Figure 10 shows user’s number of total
acquaintances, acquaintances that users interacted more than once,
and acquaintances that users interact more than once using multiple
whisper threads. In Whisper, it’s common for people to interact
more than once under the same whisper. However, it’s rare to talk
with the same person across different whispers, because keeping
track of a particular user via their anonymous nickname is difﬁcult.
As shown in Figure 10, only 13% of users have acquaintances that
they interact with across whispers.
We then select those user pairs who have interacted across whis-
pers for further analysis. In total, there are 503K such user-pairs.
Figure 11 presents the heat map of these user-pairs’ lifespan (times-
pan between their ﬁrst and last interaction) and their number of in-
teractions across whispers. Note that the color palette is log-scale—
the vast majority of user pairs are stacked at the left bottom corner,
indicating short-lived, low-interaction relationships. Only a very
small fraction of outliers (right top corner) achieved long-term and
frequent interactions.
Friends or Random Encounters?
Even though the strong ties
are outliers, it is interesting to explore how could these user-pairs
constantly interact with each other across whispers: Are these pairs
of ofﬂine friends who actively track each other in the public feeds
(using nicknames), or are these simply users who bump into each
other often by chance? We realize this is a very hard question to an-
swer deterministically. But we have a key intuition: if these interac-
tions are truly random, then it is highly likely that these two users
are co-located in same geographic area, particularly areas with a
sparse population of Whisper users. Then as long as the two users
actively post whispers, they have a good chance to see each other
in the nearby list.
Now we use our data to test this intuition. For user-pairs with
cross-whisper interactions, we ﬁrst examine their geographic dis-
tances3. We ﬁnd that among 503K user pairs, 90% have two users
co-located in the same “state” and 75% have their distance 10 Inter
