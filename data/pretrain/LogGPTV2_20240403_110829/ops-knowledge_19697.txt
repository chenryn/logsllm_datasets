User: I am trying to run Google's deep dream. For some odd reason I keep getting

ImportError: No module named google.protobuf

after trying to import protobuf. I have installed protobuf using sudo install protobuf. I am running python 2.7 OSX Yosemite 10.10.3.
I think it may be a deployment location issue but i cant find anything on the web about it. Currently deploying to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
Assistant: Locating the google directory in the site-packages directory (for the proper latter directory, of course) and manually creating an (empty) __init__.py resolved this issue for me.
(Note that within this directory is the protobuf directory but my installation of Python 2.7 did not accept the new-style packages so the __init__.py was required, even if empty, to identify the folder as a package folder.)
...In case this helps anyone in the future.
