Configure Basic Settings for SNMPv3
The following example shows the minimum SNMPv3 configuration for enabling Get, GetNext, and Set
operations on a device (note that the configuration has authentication set to md5 and privacy to none):
Enabling SNMPv3 Get, GetNext, and Set Operations
[edit snmp]
v3 {
usm {
local-engine {
user jnpruser {
authentication-md5 {
authentication-key "$9$guaDiQFnAuOQzevMWx7ikqP"; ## SECRET-DATA
}
386
privacy-none;
}
}
}
vacm {

tag tl1;
388
}
notify-filter nf1 {
oid .1 include;
}
}
view all {
oid .1 include;
}
You can convert the SNMPv3 informs to traps by setting the value of the type statement at the [edit snmp
v3 notify N1_all_tl1_informs] hierarchy level to trap as shown in the following example:

Configure SNMP Details
You can use SNMP to store basic administrative details, such as a contact name and the location of the
device. Your management system can then retrieve this information remotely when you are
troubleshooting an issue or performing an audit. In SNMP terminology, these are the sysName,
sysContact, sysDescription, and sysLocation objects found within the system group of MIB-2 (as defined
in RFC 1213, Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-
II). You can set initial values directly in the Junos OS configuration for each system being managed by
SNMP.
389
NOTE: For the devices that are managed by SNMP, always keep the name, location, contact, and
description information configured and updated.
To set the SNMP details:
1. Configure a system name.
Set the system name details by including the name statement at the [edit snmp] hierarchy level.
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set name name
For example:
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set name "host” # Overrides the system name
2. Configure a system contact.
Set the system contact details by including the contact statement at the [edit snmp] hierarchy level, or
in an appropriate configuration group as shown here.
This administrative contact is placed into the MIB II sysContact object.
If the name contains spaces, enclose it in quotation marks (" ").
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set contact contact
For example:
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set contact "Enterprise Support, (650) 555-1234" # Specifies the name and phone
number of the
administrator.
3. Configure a system description.
390
This string is placed into the MIB II sysDescription object. If the description contains spaces, enclose
it in quotation marks (" ").
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set description description
For example:
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set description "M10i router with 8 FPCs" # Specifies the description for the
device.
4. Configure a system location.
This string is placed into the MIB II sysLocation object. If the location contains spaces, enclose it in
quotation marks (" ").
To specify the system location:
[edit]
snmp {
location "Row 11, Rack C";
}
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set location location
For example:
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set location "London Corporate Office, Lab 5, Row 11, Rack C" # Specifies the
location of the device.
5. At the top level of the configuration, apply the configuration group.
If you use a configuration group, you must apply it for it to take effect.
[edit]
user@host# set apply-groups global
391
6. Commit the configuration.
user@host# commit
7. To verify the configuration, enter the show snmp mib walk system operational-mode command.
The show snmp mib walk system command performs a MIB walk through of the system table (from MIB-2
as defined in RFC 1213). The SNMP agent in Junos OS responds by printing each row in the table
and its associated value. You can use the same command to perform a MIB walk through any part of
the MIB tree supported by the agent.
user@host> show snmp mib walk system
sysDescr.0 = M10i router with 8 FPCs
sysObjectID.0 = jnxProductNameM10i
sysUpTime.0 = 173676474
sysContact.0 = Enterprise Support, (650) 555-1234
sysName.0 = host
sysLocation.0 = London Corporate Office, Lab 5, Row 11, Rack C
sysServices.0 = 4
Configure the Commit Delay Timer
When a router or switch first receives an SNMP nonvolatile Set request, a Junos OS XML protocol
session opens and prevents other users or applications from changing the candidate configuration
(equivalent to the command-line interface [CLI] configure exclusive command). If the router receives new
SNMP Set requests while the candidate configuration is being committed, the SNMP Set request is
rejected and an error is generated. If the router receives new SNMP Set requests before 5 seconds have
elapsed, the commit-delay timer (the length of time between when the last SNMP request is received
and the commit is requested) resets to 5 seconds.
By default, the timer is set to 5 seconds. To configure the timer for the SNMP Set reply and start of the
commit, include the commit-delay statement at the [edit snmp nonvolatile] hierarchy level:
[edit snmp nonvolatile]
commit-delay seconds;
seconds is the length of the time between when the SNMP request is received and the commit is
requested for the candidate configuration. For more information about the configure exclusive command
and locking the configuration, see the Junos OS CLI User Guide .
392
Configure SNMP on a Device Running Junos OS
By default, SNMP is disabled on devices running Junos OS. To enable SNMP on a router or switch, you
must include the SNMP configuration statements at the [edit snmp] hierarchy level.
To configure the minimum requirements for SNMP, include community public statement at the [edit snmp]
hierarchy level.
The community defined here as public grants read access to all MIB data to any client.
To configure complete SNMP features, include the following statements at the [edit snmp] hierarchy
level:
snmp {
client-list client-list-name {
ip-addresses;
}
community community-name {
authorization authorization;
client-list-name client-list-name;
clients {

Example: Configure SNMP on the QFabric System
IN THIS SECTION
Requirements | 394
Overview | 395
Configuration | 395
By default, SNMP is disabled on devices running Junos OS. This example describes the steps for
configuring SNMP on the QFabric system.
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• Junos OS Release 12.2
• Network management system (NMS) (running the SNMP manager)
• QFabric system (running the SNMP agent) with multiple Node devices
395
Overview
IN THIS SECTION
Topology | 395
You must enable SNMP on your device by including configuration statements at the [edit snmp] hierarchy
level. At a minimum, you must configure the community public statement. The community defined as public
grants read-only access to MIB data to any client.
If no clients statement is configured, all clients are allowed. We recommend that you always include the
restrict option to limit SNMP client access to the switch.
Topology
The network topology in this example includes an NMS, a QFabric system with four Node devices, and
external SNMP servers that are configured for receiving traps.

Procedure
CLI Quick Configuration
To quickly configure this example, copy the following commands, paste them into a text file, remove any
line breaks, change any details necessary to match your network configuration, and then copy and paste
the commands into the CLI at the [edit] hierarchy level.
set snmp name “snmp qfabric” description “qfabric0 switch”
set snmp location “Lab 4 Row 11” contact “qfabric-admin@qfabric0”
set snmp community public authorization read-only
set snmp client-list list0 192.168.0.0/24
396
set snmp community public client-list-name list0
set snmp community public clients 192.170.0.0/24 restrict
set snmp trap-group “qf-traps” destination-port 155 targets 192.168.0.100
Step-by-Step Procedure
The following example requires that you navigate various levels in the configuration hierarchy. For
instructions on how to do that, see Using the CLI Editor in Configuration Mode in the Junos OS CLI User
Guide .
To configure SNMP on the QFabric system:
NOTE: If the name, description, location, contact, or community name contains spaces, enclose
the text in quotation marks (" ").
1. Configure the SNMP system name:
[edit snmp]
user@switch# set name “snmp qfabric”
NOTE: You can access the above configured SNMP system name:
• By doing a query with the SNMPGet on policy object identifier (OID) sysName.0.
• From the generic jnxSyslogTrap. To send the jnxSyslogTrap, configure the trap events at
[edit event-options policy] hierarchy.
2. Specify a description.
[edit snmp]
user@switch# set description “qfabric0 system”
This string is placed into the MIB II sysDescription object.
397
3. Specify the physical location of the QFabric system.
[edit snmp]
user@switch# set location “Lab 4 Row 11”
