Now `deno check` command provides two options in terms of how many modules
it's going to typecheck.
  * no option: only local modules are typechecked
  * `--all`: all modules including remote are typechecked
This suffices in almost all use cases, but it's going to be complicated if we
want to perform typecheck within the project that vendors external
dependencies using `deno vendor`. Vendored dependencies are considered "local"
so `deno check` will check for vendored ones as well. This is sometimes
troublesome if vendored dependencies have type errors that are known and
acceptable.
So it would be great if we could have a new option, let's say
`--ignore=`, that make the type checker ignore type errors happening
in the specified files. This way, specifying `--ignore=vendor/` will allow us
to ignore vendored dependencies.
