### Network Problem Detection and Analysis

Our edge-based approach has confirmed network problems in nearly 80% of the labeled events. Additionally, it detected 127 unconfirmed events. While these unconfirmed events are not verified, we caution against inferring false positive rates, as they are based on what is detectable from existing monitoring systems. Even if all these events were false, the average false alarm rate (just over 4 events per day) remains manageable.

For a North American Internet Service Provider (ISP), our approach detected various performance events, including confirmed outages. For cases where there was a drop in performance but not an outage, ground truth information was unavailable. Figure 7 illustrates three types of events detected by our approach: (a) a confirmed outage, (b) an unconfirmed non-outage performance event, and (c) an unconfirmed outage. Table 3 summarizes the results for this ISP, showing that our approach detected half of the largest outages (column 3). Column 4 lists the number of outages that affected monitored hosts but did not have sufficient numbers to validate the event. Additionally, our approach detected 41 events during a one-month period, which the ISP could not confirm or deny.

**Definitions:**
- **Outage:** Loss of network connectivity.
- **Non-outage:** Connectivity with significantly reduced performance.

### Event Detection and Coverage

Edge-system event detection requires a sufficient number of peers to concurrently use a network for corroboration. To evaluate the coverage, we calculated the maximum number of peers simultaneously online for each network in our dataset. On average, the number of simultaneous online peers per routable prefix is 3 and per Autonomous System Number (ASN) is 7. Despite our installed base representing less than 0.4% of all BitTorrent clients, we find this provides sufficient coverage (three or more peers concurrently online) for more than half of the ASNs studied.

### Worldwide Events

Our approach, NEWS, effectively detects network events worldwide, using a threshold likelihood ratio (LR) of 2. Over a one-month period, events were detected in 38 countries across five continents, highlighting the broad coverage of edge-based detection. Table 4(a) lists the top 10 ISPs by the number of users and the number of events detected in each ISP. There is little correlation between the number of vantage points in a network and the number of detected performance events.

### Cross-Network Events

A unique advantage of NEWS is its ability to detect network problems affecting multiple ISPs, such as issues with upstream providers or peering links. We focus on events due to upstream provider or peer issues, finding synchronized events in multiple ASes. Events within 30 minutes of each other are considered the same, and AS relationships are only considered for ASes in the same country. Table 5 summarizes the results, showing 370 cases in five countries for at least two ASNs with the same provider. Table 6 provides examples of cross-network events.

### Robustness

The likelihood ratio (LR) can be seen as a parameter for distilling network events from locally detected data. Figure 8 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of simultaneous online peers for each routable prefix and ASN, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.

By providing a detailed and structured analysis, we aim to ensure that the deployment of our approach reports events at a reasonable rate, avoiding overwhelming network operators and users.
