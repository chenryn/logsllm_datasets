predict the ally jamming signals in the following received
samples, and then subtract
them out from the received
samples to check how much ally jamming power remains.
the percentage of jamming power
removed by the authorized receiver depends on how many
ally jamming samples we need to the estimate. Intuitively, as
channel changes over time, if we apply the same estimated
channel coefﬁcients to estimate too many samples,
the
quality of estimation will degrade, and less jamming power
will be removed. Figure 14 shows that the authorized device
can remove 99.2% to 99.6% ally jamming power when the
length of the estimated samples increases from 1, 000 to
14, 000. In other words, the vast majority of the ally jamming
signal power can be effectively removed.

recovers the transmitted signals, and then streams them
into the demodulation blocks. In contrast, the unauthorized
receiver demodulates the received samples directly.

(b) Packet Loss Rate
Figure 15. Macro-evaluation.
Figure 15 (a) shows the BER for both authorized and
unauthorized devices.
It can be seen that as the JSR
increases, the BER of the unauthorized receiver quickly
increases to about 50%, a value achievable with random
guesses. In contrast, with the ally jamming signals removal
techniques, the authorized receiver can maintain close to 0
BER until the JSR exceeds 17dB. We use the GNURadio
benchmark receiver to evaluate the overall packet loss rate.
Figure 15 (b) shows the packet loss rates for both authorized
and unauthorized receivers. Again, when the JSR increases,
the packet loss rate at the unauthorized receiver quickly
reaches 100%, while the packet loss rate at the authorized
one remains close to 0 until the JSR reaches 16 dB. Unau-
thorized devices can certainly try to use Error Correction
Code (ECC) to tolerate errors. However, with close to 50%
BER, it is unlikely to reduce the packet loss rate much.
We also perform some preliminary evaluation of ally
friendly jamming against unauthorized devices that are
equipped with DSSS-based anti-jamming capability. In this
experiment, we use IEEE 802.11b protocol running at 1
Mbps on unauthorized devices, which uses DSSS with an
11-bit barker code for spreading and despreading [29].
More speciﬁcally, we use two laptops with 802.11b wire-
less adapters operating at the DSSS mode as unauthorized
devices. We use another laptop connected to a USRP N210
board as the ally jammer. All these three devices are about
2 meters away from each other. We set the USRP using
2.452GHz frequency and the 802.11b wireless adapters
using the same frequency (i.e., channel 9). We adjust the
ally jammer’s gain to make sure it has the same transmit
power with the 802.11b transmitter. We test the packet loss
rate at the 802.11b receiver side when different jamming
symbol rates are used. (Note that higher symbol rates will

cover wider spectrum.) Figure 16 shows that when the
symbol rate for the ally jammer is more than 600ksps,
the communication between these 802.11b DSSS devices
is disabled.
Note that though 802.11b DSSS mode is designed for
wireless communication under interference, it is not intended
as a strong anti-jamming solution. More in-depth evalu-
ation is necessary to understand the performance of ally
friendly jamming against powerful anti-jamming communi-
cation schemes.
VII. RELATED WORK
IMD Shield [12] is the most closely related work to ours.
As discussed in the introduction, IMD Shield cannot achieve
ally friendly jamming. We do not repeat it here.
Our work in this paper is in general related to research on
interference cancellation and suppression. Zigzag recursively
applies interference cancellation to get the interference free
signals from colliding ones [13]. Another Interference Align-
ment and Cancellation (IAC) technique was proposed to
enable collaborative Access Points (APs) in MIMO LANs
to decode more packets by controlling transmitted signals
with proper vectors [14]. 802.11n+ was proposed to use
“antidote” signals to nullify the transmitted signals from
other nodes in order to enable multiple access to wireless
channels [19]. An implementation of successive interference
cancellation (SIC) for ZigBee on software radios was pre-
sented in [15] which can decode concurrently transmitted
packets. Moreover, SAM [41] provides a chain-decoding
technique to decode concurrent frames. All these techniques
assume regular modulated signals are transmitted and per-
form interference cancellation accordingly. Unfortunately,
when the ally jamming signals mimic random noises, none
of them can be used due to the challenges in synchronization
and channel estimation. Our proposed techniques have ad-
dressed these issues and advanced interference cancellation
techniques to the next level.
Ally friendly jamming is also related to wireless jamming
and anti-jamming research. For friendly jamming studies,
Sankararaman et al. studied strategies of allocating friendly

jammers to create wireless barriers which can prevent the
eavesdropping [36]. There are also other literature (e.g., [27],
[35], [44]) using friendly jamming to block the responses or
unauthorized queries to protect particular wireless devices.
For jamming and anti-jamming techniques, jamming attack
models and several ways to detect jamming attacks have
been studied in [45]. Game theoretical models have been
developed for jamming and jamming defense [37], [46].
Spread spectrum techniques such as DSSS and FHSS have
been traditionally used for anti-jamming wireless commu-
nication. In recent years, researchers have identiﬁed some
weaknesses of such schemes due to shared keys and devel-
oped enhanced schemes, including Uncoordinated FHSS and
its variations (e.g., [20], [38]–[40]), Uncoordinated DSSS
and its variations (e.g., [21], [24], [32], [33]), and novel
coding techniques (e.g., [5], [42]). Several ﬁlter designing
jamming mitigation techniques have also been proposed [8],
[9]. All these works are complementary to our results in this
paper.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented ally friendly jamming, a mech-
anism that jams unauthorized wireless communication and
maintains legitimate communication at the same time. Ally
friendly jamming is achieved by properly controlling the ally
jamming signals using secret keys shared among authorized
devices and the ally jammers. We have analyzed the prop-
erties of ally friendly jamming, implemented a prototype
system, and performed a series of experimental evaluation.
Our results demonstrated that the proposed techniques can
effectively disable unauthorized wireless communication and
at the same time allow wireless communication between
authorized devices.
Our future work includes enhancing the robustness of the
ally friendly jamming technique, investigating its capability
against unauthorized anti-jamming devices and defending
against adversarial jamming attacks.
