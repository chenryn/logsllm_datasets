ATT&CK Technique Name:Disable or Remove Feature or Program
Follow Office macro security best practices suitable for your environment. Disable Office VBA macros from executing.Disable Office add-ins. If they are required, follow best practices for securing them by requiring them to be signed and disabling user notification for allowing add-ins. For some add-ins types (WLL, VBA) additional mitigation is likely required as disabling add-ins in the Office Trust Center does not disable WLL nor does it prevent VBA code from executing. [7]
