**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Disable or Remove Feature or Program

To mitigate the risk of malicious Office macros, it is essential to follow best practices for macro security that are appropriate for your environment. Specifically, you should:

1. **Disable Office VBA Macros:** Prevent VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros from executing. This can be done through Group Policy settings or by configuring the Trust Center in Office applications.

2. **Disable Office Add-ins:** If possible, disable Office add-ins. If certain add-ins are necessary, ensure they are signed and trusted. Additionally, disable user notifications that prompt for permission to allow add-ins to run.

3. **Additional Mitigation for Specific Add-in Types:**
   - **WLL (Word Loading Library) Add-ins:** Disabling add-ins in the Office Trust Center does not affect WLL add-ins. Therefore, additional measures may be required to mitigate the risks associated with WLL add-ins.
   - **VBA Code Execution:** Disabling add-ins in the Trust Center does not prevent VBA code from running. Ensure that VBA macros are disabled as described in the first step.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of attacks that exploit Office features and programs. For more detailed guidance, refer to the official Microsoft documentation on securing Office applications.
