To extract the pattern "Processor ANSI SCSI revision: 02" from the log, you can use the following regular expression:

```
Processor ANSI SCSI revision: 02
```

If you need to match any revision number (not just "02"), you can use a more general pattern:

```
Processor ANSI SCSI revision: \d{2}
```

This regular expression will match "Processor ANSI SCSI revision:" followed by any two-digit number.
