• Admin/Root, SCADA PLC
Green Team
• Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI)
• Linköping, Sweden
• Hosted most CDX infrastructure
• 9 racks, 20 physical servers each
• BT nets designed by GT & WT

• Each:1 butane flame to “detonate”
• RT / BTs accessed game via OpenVPN
Blue Teams
• 6 BTs
• 6-10 personnel each
• Northern Euro gov, mil, priv sec, academia
• Network: identical, pre-built, fairly insecure
• 20 physical PC servers, 28 virtual machines
• 4 VLAN segments: DMZ, INTERNAL, HMI, PLC
• Many elements unpatched, vuln, misconfig, poor 
paswrds, keys, some pre-planted malware

UNCLASSIFIED
BCS SCADA
• Sim: power generation company
–Production, management, distribution
–GE PLCs
–Cimplicity HMI terminals
–Historian databases
• 2 model factories per BT net
Model Factories
Model Steam Engine
GE PLC
Hardening the Network
• BTs did not have prior access to CDX 
environment
• Given somewhat outdated network docs
• Could install / modify existing SW
• Min #, type of apps & services required
• Offensive BT cyber attacks prohibited
• Vs RT or other BTs
Red Team
• 20 volunteer angry environmntlst h4x0r5
– Attacks should begin slowly, intensify
– No limit on hacker tools & techniques vs BTs
– Could not attack CDX infrastructure
– Attacks confined to CDX environment
• Internally, four sub-teams
– “Client-side,” “fuzzing,” “web app,” “remote”
• Early CDX access, sim prior recon
Visualization
• Network topography
• Traffic flows
• Chat channels
• Team workspaces
• Observer reports
• Terrestrial map
• Scoreboard
UNCLASSIFIED
RT Campaign
• Four phases
1. Declaration of war
2. Breaching the castle wall
3. Owning the infrastructure
4. Wanton destruction
Declaration of War
• Hacker ultimatum
– RT must deface each BT website
– “Cease operations & convert to green power…”
• “…or face crippling cyber attack!”
– Extremist environmental organization
• “K3 c1b3r w4rf4r3 d1v1s10n”
– RT defaced 5 of 6 sites w/in 30 minutes
Phase One
• WT allowed RT to compromise only:
– 1 server in each BT DMZ
– 1 INTERNAL workstation
• Still, RT created steady stream of incident
reports
• EX: in 1 hour, RT had live A/V feed from BT 
workspace
• WT had trouble scoring all incidents
Phase Two
• RT: compr as many DMZ / INTERNAL as possible
– First day: 42 kills, incl web, email servers
– MS-SQL SCADA rept server
• Historical CDX challenge
– Balanced, sustained RT pressure on all BTs
– WT directive: for each vuln, all BT sys checked
• For Red Team, was BCS config too easy?
– Maybe not: 2 BTs kept RT out of INTERNAL nets
Phase Three
• Steal BT “crown jewels”
–Human Machine Interface (HMI)
• Power managment
• SCADA infrastructure
• RT claimed only limited victories
–Only 1 of 12 model factories set on fire
• Intentional or accidental?
1300Z: Boom!
diff: RT vs State Actor
• RT did not understand factory processes
• How to blow them up?
• Hypothesis
• The one factory blown up was due to fuzzing
attack vs Modbus protocol
• More RT / GT communication, training could
help
Phase Four
• “Wanton destruction”
• Attack / destroy any BT system
• Desperate attempt to cause max taret dmg
• Not a wise CDX decision
• RT DoS’d previously conquered systems
• EX: Custom-config Cisco router DoS
• Prevented WT from accurately scoring game
Vulns and Exploits
• RT compromised 80 BT computers
• Publicly-known vulns
• MS03-026, MS04-011, MS06-040, MS08-067, MS10-
025, flaws in VNC, Icecast, ClamAV, SQUID3
• Hacked web applications
• Joomla and Wordpress
• SQL injection, local / remote file inclusion, path
traversal, XSS vs Linux / Apache / Mysql / PHP
Vulns and Exploits 2
• Account cracking, online brute-forcing, DoS with
fuzzing tools, password hash dumps, “pass-the-
hash,” Slowloris vs Apache, NTP daemon and Squid3 
web proxy DoS, SYN flood
• Backdoors: poison ivy, Zeus, Optix, netcat, custom-
made code; Metasploit used to deploy reverse 
backdoors
• Crontab changes: eg, drop firewall rules
• One zero-day client-side exploit for most browsers
And the Winner is…
• Essential services moved to custom-built, higher-
security virtual machine
– NTP, DNS, SMTP, WebMail
• Domain Controller: IPsec filtering
• “Out-of-band” communications
– Did not trust in-game e-mail
• Preexisting malware found and disabled
• After initial MS-SQL loss, no Conf/Integ points lost
Successful BT Strategies
• Linux
– AppArmor, Samhain, custom short shell scripts
• Windows
– AD group policies, CIS SE46 Computer Integrity 
System, KernelGuard, central collection of logs
• All OSs
– White/blacklisting, IP blocking/black hole routing
Goals Met? 1
1. Successful “live fire” CDX
–
BTs tasted defense of CII / SCADA
–
“Cyber terrorist” scenario explored
–
Very little down-time reported
2. International composition of teams
–
>100 personnel, >7 countries
–
Numerous cross-border relationships
strengthened
Lessons
•
More WT manpower
–
Coms, scoring, observation, adjudication
–
1 WT per BT, 2 WT for RT (trust issues)
•
One pre-CDX “mechanics” day
–
Strength-test all connectivity, bandwidth
–
Make rules and scoring crystal clear
•
“Dumb users” req’d or no client-side attacks
–
Wasted browser 0-day (affected SCADA sim)
Lessons 2
•
No VMWare Server Console
–
Too big, too slow, too particular
•
BTs should have some net admin rights
•
Authoritative team leaders from start
–
Big project = some clashing agendas, egos
•
Lawyer on WT
•
No “wanton destruction” phase
Final Thought
• CDX challenges ≈ real world challenges
• IT
• Complicated, dynamic, polymorphic, evolving
• Defenders may not see same attack twice
• Intangible nature of cyberspace
• Victory, defeat, battle damage can be highly 
subjective
• Sub Rosa Cyber War
