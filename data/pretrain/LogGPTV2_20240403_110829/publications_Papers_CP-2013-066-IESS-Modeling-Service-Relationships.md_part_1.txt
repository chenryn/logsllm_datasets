## Abstract
Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the study of networks across various scientific fields, including sociology, biology, and physical systems such as power grids. However, the field of service networks has received relatively less attention. Previous research has primarily focused on modeling individual service systems and service compositions, often concentrating on temporal relationships between services. This paper aims to propose a computational model to represent the diverse types of relationships that can be established between service systems to model service networks. This work is particularly important as the study of service networks can lead to new scientific discoveries about how service-based economies operate on a global scale.

## 1. Introduction
Many systems around us can be described using network models, which consist of nodes connected by edges. Examples include social networks, the Internet, supply chains, and power grids. The global economy itself is a complex network composed of national economies, which are networks of markets, and markets are networks of providers, brokers, intermediaries, and consumers.

Understanding how service systems evolve as networks and the risks and benefits of different topologies is becoming increasingly critical for society [1]. Vargo et al. [2] and others have observed that society is moving towards a service-dominant system. However, our knowledge of global service networks remains limited. Understanding the dynamics and laws governing service networks can provide valuable insights into why and how financial service systems fail. For example, it can explain how the 2007–2012 global financial crisis propagated through global service networks. It can also provide a scientific basis for engineering efficient and robust service network topologies to withstand adverse environments.

While service markets are ubiquitous, the study of service networks has not received the necessary attention. Research has primarily focused on a technical perspective, modeling single services as software components (e.g., Web services [3]). Business process and workflow management have also explored how services can be composed to form process models by establishing temporal dependencies between services (cf. [4]). The goal of this research was not to model service networks as representations of economic activities but to model the technical interfaces required to integrate information systems in heterogeneous environments.

In [5, 6], we proposed to model service networks by constructing what we call Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSN). These networks are built by accessing, retrieving, and combining information from globally distributed service systems and relationship models. Regarding the modeling of services, we developed a family of languages named *-USDL (the Unified Service Description Language) [7, 8] to provide computer-understandable descriptions for business services. These languages allow the formalization of business services in a way that they can be used effectively, for example, for dynamic service outsourcing and automatic service contract negotiation.

Since our previous work yielded suitable computational models to represent service systems, the objective of this paper is to propose a model to represent the various types of relationships that can exist in a service network. The developed model, called the Open Semantic Service Relationship (OSSR) model, is computer-understandable, represented with semantic Web languages, and defines the main concepts and properties required to establish rich semantic relationships between service models. We believe that the importance and expressiveness of relationships have been overlooked in many fields. Gradde and Snehota [9] also argue that existing studies on relationships in the field of business models often oversimplify business representations. For example, the simple relations used by other modeling initiatives such as Linked Data [10] to interconnect data (using rdfs:subClassOf, owl:EquivalentClass, and owl:sameAs), the relation foaf:knows from FOAF [11] to interconnect people, and the use of rdfs:seeAlso by SIOC [12] to interconnect documents are too restrictive and limited for connecting service systems. Therefore, we developed a multi-layer relationship model that links services via multiple types of connecting perspectives (e.g., participating roles, interconnection level, and involvement strength [13, 14, 15, 9]), capturing the richness, complexity, and characteristics of services. This goes well beyond the connection of service systems treated simply as unidimensional nodes.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present important definitions and illustrate application domains for service networks to serve as motivation scenarios. Section 3 describes the multi-level relationship model developed to connect service systems. Section 4 describes the evaluation and implementation of the model. Section 5 presents related work in this field of research. Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. Definitions and Motivation Scenarios
A service network is defined as a graph structure composed of service systems, which are nodes connected by one or more specific types of service relationships, the edges. A service system is a functional unit with a boundary through which interactions occur with the environment, and, especially, with other service systems. Service networks are similar to social networks in their structure but connect service systems. They differ from process models because they do not emphasize control flow, temporal dependencies, and cases. We illustrate their possible use with two application domains.

### Regulation of Service Markets
The analysis of service networks can detect topological patterns such as oligopolies, monopolies, or 'cartels' in service markets. For example, a power-law distribution pattern can be used to identify oligopolies, as it implies that only a few large service providers exist, while small providers are extremely common. The identification of such network characteristics or anomalies is important for regulatory bodies like the EU, which routinely passes directives for European markets on laws to be followed.

### Supply Chain Management
While supply chain management is crucial for many companies, there is currently no practical and automated solution to analyze global supply-chain networks. The lack of global models only allows for studying these networks from a local, reduced, and naive view (cf. [16]). The development of computational models will give firms a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of supply chain networks at a global scale.

## 3. Multi-layer Relationship Model
When examining previous approaches to model network structures using semantic Web languages, relationships were often overlooked, with the emphasis placed on nodes. For example, the use of simple primitives such as foaf:knows, rdfs:subClassOf, owl:EquivalentClass, rdf:seeAlso, and owl:sameAs to connect people, data, and community-generated documents (cf. [10, 11, 12]) is limited for service networks. It only enables the creation of networks with one homogeneous layer, thus limiting the types of analysis that can be made. The richness of service systems, which involve people, laws, resources, operations, processes, service levels, etc., requires a different approach based on the use of multiple layers to construct service networks. For example, two service systems can be related by describing the roles they can take, representing the strength of the relationship, and establishing a comparison of the set of functionalities provided. This goes well beyond the connection of entities seen simply as unidimensional nodes.

To construct a comprehensive relationship model, we followed an inductive research approach. We conducted a literature review on work describing and discussing the types of relationships that exist in organizations applicable to the field of services. We electronically searched the titles, abstracts, keywords, and full texts of articles in Google Scholar (scholar.google.com), SpringerLink (link.springer.com), Taylor & Francis (www.tandf.co.uk), and Google Books (books.google.com) for the main word string "relationship." The search included several variations of the original term, such as "service relationship," "service systems relationship," "business relationship," or "relationship model." Articles were read to determine their relevance for modeling relationships between service systems.

We identified propositions and generalized them into a theoretical multi-layer relationship model composed of six layers: 1) role, 2) level, 3) involvement, 4) comparison, 5) association, and 6) causality. OSSR comprises a total of 15 top-level concepts: Relationship, Service, Source, Target, Role, Level, Involvement, Comparison, Association, Causality, Cause, Link, Effect, Category, and KPI. The layers are grouped together using the central concept Relationship. One endpoint of the relationship is the service source (Source), and the other is the service target (Target). Both are subclasses of the concept Service, which represents a service system possibly modeled with a language such as Linked-USDL (see §1 and §4).

The layers and concepts are summarized in Table 1, illustrated in Figure 1, and described in the following sections. While the examples given are mainly from the field of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), the model was designed to be applied to services ranging from human-based services to fully automated software-based services.

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Role** [14] | The role of the service systems involved in a relationship. |
| **Level** [15] | The level (e.g., activity, resources, or people) at which a relationship is established. |
| **Involvement** [9] | The strength of a relationship. |
| **Comparison** [17] | The comparison of service systems involved in a relationship. |
| **Association** [18] | An expression of the 'a part of' relation between two service systems. |
| **Causality** [19] | The influence that key performance indicators of one service system have on another service system. |

### 3.1 Participating Roles
Understanding roles is an important aspect of determining the position of a service system in a network. For example, a service can create alliances with complementors to differentiate itself from competition and deliver more value to customers. We rely on the work from Ritter et al. [14] to classify the role of the service systems involved in a relationship into four distinct types captured with the concept Role:

1. **Customer**
2. **Supplier**
3. **Competitor**
4. **Complementor**

A service source that establishes a relationship with a service target with the role of Customer focuses on a good working mode with customers, always keeping in mind the co-creation of value during service provisioning. A relationship with a service target of type Supplier often focuses on a durable stream of competitive advantage, which may be hard for others to imitate or break.

Complementors are the mirror image of competitors. In other words, customers value a service more when complementors exist, whereas they value a service less when competitors exist [20]. A relationship with a target service of type Complementor enables a service source to increase its value by adding external operations to it. A service system \( S_c \) is a complementor if customers value service system \( S_i \) more when they have service \( S_c \) than when they have service \( S_i \) alone. One example is joining a flight transportation service, an accommodation service, and a car rental service, where services cooperate in reaching out to customers in the form of value-added promotions. Finally, a service system can establish a relationship of type Competitor with a service target that belongs to the same market segment.
