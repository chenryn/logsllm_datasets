1 Introduction
Many systems around us can be described by network models, which are struc-
tures consisting of nodes connected by edges. The examples available are nu-
merous and range from social networks, to the Internet, to supply chains, and
to power grids. The global economy is itself a complex network composed of
national economies, which are themselves networks of markets, and markets are
also networks of providers, brokers, intermediaries, and consumers.
Understanding how services systems1 evolve as networks and the risks and
gainsofdifferenttopologiesisbecomingincreasinglycriticalforsociety[1].Vargo
et al. [2], and others, have also perceived that society is moving into a service-
dominant system. Nonetheless, our knowledge on global service networks is lim-
ited. Understanding the dynamics and laws governing service networks can pro-
vide authoritative insights on why and how financial service systems fail. For
example, it can explain how the 2007–2012 global financial crisis propagated

While service markets are ubiquitous, the study of service networks did not
receive the needed attention. Research has been mainly done from a technical
perspective by modeling single services as software components (e.g. Web ser-
vices[3]).Businessprocessandworkflowmanagementhavealsolookedintohow
services can be composed to form process models by establishing temporal de-
pendencies between services (c.f. [4]). The goal of the research conducted was
nottomodelservicenetworksastherepresentationofeconomicactivities,butto
model the technical interfaces that need to be in place to integrate information
systems to operate in heterogeneous environments.
In[5,6]weproposedtomodelservicenetworksbyconstructingwhatwecall
Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSN). These networks are constructed by
accessing, retrieving, and combining information from service systems and rela-
tionship models globally distributed. With respect to the modeling of services,
wehavedevelopedafamilyoflanguagesnamed*-USDL(theUnifiedServiceDe-
scription Language)[7, 8] to provide computer-understandable descriptions for
business services. These languages2,3,4 allow to formalize business services in
such a way that they can be used effectively, for example, for dynamic service
outsourcing and automatic service contract negotiation.
Since our previous work yielded suitable computational models to represent
servicesystems,theobjectiveofthispaperistoproposeamodeltorepresentthe
various types of relationships which can exist in a service network. The model
developed, and called Open Semantic Service Relationship (OSSR) model, is
computer-understandable, is represented with semantic Web languages, and de-
fines the main concepts and properties required to established rich semantic
relationships between service models. We believe that the importance and ex-
pressivenessofrelationshipshasbeenoverlookedinmanyfields.GraddeandSne-
hota[9]alsobelievethatexistingstudiesonrelationshipsinthefieldofbusiness
models usually oversimplify business representations. For example, we consider
that the simple relations used by other modeling initiatives such Linked Data
[10]tointerconnectdata–usingrdfs:subClassOf,owl:EquivalentClass,and
owl:sameAs – the relation foaf:knows from FOAF [11] to interconnect people,
andtheuseof rdfs:seeAlsobySIOC[12]tointerconnectdocumentsarestrict
and limited relationships not suitable to connect service systems. Therefore,
we developed a multi-layer relationship model which links services via multiple
types of connecting perspectives (e.g. participating roles, interconnection level,
and involvement strength [13, 14, 15, 9]) capturing the richness, complexity,
and characteristics of services. This goes well beyond the connection of service
systems treated simply as unidimensional nodes.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present impor-
tant definitions and illustrate application domains for service networks to serve
as motivation scenarios. Section 3 describes the multi-level relationship model
developed to connect service systems. Section 4 describes the evaluation and

research. Section 6 is the conclusion.
2 Definitions and Motivation Scenarios
A service network is defined as a graph structure composed of service systems
which are nodes connected by one or more specific types of service relation-
ship, the edges. A service system is a functional unit with a boundary through
which interactions occur with the environment, and, especially, with other ser-
vice systems. Service networks are similar to social networks in their structure
but connect service systems. They are different from process models since they

illustrate their possible use with two application domains.
Regulation of service markets. Theanalysisofservicenetworkscandetecttopo-
logical patterns such as oligopolies, monopolies, or ’cartels’ in service markets.

characteristics or anomalies are of importance for regulatory bodies such as the
EU which routinely passes directives for European markets on laws to be fol-
lowed.
Supply chain management. Whilesupply-chainmanagementiscrucialformany

supply-chain networks. The inexistence of global models only enables to study
this type of networks from a local, reduced, and na¨ıve view (c.f. [16]). The
development of computational models will give firms a better understanding of
the dynamic behavior of supply chain networks at a global scale.
3 Multi-layer Relationship Model
When examining previous approaches to model network structures by using se-
mantic Web languages, relationships were often overlooked by placing the em-
phasis on nodes. For example, the use of simple primitives such as foaf:knows,
rdfs:subClassOf, owl:EquivalentClass, rdf:seeAlso and owl:sameAs to
connect people, data, and community generated documents (c.f. [10, 11, 12])
is limited for service networks. It only enables to create networks with one ho-
mogeneous layer thus limiting the types of analysis which can be made. The
richness of service systems – which involve people, laws, resources, operations,
processes, service levels, etc. – requires a different approach based on the use of
multiple layers to construct service networks. For example, two service systems

of the relationship, and by establishing a comparison of the set of functionali-
ties provided. This goes well beyond the connection of entities seen simply as
unidimensional nodes.
To construct a comprehensive relationship model, we followed an inductive
research approach. We conducted a literature review on work describing and
discussing the types of relationships which exist in organizations applicable to
the field of services. We electronically searched the titles, abstracts, keywords,
andfulltextsofarticlesinGoogleScholar(scholar.google.com),SpringerLink
(link.springer.com),Taylor&Francis(www.tandf.co.uk),andGoogleBooks
(books.google.com) for the main word string ”relationship”. The search in-
cludedseveralvariationsoftheoriginaltermlike”servicerelationship”,”service
systems relationship”, ”business relationship” or ”relationship model”. Articles
were read to determine there relevance for modeling relationships between ser-
vice systems.
We identified propositions and generalized them in a theoretical multi-layer
relationship model composed of six layers: 1) role, 2) level, 3) involvement, 4)
comparison, 5) association, and 6) causality. OSSR comprises at total of 15 top
level concepts, namely Relationship, Service, Source, Target, Role, Level,
Involvement, Comparison, Association, Causality, Cause, Link, Effect,
Category, and KPI. The layers are grouped together using the central concept
Relationship. One of the endpoints of the relationship is the service source
(Source) and the other one is the service target (Target). Both are subclasses
oftheconceptServicewhichrepresentsaservicesystempossiblymodeledwith
a language such as Linked-USDL (see §1 and §4).
The layers and concepts5 are summarized in Table 1, illustrated in Figure 1,
and described in the following sections. While the examples given are mainly
from the field of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), the model was designed to be
applied to services that range from human-based services to fully automated
software-based services.

We rely on the work from Ritter et al. [14] to classify the role of the service sys-
tems involved in a relationship in four distinct types captured with the concept
Role:
1. Customer,
2. Supplier,
3. Competitor, and

Complementors are the mirror image of competitors. In other words, cus-
tomers value a service more when complementors exist whereas they value a
service less when competitors exist [20]. A relationship with a target service of
