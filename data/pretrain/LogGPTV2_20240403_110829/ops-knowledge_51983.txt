User: So, what i am trying to do is LS Mimic in Python code.
I have completed most of the commands, but i have one thing that i cant find the solution
So, if the ls command gets this command line,
ls test1
It should find the test1 directory and then do the ls in that directory.
However, since I can only find ways of creating arguments that needs a keyword before the 
actual usage, I cant find the way of doing this..
it cant be something like this 
ls -move_dir test1
it is fine if for the program to think if there is no command, it will treat as above way.
( it will find that directory and run ls ) 
Please help me !!
Assistant: try looking into using sys.argv[]
