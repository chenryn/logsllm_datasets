mal beacon set. The concept of node arity in an undirected graph
G(V, E), deﬁned in [7], is useful for this discussion. Below, we
restate the deﬁnition from [7] in a slightly different manner.
Deﬁnition 2. (Node Arity) The arity of a node, u, with re-
spect to another node, v, is deﬁned as the number of distinct paths
that exist between the two nodes such that each of these paths starts
from a unique outgoing edge from u. The arity of a node u is de-
ﬁned as the maximum of arities of u with respect all nodes of the
graph.
Using the terminology of [7], we call a node “high arity” if the
node’s arity is more than one. Note that since G(V, E) is assumed
to be connected, there is at least one path from every node to ev-
ery other node (assuming |V | > 1). Hence, the arity of a node

algorithms for the Rocketfuel topologies.
is always greater than or equal to one. Also, since the maximum
number of distinct paths (with a unique outgoing edge) from u to v
can not be more than the degree of u, the arity of a node is bounded
by its degree. In [9], we present an efﬁcient algorithm for ﬁnding
whether a node in G(V, E) is high arity or not. Our algorithm is
based on the insight that if a node v has arity one, all forests gen-
erated in the depth-ﬁrst search from v will be connected to v by a
single edge.
The following theorems, proved in [9], establish useful proper-
ties of optimal beacon sets.
Theorem 4. A network with no high arity nodes can be moni-
tored by a single beacon on any node in the network.
This theorem implies that a minimum beacon set can be com-
puted trivially and optimally for any single-arity network (one that
contains only single-arity nodes), without using the “pruning” algo-
rithm presented earlier. In [9], we show that a single-arity network
is a tree.
Theorem 5. An optimal beacon set, when beacons are simple
or locally-ﬂexible, is a subset of the set of high arity nodes.
Theorem 5 lets us reduce the set of potential beacons used in
Algorithm 3 to the set of high arity nodes. This can lead to sub-
stantial computational savings. For instance, we show in Section 5
(and Figure 3), that the number and fraction of single arity nodes in
current ISP topologies can be quite high.
In [7] the authors have shown that the set of high arity nodes in a
graph is a beacon set—though potentially a non-optimal set—when
beacons are locally-ﬂexible. We have much strengthened this result
by showing that the optimal beacon set is always a subset of the set
of high-arity nodes (even with simple beacons). Not surprisingly,
our pruning algorithm is able to ﬁnd smaller beacon sets for all
topologies.
In order to numerically evaluate the efﬁcacy of our
formulations, we next present results of beacon set computations
on a few real ISP topologies.
5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we compute and compare the beacons sets yielded
for several current ISP topologies: (i) by the beacon placement so-
lution with locally-ﬂexible beacons suggested in [7]; (ii) by our
beacon placement algorithms for simple beacons; and (iii) by our
algorithms for locally-ﬂexible beacons. We refer to the resultant
beacon sets as BHA, BS, and BLF , respectively. We have imple-
mented these algorithms in Java and have run these on eight major
ISP topologies obtained from the Rocketfuel project at the Univer-
sity of Washington [8]. For each of the eight topologies, we analyze
the distribution of node arities and calculate the sizes of beacon sets
yielded by the three solutions.
Node Arities. The distribution of node arity for the eight topolo-
gies is plotted in Figure 3. We observe that:
1. The distribution of node arities are quite different for differ-
ent ISPs, indicating that ISP topologies can be quite diverse
in their topological structure. In particular, some ISP topolo-
gies have a long-tailed arity distribution, indicating that only
a handful of nodes have signiﬁcant redundancy in the man-
ner in which they connect to the rest of the network. For
most topologies, a majority of nodes have arities within 20,
although we some nodes can have arities higher than 150.
2. The fraction of single arity nodes in the ISP topologies varies
from less than 30% to more than 85%. It is important to note
that, for every other node in the network, a single arity node
has only one local edge that can be used to reach it. Single
arity nodes, therefore, are not robust to failures of local links.
We ﬁnd that for most topologies, more than half of the nodes
have a single arity.
A large fraction of single-arity nodes also implies that the
optimizations proposed in Section 4.1 to enable fast compu-
tation of beacon sets, can result in substantial savings.
It is important to observe that Rocketfuel ISP topologies are subject
to inference errors. In particular, [16] demonstrates that the inclu-
sion of links that do not exist and the omission of links that are
actually present can inﬂate path diversity in these inferred topolo-
gies. This limits the accuracy of node arities computed above.
Beacon Set Sizes. It is important to mention that the Rocketfuel
topologies for an ISP may not be connected (possibly due to lack
of data about some links). Thus, some of the topologies we analyze
have multiple (independent) connected components. More impor-
tantly, some of the components consist of only single-arity nodes
(such components have a tree structure). For a fair comparison with

works, we ignore such components when computing beacon sets.6
For any ISP topology, we add up the sizes of beacon sets com-
puted for each of the remaining components to get the total beacon
set sizes—|BHA|, |BS|, and |BLF|—for the three solutions being
compared. Figure 4 plots the histograms of these beacon set sizes
for the eight topologies. We observe that:
Another interesting direction in which our work can be extended
in by ﬁnding tree-like subgraphs in the network and use assign-
ing one beacon to every such subgraph. The probes and/or routers
would now need to be conﬁgured so that probe packets generating
within a subgraph remain conﬁned to the subgraph. This might be
helpful in reducing the number of probes required, and the distance
they travel, for monitoring all the edges of a large network.
1. Beacon sets with locally-ﬂexible beacons. Our beacon place-
ment solution for locally-ﬂexible beacons reduces the beacon
set sizes yielded by [7] by 50 − 70%. More importantly, we
ﬁnd that some major ISP topologies can be completely moni-
tored, independent of routing state, using less than a hundred
locally-ﬂexible beacons. This is an encouraging observation
as it suggests that a tomography-based monitoring infrastruc-
ture may not be infeasible even for major ISP topologies.
2. Beacon sets with simple beacons. Even with simple beacons,
our beacon placement solution reduces the beacon set sizes
of [7] by 40 − 70%. This suggests that it may be feasible
to design a simpler monitoring infrastructure that does not
require that network nodes use different transmission rules
for probe packets.
This conclusion is further supported by the comparison of
beacon set sizes yielded by our solution for simple vs. locally-
ﬂexible beacons, which indicates that locally-ﬂexible bea-
cons may not yield signiﬁcant gains for many major ISP
topologies.
6. FUTURE WORK
There are several ways in which our work can be extended. We
brieﬂy discuss a few below.
In this paper, we consider two kinds of beacons: simple and
locally-ﬂexible. An important component of our future work is to
generalize the notion of DMES for other kinds of beacons. For ex-
ample, the beacons could form an overlay and use routing-tunnels
to increase their DMES and reduce the beacon set size. We plan
to explore the trade-off between beacon complexity and the beacon
set size for monitoring realistic network topologies.
Our formulations assume that all high-level policies do not pro-
hibit the use of a certain physical path between two network nodes.
While this is a reasonable assumption for networks that are op-
erated by a single autonomous entity, this may not be true when
the network considered consists of multiple Autonomous Systems.
In particular, multi-homed stub networks typically do not provide
transit to trafﬁc arriving from one of their ISPs and destined to a
different ISP. We plan to extend our network model to incorporate
such networks and compute beacon sets for large internetworks like
the Internet.
An interesting extension of our framework is for monitoring in-
frastructure needed to monitor only a subset of all network links.
For instance, an ISP may be interested in monitoring only its back-
bone or peering links. One approach for ﬁnding a beacon set for
this scenario would be to create an abstraction in which some net-
work nodes are collapsed to create a new network that contains only
the relevant edges. The key challenges then would be in deciding
where to install the beacons (as a single node in the collapsed graph
may represent several nodes from the original network). We plan
to explore this problem as part of future work.
6This eliminates only a small fraction of nodes from each of the
ISP topologies.
