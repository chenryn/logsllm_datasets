### Malicious Beacon Set and Node Arity in Undirected Graphs

#### 1. Introduction to Node Arity
The concept of node arity in an undirected graph \( G(V, E) \), as defined in [7], is crucial for this discussion. We restate the definition from [7] with a slight modification.

**Definition 2. (Node Arity)**
- The arity of a node \( u \) with respect to another node \( v \) is the number of distinct paths between \( u \) and \( v \) such that each path starts from a unique outgoing edge from \( u \).
- The arity of a node \( u \) is the maximum arity of \( u \) with respect to all other nodes in the graph.

Using the terminology from [7], a node is called "high arity" if its arity is greater than one. Since \( G(V, E) \) is assumed to be connected, there is at least one path from every node to every other node (assuming \( |V| > 1 \)). Therefore, the arity of a node is always at least one. Additionally, the arity of a node is bounded by its degree because the maximum number of distinct paths from \( u \) to \( v \) cannot exceed the degree of \( u \).

In [9], we present an efficient algorithm to determine whether a node in \( G(V, E) \) is high arity or not. This algorithm leverages the insight that if a node \( v \) has arity one, all forests generated in the depth-first search from \( v \) will be connected to \( v \) by a single edge.

#### 2. Properties of Optimal Beacon Sets
The following theorems, proved in [9], establish useful properties of optimal beacon sets:

**Theorem 4.**
- A network with no high arity nodes can be monitored by a single beacon on any node in the network.
- This implies that a minimum beacon set can be computed trivially and optimally for any single-arity network (one that contains only single-arity nodes) without using the "pruning" algorithm. In [9], we show that a single-arity network is a tree.

**Theorem 5.**
- An optimal beacon set, when beacons are simple or locally-flexible, is a subset of the set of high arity nodes.
- This theorem allows us to reduce the set of potential beacons used in Algorithm 3 to the set of high arity nodes, leading to substantial computational savings. For instance, we show in Section 5 (and Figure 3) that the number and fraction of single-arity nodes in current ISP topologies can be quite high.

In [7], the authors showed that the set of high arity nodes in a graph is a beacon set—though potentially non-optimal—when beacons are locally-flexible. We have strengthened this result by showing that the optimal beacon set is always a subset of the set of high-arity nodes, even with simple beacons. Not surprisingly, our pruning algorithm finds smaller beacon sets for all topologies.

#### 3. Experimental Results
To numerically evaluate the efficacy of our formulations, we present results of beacon set computations on several real ISP topologies:

- **Beacon Placement Solutions:**
  - Locally-flexible beacons suggested in [7]
  - Our beacon placement algorithms for simple beacons
  - Our algorithms for locally-flexible beacons

We refer to the resultant beacon sets as BHA, BS, and BLF, respectively. These algorithms were implemented in Java and run on eight major ISP topologies obtained from the Rocketfuel project at the University of Washington [8].

**Node Arities:**
- The distribution of node arities for the eight topologies is plotted in Figure 3. Key observations include:
  1. The distribution of node arities varies significantly across different ISPs, indicating diverse topological structures. Some ISP topologies have a long-tailed arity distribution, suggesting that only a few nodes have significant redundancy in their connections. For most topologies, a majority of nodes have arities within 20, although some nodes can have arities higher than 150.
  2. The fraction of single-arity nodes in the ISP topologies ranges from less than 30% to more than 85%. Single-arity nodes have only one local edge that can be used to reach them, making them vulnerable to failures of local links. For most topologies, more than half of the nodes have a single arity.

A large fraction of single-arity nodes also implies that the optimizations proposed in Section 4.1 can result in substantial computational savings.

**Beacon Set Sizes:**
- It is important to note that Rocketfuel ISP topologies may not be connected due to missing data about some links. Thus, some topologies have multiple independent connected components. For a fair comparison with the previous work in [7], which does not apply to single-arity networks, we ignore such components when computing beacon sets.
- For any ISP topology, we sum the sizes of beacon sets computed for each of the remaining components to get the total beacon set sizes—|BHA|, |BS|, and |BLF|—for the three solutions being compared. Figure 4 plots the histograms of these beacon set sizes for the eight topologies. Key observations include:
  1. Our beacon placement solution for locally-flexible beacons reduces the beacon set sizes yielded by [7] by 50-70%. Some major ISP topologies can be completely monitored using fewer than a hundred locally-flexible beacons, suggesting that a tomography-based monitoring infrastructure may be feasible even for major ISP topologies.
  2. Even with simple beacons, our beacon placement solution reduces the beacon set sizes of [7] by 40-70%, indicating that it may be feasible to design a simpler monitoring infrastructure without requiring different transmission rules for probe packets.

#### 4. Future Work
Our work can be extended in several ways:

- **Generalizing DMES:**
  - We plan to generalize the notion of DMES for other kinds of beacons, such as those forming an overlay and using routing-tunnels to increase their DMES and reduce the beacon set size. We aim to explore the trade-off between beacon complexity and the beacon set size for realistic network topologies.

- **Network Policies:**
  - Our formulations assume that all high-level policies do not prohibit the use of certain physical paths between two network nodes. While this is reasonable for single-entity networks, it may not hold for multi-AS networks. We plan to extend our network model to incorporate such networks and compute beacon sets for large internetworks like the Internet.

- **Monitoring Subsets of Links:**
  - An interesting extension is to monitor only a subset of all network links, such as backbone or peering links. One approach is to create an abstraction where some network nodes are collapsed to form a new network containing only the relevant edges. The key challenge will be deciding where to install the beacons, as a single node in the collapsed graph may represent several nodes from the original network. We plan to explore this problem in future work.
