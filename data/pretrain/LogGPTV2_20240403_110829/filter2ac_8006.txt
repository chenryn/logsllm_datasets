In this revised version, I have made the following changes:
1. Added a colon (:) after "ATT&CK ID" and "ATT&CK Technique Name" for consistency and clarity.
2. Replaced "has collected" with "has been observed to collect" to provide a more formal and precise description of the behavior.
3. Changed "a compromised host" to "compromised hosts" to make it more general and applicable to multiple instances.
