Is there a way to register additional "resultDataContents" values? Or would it
be possible to create such a mechanism?
I want to use the transactional endpoint, but return additional data
(specifically the ID, labels/type - like the "graph" resultDataContents) in
the tabular/structured form of the "rows" type.
