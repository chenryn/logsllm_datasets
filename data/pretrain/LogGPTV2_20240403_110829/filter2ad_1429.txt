Abstract—With the significant growth in the cloud-based systems, 
many industries give their attention to cloud computing solutions.  
E-learning  is  a  promising  application  area  since  its  typical 
requirements such as dynamically allocation of computation and 
storage  resources,  coincide  well  with  cloud  characteristics.  This 
paper  presents  some  possible  cloud  solutions  in  e-learning 
environments  by  emphasizing  its  pros  and  cons.  It  is  of 
paramount importance to choose the  most suitable cloud model 
for  an  e-learning application  or  an  educational  organization  in 
terms  of  scalability,  portability  and  security.  We  distinguish 
various deployment alternatives of cloud computing and discuss 
their benefits against typical e-learning requirements.

interaction [3]. More recently, three cloud deployment models 
have been found admissible in the Cloud market:  
1)  Public cloud: This model is used by the general public 
cloud  consumers  and  the  cloud  service  provider  has  the  full 
ownership of the public cloud with its own policy, value, and 
profit, costing, and charging model [4]. It is the most common 
model of Cloud computing. 
2)  Private  cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  operated 
solely  within  a  single  organization,  and  managed  by  the 
organization  or  a  third  party  regardless  whether  it  is  located 
premise  or  off  premise  [4].  Especially  security  and  privacy 
concepts  enforce  organizations  to  use  this  model  of  cloud 
computing.

 INTRODUCTION 
in 
Internet 
technology  give  an 
opportunity  to  access  an  environment  that  allows  users  to 
develop and run applications. This  environment  includes data 
centers that are monitored and maintained by content providers 
[1].  Cloud  computing  is  a  promising  infrastructure  which  is 
based  on  this  paradigm.  Interactivity  and  collaboration  are 
major points of this new technology [2]. 
E-learning, which is the new trend of the education, should 
keep  up  pace  with  the  technology  to  satisfy  the  needs  and 
improve  the  quality  of  learning.  In  this  sense,  e-learning 
systems requirements coincide with Cloud computing benefits. 
There  are  several  cloud  computing  service  providers  that 
offer support for educational systems such as Amazon, Google, 
Yahoo  and  Microsoft.  They  provide  services  to  facilitate  the 
development  of  scalable  web  applications  in  a  dynamic  and 
virtualized sense. 
The  following  sections  include  cloud  computing  concepts 
and  principles  of  cloud  e-learning  solutions.  Also,  alternative 
approaches  for  cloud-based  e-learning  systems  have  been 
discussed. 
II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 
Cloud computing is  a model  for  enabling  convenient,  on-
demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing 
servers,  storage, 
applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and 
released with  minimal  management  effort  or service  provider 
(e.g.,  networks, 
resources 
3)  Hybrid  cloud:  The  cloud 
is  a 
combination  of  two  or  more  clouds  (private  or  public)  that 
remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized 
or  proprietary  technology  that  enables  data  and  application 
portability [4].

The  customers  can  choose  one  of  cloud  deployment 
models, depending on their requirements. 
III.  AN OVERVIEW OF CLOUD-BASED E-LEARNING 
SOLUTIONS 
Many  education 
institutions  do  not  have  sufficient 
resources  and desired  infrastructure  needed  to  run  popular  e-
learning solutions. This is why the biggest players in the field 
of  e-learning  software  have  now  versions  of  the  base 
applications that are cloud oriented. 
Some  important  merits  with  respect  to  cloud-based  e-
learning solutions are given below [5]; 
1)  Lower  costs:  You  don't  need  a  high-powered  and 
high-priced  computer  to  run  cloud  computing  web-based 
applications,  since  applications  run  in  the  cloud,  not  on  the 
desktop PC. 
2) 
Improved  performance:  Cloud-based  e-learning 
systems boot and run faster because they have fewer programs 
and processes loaded into device memory. 
3) 
Instant software updates: When the app is web-based, 
updates occur automatically and are available the next time you 
log on to the cloud.

4) 
Increased  data  reliability:  Even,  if  the  personal 
computer  crashes,  all  data  is  still  intact  in  the  cloud,  still 
accessible. 
5)  Device independence: You're no longer tethered to a 
single  computer  or  network.  Change  computers,  and  your 
existing  applications  and  documents  follow  you  through  the 
cloud. 
6) 
Improved  improbability:  It  is  almost  impossible  for 
any unauthorized person to have access any data by finding out 
digital assets (tests, exam questions, results) [2]. 
However, there are some risks besides these benefits; 
1)  Network: Internet connections are required, and stable 
ones  are  often  essential.  Also,  if  a  Cloud  connection  gets 
terminated during a session, users may lose time, work, or even 
unsaved data [6]. 
2) 
Security:  Many  organizations  feel  insecure  with  the 
idea of storing their data and applications on systems that they 
do not have full control [7]. 
3)  Portability:  The  ability  to  bring  systems  back  in-
house  or  choose  another  cloud  provider  will  be  limited  by 
proprietary interfaces [7]. 
IV.  CLOUD-BASED E-LEARNING SYSTEM ALTERNATIVES 
A.  Public Cloud Approach 
Choice of public cloud model is the most practical approach 
to get the quickest solution to develop a reasonable cloud-based 
e-learning  system.  When  the  requirements  under  product 
development  are  considered,  this  choice  makes  developers 
benefit  from  a  Cloud  solution  in  a  quickest  and  lowest  cost. 
However,  this  approach  provides  a  reason  of  discomfort  for 
organization  owners.  Migrating  workloads 
to  a  shared 
infrastructure  increases  the  potential  for  unauthorized  access 
and exposure. It is interpreted as a risk of security or privacy. 
Also, once an organization builds or transfers a system to use 
the benefits of public cloud provider’s offerings, bringing that 
system back in-house will be relatively difficult and expensive 
[7]. 
B.  Private Cloud Approach 
Operated Cloud within a single organization and controlled 
Cloud by the same organization or a third party provides nearly 
secure and portable cloud-based e-learning system [8]. On the 
other hand,  relatively  higher  costs are an  important drawback 
of this approach. Since the private cloud is hosted on sight, the 
organization  needs  to  provide  adequate  power,  cooling,  and 
general maintenance. Hence, the host organization also runs the 
risk of data loss due to physical damage of the unit. This data 
may contain crucial digital assets such as tests, exam questions, 
results, etc. [9]. 
C.  Hybrid Cloud Approach 
This approach provides an ease for bringing the e-learning 
system back-in house or transferring to another cloud provider 
by  decreasing  platform  dependence.  Also,  it  helps  even 
increasing  the  system  security.  Hence,  hybrid  cloud  model 
provides  an  environment  to  build  a  national  private  cloud 
system and operating system. However, considering that hybrid 
model  is  a  combination  of  public  and  private  models, 
distribution  of  units  between  these  models  is  significant  to 
address the requirements of the organization. Also, governance 
and  management  the  other  issues,  inasmuch  as  there  are  two 
different  models  in  use.  It  means  that  more  expertise  and 
increased consultancy costs are needed to install and maintain 
the system. 
V.  CONCLUSION 
Cloud  computing  has  an  essential  scope  to  make  a 
breakthrough  the  whole  education  system.  Hence,  e-learning 
solutions cannot decline the cloud computing trends. To verify 
this  idea,  cloud  computing  concepts  are  emphasized  and 
evaluated 
to  principles  and 
requirements  of  e-learning  solutions.  The  comparison  of 
deployment models,  depending  on  e-learning requirements,  is 
articulated  exhaustively.  However,  debates  about  Cloud 
deployment models still have not come to an end. It intensifies 
on the trade-offs about the cost and the risk management. 
in  this  paper  with  respect 
Creating  experimental  environments  and  measuring  the 
effectiveness of these systems will eventually lead to gathering 
practical information for taking next steps. Critiques of people 
who  get  involved  in  these  experiments  should  be  taken  in 
consideration  and  the  success  of  learners  should be  observed 
for  different  conditions.  Hence,  scientific  approaches  can  be 
applied much more effectively to real-world solutions. 
In this respect, cloud-based e-learning systems will help the 
students,  teachers,  institutions  and  learners  who  live  in  rural 
parts  of  the  world  reach  the  knowledge  shared  by  experts, 
professors etc. Governments will eventually start installing and 
using such systems in schools and colleges in the near future.
