#### 1.1 Purpose and Use of the CA-OCM
The CA-OCM is designed to help organizations manage the people-side of change, ensuring successful business outcomes. It provides a set of activities that:
- Address people issues during organizational changes.
- Facilitate communication to increase awareness and ownership.
- Identify and promote leadership support.
- Foster strong working relationships between project teams, sponsors, and stakeholders.
- Mobilize stakeholder commitment to implement change initiatives.
- Proactively identify and address resistance to change.
- Create a training approach to equip end users with the necessary knowledge and skills.

The CA-OCM is a practical guide for OCM Practitioners, providing recommended practices, activities, and tools/templates. It is intended for practitioners, project sponsors, participants, and stakeholders involved in OCM efforts.

#### 1.2 The Value of the CA-OCM
The CA-OCM offers several benefits:
1. A comprehensive guide for OCM Practitioners, using clear and practical language.
2. A structured framework, nomenclature, and toolset that can be customized to fit various project needs.
3. Guidance based on industry standards, best practices, and lessons learned.
4. A statewide perspective that integrates OCM with project management, BPR, PAL, and system development activities.

#### 1.3 A Thoughtful Approach to OCM
The CA-OCM provides a structured, disciplined, and repeatable approach to OCM. While tools and techniques are essential, the success of OCM also depends on the practitioner's skills and experience. An effective OCM Practitioner should possess the following:

**Knowledge:**

- Integration of strategy, technology, business processes, and people.
- Awareness of human resources processes and practices.

**Skills:**
- Strategic thinking to anticipate and address OCM priorities.
- Problem-solving to identify and resolve people-related issues.
- Collaboration and teamwork to foster positive team dynamics.
- Effective communication and facilitation.
- Strong listening and empathy to address employee resistance.

**Abilities:**
- Building and supporting effective project teams.
- Leadership and influence to gain stakeholder support and build trust.
