Organizational Change Management Framework
Overview of the CA-OCM Framework
Organizational  Change  Management  (OCM) 
is  a  discipline  that  helps 
organizations implement change to achieve measurable results in their business 
strategies,  work  processes,  structures,  technologies,  organizational  cultures, 
and management styles. These changes can be driven by implementation of 
a new mandate, process, technology, or strategy. OCM focuses on the people 
in the organization and on identifying and enhancing the “human factors” that 
will achieve and sustain desired project results, which can include improved 
efficiency, quality, timeliness, and cost avoidance.
The  California  Project  Management  Office  (CA-PMO)  has  developed  the 
California  Organizational  Change  Management  Framework  (CA-OCM  or  OCM 
Framework) to provide an OCM Practitioner with a practical guide for managing 
change within an organization. The CA-OCM provides guidance on OCM methods 
and approaches through the use of resources, tools, and templates, as well as 
narrative describing when and how specific OCM activities should be performed 
throughout the Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC).
While  the  CA-OCM  is  written  in  the  context  of  information  technology  (IT) 
implementation efforts, it is applicable to any type of project that requires an 
organization, its groups, and its people to change. This must be done with a 
thoughtful  approach  that  leverages  best  practices  and  lessons  learned  to 
help  navigate  California’s  unique  environment  and  characteristics.  The  OCM 
framework aligns to and can be used with the California Project Management 
Framework  (CA-PMF)  and  the  California  Business  Process  Reengineering 
Framework (CA-BPR or BPR Framework).
1.1  Purpose and Use of  
the CA-OCM
The CA-OCM is designed to assist organizations in managing the people-side 
of change in order to achieve business outcomes associated with that change. 
OCM  facilitates  the  transition  of  individuals,  teams,  and  organizations  to  a 
future state to achieve business benefits. To accomplish this, OCM takes into

consideration the complete organization and how the organization and people 
need to change. The CA-OCM provides a set of activities that:
•  Address the people issues that arise when an organization tries to  
make changes
•  Facilitate communication to increase awareness and ownership
•  Identify and promote leadership support
•  Foster strong and healthy working relationships between project teams,  
the Project Sponsor, and Stakeholders
•  Mobilize commitment of Stakeholders to implement a change initiative
•  Proactively identify and address resistance to change
•  Create a thoughtful training approach to provide opportunities for end 
users to gain knowledge and skills in order to succeed in the future state.
The  CA-OCM  is  a  practical  and  useful  guide  to  assist  an  OCM  Practitioner  
in implementing OCM efforts for projects of all sizes and complexity levels. The 
CA-OCM provides recommended practices, activities, and tools/templates for 
OCM efforts, in addition to leveraging industry standards and resources.
The intended audience for the CA-OCM includes Practitioners responsible for 
performing or managing OCM activities, roles that may be held by state and/
or  contractor  resources,  and  other  team  members  that  may  be  involved  in 
an  OCM  effort.  The  CA-OCM  also  provides  helpful  information  to  the  Project 
Sponsor, project participants, and Stakeholders regarding OCM concepts and 
best practices. The OCM Practitioner should leverage the tools/templates, as 
applicable, and modify them to fit specific project needs.
Projects  in  California  vary  in  size,  type,  and  complexity;  however,  despite 
these differences, the objectives of OCM remain consistent. To account for an 
organization’s  specific  project  needs,  the  OCM  approach  and  methods  used 
will  need  to  be  tailored  to  the  specific  organization  and  project.  The  OCM 
Practitioner should adjust the level of complexity and rigor to match the needs 
of  each  individual  project,  and  recognize  that  the  level  of  complexity  and 
rigor  will  differ  from  project  to  project.  The  CA-OCM  provides  guidance  and 
adaptability to account for these project differences.

1.2  The Value of the CA-OCM
The CA-OCM provides a common foundation for state organizations to leverage 
and apply to project implementation efforts, to strive for a level of efficiency 
and consistency in OCM practices across the state. The many benefits include:
1.  A guide for OCM Practitioners across a range of experience levels, using 
practical language and concepts that are easy to understand and apply.
2.  An OCM framework, nomenclature, and toolset with templates, 
examples, and instructions that can be customized to account for 
differences in project needs, but are structured to be consistently 
applicable across a wide range of project types, sizes, and complexities.
3.  Guidance based on industry standards, best practices, and  
lessons learned.
4.  A statewide OCM perspective which addresses the relationships 
between OCM activities, project management activities, BPR activities, 
Project Approval Lifecycle (PAL) activities, and system development 
activities.
1.3  A Thoughtful Approach  
to OCM
The  CA-OCM  offers  a  set  of  tools  and  techniques  to  provide  a  structured, 
disciplined,  and  repeatable  approach  to  OCM.  Though  a  set  of  tools  and 
techniques  can  increase  the  likelihood  of  success,  OCM  also  requires  the 
appropriate skills and experience to apply them. The ultimate success of an OCM 
effort depends on the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the OCM Practitioner.
An  OCM  Practitioner  needs  to  be  able  to  proactively  identify  change-related 
issues and to anticipate and plan for such challenges, mitigate issues as they 
arise, and work cohesively and effectively with a wide range of individuals. In 
leading OCM efforts, the OCM Practitioner should possess a set of knowledge, 
skills, and abilities that enable effective OCM activities and contribute to overall 
project success.

Knowledge
•  Organizational  change  management  concepts  and  methodology 
knowledge. While the CA-OCM describes key concepts, it is important for 
the OCM Practitioner to have OCM experience in order to effectively apply 
the OCM activities, tools, and templates, however, depending on that level 
of experience the value provided may fluctuate.
•  Integration  of  strategy,  technology,  business  processes,  and  people. 
The OCM Practitioner works in connection with many team members from 
other disciplines, including project management, technology, and business 
analysis.  Successful  OCM  efforts  depend  on  the  thoughtful  integration 
between these disciplines. As such, the OCM Practitioner must possess an 
understanding  of  these  additional  disciplines  and  the  interrelationships 
between them.
•  Human resources processes and practices. As part of the transition to a 
future state, the OCM Practitioner needs to be aware of human resource 
processes  and  practices.  Such  processes  and  practices  are  integral  in 
identifying  impacts  on  change  activities,  as  well  as  changing  job  roles  
and classifications.
Skills
•  Strategic Thinking. Effective OCM requires the OCM Practitioner to have a 
solid understanding of the organization and anticipate people’s reactions to 
change. It requires strategic thinking, since the OCM Practitioner will need to 
identify a strategy to address OCM priorities and issues on the project.
•  Problem-solving.  The  OCM  Practitioner  identifies  people-related  issues, 
assesses  those  issues,  and  determines  the  most  appropriate  solutions. 
The OCM Practitioner routinely uses problem-solving skills throughout the 
project and draws upon past experience to aid in decision-making.
•  Collaboration and teamwork. The OCM Practitioner should demonstrate 
an  ability  to  foster  positive  team  dynamics  and  promote  collaboration 
within  the  team.  While  the  OCM  Practitioner  focuses  on  facilitating  the 
people-side  of  change  initiatives,  the  entire  project  team  must  work  in 
concert for projects to be successful.
•  Communication.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  be  able  to  effectively 
communicate  and  serve  as  a  facilitator  to  help  achieve  the  project’s 
objectives. The OCM Practitioner needs to create meaningful messages and 
deploy communication techniques to foster effective participation.

•  Listening. The OCM Practitioner should possess strong listening skills and 
empathy  to  gain  trust  and  to  be  able  to  proactively  address  employees’ 
resistance to change.
Abilities
•  Build team effectiveness. The OCM Practitioner helps build and support 
effective project teams, moving them from the “forming” stage to the “high-
performing” stage.
•  Leadership  and  influence.  The  OCM  Practitioner  provides  leadership 
throughout  a  change  initiative.  The  OCM  Practitioner  needs  to  build 
relationships,  engage  with  Stakeholders  to  gain  support,  and  create  a  
high level of trust.

Framework Conventions and Structure
This section of the CA-OCM describes the conventions and structure that is used 
throughout. The graphical elements, strategic use of color, and call-out boxes 
are used to clearly communicate practical OCM concepts, as well as engage the 
reader’s attention and improve information retention. The structure of the CA-
OCM also organizes information through the use of chapters, knowledge areas 
(which are described later in this chapter), and key navigational elements to 
guide the reader.
2.1  Colors and Icon Conventions
Each chapter of the CA-OCM corresponds to a process phase of the PMLC and is 
identified with a specific color and distinct icon. These unique colors and icons 
are  presented  at  the  beginning  of  each  chapter  and  continue  throughout  to 
visually guide readers as they progress through the document.
Groupings of related OCM activities are organized into knowledge areas. These 
serve  to  organize  sets  of  OCM  activities  that  share  a  common  purpose  and 
objective. Activities from multiple knowledge areas may occur within a single 
process phase. These knowledge areas are represented by their own icons and 
colors placed below each PMLC process phase chapter header. The methodical 
use of color is designed to help readers navigate the CA-OCM quickly and easily.
Icons used throughout this framework are shown by grouping for your reference:

2.2  Chapters
The CA-OCM is comprised of eight chapters. These chapters organize content 
into logical domains to help readers easily navigate the document. The eight 
chapters of the OCM framework are:
Overview
This initial chapter provides an introduction to the CA-OCM and its 
purpose and use. It discusses how specific icons and colors are used 
to  facilitate  navigation.  It  also  offers  a  high-level  overview  of  the 
OCM lifecycle and knowledge areas, which are core elements of the 
OCM effort.
Templates
This chapter contains information about the collection of templates 
that are available as part of the CA-OCM to help the OCM Practitioner 
successfully conduct an OCM effort.
Concept
This  chapter  describes  initial  OCM  activities  at  the  inception  of 
a  change  initiative.  The  goals  of  this  process  phase  are  to  define 
the  change  initiative  and  communicate  it  to  key  leaders  and 
Stakeholders.
Initiating
This chapter provides guidance on how to identify OCM priorities and 
schedule OCM activities. In this process phase, the OCM Practitioner 
engages the Project Sponsor and other key executive leaders and 
defines the project team behavior guidelines.
Planning
This  chapter  provides  recommendations  for  the  OCM  effort 
during  the  Planning  Process  Phase.  The  OCM  Practitioner  will 
plan  and  implement  OCM  activities,  facilitate  high  level  project 
communications, engage key Stakeholders and leaders, and assist 
in building the project team.

Executing
This  chapter  provides  guidelines  for  the  OCM  Practitioner  to 
use  throughout  the  Executing  Process  Phase  when  the  system 
development activities begin. The OCM Practitioner works to engage 
and transition individuals and the organization to the future state.
Closing
This chapter details the principles, practices, and tools used during 
the final process phase. This process phase concludes the formal 
OCM  effort  by  closing  out  OCM  activities,  transitioning  remaining 
OCM responsibilities, and planning for ongoing training needs.
