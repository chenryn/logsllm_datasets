The advice on compiling the test:
    gcc -o test -I$JULIA_DIR/include/julia -L$JULIA_DIR/usr/lib -ljulia test.c
is wrong. For a start the directory $JULIA_DIR/include/julia doesn't exist.
This also affects the embedding example
https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/examples/embedding.c as the
manual page above seems to be the goto advice on how to compile it.
