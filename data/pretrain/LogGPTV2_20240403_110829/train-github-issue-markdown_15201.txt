When a field is not analyzed on index time, it is not possible to specify a
search_analyzer.  
I get a "analyzer on field [xxx] must be set when search_analyzer is set"
exception.
To me this does not make sense. I can set a keyword analyzer on the field to
circumvent this exception, which does exactly the same thing. However, while
doing that, I cannot enable doc_values.
I find myself duplicating fields many times because of this limitations.  
Those limitations are:
  * docvalues don't work on analyzed fields
  * search_analyzer cannot be specified on non-analyzed fields.
I presume ES is trying to protect me, but I _know_ what I'm doing.  
Is it possible to make this behavior more lenient?
