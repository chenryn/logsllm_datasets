User: My computer says...
"-bash: appcfg.py: command not found"
What is wrong? 
I can run my application using google-app-engine-launcher and I have python pre-installed.
I am trying to upload my app using "appcfg.py update myapp"
I am new to Mac development.
Assistant: Try: ./appcfg.py
Current dir is usually not part of path.
