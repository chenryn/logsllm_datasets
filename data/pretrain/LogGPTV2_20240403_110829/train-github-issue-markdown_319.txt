Hello,  
I'm running Airflow 1.10.10 and using the `GCSToBigQueryOperator` from
`airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_bigquery` in order to load
data from google cloud storage into a big query table.  
Although everything is working as expected, I keep seeing (a lot of)
deprecation warnings in my logs:
    DeprecationWarning: The bigquery_conn_id parameter has been deprecated. You should pass the gcp_conn_id parameter.
    bigquery.py:103: DeprecationWarning: This method will be deprecated. Please use `BigQueryHook.get_client` method`
    taskinstance.py:984: DeprecationWarning: This method is deprecated. Please use airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.bigquery.BigQueryHook.run_load`
    bigquery.py:1614: DeprecationWarning: This method is deprecated. Please use `BigQueryHook.insert_job` method.
Although everything is working well, I'm afraid that in the future those
warnings will indeed cause problems.  
Please update the code and find a way to use the suggested methods instead of
the deprecated ones.  
If any more information is needed from me regarding the warnings or my system
I will be happy to add it.  
Thank you!
