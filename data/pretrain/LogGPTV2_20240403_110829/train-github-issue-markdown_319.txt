Subject: Request for Assistance in Resolving Deprecation Warnings with `GCSToBigQueryOperator`

Hello,

I am currently using Airflow version 1.10.10 and the `GCSToBigQueryOperator` from the `airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_bigquery` module to load data from Google Cloud Storage into a BigQuery table. While the process is functioning as expected, I am encountering numerous deprecation warnings in my logs, which are as follows:

```
DeprecationWarning: The bigquery_conn_id parameter has been deprecated. You should pass the gcp_conn_id parameter.
bigquery.py:103: DeprecationWarning: This method will be deprecated. Please use `BigQueryHook.get_client` method.
taskinstance.py:984: DeprecationWarning: This method is deprecated. Please use airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.bigquery.BigQueryHook.run_load`.
bigquery.py:1614: DeprecationWarning: This method is deprecated. Please use `BigQueryHook.insert_job` method.
```

Although the current implementation works, I am concerned that these deprecation warnings may lead to issues in the future. To address this, I would like to update the code to use the recommended methods instead of the deprecated ones.

Could you please provide guidance on how to update the `GCSToBigQueryOperator` to use the suggested methods? If any additional information about the warnings or my system is needed, I am more than happy to provide it.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
