### Centralized Audit Server Solution for Multiple Server Management

We have dozens of Linux servers, and several developers, each responsible for different parts of the servers. Currently, each server has an admin account, and if a developer needs to manage a server, their public key is added to the `authorized_keys` file of the admin account, allowing them to access and modify the server. However, this approach has several drawbacks:

1. **Security Risks**: Each server's SSH port is exposed to the public, which is a significant security risk.
2. **Lack of Accountability**: If multiple people use the same admin account, it is impossible to determine who performed specific actions.
3. **Management Complexity**: Removing or revoking someone's SSH key across multiple servers is cumbersome.

### Proposed Solution

To address these issues, we propose implementing a centralized SSH audit and administration server. This solution would include the following features:

1. **Centralized Access Control**:
   - **Single Point of Entry**: Only the centralized server will have access to the SSH ports of the individual servers.
   - **User Management**: The centralized server will manage user accounts and access privileges for each server.
   - **Developer Access**: Developers will use the centralized server to perform server operations, with all actions recorded and monitored.

2. **Audit and Monitoring**:
   - **Action Logging**: All actions performed by developers through the centralized server will be logged.
   - **Alerts**: The system will generate alerts when potentially dangerous actions are detected.

3. **Emergency Access**:
   - **Backup Plan**: In case the centralized server goes down, there should be an emergency access solution in place to ensure business continuity.

### Implementation Details

1. **Provide Individual Accounts**:
   - Each developer should have their own account on the servers, rather than using shared admin accounts. This can be automated using configuration management tools like Puppet, Chef, or Ansible.

2. **Stop Using Shared Accounts**:
   - Eliminate the use of shared admin accounts to ensure that each action can be traced back to a specific user.

3. **Sudo Access**:
   - Grant developers the necessary sudo access to perform their tasks, ensuring that they have the required permissions without needing to log in as the root user.

4. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Use a tool like rsyslog to forward all logs from the individual servers to a central log server. This will allow you to monitor and track the activities of individual users.

### Additional Considerations

- **SSH Configuration**:
  - Ensure that SSH is configured securely, with password authentication disabled and only key-based authentication allowed.
  - Use strong passphrases for SSH keys to enhance security.

- **Education and Training**:
  - Educate developers on best practices for using their individual accounts and the importance of logging and monitoring.

By implementing this centralized audit and administration server, you can significantly improve the security, accountability, and manageability of your server infrastructure.
