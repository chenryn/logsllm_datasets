Remarks
Disk quotas are implemented on a per-volume basis, and they enable both hard and soft storage limits to be implemented on a per-user basis.
You can use write scripts that use fsutil quota to set the quota limits every time you add a new user or to automatically track quota limits, compile them into a report, and automatically send them to the system administrator in e-mail.
