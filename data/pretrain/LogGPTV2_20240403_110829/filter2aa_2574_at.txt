This site (https://peoplefindthor.dk) is a Facebook Graph Search generator with the 
most commonly used filters (see Figure 5-18).
Socmint
This site (http://socmint.tools) facilitates fetching information using Facebook Graph 
Search.
Facebook Graph Search is continually evolving as are its commands. Success in 
exploiting this search engine requires trial and error to find the query that returns 
the best results. You can achieve this by trying different variations of the same query 
Figure 5-17. The Facebook username (highlighted) is different from the name 
chosen by the user when creating an account (which appears in the Facebook 
search bar when visiting the target’s profile page)

(changing the query wording) to get the desired result. Bear in mind that Graph Search 
can be somehow dependent on your friend and mutual friend lists; the spread and 
diversity of your Facebook network can affect the overall Graph Search’s generated 
results.

 Collecting Local Copy of Target Facebook Data
If you are collecting evidence from Facebook for a lawsuit, make sure to save a copy of 
your findings (evidence) somewhere on your computer. Facebook is managed by its users, 
and any public post/photo can be suddenly deleted or become private by its owner. To 
save a copy of the posts or public profiles, save the page using your browser by selecting 
File and then Save Page As. Or you can simply print the specified page on paper. You can 
also take a screen capture of the page and save it as an image on your local computer.
OSINT analysts may need an offline version of the target’s Facebook data to make 
an advanced offline analysis or to create reports about a specific user profile or page. 
The Facebook native user interface does not provide any means of saving or printing a 
profile data for offline use, and saving a public profile page as an HTML page may not be 
a convenient solution, especially when you want to save a long page. http://le-tools.
com has developed a tool named ExtractFace to automate the extraction of data from 
Facebook profiles. To use this tool, follow these steps:
 1. Download the tool from https://sourceforge.net/projects/
extractface/?source=typ_redirect. Currently, the following 
prerequisites should be implemented before using this tool:
• 
You need to access your Facebook account using the Firefox ESR 
edition, which can be downloaded from https://www.mozilla.
org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/.
• 
You need the MozRepl add-on, which can be found at https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozrepl/. After 
installing this add-on, you need to start it or set the “Activate on 
startup” option to start it automatically when Firefox launches 
(see Figure 5-19).
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
229
• 
And of course you need to have a valid Facebook account, and 
you must sign into it when using this tool.
Warning! deactivate your firewall or allow connections to port 4242 before using 
this tool.
 2. To begin harvesting the target’s Facebook data, go to the target’s 
profile and right-click the ExtractFace icon—which is located in the 
Windows taskbar—to launch its options menu (see Figure 5-20).
Figure 5-19. Starting the MozRepl add-on or setting it to start automatically upon 
launching Firefox

 3. The first option in the menu is Scroll and Expand. It is advisable to 
use this option first before collecting the target’s friends, timeline, 
and comments (posts, photos, and video comments) as it will 
automate the process of scrolling through the entire page until the 
end before harvesting its data. This is necessary to avoid acquiring 
partial results from this tool when visiting lengthy pages or when 
you have slow Internet connection.
For example, to harvest a target’s Facebook friend list, go first to the target’s 
Facebook friend page, click the Scroll and Expand option to begin scrolling across the 
entire page, and click Dump Friends. A pop-up menu will appear asking you to select 
where you want to store your dump files. Select the location, and finally click the “Dump 
now” button (see Figure 5-21).

Most ExtractFace tool functions work with all people, pages, and group profiles.
Tip! Facebook does not notify the user when someone visits their Facebook 
profile or views their photo or video.
if you come across a locked-down Facebook profile (we mean here an account that 
has tightened privacy controls by hiding its friend list), you can reverse engineer 
the list of friends from the likes and tags associated with this account.
 Twitter
Twitter is the most popular microblogging social media platform with an average 330 
million active users monthly (as of the third quarter of 2017).ix It launched in 2006 with a 
main focus on sending SMS mobile communications messages online. Twitter allowed 
its users to post tweets with 140 characters. In 2017, Twitter expanded its characters 
count to allow 280 characters. Tweets can contain photos, short videos, and URLs in 
addition to text.

Twitter is mainly used to connect people with the same interests based on the 
content posted. To build online communities, Twitter use hashtags (prefixed with pound 
symbol, #) to group similar topics or subjects. People—even when they do not know 
each other—can engage in conversation based on a hashtag.
To register on Twitter, you need to have a phone number or email address to activate 
your account. In addition to a password, Twitter does not enforce using real names when 
registering for an account. Twitter uses the name handle to mean a Twitter username. 
A Twitter handle begins with the @ sign followed by alphanumeric characters without 
spaces (e.g., @darknessgate). A Twitter handle can be used to mention someone in 
public tweets or to send someone a private message. When using Twitter, you can follow 
other Twitter public profiles, and their updates will appear in your timeline.
Twitter allows you to conduct live video broadcasts using the Twitter Periscope 
service; you need to use the Twitter official app for this to work using your Android or 
Apple device.
Although the nature of Twitter does not provide the wealth of personal information 
provided by Facebook or LinkedIn (covered next), it’s still considered a powerful social 
media platform that can reveal useful OSINT information about some targets when 
investigated properly. For instance, geolocation data, personal interests, political 
and religious views, trips, and friends can be revealed by checking someone’s Twitter 
account.
 Twitter Search
Twitter has a simple search functionality located in the upper-right side of the screen—
when using the Twitter web interface—after logging into your Twitter account. A 
Twitter simple search allows you to perform a basic search within the Twitter database. 
However, do not underestimate this little box, as you can add advanced search 
operators—similar to Google advanced search operators—to your search query to force 
it to dive deep and return accurate results, as you are going to see next.
The best place to begin your Twitter search is to go to the Twitter search home 
at https://twitter.com/search-home (see Figure 5-22). From here, you can either 
conduct simple searches (e.g., search for Twitter profiles or tweets) or click “advanced 
search” to go to the Twitter advanced search page where you can set different filters on 
your search.

 Twitter Advanced Search Operators
The Twitter database is getting larger daily. About 8,000 tweets are posted each second.x 
This is equal to 480,000 tweets each minute. To find your way within this huge volume 
of data, it is necessary to use advanced search operators to refine your searches. The 
following search operators can be incorporated into a Twitter simple search to find 
related tweets more precisely:
• 
Use the “” operator to search for an exact phrase or word. Here’s an 
example: “OSINT intelligence”.
• 
To search for more than one search term, use the OR operator. Here’s 
an example: OSINT OR intelligence (this will search for tweets 
containing either the word OSINT or the word Intelligence or both).
• 
The negation operator (-) is used to exclude specific keywords or 
phrases from search results. Here’s an example: virus -computer. 
(This will search for tweets with the word Virus but not related to 
computer viruses.) The negation query can be expanded to exclude 
more words/phrases using the OR operator like this: Eiffel tower-
(trip OR new year OR vacation). This will search for Eiffel tower and 
exclude tweets about trip and new year and vacation.

• 
To search for tweets containing a specific hashtag, use the (#) pound 
sign. Here’s an example: #OSINT (this will search for all tweets 
containing the OSINT hashtag).
• 
To search for tweets sent from a specific Twitter account, use the 
operator from. Here’s an example: from:darknessgate (this will 
retrieve all tweets sent from the darknessgate account. You can filter 
the results based on people, photos, news, etc. (see Figure 5-23).
• 
The to operator followed by the Twitter handle will show all tweets 
sent to a specific person. Here’s an example: to:darknessgate (this 
will retrieve all tweets sent to the darknessgate account). You can 
filter the results based on people, photos, news, etc., as we did with 
the from operator.
• 
To find all tweets that reference a specific Twitter account, use the 
@ operator. Here’s an example: @darknessgate (this will retrieve all 
tweets that reference the darknessgate account).
• 
To search for tweets sent from a specific location, use the near 
operator followed by the location name. Here’s an example: “happy 
birthday” near New York (this will search for tweets containing the 
exact phrase happy birthday and sent from near New York).
• 
To search for tweets sent from within a specific distance from 
a specific location, use the within operator. Here’s an example: 
near:LA within:15mi (this will return tweets sent within 15 miles 
from Los Angeles).
Figure 5-23. You can use Twitter default filters to narrow your search results 
within a specific result set after using the From operator
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
235
• 
To search for tweets sent since a specific date, use the since operator 
followed by the date. Here’s an example: OSINT since:2014-11-30 
(this will return all tweets containing OSINT and sent since 
November 11, 2014).
• 
To search for tweets sent up to a specific date, use the until operator. 
Here’s an example: OSINT until:2015-11-30 (this will return all 
tweets containing OSINT and sent until date November 30, 2015).
• 
To find all tweets that ask a question, use the ? operator. Here’s an 
example: OSINT ? (this will return all tweets containing OSINT and 
asking a question).
The Filter operator is powerful to filter results based on different criteria. The 
following are examples of the most popular filters:
• 
To search within a Twitter conversation, use the filter operator with 
the replies keyword. Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:replies (this 
will return all tweets that contain the keyword OSINT and are replies 
to other tweets).
• 
Use the images keyword to return tweets that contain an image within 
it. Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:images (this will return all tweets 
that contain the keyword OSINT and have an image embedded 
within them).
• 
To return tweets with video embedded with them, use the videos 
keyword (similar to the images filter). Here’s an example: OSINT 
Filter:videos.
• 
To return tweets containing an uploaded video, Amplify video, or 
Periscope video, use the native_video operator. Here’s an example: 
OSINT filter:native_video (this will return all tweets containing the 
search keyword OSINT that have an uploaded video, Amplify video, 
or Periscope video).
• 
To return tweets with either image or video, use the media operator. 
Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:media.
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
236
• 
To return tweets with a news URL linked to them, use the news 
keyword. Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:news (this will return 
tweets containing OSINT within them that are mentioned by a news 
source).
• 
To return tweets that contain a link (URL) within them, use the links 
keyword. Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:links.
• 
To return text-only tweets, use the text keyword. Here’s an example: 
OSINT Filter:text.
• 
To return tweets from verified users only (verified accounts have a 
blue check mark near their names), use the Verified operator. Here’s 
an example: OSINT Filter:verified.
Tip! You can use the negation operator (-) with the Filter operator to reverse 
the examples already mentioned. For example, typing OSINT -Filter:images will 
return all tweets containing the OSINT search keyword but not containing images 
embedded within them.
• 
To search for video uploaded using the Twitter Periscope service, 
use the Periscope filter. Here’s an example: OSINT filter:periscope 
(this will search for all tweets containing the OSINT keyword with a 
Periscope video URL).
To search for tweets according to the number of likes, replies, and retweets, use the 
following operators:
• 
Use the min_retweets: operator followed by a number. Here’s an 
example: OSINT min_retweets:50 (this will return all tweets 
containing the OSINT search keyword that have been retweeted at 
least 50 times).
• 
Use the min_replies: operator followed a number to return all tweets 
with NUMBER or more replies. Here’s an example: OSINT min_
replies:11 (this will return all tweets containing the OSINT search 
keyword that have 11 or more replies).
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
237
• 
Use min_faves: followed by a number to return all tweets with 
NUMBER or more likes. Here’s an example: OSINT min_faves:11 
(this will return all tweets that have at least 11 or more likes and that 
contain the OSINT search keyword).
• 
To exclude retweets, use the -RT operator. Here’s an example: 
OSINT—RT (this will search for all tweets containing the OSINT 
search keyword but exclude all retweets).
• 
To search for tweets from a specific source, use the source 
operator followed by the source name. Here’s an example: OSINT 
source:tweetdeck (this will return all tweets containing OSINT and 
sent from tweetdeck (common sources are tweetdeck, twitter_for_
iphone, twitter_for_android, and twitter_web_client).
• 
To limit Twitter returned results to a specific language, use the lang 
operator. Here’s an example: OSINT lang:en (this will return all 
tweets containing OSINT in the English language only). To see a list 
of Twitter-supported language codes, go to https://dev.twitter.
com/web/overview/languages.
Note! twitter allows you to save up to 25 saved searches per account. to save 
your current search result, click “More search actions” at the top of your results 
page and then click “Save this search.”
Please note that you can combine more than one Twitter advanced search 
operator to conduct a more precise search. For example, type “OSINT intelligence” 
from:darknessgate -Filter:replies lang:en to get only the tweets containing the exact 
phrase OSINT intelligence from the user darknessgate that are not replies to other users 
and in the English language only.
 Twitter Advanced Search Page
The Twitter advanced search page (https://twitter.com/search-advanced) allows you 
to set different filters (language, location, keywords, date/time range) to return the best 
results. You can search for people, hashtags, and photos in any topic (see Figure 5-24).
