User: In a new SnowLeopard install, I'd like to use homebrew to install PIL. However the recipe installs PIL under cellar instead of in /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages. Is there a way to change the install directory?
Assistant: As @BarnabasSzabolcs mentioned, newer versions named pillow.
an alternative to brew install Homebrew/python/pillow is pip install pillow. You may need to add sudo, depends on your python environment permissions.
p.s.
that answer could be fit better as a comment, 14 credits to go...
