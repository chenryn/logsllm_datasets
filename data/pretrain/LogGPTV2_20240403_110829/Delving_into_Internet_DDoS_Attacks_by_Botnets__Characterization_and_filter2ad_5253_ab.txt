Internet activities (e.g., diurnal patterns in web access). This
is, however, anticipated since DDoS attacks typically are not
user-driven, thus lack recurring patterns.

Fig. 3. Attack interval: all attacks and family-based attacks
Simultaneous Attacks. We further extract the intervals be-
tween DDoS attacks. We deﬁne the intervals between two
DDoS attacks similar to that of the inter-arrival time: the time
interval between any two consecutive attacks launched by the
same botnet family (or on the same target; across multiple
families). Figure 3 shows the CDF of the attack intervals across
all attacks and attacks launched by each family. Note that x-
axis is in log scale.
Attack intervals observed from all attacks and family-based
attacks show consistent patterns. Clearly, more than half of
the attacks are launched simultaneously, which is less likely
to be a coincidence—we will investigate that later. For family
based attacks, we found that the longest attack interval was
59 days, almost two months. Also, 80% of the attack intervals
lasted less than 1081 seconds, which is roughly 18 minutes.
The average DDoS attack interval was 3060 seconds and the
standard deviation was 39140 seconds. Those numbers, and by
observing the CDF in Figure 3, tell that the attack intervals
follow two extremes: except for 15% of the attack falling in the
[1, 000, 10, 000] seconds interval, the majority of the attacks
(about 50%) are concurrent, with less than 1% of the attacks
at least one order of magnitude larger than the rest of attack
intervals.

Fig. 2. Daily Attack Distribution
As these concurrent attacks are very interesting, we take a
closer look at them. We ﬁnd that they can be classiﬁed into
two categories: attacks launched by a single botnet family
and attacks launched by multiple families. Attacks in the
ﬁrst category happened 3692 times and attacks in the second
category happened 956 times.
For the ﬁrst category, we found that seven out of the
10 botnet families exhibit such behavior. Among all fami-
lies, Dirtjumper is the most active in launching simultane-
ous attacks; 10% of the attacks launched by Dirtjumper are
simultaneous. For the second category, we found that most
common combinations were Dirtjumper with Blackenergy and
Dirtjumper with Pandora, which happened 391 and 338 times
respectively. This ﬁnding is very interesting, and further inves-
tigation is dedicated to understand it in §V.
From a family’s perspective, Figure 4 further shows the
intervals of all attacks by Dirtjumper in the order of their
occurrence; the x-axis represents the attack number and the
y-axis represents the corresponding interval in seconds. From
this ﬁgure, we observe that the attack intervals are random.
While Dirtjumper is used as an example, other families exhibit
the same pattern of random interval distribution.

Figure 5 shows the attack interval CDF for each family,
where the x-axis represents the attack intervals in seconds
and each color represents a single family. Note that the x-
axis is in log scale (base 2) to highlight the trend and pattern
in the intervals for the various families. From this ﬁgure we
observe that Blackenergy, Aldibot and Optima launch 40%-
50% of attacks simultaneously or within a short time frame.
We also observe that both Aldibot and Optima have no attacks
with intervals that are less than 60 seconds. This could be a
strategy utilized to evade detections. Finally, from the same

active ones.
B. Attack Duration
The duration of an attack is one aspect that measures
its strength and longevity. In our dataset, the measurement
of duration is in a way aggregate and doesnt differentiate
between providers and their capability. Figure 6 depicts the
durations of all DDoS attacks, where the x-axis represents
the attacks along time while the y-axis represents the attack
duration in seconds. Simultaneous attacks are ordered based on
IP addresses. As shown, the attack duration varies signiﬁcantly:
while the average duration is 10,308 seconds, the median
is only 1,766 seconds, with a standard deviation of 18,475
seconds (which indicates wide-spread).

Figure 7 further shows the corresponding CDF of the attack
duration. As shown, 80% of the attacks last for less than 13,882
seconds (∼four hours). Choosing four hours as the cut-off for
the majority of attacks duration is perhaps not arbitrary. This
value indicates that four hours might be a reasonable duration
for DDoS attacks to be detected and mitigated. An adaptive
attacker using such a strategy would evade detection for the
longest possible time for most attacks. That is, the longer the
attack lasts, the higher its chances are of being detected. By
limiting attack to four hours, the attacker can successfully
reduce the detection rate, and thus can repetitively launch
more attacks later without risking being blacklisted. Compared
with the literature [11], where it was shown that 80% of
attacks in a comparable study last for less than 1.25 hours,
this ﬁnding is interesting in itself: DDoS attacks are becoming
more persistent by lasting longer; however, their duration is
still smaller than the required time frame for detections.

Fig. 7. Duration CDF
Summary. 80% of the attacks have a duration less than four
hours, where targets are constantly attacked. This is more likely
to be a strategy, rather than the effectiveness of defenses. This
further demands automatic detection and defense instead of
any semi-automatic or manual approaches. Only the former
can effectively respond in such a short time frame. Without
such an automatic system in place, the detection is not possible
for one-time attack targets. For targets that are repetitively
attacked, investigation of the attack intervals may be helpful.
IV. ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF DDOS TARGET AND
SOURCE
Having analyzed the attacks distribution and duration, we
now shift our attention to the geolocation of these attacks
from the target and source perspectives, respectively. To avoid
being detected, some attacks could be split into multiple stages,
and individual staged attacks could be launched periodically.
Therefore, we ﬁrst study how many attacks a victim received in
our log. Along this line, we can identify those long-term targets
and short-term targets for some DDoS malware families.
A. Source Analysis
Geolocation afﬁnity is a direct indicator of how an attacker
is geo-spatially distributed. To further quantify the geolocation
afﬁnity, we extract all
the bots involved in DDoS attacks
for each family and aggregate the number of these bots per
383383
week. Thus, we are able to observe the attack source and
their migrations over weeks. We deﬁne such changes as a
shift pattern. Figure 8 shows the dynamic per week as a
shift pattern of Optima. The grey bars represent the shift
among the same group of countries while the green bars
represent the shift to new countries. From this ﬁgure we can
see clearly that most of the attack sources will be limited to
the same group of countries (other families not shown have
the same pattern, conﬁrming that most of these attacks are
highly regionalized). Next, we explore how the geolocations
of different bots participating in attacks change over time.

Fig. 8. Botnet shift pattern of Optima
In our dataset, each DDoS attack could be illustrated by a
series of snapshots along time. In each snapshot, as discussed
in §II, IP addresses of all bots evolved at the given time
were recorded. Since every IP address corresponds to a single
location (longitude and latitude pair), we are able to identify
the locations of all the bots involved on a map. We use such
information to characterize source locations. First, we ﬁnd the
geological center point of the various locations of IP addresses
at any time. Then, we calculate the distance between each
bot and this center point (using Haversine formula), and add
the distances together. In our analysis,
the distance has a
sign to indicate direction: positive indicates east or north, and
negative indicates west and south. For simplicity, we consider
the absolute value of the sum of all distances; a sum of zero
means that participating bots are geographically symmetric.
We use these distances to represent the geolocation distribution
of the bots. We calculate this value across all the families and
plot the CDF of geolocation distributions in Figure 9.
In this ﬁgure, six families with at least 10 snapshots (with
active attacks for more than 10 days) are reported. From
Figure 9, we observe that not all the families follow the same
distribution of location proximity. For the families Optima
and Blackenergy, the distances exhibit a normal distribution,
whereas other families have a skewed distribution. The families
Dirtjumper and Pandora both have more than 40% distribution
distances of zero, indicating complete geographical symmetry.
Later, we will show that Dirtjumper and Pandora collaborate
with each other closely, which may explain the similar distribu-
tion of their geolocation distances. Furthermore, the different
distribution patterns suggest that geolocation distribution is less
likely to be random, but rather part of the attack and infection
strategy, which could be further conﬁrmed later.
