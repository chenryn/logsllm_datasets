Feature
**What is the current behavior?**
If a component's render method throws an error, it leaves React in an
inconsistent state.  
Subsequent renders attempt to update the inconsistent component and result in
errors like "Cannot read property 'getHostNode' of null".
**Proposed behavior**
React could catch the error from the render method, set an "inconsistent
state" flag and re-throw it.  
Afterwards, if React is about to update the previously rendered component, but
this flag is set, it could discard or unmount the existing component and
perform a fresh render, as if the container were empty.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this
issue?**
I've encountered the inconsistent state problems in 15.5 and 15.6
