The common testing framework still needs some work that I think is quite
important to ensure consistency and stability.  
This issue is my wishlist, if any one wants to give it a shot (and so that I
don't forget).
  * test how classifiers handle only one class being present
  * check clustering and transformer objects
  * check how non-numeric-contiguous labels are handled in classifiers
  * test for consistent output shapes in regressors / classifiers / transformers
  * test how methods handle non-float input (does uint8 give overflow errors?)
