User: I have installed Cygwin Terminal in OS Windows. But I need to install also python and make in cygwin.All of these programs are needed to run petsc library.
Does Someone know how to install these components in cygwin?
Assistant: @spacediver is right on. Run cygwin's setup.exe again and when you get to the packages screen make sure you select make and python (and any other libs/apps you may need - perhaps gcc or g++).
