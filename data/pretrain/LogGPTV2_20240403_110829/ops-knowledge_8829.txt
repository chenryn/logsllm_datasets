User: How can I capacity plan my application to avoid performance issues?
Assistant: 1. Conduct demand research and analysis. Before application development, needs research and analysis are required to determine the functional and performance requirements of the application. This can help the development team to formulate the appropriate architectural and technical solutions to ensure that the performance and capacity of the application meet the needs. 2. Design a reasonable architecture and data model. When designing an application, a reasonable architecture and data model needs to be considered to ensure that the program can efficiently handle large amounts of data and requests while improving the scalability and reliability of the system. 3. Do a stress test. In the later stage of application development, stress testing is required to simulate the actual user access and request volume. This can help the development team discover performance bottlenecks, perform targeted optimization, and formulate reasonable capacity planning. 4. Use performance monitoring tools. After the application is running, you need to use performance monitoring tools to monitor the system operation, discover and deal with performance problems in time, and avoid serious problems such as system crashes or shutdowns. 5. Adopt cloud computing and containerization technologies. Cloud computing and containerization technologies can help development teams achieve automatic capacity expansion and load balancing to improve system capacity and performance while reducing costs and management complexity. Therefore, cloud computing and containerization technologies should be considered in capacity planning.
