Hello,

I recently customized the navigation bar variables on the Bootstrap customization page (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html), but I noticed that the colors I selected were not applied correctly. 

Upon further investigation, it appears that some of the variables defined on the customization page are being overridden by others that are not present in the customization interface. For instance, the color set for the `@navbarLinkColor` variable is being overridden by the `@navbarInverseLinkColor` variable.

This is problematic because the `@navbarInverseLinkColor` variable cannot be set during the customization process. As a result, when a user attempts to use an inverted navigation bar, their customizations are overwritten by the default value of `@navbarInverseLinkColor`.

I am reporting this issue to bring attention to the inconsistency and to request a resolution so that users can fully customize the navigation bar as intended.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
