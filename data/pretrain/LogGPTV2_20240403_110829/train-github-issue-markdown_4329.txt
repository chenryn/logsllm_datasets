Hi,
I customized the navigation bar variables @
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html on the website but these
colours were not picked up.
I have spotted that this could possibly be with some variables not present on
the page overriding the current variables on the page.
For example, the colour set for the variable @navbarLinkColor gets overriden
by the colour set by the variable @navbarInverseLinkColor.
I am reporting this because the variable @navbarInverseLinkColor cannot be set
during the customization stage so when a user tries to use the inverted
navigation bar, their customization gets overwritten.
