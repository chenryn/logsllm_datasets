of patterns. Combining that with your experience is what allows you
to predict what happens next, which is another important skill as an
attacker. For instance, knowing that the security guards’ shifts cross
over at 7 a.m. allows you to predict the best entry times (between
6:55 a.m. and 7:05 a.m.), the best exit times, and, if burned by one,
when the best time to try again. It also brings into play mental agil-
ity once more; you might have intel that had led you to believe one
thing, like the back entrance is to the back left of the building, only
to get there and see a much better ingress opportunity.

Think of it like learning to drive: you get the mechanics of driv-
ing down, but actually reading the road is what keeps you safe. You
start to understand typical road patterns and on- road etiquette. The
more you observe of the world and people, the better you become at
detecting patterns. Subsequently, you get better at predicting what
will happen next and, invariably, the better attacker you will become.
Lastly, ordinary members of the public, and indeed the typical
workforce, use observation to collect information and then move
on; AMs urges you to return to observing again and again, engaging
in the cycle of observing, recording, testing, and analyzing many
times over. It’s a lot more work than just looking, but it will help you
hone attacker offensives and build intuition for those times when
reasoning is too costly.
Tying It All Together
Tversky and Kahneman did not suggest that every judgment we
make is made intuitively or via heuristics; they theorized, and argu-
ably confirmed, we have a strong tendency to use intuitive pro-
cesses to make many judgments. Kahneman claimed judgments
are made from two different systems. One is intuition, regarded as
quick, automatic, and implicit. It uses associated strengths to arrive
at solutions. The second system is reasoning, considered to be exact-
ing and deliberately controlled. If no intuitive response is accessi-
ble, then reason will be used to arrive at judgment. Steven Sloman,
professor of cognitive, linguistic, and psychological sciences at
Brown University, once stated that the systems work hand in hand
as “two experts who are working cooperatively to compute sensible
answers.” You can find more on Sloman in the notes section.
No matter how you train your brain and what happens in any
one isolated incident, this observation and analyzation process
allows you to pay more attention and witness more of the world.
The real challenge is deciding what to explore in observation and
what to disregard. To practice, you might choose to observe your
immediate surroundings each day—p eople, too—l etting your brain
124 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
note all the small things you rarely take into consideration and
studying them with a renewed sense of curiosity.
There is one other key to observation: how you will be observed
as an attacker. You now know as much as I do about how the brain
observes its surroundings. You should be able to use this knowl-
edge against your targets. The best analogy I have involves magic.
Magicians don’t actually make things disappear or conjure changes
out of thin air. Instead, they engage in actions that misdirect our
attention. As an attacker, in phishes, in vishes, and when attacking
in person—a nd this applies to pentesters, too—t here is a similar
situation at play: you are creating an illusion, which ultimately is
your pretext, that redirects the target’s attention. You want them to
observe the illusion you are presenting, the details you have thought
out, and the narrative you’re painting for them. You are using their
narrow field of observational capacity against them. I will cover this
topic further in Chapter 8, “Attack Strategy.”
Critical and Nonlinear Thinking
Critical thinking is a rich concept, but because of this, its opera-
tional definitions don’t yet exist in a concise or cohesive way in lit-
erature. It has a definition, of course, but just saying that it is the
ability to “use reasoning, applied logic, and to make judgments” is
lacking, more so in the context of AMs. This definition, or any slight
variation of it, probably won’t serve us in taking critical think-
ing from the abstract into our arsenal. Critical thinking has also
become a recognized construct in philosophy, education, psychol-
ogy, and professional services. Unfortunately, its existence in those
fields only serves to more greatly fragment what are considered to
be its core functions. But as an attacker, you must have a working
knowledge of critical thinking and know how it pertains to your
specific field. Information processing is where critical thinking and
AMs meet. Information is the lifeblood of the attack; using reason
and logic against that information is often all that stands between
you and success in an attacker situation. Critical thinking has to
Information Processing 125
go hand-i n- hand with mental agility, which is the ability to apply
information successfully to your circumstances and objective.
To successfully understand critical thinking as it pertains to
you as an attacker, let’s return to our chess model. In chess, visual
memory, attention span, and the capacity to predict and anticipate
consequences are used to evaluate alternatives. That all sounds a
bit fancy if you don’t play or understand chess, but ultimately it
boils down to this: all of that is demanded from each player because
of the objective of chess. The name of the game is to checkmate
the opponent, leaving them no legal way to remove their king from
attack. The same is true when predicting and executing an attack:
you must be able to think through your moves and their possible
consequences (ensuring you’re keeping the end in mind); you will
have to be able to maneuver through the conditions set out for you,
too (the scope). Just like the objective in chess, you use your objec-
tive in the attack to drive your decision-making at all times, aiming
to checkmate the target, although typically without them knowing.
And never leave yourself at risk, which is most often achieved with
a solid pretext.
Sometimes you will have to make rapid decisions where exten-
sive critical thinking is not an option. Other times, you will have
weeks or even months to apply critical thinking skills. Critical
thinking is an important part of performance. Mentally manipul-
ating information to make effective decisions requires two things:
the first is information; the second is the ability to evaluate it and
arrive at a decision or result. This makes thinking critically seem
like it’s just the simple processing of information (found or given)
and arriving at a conclusion, and I suppose that covers a big chunk
of it. In any case, critical thinking is, to me, ultimately how you as
an attacker judge something. It is you who assigns weight to the
items you are judging. Robert Ennis, one of the leading research-
ers on critical thinking, believes critical thinking to be “reasonable,
reflective thinking that is aimed at deciding what to believe or what
to do.”
Deciding what to do as an attacker has two parts. First, you
have to know why you’re doing what you’re doing (or trying to do),
126 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
which is law one of the mindset. Then you have to decide how best
to achieve that end state or goal. So, critical thinking is applicable
whenever you’re trying to decide what to believe or what to do.
Thinking critically about a question or problem is likely to lead to
the right answer or solution. By thinking critically, you increase
your chances that your beliefs will be true and your actions effec-
tive. As David A. Hunter says in A Practical Guide to Critical
Thinking (Wiley, 2nd edition, 2014), “Thinking critically may not
guarantee that you get the right answer; but a good case can be
made that unless you think critically you will get the right answer
only by luck, and relying on luck is not a wise policy.” Both Hunter
and I are in agreement about the following, too: critical thinking
has more significance and substance than just being close to truth.
Critical thinking is also freedom. Making up your own mind about
any action is essential in every aspect of life and in every aspect of
being an ethical attacker.
Here is another high- value benefit of critical thinking: there are
times when you find or receive information that is either incom-
plete or unreliable. Evaluating its quality becomes paramount for
competent decision-making. This happens in the OSINT phase of a
job and in real time as you enter an environment.
The popular rehashing of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder’s con-
cept states that “No plan survives contact with the enemy.” Believing
this to be true, then critical thinking in the moment is more impor-
tant than critical thinking in planning. In other words, engage-
ments rarely occur in accordance with the original plan. To be clear,
this isn’t me advocating on behalf of critical thinking being punted
in the primary stages of an engagement; rather it’s the opinion that
both matter—t hinking critically in terms of the plan and critical
thinking in terms of pivoting. In other words, in-t he- moment criti-
cal thinking will matter in any case; critical thinking in planning
will only matter if it all goes to plan. It. Rarely. Goes. To. Plan.
It is of the utmost importance to note that critical thinking in
physics is different from critical thinking in design or security. The
standards and methods differ from one discipline to the next, but
there is a fundamental essence of critical thinking that remains the
Information Processing 127
same across all disciplines: you’re using reasoning above all else to
arrive at your outcome.
Vector vs. Arc
Being able to think through information and taking it in order to
analyze it is a skill in which the process is invisible, but for which the
outcome is astoundingly valuable and often seen by everyone. This
is critical thinking: an invisible process with a detectable outcome.
Critical thinking, for me, goes like this, whether I’m pressed for
time or sitting with an abundance of it: I fast-f orward to the end
goal (spoiler alert: I live for law one). For clarity, that end goal might
be just a building block of the overall objective (the vector), like get-
ting into an elevator in a secured building. But it also might be the
core objective of the attack (the arc). This is vector versus arc, and
both exist in tandem as you are actively attacking a target. You care
about the main objective, and you are always working toward it,
but you may have to break it down into smaller chunks to achieve
it. Knowing both exist and having each matter to you simultane-
ously will help steer you to short- term and long-t erm success, even
if the two aren’t aligned completely at all times— like getting out of
an elevator on the 35th floor when you need to be on the 38th in a
rather secure building.
There is another school of thought that considers critical think-
ing as the ability to scan the environment and create solutions for
complex problems or barriers. Pushing both of these philosophies
together is probably the closest to a well-r ounded description as
is possible to get of critical thinking in conjunction with AMs.
Smashed together as such, critical thinking can be thought of as
the ability to identify a problem and solve it using logic and creative
reasoning. Critical thinking is the intersection of visual memory,
attention span, and the prediction of consequences coming together
to drive decision-making.
Rounding off this concept of vector versus arc or short-t erm ver-
sus long- term actions and goals, you can think of it like this: similar
128 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
to seeing the situation from a bird’s eye view instead of a path, the
arc is the whole picture. The vector is a step to get there. The arc is
the focus on the outcome; the vector is the shorter steps to get there.
Both are needed to get the job done.
Education and Critical Thinking
Critical thinking, defined as the intersection of visual memory,
attention span, and the prediction of consequences coming together
to drive decision-making, is lacking in today’s world, possibly
because information is so readily available to the general popula-
tion without much need or motivation to check whether it’s valid.
The same is true of students in large part because of how the edu-
cation system is set up. Academically, critical thinking as a skill is
deficient because education in nearly all forms traditionally relies
on the collection of content knowledge. This approach neglects
to teach the reasoning skills that can process such knowledge. In
short, education and training may not have kept up with changes in
skill demand for today’s society where problem solving and analy-
sis can often outplay status quo beliefs. Your job as an attacker isn’t
to collect information— your job is to process it, weaponize it, and
leverage it.
Workplace Critical Thinking
This brings us to the overlapping topic of critical thinking in the pro-
fessional workplace. “Critical thought” is—a nnoyingly— a trending
buzzword in workplaces the world over at the moment. The concept
of it is fashionable and desirable in professional offices but almost
certainly being conducted in the antithesis of its core role; being
told to critically think to reach some arbitrary conclusion under the
guise of critical thought by your superiors, teammates, or any other
faction within your working environment is the great suppressor of
critical thinking. What you are being told to do is perform a cultur-
ally subjective analysis. I am against this in its entirety. If you have
Information Processing 129
gotten into the habit of this and think that your critical thought
should lead you to the same conclusions as those of your peers or
coworkers, you may have to work to shed this habit. Organizations
can thrive through this sort of cultural shift.
Company culture is a large talking point. Culture is not some-
thing that can be designed, per se. A company’s culture is the byprod-
uct of consistent behavior; it is what a company’s employees (of all
levels) do consistently. It is not what is written in the company’s
handbook nor what is touted through the intranet or at staff meet-
ings. It is, simply, how employees interact, are treated, and behave
most often. This is important to note if you are an “in-h ouse” red
teamer or attacker. You cannot and should not be expected to oper-
ate under the same cultural expectations and restraints as a regular
employee. You should not be concerned with the company’s culture
at all unless it serves you in terms of social engineering and aligning
your persona with what is typical within the company.
To me, the job of the employer is to give information and be
willing to consider your evaluation of it. Your job is to present your
analytical findings in a professional way and to take critical feed-
back that definitively exposes holes in your thinking. All work-
places should foster critical thinking abilities in this way, because
alternative thought has the potential to be the greatest defender in
environments where individuals, facilities, and critical infrastruc-
ture face a heightened risk of attack or downfall due to outdated
methodology and ideology.
Self- branded, useful critical thought can make you valuable to
those who want to hire you: you do not think like them culturally;
you are not predictable because of the organization you work for.
Critical Thinking and Other Psychological
Constructs
To get to the bottom of critical thinking and how to use it as an
attacker, you might find it helpful to conclude whether you are an
episodic or dispositional critical thinker. Episodic is a state or process
130 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
that’s limited in time; dispositional critical thinking is a tendency to
behave in certain ways most of the time. In any case, the same skills
are required, but for those of you who identify as an episodic critical
thinker, a prompt may be necessary to kick you into gear.
Critical Thinking Skills
Critical thinking is heavily related to problem solving, but that is not
its only function. Critical thinking is a process that serves many other
cognitive tasks such as inference making, evaluation of information
and sources, and reasoning. Also, critical thinking has some connec-
tion with heuristic analysis. In cases where there is poverty of infor-
mation or something is completely novel, critical thought may defer
to heuristics. Critical thinking skills also involve the unbiased extrac-
tion of information from text done through the dynamic process of
questioning and reasoning. Critical thinking also encompasses form-
ing and testing hypotheses. The skills have been categorized into four
types: interpreting, reasoning, assessing, and monitoring. One of the
greatest uses of critical thought is decision-making.
Critical thought serves decision-making because it allows the
evaluation of information. In the applied setting of AMs decision-
making, forming models of your own actions in regard to target
decision-making, then using those models to develop proactive,
predictive, and reaction plans, can improve the accuracy of your
assessment of engagement situations. This speaks to the mental
model of chess, which we have discussed throughout. In perform-
ing this game of mental chess in your mind, making up scenarios
based on possible happenings and reactions you might come across
on an engagement will help build mental agility and, over time,
improve their accuracy.
Critical thinking will eventually turn into a type of intuition.
After all, critical thinking is using analysis and evaluation to make
judgments, which is the purpose of your intuition. The key differ-
ence is that critical thinking is the objective analysis and evaluation
to form a judgment, whereas intuition bypasses that, at least on a
conscious level.
Information Processing 131
Nonlinear Thinking
Intuition is not based on linear, logical thinking. It is a momen-
tary gut feeling instead of a logical choice. Logic is encompassed
within critical thinking, which we have talked about at length now.
Problem solving is also a part of critical thinking. In the field, you
will come up against a great many problems, and you cannot force
your way through or out of everything. There is another, and at
times functionally overlapping, type of thinking that can greatly aid
problem solving: nonlinear thinking. A nonlinear thinker tends to
have a multitude of separate thoughts that somehow interrelate—a
sort of ability to free associate. They can find connections between
seemingly unrelated thoughts and things, then present them as if
they are completely logical. This type of thinking can be extremely
useful and can greatly engender creativity.
