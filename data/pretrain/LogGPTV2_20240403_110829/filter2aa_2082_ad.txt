4.4 Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) Vulnerability Timeline 
Table 5 shows when a particular build for a target market was introduced and whether the build contains a 
vulnerable version so the com.asus.splendidcommandagent platform app for the Asus ZenFone 3 
(ZE552KL) device. The build fingerprint is provided to uniquely identify the build. The vulnerability was 
first introduced in the worldwide market in March, 2017 for the Asus ZenFone 3 device. All other markets 
became vulnerable within the next two months except for the Chinese market. This is due to the Chinese 
market being held at the Android 6.0.1 (API level 23) for at least 14 months while the worldwide market 
moved to Android 8.0 (API level 26). All markets other than China were still vulnerable as of the latest 
build available on Asusâ€™ website17 that allows the downloading of historical firmwares.

4.5 Oppo F5 Command Execution as the system User 
The Oppo F5 Android device contains a platform app with a package name of com.dropboxchmod that 
executes as the system user. The Oppo F5 device we examined had a build fingerprint of 
OPPO/CPH1723/CPH1723:7.1.1/N6F26Q/1513597833:user/release-keys. Interestingly, the Oppo F5 
does not come with the Dropbox Android app pre-installed with a standard package name of 
com.dropbox.android, although this could also be for the DropBoxService in the Android framework. 
The com.dropboxchmod app contains only a single application component named DropboxChmodService. 
This service app component is implemented by a single class and an anonymous class. Below is the 
AndroidManifest.xml of the app showing that the app has an android:sharedUserId attribute with a 
value of android.uid.system. In addition, the manifest shows that the DropBoxChmodService is 
explicitly exported and not permission-protected, making it accessible to any app on the device.

The primary class named DropBoxChmodService creates an anonymous thread object that has access to the 
intent that was received in the onStartCommand(Intent, int, int) lifecycle method. These anonymous 
thread objects will obtain the action string from the intent and execute it as the system user if the action 
string is not null and not an empty string. Since the DropBoxChmodService app component is exported and 
not permission-protected, any app co-located on the device can execute commands as the system user. 
Unlike the others, the DropBoxChmodService does not print the output of the executed command to the 
logcat log, although the approach detailed in Section 4.1.1 can be used to obtain the output of a command. 
Below is the code to execute as the system user on the Oppo F5 device where the action string to the intent
