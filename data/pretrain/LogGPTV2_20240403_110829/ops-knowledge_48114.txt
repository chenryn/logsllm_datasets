User: How to implement online audio and video live streaming services based on Internet technology?
Assistant: 1. Choose a suitable streaming media server To build a live broadcast service, a streaming media server is required. Commonly used ones include Wowza, FMS, NGINX-RTMP, etc. Choose a streaming server that suits you according to your needs and budget. 2. Prepare audio and video data Live broadcast requires audio and video data, such as collection, encoding, and packaging. Common devices include cameras, microphones, etc. For those who lack hardware devices, you can consider using a mobile phone or computer with a built-in camera and microphone. 3. Use an encoder to encode audio and video data into a streaming format Audio and video data needs to be encoded to convert it into a format that supports streaming media transmission, such as H.264 video encoding and AAC audio encoding. 4. Upload streaming media data to the server Upload the encoded audio and video data from the client to the server through the streaming protocol. FMS and RTMP protocols are often used for streaming. 5. Set the video player Use the video player to play the live content, you can use HTML5 video tag, Flash video player, H5Player, etc. 6. Provide the page to watch the live broadcast Provide the page and link for watching the live broadcast, and users can watch the live broadcast on this page. Tools such as H5Player and JWPlayer can be used for web page embedding. 7. Set the permission to watch the live broadcast If you need to control the permission to watch the live broadcast, you can set the corresponding permission control on the server, and pass the key information to the player for verification. 8. Monitor server status Monitor server status to ensure the stability and performance of streaming media servers. It can be monitored using open source tools such as Zabbix. 9. Provide the playback service after the live broadcast. You can use the storage service to store the live content and provide the playback service. The playback service requires video transcoding to convert the video into various video formats to meet the needs of various terminals.
