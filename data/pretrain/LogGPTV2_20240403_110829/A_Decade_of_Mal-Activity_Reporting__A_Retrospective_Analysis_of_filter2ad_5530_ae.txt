A BLACKLIST-07-17
This section contains supplementary material about Blacklist-07-17
(cf. Section 2.1).
A.1 Blacklist Summary
Our seed blacklists are summarized in Table 5. The majority of the
seed lists (15 out 22) provided sufficiently rich information includ-
ing timestamps of the reported mal-activities, URLs and domains
considered to be malicious, the corresponding IP address and a
free form labels of the mal-activity being reported (e.g., “PayPal
Phishing” and “Cryptowall Ransomware C&C”) describing the type
of mal-activity (phishing, exploit, botnet, etc.). Many of these lists
included additional information about the autonomous system num-
ber (ASN) and partial geolocation information (e.g., MDL [15] and
Malc0de [14]). The remaining 7 sources (e.g., 360Mirai [1]) reported
timestamps and IP addresses only.
B MAL-ACTIVITY CLASSIFICATION
In Section 2.4, we introduced six types of mal-activities, here we
provide their extended definitions.
Exploits. Exploits take advantage of vulnerabilities in software, as
either private or public knowledge, to (remotely) execute code on
the victim’s system. Exploit kits are usually used as a first stage
“dropper” to facilitate the installation of the final payload (i.e., mal-
ware).
Malware. This includes domains and IP addresses that have been
reported to distribute malicious payloads such as Trojans, viruses,
worms, and ransomware.
Fraudulent Services (FS). Domains and IP addresses engaged in the
distribution or provisioning of bogus or fraudulent services or
applications such as the promotion of comments, likes, ratings,
votes or any variations thereof [37, 39, 44].
Spammers. This class contains domains and IP addresses that are
reported to host spam-bots to perform astroturfing/grass roots
marketing [59] or to send large-scale, unsolicited emails or instant
messages.
Phishing. This is composed of domains/IPs reported to host content
aimed at obtaining sensitive information by disguising as trustwor-
thy online services.
Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP). PUP includes domains or
IP addresses involved in distributing bogus software such as free
screen-savers or fake AV scanners that surreptitiously generate
advertisements or perform redirection to collect user credentials or
personal identifiable information.
