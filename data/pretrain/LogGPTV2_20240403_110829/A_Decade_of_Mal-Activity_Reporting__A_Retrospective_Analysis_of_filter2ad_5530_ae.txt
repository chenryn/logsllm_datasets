### Supplementary Material: Blacklist-07-17
#### A.1 Blacklist Summary
Our seed blacklists, summarized in Table 5, provide rich information including timestamps, URLs, domains, IP addresses, and labels describing the type of malicious activity. Most lists (15 out of 22) include detailed information such as autonomous system numbers (ASNs) and partial geolocation data. The remaining seven sources (e.g., 360Mirai [1]) report only timestamps and IP addresses.

### Mal-Activity Classification
In Section 2.4, we introduced six types of mal-activities. Here are their extended definitions:

1. **Exploits**: These take advantage of vulnerabilities in software, either private or public, to execute code remotely on the victim's system. Exploit kits often serve as initial droppers to install the final payload (malware).

2. **Malware**: This includes domains and IP addresses that distribute malicious payloads such as Trojans, viruses, worms, and ransomware.

3. **Fraudulent Services (FS)**: Domains and IP addresses engaged in the distribution or provisioning of bogus or fraudulent services, such as promoting comments, likes, ratings, or votes.

4. **Spammers**: Domains and IP addresses that host spam-bots for astroturfing/grassroots marketing or send large-scale, unsolicited emails or instant messages.

5. **Phishing**: Domains/IPs that host content aimed at obtaining sensitive information by disguising as trustworthy online services.

6. **Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP)**: Domains or IP addresses involved in distributing bogus software, such as free screen-savers or fake antivirus scanners, that generate advertisements or collect user credentials and personal identifiable information.
