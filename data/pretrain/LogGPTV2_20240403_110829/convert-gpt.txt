convert gpt
Converts an empty basic disk with the master boot record (MBR) partition style into a basic disk with the GUID partition table (GPT) partition style. A basic MBR disk must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the select disk command to select a basic disk and shift the focus to it.
Important
The disk must be empty to convert it to a basic disk. Back up your data, and then delete all partitions or volumes before converting the disk. The required minimum disk size for conversion to GPT is 128 megabytes.
