### Convert Disk to GPT

This command converts an empty basic disk with the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition style into a basic disk with the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partition style. The selected disk must be a basic MBR disk for this operation to succeed. Use the `select disk` command to choose and focus on the desired basic disk.

#### Important Notes
- **Empty Disk Requirement**: The disk must be empty to convert it to GPT. Ensure you back up your data and delete all partitions or volumes before proceeding.
- **Minimum Disk Size**: The disk must be at least 128 megabytes in size to be converted to GPT.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
convert gpt [noerr]
```

#### Parameters
- **noerr**:
  - **Description**: For scripting purposes only. If an error is encountered, DiskPart will continue processing commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

#### Examples
To convert a basic MBR disk to GPT, use the following command:
```plaintext
convert gpt
```
