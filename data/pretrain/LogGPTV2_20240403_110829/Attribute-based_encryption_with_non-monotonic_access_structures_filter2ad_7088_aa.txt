ABSTRACT
We construct an Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) scheme
that allows a user’s private key to be expressed in terms of
any access formula over attributes. Previous ABE schemes
were limited to expressing only monotonic access structures.
We provide a proof of security for our scheme based on the
Decisional Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman (BDH) assumption. Fur-
thermore, the performance of our new scheme compares fa-
vorably with existing, less-expressive schemes.

INTRODUCTION
Several distributed ﬁle and information systems require
complex access-control mechanisms, where access decisions
depend upon attributes of the protected data and access
policies assigned to users. Traditionally, such access-control
mechanisms have been enforced by a server that acts as a
trusted reference monitor; the monitor will allow a user to
view data only if his access policy allows it. While the use of
trusted servers allows for a relatively straightforward solu-
tion, there is a large downside to this approach — both the
servers and their storage must be trusted and remain uncom-
promised. With the increasing number of worm attacks and
other forms of intrusion, maintaining the security of any par-
ticular host is becoming increasingly diﬃcult. This problem
is exacerbated in larger systems where sensitive data must

be replicated across several servers because of scalability and
survivability concerns.
A natural solution to this problem is to encrypt stored
data in order to reduce data vulnerability in the event that a
storage server is compromised. However, traditional public-
key encryption methods require that data be encrypted to
one particular user’s public key and are unsuitable for ex-
pressing more complex access control policies.1
Attribute-Based Encryption. Recently, Sahai and Wa-
ters [21] addressed this issue by introducing the concept of
Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). In an ABE systems an
encryptor will associate encrypted data with a set of at-
tributes. An authority with access to the master keys will
issue users diﬀerent private keys, where a user’s private key
is associated with an access structure over attributes and re-
ﬂects the access policy ascribed to the user. The decryption
algorithm allows users to decrypt data using their ascribed
private key as long as their access policy speciﬁed by their
private key permits it.
The original ABE construction of Sahai and Waters is
somewhat limited in that it only permits an authority to
issue private keys that express threshold access policies, in
which a certain number of speciﬁed attributes need to be
present in the ciphertext in order for a user to decrypt.
Goyal et al. [16] greatly increased the expressibility of
Attribute-Based Encryption systems by creating a new ABE
scheme in which users’ private keys can express any mono-
tone access formula consisting of AND, OR, or threshold
gates.
While the work of Goyal et al. is a large step forward in
the capability of Attribute-Based Encryption systems, one
fundamental limitation of their techniques is that there is
no satisfactory method to represent negative constraints in
a key’s access formula. This is particularly a problem in sce-
narios where conﬂicts of interest naturally arise. Consider
the following example. A university is conducting a peer-
review evaluation, where each department will be critiqued
by a panel of professors from other departments. Bob, who
is a member of the panel this year from the Biology de-
partment, will need to read (possibly sensitive) comments
1There have been several proposals for achieving greater
access control from public key systems (see, e.g. [24, 9]).
However, these systems were unable to achieve the critical
property of security against collusion attacks, where multi-
ple users share their private key information. Indeed, simple
and devastating collusion attacks are easy to mount against
the systems of
[24, 9] involving as few as two colluding
users.
In this paper, we focus only on solutions that are
able to provide security against collusion attacks.

ten review. In an Attribute-Based Encryption system the
comments will be labeled with descriptive attributes; for
example, a comment on the History department might be
encrypted with the attributes: “History”,“year=2007”,
“dept-review”.
scheme Bob might
receive a private key for the policy “year=2007” AND
“dept-review”, which would allow him to see all comments
from this current year. However, in this setting it is impor-
tant that Bob should not be able to view comments written
about his own department. Therefore, the policy we would
actually like to ascribe to Bob’s key is “year=2007” AND
“dept-review” AND (NOT “Biology”).
In the Goyal et al.
One way that we might try to handle this issue is to
include explicit attributes that indicate the absence of at-
tributes in the ciphertext. For example, the attribute
“not:Biology” can be included in a ciphertext to indicate
that the ciphertext is not related to the Biology department.
However, this solution is undesirable for two reasons. First,
the ciphertext overhead will become huge in many applica-
tions as it needs to explicitly include negative attributes for
everything that it does not relate to. The feedback about
the History department would need to include the attributes
“not:Aeronautics”, “not:Anthropology”, “not:Art”,
. . . , “not:World Studies” as well as explicit negative at-
tributes for every subject that does not describe the cipher-
text. In addition, a user encrypting a message might not be
aware of many attributes, and new attributes might come
into use in the system after the ciphertext is created. In our
example, a user creating a comment on the History depart-
ment might be unaware of a newly created Otolaryngology2
department.
The above example illustrates the limitations on system
design imposed by the inability of current ABE systems to
eﬀectively support negation. Indeed, this limitation appears
to be a fundamental characteristic of current ABE systems,
which use techniques from secret-sharing schemes as a core
component of their design.
It is well known that secret-
sharing schemes are limited to expressing monotonic access
structures because a participating party can always choose
not to contribute his share and therefore act like he is not
present.
Our Contribution.
In this work we present a new Attribute-Based Encryption
scheme where private keys can represent any access formula
over attributes, including non-monotone ones. In particular,
our construction can handle any access structure that can
be represented by a boolean formula involving AND, OR,
NOT, and threshold operations.
As mentioned above, the main technical obstacle we over-
come is ﬁnding a way to make use of secret sharing schemes
to yield non-monotonic access structures. At a high level,
the technical novelty in our work lies in ﬁnding a way to
(implicitly) make a share “available” to the decryptor only
if a given attribute is not present among the attributes of
the ciphertext. To accomplish this we adapt an idea from
the broadcast revocation scheme of Naor and Pinkas [18] to
our setting of Attribute-Based Encryption based on bilinear
groups. Every negative attribute node in a key is tied to

a degree d polynomial (in the exponent) that was created
by the authority at setup (where d is the maximum num-
ber of attributes used to describe a ciphertext). To access
the secret share corresponding to this node, the decryptor
will need to make use of at least d + 1 diﬀerent points from
the polynomial in order to perform an interpolation, where
we map attributes to distinct points on the polynomial. The
decryption algorithm will be able to gather d diﬀerent points
of the polynomial from the attributes of the ciphertext. To
get the remaining point, the decryptor must examine the
one point that corresponds to the negative attribute in this
particular node of the access formula. If this attribute is dis-
tinct from all the attributes in the ciphertext — that is, if
the attribute is not present — then the decryptor will have
d + 1 points of the polynomial and be able to decrypt; oth-
erwise, if the key’s attribute appears in the ciphertext, then
the decryption algorithm will have only d points (one par-
ticular point will have been given twice) and the decryption
algorithm will not be able to interpolate the polynomial and
thereby access the secret share corresponding to the node.
In designing our construction several challenges arise from
adapting these negation techniques while preserving the col-
lusion resistance features that are necessary for Attribute-
Based Encryption systems.
1.1 Related Work
Sahai and Waters [21] introduced the concept of Attribute-
Based Encryption, as we use the term here (see below for
a brief discussion of other related notions).
In ABE sys-
tems an encrypted ciphertext is associated with a set of
attributes, and a user’s private key will reﬂect an access
policy over attributes. A user will be able to decrypt if and
only if the ciphertext’s attributes satisfy the key’s policy.
Attribute-Based Encryption is closely related to the concept
of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) [7, 23, 15], which was
introduced by Shamir in 1984 [23]. One can actually view
IBE as a special case of ABE in which ciphertexts are associ-
ated with one attribute, the “identity” of the recipient, and a
private key’s policy demands that one particular attribute,
the key holder’s identity, be present in the ciphertext for
decryption.
The original construction of Sahai and Waters [21] was
limited to expressing threshold access policies. Goyal et
al. [16] subsequently increased the expressibility of ABE sys-
tems by allowing the private key to express any monotonic
access structure over attributes.
Other works have examined diﬀerent variants of ABE. Pir-
retti et al. [19] examined methods for applying the Sahai-
Waters system into practice and gave an implementation of
the construction. Chase [13] gave a “multi-authority” con-
struction in which a user’s key is constructed by combin-
ing components received from diﬀerent authorities. Bethen-
court, Sahai, and Waters [4] gave a construction for
“Ciphertext-Policy” Attribute-Based Encryption.
In their
construction the roles of the ciphertexts and keys are re-
versed in the sense that attributes are used to describe the
features of a key holder, and an encryptor will associate an
access policy with the ciphertext.
Attribute-Based Encryption makes use of techniques from
secret-sharing schemes [17, 10, 22, 5, 3]. The idea of combin-
ing secret-sharing schemes and encryption to achieve access
control with respect to policies has a long history (for some
recent work in this direction, see [24, 9]). In this previous
work, what we call “collusion” was actually seen as a de-
sirable feature – it would be necessary for multiple entities
with diﬀerent attributes/credentials to come together in or-
der to access encrypted data. This is of course problematic
in our scenario; indeed, the elusive property of resistance
to collusion attacks is considered a deﬁning property of the
Sahai-Waters notion of ABE.
1.2 Organization
In Section 2 we give background information on our se-
curity deﬁnitions and assumptions. Next, we give our con-
struction in Section 3. Then, we prove our scheme secure in
Section 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.
2. BACKGROUND
We ﬁrst give formal deﬁnitions for the security of (key-
policy) Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), following [21,
16]. Then we give background information on bilinear maps
and our cryptographic assumption. Finally, we give some
background on linear secret-sharing schemes.

Definition 1
(Access Structure [2]). Let {P1, . . .,
Pn} be a set of parties. A collection A ⊆ 2{P1,...,Pn} is mono-
tone if ∀B, C : if B ∈ A and B ⊆ C then C ∈ A. An access
structure (respectively, monotonic access structure) is a col-
lection (respectively, monotone collection) A of non-empty
subsets of {P1, P2, . . . , Pn}, i.e., A ⊆ 2{P1,P2,...,Pn}\{∅}. The
sets in A are called the authorized sets, and the sets not in
A are called the unauthorized sets.
