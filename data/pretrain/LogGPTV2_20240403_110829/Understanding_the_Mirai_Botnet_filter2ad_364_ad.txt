### Analysis of Infected Devices

Mirai primarily targeted IP cameras, DVRs, and consumer routers. However, the actual breakdown of infected devices in the wild may differ from the intended targets. We used Censys to collect device banners and determine the models and manufacturers of infected devices. Our results across all five protocols (Telnet, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and CWMP) indicate that security cameras, DVRs, and consumer routers represent the majority of Mirai infections.

### Longitudinal Analysis

Our longitudinal analysis of the top device vendors indicates modest stability, with a few notable exceptions. During the rapid growth phase in mid-September 2016 and the onset of CWMP in late November 2016, there were significant changes in the composition of infected devices. For example, during the rapid growth phase, consumer routers manufactured by ASUS, Netgear, and Zhone replaced D-Link routers and Controlbr DVRs in the top 20 devices. Dahua, Huawei, ZyXEL, and ZTE devices consistently remained in the top 20.

### Security Implications

Our data indicates that many of the world's top manufacturers of consumer electronics lacked sufficient security practices to mitigate threats like Mirai. These manufacturers will play a key role in ameliorating vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, the wide variety of devices spanned multiple countries and legal jurisdictions, making it challenging to coordinate technical fixes and implement new policies to safeguard consumers in the future.

### Bandwidth Analysis

To further confirm the composition of embedded devices, we examined the bandwidth of infected devices based on their scan rate. Starting with the observed scanning rate and volume on our network telescope, we extrapolated across the entire IPv4 Internet by factoring in the size of our network telescope (4.7 million IPs) and the size of Miraiâ€™s default IP blacklist (340.2 million IPs). We found that about half of the Mirai bots that scanned our network telescope sent fewer than 10,000 scan packets. Additionally, the majority of bots scanned at an estimated rate below 250 bytes per second. This is a strict underestimate, as Mirai may have interrupted scanning to process C2 commands and conduct brute force login attempts. In contrast, SQL Slammer scanned at a rate of 1.5 megabytes/second.
