Table 5: Default Passwords—The 09/30/2016 Mirai source release included 46 unique passwords, some of which were traceable to
a device vendor and device type. Mirai primarily targeted IP cameras, DVRs, and consumer routers.
about underlying software (e.g., “postgres”) and not an as-
sociated device. The devices we identiﬁed were primarily
network-attached storage appliances, home routers, cam-
eras, DVRs, printers, and TV receivers made by dozens
of different manufacturers (Table 5).
Mirai’s intended targets do not necessarily reﬂect the
breakdown of infected devices in the wild. We leveraged
the device banners collected by Censys to determine the
models and manufacturers of infected devices. Our results
across all ﬁve protocols indicate that security cameras,
DVRs, and consumer routers represent the majority of
Mirai infections (Table 6). The manufacturers responsi-
ble for the most infected devices we could identify are:
Dahua, Huawei, ZTE, Cisco, ZyXEL, and MikroTik (Ta-
ble 7).
We note that these results deviate from initial media
reports, which stated that Mirai was predominantly com-
posed of DVRs and cameras [34,53,60]. This is likely due
to the evolution of the Mirai malware over time, which
changed the composition of infected devices. Looking at
the longitudinal Pearson correlation of top device vendors,
we observe modest stability with the exception of two
event periods: the rapid growth phase in mid-September
2016 and the onset of CWMP in late November 2016
(Figure 5b). During the rapid growth, the emergence of
consumer routers manufactured by ASUS, Netgear, and
Zhone supplanted D-Link routers and Controlbr DVRs
in the top 20 devices. Dahua, Huawei, ZyXEL, and ZTE
devices consistently remained in the Top 20.
Our data indicates that some of the world’s top man-
ufacturers of consumer electronics lacked sufﬁcient se-
curity practices to mitigate threats like Mirai, and these
manufacturers will play a key part in ameliorating vul-
nerability. Unfortunately, as discussed in the previous
section, the menagerie of devices spanned both countries
and legal jurisdictions, exacerbating the challenge of co-
ordinating technical ﬁxes and promulgating new policy to
safeguard consumers in the future.

Table 7: Top Mirai Device Vendors—We list the top vendors of infected Mirai devices labeled by active scanning, as a fraction
of Mirai banners found by Censys. The top vendors across all protocols were primarily camera, router, and embedded device
manufacturers.
4.5 Device Bandwidth
As an additional conﬁrmation of embedded composition,
we examined the bandwidth of infected devices as gleaned
from their scan rate, which is not artiﬁcially rate-limited
by the original source code. Starting with the observed
scanning rate and volume on our network telescope, we
extrapolate across the entire IPv4 Internet by factoring in
the size of our network telescope (4.7 million IPs) and
the size of Mirai’s default IP blacklist (340.2 million IPs).
We found about half of the Mirai bots that scanned our
network telescope sent fewer than 10,000 scan packets
(Figure 6). We further note that the majority of bots
scanned at an estimated rate below 250 bytes per second.
We note however this is a strict underestimate, as Mirai
may have interrupted scanning to process C2 commands
and to conduct brute force login attempts. In contrast,
SQL Slammer scanned at 1.5 megabytes/second, about
