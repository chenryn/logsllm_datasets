Abstract—Decoy routing is a recently proposed approach
for censorship circumvention. It relies on cooperating ISPs in
the middle of
to deploy the so called “decoy
routers” that proxy network trafﬁc from users in the censorship
region. A recent study, published in an award-winning CCS 2012
paper [24], suggested that censors in highly connected countries
like China can easily defeat decoy routing by selecting Internet
routes that do not pass through the decoys. This attack is known
as “routing around decoys” (RAD).
In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the true
costs of the RAD attack, based on actual Internet data. Our
analysis takes into account not just the Internet topology, but also
business relationships between ISPs, monetary and performance
costs of different routes, etc. We demonstrate that even for the
most vulnerable decoy placement assumed in the RAD study, the
attack is likely to impose tremendous costs on the censoring ISPs.
They will be forced to switch to much more costly routes and
suffer from degradation in the quality of service.
We then demonstrate that a more strategic placement of
decoys will further increase the censors’ costs and render the
RAD attack ineffective. We also show that the attack is even
less feasible for censors in countries that are not as connected as
China since they have many fewer routes to choose from.
The ﬁrst lesson of our study is that defeating decoy routing
by simply selecting alternative Internet routes is likely to be
prohibitively expensive for the censors. The second, even more
important lesson is that a ﬁne-grained, data-driven approach is
necessary for understanding the true costs of various route selec-
tion mechanisms. Analyses based solely on the graph topology of
the Internet may lead to mistaken conclusions about the feasibility
of decoy routing and other censorship circumvention techniques
based on interdomain routing.

INTRODUCTION
With recent advances in censorship technologies, evading
censorship is becoming more challenging. New circumvention
systems aim to make their trafﬁc unobservable in order to (1)
protect their users, and (2) prevent their services from being

blocked by censors. Decoy routing is a new approach to un-
observable censorship circumvention, proposed independently
in systems called DR [17], Telex [26], and Cirripede [15]. In
contrast to traditional circumvention tools in which circumven-
tion proxies run on end-host servers, decoy routing places these
proxies—called decoy routers—at the routers of volunteer ISPs
(in the rest of this paper, we will use the terms ISP and
“autonomous system” interchangeably). To use a decoy routing
system, a client connects to a non-blocked destination via a
route containing a decoy router; the decoy router acts as a
man-in-the-middle for the connection and proxies the trafﬁc
to the blocked destinations requested by the client.
Schuchard et al. [24] proposed the “routing around de-
coys” attack against decoy routing. In the rest of this paper,
we will use the terms “RAD attack” and “RAD paper” to
refer, respectively, to this attack and the paper in which it was
published. The basis of the RAD attack is the observation that
ISPs in the censorship region are likely to have multiple paths
to any given destination. Therefore, censors can instruct the
ISPs under their inﬂuence to exclusively select routes that do
not pass through the ISPs known to deploy decoy routers.
The RAD attack is considered successful only if it manages
to avoid the decoys while (mostly) maintaining the connectiv-
ity of the censoring ISPs to the rest of the Internet. Schuchard
et al. analyze the Internet topology and show that—assuming
that
the decoy routers are placed in a small number of
randomly selected autonomous systems—the RAD attack will
maintain the censors’ connectivity.
Our contributions. In this paper, we take a closer look at the
true costs of the RAD attack. We start by estimating the quality
of the alternative routes selected by the RAD adversary, as
opposed to their mere existence. In this analysis, we make the
same random placement assumption as the RAD paper, even
though it is heavily biased in favor of the RAD adversary (a
random autonomous system is unlikely to transit others’ trafﬁc,
thus placing decoy routers in it serves little purpose).
The short summary of our ﬁndings is that the RAD attack
is likely to impose huge monetary and performance costs on
the censoring ISPs. The RAD paper observes that if decoy
routers are placed at 2% of all autonomous systems, China—by
far the easiest case for the RAD attack due to its high
connectivity—would get disconnected only from 4% of the
Internet [24, Fig. 2a]. While true, this is not the whole story.
Our simulations show that:
• On average, the estimated latency of China’s Internet routes
will increase by a factor of 8.
• 44 of China’s customer autonomous systems will have
to become “transit” autonomous systems, requiring vast
re-organization and investment
in their network infras-
tructure. By comparison, China today has only 30 transit
autonomous systems.
• There will be dramatic changes in loads on China’s transit
autonomous systems. For example, transit loads will in-
crease by a factor of 2800 for one autonomous system,
while decreasing by 32% for another.
• 39% of China’s Internet routes will become longer; 12%
will become more expensive.
A more strategic placement of decoy routers further am-
pliﬁes the censors’ costs, even in terms of basic Internet con-
nectivity. If decoy routers are placed in 2% of all autonomous
systems, but the systems are chosen strategically rather than
randomly, China will be disconnected from 30% of all Internet
destinations, not 4% as calculated in the RAD paper.
We also analyze the feasibility of the RAD attack for other
state-level censors. As intuitively expected, the costs of the
RAD attack depend on the censoring country’s network infras-
tructure. Countries with less connectivity in the global Internet
graph incur higher costs. For instance, a RAD attack against
decoy routers strategically placed in 1% of all autonomous
systems will disconnect China from 18% of all Internet des-
tinations, whereas Venezuela and Syria will be disconnected
from 54% and 87% of all destinations, respectively.
In addition to showing that “routing around decoys” is
likely to be very costly, our study provides several lessons and
recommendations. An important methodological lesson is that,
when analyzing the feasibility and costs of attacks and defenses
based on Internet routing, it is not enough to simply look at
the topology of the Internet graph. The edges in this graph are
not all equal, they have vastly different costs and performance
characteristics. Relationships between autonomous systems,
such as customer-provider, peer, etc., matter a lot. Therefore,
any analysis of decoy routing and alternatives must be based
on all available ﬁne-grained data about individual nodes and
edges in the Internet graph.
Organization. In Section II, we provide background informa-
tion on the Internet ASes, decoy routing, and the RAD attack.
In Section III, we describe how the RAD attack works. In

censors to carry out a RAD attack. In Section V, we suggest
strategic decoy placements. In Section VI, we describe our data

recommendations in Section VIII.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Internet topology
The Internet is a globally distributed network composed of
more than 44, 000 [3] autonomous systems. An autonomous
system (AS) is “a connected group of one or more IP preﬁxes
run by one or more network operators which has a single and
clearly deﬁned routing policy” [14].
While the details of business agreements between ASes
can be complex, the widely accepted Gao model [11] ab-

tomer cone size, which is 22,664, is not shown).
stracts business relationships into the following three main
types [1]:
• Customer-to-provider (c2p): An AS A is a customer of
a connected neighbor AS B (the provider) if A pays B
to transit A’s trafﬁc to Internet destinations that A cannot
reach otherwise. Similarly, B has a provider-to-customer
(p2c) relationship with A.
• Peer-to-peer (p2p): Two ASes are peers if they exchange
Internet trafﬁc between each other and each other’s cus-
tomers free of charge, due to a mutual business agreement.
• Sibling-to-sibling (s2s): Two ASes are siblings if they
belong to the same organization. Sibling ASes do not
charge each other for the transit trafﬁc.
Figure 1 illustrates these relationships.
An AS’s customer cone includes the AS itself plus all
ASes that can be reached from that AS through provider-to-
customer links.1 In other words, A’s customer cone includes A,
A’s customers, A’s customers’ customers, and so on. Figure 2
shows the CDF of customer cone size for all 44,064 Internet
ASes.
An edge AS is an AS whose customer cone has size 1, i.e.,
it has no customers. A transit AS is an AS whose customer
cone is greater than 1, i.e., it transits other ASes’ trafﬁc to the
rest of the Internet.
Internet routes are based on paths between ASes (inter-

domain routes) which are established via BGP, the Border
Gateway Protocol [22]. A path is a sequence of neighbor ASes
that connect the source AS to the destination AS in the Internet
topology graph. A path is valid if, for every transit AS on the
path, there exists a customer [1] who is its immediate neighbor.
A path is invalid if at least one transit AS is not paid by a
neighbor in the path [1, 10]. Valid paths are also referred to
as valley-free (VF). Correspondingly, we refer to invalid paths
as non-valley-free (NVF). Figure 3 shows examples of valid
and invalid paths.
Valley-freeness is not a requirement of the BGP protocol,
i.e., BGP routers are technically able to advertise NVF paths.
However, as described above, a NVF path will impose unde-
sired monetary costs on some transit ISP because it will not
earn money (or may even have to pay money) for transiting
the trafﬁc of another ISP. Therefore, ISPs widely refrain from
advertising NVF paths.
B. Decoy routing
Decoy routing is a new architecture for censorship cir-
cumvention which was proposed in three independent works:
DR [17], Telex [26], and Cirripede [15]. In contrast to tra-
ditional circumvention techniques [2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 20, 25]
that operate on computer servers located outside censorship
regions, decoy routing systems are deployed on a number of
routers in the middle of the Internet, called decoy routers, by
ASes that we refer to as decoy ASes. Instead of making direct
connections to the circumvention endpoints, e.g., proxies, a
decoy routing client makes a TLS [6] connection to arbitrary,
non-blocked Internet destinations, known as overt destinations.
The client selects overt destinations so that
the routes to
these destinations pass through decoy routers and stegano-
graphically signals the decoy router to treat these connections
as circumvention connections. The decoy router intercepts
the client’s trafﬁc and proxies the connection to the covert
destination requested by the client. To a censor observing the
client’s trafﬁc, the client appears to be communicating with
a non-blocked, overt destination, while the client is actually
communicating with a forbidden, covert destination.
In DR [17] and Telex [26], the decoy router itself proxies
covert connections, whereas in Cirripede [15] decoy routers
deﬂect the trafﬁc to external proxies. Also, while Telex and
Cirripede require clients to probe for overt destinations that
happen to have decoy routers on routes leading to them,
DR assumes that clients obtain the secret locations of decoy
routers through out-of-band channels. The proposed decoy
routing designs also use different signaling techniques: Cirri-
pede uses the initial sequence number of the TLS connection,
whereas Telex uses the TLS nonce. Further details on the
design of decoy routing systems can be found in the original
papers [15, 17, 26].
How to select ASes for decoy placement has been studied
in three papers. Houmansadr et al. [15] and Cesareo et al. [4]
analyzed the placement of decoy routers in a non-adversarial
setting, while Schuchard et al. [24] analyzed the placement of
decoy routers in the presence of a censor capable of changing
routing decisions—see Section II-C.
C. Routing around decoys (RAD)
[24]
Schuchard et al.
introduced the “routing around
decoys” (RAD) attack against decoy routing systems. The
RAD attack is conducted by a routing-capable adversary,
i.e., a censoring regime who can modify the standard routing
decisions of the ISPs under its inﬂuence in order to ensure that
their Internet trafﬁc does not pass through any decoy ASes.
The ASes controlled by a RAD adversary discard all BGP
paths that contain even one decoy AS and choose alternative,
decoy-free paths. In order to launch the RAD attack, the RAD
adversary needs to know which ASes deploy decoy routers.
This can be done, for example, via probing schemes proposed
in the RAD paper.
The main intuition behind the RAD attack is as follows.
For any given source and destination, the Internet topology
is likely to provide multiple interdomain paths. Consequently,
a RAD adversary can compel its ASes to avoid paths that
contain decoy ASes without sacriﬁcing much of its Internet
connectivity. If censorship results in a signiﬁcant
loss or
degradation of Internet connectivity in the censorship region, it
causes signiﬁcant collateral damage and is less likely to be in
the censors’ interest. Therefore, the RAD attack is considered
successful only if the RAD adversary can avoid all decoy ASes
while maintaining its connectivity with most of the Internet.
To improve the RAD adversary’s connectivity, the RAD
paper assumes that the ASes under the adversary’s control
share interdomain paths with each other regardless of their
business relations. In other words, an AS controlled by a RAD
adversary can use the paths known to any other AS controlled
by the same RAD adversary.
The RAD paper considers several censoring regimes as
possible RAD adversaries, including China, Iran, and Syria.
As the RAD paper suggests, China is the most powerful RAD
adversary due to its signiﬁcant connectivity.
III.
INTERDOMAIN ROUTING IN RAD
The BGP [22] protocol is the de facto standard used by
ASes to construct interdomain paths. The RAD attack forces
ASes under the RAD adversary’s control to change how they
make BGP routing decisions. We refer to the resulting protocol
as RBGP.2
A. BGP routing
A BGP router maintains a database with the paths to
different Internet destinations and advertises some of these
paths to the routers of the neighbor ASes, as determined by the
ASes’ business relationships (see Section II-A). For instance,
a BGP router of a transit AS advertises all known paths to its
customers’ routers in order to earn money by transiting their
trafﬁc. On the other hand, a BGP router should not advertise
its paths to the provider ASes, otherwise the AS that owns the
router would end up paying its providers for transiting their
trafﬁc (such paths are NVF, as explained in Section II-A).
A BGP router is likely to know multiple paths to a given
Internet destination (identiﬁed by its IP address preﬁx). BGP
2The name should not be confused with the R-BGP protocol of Kushman
et al. [18].

routers use a list of decision factors, shown in Table I, to
identify the best path. These factors are applied in order, with
each factor ﬁltering out the set of paths left by the previously
applied factor. For example, the B2 factor is applied only to the
paths that are considered best according to the B1 factor. The
router applies the factors until only one path remains, i.e., the
best path. For instance, suppose that for a certain destination
a BGP router knows four paths, two of which pass through
its provider neighbors and the other two pass through its peer
neighbors (we explain the difference between providers and
peers in Section II-A). In this case, the B3 factor ﬁlters out
the two paths that route through providers, and the B4 factor
is applied only to the two paths that route through peers.
We only focus on two of the decision factors from Table I
since they are highly inﬂuenced by the RAD attack. The
