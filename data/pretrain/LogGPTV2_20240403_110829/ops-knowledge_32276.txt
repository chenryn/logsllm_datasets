User: I have a script that I found on the internet that worked in Python 3.4, but not Python 3.5. I'm not too familiar in python, but it has the 

#!/usr/bin/env python3

schlebang at the top of the file. And it also throws this exception when I try to run it:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Python isn't really my preferred langage, so I don't know what to do. This is a script that's supposed to access my Gmail account and pull new mails from it. Do you guys have any suggestions? I'm using Arch Linux, if that helps.
Assistant: Variant A:
Run this script as python3.4 /path/to/script
Variant B:
Change the schebang to #!/usr/bin/python3.4
