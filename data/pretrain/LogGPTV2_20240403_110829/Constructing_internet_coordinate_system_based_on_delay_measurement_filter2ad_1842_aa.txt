ABSTRACT
In this paper, we consider the problem of how to represent
the locations of Internet hosts in a Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem to facilitate estimate of the network distance between
two arbitrary Internet hosts. We envision an infrastructure
that consists of beacon nodes and provides the service of es-
timating network distance between two hosts without direct
delay measurement. We show that the principal component
analysis (PCA) technique can eﬀectively extract topologi-
cal information from delay measurements between beacon
hosts. Based on PCA, we devise a transformation method
that projects the distance data space into a new coordinate
system of (much) smaller dimensions. The transformation
retains as much topological information as possible and yet
enables end hosts to easily determine their locations in the
coordinate system. The resulting new coordinate system is
termed as the Internet Coordinate System (ICS). As com-
pared to existing work (e.g., IDMaps [1] and GNP [2]), ICS
incurs smaller computation overhead in calculating the co-
ordinates of hosts and smaller measurement overhead (re-
quired for end hosts to measure their distances to beacon
hosts). Finally, we show via experimentation with real-life
data sets that ICS is robust and accurate, regardless of the
number of beacon nodes (as long as it exceeds certain thresh-
old) and the complexity of network topology.

INTRODUCTION
Discovery of Internet topology has many advantages for
design and deployment of topology sensitive network ser-
vices and applications, such as nearby server selection, over-
lay network construction, routing path construction, and
peer-to-peer computing. The knowledge of network topol-
ogy enables each host in these systems to make better deci-
sions by exploiting its topological relations with other hosts.
For example, in peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing services such as
Napster, Gnutellar, and eDonkey, a client can download
shared ﬁles from a peer that is closer to itself, if the topology
information is available. Among several categories of ap-
proaches to infer network topology, the measurement based
approach may be the most promising, whereby the net-
work topology is constructed by end-to-end measurement
of network properties, such as bandwidth, round-trip time,
and packet loss rate. In this paper, we focus on topology
construction based on end-to-end delay (round-trip time)
measurement, and use the term ”network distance” for the
round-trip time between two hosts.
The primary goal of constructing network topology is to
enable estimation of the network distance between arbitrary
hosts without direct measurement between these hosts. Sev-
eral approaches have been proposed among which IDMaps
[1] and GNP [2] may have received the most attention. Both
assume a common architecture that consists of a small num-
ber of well-positioned infrastructure nodes (called beacon
nodes in this paper). Every beacon node measures its dis-
tances to all the other beacon nodes and uses these measure-
ment results to infer the network topology. A host estimates
its distance to the other ordinary hosts by measuring its dis-
tances to beacon nodes (rather than to the other hosts). A
host beneﬁts from using this architecture, as it needs only to
perform a small number of measurements and will be able to
infer its network distance to a large number of hosts (such
as servers).
One important issue in realizing these measurement archi-
tectures is how to represent the location of a host. IDMaps
and Hotz’s triangulation [3, 4], for example, uses the original
distances to beacon nodes to represent the location of a host,
while GNP [2] transforms the original distance data space
into a Cartesian coordinate system and uses coordinates in
the coordinate system to represent the location. As will be
discussed in Section 3, the major advantage of representing
network distances in a coordinate system is that it enables
extraction of topological information from the measured net-
work distance data. As a result, the accuracy in estimating
the distance between two arbitrary hosts will be improved
especially in the case that the number of beacon nodes is
small. To construct a new coordinate system, GNP formu-
lates an optimization problem that minimizes the diﬀerence
between the measured network distance in the distance data
space and the Euclidean distance in a Cartesian coordinate
system, and applies the Simplex Downhill method to solve
the minimization problem. In spite of its many advantages,
as will be elaborated on in Section 3, GNP does not guar-
antee that a host has a unique coordinate in a Cartesian
coordinate system. Depending on the initial value used in
the Simplex Downhill method, a single host may have dif-
ferent coordinates.
In this paper, we present a new Coordinate system called
the Internet Coordinate System (ICS). The distances from
a host to beacon nodes are expressed as a distance vector,
where the dimension of the distance vector is equal to the
number of beacon nodes. As each beacon node deﬁnes an
axis in the distance data space, the bases may be corre-
lated. We apply the principal component analysis (PCA)
to projects the distance data space into a new, uncorre-
lated and orthogonal Cartesian coordinate system of (much)
smaller dimensions. The linear transformation essentially
extracts topology information from delay measurements be-
tween beacon nodes and retains it in a new coordinate sys-
tem. By taking the ﬁrst several principal components (ob-
tained in PCA) as the bases, we can construct the Cartesian
coordinate system of smaller dimensions while retaining as
much topology information as possible.
Based on the PCA-derived Cartesian coordinate system,
we then propose a method to estimate the network distance
between arbitrary hosts on the Internet. The network dis-
tances between beacon nodes are ﬁrst analyzed to retrieve
the principal components. The ﬁrst several components are
scaled by a factor (such that the Euclidean distances in the
new coordinate system approximate the measured distances)
and used as the new bases in the coordinate system. The
coordinate of a host is then determined by multiplying its
original distance vector to (a subset of) beacon nodes with
the linear transformation matrix. As compared to GNP,
ICS is computationally eﬃcient because it only requires lin-
ear algebra operations. In addition, the location of a host
is uniquely determined in the coordinate system. Another
advantage of ICS is that it incurs smaller measurement over-
head, as it does not require a host to make delay measure-
ment to all the beacon nodes. Instead, a host may measure
its distances only to a subset of beacon nodes. This is es-
pecially desirable in the case that some of the beacon nodes
are not available (due to transient network partition and/or
node failure). Finally, we show via Internet experimentation
with real-life data sets that ICS is robust and accurate, re-
gardless of the number of beacon nodes (as long as it exceeds
certain threshold) and the complexity of network topology.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we provide the preliminary material and deﬁne a distance
coordinate system using linear algebra. In Section 3, we give
a summary of related work in the literature and motivate the
need for a new Coordinate system. In Sections 4–5, we ﬁrst
introduce PCA and then propose the ICS architecture that
enables construction of network topology in a coordinate
system. Following that, we present in Section 6 experimental
results, and conclude the paper in Section 7.
2. PRELIMINARY
The network topology can be modeled in a coordinate
system based on the delay measured between hosts on the
Internet. Each host measures the network distance (i.e., the
round trip delay) to the other hosts using ping or tracer-
oute. Under the assumption that there exist m hosts, a
host Hi has a distance vector di as its coordinate in an m-
dimensional system:
T ,
di = [di1, . . . , dim]
(1)
where dij is the network distance measured by the ith host
to the jth host and dii = 0. In general, dij (cid:4)= dji because
forward and reverse paths may have diﬀerent characteristics.
The overall system is represented by an m-by-m distance
matrix D, whose ith column is the coordinate of host Hi:
(2)
D = [d1, . . . , dm] .
Here D is a non-symmetric square matrix with zero diagonal
entries. This representation is quite simple and intuitive,
but contains too much redundant information as every host
deﬁnes its own dimension in the coordinate system. In this
paper, we will study how to represent network distances
between hosts in a coordinate system of the least possible
dimension, while retaining as much topological information
as possible.
In a coordinate system, the generalized distance metric [6]
is deﬁned as
Lp(di, dj) =
mX
k=1
! 1
p
|dik − djk|p
.
(3)
Some of the most important metrics are the Manhattan dis-
tance L1, the Euclidean distance L2, and the Chebyshev
distance L∞. It has been shown that L∞ can be expressed
as
L∞(di, dj) = lim
p→∞ Lp(di, dj) = max
k
|dik − djk|.
3. RELATED WORK
3.1 Methods in the distance data space
Several methods have been proposed to estimate the dis-
tance between hosts on the Internet. These methods envi-
sion an infrastructure in which servers (beacon nodes) mea-
sure network distances between one another, and a client
hi (ordinary host) infers its distance to some other host hj
based on that distance information between servers. Hotz
deﬁned, for a host A, a distance vector da = [da1, . . . , dam]T
[3], where dai is the measured distance to the ith beacon
node for i ∈ {1, . . . , m} and m is the number of beacon
nodes. Then, the network distance L between hosts A and
B was shown to be bound by:
|dai − dbi| ≤ L ≤ min
i
max
i
(dai + dbi).
(4)
Note that the lower bound is the Chebyshev distance be-
tween the two vectors, da and db. Hotz also showed that the
average of the upper and lower bounds generally gives a bet-
ter estimation of the distance than each bound. Guyton et
al. later applied Hotz’s triangulation to distance calculation
for locating nearby servers on the Internet [4].
A global architecture for estimating Internet host dis-
tances, called the Internet Distance Map Service IDMaps,
was ﬁrst proposed by Francis et al.
[1]. The architecture
separates beacon nodes (called tracers) that collect and dis-
tribute distance information from clients that use the dis-
tance map. Each tracer measures the distances to IP address
preﬁxes (APs) that are close to itself. A client ﬁrst deter-
mines its own AP and the autonomous system (AS) the AP
is connected to. The client then runs a spanning-tree al-
gorithm over the distance information gathered by tracers
to ﬁnd the shortest distance between its AS and the AS
that the AP of the destination belongs to. This distance is
taken as the estimated distance. Methods of this type (i.e.,
methods that represent network distances in a distance data
space) neither analyze delay measurements nor infer network
topology. Consequently, their performance depends heavily
on the number and placement of beacon nodes. If the num-
ber of beacon nodes is small, the measurement performance
may not be good.
In order to extract topological information, Ratnasamy et
al. [7] proposed a binning scheme. A bin is deﬁned as the list
of beacon nodes in the order of increasing delay. The bin of a
host indicates the relative distances to all the beacon nodes.
For example, if the bin of a host is ”babcbb”, beacon node ba
is the closest to the host, and bb is the farthest to the host.
The authors applied the binning scheme to the problems
of constructing overlay networks and selecting servers.
In
the binning scheme, a host joins an overlay network node or
selects a server whose bin is most similar to its own bin.
3.2 Methods that use the Cartesian coordinate
system
Ng et al. proposed a Cartesian coordinate-based approach,
called Global Networking Positioning (GNP) [2]. Instead of
using the original network distances, GNP represents the
location of each host in a N -dimensional Cartesian coordi-
nate system, where N is the number of beacon nodes. The
coordinate of a host is the distances from itself to the bea-
con nodes, and the distance between two hosts is calculated
as the Euclidean distance in the Cartesian coordinate. The
major advantage of representing network distances in a co-
ordinate system is to extract topological information from
the measured network distances. As a result, the accuracy in
estimating the distance between two arbitrary hosts will be
improved especially in the case that the number of beacon
nodes is small.
Two optimization problems have been considered in GNP
in order to obtain the coordinates of beacon nodes and hosts
in the Cartesian coordinate system. The ﬁrst problem ob-
tains the coordinates of beacon nodes in GNP by minimizing
the diﬀerence between the measured distance and the com-
puted distance of any pair of beacon nodes in the Cartesian
coordinate system:
J1 =
˜dij − L2(di, dj)
,
(5)

where ˜dij is the measured distance between the ith and jth
beacon nodes, and di is the coordinate of the ith beacon
node in the Cartesian coordinate system. The second opti-
mization problem determines the coordinate of an ordinary
host H by minimizing the following cost function:
J2 =
˜dhi − L2(di, dh)
,
(6)
i
where ˜dhi is the measured distance between host H and the
ith beacon nodes, and dh is the coordinate of the host H.
GNP tackles both optimization problems using the Simplex
Downhill method [8]. Unfortunately, the Simplex Downhill
method only gives a local minimum that is close to the start-
ing value and does not guarantee that the result is unique
in the case that the cost functions are not (strictly) con-
vex. (The cost functions expressed in Eqs. (5) and (6) are
not strictly convex.) It is stated in [2] that the ﬁrst opti-
mization problem may have an inﬁnite number of solutions,
and any solution is suﬃcient. This implies that the Simplex
Downhill method is used to ﬁnd one of the local minima. If
the solution to the ﬁrst optimization problem is a good ap-
proximation of a global minimum, the coordinates of beacon
nodes thus calculated suﬃce in the ﬁrst problem. A host in
GNP may have diﬀerent coordinates depending on the start-
ing values used in the Simplex Downhill method. However,
this is not the case in the second optimization problem. The
fact that ordinary hosts may have non-unique coordinates
may lead to estimation inaccuracy. We demonstrate the
problem in the following example.
Example 1. Problem with GNP: Consider four hosts,
two of which are located in one autonomous system (AS),
and the other two in another AS. Also assume (for demon-
stration purpose) that the distance between two hosts in the
same AS is 1 while the distance between two hosts in diﬀer-
ent ASs is 3. Then the topology can be expressed using the
following distance matrix D:

• Unlike all the other previous work, a host does not have
to measure its distance to all the beacon nodes, but can
determine its coordinate by measuring the distances
to a subset of beacon nodes. The message overhead is
reduced.
It has come to our attention that Tang et al. also ap-
plied principal component analysis to project distance mea-
surements into a Cartesian coordinate system with smaller
dimensions [5]. The authors considered the coordinate of
a host in the coordinate system as the distances to virtual
landmarks while the coordinate in the distance data space
represents the distances to actual beacon nodes (landmarks).
However, unlike GNP and ICS, the Euclidean distance be-
tween two hosts in this scheme does not approximate the
real round trip time but reﬂects the relative proximity. For
the sake of scalability, the authors also devised a coordinate
exchanging method among multiple coordinate systems.

Figure 1 depicts the cost function J2 with respect to dh1 and
dh2. The cost function has two local minima at (1.2866, -
0.9130) and (-1.3571, 1.9938). Therefore, dh can be either
[1.2866, −0.9130]T or [−1.3571, 1.9938]T depending on the
starting values of the Simplex Downhill method. If the start-
ing value is (1,-1), the Simplex Downhill method renders the
former local minimum (1.2866, -0.9130). This implies that
GNP does not guarantee a unique mapping from the original
