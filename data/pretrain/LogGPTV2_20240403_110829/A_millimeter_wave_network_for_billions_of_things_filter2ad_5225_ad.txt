This expression indicates that the received signal is copied at the
carrier frequency (i.e., at ω0) and at the harmonics of the switches’
control signal (i.e., at mωp). However, only one copy has significant
amplitude and the rest are negligible ( 20-30dB weaker [25]). In
fact, the center frequency of the strongest copy depends on the
direction from which the signal arrives (θ). Therefore, by using
TMA, the signals on the same frequency channel, but arriving from
different directions, will be shifted to different frequency channels.
This enables the AP to simultaneously communicate to multiple
nodes using the same frequency channel.
8 IMPLEMENTATION
mmX’s implementation has two primary components: IoT nodes
and an access point. In the following, we explain the implementation
of each component in more details.
8.1 mmX’s IoT node
The block diagram of the mmX’s nodes is shown in Figure 3, which
includes a mmWave section and a control unit. A Raspberry Pi 3
is used as a control board. We implemented the mmWave section
on a printed circuit board (PCB) using off-the-shelf components,
as shown in Figure 1. The designed mmWave board can be used
as a daughter board for the Raspberry Pi. The data is transferred
from the Raspberry Pi to the mmWave board through the SPI com-
munication port. This will enable robust and real-time data stream
from the Raspberry Pi to the mmWave section. The mmWave board
has two main components: VCO and an RF switch. For the VCO,
we use HMC 533 from Analog Devices [9] which has a wide tun-
able frequency range, covering the entire 24 GHz ISM band. The

in an anechoic chamber. As can be seen in Figure 8, Beam 1 has
a peak at the broadside (θ = 0), and Beam 0 has peaks at ±30o.
Moreover, Beam 0 has a very low magnitude on the main lobe of
the Beam 1 and vice versa. Therefore, the two radiation beams are
orthogonal to each other and create the minimum overlap. The
elevation radiation pattern of each beam is similar to a single patch
antenna (i.e., a wide beam with 3 dB bandwidth of 65o). This allows
the node to work at different height with respect to the AP. The
azimuth 3 dB beamwidth of each beam is 40o. Our results show
that the node’s field of view is 120o in front side of the node, and
the maximum range is 18 m. Note that, depending on the use case,
one can design narrower beams to improve the range at the cost
of narrower field of view. Furthermore, one can easily extend the
node’s field of view to the back side of the node by incorporating
additional patch antennas.
Joint ASK-FSK modulation: Figure 9(a) shows an example of
a measured signal at the AP. As shown in the figure, the signal
can be decoded using ASK demodulation. However, as explained in
Section 6, there is a possibility that the paths for Beam 0 and Beam
1 experiences similar attenuation, and hence, the amplitude of the
carrier signal is the same for bit 0 and bit 1. In this case, the SNR of
the ASK signal will be very low for the AP to decode it. Figure 9(b)
shows an example of a measured signal in such a scenario. Although
our results show that the possibility of this happening is minor (<
10%), mmX addresses this problem by joint ASK-FSK modulation
such that the AP can always decode the signal. As illustrated in
Figure 9(b), the frequency has slightly altered between the bits, and
hence the signal can easily be decoded using FSK demodulation in
this case.
9.2 mmX’s SNR Performance
First, we evaluate the performance of mmX and the OTAM scheme
in enabling robust mmWave links between nodes and AP. We con-
duct experiments in a 6m × 4m room. We place mmX’s AP on one
side of the room and we place a mmX’s node at random locations
and heights. For each location, the orientation of the mmX’s node
(respect to the AP) is randomly picked between -60 and 60 degrees.
We also asked people to walk around. In order to block the sig-
nal, one person was blocking the line-of-sight path between the
node and the AP for the entire duration of the experiment. We
then measured the SNR at the AP for two different scenarios: (1)
without OTAM, in which the mmX’s node utilizes only Beam 1
and transmit an ASK-FSK signal.; (2) with OTAM, in which the
mmX’s node utilizes both beams to create an ASK-FSK signal over
the air, as explained in Section 6. Note that in the first scenario, the
modulation is done at the node while in the second scenario, the
modulation is done over the air.
Figure 10 plots the results of this experiment. The figure shows
the SNR (at the AP) for different node locations in two different
scenarios. Figure 10 (a) indicates that when the node sends the
modulated signal through Beam 1, there are many locations with
SNRs below 5 dB. On the other hand, Figure 10 (b) shows that
for the same locations, when the node uses the OTAM scheme to
modulates the signal over the air, the SNR is significantly improved.
Specifically, with OTAM, mmX achieves SNRs of more than 11 dB

mmX’s hardware platform operates over a wide range of frequency,
covering an entire 24GHz ISM band.
Figure 8: Measured beam patterns of mmX’s node. Beam 0
and Beam 1 are orthogonal to each other (i.e., Beam 0 has a null at
the peak of Beam 1, and Beam 1 has nulls at the peaks of Beam 0).
to slightly vary the frequency in order to perform the joint ASK-FSK
modulation.
The maximum operating frequency of the RF switch is 100 MHz,
which limits the data rate of mmX’s nodes to 100 Mbps. This is
much higher than what most high-data rate applications require.
For example, HD video cameras require only 8-10 Mbps. Finally,
mmX’s node consumes 1.1 W which results in an energy efficiency
of 11nj/bit at 100 Mbps. We believe that mmX’s data rate and energy
efficiency can be further improved by using a faster RF switch or
designing an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).
Node’s Antenna Performance: mmX’s nodes use two orthogo-
nal beams. Figure 8 shows the measured azimuth radiation patterns
of the antenna arrays designed for the node. The antennas are
designed and fabricated on RO4835 substrate and their radiation
patterns are measured by a near field antenna measurement facility

in almost all locations, enabling a very low BER. These results
show that the OTAM scheme significantly improves the link SNR
and enables mmX’s nodes to effectively communicate with the AP
without needing to search for the best beam.
9.3 mmX’s BER Performance
Next, we evaluate the performance of mmX in terms of bit-error-
rate (BER). As in the previous experiment, we measure the SNR
from 30 different locations, heights and orientations of nodes in
the same testbed. Then, we compute the BER by substituting the
SNR measurements into standard BER tables based on the ASK
modulation [43].
Figure 11 shows the CDF of the BER for two scenarios: 1) without
OTAM and 2) with OTAM as described in Section 9.2. The figure
shows that without OTAM, the median and 90th percentile BER
are 10−5 and 0.3, respectively. The figure also shows that OTAM
significantly improves the BER of mmX network. Specifically, with
OTAM, the median and 90th percentile BER are 10−12 and 10−3,
respectively. This physical BER is acceptable for most wireless
applications and it can be reduced even further by using an error
correction coding scheme.
(b) With OTAM
Figure 10: SNR of mmX’s nodes at the AP. SNR of mmX’s nodes
at the mmX’s AP for two different scenarios. (1) without OTAM,
where the node chooses Beam 1 and transmits ASK signal, and (2)
with OTAM, where the node creates ASK signal over the air. The
figure shows that without OTAM, for many cases the SNR is below
5 dB, resulting in a higher bit error rate. In contrast, with OTAM,
mmX achieves SNR of more than 10 dB in all locations
9.4 mmX’s Range Performance
We now explore the impact of distance between the mmX’s node
and AP on the SNR. We measure the SNR of the received signal at
the AP while we change the distance between the AP and the node.
For each location, we run experiments for two different scenarios:
1) the node is facing toward the AP, where the center beam has a
line-of-sight toward the AP, and 2) the node is not facing toward the
AP. Figure 12 shows the results for this experiment. As anticipated,

increasing the distance reduced the SNR. However, even at 18 me-
ters, mmX provides SNRs of more than 15 dB, which is sufficient
to achieve BER of lower than 10−8. The figure also shows that the
SNR slightly degrades when the node does not face toward the AP.
This is expected since the beams are orthogonal, and in this case,
only one arm of the side beam is directed to the AP. However, even
at 18 meters, mmX still achieves SNRs as high as 9 dB. These results
show that mmX provides a robust wireless link even when the AP
and nodes are 18 m far from each other, which is enough to connect
IoT sensors to an access point in a smart home, autonomous cars
and many other IoT applications.

transmitting simultaneously versus their SNR at the AP. mmX
enables robust communication links even when 20 nodes simulta-
neously transmit to a single AP.
9.5 mmX’s Network Performance
So far, we have evaluated the performance of mmX when a sin-
gle node communicates to the AP at any point in time. We now
evaluate the performance of mmX as a network, when multiple
nodes communicate with the AP, simultaneously. We place the AP
in one side of the room, and we place the nodes in random locations
and orientations. We measure the SNR of their signal (at the AP)
while multiple nodes communicate with the AP, simultaneously.
We run 100 experiments. Due to limitations of USRPs, we cannot
capture the entire bandwidth occupied by all nodes, and hence we
do not implement Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM) in hardware.
However, we collect measurements from sub-bands (i.e., 25MHz
occupied by each node), and we combine them in post-processing
in order to simulate the effect of Frequency Division Multiplexing
(FDM) and Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM). Figure 13 shows
the result of this experiment. As the number of nodes which simul-
taneously transmit increases, their SNR slightly decrease. This is
expected since they create some interference for each other. How-
ever, even when 20 sensors transmit simultaneously, their average
SNR is higher than 29 dB. Such results show that mmX enables
a robust mmWave network for multiple nodes, even when they
communicate simultaneously.
10 DISCUSSION
In this section, we compare mmX with existing wireless systems
such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and other mmWave platforms. Specifically,
we compare these systems in terms of cost, power consumption,
throughput, range, carrier frequency, and energy efficiency. Table 1
shows the results of this comparison.
Comparison with other mmWave platforms: Past mmWave
platforms such as MiRa and OpenMili cost a few thousand dollars
and consume a few tens of watts. On the other hand, mmX costs
only $110 and consumes 1.1 watt. However, past mmWave platforms
