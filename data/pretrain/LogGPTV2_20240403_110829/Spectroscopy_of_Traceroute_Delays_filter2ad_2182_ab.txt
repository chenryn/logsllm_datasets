these gigE interfaces have different ICMP generation rate for packet sizes under 1500
and over 1500 bytes.4
Each linear ﬁt has a slope and an intercept. The slope is in ns/bit (not µs/byte), to
match the gigE rate, 1 ns/bit. The intercept at 0 and the values of ax + b at three packet
sizes (x =40, 1500, and 9000 bytes) are the minimum delays including deserialization
(but not serialization)5 and ICMP generation.
The only router/probe type with ICMP generation rate equal to link rate is the Foundry
TimeExceeded at over 1500 bytes; others have smaller or larger slopes. Note that small
slopes a for packets under 1500 bytes can trick variable packet size (VPS) tools [7]
into capacity overestimation, whereas slower-than-link rates (higher values of a) can
result in underestimation. This situation is similar to the underestimation caused by
extra serialization delays at Layer 2 switches that are invisible to traceroute [29].
Delays through the Juniper router are special in several respects (Fig.3). The mini-
mum delay of the TimeExceeded packets grows stepwise by approximately 4.033 µs per
64-byte cell for sizes 64–320 bytes: d = 4.033(cid:4)x/64 + 31(cid:5)µs where (cid:4)x(cid:5) is the smallest
integer greater or equal to x. This formula is similar to that for ATM delays from [30],
although the ﬁxed cost (which for 64-byte packets is 128 µs, an equivalent of almost
40 KB at the OC-48 wire speed) is much higher than ATM’s encapsulation cost. This
4 We did not pinpoint a precise byte value for this boundary; it may be router-dependent. Also,
the Cisco OC48 interface produces slightly different linear ﬁts for packet size ≤ 1500 and >
1500, but since their relative difference is under 0.1%, we provide and discuss only the single
ﬁt of Cisco OC48 delays across the full range of packet sizes.
5 Recall that Dag cards timestamp at the beginning of a packet [20].

Fig. 3. (a) Minimum TimeExceeded delay from Juniper (left) with a staircase of 64-byte segments,
4 µs steps and an 8-µs jump at 320 bytes; (b) TimeExceeded delay from Juniper (right) showing
about 30 µs of extra delay for an interprobe gap (IPG) of 2 sec. Three bands of delays result from
the three ranges of interprobe gaps: light-colored band for IPG < 1ms, medium dark band for IPG
between 1ms and 1s, and dark band for IPG ≥ 1s
cell rate would result in an average bitrate of 7.877 ns/bit, or 127 Mbps. However, the
experimental curve jumps by an extra cell’s worth of delay right after 320, 3712 and
7104 bytes (which are separated by 3392 bytes, or 53 64-byte cells). As a consequence,
the slope in the linear programming-based lower bound is somewhat higher. That is, 54
cells worth of delay per 53 cells of size equals 8.026 ns/bit, but the LP estimate from
Table 2 is 8.091 ns/bit, which may imply a 0.8% error in 4.033 µs cell time. Fig.3a
shows a close-up for packets under 1600 bytes. The staircase of minimum delays starts
under the line y = 4.033x/64 + 32 (recall that (cid:4)x(cid:5) < x + 1) but crosses over the line
between 320 and 321 bytes. The 8-µs jump at 320 bytes and the accumulated discrep-
ancy with the straight line (12 µs over 9000 bytes interval) can potentially be measured
by traceroute-like tools, even though individual 4µs-steps may be hard to discern from
network noise.
The Juniper router also delayed widely spaced (interprobe gap of 2s) packets by
about 30 µs compared with closely spaced packets of the same size. This delay could be
due to route cache ﬂushing. The delay pattern in Fig.4 (bottom) which holds for 2400
(0.4%) probes rate-limited to 10 ms (packets 2–4 in some traceroutes) has a prominent
negative trend that could potentially be used for ﬁngerprinting.

Fig. 4. TimeExceeded message delay from Juniper OC48. Values over 10 ms (top) and 9–10
ms (bottom). Values between 9–10 ms reveal unusual size dependence of ICMP TimeExceeded
generation delay when ICMP is rate-limited to 100 packet per second (one packet in 10 ms)

Figs. 5 and 6 show the dependence of ICMP delays on packet size for the Cisco OC48
interface, separated into three sets by interprobe gap (time between traceroute packets):
under 1 ms, 1ms–1s, over 1 s. The actual distibution of the longer lulls clusters around 10
ms (kernel scheduling quantum) and 2 sec (traceroute timeout), both described in Sec.3
(Fig.2). Probes delayed by 10–20 ms span a wider range of ξ (reﬂected in the width of

reﬂects about 20 µs of extra delay (presumably route cache warm-up) beyond the lower bound of

However, unlike the Foundry data, the slope under 1500 bytes is positive, albeit smaller than the
slope over 1500 bytes. The position of the curve in the top panel reﬂects about 20 µs of extra delay
