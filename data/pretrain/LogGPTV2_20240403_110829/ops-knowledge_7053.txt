I understand that you are having trouble installing `easy_install` and `pip`, which in turn is preventing you from installing `pytmx`. Let's go through the steps to resolve this issue and make sure everything is set up correctly.

### Environment Details
- **Python Version**: 2.7.9
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 Professional
- **PY_HOME Variable**: `C:\Python27`
- **PATH Variable**: `%PY_HOME%;%PY_HOME%\Lib;%PY_HOME%\DLLs;%PY_HOME%\Lib\lib-tk;C:\Python27\scripts`

### Steps to Install `pip` and `pytmx`

1. **Verify Python Installation**:
   - Open Command Prompt (CMD) and type:
     ```sh
     python --version
     ```
   - Ensure it returns `Python 2.7.9`.

2. **Install `pip`**:
   - Download `get-pip.py` from the official site: 
     ```sh
     curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
     ```
   - Run the script to install `pip`:
     ```sh
     python get-pip.py
     ```

3. **Verify `pip` Installation**:
   - Type the following command to check if `pip` is installed:
     ```sh
     pip --version
     ```
   - It should return the version of `pip`.

4. **Install `pytmx`**:
   - Now, you can use `pip` to install `pytmx`:
     ```sh
     pip install pytmx
     ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Ensure `Scripts` Directory is in PATH**:
  - Double-check that `C:\Python27\Scripts` is included in your `PATH` environment variable.
  - You can verify this by typing:
    ```sh
    echo %PATH%
    ```
  - If it is not included, add it:
    ```sh
    setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python27\Scripts"
    ```

- **Run Commands from the Correct Directory**:
  - If you still encounter issues, try running the commands from the `C:\Python27\Scripts` directory:
    ```sh
    cd C:\Python27\Scripts
    pip install pytmx
    ```

### Summary

- Ensure Python and `pip` are correctly installed.
- Verify that the `Scripts` directory is in your `PATH`.
- Use `pip` to install `pytmx`.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to install `pytmx` without any issues. If you continue to experience problems, please provide the exact error messages, and I will help you further.
