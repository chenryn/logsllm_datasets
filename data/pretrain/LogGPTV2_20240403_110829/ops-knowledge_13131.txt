User: Briefly describe the concept and characteristics of RESTful API, and use examples to illustrate its basic principles and application methods
Assistant: RESTful API is a Web API based on HTTP protocol and conforming to REST principles. Its core idea is to expose resources in the form of URIs and operate on resources through different methods of the HTTP protocol. The characteristics of RESTful API include the following aspects: 1. Unique identification of resources: each resource has a unique URI. 2. Resource representation: The resource representation can be data in any format, such as JSON, XML, etc. 3. Operation methods: operate on resources through different methods of the HTTP protocol, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. A simple example is, suppose there is a website whose URI is https://example.com, and the website provides a resource named "user", then to get all user information, you can use the GET method to request https:// example.com/users is the URI; if you want to add a new user, you can use the POST method to submit the user information in JSON format to the https://example.com/users URI. The basic principle of RESTful API is to design API based on URI and HTTP method, provide resource representation, and operate resources through HTTP protocol. Its application methods include the following aspects: 1. URI design: URIs should be clear, use nouns rather than verbs, and follow naming conventions. 2. Use of HTTP method: Select the appropriate HTTP method according to the operation type, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. 3. Representation of resources: supports multiple formats of data representation, such as JSON, XML, etc. 4. Error handling mechanism: Provide reasonable error information and status codes, which are convenient for developers to process and debug. Through the RESTful API, application scenarios such as front-end and back-end separation, micro-service architecture, and data sharing can be realized to improve development efficiency and reduce system coupling.
