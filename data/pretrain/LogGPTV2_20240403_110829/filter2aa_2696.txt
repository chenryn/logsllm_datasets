Why Hack a Wind Farm?
• Wind energy
– Becoming the predominant source of renewable energy
– 4.7% of electricity generated in the United States in 2015
– Contribution expected to climb to 20% by 2030
• Increased reliance on wind energy draws attention to attackers
• Modern wind farms are operated by computers and networks
• What’s the worst that could happen?
– https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfzgIxMEo8g
– Mechanical failures can be influenced by targeting insecure control networks!
• But most importantly…

What is a Wind Farm?
• Power plant that converts wind into electricity
• Wind turbines
– Variable power source that generates energy from wind
• Substations
– Collects the energy produced by wind turbines and feeds it 
into the power grid
• IEC-61400-* specifications
– Defines design, operations and communications requirements

IEC-61400-25
• Defines uniform communications requirements for wind power 
plants
• Support for a handful of protocols 
– SOAP-based web services
– OPC XML-DA
– DNP3
– IEC 60870-5-104
– IEC 61850-8-1 MMS
14
What is OPC?
• First released in 1996 with the goal of abstracting PLC specific protocols 
into a standardized and generic interface
– (OPC) Object linking and embedding for Process Control
– Different variations have been developed over the years
• OPC UA, OPC XML, OPC XML-DA, etc...
• Used to exchange real-time data, monitoring of alarms/events, and… 
set/update control values 
• Client/server architecture
– Client = Issues the OPC read/write request message
– Server = Translates request into appropriate field bus command
15
OPC XML-DA Specification
• Uses SOAP messages to exchange data (HTTP, XML) 
• OPC XML-DA message services
– Status
– Read
– Write  
– Subscription
– Browse
– …
– Get Properties
16
Overview of Vulnerabilities
• Programmable automation controllers (PACs)
– Running legacy operating systems
– Everything running as root!
– Use of insecure remote management services
– Easy to guess or vendor default passwords
– No code signing!
• No authentication or encryption of control messages
• No network segmentation between wind turbines
• Extremely weak physical security
• Exactly what we would expect from an ICS  
• And now the fun begins… 
Vendor Implementation != Specification
• OPC XML-DA messages are sent in the clear by default!
• Technical specification assumes this…
• Sometimes people don’t follow instructions 
• OPC XML-DA spec. overly reliant on the vendor to tack on 
additional encryption to secure protocol (e.g., SSL/TLS)
• Fail…

OPC-XML-DA Specification –
“security”
19
OPC-XML-DA Specification –
“disable write”

Example OPC-XML-DA 
Read Request Items
• Wind speed
• Break status
• Rotor pitch angle
• Power production
• Rotor RPM
• Nacelle direction
• Ambient temperature inside nacelle
• Misc. temperatures
– Oil, rotor, generator
• Controller operating status
21
Example OPC-XML-DA 
Write Request Commands
• Specifics will vary from vendor to vendor
• Change maximum power generation output
• Wind turbine operating state
– On
– Off
– Idle
– Emergency shutdown (not graceful)
• A.K.A “Hard Stop”
• Induces excessive wear and tear on critical mechanical components!
22
Wind Farm Control Network Access Vectors
• Access can be achieved in a number of ways
– Physical access to remote turbines in the middle of a field
– Physical security mechanisms can be easily defeated with lock picks or bolt cutters
• Attach rogue device to ICS network switch inside the turbine
– Raspberry Pi with cellular or Wi-Fi module for remote out-of-band access
– Boom. You’re in!

Building Blocks for Wind Farm 
Security Assessment Tools
• Developed wind farm network security assessment tools
– Specifically, to attack IEC-61400-25 protocols and network services
• Command-and-control protocol reverse engineering
– Tcpdump/Wireshark – Static analysis 
– Scapy – Dynamic analysis
• Raspberry Pi 3 (Linux)
– Python 2.7
– Bash
– Scapy – for packet manipulation/fabrication
– Nmap – for identifying remote OPC servers (running inside of wind 
turbines)
– Iptables – for dropping/forwarding packets
• Wind* suite of tools
26
Windworm
• Targeting programmable automation controllers (PACs)
– Cross-compile malware for embedded platforms (e.g., Windows, 
Linux, RTOS)
• Leverage root user accounts with default/weak passwords
• Malware propagation technique
– Malware upload -> FTP
– Malware execution -> Telnet
• Modify critical wind turbine process control variables
– CANopen (object dictionary)
– Layout of a controller Object Dictionary is defined in the vendor 
Electronic Data Sheet (EDS)
– Manipulate power generation and motor variables/limits 
• Repeat… pwn wind farm
27
Windransom Scenario
• Goal: Paralyze wind farm operations
• Unless ransom is paid
– $$$BTC$$$
• How would this work??

What is the Potential Financial Impact
Due to Wind Farm Downtime?
• Lost revenue to the wind farm energy company?
– Assume 100% dependence on wind energy (no other renewable sources)
– Assume a 35% capacity factor (worst case)
• 250 MW × 365 days × 24 hours × 35% = 766.5 GWh = 766,500 MWh = 766,500,000 kWh
• Example of a ransomware infected wind farm
– 250 MW (max capacity)
– 167 x 1.5 MW wind turbines
– @ $0.12 cents/kWh
30
Downtime (hours)
Cumulative cost of wind farm downtime
1
~ $10,500 (35% capacity) - $30,000 (max capacity)
8
~ $84,000 - $240,000
24 (one day)
~ $252,000 - $720,000
48 (two days)
~ $504,000 - $1,440,000
72 (three days)
~ $756,000 - $2,160,000
168 (one week)
~ $1,764,000 - $5,040,000
336 (two weeks)
~ $3,528,000 - $10,080,000
672 (one month)
~ $7,056,000 - $20,160,000
2016 (three months)
~ $21,168,000 - $60,480,000
Wind Farm Malware Outbreak Recovery?
• How to recover from a large-scale attack?
– Different perspectives on this depending on who you are (e.g., operator and vendor)
– Reimage automation controllers (timely)? 
– Replace hardware (costly and timely)? 
• How do you know the infection has been fully remediated?
– How confident are you that it won’t reappear?
• In the mean time, the operator is losing out on the ability to 
produce electricity
– Which means they’re loosing $$$
31
Key Takeaways and Conclusions
• A call-to-arms for securing wind farm control networks!
• Wind farm control networks are extremely susceptible to 
attack
– This is just the tip of the iceberg
• Be proactive 
– Don’t wait on vendors to provide “security”
– Verify vendor claims on “security”
– Retrofit security as needed
• Wind turbine network segmentation
– Inline firewalls at each tower 
– Encrypted VPN tunnels for each tower
