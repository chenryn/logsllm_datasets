## Disclaimer
- All affected parties have been notified of the identified security issues.
- The presenter is not a power grid engineer.
- Do not attempt any of these actions without proper authorization.

## Why Hack a Wind Farm?
- **Wind Energy**: 
  - A growing source of renewable energy, contributing 4.7% of U.S. electricity in 2015, with an expected increase to 20% by 2030.
  - Increased reliance on wind energy makes it a target for potential attackers.
- **Modern Wind Farms**: Operated by computers and networks, making them vulnerable to cyber threats.
- **Potential Consequences**:
  - Mechanical failures can be induced by targeting insecure control networks.
  - Preventing attackers from turning peaceful systems into targets of ransomware or causing massive damage.

## What is a Wind Farm?
- **Power Plant**: Converts wind into electricity.
- **Components**:
  - **Wind Turbines**: Variable power sources that generate energy from wind.
  - **Substations**: Collect and distribute the energy produced by wind turbines to the power grid.
- **Specifications**: IEC-61400-* defines design, operations, and communications requirements.

## Red Teaming a Wind Farm
- **Red Teaming at Over 300 Feet**:
  - **Nacelle**
  - **Turbine**
  - **Communications Infrastructure**
- **Wind Farm Operations Control Network**:
  - **IEC-61400-25**: Defines uniform communication requirements, supporting protocols such as SOAP-based web services, OPC XML-DA, DNP3, IEC 60870-5-104, and IEC 61850-8-1 MMS.

## Understanding OPC
- **OPC (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control)**:
  - First released in 1996 to standardize PLC-specific protocols.
  - Variants include OPC UA, OPC XML, and OPC XML-DA.
  - Used for real-time data exchange, monitoring alarms/events, and setting/updating control values.
  - **Client/Server Architecture**:
    - **Client**: Issues OPC read/write request messages.
    - **Server**: Translates requests into appropriate field bus commands.

## OPC XML-DA Specification
- **Data Exchange**: Uses SOAP messages over HTTP and XML.
- **Message Services**:
  - Status
  - Read
  - Write
  - Subscription
  - Browse
  - Get Properties

## Overview of Vulnerabilities
- **Programmable Automation Controllers (PACs)**:
  - Running legacy operating systems.
  - Everything runs as root.
  - Insecure remote management services.
  - Easy-to-guess or default vendor passwords.
  - No code signing.
- **Control Messages**: No authentication or encryption.
- **Network Segmentation**: Lack of segmentation between wind turbines.
- **Physical Security**: Extremely weak.

## Vendor Implementation vs. Specification
- **OPC XML-DA Messages**: Sent in the clear by default.
- **Technical Specification**: Assumes additional encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) will be implemented by vendors.
- **Common Failures**: Vendors often do not follow these instructions, leading to insecure implementations.

## Example OPC-XML-DA Requests
- **Read Request Items**:
  - Wind speed
  - Break status
  - Rotor pitch angle
  - Power production
  - Rotor RPM
  - Nacelle direction
  - Ambient temperature inside nacelle
  - Miscellaneous temperatures (oil, rotor, generator)
  - Controller operating status
- **Write Request Commands**:
  - Change maximum power generation output.
  - Wind turbine operating state (On, Off, Idle, Emergency Shutdown).
  - Induces excessive wear and tear on critical mechanical components.

## Wind Farm Control Network Access Vectors
- **Physical Access**: Remote turbines in fields, often secured with easily defeated locks.
- **Rogue Device Attachment**: Attaching a Raspberry Pi with cellular or Wi-Fi modules to the ICS network switch inside the turbine.

## Security Assessment Tools
- **Developed Tools**:
  - Target IEC-61400-25 protocols and network services.
  - Use Tcpdump/Wireshark for static analysis and Scapy for dynamic analysis.
  - Raspberry Pi 3 with Python 2.7, Bash, Scapy, Nmap, and Iptables.
  - Wind* suite of tools.

## Malware Propagation
- **Targeting PACs**:
  - Cross-compile malware for embedded platforms (Windows, Linux, RTOS).
  - Leverage root user accounts with default/weak passwords.
  - Propagate via FTP and execute via Telnet.
  - Modify critical wind turbine process control variables using CANopen (object dictionary).

## Ransomware Scenario
- **Goal**: Paralyze wind farm operations until a ransom is paid.
- **Financial Impact**:
  - Lost revenue due to downtime.
  - Example: 250 MW wind farm with 167 x 1.5 MW turbines, generating $0.12 per kWh.
  - Downtime costs range from $10,500 for one hour to $60,480,000 for three months.

## Recovery from Malware Outbreak
- **Reimaging Automation Controllers**: Time-consuming.
- **Replacing Hardware**: Costly and time-consuming.
- **Confidence in Remediation**: Ensuring the infection is fully eradicated and will not reappear.
- **Financial Loss**: Operator loses the ability to produce electricity, resulting in significant financial losses.

## Key Takeaways and Conclusions
- **Call to Action**: Secure wind farm control networks.
- **Proactive Measures**:
  - Don't wait for vendors to provide security.
  - Verify vendor claims.
  - Retrofit security as needed.
  - Implement network segmentation with inline firewalls and encrypted VPN tunnels.
