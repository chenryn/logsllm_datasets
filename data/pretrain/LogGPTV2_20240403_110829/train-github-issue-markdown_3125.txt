### Apache Airflow version
Other Airflow 2 version (please specify below)
### What happened
AirFlow version 2.3.3.
When we use TaskFlow API for the DAG and have some task with
`trigger_rule="none_failed"` this task fails when its predecessor is skipped.
The error occurs during XCom read:
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/airflow/models/xcom_arg.py", line 152, in resolve
        raise AirflowException(
    airflow.exceptions.AirflowException: XComArg result from exec at skip_test with key="return_value" is not found!
### What you think should happen instead
It should execute its code with empty input. This behaviour existed in version
2.2.3. Also it's well aligned with behaviour of general tasks connected by
arrows: downstream task executes successfully with empty input.
### How to reproduce
  1. Create a DAG.
  2. Add `@task`-decorated task that raises `AirflowSkipException`
  3. Add another `@task`-decorated task that checks if its input is empty.
  4. Pass an output of the first task to the second task.
  5. Add DummyOperator task as a downstream of the first task. `trigger_rule="none_failed"`
  6. Execute a DAG.
  7. The second task fails.

        exec_res = exec()
        finish(exec_res)
        exec_res >> finish_2
        return 
    G_DUMMY = skip_test()
