federal agencies were included in the exercise to demonstrate the breadth of user familiarity on 
interoperability equipment across all levels of government. 
Recommendation:

The LA/LB UA is served by a number of radio systems operating in various public safety frequency bands.  Systems 
available include a countywide 800 megahertz system, an ultra high frequency (UHF) system operating in the public 
safety UHF and UHF-Television bands, a very high frequency (VHF) high-band system, and a VHF low-band system.    
The cities of Burbank, Culver City, and Glendale share a UHF, digital, Motorola SmartZone™ system, known as the 
Interagency Communications Interoperability System.  The City of Long Beach also operates shared VHF and UHF 
systems for various departments within the city, including the Police, Fire, Public Works, and Health and Human 
Services departments.  In addition to these shared systems, interoperability is available through the use of shared 
channels, radio caches, and gateways.  The fixed gateway is located and managed at the Sheriff’s Communications 
Center (SCC) in Los Angeles.  The CHP and the City of Long Beach have console patching capabilities.  Additionally, 
there are nine mobile gateways available in the area.  The LA Regional Tactical Communications System (LARTCS), 
located at and managed by the SCC, is the major fixed gateway serving the area.  LARTCS plans to design and procure 
an expanded multiband mutual aid communications system that provides coverage throughout Los Angeles County, 
including the surrounding national forests. 
The Regional Interoperability Steering Committee is planning the construction of a shared P25 UHF trunked radio 
system covering the UA.  The implementation of a shared UHF P25-compliant system would allow the use of multiple 
vendors.

The Interoperable Communications Project Group (ICPG) began meeting in 2003 and oversaw the Tactical 
Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) development.  As identified in the documentation, it does not 
appear that the group is formalized, and as noted by TICP peer reviewers, the UA should further “explain 
governing responsibilities and relation to the Urban Area Working Group (UAWG)” to clarify how the 
organizations work together.  The Oakland area has completed strategic planning efforts; however, a formal 
plan has not yet been adopted by the included agencies.  This strategy, as it gets adopted, can also support the 
prioritization of goals so that funding can be planned accordingly.   With most project funding supported 
through annual federal grants, long-term funding was indicated by the UA as a concern.  With respect to the 
federal grants, it does appear that the agencies give consideration to regional interoperable communications 
while procuring equipment.  Although the local leadership is strong (demonstrated by involvement from 
local mayors and other executives), there are regional leadership differences (across the multiple 
jurisdictions) that may slow progress toward interoperability across the UA as a whole. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Identify and document the roles, responsibilities, and relationships within the decision-making group 
(e.g., ICPG membership, relationship to UAWG) 
• 
Continue to develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed memoranda of understanding 
[MOU] with defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies to support partnerships 
on regional interoperability 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store 
them in an accessible format 
• 
Continue to establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant 
• 
Adopt and implement the regional strategic plan 
• 
Continue to align regional and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability 
needs are met 
• 
Continue to develop and implement a regional approach to budgeting and procuring regional 
communications interoperability assets 
• 
Continue to develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable 
funding that is consistent with the strategic plan 
• 
Encourage broader involvement by senior government leadership on interoperability funding and 
procurement plans 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
The Oakland TICP is based on existing policies and procedures.  Since these SOPs were already well 
established and used frequently, the public safety agencies in the UA were well positioned to adopt the TICP.

The UA has taken a number of steps to disseminate and train on the SOPs among the participating 
organizations.  According to the Exercise Evaluation Guide, despite a minor issue with naming conventions 
on shared channels, the UA was largely successful in the use of its documented procedures.  National 
Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) has been used throughout the UA 
for more than a year, with countywide training ongoing.  This is consistent with a state mandate for NIMS 
compliance.  The exercise evaluation indicated that “members of the Unified Command staff worked 
together very effectively.”  The Communications Unit Leader was likewise praised for decisions in allocating 
communications resources during the exercise. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider scheduling a regular review and update process of developed policies and procedures 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance 
Usage: Advanced Implementation 
The UA frequently uses its available means of interoperable communications (e.g., radio cache, gateways, 
shared channels, and shared systems).  Additionally, officials in the area report proficiency during real-world 
events (e.g., football games) where radio caches and gateways are used to provide communications to local, 
state, and federal agencies.  During the TICP validation exercise, the participants were able to establish 
interoperable communications despite some minimal technical difficulty (e.g., no roll call taken for gateways 
and shared systems). The exercise was noteworthy for its complexity and the test it provided among local, 
state, and federal agencies in the area. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and 
day-to-day activities

The City of Oakland has two ACU-1000 gateways, and the County of Alameda has four deployable Infinimux G4 
gateway devices.  Currently, interoperability is achieved by using the gateways, shared proprietary radio systems, and 
National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) channels for mutual aid.  The surrounding County of 
Alameda has a Motorola, 800 megahertz, trunked, communications system.  The adjacent County of Contra Costa and 
several other adjacent localities field conventional very high frequency and ultra high frequency communications 
systems. 
The UA is planning for a new communications system that will be a shared, Project 25 (P25) standard radio system and 
encompass the two-county area to create a regional communications system.  Regional agencies will become part of the 
shared P25 radio system and will be given subscriber units to use NPSPAC frequencies for mutual aid.  In addition, a 
networked gateway system will be installed to assure operable communications during the migration of the new P25 
system; allowing a gateway to outside agencies that are not P25 capable.

The Sacramento UA has two committees in place that coordinate interoperability issues; the Urban Area 
Security Initiative (UASI) communications group is focused on governance, and the Sacramento Regional 
Radio Communications System (SRRCS) committee is a technical group focused on the development and 
oversight of the area’s shared system.  SRRCS has been in place since 1992, and the group meets on a 
weekly basis.  Formalized contracts and memoranda of understanding (MOU) are in place for participating 
local agencies, as well as selected state and federal agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. 
Marshals Service, U.S. Coast Guard).  Although a strategic planning process is in place, it is not clear 
whether this long-standing process has developed a documented, formal, regional strategic plan.  This 
strategic planning process could provide a method to improve cooperation with California Highway Patrol 
(CHP), California Statewide Interoperability Executive Committee, and other public safety organizations.  
Local political leaders have provided policy and fiscal support, and funding is being provided based on 
regional needs through grants as well as user fees.       
Recommendations: 
• 
Encourage additional regional, state, and federal agency participation (e.g., CHP and California Division 
of Forestry) to participate in the decision-making group 
• 
Continue to formalize agreements (e.g., MOUs) with needed participants, including additional state and 
federal organizations   
• 
Continue to document and implement the regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the 
Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan [TICP]), with participant approval, adoption, and 
acceptance 
• 
Continue to align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability 
needs are met 
• 
Incorporate the regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan, and consider funding

The Sacramento UA has had formal, region wide SOPs through its SRRCS structure, which has been in place 
since 1996.  The TICP is based on these previously developed policies and has been distributed to all 
included agencies.  Additional steps, such as storing applicable SOPs with radio caches and gateways, would 
support the continued dissemination and implementation of these policies.  Sacramento officials indicated 
that there has been success in the regular use of these policies and procedures.  However, officials also

Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), and training was ongoing.  As noted in the 
After Action Report, while some gaps were identified in overall command and control (e.g., Incident 
Commander did not initially incorporate the fire command within the unified command structure and did not 
efficiently delegate responsibilities to appropriate responders), the certified Communications Unit Leader 
showed proficiency during the TICP validation exercise.

The Sacramento UA primarily uses its 800 megahertz (MHz) shared system, as well as monthly use of the 
Folsom gateway and periodic use of radio caches (primarily for planned events).  In the TICP validation 
exercise, the UA successfully used state mutual aid channels and tied these channels to the SRRCS shared 
system using a gateway device.  The Sacramento UA involved all first responders in the exercise and should 
build up this success by further incorporating state, federal, and support agencies in its TICP and future 
exercises.  The addition of these outside agencies would facilitate improved cooperation and ensure that 
implementing interoperability beyond the use of the SRRCS is regularly practiced.  The Sacramento UA 
seamlessly used its shared system, as recently demonstrated when public safety agencies responded to the 
wounding of an officer who was conducting a traffic stop operation in a remote area.     
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability 
resources to improve proficiency and familiarity of use 
• 
Broaden state and federal agency involvement in training and exercises to facilitate interagency 
cooperation 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

In 1995, the Sacramento UA implemented an 800 MHz trunked radio system to serve most of the local government and 
public safety jurisdictions.  This radio communications system is known as the SRRCS.  It consists of 2 Motorola 
SmartNet™ simulcast systems with a total of 49 frequency pairs.  There are six fixed sites throughout Sacramento 
County.  
The Sacramento UA is working toward upgrading this system to become fully compliant with Project 25 standards.  
Currently, however, the SRRCS is being upgraded to a Motorola SmartZone™ 4.1, funded by the  UASI grant program.

The San Diego Urban Area (UA) includes the City of San Diego and counties of San Diego and Imperial. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation  
The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) Peer Review stated that “[t]his was one of the most 
thorough, well planned TICPs reviewed and reflects an earnest effort by many of the people who have a 
vested interest and can be viewed as a model.”  The San Diego UA established strategic communications 
interoperability planning as a priority over a decade ago.  This long-term success and collaboration in the UA 
points to significant support from executive leadership in the UA.  While the TICP seems well-established, 
organizing all agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding [MOU]) in an accessible format would support 
continued coordination among participating agencies.  The established partnership between San Diego law 
enforcement and the Department of Justice (DoJ) Integrated Wireless Network (IWN) is commendable, and 
should be considered a best practice.  The San Diego UA should continue to reach out to organizations (e.g., 
utilities) not specifically involved in the decision-making group.  The San Diego UA has budget plans for 
system upgrades, as well as operations and maintenance, but it is unclear how many years out funding is 
allocated. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Recommend working toward the establishment of a regional MOU for interoperability (if a regional 
MOU is not already in place), and reference all applicable agreements in the TICP and store them in an 
accessible format 
• 
Continue to identify long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) communications interoperability funding sources 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation  
San Diego officials indicated that 90 percent of the TICP was based on previous policies, and these SOPs are 
well documented in their TICP.  Exercise evaluators observed responder operation of communications 
systems, which demonstrated the effective use of policies, practices, and procedures.  Evaluators also noted 
that these SOPs “within the San Diego UA are effective in providing for tactical interoperable 
communications among local responders” during real-world incidents.  Additional steps, such as 
disseminating, formalizing, and training on these tactical policies, would support the widespread and 
consistent use of the SOPs .  The National Incident Management System (NIMS)/ Incident Command 
System (ICS) has been implemented for more than 1 year, and the certified Communications Unit Leader 
showed proficiency during the TICP validation exercise.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to conduct training so that SOPs remain entrenched in operations 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The San Diego UA uses its shared system on a daily basis for multi-agency, multidiscipline responses.  Use 
of this shared system provides a means of interoperability to most users in the UA.  Repeated 
multijurisdictional responses to wild land fires have led to ongoing improvements in the usage of 
interoperable communications equipment.  The UA showed proficiency in the use of radio caches and the 
shared system to provide seamless communications during the TICP validation exercise.  In addition, 
exercise participants were able to demonstrate familiarity and effective use of gateways and shared channels. 
The San Diego UA has established a partnership with the University of California, San Diego to prototype a 
regionwide, public safety wireless data network - High Performance Wireless Research and Education, 
which is commendable and should be considered a best practice.

Technology Overview    
The San Diego UA’s Regional Communications System is a large 800 megahertz (MHz), trunked system that spans two 
counties.  It supports the majority of the area’s users.  The City of San Diego also operates an 800 MHz, trunked 
system.  Both of these systems support shared talk groups for mutual aid with large contingents of federal users 
operating in the very high frequency band.  There are also mobile gateways and console patches available for 
interoperability among federal and local first responders. 
Both the city and county of San Diego are upgrading their respective proprietary, trunked systems to the same version 
for improved interoperability.  Both jurisdictions are interested in future migration to the Project 25 standard, but the 
costs to do so have been prohibitive thus far.  The area is also working toward installing a wide-area digital, microwave 
backbone to provide a dedicated, high-speed link for data sharing and collaboration.  Public safety administrators, 
elected officials, and the San Diego Association of Governments, in collaboration with San Diego State University, 
have been actively working to develop a regional technology framework.  The expected governance agreement will 
effectively establish a Regional Authority whose goals will include developing long-term priorities for the funding of 
technology projects and a “Clearinghouse” process for the review of technology grant requests to ensure that the 
requests are in the best long-term interests of regional public safety and that they are coordinated to avoid duplicate 
grant requests.
