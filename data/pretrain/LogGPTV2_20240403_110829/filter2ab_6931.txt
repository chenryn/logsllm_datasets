**Title: Black Hat USA 2018: Over-the-Air Exploitation of Tesla Gateway, BCM, and Autopilot ECUs**

**Abstract:**

Keen Security Lab of Tencent has successfully executed two remote attacks on the Tesla Model S and X in 2016 and 2017. Last year, at Black Hat USA, we presented the technical details of our first attack chain. During that presentation, we also showcased a demonstration video of our second attack, but without delving into the technical specifics. This year, we are excited to share the comprehensive, in-depth details of our 2017 research.

In this presentation, we will explain the inner workings of the technology and demonstrate the new capabilities developed during our 2017 hacking of Tesla vehicles. The new attack chain includes multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in various in-vehicle components. 

We will provide an in-depth analysis of the critical components within Tesla cars, including the Gateway, Body Control Module (BCM), and the Autopilot Electronic Control Units (ECUs). For example, we exploited a code-signing bypass vulnerability to compromise the Gateway ECU. We also reverse-engineered and customized the BCM to activate the Model X "Holiday Show" Easter Egg, demonstrating the potential for both malicious and entertaining use cases.

Finally, we will discuss a remote attack that allowed us to gain unauthorized access to the Autopilot ECU on a Tesla vehicle by exploiting a particularly interesting vulnerability. To our knowledge, this presentation will be the first to demonstrate a successful hack of an Autopilot module.

**Key Points:**
1. **Overview of Previous Attacks (2016 and 2017)**
2. **Detailed Explanation of the 2017 Attack Chain**
3. **Analysis of Critical Components:**
   - **Gateway ECU:** Exploiting a code-signing bypass vulnerability.
   - **Body Control Module (BCM):** Reverse-engineering and customization.
   - **Autopilot ECU:** Gaining unauthorized access through a novel vulnerability.
4. **Demonstration of New Capabilities and Potential Impacts**

This presentation aims to provide a thorough understanding of the vulnerabilities and the methods used to exploit them, offering valuable insights for both security researchers and automotive manufacturers.
