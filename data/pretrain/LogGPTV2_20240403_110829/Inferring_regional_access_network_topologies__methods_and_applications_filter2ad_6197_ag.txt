We denoted each unique combination as a region. To obtain a comprehensive list of LSPGWs (Lightspeed Gateways), we utilized Rapid7’s rDNS dataset [53], which periodically resolves the rDNS names for the entire IPv4 address space. This allowed us to identify hostnames and corresponding IPs that matched our regex criteria. In September 2020, we identified 95,821 IPs across 37 regions.

### Geolocation Anomalies
If a geolocation hint is outdated, anomalies in the traceroute often reveal this. For example, if a traceroute includes backbone IP addresses between nodes with the same geolocation hint, it likely indicates a stale geolocation hint.

### Traceroute Analysis
To uncover network paths within MPLS tunnels, we applied the Direct Path Revelation (DPR) technique [73]. We conducted inter- and intra-region traceroute measurements to all addresses in the EdgeCO router prefixes, which correspond to the egress interfaces of the tunnels. This process revealed hidden links in the regional network. Table 5 illustrates a sample traceroute within the San Diego region, showing an additional link (hops 4 and 5) that was previously hidden. Table 6 lists all the IP prefixes for routers discovered in AT&T’s San Diego region.

### Mobile Mapping Details
For target selection, we used the AS relationship dataset [11] to identify neighboring ASes for each mobile ISP. We found 266, 406, and 213 neighboring ASes for AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, respectively. We then conducted a pilot test to compile lists of target IPs for each ISP, ensuring at least one responsive IPv4 and IPv6 destination per neighboring AS.

The ShipTraceroute results showed that network paths to all targets shared the same paths within the mobile network until exiting the PGWs. Tables 7 and 8 show the number of PGWs inferred using region bits in AT&T and Verizon IPv6 addresses, respectively.

### Traceroute Examples
Figures 20a and 20b illustrate traceroute examples for regional probing of AT&T. Figure 20a shows an intra-region traceroute from a VP in San Diego, CA, to a lightspeed gateway (lspgw) in the same city. The third hop is the IP of an EdgeCO router. Figure 20b shows an inter-region traceroute from a VP in Santa Cruz, CA, to the same lspgw in San Diego, CA. The path traverses COs in the Santa Cruz region (hops 3-5), AT&T’s backbone network (hops 6-7), and finally the San Diego region (hops 8-9).

AT&T blocked traceroute measurements toward most LSPGWs from the public Internet but allowed traceroutes from within and nearby regions. We used four CAIDA Ark VPs in and near San Diego to conduct ICMP paris-traceroutes to LSPGW IPs, partially revealing the topology connecting EdgeCOs and AggCOs in the region. To observe the rest of the topology, we needed to expose MPLS tunnels between the BackboneCO and LSPGWs, which hide AggCOs and many EdgeCOs. We used both intra- and inter-region traceroutes to LSPGWs to discover these prefixes.
