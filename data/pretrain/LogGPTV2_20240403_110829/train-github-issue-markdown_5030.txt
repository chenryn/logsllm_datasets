Hello,

## Expected Behavior
When using a `TextField` with types such as `datetime-local`, `time`, `date`, etc., the label should not overlap with the pre-populated content of the underlying input tag. I expect the pre-populated content to be hidden when the `TextField` does not have focus, and to appear only when it has focus. Additionally, the label's position should change to accommodate the pre-populated content.

## Current Behavior
Currently, the label overlaps with the pre-populated content in the `TextField`. The label only stops overlapping once the field is completed.

### Example
