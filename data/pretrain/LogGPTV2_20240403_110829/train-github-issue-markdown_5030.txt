Hello,
## Expected behaviour
The TextField's label clashes with the underlying tag's pre-populated content
when using type=[datetime-local|time|date|etc]. I would expect the pre-
populated content to be hidden when the TextField does not have focus and
appear only when it does have focus and the label's position is changed.
## Current behaviour
Code:
Example:

The label stops classing when the field is completed.
