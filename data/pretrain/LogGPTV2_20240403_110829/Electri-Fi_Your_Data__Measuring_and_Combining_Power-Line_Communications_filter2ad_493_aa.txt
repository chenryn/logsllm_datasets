ABSTRACT
Power-line communication (PLC) is widely used as it oﬀers
high data-rates and forms a network over electrical wiring,
an existing and ubiquitous infrastructure. PLC is increas-
ingly being deployed in hybrid networks that combine mul-
tiple technologies, the most popular among which is WiFi.
However, so far, it is not clear to which extent PLC can
boost network performance or how hybrid implementations
can exploit to the fullest this technology. We compare the
spatial and temporal variations of WiFi and PLC.
Despite the potential of PLC and its vast deployment in
commercial products, little is known about its performance.
To route or load balance traﬃc in hybrid networks, a solid
understanding of PLC and its link metrics is required. We
conduct experiments in a testbed of more than 140 links.
We introduce link metrics that are crucial for studying PLC
and that are required for quality-aware algorithms by recent
standardizations of hybrid networks. We explore the spatial
and temporal variation of PLC channels, showing that they
are highly asymmetric and that link quality and link-metric
temporal variability are strongly correlated. Based on our
variation study, we propose and validate a capacity estima-
tion technique via a metric that only uses the frame header.
We also focus on retransmissions due to channel errors or to
contention, a metric related to delay, and examine the sen-
sitivity of metrics to background traﬃc. Our performance
evaluation provides insight into the implementation of hy-
brid networks; we ease the intricacies of understanding the
performance characteristics of the PHY and MAC layers.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless technology is dominant in local networks; it oﬀers
mobility and attractive data-rates. Nevertheless, it often
leaves “blind spots” in coverage, and the network becomes
saturated because of the increasing demand for higher rates
and of the explosion of network applications. Today’s net-
works call for additional, simple technologies that can boost
network performance, extend coverage, and improve quality
of service. Several candidates, among which power-line and
coaxial communications, are on the market. As the demand
for combining diverse technologies increases, new speciﬁca-
tions for hybrid networks are developed, such as the IEEE
1905 standard [2] which speciﬁes abstraction layers for topol-
ogy, link metrics, and forwarding rules.
Due to the growing demand of reliability in home net-
works, wireless and power-line communications (PLC) are
combined by several vendors to deliver high rates and broad
coverage without blind spots. PLC is at the forefront of
home networking, as it provides easy and high data-rate con-
nectivity. Its main advantage is coverage wider than WiFi
and data-rates up to 1Gbps without requiring the wiring of
a new network. It is obvious that PLC can be a lucrative
backbone for WiFi. However, in the quest to provide reli-
able performance, some questions arise: Where and when
does PLC perform better than WiFi? How fast does PLC
channel quality change? What are the diﬀerences between
the two technologies and which medium(s) should an appli-
cation use? Such questions remain unanswered as of today
and a goal of this work is to address them.
Despite its wide adoption, PLC has received far too lit-
tle attention from the research community. Moreover, IEEE
1905 is technology agnostic and it does not provide any for-
warding nor metric-estimation methods. To fully exploit the
potential of each medium, hybrid networks require routing
and load-balancing algorithms.
In turn, these algorithms
require accurate capacity estimation methods, and a solid
understanding of the underlying layers of each network tech-
nology. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been
any study on PLC; so far a very large body of work has only
introduced theoretical channel models. In this work, we in-
vestigate PLC from an end-user perspective, and we explore
link metrics and their variations with respect to space, time,
and background traﬃc; this is our main contribution. We
focus on two metrics required by IEEE 1905 [2]: the PHY
rate (capacity) and the packet errors (loss rate).
325The most popular speciﬁcation for high data-rate PLC,
employed by 95% of PLC devices [1], is HomePlug AV1. This
speciﬁcation was adopted by the IEEE 1901 standard [6]. In
this work, we dig deeply into the 1901 performance and pro-
vide link-quality estimation techniques. We ﬁrst present the
key elements of the PHY and MAC layers in Section 2, and
we detail on our measurement methodology for PLC in Sec-
tion 3. In Section 4, we explore experimentally the gains of
incorporating PLC in a WiFi network and explain why tem-
poral variation studies are crucial for a reliable performance.
We focus on WiFi blind spots and bad links and discuss how
PLC can mitigate high-traﬃc scenarios.
We delve into both the PHY and MAC layers of PLC via
a testbed of more than 140 links. In Section 5, we investi-
gate the spatial variation of PLC and ﬁnd that PLC links
are highly asymmetric. This has two consequences: (i) Link
metrics should be carefully estimated in both directions; (ii)
Predicting which PLC links will be good is challenging. We
study the temporal variation of the PLC channel in Sec-
tion 6, and distinguish three diﬀerent timescales for the link
quality. Exploring temporal variation is important for ex-
ploiting to its fullest extent each medium and for eﬃciently
updating link metrics (e.g., high-frequency probing yields
accurate estimations but high overhead). In Section 7, we
explore the accuracy of a capacity-estimation technique by
designing a load-balancing algorithm and by employing our
temporal-variation study. To explore the 1905 metric related
to packet losses, we examine the retransmission procedure
and how link metrics are aﬀected by contention in Section 8.
By employing our temporal variation study and our two link
metrics, PLC performance can be fully characterized and
simulated, thus reducing the overhead complexity of the ex-
act representation of the channel model and the PHY layer
mechanisms. We summarize our guidelines for link-metrics
estimation in Section 9. We verify our ﬁndings by using
devices from two vendors and HomePlug technologies. Our
key ﬁndings and contributions are outlined in Table 1.
2. BACKGROUND ON PLC
We now recall the main features of the PHY and MAC lay-
ers for the most popular PLC speciﬁcation, which is Home-
Plug AV (HPAV) equivalently, IEEE 1901 [6].
2.1 PHY Layer
The physical layer of HPAV is based on an OFDM scheme
with 917 carriers in the 1.8-30 MHz frequency band. Each
OFDM carrier can employ a diﬀerent modulation scheme
among BPSK, QPSK, 8/16/64/256/1024-QAM. In contrast,
in WiFi technologies, such as 802.11n, all carriers employ the
same scheme and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS)
index is used for decoding the frame [3]. Because each car-
rier employs diﬀerent modulation schemes, PLC stations ex-
change messages with the modulation per carrier, the for-
ward error correction code (FEC) rate, and other PHY layer
parameters [6]. The entity that deﬁnes these PHY options
is called the tone map, and it is estimated during the chan-
nel estimation process. To do so, the source initially sends
sound frames to the destination by using a default, robust
modulation scheme that employs QPSK for all carriers. This
1HomePlug alliance is the leader in PLC standardization [1].
In addition to high data-rate PLC, there are low-rate speciﬁ-
cations for home automation, such as HomePlug GreenPhy.
WiFi vs PLC
Section
In short distances, WiFi yields higher throughput, but
with much higher variability, compared to PLC.
PLC usually oﬀers high gains in quality of service en-
hancements, coverage extension and link aggregation.
Capacity estimation methods and temporal variation
studies are needed to fully exploit the mediums.

Channel Quality and Variation
Section
PLC links can exhibit severe asymmetry and spatial
variation is diﬃcult to predict.
Temporal variation of the PLC channel occurs over
three diﬀerent time-scales.
Variation on the short-term depends on the noise pro-
duced by electrical appliances.
Variation on the long-term depends on the appliances
and their power consumption.
Link quality and link metric variation are strongly cor-
related and good links can be probed much less often
than bad ones.

pacity estimation, which is required by IEEE 1905 [2].

scheme is used for the initial channel estimation and com-
munication between two stations, but also for broadcast and
multicast transmissions. The destination estimates the chan-
nel quality using the sound frames, then it determines and
sends the tone map with a unique identiﬁcation – which is
analogous to MCS for 802.11n – back to the source. The
destination can choose up to 7 tone maps: 6 tone maps for
diﬀerent sub-intervals of the AC line cycle called slots, and
one default tone map. PLC uses multiple tone maps for the
diﬀerent sub-intervals of the AC line cycle, because the noise
and impulse response of the channel are varying along the
AC line cycle. Tone maps are updated dynamically, either
when they expire (after 30 s) or when the error rate exceeds
a threshold [6].
2.2 MAC Layer
We now review the MAC layer and describe its most im-
portant sub-functions.
Physical Blocks (PB): The MAC layer employs two-
level frame aggregation. First, the data are organized in
physical blocks (PB) of 512 bytes, then the PBs are merged
into PLC frames. A selective acknowledgment (SACK) of
the PLC frame acknowledges each PB, so that only the cor-
rupted PBs are retransmitted.
Access Methods: The MAC layer of IEEE 1901 includes
both TDMA and CSMA/CA protocols [6]. However, to the
best of our knowledge, all current commercial devices imple-
ment only CSMA/CA. The CSMA/CA protocol is similar
to 802.11 for wireless communications, but with important
diﬀerences that are summarized in [19]. The main diﬀer-
ence is that, contrary to WiFi, PLC stations increase their
contention windows (CW) not only after a collision, but also
after sensing the medium busy. This is regulated by an addi-
tional counter, called the deferral counter. One of the main
consequences is short-term unfairness that might yield high
jitter [19], [21].

Management Messages (MMs): Management mes-
sages are a key feature of PLC. They are used for network
management, tone-map establishment and updating. Sta-
tions must exchange MMs each time the tone map is up-
dated, because the source has to be notiﬁed for the modula-
tion scheme of each carrier.
Vendor-Speciﬁc Mechanisms: IEEE 1901 leaves the
implementation of some mechanisms, such as the channel
estimation procedure described in Section 2.1, unspeciﬁed.
Therefore, they are vendor-speciﬁc and so far, vendors have
not released any detailed speciﬁcation for their devices.
In addition to MMs speciﬁed by the standard [6], there are
vendor-speciﬁc MMs. Vendor-speciﬁc MMs are employed
to conﬁgure the devices, modify the ﬁrmware, or measure
statistics. We use vendor-speciﬁc MMs to measure statistics
or conﬁgure the devices, as described in the next section.
Start-of-Frame Delimiter (SoF): The frame control,
or the start-of-frame (SoF) delimiter, of PLC contains in-
formation for both PHY and MAC layers. The bit loading
estimate (BLE) is retrieved from the SoF delimiter and is
an estimation for the capacity, as we observe in Section 7.
The BLE is an estimation of the number of bits that can be
carried on the channel per µs.
Definition 1. [6] Let Tsym be the OFDM symbol length
in µs (including the guard interval), R be the FEC code rate,
and P Berr be the PB error rate (chosen based on the expected
PB error rate on the link when a new tone map is generated.
It remains ﬁxed until the tone map becomes invalidated by a
newer tone map). Let also B represent the sum of number
of bits per symbol over all carriers. Then, BLE is given by
BLE =
B × R × (1 − P Berr)
Tsym

We now describe the MAC layer processes that aggregate
the Ethernet packets into PLC frames. Figure 1 sketches the
IEEE 1901 MAC layer. The Ethernet packets are organized
in PBs. Then, the PBs are forwarded to a queue, and based
on the BLE of the current tone-map slot s BLEs, they are
aggregated into a PLC frame. The frame duration is de-
termined by BLEs, the maximum frame duration (speciﬁed
by [6]), and an aggregation timer that ﬁres every few hun-
dreds of ms after the arrival of the ﬁrst PB, as concluded
from our measurements2. The PLC frame is transmitted
by a CSMA/CA protocol explained in [19]. The receiver
decodes the frame and transmits a SACK that informs the

transmitter of which PBs were received with errors. We ob-
serve that the full retransmission and aggregation process,
and, as a result, the MAC and PHY layers, can be modeled
using only two metrics: P Berr and BLEs.
Today’s home networks, running 802.11n and/or 1901,
contain ﬁelds in the frame header that help the receiver de-
code the frame and that accurately estimate capacity. We
successfully employ these ﬁelds to aggregate bandwidth be-
tween the two mediums in Section 7. In the following, our
PLC link metrics will be BLE and P Berr.
3. EXPERIMENTAL FRAMEWORK
We describe the experimental settings used to produce the
measurements of this work. We provide guidelines for con-
ﬁguring and for obtaining various metrics from PLC devices.
3.1 Testbed and Setup
Our main testbed consists of 19 Alix 2D2 boards run-
ning the Openwrt Linux distribution [4]. The boards are
equipped with a HomePlug AV miniPCI card (Intellon INT6300
chip), which interacts with the kernel through a Realtek Eth-
ernet driver and with an Atheros AR9220 wireless interface.
All our stations are placed on the same ﬂoor of a univer-
sity building with oﬃces. Figure 2 represents a map of the
testbed along with the electrical map of the ﬂoor.
We next explain the PLC network structure. PLC uses
a centralized authority called the central coordinator (CCo)
to manage the network. To operate, each station must join
a network with a CCo. Usually, the CCo is the ﬁrst station
plugged and it can change dynamically if another station
has better channel capabilities than it does. Our ﬂoor has
two distribution boards that are connected with each other
at the basement of the building. This means that the cable
distance between the two boards (more than 200m) makes
the PLC communication between two stations at diﬀerent
boards challenging. Due to the two distribution boards,
none of the stations can communicate with all stations and
be the CCo. Hence, we create two diﬀerent networks, shown
with diﬀerent colors in Figure 2. To avoid modiﬁcations
in the network structure, we set the CCo statically in our
testbed using [5], a tool described in the next subsection.
These networks have diﬀerent encryption keys (there is en-
cryption on the MAC layer) and thus, only stations belong-
ing to the same network can communicate with each other.
In total, 144 links are formed.
In addition to using our main testbed, we experiment and
validate our ﬁndings with HPAV500 devices, the Netgear
XAVB5101 (Atheros QCA7400 chip)3. Due to space con-
straints, results are presented for our main testbed, unless
otherwise stated.
3.2 Measurement and Trafﬁc Tools
To retrieve the metrics for the PHY and MAC perfor-
mance evaluation, we use a tool that interacts with the
HomePlug AV chips, i.e., the Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit [5]4.
The tool uses vendor-speciﬁc management messages (MMs),
as described in Section 2.2, to interact with, and to conﬁgure
the devices. It also enables a sniﬀer mode with which we can
3Note that, compared to HPAV described in Section 2.1,
HPAV500 extends the bandwidth to 1.8-68 MHz.
4We have been equipped with devices from 6 vendors and
have been able to retrieve statistics from all devices using [5].

generate traﬃc, we use iperf. For all the experiments, links
are saturated with UDP traﬃc (unless otherwise stated), i.e.,
stations transmit at maximum available rates, so that we
can measure metrics such as capacity. All the experiments
of this work have been repeated multiple times over a period
of one year to make sure that similar results are reproduced.

well as the methods used to measure them.

We ﬁrst study the spatiotemporal variation of WiFi vs
PLC in order to explore the possibilities of combining the
two mediums towards quality of service improvement, cover-
age extension and bandwidth aggregation. We then discuss
the challenges of hybrid implementations.

in our testbed, with WiFi and PLC interfaces having simi-
lar nominal capacities5. This study quantiﬁes the gains that
