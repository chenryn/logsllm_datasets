**Abstract:**
This experience report details the design and implementation of safety-critical software and hardware for respiratory-gated radiation therapy using a medical linear accelerator. Respiratory gating is a radiotherapy technique used to treat cancer in the lung, liver, and abdomen, where tumors move with the patient's breathing. The system uses x-ray fluoroscopy to track tumor positions and triggers the linear accelerator when the tumor is in the correct position. This paper focuses on the comprehensive safety strategy, particularly the online monitoring techniques for ensuring the proper operation of the fluoroscopic imaging panels and the pattern recognition algorithms for tumor identification.

**1. Introduction**
Radiation therapy is a crucial component in the management and treatment of cancer, aiming to deliver a lethal dose of radiation to tumor cells while minimizing exposure to healthy tissues. Modern radiation therapy equipment can deliver radiation with high precision, but the quality of treatment is compromised for tumors in the lungs and abdomen due to their movement during respiration. Tumor motion, which can be up to 3-4 cm, can lead to underdosing the tumor or overdosing surrounding healthy organs.

Respiratory-gated radiation therapy is a promising method to address this issue by synchronizing radiation delivery with the breathing cycle. X-ray imaging and real-time tracking of fiducial markers are used to determine the tumor's position and control the radiation beam. This experience report describes the development of a dependable system architecture for respiratory-gated radiation therapy, part of the Integrated Radiotherapy Imaging System (IRIS) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The project aims to develop a real-time imaging and therapy system for precise tumor localization and radiation-beam delivery. Key safety features include watchdog processes and timers, and online monitors for continuous error detection and feedback to the operator.

**2. Overview of the IRIS System**
This section outlines the physical architecture of the IRIS system, including the tumor imaging and tracking software, and the high-level safety requirements driving the design decisions.

**2.1 System Model**
Figure 1 illustrates the IRIS system, an integrated radiotherapy and imaging system deployed at MGH since 2004. It consists of a medical linear accelerator and two diagnostic x-ray imaging systems mounted on a gantry. The x-ray systems include two x-ray tubes and two flat-panel area detectors, allowing for various image-guided treatment modalities such as patient setup, cone-beam CT, and real-time tumor tracking. The x-ray imaging panels send 14-bit grayscale images to the control computer at data rates up to 45 MB/second per imager. High-resolution mode provides images of 2048 x 1536 pixels with a pixel size of 0.2 mm and an imaging frequency of up to 7.5 frames per second. Low-resolution mode offers 1024 x 768 pixels, a pixel size of 0.4 mm, and an imaging frequency of up to 30 frames per second.

**2.2 Tracking Application**
The IRIS tracking software is a multi-threaded custom application running on Windows 2000. Real-time operating systems were not used due to the lack of support for necessary hardware drivers. The software continuously detects the position of a radio-opaque marker implanted near the tumor. Algorithm 1 describes the main loop, which acquires images, finds markers, triangulates their 3D position, monitors tracking quality, and controls the treatment beam. The imaging and detection loop requires approximately 50 ms for high-resolution images, with a steady-state processor load of about 40 percent. The remaining processing power is used for real-time display and logging.

**2.3 IRIS Safety Requirements**
The IRIS system uses commercially available medical devices, each designed to meet specific safety and reliability standards. The linear accelerator and x-ray generators have built-in safety features to limit radiation exposure in case of faults. However, additional safety risks arise from the use of IRIS as a gating system. These include the risk of delivering radiation to the wrong location and the potential for excessive fluoroscopic imaging. To mitigate these risks, there are tolerances on the accuracy and reliability of tumor localization, and limits on the delay for image acquisition and treatment delivery.

**3. Fault Monitoring and Recovery**
This section discusses online monitoring techniques for detecting hardware and software failures within the IRIS application, ensuring high fault coverage, and possible operator-initiated recovery actions.

**3.1 Control-Flow Failures**
Control-flow failures in the IRIS software are detected using watchdog timers and processes. If a failure is suspected, the hardware relays controlling the radiation beam are deactivated. Watchdog timers monitor the program execution, and if the timer expires, it indicates a failure, leading to the deactivation of the radiation beam.

**Conclusion**
This report has outlined the architecture and safety features of the IRIS system for respiratory-gated radiation therapy. Future work will focus on further developing the user interface, conducting formal system testing, and designing structured clinical procedures to bring the system into use for patient care.
