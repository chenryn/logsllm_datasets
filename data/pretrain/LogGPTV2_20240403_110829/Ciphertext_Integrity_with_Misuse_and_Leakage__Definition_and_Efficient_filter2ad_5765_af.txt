### Message

This approach prevents the adversary from performing a matching attack on the first block of the hash function implementation alone. The first block will already have an unknown input, which in turn makes the inputs of all subsequent blocks unknown.

### Observations and Definitions

These observations lead to the following definition:

**Definition 7.4.** A hash function \( H : \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \) with leakage function \( L \) is \((q, t, \epsilon)\)-leakage-resilient if, for every \((q, t)\)-bounded adversary \(\mathcal{A}_L\), the advantage
\[ \left| \text{Hash}_0^{\mathcal{A}_L, H} - \text{Hash}_1^{\mathcal{A}_L, H} \right| \]
is bounded by \(\epsilon\). Here, \(\text{Hash}_b^{\mathcal{A}_L, H}\) is defined as the probability that \(\mathcal{A}_L\) outputs 1 when, after a query \((m_0, m_1) \in \mathcal{M}^2\), it is returned the pair \((H(r \| m_b), L(r \| m_b))\) with \(r \xleftarrow{\$} \mathcal{R}\).

### Leakage-Resilient PRF and Hash Function

Based on these definitions of leakage-resilient PRFs and hash functions, the next section demonstrates the LMCPA (Leakage-Resilient Chosen Plaintext Attack) security of DCE (Differential Cryptanalysis Encryption) and DTE (Differential Timing Encryption). These results should be understood similarly to those in [37], where it was argued that semantic security with negligible advantage is impossible to achieve even if the leakage of an encryption would be as low as a single message bit (in contrast, leaking a bit of the secret key may not be an issue).

Informally, what we show next is that the execution of our leakage-resilient authentication scheme for many messages does not significantly degrade the security compared to the situation with a single message. Additionally, the security degradation resulting from the encryption of a long multi-block message is not significantly worse than if this message had been encrypted block by block with fresh independent keys for each block.

However, it remains true that manipulating the message leaks some information that can be exploited via Simple Power Analysis (SPA), due to the initial hashing steps shown in Figures 2 and 5 and the stream encryption depicted in Figure 3.

### LMCPA Security of DCE and DTE Schemes

#### LMCPA Security of DCE

We start by focusing on the LMCPA security of the DCE scheme. The leakage function \( L(k, r, m) \) for DCE is defined by the pair \((L_H(r, m), L_{PSV}(k_0, r \| m))\), where \( k_0 \) is defined as \( F_k(H(r \| m)) \). The \( L_H \) component of this leakage contains the leakage occurring during the evaluation of the hash function in DCE encryption, and the \( L_{PSV} \) component contains the leakage of the encryption part of the DCE, as depicted in Figure 3, which we refer to as the "PSV-encryption component" of DCE. The \( L_{PSV} \) function itself returns leakages that are made up of individual leakages by each PRF and XOR operation, as defined in [37], but this is irrelevant for our analysis.

**Theorem 7.5.** Let \( H : \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \) be a \((0, t, \epsilon_{cr})\)-collision resistant and \((q, t, \epsilon_{LH})\)-leakage-resilient hash function. Let \( F \) be a \((q, t, \epsilon_F)\)-pseudorandom function. Let DCE be implemented with a PSV-encryption component that is \((q, t, \epsilon_{\text{leav}}^{PSV-\text{ENC}})\)-secure. Then, the DCE scheme with the leakage function \( L \) described above is \((q', t', \epsilon_{\text{lmcpa}})\)-secure. Here: \( q' \leq q - q_e - 1 \) where \( q_e \) is the number of encryption queries made by the \((q', t')\)-bounded LMCPA adversary; \( t' \leq t_1 - t_c - t_{sc} \), where \( t_c \) is the running time needed to run the LMCPA challenger in front of a \((q, t')\)-bounded adversary, \( t_{sc} \) is the time needed to determine whether a list of \( q_e \) hash values contains a collision; and \( \epsilon_{\text{lmcpa}} \leq 2 \frac{q_e^2}{|\mathcal{R}|} + 2\epsilon_{cr} + 4\epsilon_F + \epsilon_{LH} + \epsilon_{\text{leav}}^{PSV-\text{ENC}} \).

The proof of Theorem 7.5 is given in Appendix C.

#### LMCPA Security of DTE

The leakage-resilient CPA security of the DTE scheme can be shown in an almost identical way.

**Theorem 7.6.** Let \( H : \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \) be a \((0, t, \epsilon_{cr})\)-collision resistant and \((q, t, \epsilon_{LH})\)-leakage-resilient hash function. Let \( F \) be a \((2q, t, \epsilon_F)\)-pseudorandom function. Let DTE be implemented with a PSV-encryption component that is \((q, t, \epsilon_{\text{leav}}^{PSV-\text{ENC}})\)-secure. Then, the DTE scheme with the leakage function \( L \) described above is \((q', t', \epsilon_{\text{lmcpa}})\)-secure. Here: \( q' \leq q - q_e - 1 \) where \( q_e \) is the number of encryption queries made by the \((q', t')\)-bounded LMCPA adversary; \( t' \leq t_1 - t_c - t_{sc} \), where \( t_c \) is the running time needed to run the LMCPA challenger in front of a \((q', t')\)-bounded adversary, \( t_{sc} \) is the time needed to determine whether a list of \( q_e \) hash values contains a collision; and \( \epsilon_{\text{lmcpa}} \leq 2 \frac{q_e^2}{|\mathcal{R}|} + 4 \frac{(q_e + 1)^2}{|\mathcal{B}|} + 2\epsilon_{cr} + 4\epsilon_F + \epsilon_{LH} + \epsilon_{\text{leav}}^{PSV-\text{ENC}} \).

The proof shares almost all features of the one for the DCE scheme, and the handling of adversarial queries is the same. The double use of \( F_k \) just loosens the bounds of Theorem 7.5 by constant factors, by increasing the probability of collisions and doubling the number of queries that are needed when replacing the evaluation of \( F \) with the selection of random values (which is included in the \( t_c \) bound on the challenger running time). It is given in Appendix D.

### Conclusions

To conclude, our analyses focus on the leakages occurring during authenticated encryption (AE), so far excluding the possibility of targeting a decryption device. Interestingly, this limitation is very strong in the LR MAC and encryption schemes of [37] because random IVs are strictly needed for LR security, and a decryption oracle allows the adversary to control the IV. As discussed in Section 4, contradicting this requirement directly enables devastating forgery attacks based on standard Differential Power Analysis (DPA). By contrast, our notion of CIML (Ciphertext Integrity with Misuse and Leakage) aims at mitigating the impact of IV control. So, it is natural to investigate whether it formally rules out any attack against the decryption oracle.

Unfortunately, despite CIML security indeed ruling out many realistic attacks against a decryption device, our schemes remain susceptible to strong attacks when the decryption leaks. Taking the case of DTE, we can, for example, show that it is possible to forge valid ciphertexts thanks to decryption leakages as follows:
1. Pick a random \( r \) and message \( m \) and compute \( h = H(r \| m) \).
2. Ask for the decryption of ciphertext \( C_i = (\tau, c_i) \) with \( \tau = h \) and a random \( c_i \), and recover \( k_0 \) thanks to leakage.
3. Ask for the decryption of ciphertext \( C_j = (\tau', c_j) \) with \( \tau' = k_0 \) and a random \( c_j \), and recover \( k'_0 \).
4. Compute the ciphertext \( c \) produced using the encryption part of DTE from the ephemeral key \( k'_0 \), the random \( r \), and the message \( m \), so that \( C = (k_0, c) \) is valid (and has decryption \( m \)).

A similar attack can be performed against DCE. Note that this attack (which essentially exploits SPA to recover ephemeral keys) is admittedly more challenging than the standard DPAs in Section 4. Yet, it is also impossible to argue why such attacks should not be covered by our threat model. A formal treatment of CIML extended with decryption leakages has been recently proposed in [11].

Finally, our work is focused on CIML, which is an integrity notion primarily intended for authentication (or the authentication part of an AE scheme). By contrast, our treatment of LR CPA security so far excludes randomness misuse. The main reason for this separate treatment is that CIML can be achieved in a very liberal (mostly unbounded) leakage model. We leave the extension of these definitions towards a complete definition of LR MR AE as an interesting scope for further research.
