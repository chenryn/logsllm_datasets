message. This again prevents the adversary from performing
a matching attack on the first block of the hash function
implementation only, because that first block will already
have an unknown input, and will in turn make unknown the
inputs of all further blocks.
These observations lead us to the following definition.
Definition 7.4. A hash function H : ℛ × ℳ → ℬ with
leakage function L is (𝑞, 𝑡, 𝜖)-leakage-resilient if, for every (𝑞, 𝑡)-
bounded adversary 𝒜L, the advantage
is bounded by 𝜖, where Hash𝑏𝒜L,H is defined as the probability
⃒⃒⃒Hash0𝒜L,H − Hash1𝒜L,H
⃒⃒⃒
Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA
that 𝒜L outputs 1 when, after a query (𝑚0, 𝑚1) ∈ ℳ2, he is
returned with the pair (H(𝑟‖𝑚𝑏), L(𝑟‖𝑚𝑏)) with 𝑟 $← ℛ.
Based on these definitions of leakage resilient PRF and
hash function, the following section shows the LMCPA secu-
rity of DCE and DTE. Admittedly, these results should be
understood similarly to the ones in [37], where it was argued
that semantic security with negligible advantage is impossible
to achieve even if the leakage of an encryption would be
as low as a single message bit (in contrast, leaking a bit of
the secret key may not be an issue). So informally, what
we show next is that the execution of our leakage-resilient
authentication scheme for many messages does not signifi-
cantly degrade the security compared to the situation with a
single message, and that the security degradation resulting
from the encryption of a long multi-block message is not
significantly worse than if this message had been encrypted
block by block, with fresh independent keys for each block.
Concretely though, it always remains that manipulating the
message leaks some information that can be exploited via
SPA (as just explained), because of the initial hashing of
Figures 2 and 5 and the stream encryption of Figure 3.
7.3 LMCPA Security of the DCE and DTE
schemes
We start by focusing on the LMCPA security of the DCE
scheme. The leakage function L(𝑘, 𝑟, 𝑚) for DCE is defined
by the pair (LH(𝑟, 𝑚), LPSV(𝑘0, 𝑟‖𝑚)), where 𝑘0 is defined as
F𝑘(H(𝑟‖𝑚)). The LH component of this leakage contains the
leakage occurring during the evaluation of the hash function in
DCE encryption, and the LPSV component contains the leakage
of the encryption part of the DCE as depicted in Figure 3,
which we refer to as the “PSV-encryption component” of
DCE. The LPSV function itself returns leakages that are made
of individual leakages by each PRF and XOR operation, as
defined in [37], but this is irrelevant for our analysis.
PSV−ENC)-leav secure.
Theorem 7.5. Let H : ℛ × ℳ → ℬ be a (0, 𝑡, 𝜖𝑐𝑟)-
collision resistant and (𝑞, 𝑡, 𝜖LH )-leakage-resilient hash func-
tion. Let F be a (𝑞, 𝑡, 𝜖F)-pseudorandom function. Let DCE
be implemented with a PSV-encryption component that is
(𝑞, 𝑡, 𝜖leav
Then, the DCE scheme with the leakage function L de-
scribed above is (𝑞′, 𝑡′, 𝜖lmcpa)-secure. Here: 𝑞′ ≤ 𝑞 − 𝑞𝑒 − 1
where 𝑞𝑒 is the number of encryption queries made by the
(𝑞′, 𝑡′)-bounded LMCPA adversary; 𝑡′ ≤ 𝑡1 − 𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑠𝑐, where 𝑡𝑐
is the running time needed to run the LMCPA challenger in
front of a (𝑞, 𝑡′)-bounded adversary, 𝑡𝑠𝑐 is the time needed to
determine whether a list of 𝑞𝑒 hash values contains a collision;
and 𝜖lmcpa ≤ 2 𝑞2

The proof of Theorem 7.5 is given in Appendix C.
The leakage-resilient CPA security of the DTE scheme can
be shown in an almost identical way.
Theorem 7.6. Let H : ℛ × ℳ → ℬ be a (0, 𝑡, 𝜖𝑐𝑟)-

be implemented with a PSV-encryption component that is
(𝑞, 𝑡, 𝜖leav
Then, the DTE scheme with the leakage function L de-
scribed above is (𝑞′, 𝑡′, 𝜖lmcpa)-secure. Here: 𝑞′ ≤ 𝑞 − 𝑞𝑒 − 1
where 𝑞𝑒 is the number of encryption queries made by the
(𝑞′, 𝑡′)-bounded LMCPA adversary; 𝑡′ ≤ 𝑡1 − 𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑠𝑐, where 𝑡𝑐
is the running time needed to run the LMCPA challenger in
front of a (𝑞′, 𝑡′)-bounded adversary, 𝑡𝑠𝑐 is the time needed to

and 𝜖lmcpa ≤ 2 𝑞2

PSV−ENC.
The proof shares almost all features of the one for the DCE
scheme, and the handling of adversarial queries is the same.
The double use of F𝑘 just loosens the bounds of Thm. 7.5 by
constant factors, by increasing the probability of collisions
and doubling the number of queries that are needed when
replacing the evaluation of F with the selection of random
values (which is included in the 𝑡𝑐 bound on the challenger
running time). It is given in Appendix D.
8 CONCLUSIONS
To conclude this paper, we first observe that our analyzes
focus on the leakages occurring during AE, so far excluding
the possibility to target a decryption device. Interestingly,
this limitation is very strong in the LR MAC and encryption
schemes of [37] because random IVs are strictly needed for
LR security, and a decryption oracle allows the adversary
to control the IV. As discussed in Section 4, contradicting
this requirement directly enables devastating forgery attacks
based on a standard DPA. By contrast, our notion of CIML
aims at mitigating the impact of IV control. So it is natu-
ral to investigate whether it formally rules out any attack
against the decryption oracle. Unfortunately, and despite
CIML security indeed rules out many realistic attacks against
a decryption device, our schemes remain susceptible to strong
attacks when the decryption leaks. Taking the case of DTE,
we can for example show that it is possible to forge valid
ciphertexts thanks to decryption leakages as follows: (1) Pick
a random 𝑟 and message 𝑚 and compute ℎ = H(𝑟‖𝑚). (2)
Ask decryption of ciphertext 𝐶 𝑖 = (𝜏, 𝑐𝑖) with 𝜏 = ℎ and a
random 𝑐𝑖 and recover 𝑘0 thanks to leakage. (3) Ask decryp-
tion of ciphertext 𝐶 𝑗 = (𝜏′, 𝑐𝑗) with 𝜏′ = 𝑘0 and a random
𝑐𝑗 and recover 𝑘′
0, compute
the ciphertext 𝑐 produced using the encryption part of DTE
from the ephemeral key 𝑘′
0, the random 𝑟 and the message
𝑚, so that 𝐶 = (𝑘0, 𝑐) is valid (and has decryption 𝑚). A
similar attack can be performed against DCE. Note that this
attack (which essentially exploits SPA to recover ephemeral
keys) is admittedly more challenging than the standard DPAs
in Section 4. Yet, it is also impossible to argue why such
attacks should not be covered by our threat model. A formal
treatment of CIML extended with decryption leakages has
been recently proposed in [11].

We finally mention that our work is focused on CIML which
is an integrity notion primarily intended for authentication
(or the authentication part of an AE scheme). By contrast,

our treatment of LR CPA security so far excludes randomness
misuse. The main reason for this separate treatment is that
CIML can be achieved in a very liberal (mostly unbounded)
leakage model. We leave the extension of these definitions
towards a complete definition of LR MR AE as an interesting
scope for further research.
