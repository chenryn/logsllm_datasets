Fifth International Workshop on
Trustworthy Embedded Devices
(TrustED 2015)

ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoTS) is expected to seamlessly con-
nect everything and everyone and bring about the promise of
smart environments, industry 4.0, intelligent infrastructure
management, environmental monitoring and disaster recov-
ery, etc. The explosion in the number of interconnected
devices makes it a challenge to guarantee their security, the
security of their networks and the privacy of the data col-
lected by them. The Workshop on Trustworthy Embedded
Devices (TrustED) focuses on all aspects of security and pri-
vacy related to embedded systems and the IoTS. TrustED
2015 continues a successful series of workshops, which were
held in conjunction with ESORICS 2011, IEEE Security &
Privacy 2012, ACM CCS 2013 and ACM CCS 2014 (see
http://www.trusted-workshop.de for details). The goal of
this workshop is to bring together experts from academia
and research institutes, industry, and government in the ﬁeld
of security and privacy in cyber physical systems.

1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
The paradigm of ubiquitous computing and permanent,
mobile connectivity has already become reality through mod-
ern technologies that allow electronic systems to be em-
bedded practically everywhere, most prominently with the
smart phone. Examples of such ubiquitous inter-connected

systems include sensor nodes, smart meters, femtocells, au-
tomotive platforms, home gateways, smart homes, and IPTV
boxes, to name a few. Unfortunately, the new opportuni-
ties created by smart environments and infrastructures also
come with new security and privacy risks. This is particu-
larly true when embedded systems are involved, with which
we are expected to closely and, sometimes unknowingly, in-
teract in our daily lives. Embedded devices diﬀer signiﬁ-
cantly from “classical” systems, such as desktop PCs in sev-
eral aspects:
• Constrained resources: they have limited power,
memory and computation capabilities, and therefore
standard security solutions have to be re-designed.
• Ease of accessibility: malicious parties can access
them, replace them or physically tamper with them.
• Connectivity: we expect most (future) embedded
devices to be network enabled and often connected
to more powerful devices or gateways. This network
topology and the previous two characteristics makes
them perfect targets for network attacks.
Thus, the challenge is to develop security solutions that
guarantee trust, security, and privacy while meeting the con-
straints of embedded systems. Furthermore, guaranteeing
security across diﬀerent layers of the the embedded system
(hardware, OS, and application) while at the same time min-
imizing overhead is both a challenge and a requirement to
enable successful system deployment.
2. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
TrustED considers selected security and privacy aspects
of cyber physical systems and their environments, which in-
ﬂuence trust and trust establishment in such environments.
A major theme of TrustED 2015 was the security and pri-
vacy aspects of the Internet of Things Paradigm. The IoTs
promises to make reality Mark Weisser’s vision of ubiqui-
tous computation set out in his 1991 inﬂuential paper. Yet
to make such vision successful, it is widely acknowledged
that security of super large distributed systems has to be
guaranteed and the privacy of the collected data protected.
Submissions exploring new paradigms to assure security and
privacy in the IoTs are thus strongly encouraged.
The workshop topics include (but are not limited to) the
following:
• Embedded system security
• Hardware entangled cryptography
1715• New Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) construc-
tions and novel applications
• Remote attestation and integrity veriﬁcation
• Secure execution environments (e.g., TrustZone, TPMs)
on mobile devices
• Privacy aspects of embedded systems (e.g., medical
devices, electronic IDs)
• Physical and logical convergence (e.g., secure and privacy-
preserving facility management)
• New protection paradigms for trustworthy embedded
systems
• Novel paradigms to established trust in large distributed
environments
• Novel security architectures for the IoTs

and embedded system security. Previously, he was with
Philips Research in The Netherlands where he performed
fundamental work in the development of secure key stor-
age and anti-counterfeiting solutions based on SRAM Phys-
ical Unclonable Functions, which lead to the creation of the
company Intrinsic-ID. Jorge regularly publishes and serves
on conference program committees in the ﬁelds of embed-
ded security and hardware and applied cryptography. Jorge
