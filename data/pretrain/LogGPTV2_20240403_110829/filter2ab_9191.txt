titleblackhat:eu-22 The Hacker's Guide to Policyland
At the end of 2021, the UK Government launched a new National Cyber Strategy which outlined the UK's approach to being a responsible cyber power, setting a new standard internationally. The broad strategy set out an agenda to build both the UK cyber economy and improve cyber resilience of the UK as a whole, as well as to lead internationally in creating a more safe and secure digital ecosystem. We have seen this commitment reflected in numerous public policy consultations, various bills moving through the legislative process, and the UK Government's participation in international cyber diplomacy initiatives. There has been a huge amount of activity and it's hard to keep up, but it's critical for security professionals to do so as they will likely be highly impacted by new policy, and are also those best informed to create positive security outcomes, or avoid unintended harms. In this talk, Irfan Hemani of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and cybersecurity adviser, Jen Ellis, will provide a comprehensive view of the government's policy priorities and focus areas for cybersecurity. We will discuss the status of various initiatives and how they relate to international policy efforts. We will also provide a primer on how policy development works in the UK and how attendees can get involved to influence the outcomes.
