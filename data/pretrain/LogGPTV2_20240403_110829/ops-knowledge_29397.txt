User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What does it mean for an address to be invalid in context (error code OS 10049)? I'm trying to start an instance of Apache 2.2 server with a fairly-close-to-standard configuration file. I made one small change because I want Apache to serve a single XML file separately from everything else it does, purely for testing on my local machine. The change is that I inserted this into httpd.conf:

# Based on http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html

Listen 10.11.12.13:85

NameVirtualHost 10.11.12.13:85

&lt;VirtualHost 10.11.12.13:85&gt;
DocumentRoot "C:\foo\bar"
ServerName www.MyCompanyMyProjectFooBarTestURL.com
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


Attempting to start Apache resulted in this:


  (OS 10049)The requested address is not valid in its context.  : make_sock: could not bind to address 10.11.12.13:85
  no listening sockets available, shutting down
  Unable to open logs


No instances of Apache are running. Nothing is using port 85 (or 80 or 8080). There's nothing special about 10.11.12.13:85; I just figured that was an IP that wouldn't interfere with anything.

What does this error mean, and how can I resolve it?

Assistant: There could be reason the IP address you are pointing is generic one.
For example:-10.1.1.233:443
And you get error >>> (OS 10049)The requested address is not valid in its context.  : make_sock: could not bind to address 10.1.1.233:443

comment the line in httpd-ssl.conf
and start the Apache
