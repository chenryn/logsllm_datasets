User: is there a way to create a standalone .exe from a python script.
Executables generated with py2exe can run only with pythonXX.dll.
I'd like to obtain a fully standalone .exe which does not require to install the python runtime library.
It looks like a linking problem but using static library instead the dynamic one and it would be also useful to apply a strip in order to remove the unused symbols.
Any idea ?
Thanks.
Alessandro
Assistant: Due to how Windows' dynamic linker works you cannot use the static library if you use .pyd or .dll Python modules; DLLs loaded in Windows do not automatically share their symbol space with the executable and so require a separate DLL containing the Python symbols.
