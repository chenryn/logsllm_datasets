choose all the keywords as the keyword universe corresponding to
the known documents. The documents known to the attacker are
chosen uniformly from the document universe (i.e., 30,109 emails in
the Enron email dataset), and the percentage of leaked documents
varies from 100% to 0.1%.
5.2 Keyword Recovery
In our experiments for keyword recovery, we compare with the
PW-U attack, the PW-P attack, the CGPR attack and the attack in
[2] (BKM). The PW-U attack and the PW-P attack target EDESE
schemes and are based on L2 leakage. These are the most relevant
attacks to LEAP. As noted in [39], the PW-U attack and the PW-P
attack can also work without the prior knowledge of the dataset
3. However, they need an extra dataset as the training set. In or-
der to make the attacks effective, the extra dataset needs to share
similar property as the target dataset. The CGPR attack is another
attack that recovers query token with partial known document
set. In contrast, it mainly utilizes L1 leakage, rather than L2 leak-
age. The BKM attack is the state-of-the-art in keyword recovery
3Indeed, the attacks can tolerate imperfect auxiliary information.
