### Issue with CocoaPods and Flutter Plugins

**Problem Description:**
There is a known issue (CocoaPods/CocoaPods#7463) where using `:path` with a symlink in a Podfile causes `spec.public_header_files` to not work as expected. This issue prevents Swift projects from registering plugins correctly. I encountered this problem with the `mogol/flutter_secure_storage#3` plugin, and it also affects the Firebase Storage plugin.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a new Flutter project with Swift support in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Add the package `firebase_database: 0.3.6` to your `pubspec.yaml`.
3. Run the project on an iOS Simulator.

**Error Output:**

```
