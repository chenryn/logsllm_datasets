User: How to expand the capacity of a website with a large number of visits?
Assistant: To expand the capacity of a website with a large number of visits, the following measures can be taken: 1. Increase the number of servers and hardware devices: increase the number of servers and improve the performance of hardware devices to better respond to user requests and improve the speed and stability of website access. 2. Use load balancing technology: User requests can be distributed to different servers to achieve load balancing and avoid website downtime caused by overloading of a single server. 3. Use content distribution network (CDN): CDN can distribute website content to a series of servers, improve access speed and caching effect, and allow users to obtain website content faster. 4. Database optimization: Optimizing the database can reduce the load on the database and improve the response speed of the website. You can use caching, indexing, sub-table and other technologies to optimize the database. 5. Front-end optimization: Reasonable use of front-end optimization methods such as browser caching, image compression, and HTTP request reduction can reduce the burden on the server and improve website performance. 6. Introduce cloud computing technology: By migrating the website to the cloud computing platform, elastic expansion can be better realized, and server resources can be automatically adjusted as the number of users increases to improve website stability.
