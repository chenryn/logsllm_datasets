another vehicle without any observable signs. The identiﬁers
of the vehicles are shown partially-masked below (none is a
customer of an AutoCharge system):
Figure 10: Tree diagram indicating the potential data avail-
able under a range of communication scenarios.
9.1 Unencrypted Communications
Where our testing campaign captured the initialisation of a
charging session, we were able to examine the NMK ex-
change to form a network. In line with the ISO 15118 stan-
dard, every SLAC interaction we observed operated in inse-
cure form. As such, the NMK was delivered in plaintext and
the only barrier to acquiring it was receiving the message
intact. We were able to intercept the CM SLAC MATCH.CNF
message in 31 cases and acquire the NMK. Testing two ve-
hicles side-by-side, in 4 sessions the attacker was able to
extract an NMK value for one vehicle, meanwhile in one
session both NMK values were extracted.
In 9 cases, the
subsequent CM GET KEY.CNF message was also recovered to
obtain the ephemeral NEK and permit passive decryption of
physical-layer trafﬁc.
Examining compromised sessions, we saw the expected
behaviour as the vehicle and charger established a network,
the vehicle undertook the discovery protocol to ﬁnd a charge
controller and the two established a TCP connection. No TLS
tunnel was established in any charging session we observed,
leaving the high-level protocols exposed. Where external au-
thorisation is employed, as it was in our testing, the use of
TLS is optional under ISO 15118. Yet its complete absence
from any vehicle or charger came as a surprise, especially
given the charging locations were all public.
As a result we conﬁrm that a passive attacker can wire-
lessly monitor all trafﬁc at the PHY layer and that this ability
results from standards-compliant behaviour, suggesting it is
persistent. Likewise, the option to forego TLS means charg-
ing data is also left in the clear. We discuss this situation and
its implications in Section 10.
9.2 Private Data
Figure 10 provides a breakdown of potential data available
when eavesdropping, under various charging conditions or
in the presence of different services. The PHY-layer trafﬁc is
always available and permits access to any higher-level com-
munication, such as charging or internet access, that does
not take additional steps to secure itself. Two unique iden-

We were able to obtain the identiﬁers in 41 cases (76%)8
from a variety of locations including the two-car arrange-
ment shown in Figure 8. Here the identiﬁers for both vehi-
cles were acquired from the same antenna position, suggest-
ing that an attacker could simply park next to a charging sta-
tion and collect identiﬁers as other users arrive subsequently
providing them9 in order to obtain free charging on another
user’s account. As the charging spots are operated by a sin-
gle provider, the attacker can be conﬁdent of targeting valid
customers.
User Tracking
In the simplest attack, charging sessions
are linked by monitoring a number of busy public chargers
for the appearance of vehicle identiﬁers. From time-of-day,
charge duration and location information, behavioural pro-
ﬁles can be inferred. The invasiveness of the attack increases
where the attacker is able to match a vehicle identity to other
data. Popular charger-sharing schemes [60] allow anyone to
register their home or business charger as a public site; any
user booking to charge can then be associated with their vehi-
cle identiﬁer and tracked at any monitored station. Monitor-
ing a charger near a sensitive event such as a union meeting,
protest gathering or compromising night-spot would reveal
more personal information about an individual’s habits.
With a wireless attack, a wardriving approach also al-
lows an attacker to associate a vehicle with a street address.
This could easily be conducted by a delivery driver or postal
worker as they visit properties regularly. Known MAC allo-
cations to manufacturers provide a coarse-grained indication
of the vehicle as well, such as identifying expensive vehicles
and then determining when they have been left in a public
car park, or indeed when their owner is out of the house.
10 Lessons Learnt
The reﬁnement of EV charging systems is still ongoing. In
light of our observations, we have distilled a set of security
lessons that can improve existing and future designs.
10.1 Wireless Threats
The most notable ﬁnding here is that the design of CCS com-
munication allows a wireless attacker to observe it at a dis-
831 cases from SLAC initialisation messages and 10 more from network
management messages
9Typically updating the MAC setting using open-plc-utils [45] and
a serial debug port over UART or SPI [21]
tance without prior interaction or tampering. In this case the
attack was entirely passive, but has similar implications for
the potential of active attacks that would currently be far
more invasive. As in-vehicle wireless systems have been
plagued by attacks in recent years, our results indicate that
a testing model which considers emissions security as well
as unwanted interference is crucial in future development.
10.2 Reliance on a Non-Existent PKI
The ISO 15118 security model, and thus that of CCS, re-
lies on the existence of a complex PKI, to underpin TLS at
the Transport Layer and XML Security for external message
values at the Application Layer. The merits of that infras-
tructure are an ongoing topic of academic study [8, 72, 52],
but its complexity also presents a more practical problem.
At the time of writing, no widespread ISO 15118 PKI is de-
ployed. While small-scale pilots have been attempted, there
is still open debate about provision of the infrastructure and
the authors are aware of public proposals from three differ-
ent commercial entities to provide transaction brokerage and
act as the Root Certiﬁcation Authority [27]. There is even
disagreement about the model the PKI will take; whether
it will derive from a single root of trust, a consortium of
trusted entities or some more open model [50]. Meanwhile
the competing pressures to provide new functionality remain,
spurring alternative solutions such as AutoCharge and en-
couraging service development without underlying security
provision.
Even once a PKI is operating for public chargers in large
charging networks, it remains unclear to what extent private
units in individual homes or ofﬁces will beneﬁt. A capac-
ity for self-signed contract certiﬁcates to be manually in-
stalled into vehicles by users does exist, but unless contract-
based billing is used ISO 15118 exempts charging installa-
tions from any security requirements; instead relying on the
physical security of the location and cabling — which we
have demonstrated to be insufﬁcient. Manufacturer choices
(and indeed user willingness) will determine whether private
chargers can enjoy these security beneﬁts.
It is important therefore to provide at least some security
implementation that is decoupled from the need for access to
a PKI. We discuss such an approach in Section 11.
10.3 Available PHY Security Disabled
The HomePlug GreenPHY (HPGP) PLC technology sup-
ports a Secure SLAC mode that protects the pairing and NMK
distribution process, but this is disabled by speciﬁcation in
the ISO 15118 standard, relying instead on TLS for all secu-
rity properties. While this can meet the charging use cases
outlined in that standard, it leaves an opportunity for a per-
vasive security baseline completely ignored, despite propos-
ing the communication channel for general use. All too of-
418    28th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
ten history has shown that leaving security to individual de-
velopers atop insecure platforms produces widespread secu-
rity problems, even more so when the channel is considered
physically private.
11 Countermeasures
To mitigate the unintended wireless channel, familiar emis-
sions security mechanisms such as chokes or shielding can
be applied to reduce leakage [7], although hardware modiﬁ-
cations for existing systems are costly and time-consuming.
Some proposals for future, high-power chargers include
liquid-cooled charging cables and we would expect this to
attenuate the signals if the cooling jacket wraps the commu-
nication lines as well as the power-delivery ones. This would
not eliminate emissions from the vehicle or charger circuitry
however, nor is it likely to exist in smaller, private chargers.
At a network level, we have argued for the use of the avail-
able HPGP security mechanisms above, but note that in their
present form they are still reliant on a PKI to function. In ad-
dition the HPGP key distribution behaviour itself introduces
an unnecessary risk of interception. Whether the SLAC pro-
tocol operates in its secure mode or not, it is still unilateral:
the charger generates a network key and then provides it to
the vehicle. However, the SLAC process is typically imple-
mented in software by the same devices that undertake the
higher-level ISO 15118 communication, including possible
TLS sessions, and as such require the capabilities for an El-
liptic Curve Difﬁe-Hellman key derivation for AES128 [48].
We propose additional steps in the SLAC initialisation, as
a fallback to provide conﬁdentiality from the MAC-layer up-
wards in the event that PKI access is unavailable. Figure
11 shows the modiﬁed protocol. Upon receiving a network
match request, the charger generates an Elliptic-Curve key-
pair (dC, QC) and instructs the vehicle to commence a key ex-
change, along with QC. If the vehicle also supports the pro-
tocol then it generates (dV , QV ) and responds with QV . The
derived key becomes the new NMK and the charger blanks
the NMK ﬁeld in the subsequent CM SLAC MATCH.CNF mes-
sage. If the vehicle does not support the protocol then the
unrecognised message will be dropped. The charger main-
tains a timeout counter after step 6.1 and, upon expiry, falls
back to the existing protocol’s step 7.
While it cannot provide authentication and therefore can-
not mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks, the threat of passive
eavesdropping is eliminated using this approach. By build-
ing only on existing functionality, the protocol is deployable
in existing vehicles as well as new ones.

quality, unintentional wireless channel. We have evaluated
the susceptibility of real-world chargers and found a reliable
channel in every case. Although conditions vary substan-
tially between sites, for eavesdropping we achieved a peak
successful recovery rate of 100% in one case and could in-
tercept trafﬁc several metres from the target, in a different
parking bay, with a rate of 91.8%. We showed how a se-
ries of further design choices allow recovery of network keys
and passive monitoring of all trafﬁc in plaintext. We pre-
sented lessons learnt and potential improvements to mitigate
the problems so that they do not hinder the secure adoption
of global EV charging infrastructure by the growing number
of EV owners worldwide.
