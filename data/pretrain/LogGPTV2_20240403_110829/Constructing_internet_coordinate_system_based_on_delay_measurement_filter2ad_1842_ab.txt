distance vector to the Cartesian coordinate.
Our proposed approach, ICS, shares the similarity with
GNP in that it also represents locations of hosts in the
Cartesian coordinate system instead of a distance data space,
and consequently, can extract topological information from
measured network distances. ICS, however, provides a unique
mapping from the distance data space to the Cartesian co-
ordinate system (and thus yields a more accurate represen-
tation). In addition, it has the following advantages:
• With the use of principal component analysis (PCA),
a host can calculate its coordinates by means of basic
linear algebra such as the singular value decomposi-
tion and matrix multiplication. The computational
overhead is reduced.
We analyze the distance matrix D in Eq. (2) to extract
topological information in a coordinate system. In the previ-
ous example of four hosts, the dimension of the distance ma-
trix D is four. As hosts in the same AS are very close to each
other, the distance can be represented in a two-dimensional
space by projecting their coordinates into two-dimensional
space. The dimensionality depends not on the dimension m
of the distance matrix D but on the network topology, and
can be much smaller than m.
We apply principal component analysis (PCA) [9, 11, 12]
to reduce the dimension of the distance matrix while re-
taining as much topological information as possible.
In a
nutshell, PCA transforms a data set that consists of a large
number of (possibly) correlated variables to a new set of un-
correlated variables, principal components, which can char-
acterize the network topology. The principal components
are ordered so that the ﬁrst several components have the
most important features of the original variables. The kth
principal component is interpreted as the direction of max-
imizing the variation of projections of measured distance
data while orthogonal to the ﬁrst (k − 1)th principal com-
ponents [11].
Example 2. Figure 2 gives an example of performing PCA
for two correlated variables, x1 and x2. With the use of
PCA, we obtain two principal components, pc1 and pc2.
As shown in Fig. 2, the ﬁrst principal component pc1 rep-
resents the direction of the maximum variance. The one-
dimensional linear representation is calculated by projecting
the original data onto pc1.
These principal components can be obtained by singular
value decomposition (SVD). The singular value decomposi-
tion of D in Eq. (2) is obtained by
D = U · W · V T ,

where U and V are column and row orthogonal matrices, and
σi’s are the singular values of D in the decreasing order (i.e.,
σi ≥ σj if i < j). Note that DT D = (U W V T )T (U W V T ) =
V (W T W )V T . This means that the eigenvectors of DT D
make up V with the associated (real nonnegative) eigen-
values of the diagonal of W T W [10]. Similarly, DDT =
U T (W W T )U . The columns of the m × m matrix U =
[ u1, . . . , um ] are the principal components and become the
orthogonal basis of the new subspace. By using the ﬁrst n
columns of U denoted by Un, we project the m-dimensional
space into a new n-dimensional space:
ci = U T
n · di = [ u1,
. . . , un ]
T · di.

system is how to determine the adequate degree, n, of di-
mensions in the coordinate system. Generally this prob-
lem of determining the number of principal components has
not been extensively studied, and is usually application-
dependent [13]. One of the commonly adopted criteria is the
cumulative percentage of variation that the selected princi-
pal components contribute [9]. The percentage, tk, of vari-
ation accounted for by the ﬁrst k principal components is
deﬁned by
tk = 100 ×

Usually a cut-oﬀ value, t∗
of cumulative percentage of varia-
tion is pre-determined, and n is determined to be the small-
est integer such that tn ≥ t∗
. In the previous example, t1 =
50%, t2 = 89%, t3 = 94 %, and t4 = 100 %. If t∗
is set to
80 %, then we have n = 2.
4.2 Experimental Results
To investigate whether or not PCA can be used to repre-
sent the network distances on the Internet in a coordinate
system of smaller dimensions and yet still retain as much
topological information as possible, we apply PCA to two
real-life data sets:
• NPD-Routes-2 data set [14]: contains Internet route
measurements obtained by traceroute. The measure-
ments were made between 33 Internet hosts in the Net-
work Probe Daemon (NPD) framework from Novem-
ber 3, 1995, to December 21, 1995. We obtain the
distance matrix D in Eq. (2) by taking (for each pair
of hosts) the minimum value of measured round trip
times (RTTs) in order to ﬁlter out queuing delay.
• NLANR: contains the RTT, packet loss, topology, and
on-demand throughput measurements made under the
Active Measurement Project (AMP) at National Labo-
ratory for Applied Network Research (NLANR). More
than 100 AMP monitors are used to make the measure-
ments [15]. The round trip times between all the mon-
itors are measured every minute, and are processed
once a day. We use one of the NLANR RTT data
sets measured between 113 AMP monitors on April 9,
2003.
We ﬁrst compare diﬀerent distance metrics with respect
to their quality of representing topological information. We
use three distance metrics, L1, L2, and L∞ in Eq. (3). We
calculate for each host the distances L1, L2, and L∞ to
all the other hosts, and determine its closest host based on
the distance calculated in the coordinate system. As the
”closest” host calculated under the various distance metrics
may not be the actual closest host, we deﬁne the notion of
proximity to measure the quality of representing topological
information. If the host calculated to be the closest is the

closest, the proximity is set to 1. Similarly, if the host cal-
culated to be the closest turns out to be the kth closest, the
proximity is k. We average, for each distance metric used,
the proximity over all the hosts.
Table 1 gives the average proximity in the original distance
space, whose dimension is m = 33 and 113 for the NPD and
NLANR data sets, respectively. In the NPD data set, L1
gives the best performance — the host calculated to be the
closest is the 5.818th closest host averagely. In the NLANR
data set, L∞ gives the best performance. These results show
that the accuracy of representing topological information
in a distance data space depends heavily on the distance
metric.
Next we study the (in)eﬀectiveness of using PCA to repre-
sent network distances. Figure 3 gives the average proximity
with respect to the number of principal components for the
NPD and NLANR data sets. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), when
the number of principal components is greater than 3, the
proximity is almost the same as that in the original distance
data space. This means that the topological information is
eﬀectively represented in a 3-dimensional space instead of
in a 33-dimensional space. Another important observation
is that the average proximity in the new coordinate system
of smaller dimensions remains the same regardless of the
distance metric used. The reason that the proximity is in-
dependent of the distance metric is due to the fact that PCA
ﬁnds a set of uncorrelated bases to represent the topological
information. A similar trend can be observed in Fig. 3 (b)
in which the proximity is almost the same as that in the
original distance data space when the number of principal
components is larger than 10.
Figure 4 plots the eigenvalues and their corresponding cu-
mulative percentage of variation. The largest eigenvalues are
4760.0 and 7787.3, respectively, for the NPD and NLANR
data sets. If we set a cut-oﬀ threshold of t∗
= 80 %, the
smallest value of n that achieves the threshold for each data
set is, respectively, 9 and 7. In this case, σ9 = 354.7, and
the average proximity is 6.54 for the NPD data set, and σ7
= 325.2 and the average proximity is 7.49 for the NLANR
data set.
In summary, we show in this section that the Internet dis-
tance can be modeled, with the use of PCA, in a Cartesian
space that uses a (smaller) set of uncorrelated bases. More-
over, we show that the new coordinate system is less suscep-
tible to the distance metrics used in representing topological
information.

5.1 Overview
INTERNET COORDINATE SYSTEM
We ﬁrst present a basic architecture for the Internet co-
ordinate system (ICS). As mentioned in Section 1, the ob-
jectives of ICS are i) to infer the network topology based on
delay measurement and ii) to estimate the distance between
hosts without direct measurement. Succinctly, the archi-
tecture for ICS consists of a number of beacon nodes, that
collect and analyze distance information. Figure 5 gives an
example architecture of ICS with ﬁve beacon nodes. Bea-
con nodes periodically measure round trip times (RTTs) to
other beacon nodes and construct a coordinate system. The
coordinates of beacon nodes are then calculated, with the
use of PCA, based on the measured RTT data among ﬁve
beacon nodes. We will elaborate on how to calculate the
coordinates of beacon nodes in Section 5.2.
An ordinary host determines its own location in ICS by
measuring its delays to either the entire or partial set of
beacon nodes and obtains a distance vector. As exempli-
ﬁed in Fig. 5, host 1 measures its distance to ﬁve beacon
nodes, and obtains a ﬁve-dimensional distance vector. The
location of the host in ICS is then calculated by multiply-
ing the distance vector with a transformation matrix. (We
will elaborate on how the transformation matrix is derived
and distributed in Section 5.3.) After calculating its own
coordinate, host 1 may report its coordinate to a DNS-like
server that keeps coordinates of ordinary hosts. To estimate
the network distance to some other host without direct mea-
surement, host 1 may query this DNS-like server which can
then easily determine the estimated distance as long the co-
ordinate of the other host is kept. In the same manner, host
1 can also infer which host is closer to itself.
5.2 Calculating the Coordinates of Beacon Nodes
We construct the Internet Coordinate system based on
the measured network distances between m beacon nodes.
PCA presented in Section 4 is applied to reduce the distance
data space to a new coordinate system of (much) smaller
dimensions.
Each beacon node measures its distances to the other bea-
con nodes, and obtains a m-dimensional distance vector di
in Eq. (1), of which the jth element dij is the measured
distance to the jth beacon node. An administrative node,
which can be elected among beacon nodes, aggregates the
distance vectors of all the beacon nodes, and obtains the
distance matrix D in Eq. (2). Then, the distance matrix is
decomposed into three matrices U , W , and V in Eq. (7).
Using the ﬁrst n principal components, the coordinate of
