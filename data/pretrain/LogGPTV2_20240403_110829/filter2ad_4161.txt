## Abstract
Most indoor localization algorithms rely on Received Signal Strength (RSS) signatures, which are annotated with their real recorded locations. However, our experiments show that RSS signatures are not suitable as the unique annotations (like fingerprints) for recorded locations. This study investigates the characteristics of RSS, such as how values change over time and between consecutive positions. Based on these characteristics, we design LuPI (Locating using Prior Information), which uses novel sensors integrated into smartphones to construct an RSS variation space (similar to a radio map) of a floor plan as prior information. The deployment of LuPI is easy and rapid, requiring minimal human intervention. In LuPI, the calibration of the "radio map" is crowd-sourced, automatic, and scheduled. Experimental results demonstrate that LuPI achieves comparable location accuracy to previous approaches, even without the statistical information from site surveys.

## 1. Introduction
The popularity of smart-device-based mobile and pervasive computing has spurred extensive research on wireless indoor localization. Leveraging the potential of sensor-embedded mobile devices, many solutions have been introduced to provide room-level location-based services, such as locating a person or a printer in an office building. Additionally, data collected from mobile phones can be used to uncover regular patterns and structures in the behavior of both individuals and crowds.

Received Signal Strength (RSS) is easily obtained from most off-the-shelf wireless equipment, such as WiFi- or ZigBee-compatible devices. However, using RSS as a database to support indoor localization (e.g., RSS fingerprint space) is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Our extensive experiments reveal that the RSS database is vulnerable due to environmental dynamics, as shown in Figure 1. These weaknesses are inherent in RSS-based approaches. To mitigate the impact of environmental changes on RSS absolute values, we exploit the relative change of RSS between different positions.

### Figure 1: Instability of RSS Values

In this study, we propose LuPI (Locating using Prior Information). The key idea of LuPI is that human motion can be distinguished and recorded by radio information (e.g., RSS deviation between different positions) and a pedometer (based on the accelerometer embedded in a smartphone). LuPI utilizes RSS and the sensor-based pedometer to build an RSS variation space as prior information. Then, based on this prior information, LuPI estimates the location of a mobile node. LuPI does not require prior knowledge of router locations, which are often unavailable in commercial or office buildings where routers are installed by different organizations. Furthermore, accessing these routers with passwords is unnecessary for LuPI.

To evaluate the performance of LuPI, we deployed a prototype system and conducted extensive experiments on the third floor of a medium-sized building.

## 2. Our Approach and Key Contributions
The steps of LuPI are as follows:

**Input:**
- One hundred RSS sets from three different WiFi routers at each step, [RSS1 = (rss1, rss2, rss3); RSS2; ...; RSS100].

**Step 1: Build the RSS Variation Space**
1. **Partitioning:** All RSS sets are partitioned into k clusters using k-means clustering, where each set belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The number of clusters, k, corresponds to the number of steps. Cluster centers are calculated for each step.
2. **Distance Matrix Calculation:** Calculate the distance matrix D = [dij]k×k, where dij represents the Euclidean distance between the cluster centers of steps i and j.
3. **Relative Coordinate Matrix Calculation:** Using MultiDimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm, calculate the relative coordinate matrix Y based on the distance matrix D.
4. **Coordinate Accumulation:** Accumulate coordinates and construct the RSS variation space. The elements of matrices D and Y form the RSS variation space.

**Step 2: Locate a Mobile Node Using the RSS Variation Space**
1. **Add Current RSS Set:** Add the current RSS set of the mobile node to the RSS variation space as a new element and update the distance matrix D.
2. **Update Relative Coordinates:** Calculate the new relative coordinate matrix Y based on the updated distance matrix. The mobile node can be located with a relative coordinate in the RSS variation space.

**Output:**
- The relative coordinate of a mobile node.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Room-Level Localization:** Experimental results show that LuPI achieves comparable location accuracy to previous approaches in rooms.
2. **Dynamic Adaptive Localization:** The calibration of the "radio map" is crowd-sourced and automatic.
3. **Mitigation of Environmental Impact:** LuPI is based on the RSS variation space, avoiding the use of RSS absolute values.
4. **Easy and Rapid Deployment:** LuPI requires minimal human intervention.

## 3. Preliminary Results
We developed the prototype of LuPI on the increasingly popular Android OS, which supports WiFi and accelerometer. Experiments were conducted in two laboratories, one of 84m² and another of 63m², each equipped with three WiFi routers without location information.

We sampled the experiment area every two grids (0.6m × 0.6m per grid) as a step. Only three volunteers were needed for the experiments. LuPI records pedometer readings to count walking distance and simultaneously picks up RSS values along the walking path. We implemented LiFS [3] and compared its performance with LuPI using the same experimental data. The average localization errors of LuPI were 1.39356 meters and 1.88574 meters for the two laboratories, respectively, which are smaller than LiFS's average localization error (about 5.88 meters). Even in the corridor, LuPI's performance is comparable to state-of-the-art model-based approaches (larger than 5 meters) reported in [2] and outperforms EZ (larger than 7 meters) [1].

We estimated 248 localization queries on LuPI. For the corridor and two rooms, we integrated all localization results (Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of localization error, as shown in Figure 2).

### Figure 2: CDF of Localization Error

- **(b) CDF of Localization Error in the Big Room**
- **(c) CDF of Localization Error in the Small Room**

For the big room, the localization error for 100% of queries is under 7.2 meters, while about 90% is under 4.8 meters. For the corridor, 69% of queries have a localization error under 6 meters. The accuracy of LuPI is impressive, as it requires no site survey and no specific infrastructure.

## 4. Conclusion
The average localization error is 5.91996 meters in the corridor, 1.39356 meters in the big room, and 1.88574 meters in the small room. Thus, LuPI achieves room-level localization accuracy. Moreover, the localization errors for 50% of queries are less than 2.4 meters in the corridor, less than 4.8 meters for 90% of queries in the big room, and less than 1.2 meters for 50% of queries in the small room.
