ABSTRACT
Most indoor localization algorithms are based on Received
Signal Strength (RSS), in which RSS signatures of an inter-
ested area are annotated with their real recorded locations.
However, according to our experiments, RSS signatures are
not suitable as the unique annotations (like Fingerprints) of
recorded locations. In this study, we investigate the char-
acteristics of RSS (e.g., how the RSS values change as time
goes on and between consecutive positions?). On this ba-
sis, we design LuPI (Locating using Prior Information) that
exploits the characteristics of RSS: with user motion, LuPI
uses novel sensors integrated in smartphones to construc-
t the RSS variation space (like radio map) of a (cid:13)oor plan
as prior information. The deployment of LuPI is easy and
rapid since little human intervention is needed. In LuPI, the
calibration of \radio map" is crowd-sourced, automatic and
scheduled. Experimental results show that LuPI achieves
comparable location accuracy to previous approaches, even
without the statistical information of site survey.

INTRODUCTION
The popularity of smart-device-based mobile and perva-
sive computing stimulates extensive research on wireless in-
door localization. Based on the potential functionality of
these sensor-embedded mobile devices, many solutions are
introduced to provide room-level location-based services, for
example, locating a person or a printer in an o(cid:14)ce building.
Even, data collection from mobile phones can be used to

uncover regular rules and structures in the behavior of both
individuals and crowds.
Received Signal Strength (RSS) is easily obtained from
most o(cid:11)-the-shelf wireless equipment (such as WiFi- or ZigBee-
compatible devices). However, considering RSS as a database
to support indoor localization (e.g., RSS (cid:12)ngerprint space)
is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Especially, from ex-
tensive experiments, we observe that the RSS database is
vulnerable due to environmental dynamics (an example is
shown in Figure 1). These weaknesses are inevitable for
RSS-based approaches. For mitigating the in(cid:13)uence of en-
vironmental changes on RSS absolute values, we exploit the
relative change of RSS between di(cid:11)erent positions.
Figure 1: Instability of RSS values
In this study, we propose LuPI (Locating using Prior In-
formation). The key idea of LuPI is that human motion can
be distinguished and recorded by radio information (e.g.,
RSS deviation between di(cid:11)erent positions) and a pedometer
(it is based on accelerometer embedded in a smartphone).
LuPI utilizes the RSS and the sensor-based pedometer to
build a RSS variation space as prior information. Then,
based on this prior information, LuPI estimates the loca-
tion of a mobile node. LuPI requires no prior knowledge of
router locations which are often unavailable in commercial
or o(cid:14)ce buildings where routers are installed by di(cid:11)erent
organizations. In addition, accessing these routers by pass-
word is also unnecessary for LuPI.
To estimate the performance of LuPI, we deployed a pro-
totype system and conducted extensive experiments on the
third (cid:13)oor of a middle-size building.

TIONS
The steps of LuPI are shown as follows.
Input: One
hundred RSS sets from three di(cid:11)erent WiFi routers at each
step, [RSS1 = (rss1; rss2; rss3); RSS2; :::; RSS100]. Step
1: Build the RSS variation space: (1) Partition all RSS set-
s into k clusters in which each set belongs to the cluster
with the nearest mean, using the k-means clustering, where
k is the number of steps. Moreover the cluster center can
be obtained for each step. (2) Calculate the distance ma-
trix D = [dij]k(cid:2)k. The elements of matrix D represent the
Euclidean distances between cluster centers, e.g., d12 is the
Euclidean distance between RSS sets of steps 1 and 2. (3)
Calculate the relative coordinate matrix Y concerning al-
l steps, using MultiDimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm,
based on the distance matrix D.
(4) Accumulate coordi-
nates and construct the RSS variation space. The elements
of matrices D and Y form the RSS variation space. Step
2: Locate a mobile node using the RSS variation space. (1)
Add the current RSS set of mobile node to the RSS variation
space as a new element, and update the distance matrix D.
(2) According to the new distance matrix, the new relative
coordinate matrix Y can be calculated. The mobile node
can be located with a relative coordinate in the RSS vari-
ation space. Output: The relative coordinate of a mobile
node.
The key contributions of LuPI are:
(1) It is a room-
level localization algorithm. Experimental results show that
LuPI achieves comparable location accuracy to previous ap-
proaches in the rooms. (2) It is a dynamic adaptive local-
ization algorithm. The calibration of \radio map" is crowd-
sourced and automatic. (3) It mitigates the impact of envi-
ronmental change on localization. LuPI is based on the RSS
variation space, and avoids the use of RSS absolute values.
(4) The deployment of LuPI is easy and rapid, and LuPI
only needs slight human intervention.
3. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
We develop the prototype of LuPI on the increasingly pop-
ular Android OS which supports WiFi and accelerometer.
We conducted the experiments in two laboratories of 84m2
and 63m2, where three WiFi routers without location infor-
mation were installed in each laboratory.
We sample the experiment area every two grids as a step
(0:6m (cid:2) 0:6m for one grid). Only three volunteers are need-
ed in the experiment. LuPI records the pedometer readings
(how many steps) to count the walking distance, and at the
same time LuPI picks up RSS values along the walking path.
We implement LiFS [3], and compare its performance with
LuPI on the same experiment data. The average localiza-
tion errors of LuIP are 1:39356 meters and 1:88574 meters
for two laboratories, respectively, which are smaller than
LiFS’s average localization error (about 5:88 meters). Even
in the corridor the performance of LuPI is comparable to
the state-of-the-art model-based approaches (larger than 5
meters) reported in [2], and outperforms EZ (larger than 7
meters) [1].
We estimate 248 localization queries on LuPI. For the cor-
ridor and two rooms we integrate all the localization results
(the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of localiza-
tion error (Figure 2)).
As shown in Figure 2, for the big room, the localization

error of 100% queries is under 7:2 meters while about 90%
is under 4:8 meters. For the corridor, the localization error:
69% queries is under 6 meters. The accuracy of LuIP is
impressive, as it needs no site survey and no speci(cid:12)c infras-
tructure.
4. CONCLUSION
The average localization error is 5:91996 meters in the
corridor, the average localization error is 1:39356 meters in
the big room, and the average localization error is 1:88574
meters in the small room. So the localization accuracy of
LuPI is room-level. Moreover, the localization errors of 50%
localization queries are less than 2:4 meters in the corridor,
and the localization errors of 90% localization queries are
less than 4:8 meters in the big room, and the localization
errors of 50% localization queries are less than 1:2 meters in
the small room.
