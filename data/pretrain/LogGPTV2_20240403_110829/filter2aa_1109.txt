Exploiting SCADA Systems

Attack Vectors via Software 
Vulnerabilities
Client-side attacks from web 
browsers, e-mail, and malicious 
servers
Server-side attacks from the 
internet or internal network
Clickjacking!?
So.. whats wrong?
Security has been implemented 
as an add-on instead of being 
build around the product from the 
ground up
Systems are typically installed for 
long term, and software upgrades 
may require new hardware
Something somewhere is 
connected to something that is 
connected to the Internet
Vendors can take their time with 
updates, and managers may also 
take their time updating
There are a ton of vulnerabilities 
in SCADA software!
Who may find the bugs?
Employees
Hackers (up to no good)
Security Researchers
Anyone who cares to look really..
Sploitware
A framework designed 
specifically to penetration test 
SCADA systems
Similar concept to Metasploit or 
CANVAS, yet focused on SCADA 
software
Can check systems for potentially 
vulnerable software
Exploitation is optional but readily 
available
Methods for identifying 
vulnerabilities? Manual testing to 
fuzzing to reverse engineering
R&D findings range from RCE to 
DoS to Integrity Loss
DEMO!
Recommendations
Vendors...
Try to break it before you ship it!
Clients...
Do a security evaluation before 
you make the purchase.
SCADA software can be just as 
vulnerable as your typical 
download.com application.
Thank you
