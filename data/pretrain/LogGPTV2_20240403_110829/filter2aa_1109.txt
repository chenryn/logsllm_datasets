#### Attack Vectors via Software Vulnerabilities

1. **Client-Side Attacks:**
   - Web browsers
   - Email
   - Malicious servers

2. **Server-Side Attacks:**
   - From the internet
   - From internal networks

3. **Clickjacking:**
   - A technique where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

#### The Problem with SCADA Security

- **Add-On Security:** Security is often implemented as an add-on rather than being integrated into the product from the ground up.
- **Long-Term Installation:** SCADA systems are typically installed for long periods, and software upgrades may require new hardware.
- **Connectivity Issues:** There is often a chain of connections that eventually leads to the Internet, increasing the attack surface.
- **Slow Update Cycles:** Vendors and managers may take their time with updates, leaving systems vulnerable.
- **Proliferation of Vulnerabilities:** SCADA software is rife with vulnerabilities.

#### Who Finds the Bugs?

- **Employees**
- **Hackers (with malicious intent)**
- **Security Researchers**
- **Anyone who cares to look**

#### Sploitware

- **Definition:** A framework specifically designed for penetration testing SCADA systems.
- **Comparison:** Similar to Metasploit or CANVAS, but focused on SCADA software.
- **Functionality:**
  - Checks systems for potentially vulnerable software.
  - Offers optional but readily available exploitation tools.
- **Methods for Identifying Vulnerabilities:**
  - Manual testing
  - Fuzzing
  - Reverse engineering
- **R&D Findings:**
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  - Denial of Service (DoS)
  - Integrity Loss

#### Recommendations

**For Vendors:**
- **Thorough Testing:** Ensure you rigorously test the security of your products before shipping them.

**For Clients:**
- **Security Evaluation:** Conduct a comprehensive security evaluation before purchasing SCADA software.
- **Awareness:** Understand that SCADA software can be just as vulnerable as any other application, such as those found on download.com.
