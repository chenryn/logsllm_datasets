### Issue: Setting Up Kivy with the Storage Module on Linux Mint 13

#### Problem Description
I am trying to set up Kivy on Linux Mint 13. I followed the instructions on the Kivy website, which involved adding the daily repository to `apt` and then using `apt-get` to install `python-kivy`. However, when I attempt to import the `JsonStore` module from `kivy.storage.jsonstore`, I encounter an `ImportError: No module named storage.jsonstore`.

I have verified that the `storage` directory, along with its files, is present in the `dist-packages/kivy` directory. It's worth noting that I used the daily repository because the stable version of Kivy does not include the storage module.

On my Windows machine, I was able to get the storage module to work by simply adding it to the Kivy directory, but this approach fails on Linux Mint.

#### Solution
To resolve this issue, I followed these steps:

1. **Remove the Existing Kivy Installation:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get remove python-kivy
   ```

2. **Remove the Stable Repository:**
   Ensure that the stable repository is removed from your `apt` sources. You can do this by editing the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file or any other relevant list file and removing the line that points to the Kivy stable repository.

3. **Add the Daily Repository:**
   Add the Kivy daily repository to ensure you get the latest features, including the storage module.
   ```sh
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kivy-team/kivy-daily
   ```

4. **Update the Package List:**
   Update the package list to include the new repository.
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

5. **Install Kivy:**
   Install Kivy from the daily repository.
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install python-kivy
   ```

After following these steps, I was able to install Kivy version 1.8.0, which includes the storage module. There are some minor differences between this version and the stable 1.7.2 version, but they were not significant for my use case.

#### Explanation
The stable version 1.7.2 of Kivy does not include the storage module in its `setup.py` file, so it is not compiled with it. By using the daily repository, you can access the latest features and modules, including the storage module.

This solution should help you get the storage module working on your Linux Mint 13 system.
