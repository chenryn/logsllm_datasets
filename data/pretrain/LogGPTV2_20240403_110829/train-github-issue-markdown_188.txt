This constraint was thought-out to be used directly on a entity. But in
several cases, i used it without a doctrine entity, for example when the form
has fields for diferents entities.
In this case i want to have the way to specify not only the field also the
entity that belongs the field.
I think that the change will be easy, so i will send a PR soon.
I think that the PR will be on 2.8 it is?
Regards!
