Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

This constraint was originally designed to be used directly on an entity. However, in several instances, I have applied it without a Doctrine entity, such as when a form contains fields from different entities.

In these cases, I would like to have the ability to specify not only the field but also the entity to which the field belongs.

I believe this change will be straightforward, and I plan to submit a pull request (PR) soon. I assume the PR should target the 2.8 version, correct?

Best regards!
