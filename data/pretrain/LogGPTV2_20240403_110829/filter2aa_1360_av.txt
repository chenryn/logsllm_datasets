Mac & Windows Issues
114 Chapter 6
You will likely encounter undesired issues within your own OS1NT Mac and Windows builds which are not 
present within the Linux VM. Most of these will be related to security' or missing dependencies.
These commands are at the end of the "windows.txt" file. Your Windows operat 
way it was before replicating the methods in this chapter. There will still be evidenceof these installations within 
your standard operating system file structure. However, the applications and all visual clues should now be gone. 
The following page presents a summary’ of the custom applications which are now available within y’our Mac 
and Windows systems. These are slightly different than the Linux options previously presented. Specifically, 
WebScreenShot replaces EyeWitness, and Recon-ng is not available within Windows. Everything else should 
function die same as the Linux versions of the scripts. Hopefully, this prevents barriers between y7our OSINT 
investigations and the Python scripts which aid our efforts.

programs, i e structure issues, authorization permissions, and coundess other issues might prevent your

Linux virtual machine for my investigations. However, don't let the lack of Linux within your arsenal

Android Emulation 115
CHAPTER SEVEN
ANDROID EMULATION
The previous editions of this book focused heavily on Genymotion as an Android emulator. This cross-platform 
software allowed us to easily create virtual Android environments which appeared as magical mobile devices on 
our screens. 1 no longer recommend Genymotion as our best initial option, but it will be explained later within 
this chapter. The main reason 1 no longer begin with Genymotion is because it is simply no longer needed due 
to the availability of other options, which 1 present in a moment.
The idea of Android emulation is to recreate the mobile operating experience within an application on your 
computer. This application will execute in the same manner that your web browser, word processor, or email 
client would open. It will have the exact same appearance as if you were staring at a telephone or tablet. Any 
actions that you take within this emulated device will not affect anything else on your computer. Think of it as 
an encapsulated box, and nothing comes in or gets out, very similar to our Linux VM previously explained. A 
great feature of emulation is that you can create unlimited virtual devices. You could have one for every 
investigation in order to prevent any contamination.
Privacy and security are also important reasons to consider emulation versus directly investigating from a 
portable device. I have seen many law enforcement investigators conduct a search or use an app directly from 
their personal or work phones. This opens that device to scrutiny and discovery. An attorney could rightfully 
request a copy of the investigator's phone in order to conduct an independent forensic analysis. That would 
make most people nervous. Additionally, if I encounter malicious software or a virus from my portable device, 
it could affect all future investigations using that hardware. Emulation will remedy both of these situations.
This chapter will focus on the huge amount of information available through mobile platforms that is not 
accessible through a web browser. I will explain a method of emulating a portable device within a traditional 
computer. Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of making things work, we should discuss why emulation is 
the way to go. In my investigations, documentation is my primary reason for launching a simulated mobile device 
within my computer operating system. If I conducted my investigation on an actual smartphone, documenting 
my findings can be difficult. Mobile screen captures only cover a small amount of visible content. Extracting 
any captured images can be a hassle. Referencing my findings within a final report can become very tedious. 
When using Android emulation within my traditional computer, I can easily create numerous screen captures, 
record a video of my entire investigation, and paste my results directly into the report.
Some readers will question why I chose to explain Android emulation instead of iPhone. The most obvious 
reason is the number of options. I will explain software solutions for recreating the Android environment on 
your computer. An iPhone simulator will only function on Apple computers and has very limited features. The 
Android techniques will work on any major operating system. Additionally, we can create Android virtual 
machines that possess all original functionality. An iPhone simulator will not connect to most applications and 
features, and provides almost no value to the OSINT investigator.
For several years, online researchers have been navigating through various social networking websites for 
information about individuals. Whether it was older sites such as Friendster and Myspace, or current networks 
such as Twitter and Facebook, we have always flocked to our web browsers to begin extracting data. Times have 
changed. Today, an entire generation of social network users rarely touch a traditional computer. They operate 
completely from a cellular telephone or tablet. Many of the networks through which individuals engage will only 
operate on a mobile device. Services such as Snapchat, Tinder, and Kik do not allow a user to access content 
from a traditional web browser. As this shift occurs, investigators must transition with it. Our preparation is not 
complete until we have disposable Android environments in place.
If downloading an "ova" file, such as provided by from Linux VM Images, conduct the following.
116 Chapter?
• 
Open VirtualBox and select "File" then "Import Appliance" within the menu.
• 
Next to "File", click the folder icon to the right.
• 
Select the "ova" file previously downloaded and decompressed (unzipped).
• 
Click "Open", then "Continue", then "Import".
• 
If prompted, agree and acknowledge any terms of sendee.
• 
Right-click on the new virtual device and choose "Settings".
• 
If desired, rename the device, such as "Android 9.0 VM (OVA)".
• 
Click "System" and choose a memory size of at least 4096 MB (preferably 8192 MB).
Hopefully, you already have VirtualBox installed and configured. If not, please revisit Chapter Two and return 
to this chapter. The remaining text will assume that your installation of VirtualBox is functioning. Next, we need 
an Android image, much like we downloaded a Linux Ubuntu file in order to create a custom OSINT Linux 
VM. There are two trusted sources for Android images configured for VirtualBox, as follows.
There are other specific reasons as to why many readers no longer use Genymotion within their investigations 
and training. The company has started to make the free version of the application difficult to find and enforces 
strict licensing rules which may prohibit usage by some OSINT practitioners. I also find that many mobile 
applications block virtual devices built through Genymotion software. This often results in application crashes 
immediately upon load. Genymotion also now requires an online account in order to download any software, 
and forces users to supply these account details when launching the application. This then sends data about your 
usage to their servers, which is not ideal. Fortunately, we can avoid all of these pitfalls by building our own 
Android devices directly through VirtualBox without the need for third-party' container software. Furthermore, 
we will build our Android devices without the need to enter Google account details. This is another 
improvement from the previous edition.
OS Boxes: https://w’\vw.osboxes.org/android-x86/
Linux VM Images: https://w'ww.linuxvmimages.com/images/android-x86/
I always download the latest version in 64-bit format. At the time of this writing, I downloaded Android-x86 
9.0 R2 Pie for VirtualBox. This is the second stable release for the Android 9.0, code named Pie, for 64-bit 
computers with VirtualBox. OS Boxes offers builds specifically designed for VMWare if you prefer that 
platform. Linux VM Images typically only offer VirtualBox builds. Once you have downloaded your desir 
Android image, decompress the file (unzip) and store it somewhere easily accessible. You are now ready to 
configure your first virtual device. If dow’nloading a "vdi" file, such as provided from OS Boxes, conduct e 
following.
• 
Open VirtualBox and select "New".
• 
Provide a name, such as "Android 9.0 VM".
• 
Provide your desired storage location.
• 
Choose a "Type" of "Other" and "Version" of "Other/Unknown (64-bit)".
• 
Click "Continue".
• 
Choose a memory’ size of at least 4096 MB (preferably 8192 MB), and click "Continue".
• 
Select "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" and click the folder icon to the right.
• 
Click "Add" and select the unzipped "vdi" file which you previously downloaded.
• 
Click "Open", then "Choose", then click "Create".
• 
Right-click on the new virtual device and choose "Settings".
• 
Click "Processor" and choose half of your available processor cores.
• 
Click "Display" and choose the maximum video memory’.
• 
Click "OK".

You may have noticed that once you click inside the Android VM, your cursor is stuck within the window. This 
makes it seem impossible to return to the other applications within your computer or to close die virtual 
machine. The solution is to unlock your cursor with whatever "Host Key" is set for your computer. In Figure 
7.01, you can see "Left" followed by the logo for the "command" key within Apple keyboards. This indicates 
that pressing the left command key releases my cursor to my host computer. Be sure to note what key is required 
on your computer. Most Windows machines default to the right "Ctrl" key.
