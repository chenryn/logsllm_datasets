### Updating and Managing Python Tools on Windows

To keep your Python tools up to date, follow these steps. You can either launch the shortcut titled "Updates" or enter the following commands in Command Prompt with administrative privileges. The script runs with administrative privileges by default.

1. **Update Downloader for Reddit:**
   ```sh
   unzip -o DownloaderForReddit.zip
   del *.zip
   ```

2. **Update Spiderfoot:**
   ```sh
   cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\spiderfoot
   git pull https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot.git
   ```

3. **Update Elasticsearch-Crawler:**
   ```sh
   cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\Elasticsearch-Crawler
   git pull https://github.com/AmIJesse/Elasticsearch-Crawler.git
   ```

4. **Update Ghunt:**
   ```sh
   cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\ghunt
   git pull https://github.com/mxrch/ghunt.git
   ```

These commands are also available at the bottom of the `windows.txt` file on my website. If any changes occur, I will update the information there, and you can apply it to your script.

### Reversing All Changes (Windows)

To reverse all changes, enter the following commands in a Command Prompt with administrative privileges:

```sh
py -m pip uninstall pip requests aiodns youtube-tool instalooter Instaloader toutatis nested-lookup internetarchive webscreenshot readitsfinder socialscan holehe waybackpy gallery-dl xeuledoc bdfr search-that-hash h8mail -y
```

Then, navigate to each directory and uninstall the required packages:

```sh
cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\Osintgram
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\Sherlock
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\WhatsMyName
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\email2phonenumber
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\Sublist3r
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\Photon
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\theHarvester
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\Carbon14
python -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\sherloq\gui
python -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\metagoofil
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\bulk-downloader-for-reddit
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\recon-ng
py -m pip uninstall -r REQUIREMENTS -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\spiderfoot
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs\ghunt
py -m pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

cd %userprofile%\Desktop
del *.lnk

rmdir /Q /S %userprofile%\Documents\windows-files\
rmdir /Q /S %userprofile%\Downloads\Programs
choco uninstall all
rmdir /Q /S \ProgramData\chocolatey
```

Your system should now be back to its original state, though there may still be some evidence of the installations within your standard operating system file structure. The applications and visual clues should be removed.

### Mac & Windows Issues

You may encounter issues within your OSINT builds on Mac and Windows that are not present in the Linux VM. Most of these issues are related to security or missing dependencies.

#### macOS
- Some utilities installed via Homebrew may be blocked from opening. For example, "phantomjs" might be blocked when launching the Internet Archive script. To resolve this, go to "System Preferences" > "Security & Privacy" > "General" and click "Open Anyway."

#### Windows
- You may receive warnings about running unrecognized apps. Click "Run Anyway" the first time each script is executed to resolve this issue.
- Some applications, such as Osintgram, may fail due to conflicts with Python 3.9. I have modified my scripts to include redundant steps to resolve most issues, but some applications may still perform poorly. I will continue to provide updates on my website.

Overall, neither Mac nor Windows can fully replicate the Linux VM. Windows users, in particular, may face many issues due to Python conflicts, missing dependencies, outdated programs, and other issues. For these reasons, I always prefer a Linux virtual machine for my investigations. However, don't let the lack of Linux prevent you from attempting these features. Create the OSINT environment that best suits your needs.

### Android Emulation

#### Introduction

Previous editions of this book focused on Genymotion as an Android emulator. While Genymotion is still a viable option, it is no longer my primary recommendation due to the availability of other options, which I will explain in this chapter.

Android emulation allows you to recreate the mobile operating experience within an application on your computer. This application will function similarly to your web browser, word processor, or email client, and will have the same appearance as a real mobile device. Actions taken within the emulated device do not affect your host computer, making it a secure and isolated environment.

#### Benefits of Emulation

- **Privacy and Security:** Emulation prevents your personal or work devices from being scrutinized during investigations. It also protects against malware and viruses.
- **Documentation:** Emulation makes it easier to document findings through screen captures and video recordings.
- **Compatibility:** Android techniques work on any major operating system, unlike iPhone simulators which are limited to Apple computers.

#### Setting Up Android Emulation

1. **Download and Import an Android Image:**
   - **Using an OVA File:**
     1. Open VirtualBox and select "File" > "Import Appliance."
     2. Click the folder icon next to "File" and select the OVA file.
     3. Click "Open," then "Continue," then "Import."
     4. Right-click on the new virtual device and choose "Settings."
     5. Rename the device if desired, e.g., "Android 9.0 VM (OVA)."
     6. Set the memory size to at least 4096 MB (preferably 8192 MB).

   - **Using a VDI File:**
     1. Open VirtualBox and select "New."
     2. Provide a name, such as "Android 9.0 VM."
     3. Choose a storage location.
     4. Select "Type" as "Other" and "Version" as "Other/Unknown (64-bit)."
     5. Set the memory size to at least 4096 MB (preferably 8192 MB).
     6. Select "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" and choose the VDI file.
     7. Click "Create."
     8. Right-click on the new virtual device and choose "Settings."
     9. Set the processor cores and maximum video memory.

2. **Configure the Virtual Device:**
   - Click and hold any undesired home icons and drag them up to remove them.
   - Drag the bottom black bar up to display all applications.
   - Drag desired apps to the home screen, such as Chrome and Settings.
   - Open the Settings app, choose "Display," and change the "Sleep" to 30 minutes.
   - Ensure "Screen Lock" is set to "None" and "Location" is set to "On."

3. **Launch and Use the Virtual Device:**
   - Double-click the new Android virtual device to launch it.
   - Adjust the display size by selecting "View" > "Virtual Screen" > "Scale to 150%."

#### Common Applications for OSINT

- **Social Media:** Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Tinder, Skout, Plenty of Fish, Meetup, Badoo, Tango
- **Utilities:** Fake GPS, Secure Eraser, Kik, TikTok, Discord, Viber, TextNow, Truecaller, ProtonMail, Wire, Wickr, Telegram, Twitch, YouTube

By following these steps, you should have a functioning Android emulator ready for your OSINT investigations.
