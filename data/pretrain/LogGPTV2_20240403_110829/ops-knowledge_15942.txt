User: When I open a terminal on JupyterHub and try to run commands that I've placed in the machine's path, it says "command not found." 
The default PATH variable on Jupyterhub terminal seems to be /sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin and I'm wondering why it doesn't use the PATH as defined on the machine. Is there a way to get it to inherit this PATH, or to run some command like source /etc/environment whenever a terminal is generated?
Assistant: Turns out that when you edit /etc/bash.bashrc on the machine to include the PATH variable, it then persists in the Jupyterhub terminal
