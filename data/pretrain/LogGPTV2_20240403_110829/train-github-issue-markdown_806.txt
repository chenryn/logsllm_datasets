Hello,
I didn't find a previous discussion about this subject.  
Here is the code:
    Class Test {
        private _test:string;
        public test:number;
        constructor() {
             this._test="";
             this.test=1;
             this.test2="";  // error: must be declared, but it should guess the typing is string and public
             this._test3 : string[]; // invalid for now: could be private string[]
             this.test4 : string[];  // invalid for now: could be public string[]
            private this.test5 : string[];  // invalid for now: could be public string[], but modified to private
         }
    }
Do you plan to support such a feature ? I mean this._test3,this.test4 and
this.test5  
Are you working on this.test2 to add better intellisense for both ts and js
(this.test2 shows any in vscode) ?
Thanks in advance for your answers.
