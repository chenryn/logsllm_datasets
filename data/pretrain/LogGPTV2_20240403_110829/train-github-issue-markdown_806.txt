Subject: Inquiry About Future Support for Enhanced Typing and IntelliSense Features

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I have not found any previous discussions regarding the specific features I am about to mention, so I would like to bring them to your attention.

Below is a code snippet that highlights the issues I encountered:

```typescript
class Test {
    private _test: string;
    public test: number;

    constructor() {
        this._test = "";
        this.test = 1;
        
        // Error: 'test2' must be declared, but it should infer the type as a public string
        this.test2 = ""; 

        // Invalid: 'this._test3' should be a private string array
        this._test3: string[];

        // Invalid: 'this.test4' should be a public string array
        this.test4: string[];

        // Invalid: 'this.test5' should be a private string array, but is currently public
        private this.test5: string[];
    }
}
```

### Questions:
1. **Enhanced Typing Inference:**
   - Do you plan to support a feature where `this.test2` can be automatically inferred as a `public string` without an explicit declaration?
   - Similarly, do you plan to support automatic inference for `this._test3` and `this.test4` as `private string[]` and `public string[]` respectively?

2. **IntelliSense Improvements:**
   - Are there any ongoing efforts to improve IntelliSense for both TypeScript and JavaScript? Specifically, in Visual Studio Code, `this.test2` currently shows as `any`, which is not ideal.

Thank you in advance for your responses. I look forward to your insights on these matters.

Best regards,
