Hello,

I'm new to Flutter and I'm encountering an issue while trying to work offline. Every time I disconnect from the internet, I am unable to create a new project. I found information online about using the `--offline` flag, but I'm not sure where to add it. 

Could you please provide guidance on how to use the `--offline` flag in Flutter? I am using Windows.

Thank you!
