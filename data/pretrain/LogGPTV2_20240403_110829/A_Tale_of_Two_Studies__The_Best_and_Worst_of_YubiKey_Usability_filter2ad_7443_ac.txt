### Improving Instructions and Links

Participants suggested that the instructions could be enhanced by incorporating video tutorials. Additionally, six participants (19%) noted that the links and instructions they encountered were outdated and should be updated.

### How Does a YubiKey Enhance Account Security?

All but one participant (30; 96%) demonstrated a basic understanding of how a YubiKey enhances account security:

- **A11:** "It requires both a password and a physical key to access an account. Even if someone hacks your password, they still won't be able to get in without the key."
- **A21:** "A YubiKey provides an extra layer of protection that cannot be compromised through hacking because it is an external device that generates a unique code each time you log in."

### Measuring Day-to-Day Usability—Methodology

While the laboratory study identified clear issues with setting up a U2F security key, it was insufficient for exploring the day-to-day usability of security keys. To better understand this, we conducted an IRB-approved longitudinal study, tasking participants with using a YubiKey to authenticate their personal Google, Facebook, and Windows 10 accounts.

#### A. Study Design

The longitudinal study ran over two months, from July 12, 2017, to September 6, 2017. Participants committed to using a YubiKey for four weeks and completed a post-study interview. Twenty-five participants completed the study and were compensated $75 USD each.

Each study began with an in-person meeting where the study coordinator explained what a YubiKey is and how it would be used. Participants were assigned either a YubiKey NEO or a YubiKey Nano (Figure 1). Eleven participants (44%) used the YubiKey NEO, and fourteen (56%) used the YubiKey Nano. All participants returned the YubiKey at the end of the study.

After selecting a YubiKey, the study coordinator helped participants configure it with their Google, Facebook, and Windows 10 accounts. In five cases, the study coordinator was unable to set up YubiKey for Windows Hello on the participant's machine. These participants completed the study using the YubiKey for only their Google and Facebook accounts.

The study coordinator then guided participants through using the YubiKey to authenticate to each account, ensuring they understood the process. We did not test authentication on mobile devices, so coordinators helped participants learn to authenticate via SMS on their smartphones.

Participants were given an authentication journal and instructed to record notable experiences. Unlike Hayashi and Hong’s [29] password study, we did not require participants to record every login attempt. After the initial setup, participants were free to leave and begin using the YubiKey.

At the end of the four-week study, participants returned for a semi-structured post-study exit interview. They shared their experiences, both positive and negative, and provided suggestions for improving support for security keys and the YubiKey itself. Participants also provided demographic information and completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. The coordinator then helped participants remove YubiKey-based authentication from each account and collected the YubiKeys.

#### B. Data Analysis

We conducted an inductive analysis of the final interviews, similar to Egelman et al. [22]. Two researchers independently listened to audio recordings of each interview and took detailed notes. We identified the most salient themes and compiled a codebook of 26 codes based on these themes.

Three researchers independently coded the interviews, and we used Fleiss’ kappa scores to measure inter-rater reliability. Kappa values ranged from 0.56 to 1, with a mean of 0.70 and a median of 0.68, indicating substantial agreement. Coding discrepancies were resolved by majority vote and consultation of the audio recordings.

#### C. Participant Safety

To minimize potential harm, we took several precautions:
1. Participants received sealed instructions on how to disable the YubiKey.
2. Both SMS and backup codes 2FA options were enabled for Google and Facebook.
3. Participants were provided with a phone number for technical support.
4. Contact numbers for several study coordinators were given for emergency assistance.

For Windows 10, we required participants to use YubiKey for Windows Hello, as the Windows Logon Authorization Tool posed unacceptable risks, such as disrupting features and potentially locking users out of their computers.

#### D. Recruitment

We recruited 25 participants using posters on the Brigham Young University campus. Participants, referred to as B1–B25, were required to have Google and Facebook accounts and own a Windows 10 laptop.

#### E. Demographics

Participants skewed slightly male: 56% male, 44% female. All participants were young adults: 84% aged 18–25, 16% aged 26–35. Most had some college education but no degree (80%), while 8% had a bachelor's degree and 12% had a post-graduate degree. Most reported having an intermediate level of computer expertise: 4% beginner, 68% intermediate, 28% advanced.

#### F. Limitations

The study population was drawn from a college campus, limiting generalizability. Future research could replicate this study with different populations. Additionally, Windows 10 authentication using the YubiKey was single-factor, which minimized harm but requires further exploration for day-to-day operating system authentication.

### Measuring Day-to-Day Usability—Results

During the study, only two participants requested assistance. One asked about using the YubiKey to log into Gmail on their phone, and the other reported that the YubiKey no longer worked with Windows 10. The latter issue was unresolved, and the participant continued using the YubiKey for Google and Facebook.

Participants encountered various errors when using the YubiKey, particularly with Windows 10. However, most issues were quickly resolved by refreshing the page, reinserting the YubiKey, or restarting the browser.

#### A. SUS Scores

Eleven participants rated the YubiKey NEO with a mean SUS score of 76.4 (SD = 15.7), and fourteen rated the YubiKey Nano with a mean SUS score of 71.9 (SD = 9.6). Overall, the YubiKey received a mean SUS score of 73.9 (SD = 12.5), considered "acceptable" and receiving a B grade.

#### B. Trade-offs Between Security and Convenience

Five participants (20%) mentioned previous unauthorized attempts to access their accounts or knew someone whose account had been compromised. These participants felt that adding 2FA would secure their accounts against future attacks. In contrast, YubiKey for Windows Hello increased convenience but reduced security, especially for the YubiKey Nano, which can be left in the machine.

#### C. Desire to Continue Using the YubiKey

Fourteen participants (56%) indicated they would like to continue using a YubiKey for 2FA. Six (24%) inquired about purchasing a YubiKey, highlighting its added security benefits.

#### D. No Need to Further Protect Their Accounts

Ten participants (40%) did not want to continue using the YubiKey, as they felt their accounts were of low value or contained nothing of significant importance. However, all six mentioned they would consider using a YubiKey if they became responsible for more sensitive information.

#### E. Sharing Accounts Between Users

Three participants (12%) discussed the difficulty of sharing accounts, particularly with a spouse. This led to challenges in accessing accounts and unexpected interactions, such as borrowing the YubiKey or using backup 2FA schemes.

#### F. YubiKey Inserting Gibberish Text

Six participants (24%) reported that the YubiKey occasionally inserted random text into applications, caused by accidentally touching the button. This behavior, though recognized, was found to be annoying.

#### G. YubiKey Nano Portability Issues

Participants assigned the YubiKey Nano reported issues related to its small size. Eight of 14 participants found it insufficiently portable, and three were reluctant to dedicate a USB port to the YubiKey Nano.

#### H. Concerns About Device Loss

Eight participants (32%) expressed concern about losing the YubiKey. Backup authentication schemes, though less secure, provided a solution. Five participants (20%) expressed interest in having another YubiKey for sharing or backup.

#### I. Comparison to Other Forms of 2FA

Thirteen participants (52%) preferred using the YubiKey to other forms of 2FA, citing its convenience and speed. Four participants (16%) preferred other forms of 2FA.

#### J. Security Keys on Mobile

All but one participant used other 2FA methods for mobile authentication. One participant discovered that the YubiKey NEO supported NFC and was very positive about this experience.

### Discussion

Our studies revealed significant differences between the setup and day-to-day usage phases of 2FA. While the setup phase presented significant usability challenges, the day-to-day usage was generally well-received. This highlights the importance of examining both phases to gain a comprehensive understanding of security key usability.
