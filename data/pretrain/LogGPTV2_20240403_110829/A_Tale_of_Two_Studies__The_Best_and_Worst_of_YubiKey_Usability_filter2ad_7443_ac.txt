that the instructions could be improved through the addition
of video tutorials. Finally, six participants (6; 19%) noted that
the links and instructions they had found were out-of-date and
that they should be updated.
(3) How does a YubiKey make an account safer? All but
one participant (30; 96%) demonstrated a basic understanding
that the YubiKey made their account safer:
A11: “It requires both a password and a physical
key to get into an account. Someone could hack your
basic password but without the key they still wouldn’t
be able to get in.”
A21: “A YubiKey is an extra layer of protection
that cannot be accessed via hacking because it is an
external device that generates a unique code each
time you log in.”
VI. MEASURING DAY-TO-DAY
USABILITY—METHODOLOGY
While the laboratory study identiﬁed clear problems with
setting up a U2F security key, it was insufﬁcient to explore
the usability of security keys in day-to-day use. To better
explore the daily usability of security keys, we conducted an
IRB-approved longitudinal study tasking participants with using
a YubiKey to authenticate to their personal Google, Facebook
and Windows 10 accounts.
A. Study Design
the course of
The longitudinal study ran over
two
months—beginning July 12, 2017, and ending September 6,
2017. Participation involved a four-week commitment to use a
YubiKey with the participant’s personal Google, Facebook, and
Windows 10 accounts and ended with a post-study interview.
In total, 25 participants completed the study and were each
compensated $75 USD.10
Each study began with an in-person meeting between the
study coordinator and the participant. During this meeting, the
study coordinator explained what a YubiKey was and how they
would be using it over the next four weeks. Participants were
assigned to use either a YubiKey NEO or a YubiKey Nano
(see Figure 1) to use for the duration of the study. The NEO
is physically identical to the YubiKey 4 used in the ﬁrst study
and the Nano is thumbnail sized.11 Eleven participants (11;
44%) used the YubiKey NEO and fourteen (14; 56%) used
the YubiKey Nano. Participants used the same device for the
entire study and every participant returned the YubiKey.
After selecting a YubiKey form factor, the study coordinator
helped participants to conﬁgure it with their Google, Facebook,
and Windows 10 accounts (using YubiKey for Windows Hello).
In ﬁve cases, the study coordinator was unable to set up
YubiKey for Windows Hello on the participant’s machine. These
participants completed the study using the YubiKey for only
their Google and Facebook accounts.
After setting up the participants’ YubiKey,
the study
coordinator walked participants through using the YubiKey
to authenticate to each account and conﬁrmed that participants
understood how to use the YubiKey. We were not testing
authentication on mobile devices and coordinators helped
participants learn to authenticate via SMS on their smartphones.
Participants were then given an authentication journal and
10Participants were free to withdraw from the study at any time and receive
prorated compensation, though no participant choose to withdraw.
11The difference between the YubiKey 4 and the NEO is the image on the
button and the fact that the NEO can also communicate via NFC.

instructed to write down notable experiences they had while
using the YubiKey [18]. Unlike Hayashi and Hong’s [29]
password study, we did not request that participants record
every login attempt in their journal. At this point, participants
were free to leave and begin using the YubiKey.
At the completion of the four-week study, participants
returned for a semi-structured post-study exit interview. In the
interview, participants were asked to share their experiences
using the YubiKey, both positive and negative. The study
coordinator conducting the interviews referenced the journals to
guide his discussion of their experiences. They were also asked
how they thought the support for security keys and the YubiKey
itself could be improved. During this exit interview, participants
also provided demographic information and completed the
SUS questionnaire. Finally, the coordinator helped participants
remove YubiKey-based authentication from each account and
collected the YubiKeys.
B. Data Analysis
Similar to the approach used by Egelman et al. [22], we
conducted an inductive analysis of the ﬁnal interviews. Two
researchers independently listened to audio recordings of each
interview and took detailed notes. We then identiﬁed the most
salient themes and compiled a codebook of 26 codes based on
these themes.
Three researchers then independently listened to the audio
recording of each interview and coded the interview. We
used Fleiss’ kappa scores to measure the inter-rater reliability
between the three coders. Kappa values ranged from 0.56 to
1 with a mean of 0.70 and a median of 0.68.12 This mean
falls into the category of ”substantial agreement” as described
by Landis and Koch [30]. The three coders addressed coding
discrepancies by majority vote and by consulting the audio
recordings for clariﬁcation. Our results are based on these
reconciled codes.
C. Participant Safety
Because participants were using their personal accounts,
we took signiﬁcant precautions to minimize potential harm
to participants. Our IRB provided external validation that our
efforts to protect our participants were sufﬁcient and complete.
First, participants were given a sealed set of instructions
detailing how to disable the YubiKey from their accounts
should they want to exit the study early. Second, we enabled
both the SMS and backup codes 2FA options for Google
and Facebook so participants could access their account if the
YubiKey was not functioning or unavailable. Third, participants
were provided with a phone number that they could call at any
time to receive technical support. Fourth, all participants were
given the telephone numbers of several study coordinators
in case they required emergency assistance to access their
accounts.
Finally, to minimize harm in Windows 10 we required
that participants use YubiKey for Windows Hello. While the
12We dropped six results where the kappa score was low (<0.5).
two-factor authentication of the Windows Logon Authorization
Tool would have been preferable and had even been approved
by our IRB, we decided to amend our protocol for two reasons.
First, the Windows Logon Authorization Tool requires that users
unlink their Windows account from their Microsoft account.
This had an unacceptable risk of causing harm to users by
disrupting Windows features and applications that relied on a
linked Microsoft account—for example, automatic ﬁle backup
using OneDrive. Second, the Windows Logon Authorization
Tool allows users to permanently lock themselves out of their
computer if conﬁgured incorrectly, which was deemed to be too
risky for the study. Additionally, YubiKey for Windows Hello
allowed users to continue using their password as a backup
means to authenticate to their device in case the YubiKey was
not functioning or unavailable.
Although backup authentication modes were available for
all accounts, participants were instructed to use the YubiKey
to authenticate whenever possible.
D. Recruitment
We recruited 25 participants using posters (available in the
appendix) on the Brigham Young University campus. We
speciﬁed that participants, referred to hereafter as B1–B25,
must have Google and Facebook accounts and own a Windows
10 laptop.
E. Demographics
Participants in our second study skewed slightly male: male
(14; 56%), female (11; 44%). All participants were young
adult: 18–25 years (21; 84%), 26–35 years (4; 16%). Four-ﬁfths
of the participants had completed some college but did not
yet have a degree: some college with no degree (20; 80%),
bachelor degree (2; 8%), post-graduate degree (3; 12%). Most
participants reported having an intermediate level of computer
expertise: beginner (1; 4%), intermediate (17; 68%), advanced
(7; 28%).
F. Limitations
The study population was drawn from a college campus, so
the results are not generalizable. Future research could replicate
this study with different populations to gain additional insights
into the usability of security keys in day-to-day usage.
Windows 10 authentication using the YubiKey was only
single-factor authentication. While this was necessary to
minimize harm to participants, future work needs to be done
to better explore the usability of security keys for day-to-day
authentication to the operating system.
VII. MEASURING DAY-TO-DAY USABILITY—RESULTS
During the study, only two participants phoned study
coordinators requesting assistance. In the ﬁrst case,
the
participant asked how to use the YubiKey to log into Gmail on
their phone. As we were not exploring this interaction in this
study, the study coordinator told the participant how to log into
Gmail using the backup 2FA options. In the second case, the
participant reported that the YubiKey no longer worked with

Windows 10. The study coordinators were unable to solve this
problem; this participant was instructed to continue using the
YubiKey with only their Google and Facebook accounts.
During the study, participants encountered a variety of errors
when attempting to authenticate using the YubiKey. Rarely,
users were unable to authenticate to Google or Facebook with
the YubiKey, even though they were using it correctly. However,
these problems were quickly resolved by refreshing the page,
reinserting the YubiKey, or restarting the browser. In contrast,
nearly every user reported having a problem at some point using
the YubiKey to log into Windows 10, with many reporting that
the problems occurred frequently. In these cases, participants
would temporarily use their PIN or restart their computers to
regain access to their accounts.
In this section, we ﬁrst report the SUS scores for YubiKey in
this study. The remainder of the section reports on observations
and comments made by participants in the exit interview.
A. SUS
Eleven participants (11; 44%) rated the YubiKey NEO and
gave it a mean SUS score of 76.4 with a standard deviation of
15.7. Fourteen participants (14; 56%) rated the YubiKey Nano
and gave it a mean SUS score of 71.9 with a standard deviation
of 9.6. In total, YubiKey received a mean SUS score of 73.9
with a standard deviation of 12.5 in this second study. Based
on comparisons to other systems and contextual descriptions
provided by Bangor et al. and Sauro et al. [25], [26], [27],
[28] (see Figure 8), this SUS score is considered “acceptable,”
and receives a B grade.
B. Trade-offs Between Security and Convenience
Five participants (5; 20%) mentioned that they had previously
been warned about unauthorized attempts to access their Google
or Facebook accounts, or had known someone whose account
had been compromised. These participants were conﬁdent that
adding 2FA to their accounts would secure them against future
attacks:
B11: “The best part was just the extra security that
it offered in addition to my password; I have had
people try to hack into [my Google] account.”
B18: “I’ve known a lot of people that have had
their accounts hacked; it is so much more hard to do
that with [the YubiKey] because you have a physical
copy of something.”
In contrast
to the YubiKey experience with Google
and Facebook, YubiKey for Windows Hello increased the
convenience of authentication but reduced its security—as long
as the participant’s YubiKey was plugged into their device,
users would not need to do anything to access their Windows
10 account. While this affects the YubiKey NEO experience,
it was much more pronounced for the YubiKey Nano, which
is intended to be left in the machine. This essentially removed
any protection against an attacker who gained physical access
to the machine. Three participants (3; 12%) noted that this was
a signiﬁcant concern:
B10: “[It was] kind of a double-edged sword: I liked
having my computer open up and just log me in, but
that meant if anyone got my computer it was much
less safe because it would just login.”
C. Desire to Continue Using the YubiKey
Fourteen participants (14; 56%) indicated that they would
like to continue using a YubiKey for 2FA. Of these, six (6;
24%) inquired about purchasing a YubiKey:
B19: “Where do you get [the YubiKeys]? . . . I loved
them, it was really cool using them.”
B12: “I actually mentioned it to my wife and said,
‘You need to get one of these, and if they’re cheap,
we should make them a Christmas present and get
them for lots of people.’ I think it is a good added
security, especially for Google, bank accounts, big
proﬁle things that you want to make sure you’ve got
a second-factor security on it.”
D. No Need to Further Protect Their Accounts
Of the ten participants (10; 40%) who indicated that they
did not want to continue using the YubiKey, six (6; 24%)
commented that they did not have any accounts that needed
the extra protections provided by 2FA. These participants felt
that either their accounts were of such low value that they
would not be the target of an attacker or that even if their
accounts were compromised, there was nothing of value to
be lost. However, all six participants did mention that they
would consider using a YubiKey in the future if they eventually
became responsible for more sensitive information.
B14: “If I am carrying some top secret or high
security stuff, I would like to have that sense of
protection. But, at this point as a student, maybe not.
They can steal my essays, whatever.”
B25: “If I had more conﬁdential things, then I would
use it. At this point I wouldn’t because of the added
steps and the little bit of added complexity to just
check an email that wasn’t conﬁdential.”
E. Sharing Accounts Between Users
One unexpected use case that was brought up by three
participants (3; 12%) was the use of account sharing, generally
with a spouse. This proved difﬁcult as only the user that
currently had possession of the device was able to access these
accounts. If the other user needed access to the account, they
would have to borrow the YubiKey or use one of the backup
2FA schemes:
B2: “Let’s say my wife needed to grab something
from my email—she would try to login from her
computer, but she couldn’t.
I know there are
workarounds, like the codes you print out at the
beginning . . . or maybe having two [YubiKeys].”
The need to share accounts also led to some surprising
interactions when needing to obtain the YubiKey from the
other party:
881

B19: “The only time I had a problem was when my
wife was driving and I needed to login to something,
and [the YubiKey] was on the keys in the ignition.
But I was able to slip it off the key ring and use it.”
F. The YubiKey Would Occasionally Insert Gibberish Text
Six participants (6; 24%) reported that when the YubiKey
was plugged into their devices, random text would occasionally
appear in the application they were using. Sometimes the
application would also perform an operation on the random
text—for example, Chrome performing a Google search for
gibberish text. This problem was caused by users accidentally
touching the YubiKey’s button while using their computer,
prompting the YubiKey to provide an authentication token. As
the YubiKey communicates to the computer using the USB
Keyboard interface, this authentication token would appear as
a random-looking string of text followed by a carriage return.
Most participants recognized that this behavior was caused
by the YubiKey, but still found it to be annoying:
B16: “I would accidentally touch [the YubiKey] and
it would enter a string of numbers and letters . . . the
ﬁrst few times I didn’t realize that it was the key.”
B1: “If you . . . just leave this plugged in and you
accidentally tap the gold button on the side, it just
spits out this string of numbers and then presses
enter. So, if you have YouTube open, it unpauses
your video; if you have Chrome open in a new tab,
then it will spit out that string of numbers and then
Google it.”
G. The YubiKey Nano Was Not Sufﬁciently Portable
Participants assigned the YubiKey Nano reported issues
related to its small size. The YubiKey Nano is designed to
be small enough to plug into a USB port and keep it there
permanently (see Figure 1). Unfortunately, this did not match
the participants’ needs, as they often needed to use the YubiKey
with multiple devices—for example, logging into their personal
email account at work—forcing them to unplug the YubiKey
Nano and carry it around with them.
Eight of 14 participants with the Nano reported that it was
not sufﬁciently portable:
B23: “It’s very small, which made it very hard to
carry around. I would carry it around in a little
container because I was unsure if I could put it on
my keys or something like that. I wish it was a little
bit bigger.”
B16: “If there was a version that was a tiny smidge
bigger, it could have a little hole into where you
could put it on your key ring.”
Three of the Nano participants were also reluctant to devote
one of their limited number of USB ports on their laptop
entirely to the YubiKey Nano:
B16: “It was a pain having it occupying space in
one of my USB ports since I don’t have many. It’s
just real estate that is wasted.”
Getting the YubiKey Nano out of the computer could also be
very difﬁcult, with one participant needing to use needle-nose
pliers to extract the YubiKey Nano.
H. Participants Were Worried About Device Loss
While three participants (3; 12%) did temporarily misplace
the YubiKey, no participant permanently lost it. Still, eight of
the participants (8; 32%) indicated that they were worried that
they would lose the YubiKey:
B15: “There was the potential that I might lose
it—there is a small little tiny hole on the end of it,
but there wasnt anything I could connect easily to my
keychain . . . I was constantly worried about losing
it.”
Backup authentication schemes conveniently ﬁll this void.
Five participants (5; 20%) told us they would like another
YubiKey for sharing or backup. Other backup schemes are
usually less secure than the primary authentication using a
security key (e.g., SMS). The result is a quandary where the
most secure backup schemes are often unavailable, and the
most available schemes are less secure. This is a problem that
requires more research.
I. Comparison to Other Forms of 2FA
Thirteen participants (13; 52%) explicitly stated that they
preferred using the YubiKey to other forms of 2FA:
B11: “I prefer having the YubiKey because I don’t
have to worry about typing in a number, I can just
press it really quick.”
B18: “The YubiKey is just easier to use. You can’t
always get to your phone, or [you] have to wait and
type to type something in.”
B8: “It was
two-factor
authentication, more convenient because when you
get a string of numbers . . . then you have to input
that and could get it wrong. [The YubiKey] was just
faster, I would prefer this over SMS.”
faster
than
SMS
Four participants (4; 16%) told us they preferred other forms
of 2FA to YubiKeys.
J. Security Keys on Mobile
All participants but one used other 2FA methods to
authenticate themselves on their phones. One participant (1;
4%) discovered that the YubiKey NEO supported authentication
over NFC and was very positive about this experience:
B15: “I think I might get the YubiKey that comes
with NFC capabilities, because I like the potential
of using that with my phone as well. Being able to
use that to get into apps like LastPass really appeals
to me too.”
VIII. DISCUSSION
After conducting both studies and analyzing the results,
several issues stood out. This section discusses these issues
in greater depth and serves as the background for the
recommendations we make in the next section.

A. Usability Differences Between Setup and Day-to-Day Usage
Our work differs from prior work in that we studied the
setup and day-to-day usage phases of 2FA in separate studies.
In our results, we found that participants’ experiences for
each phase were drastically different. Our laboratory study
revealed signiﬁcant impediments with the setup process, and
participants generally viewed the usability of the YubiKey
poorly. In contrast, in the longitudinal study, the majority of
the participants were quite pleased with their experience, rating
YubiKey’s usability very highly.
The results show that it is possible to have a system that is
highly unusable during setup, but highly usable in day-to-day
use. Research that only examined the setup phase would dismiss
security keys as wholly unusable, whereas research focusing on
the day-to-day usage phase would be overly optimistic about
security keys’ usability. Only by examining both phases is it
possible to get a holistic view.
Additionally, while it is possible to study both phases in
a single study, we caution against doing so. It would be
difﬁcult to design a study that ensures the setup experience does
