I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that my query is not a duplicate. I am currently facing an issue with increasing the default 100KB limit for `bodyParser.raw()` in Next.js 5.1.0, and I have not been able to find the correct approach.

I attempted to add the following line to `index.js`, but it did not have the desired effect:
```javascript
expressApp.use(bodyParser.raw({ limit: '5mb' }));
```

Additionally, I modified the `raw.js` vendor file to verify if the increased limit would work, but this also did not resolve the issue.

In summary, how can I properly modify the `bodyParser.raw()` limit in Next.js 5.1.0? 

Here is the error message I encountered:
```plaintext

Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
