I need to bump up the default 100KB bodyParser raw.js limit but I can't seem
to figure out the right way in Next.js 5.1.0  
I tried adding it to index.js but with no effect:  
`expressApp.use(bodyParser.raw({ limit: '5mb' }));`
I also modified the raw.js vendor file to make sure it would work if the value
was increased.
Long story short, how would I go about modifying the raw body-parser limit?
