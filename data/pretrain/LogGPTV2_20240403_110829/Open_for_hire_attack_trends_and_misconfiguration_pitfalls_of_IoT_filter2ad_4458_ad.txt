Table 7: Total attack events by type and protocol on honey-
pots (* unique source IPs)
for downloading the malware and messages with the malicious
payload. We also observed data poisoning attacks on the honeypots.
For example, there were CoAP requests that changed the data by
publishing messages. The malware are identified by analysis of
the pcap files stored on the honeypots for unusual content. Upon
finding any unusual content, for example a file or script in the
payload, we check the file with VirusTotal. Regarding poisoning
attacks, we observe if the data has been modified or deleted from
the services simulated by the honeypots. For example, we check
for any modifications attempted on the data in the MQTT queues.
We further discuss some interesting cases in Section 5. The hon-
eypots further encountered non-recurring scanning traffic from
unknown sources and suspicious requests that were not identical to
any known attack types. Such type of suspicious traffic is grouped
under the unknown scanners or suspicious requests.
4.3.2 Network-Telescope: The UCSD CAIDA network telescope
consists of 16 million IP addresses. Upon parsing the FlowTuple
dataset captured from the telescope, we observe an average of 78

Malicious traffic. Since honeypots have no production value,
all traffic that is not coming from a known scanning service is con-
sidered malicious. These interactions include brute-force attempts,
dictionary attacks, malware droppers. Besides, the traffic that does
not match the scanning attributes of known scanning tools is mali-
cious. The malware classification is based on the received payloads.
The requests are examined for port scans from recognized scanning
tools like ZMap. Furthermore, we classify the source as malicious
upon receiving recurring requests with malicious payloads. Figure
4 shows the malicious requests received per honeypot and type.
We also observe reflection attack attempts on the CoAP and UPnP
protocols. The malware attacks listed in Table 7 were classified
based on the requested content. The requests included URLs used

billion requests per day. An average of 2.7 billion is targeted to-
wards the Telnet, MQTT, AMQP, CoAP, XMPP, and UPnP protocols.
Table 8 shows the average number of suspicious requests received
on each protocol daily and the number of IPs that belonged to
scanning-services and unknown scanners. We observe that the
Telnet protocol dominates the number of suspicious traffic in com-
parison to the other protocols. This could be because of the presence
of many systems infected with malware like Mirai that constantly
scan for vulnerable systems on the Internet. For deeper analysis
into the attack sources, we check the source IPs to known scanning
services and classify them into known and suspicious sources. Table
8 lists the number of known scanning-services and the unknown
suspicious scans.

Suspicious traffic classification. We validate our findings
on classification of attack sources i.e. scanning services and mali-
cious with [30], and Virustotal [94] databases. Greynoise offers a
classification of the attack sources observed on its honeypots into
benign, malicious and unknown. The unique source IP addresses of
the traffic received on the honeypots and the telescope are searched
and corroborated with the classification from Greynoise database.
Figure 5 shows the comparison between the total number of at-
tack sources classified as scanning service by our classification and
Greynoise. We find that a majority of the sources were identified
to be from scanning services by both our method and Greynoise,
however, there were 2, 023 IP addresses that were not identified by
Greynoise. We also observe that the number of scanning services
detected by our method is higher for the AMQP, Telnet and MQTT
protocols, which is because we received traffic from multiple cyber-
security risk rating platforms. We suspect that these scans were
limited to the European continent or were country-specific.
Figure 5: Classification of scanning-services
The source IP addresses are further examined with the VirusTotal
threat database. We perform a search of the IP addresses from
unknown suspicious requests received on the honeypots and the
telescope. Upon performing a search for an IP address, VirusTotal
203
provides a positive score attribute that indicates the number of
security vendors that have flagged them as malicious. Note that we
consider the IP to be a malicious actor if there is at least one security
vendor to label them as malicious (VirusTotal has other labels like
phishing). The results are summarized in Figure 6 that lists the
percentage of IPs indicated as malicious by protocol as classified
by Virustotal. The protocols from the honeypot are indicated by
(H) and the telescope as (T). The details about specific malware
detected in the traffic are elaborated in Section 5. We observe that
the attack sources of the SMB from the honeypots have the highest
classification of malicious actors. This is because many well known
malware propagate via SMB and hence the detected numbers are
higher.

5 DISCUSSION
This section summarizes the attack trends observed from analyzing
the attacks on honeypots and the suspicious traffic from the network
telescope. We then discuss the impact of listing vulnerable honeypot
hosts by scanning services like Shodan. Finally, we investigate the
attacks observed from infected hosts and the multistage attacks on
honeypots.
5.1 Attack trends by protocol
In the following, we provide an overview of the attack trends on
the protocols simulated by the honeypots. In addition to the logs,
the network traffic is captured with tcpdump on the hosts where
the honeypots are deployed and the pcap files are further analyzed
to determine the attack vectors. Moreover, we discuss the findings
from the analysis of the pcap files from the honeypots by protocol.
5.1.1 Telnet and SSH Attacks. The Telnet protocol (simulated
by HosTaGe, Conpot, and Cowrie honeypots) received the highest
number of attacks, with a total of 47, 073 attacks, of which 12, 709
were the result of known scanning services. The remaining suspi-
cious traffic received can be further categorized into scans from
unknown scanning actors and malware. We examine the pcap files
with the Virustotal database for signs of malware signatures and
discover 113 Mirai variants. The hashes of the malware identified
IMC ’21, November 2–4, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
Srinivasa et al.
are listed in Appendix Table 13. Upon tracing the sources of the
malware, we discovered that one of the sources had a valid domain
registration as a website for a restaurant in the UK. Beyond Mirai
variants, we identified BrickerBot.2, BrickerBot.1, Hehbot and Luabot
malware that brute-force into a target with default credentials. The
Appendix Table 12 lists the default most used credentials that were
recorded for Telnet and SSH. Moreover, we observe a large number
of brute-force attacks with default passwords targeting routers and
modems.
The SSH protocol was simulated by HosTaGe, Conpot, and
Cowrie honeypots. We observe a high number of brute-force and
dictionary attacks on all honeypots. The honeypots received many
recent crypto-mining malware like LemonDuck and FritzFrog, among
other prominent malware variants. The hash of the malware sam-
ples is listed in Appendix Table 13.
5.1.2 MQTT, AMQP and XMPP Attacks. The MQTT protocol
was simulated by the HosTaGe and Dionaea honeypots. The at-
tacks mainly aimed at accessing and changing data in the topics.
A majority of the attacks tried to access the ’$SYS’ topics. Some
attacks tried to poison the data in the topics available while others
subscribed to receive messages from specific topics.
The AMQP protocol, simulated by HosTaGe, received similar
attacks to that of the MQTT protocol. The adversaries aimed at
poisoning the data in the queue through publishing data and sub-
scribing to receive new messages. We also observed a large number
of messages published by the adversaries, causing a flood leading
to a Denial Of Service.
The XMPP protocol, simulated by the ThingPot honeypot, re-
ceived brute-force attacks where the adversaries tried to log in
to the Philips Hue Bridge system. In addition, we detected some
dictionary attacks on the protocol. Lastly, we recorded attempts
from malware trying to log in as anonymous users to change the
configured state of the lights on the device. We speculate that the
malware was trying to examine their write privileges.
5.1.3 CoAP and UPnP attacks. The primary attacks on the CoAP
protocol, simulated by HosTaGe, involved discovery requests. How-
ever, after the reconnaissance, we observed returning threat actors,
especially after being listed on scanning engines like Shodan and
Binary Edge (see also Section 5.2). The number of attacks increased,
followed by poisoning attacks. Moreover, we detected flooding
attacks from unknown malicious actors which resulted in a DoS
attack against the honeypot. We observed that the flooding attacks
originated from two different sources at the same time. A reverse
lookup of the IP addresses showed the existence of duplicate DNS
entries for both the IP addresses, which leads to the possibility of
reflection or amplification attacks. The webpages of the IPs pointed
to an Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page. Other sources of the DoS
attacks appeared to originate from Italy, Taiwan, and Brazil.
The U-Pot honeypot received a large number of discovery re-
quests. Following the discovery, there were many DoS attempts
recorded on the honeypot. Similar to the attacks on the CoAP proto-
col, the adversaries performed UDP flood attacks on the honeypot.
More than 80% of the total attacks received were a part of the DoS
attacks. Two of the adversaries were first observed scanning for the
Figure 7: Attack trends by type (%) and protocol
protocol three days before the attack with the same source IP ad-
dresses. The source was traced to have a valid domain registration
and addressed to a construction service provider in Taiwan.
5.1.4 Modbus and S7 attacks. The Modbus and the S7 protocol,
simulated by Conpot, received a large number of poisoning attacks
where adversaries tried to access and change the values stored in
the registers. The attacks targeted three of the nineteen available
function codes for reading device identification, the holding register,
and the reporting server. Only 10% of the Modbus traffic used valid
function codes to access the register data. Furthermore, we observed
DoS attacks from attackers that possibly targeted the ICSA-16-299-
01 vulnerability for the Siemens S7 protocol [36]. The DoS was
performed by flooding the requests with PDU type 1, that results
in spawning of a job request in the device.
5.1.5
FTP and SMB attacks. The FTP protocol, simulated by
Dionaea, received brute-force and dictionary attacks. In addition,
a few attacks deployed malware upon successful authentication
to the FTP server. We examined the binary files deployed on the
FTP server with Virustotal and found positive results for malware.
We discovered multiple deployments of the Mozi and the Lokibot
malware. The hash of the malware from Virustotal is listed in
Appendix Table 13.
The SMB protocol, simulated by HosTaGe and Dionaea, was
largely targeted with the EternalBlue, EternalRomance, and the
EternalChampion exploits that attack Microsoft’s implementation
of the SMB protocol. Among the malware deployed, we find the
WannaCry and its variants the most common on the honeypots. The
hash of the malware identified via Virustotal is listed on Appendix
Table 13.
5.1.6 HTTP attacks. HTTP was simulated by HosTaGe, Conpot,
and Dionaea. The honeypots responded with static content and
a login page for the simulated device profiles. The protocol was
targeted with a large number of web-scraping requests, brute-force,
and dictionary attacks. In addition, we observed DoS attacks with
HTTP flood packets causing the honeypots to crash. The majority
of the DoS attacks came from China, Russia, Israel, USA, and Italy.
The attackers also tried to exploit the HTTP protocol by injecting
crypto-mining malware. Upon performing a reverse lookup of the
204
Attack trends and misconfiguration pitfalls of IoT devices
IMC ’21, November 2–4, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
we search how many of the identified misconfigured devices (see
Table 5) are present as attack sources against our honeypots and
the telescope. We identify a total of 11, 1182 unique IP addresses
that originate from misconfigured IoT devices. Furthermore, all of
the aforesaid IP addresses were flagged as malicious by at least one
scanning vendor in Virustotal.
We extend the detection of infected IoT devices by searching
the remaining source IP addresses in the Censys database [15]. The
Censys database has a labelled dataset of IoT devices and returns
