Subject: Request for RTL Language Support in Bootstrap

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to request the inclusion of Right-to-Left (RTL) language support as a default feature in Bootstrap. This enhancement will significantly improve the usability and accessibility of Bootstrap for users who work with RTL languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
