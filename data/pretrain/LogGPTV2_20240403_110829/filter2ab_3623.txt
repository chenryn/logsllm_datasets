### Title: My Cloud is APT's Cloud: Investigating and Defending Office 365

As organizations increasingly adopt cloud services, attackers are following them into the cloud. Microsoft Office 365 has become the most widely used email platform in enterprises worldwide, making it an attractive target for threat actors. Office 365 includes not only Exchange but also Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, and other applications. The vast amount of data stored in Office 365 means that, in many cases, attackers can achieve their objectives without compromising the on-premises network.

In this presentation, we will explore several case studies based on real Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) intrusions that we have investigated. We will start with relatively unsophisticated techniques commonly used by less experienced attackers, which have been widely discussed. We will then progress to more advanced and stealthy techniques that we have observed only a few times in the wild. These sophisticated techniques often exploit lesser-known and poorly monitored features of Office 365.

Throughout the session, we will provide insights into the various forensic artifacts available to investigators and highlight the nuances and complexities involved in analyzing these artifacts. We will also discuss common pitfalls that can ensnare inexperienced analysts. Finally, we will share best practices for administrators to protect their Office 365 environments against these increasingly sophisticated threats.
