User: What commands can be used to monitor system performance and resource utilization in the Linux system? Please provide detailed instructions for use.
Assistant: 1. top The top command can monitor system resource utilization in real time, including CPU, memory, and processes. It can sort processes by CPU utilization or memory utilization. Use the top command to get more information by pressing some keys, for example: 'u' can filter processes by user name or uid, 'p' can filter specific processes by process ID, etc. 2. vmstat vmstat is a command-line tool used in Linux to display the status of virtual memory, system CPU, memory and disk I/O utilization. vmstat can also track process I/O statistics and system memory usage. For example, vmstat 1 can refresh the current status every second. 3. sar The sar (system activity report) command can collect and display performance data during system operation. You can use the sar command to monitor CPU, memory, disk, I/O, etc. It can record data and periodically store it in a data file for subsequent analysis. For example, sar -u 1 10 can record CPU usage and other related data 1 time every 1 second, and record the result 10 times. 4. iostat iostat is a very useful command, which is often used in Linux. It can display the utilization rate of disk, CPU and various IO. You can use the iostat command to monitor information such as disk I/O usage, network data transmission, and CPU load. For example, iostat -x 1 10 can output detailed disk IO information every second, a total of 10 times. 5. free The free command can display available and used system memory and swap partition information, including total memory, available memory, used memory, cache, and so on. For example, free -m can display memory usage in MB. The above commands are commonly used tools for monitoring system performance and resource utilization in Linux systems, and can be used to help administrators monitor the real-time performance status of the system.
