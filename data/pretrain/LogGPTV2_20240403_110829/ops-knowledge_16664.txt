User: I would like to build an application in Google App Engine (Python) that would be fully connected to a single GMail account and then filter e-mails from this account (e.g. filter messages for a certain string and show it on the string). In the future I am also going to implement the option to send messages.
What is the most efficient way to do this (solution provided by Google if possible)?
Assistant: What do you mean by "fully connected"?
It's possible to set up a GMail filter to forward emails to a different address (say, the email address of your App Engine app). And an App Engine app an send emails (say, to a GMail address). The trick is to set up the GMail filter carefully to avoid loops.
