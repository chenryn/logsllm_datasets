I just configured rust and I noticed this warning appear:
    sed: 1: "tools/Makefile": undefined label 'ools/Makefile'
Nothing seems to have gone wrong as a result of this, but I think this might
indicate a subtle problem with some sed invocation somewhere.
I'm using the default sed that ships with OS X Lion (BSD sed, not sure which
version)
