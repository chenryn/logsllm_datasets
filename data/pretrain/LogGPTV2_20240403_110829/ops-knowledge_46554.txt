User:  How to set the IP address, subnet mask and gateway of the network interface on the Linux system?
Assistant: On Linux systems, you can use the ifconfig command and the route command to set the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway of a network interface. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Open the terminal and log in to the system as user root. 2. Use the ifconfig command to view the network interfaces in the current system to determine the name of the network interface that needs to be configured. For example, you can use the following command to list the names of all network interfaces in the system: ``` ifconfig -a ``` 3. Use the ifconfig command to set the IP address, subnet mask, and broadcast address of the network interface to be configured. For example, a network interface named eth0 can be set to have an IP address of 192.168.1.100, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and a broadcast address of 192.168.1.255 using the following command: ``` ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255 ``` 4. Use the route command to set the default gateway. For example, you can use the following command to set the default gateway to 192.168.1.1: ``` route add default gw 192.168.1.1 ``` 5. Use the ifconfig command to check again whether the set IP address, subnet mask, and broadcast address are valid. For example, you can use the following command to view the detailed information of the network interface named eth0: ``` ifconfig eth0 ``` 6. Use the route command to check whether the default gateway is set successfully. For example, you can use the following command to view the current routing table: ``` route -n ``` Note: The above commands need to be adjusted according to the actual network environment, such as the actual values of IP address, subnet mask, and gateway.
