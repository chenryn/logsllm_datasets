With introduction of next-plugins we've got more functionality and
dependencies exposed in `next.config.js`, using plugins like `next-sass` and
others adds extra development dependencies to the runtime, even in production
mode, since `next.config.js` is execute at server start time.  
Requiring us to carry along node modules that we'd never use with production
baked artifacts.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
As we discussed last week, possible solution would be to allow next.js to read
lifecycle specific configs, like `next.config.dev.js` and
`next.config.build.js` with fallback to `next.config.js`.
## Current Behavior
Loads `next.config.js` irrespectively of the lifecycle stage.
Thank you.
