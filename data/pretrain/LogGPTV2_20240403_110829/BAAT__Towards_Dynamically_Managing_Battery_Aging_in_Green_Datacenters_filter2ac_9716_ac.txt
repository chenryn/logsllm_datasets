types of architecture: per-rack integration and per-server integration 
Each group of batteries has a power table which records the 
battery utilization history logs as shown in Table 2. These log 
data are collected from corresponding sensor of each battery and 
are  sent  to  BAAT  controller.  The  BAAT  controller  then 
calculates  various  metrics  (NAT,  CF,  PC,  DDT,  and  DR)  for 
evaluating the aging process. The BAAT controller also has the 
knowledge  of  the  power  information  of  each  server  through 
datacenter IT infrastructure such as IPDU or other power meters. 
It can control the power state of each server (e.g., DVFS, clock 
throttling, and VM migration and consolidation) by a software 
driver within each server.  
With the architecture and monitored logs, BAAT controller 
can dynamically and intelligently manage various battery aging 
issues. We propose three management schemes integrated with 
the  BAAT  controller:  (1)  load  scheduling  policy  for  hiding 
aging, (2) power capping strategy for slowing down aging, and 
(3) algorithm for planning the aging  speed. Among those, the 
aging-hiding  scheduling  is  a  battery  aging-aware  workload 
placement  and  consolidation  policy,  which  can  be  added  to 
existing  datacenter  workload  management  schemes  for  better 
addressing  battery  aging  issues  across  datacenters.  The  aging 
slowing  down  strategy  can  effectively  mitigate  battery  aging 
rate  and  avoid  server  availability  degradation.  The  planned 
aging is used when datacenter lifetime and battery aging rate are 
discrepant and require synchronization.

B.  Hiding Aging: Aging-Driven Scheduling 
1)  Technique Background 
In a distributed energy storage system, different commodity 
battery  nodes  can  experience  significant  aging  variation.  The 
reasons of aging variation are: (1) current battery manufactures 
techniques cause the deviations of actual aging time from their 
nominal  specification,  and  (2)  different  power  demand  and 
supply  of  each  server  lead  to  varied  charging/discharging 
behaviors on each battery node.  
If datacenter operators neglect the aging variation issue, they 
have  to  replace  batteries  that  undergo  faster  aging  irregularly, 
which  unavoidably 
increases  battery  maintenance  and

replacement  cost.  Moreover, 
that  some  critical 
workloads are running on  a “ prone-to-wear-out” battery node 
but its unusual fast aging rate is ignored, the server availability 
is severely threatened as a battery node that ages faster can more 
easily cause unexpected server downtime. Therefore, it is wise 
to carefully balance battery aging variation issue. 
We  propose  to  hide  the  effects  of  battery  aging  across  the 
datacenter.  In  detail,  we  schedule  the  workloads  on  different 
server  nodes  (associated  with  different  battery  units)  in  an 
aging-driven  manner.  We  want  the  scheduling  to  be  such  that 
the  aging  slowest  battery  node  can  age  faster,  while  the  fast-
aging battery node ages slower. As a result, the aging process of 
some of the worst battery units is hidden. 
2)  Implementation Details 
The  battery  aging-aware  scheduling  is  performed  when 
datacenter  operators  deploy  new  applications  or  perform 
workload  consolidation.  To  effectively  accomplish 
the 
scheduling, we consider the load power, energy demand, and the 
battery aging conditions in a coordinated manner. 
a)  Load Power Demand Profiling 
Providing  detailed  and  accurate  workload  power  profiling 
information  can  help  us  place  the  workloads  to  the  most 
appropriate  battery  nodes  while  considering  the  aging  issue. 
Many  datacenter  applications  can  provide  coarse  granularity 
power  profile,  such  as  long  time  running  services  (web 
searching,  memcached, 
periodic/repetitive 
workloads (e.g., web crawling) [33]. In our study, using power 
profiling contributes to better estimation of its impact on battery 
aging as well as aging handling. 
and/or 
etc.) 
b)  Battery Aging Consideration 
As  mentioned  in  the  last  section,  BAAT  is  able  to  assess 
battery aging process via five metrics (NAT, CF, PC, DDT, and 
DR) and we can calculate each aging quantization value based 
on  the  BAAT  runtime  logs.  BAAT  mainly  relies  on  Ah-
throughput (NAT), charge factor (CF) and partial cycling (PC) 
to determine workload allocation for hiding the aging effect. For 
example,  a  very  high  value  of  Ah-throughput  indicates  faster 
aging, since normally there is a fixed number of electric charge 
that  can  be  cycled  from  a  battery  before  it  needs  replacement 
[31, 32]. Meanwhile, a low CF value implies that the battery has 
more discharging events than charging (to their full capacity). A 
lower  PC  indicates  that  a  battery  mostly  stays  at  a  very  high 
depth of discharge (DoD). 
Based  on  the  implications  of  these  three  metrics,  we  can 
the  given 
to  allocate  battery/server 
decide  how 
for 
workloads/applications. Intuitively, we should place more loads 
on the aging slowest battery node, but the challenge is how to 
find  the  most  suitable  battery  node  base  on  different  aging 
mechanisms.  Our  solution  is  to  combine  the  power  demand 
profiling and the weighted value of the three metrics.

To find the optimal battery node to place new workloads, we 
roughly classify the power & energy profile of green datacenters 
into four scenarios as shown in Table 3. The power demand is 
treated as “Large” if the load power consumption exceeds 50% 
of the peak power. Otherwise, we define the power demand as 
“Small”.    Similarly,  we  classify  the  energy  demand  as  either 
“More” or “Less”. They implies the load running length and the 
total energy request.  
Different  metrics  have  different  sensitivities  to  the  power 
and  energy  demand.  For  example,  “Large”  power  demand 
reduces the value of CF and PC, whereas the AT is more likely 
to decrease when the energy request becomes “Less”.  
a CF b
PC c NAT
We  use  “High”,  “Low”  and  “Medium”  to  respectively 
denote  the  impact  of  load  power/energy  demand  on  the  three 
metrics  as  shown  in  Table  3.  We  set  weighting  factors  for 
different metrics and calculate a weighted aging value as: 
Weighted aging
(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:25)(cid:12)(cid:3)
(cid:3)
In Eq-6, a, b and c are all weighting factors. The value of 
these factors are set as 50% in the “High” scenario, 30% in the 
“Middle” scenario and 20% in the “Low” scenario respectively. 
Our  extensive  training  and  experiments  shows  that  these 
weighting  factors  are  fairly  effective  when  evaluating  battery 
aging.  A  large  value  of  the  weighted  aging  indicates  the  fast 
aging  pace.  We  can  rank  the  weighted  aging  value  of  all  the 
battery  nodes  in  datacenters  for  the  load  placement,  which  is 
triggered  when  adding  new  jobs  or  performing  workload 
consolidation, as shown in Figure 8.  
In  summary,  the  battery  aging-driven  workload  scheduling 
can  effectively  balance  the  battery  aging  processes  across  the 
datacenters.  As  the  inaccurate  power  profiling  may  lead  to 
wrong  load  placement  or  consolidation  sometimes,  we  can 
further leverage aging slowing down technique to remedy it.

1)  Technique Background 
It is dangerous to discharge battery with high discharge rate 
during  low  SoC  state.  Doing  so  not  only  accelerates  battery 
aging but also puts the server at the risk of low availability. Due 
to  the  intermittency  of  renewable  energy  supply  and  the 
imbalanced  workload  power  demand  of  each  server,  some 
battery nodes may always stay at low SoC but experience high 
discharging rate. To further improve the overall battery lifetime, 
we need to slow down battery aging at appropriate timestamp. 
2)  Implementation Details 
Our  algorithm  periodically  checks  two  metrics:  deep 
discharge time (DDT) and high discharge rate (DR). If a battery

In  Eq-7,  DoDgoal  is  the  battery  DoD  for  the  planned  aging 
rate.  Ctotal is  the  nominal  value  of  battery  total  Ah-throughput 
specified  by  the  manufacturer,  Cused is  the  past  Ah-throughput 
that  has  been  discharged,  Cycleplan is  the  planned  cycle  which 
can be estimated base on the battery usage log in datacenter. 
The  planned  aging  technique  can  be  built  on  the  slowdown 
aging technique. We implement planned aging by replacing the 
low SoC value in slowdown aging technique with (1- DoDgoal). 
Also,  the  planned  aging  does  not  exclude  hiding  aging.  The 
hiding  aging  technique  still  places  and  consolidates  workload 
across datacenter to balance all the battery node aging based on 
the  planed  aging  rate.  The  planned  aging  technique  can 
effectively  help  us  synchronize  the  battery  aging  rate  with  the 
end-of-life of datacenter infrastructures.   
V.  EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY 
A.  System Prototype 
We have built a heavily instrumented energy storage system. 
It  enables  us  to  analyze  various  battery  aging  issues  and 
evaluate  the  proposed  techniques.  We  synergistically  integrate 
our energy storage system with a scaled-down green datacenter 
prototype  also  built  from  scratch.  As  shown  in  Figure  11,  our 
prototype system consists of a pack of batteries, sensors, servers, 
and  power  meters.  Specifically,  we  classify  these  hardware 
components into six modules based on their functionality.  
1)  Battery  Module.  Our  system  employs  emerging 
distributed energy storage architecture. Each server is equipped 
with individual battery unit. We use multiple new sealed lead-
acid batteries with the same capacity and voltage rating in our 
experiment.  The  same  initial  condition  of  the  batteries  allows 
us  to  conduct  comparable  experiments  with  different  aging 
management policies.   
2)  Sensor  Module.  The  sensor  device  module  includes 
several front-end sensor devices, which are used to measure the 
voltage,  current  and  temperature  of  each  battery.  A  data 
acquisition card [35] plugged-in server motherboard via PCI-e 
interface  is  used  to  collect  the  data  from  sensors  to  computer 
hard  disk.  Based  on  the  two  devices,  the  sensor  data  can  be 
viewed by LabVIEW [38] in real time. 
3)  Control Module. Our control server is a customized i7 
low  power  server,  which  runs  our  BAAT  algorithms.  The 
control server can collect the sensor data and calculate different 
metrics to access the aging process, monitor computing server 
power consumption information via IPDU [37]. Various aging 
management policies can be integrated into the control server 
to monitor and control both computing servers and batteries. 
4)  Power  Module.  The  power  switch  module  mainly 
contains  power  switch  and  power  conversion  equipment  such 
as  IPDU,  PLC,  relays,  battery  charger  and  DC-AC  inverters.

maximal current that can sustain discharge for 2 minites (Tthreshold) 
always exhibits low SoC, it indicates the server loads allocated 
to the battery node are too heavy. In this case, if there is a peak 
power  demand  from  the  server  and  the  primary  power  source 
(intermittent  renewable  power  or  utility  power)  lacks  enough 
power budget, battery voltage may reduce to the cut-out line and 
lead to server downtime. Therefore, we set thresholds for DDT 
and DR to avoid unplanned battery cut out.  
When  the  SoC  of  battery  drops  below  40%,  BAAT 
periodically checks DDT and DR to see if they reach a preset 
thresholds.  It  leverages  virtual  machine  (VM)  migration  or 
performance  scaling  (DVFS)  to  avoid  battery  cut-off.  It  first 
checks the workload running on the battery node to see whether 
VM migration can be performed. If so, BAAT selects a target
