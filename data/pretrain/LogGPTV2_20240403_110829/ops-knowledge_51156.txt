User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题When should police be notified about host intrusion? If an attacker gains unauthorized access to a host, or makes unauthorized modifications to information on that host, is it appropriate to contact the police or some other law-enforcement agency?  In many cases, the host in question is in the United States, and the attack appears to originate outside the United States.

Assistant: I can only provide one Dutch case: A webdesign and hosting company (with approximately 100 clients) had a password hacked that was used for everything. (Yeah, don't get me started on all other security issues there.) A few websites were defaced, and private information from the owner was made public. Overall relatively little damage, but damage with a clear origin (we had the attacker's IP which was not a proxy and traced back to the same city).

We printed out the logfiles that we were able to get together (logging was malfunctioning on most websites...), and my boss went to the police with the information. At the police station, nobody knew anything about computers, but everything was written down best they could. The people usually taking these cases were having a training and would probably pick it up next week.

Next week came and passed. Next month came and passed. We called for updates, nothing. The case would have been a simple lookup (ISPs are required to log which IP is owned by whom at any given time), but they didn't do anything.

To the best of my knowledge, it's now 6 months later and the case hasn't even been looked at yet. I still think you should always go to the police with a breach, but the odds of it being solved are low when there is no big money involved.
