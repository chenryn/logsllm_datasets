Hello,  
I'm here forwarding the bug filed in the Debian BTS at
http://bugs.debian.org/564774 .
The bug refers to 1.3.0 but I'm able to replicate it with 1.4.1 too. The key
part is (for the rest, please read the link above):
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.savez('test.npz', N.ones((10000, 1000)))
    >>> ll -h *.npz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 michael michael 77M 2010-01-11 15:52 test.npz
    >>> !gzip test.npz
    >>> ll -h test*.gz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 michael michael 114K 2010-01-11 15:52 test.npz.gz
                                 ^^^^
Thanks for your support,  
Sandro
