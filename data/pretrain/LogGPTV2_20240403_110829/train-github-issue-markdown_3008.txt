Hello,

I am forwarding a bug report originally filed in the Debian Bug Tracking System (BTS) at [http://bugs.debian.org/564774](http://bugs.debian.org/564774). The issue is present in both NumPy versions 1.3.0 and 1.4.1.

The core of the problem can be demonstrated with the following code:

```python
import numpy as np
np.savez('test.npz', np.ones((10000, 1000)))
```

After running this code, the file `test.npz` is created with a size of approximately 77 MB:

```bash
$ ls -lh *.npz
-rw-r--r-- 1 michael michael 77M 2010-01-11 15:52 test.npz
```

However, when this file is compressed using `gzip`, the resulting file size is only about 114 KB:

```bash
$ gzip test.npz
$ ls -lh test*.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 michael michael 114K 2010-01-11 15:52 test.npz.gz
```

This significant reduction in file size suggests that the `np.savez` function may not be efficiently compressing the data.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,  
Sandro
