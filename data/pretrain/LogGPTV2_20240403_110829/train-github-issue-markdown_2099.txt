I am using a Three.js file that has not Revision version. It says on top:

  * As I understand there are many authors of this file and they are mentioned inside the file in many places *

I load some obj. and .mtl files and I create and add some object in the scene.
I put them in an array, so I can detect when they 're clicked succesfully. (
(intersectObjects(objs,true) )
Although, when I create simple circle meshes and put them in an array so I can
detect them, detection does not fully work. Very difficultly
intersectObjects() detects my clicks on the circles (needs 4-5 clicks on
average).
The strange thing is that when I press F12 and I open the Developer Tools (and
then I close it or not,does not matter), everything works perfectly and the
circles are easily detected. Very strange. I think something is wrong with
intersectObjects(). It seems to me that it does not handle well the meshes.
Piece of code (because project is big and complicated):

Note: I think couple of days ago console put out an "error" message relate to
the .getDescendants function of the Three.js file in the IntersectObjects
function.
