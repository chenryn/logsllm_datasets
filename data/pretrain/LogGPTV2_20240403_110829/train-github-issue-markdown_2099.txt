I am working with a Three.js file that lacks a revision version. The file includes the following author information at the top:

- @author mrdoob / http://mrdoob.com/
- @author Larry Battle / http://bateru.com/news
- @author bhouston / http://exocortex.com

It is based on:
https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/bf657be243a075b5e72acc8a83e6f12a564d8f55/underscore.js#L767

The file has multiple authors, and their contributions are acknowledged in various parts of the file.

**Browser:** Chrome Version 34.0.1847.137 m

In my project, I load `.obj` and `.mtl` files and create and add objects to the scene. These objects are stored in an array, which allows me to detect when they are clicked using `intersectObjects(objs, true)`.

However, when I create simple circle meshes and add them to the same array for click detection, the detection does not work reliably. On average, it requires 4-5 clicks to successfully detect the circles.

Interestingly, if I open the Developer Tools (by pressing F12) and then close it, the detection works perfectly, and the circles are easily detected. This behavior suggests that there might be an issue with the `intersectObjects()` function, as it seems to handle the meshes poorly.

Here is a piece of the code, as the entire project is quite large and complex:

**Note:** A few days ago, the console displayed an error message related to the `.getDescendants` function in the `IntersectObjects` function of the Three.js file.
