User: In order to indicate activity, some applications (e.g. Pidgin) highlight their entry in GNOME's Window List panel widget (e.g. via bold font or flashing color). This indication is reset automatically when the window is activated.
I have a terminal application for which I would like to achieve the same thing (preferably via Perl, but Python would work too) - but I have no idea where to start. I imagine I'd first have to find the terminal window (based on window title) and then trigger some kind of GTK action.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Assistant: I'm not really into GTK programming, but as far as i know you want to set an "URGENT"-Flag for the Window which should be highlighted. Maybe this will get you any further. :)
