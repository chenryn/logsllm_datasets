To indicate activity, some applications (e.g., Pidgin) highlight their entry in GNOME's Window List panel widget, typically through bold text or a flashing color. This indication is automatically reset when the window is activated.

I have a terminal application for which I would like to achieve a similar effect, preferably using Perl, though Python would also be acceptable. However, I am unsure where to start. I imagine the process would involve first identifying the terminal window based on its title and then triggering a GTK action to highlight it.

Any assistance or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

While I'm not an expert in GTK programming, I believe you may need to set an "URGENT" flag for the window that you want to highlight. This flag can be used to draw attention to the window. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of the steps you might take:

1. **Identify the Terminal Window:**
   - Use the window title to find the specific terminal window.
   - In Perl, you could use the `X11::Protocol` module to interact with the X Window System.
   - In Python, you could use the `pygetwindow` or `gi` (GTK introspection) libraries to find the window.

2. **Set the URGENT Flag:**
   - Once you have identified the window, you can set the URGENT flag to make it flash or otherwise stand out.
   - In GTK, this can be done by setting the `_NET_WM_STATE` property to include `NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION`.

Here is a basic example in Python using the `gi` library to set the URGENT flag:

```python
import gi
gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')
from gi.repository import Gtk, Gdk

def set_urgent_flag(window_title):
    # Get the default screen
    screen = Gdk.Screen.get_default()
    # Get the list of all windows
    window_list = screen.get_window_stack()
    
    for window in window_list:
        if window.get_name() == window_title:
            # Set the URGENT flag
            window.set_accept_focus(True)
            window.set_urgency_hint(True)
            break

# Example usage
set_urgent_flag("Your Terminal Title")
```

For Perl, you might use the `X11::Protocol` and `X11::Protocol::Other` modules, but the implementation would be more complex and less straightforward than in Python.
