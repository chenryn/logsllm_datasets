I'm currently using IDLE, and while it is decent, I am interested in exploring other lightweight Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) specifically designed for Mac. I am open to both free and commercial options.

One recommendation is Fraise, which is a free and lightweight text editor that offers several useful features, such as automatic indentation, syntax highlighting, code completion, and an integrated shell. It is simple and effective for many coding tasks.

Are there any other IDEs you would recommend for Mac users?
