### What happened
SFTPSensor is continuously running even when the files matching file pattern
passed by the user are available in sftp location. This is happening because
the variable `actual_file_to_check` holds just file name where as the method
`get_mod_time` expects file name with path.

### What you think should happen instead
SFTPSensor should stop execution as soon as it finds first file match.
### How to reproduce
Trigger SFTPSensor with file pattern as shown in the below code snippet.  
`checkForSFTPFiles = SFTPSensor( task_id="checkForSFTPFiles",
path=f"{SFTP_ROOT_DIR}", file_pattern='Migrate*', poke_interval=10 )`
