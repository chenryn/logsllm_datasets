Assistant: This log chunk shows the QuorumCnxManager software component attempting to establish connections with other nodes. It begins with the SendWorker and RecvWorker threads being interrupted, followed by four connection requests being received. The SendWorker thread is then interrupted again, and the RecvWorker thread is interrupted twice. Finally, the SendWorker thread is interrupted again and leaves the thread.
