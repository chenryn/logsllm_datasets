Given this:
    struct S;
    impl Drop for S {
        fn drop(&mut self) {
            println!("Dropping S");
            panic!("DIE");
        }
    }
    struct T;
    impl Drop for T {
        fn drop(&mut self) {
            println!("Dropping T");
        }
    }
    fn main() {
        let t = T;
        let s = S;
    }
The output is:
    Dropping S
    thread '' panicked at 'DIE', nounwind.rs:6
The `drop()` call for T is completely skipped, while I would have expected it
to be called.
