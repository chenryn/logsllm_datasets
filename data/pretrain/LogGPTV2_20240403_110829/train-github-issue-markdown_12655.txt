In the Carousel documentation, there is the following Usage example:
## Usage
### Multiple carousels
Carousels require the use of an **id** on the outermost container,
**.carousel** , for carousel controls to function properly. When adding

relevant controls.

#### Proposed Fix
The places where it says **id** should be replaced with **class** or the
**.carousel** should be an id selector instead.

prevent it from moving left or right.
