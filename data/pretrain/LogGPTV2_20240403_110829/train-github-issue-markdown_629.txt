I am working on an app with messaging capability. When the app has been force
closed or is running in the background the user receives a push notification.
Clicking on the notification opens the app and ideally brings them to the
thread of the message they just received. However, currently I am pushing
three separate pages onto the stack and therefore one of the pages is shown
for a split second before loading the thread. It would be ideal to be able to
**push a tree of pages** onto the stack so that only the last page loads and
is shown to the user rather than briefly showing all three.
