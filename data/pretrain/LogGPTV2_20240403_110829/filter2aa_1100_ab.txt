Your Issues
•
In your career you will produce copyrights and patents
What rights will you retain and for how long?
How will people use your IP?
•
Is there a public need for IP “greenspace”?
Patents are 17 years
Copyright = lifetime + 75 years

The Future of Freedom
"I worry about my child and the Internet all the 
time, even though she's too young to have logged 
on yet. 
“Here's what I worry about. I worry that 10 or 15 
years from now, she will come to me and say 
'Daddy, where were you when they took freedom 
of the press away from the Internet?'"
--Mike Godwin, Electronic Frontier Foundation

Peer-to-Peer Filesharing 
Security
• In the wake of Napster and other RIAA targeted 
file-sharing operations, systems like Freenet and 
Gnutella claim end-user anonymity.  How real is 
that claim?
• Aren’t there millions of P2P users?  
How can my activity be tracked down?
• Assuming “reasonable care” is taken to protect 
my computer, how safe is P2P from a security 
point of view?

About Freenet
• What is Freenet?
• Who is behind Freenet?
• If authors are anonymous how can you trust 
information?
• Do I have to donate disk space and bandwidth?
– I don't have to donate anything when using filesharing 
application X and I get to leech more
– All my friends donate very little space and bandwidth. Why 
should I donate more? 
– If I donate a lot will my experience improve significantly?
– What do I get from running a permanent node?

About Freenet
• Is Freenet legal?
– Can I get trouble if I run a node?
• What about copyright?
• What about child porn, offensive content or 
terrorism?
• How about encryption export restrictions?
• I have nothing to hide and don't need anonymity. 
Is there anything else Freenet can offer?

Freenet Security
• Won't attack X break Freenet's anonymity?
• Is Freenet vulnerable to flooding attacks?
• Why hash keys and encrypt data when a node 
operator could identify them (the data) anyway if 
he tried?
• What about hostile "cancer" nodes within the 
network?
• What about specific attack “Y?”

Guidelines for Peer-to-Peer 
Developers
A few general guidelines for P2P developers can be 
derived from an analysis of contributory and 
vicarious copyright infringement principles
Copyright 2003 - SunStorm Security Group
Slide Number 49 of 64
Guidelines for Peer-to-Peer 
Developers
•
Your two options: total control or total anarchy. 
•
Better to sell stand-alone software products 
than on-going services. 
•
Can you plausibly deny knowing what your 
end-users are up to? 
•
What are your substantial non-infringing uses? 
•
Disaggregate functions. 
Copyright 2003 - SunStorm Security Group
Slide Number 50 of 64
Guidelines for Peer-to-Peer 
Developers
•
Don't make your money from the infringing 
activities of your users. 
•
Be open source. 
•
Do not be a direct infringer: make and store no 
copies. 
•
Do not build any "circumvention devices" into 
your product. 
•
Don't use someone else's trademark in your 
name.

Strategies in Developing
Peer-to-Peer Apps and 
Services
Auto-Update
Does the use of "auto-update" functionality in 
peer-to-peer filesharing software increase 
the likelihood of copyright liability for the 
software vendor?

Slide Number 52 of 64
Strategies in Developing
Peer-to-Peer Apps and 
Services
Developer Liability
Can the individual developers involved in a 
peer-to-peer filesharing product be held 
personally liable for the copyright 
infringement of end users?

Slide Number 53 of 64
Potential Defenses
• No Direct Infringer
"All Users are Innocent Fair Users"
• The Sony Betamax Defense
"Capable of substantial noninfringing uses“
• The DMCA Section 512 “Safe Harbors“
• Because basic architecture decisions may 
influence a system's eligibility for these defenses, 
a P2P developer would be wise to consider the 
limits of each defense in evaluating the legal 
risks posed by any particular system design.
