## Abstract
This paper focuses on the Internet infrastructure, specifically the technologies and organizations that provide Internet service, rather than the architectural design principles. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in rethinking the structure of the Internet's infrastructure. Currently, both transit between domains and last-mile delivery are handled by a set of ISPs interconnected through BGP. We propose separating these two tasks. For transit, we suggest creating a "public option" for the Internet’s core backbone. This public option would (i) run an open market for backbone bandwidth, leveraging links offered by third parties, and (ii) enforce network neutrality to encourage competition and reduce the advantage of large incumbents.

## Introduction

### 1.1 Context
The current structure of the Internet infrastructure is largely an accident of history rather than a premeditated design. Initially, the Internet was a monolithic structure with a uniform routing protocol across all nodes. As it evolved into separate Autonomous Systems (ASes) and became commercialized in the 1990s, it settled into a pattern of interconnections. Each stub domain connected to the Internet through one or more Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Interconnections between ISPs were primarily bilateral and fell into two categories: customer-provider or peering. The interdomain routing protocol BGP was developed to give ASes control over which paths to import and export. Since only the largest ISPs had substantial backbones, the concept of transit emerged, where some ISPs carried packets not originating from or destined for their own domains.

In the early days of the Internet, wide-area bandwidth was extremely expensive, making backbones a sign of prestige and dominance. This led to a small number of Tier 1 providers acting as the glue for the Internet. However, over the past five years, long-haul bandwidth has become cheaper and more easily leasable. According to [53], median monthly lease prices for 10Gbps and 100Gbps links have declined by 27% and 24%, respectively, across critical city-pairs. While long-haul bandwidth is still more expensive than local bandwidth, it no longer dominates ISP costs [27].

The availability of leasable wide-area bandwidth has enabled companies like Cato [7] and Aryaka [2] to create application-specific backbones. Content providers accounted for 85% of international demand in the trans-Atlantic market in 2018 [53]. Large cloud and application providers, such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, have built their own global high-bandwidth backbones to interconnect data centers and reach colocation facilities. With backbone bandwidth readily available, a significant portion of Internet traffic no longer relies on transit provided by the public Internet (see Section 2.4).

As core bandwidth becomes more plentiful, ISPs are focusing on improving and expanding last-mile connectivity. The network edge now dominates ISP capital expenditures and is where innovation and expansion are most apparent. Given these changes, it is a good time to reconsider how we might re-architect the Internet's infrastructure.

### 1.2 Proposal
Our proposal is based on three key principles. First, while transit is becoming privatized, the public Internet must continue to offer high-performance transit to enable new content and service providers without requiring them to lease or construct their own backbones. Second, transit and last-mile delivery should be separated. Third, revenues should align with the value delivered and costs incurred to avoid tussles such as the network neutrality debate.

We propose the creation of a global Public Option for the Core (POC). The POC would be run by an international nonprofit organization, initially leasing bandwidth from Bandwidth Providers (BPs) and charging users to recoup costs. The nonprofit nature ensures a focus on providing global transit, avoiding lucrative markets or underserved areas. The POC could eventually acquire its own links.

For last-mile service, a new generation of ISPs, called Last-Mile-Providers (LMPs), would use the POC for transit, eliminating the need to build their own cores or use transit from competing ISPs. Content and Service Providers (CSPs) could either connect directly to the POC (for large CSPs) or use LMPs to reach the POC.

In our proposed design, packets would originate in an LMP or CSP, be carried by the POC to the destination LMP (see Figure 1). The POC acts as a large IXP, leaving peering decisions to attached LMPs. We propose enforcing network neutrality through contractual obligations, rewarding entities that bring value to consumers and enabling new entrants without unfair competition from incumbents.

The POC and LMPs would operate in parallel with the current Internet infrastructure, interconnecting with traditional ISPs. The full benefits will be realized when the POC becomes a large-scale provider. Multiple coexisting POCs, run by different entities but adhering to the same principles, could allow for innovation while providing the same benefits.

### 1.3 Contributions
This paper is not a traditional SIGCOMM paper, which typically describes a concrete design, defines performance objectives, and presents a thorough evaluation. Instead, we delve into why this proposal is necessary and describe how it can be implemented. We analyze the economic implications of requiring network neutrality and conclude with a discussion on the feasibility of the proposal.
