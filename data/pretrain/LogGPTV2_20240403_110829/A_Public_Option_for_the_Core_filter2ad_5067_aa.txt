Abstract
This paper is focused not on the Internet architecture – as defined
by layering, the narrow waist of IP, and other core design principles
– but on the Internet infrastructure, as embodied in the technologies
and organizations that provide Internet service. In this paper we
discuss both the challenges and the opportunities that make this an
auspicious time to revisit how we might best structure the Internet’s
infrastructure. Currently, the tasks of transit-between-domains and
last-mile-delivery are jointly handled by a set of ISPs who intercon-
nect through BGP. In this paper we propose cleanly separating these
two tasks. For transit, we propose the creation of a “public option”
for the Internet’s core backbone. This public option core, which
complements rather than replaces the backbones used by large-scale
ISPs, would (i) run an open market for backbone bandwidth so it
could leverage links offered by third-parties, and (ii) structure its
terms-of-service to enforce network neutrality so as to encourage
competition and reduce the advantage of large incumbents.

Introduction

1.1 Context
The structure of the current Internet infrastructure – as opposed
to its architecture – is largely an accident of history, rather than a
premeditated design. In fact, the Internet was originally a monolithic
structure, with a uniform routing protocol operating across all nodes.
As the Internet devolved into separate Autonomous Systems (each
with many internal nodes) and became commercial in the 90s, it
settled into a pattern of interconnections that, while complicated in
its details, was conceptually simple. Each stub domain connected to
the Internet through one or more Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
Interconnections between ISPs were largely bilateral and typically
fell into one of two categories – customer-provider or peering – and
the interdomain routing protocol BGP was invented to give domains
control over which paths to import and export. Because only the
largest ISPs had substantial backbones, the notion of transit became
necessary, where some ISPs carried packets that were neither from
or to hosts in their domain. As a result, the path of a typical packet
would start at the originating domain, continue through one or more
transit domains, and then arrive at the destination domain.
In these early days of the Internet, wide-area bandwidth was ex-
tremely expensive, so the backbones or cores (we will use the terms
interchangeably) – which allowed large ISPs to provide transit to
other providers – were a sign of prestige and a source of dominance.
This resulted in a small number of Tier 1 providers acting as the glue
for the Internet as a whole. The primacy of these Tier 1 providers,
and their key role in making wide-area transit possible, allowed the
Internet to flourish.
However, over the past five years, long-haul bandwidth has be-
come cheaper and easily leasable: median monthly lease prices
across a selection of critical city-pairs declined an average of 27%
and 24% (for 10Gbps and 100Gbps links, respectively), according
to [53]. Of course, long-haul bandwidth is still far more expensive
than bandwidth inside an enterprise campus or datacenter, but our
point (which we elaborate on below) is that it no longer dominates
the costs of ISPs [27].
The availability of leasable wide-area bandwidth has allowed
companies such as Cato [7] and Aryaka [2] to create their own
application-specific backbones. In fact, in the trans-Atlantic market,
content providers accounted for 85% of the international demand in
2018 [53]. Several large cloud and application providers – such as
SIGCOMM ’20, August 10–14, 2020, Virtual Event, NY, USA
Y. Harchol, et al
Google, Amazon, and Facebook – have gone further and built their
own global high-bandwidth backbones to interconnect their data-
centers and to reach various colocation facilities (such as Equinix).
Since backbone bandwidth is now readily available for lease or pur-
chase, and the expertise needed to run backbone networks has spread
beyond the global ISPs, a large fraction of Internet traffic no longer
relies on transit provided by the public Internet (see Section 2.4).
With core bandwidth becoming more plentiful, the attention of
ISPs is turning to improving and expanding last-mile connectivity.
The network edge now dominates the capital expenditures of ISPs
(e.g., see [27] for a discussion of the difference between core and
access costs) and is also where innovation and expansion are most
readily apparent.
After such sizable changes in the underlying costs and ISP priori-
ties, now is a good time to rethink how we might want to re-architect
the Internet’s infrastructure. This first requires us to examine several
problems with our current Internet infrastructure, which include out-
dated peering policies, threats to network neutrality, persistent lack
of competition (in the US market), and increasing vertical integra-
tion. Then, motivated by these problems, we propose a restructuring
of the Internet infrastructure that helps address them. Because the
problems require a rather lengthy discussion, we first give a brief
preview of our proposal.
1.2 Proposal
There are three key principles in our proposal. First, while transit
is rapidly being privatized, it is essential that the public Internet
continues to offer high-performance transit so that new content and
service providers can emerge without having to lease or construct
their own backbone. Second, the way to save public transit is to
cleanly separate it from last-mile delivery. These two functions –
transit and last-mile-delivery – are currently combined in global
ISPs, but this paper describes the advantages of splitting them. Third,
revenues should be more closely aligned with the value delivered and
cost incurred; without such alignment, the Internet will continue to
suffer from tussles [10] such as the network neutrality debate. What
we are searching for is no less than the economic architecture of the
Internet whose longevity can match that of its technical architecture.
For transit, we propose the creation of a global Public Option
for the Core (POC).1 The POC would be run by an international
nonprofit organization that initially leases bandwidth from a set of
Bandwidth Providers (BPs) and charges the users of its infrastructure
to recoup these costs. That is, while the POC is a nonprofit, it is not a
charity, so we expect it to break even financially. The nonprofit nature
is necessary to ensure that it focuses on its mission of providing
global transit, rather than moving into more lucrative markets (such
as last-mile-delivery or content and services) or avoiding poorly
served areas. The initial use of leased links allows the POC to start
without massive capital expenditures, but the POC might eventually
acquire some links of its own.
For servicing the last mile, a new generation of ISPs we call Last-
Mile-Providers (LMPs) use the POC for their transit, so they need
not build a core of their own nor use transit provided by a competing
ISP. These LMPs could be existing access-oriented ISPs or newly
1The term “Public Option” was previously used by Ma and Misra [39] to describe a
quite different approach to improving network neutrality. We describe the technical
differences between our proposal and theirs in Section 2.6.
Figure 1: Network connectivity in our proposal. The Public Option for the
Core (POC) which we describe in this paper acts as the main transit provider,
but it connects to one or more ISPs to provide connectivity to anything not
accessible through the POC. Customers – which include content and service
providers (CSPs), users, and enterprises – connect to last mile providers
(LMPs), which in turn connect to the POC. Some large CSPs also connect to
the POC directly.
created access providers; what is new is that they rely on the POC
for transit. In addition, content and service providers (CSPs) could
either directly attach to the POC (which would be the case for large
CSPs), or make use of an LMP to reach the POC.
Within our proposed design, packets would originate in one LMP
(or in a CSP), be carried by the POC directly to the destination
LMP (see Figure 1). As such, the POC is functioning as a large IXP;
the POC itself exercises no peering policies and merely acts as a
transparent fabric, leaving it to the attached LMPs to decide whether
and how to exchange traffic. This LMP-to-LMP peering decision
raises the question of whether and how to enforce network neutrality,
which is a topic we focus on later in the paper.
In terms of economics, in our proposal there is a clear delin-
eation of who pays for what. As part of this delineation, we propose
enforcing network neutrality (in a form we define later) through
contractual obligations rather than regional legislation. This arrange-
ment rewards those entities that bring value to consumers, while
enabling new entities to enter the market without unfair competition
from incumbents who, without the requirement of network neutrality,
could easily extract revenue from the value being provided by others.
This POC and the LMPs attached to it are intended to operate in
parallel with, and connected to, the current Internet infrastructure.
Nothing in this proposal forces current ISPs to change their oper-
ations, and we expect the POC to interconnect with one or more
traditional ISPs (and eventually become a Tier 1 provider itself). Our
proposal is intended to open a parallel track through which transit
can be provided (by the POC), and last-mile service established
(through LMPs). However, the full benefits of this approach will
come only when the POC becomes a large-scale provider.
We should note that there could be several coexisting (and inter-
connected) POCs, run by different entities but adopting the same
basic principles (nonprofit, focusing on transit, enforcing network
neutrality). This would allow innovation in network management
practices while providing the same basic benefits. However, for ease
of exposition, we will focus on the case where there is a single POC.
In the next section we delve into why we recommend this proposal,
and then in Section 3 describe how this can be implemented. In
Section 4 we analyze the economic implications of requiring network
neutrality, and conclude in Section 5 with a frank discussion of the
question most readers are asking themselves after reaching this point:
Are they crazy?
