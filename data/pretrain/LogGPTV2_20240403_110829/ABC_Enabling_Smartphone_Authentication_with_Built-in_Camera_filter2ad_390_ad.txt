versa. Fig. 11 shows the performance of the detection result
as a ROC curve. Both true positive rate and false positive rate
increase with the reducing of the threshold. To minimize the
total error rate of forgery detection, we choose 75.7 as iPhone
set’s forgery detection threshold and 162.9 as Samsung set’s
threshold. For iPhone 6, the chosen threshold yields a false
positive rate of 0% and a false negative rate of 1.01%. For
Galaxy Note 5, the false positive rate is 0.14% and the false
negative rate is 0.64%.
The reason why some forged image pairs can successfully
pass the forgery detection mechanism is because the K(a)
introduced during their forgery process is too weak. Because
of the existence of random noise, the strength of K(a) ran-
domly varies between exposures even when the intensity of
ambient light is ﬁxed. If an adversary accidentally captures
an image with a weak K(a) during the authentication process,
she may able to fabricate a forged image that can pass the
forgery detection mechanism. However, as shown in Fig.2, the
detection result will also be affected by the strength of K(c). As

Image sets: The applied image sets include 6,000 images
captured by 30 individual iPhone 6 devices and 10,000 images
captured by 10 individual Samsung Galaxy Note 5 devices.
The resolution of iPhone 6 images and Samsung Galaxy Note
5 images are 2448 × 3264 and 2048 × 1152, respectively.
These images are collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk and
our own devices. To ensure the randomness of the collected
images, the image collection tasks we published on Mechanical
Turk had no limitation on image content or the way people take
photographs.
Metrics: We use the following metrics to evaluate the
ﬁngerprint of a smartphone camera. Peak to Correlation En-
ergy (PCE) measures the correlation between a query image’s
noise residue and the reference ﬁngerprint. It can be used to
indicate the quality of the reference ﬁngerprint and the strength
of the ﬁngerprint carried by the query image. Cumulative
distribution function (CDF) is a graphical plot that illustrates
the distribution of a value X. Given a speciﬁc value α, the
CDF shows the probability that the X will take a value less
than or equal to α. In this paper, CDF is used to compare the
PCE distributions of different experimental settings. A setting
with higher PCE value will achieve better accuracy in both
ﬁngerprint detection and forgery detection.
B. Smartphone Camera’s PRNU
Before presenting the detailed setting of our experiments,
we ﬁrst summarize the investigated questions and our key
observations as follows:
1
Does PRNU change over time? No. We have tested
images captured in three different years. There is
no signiﬁcant difference in the ﬁngerprints on those
images.
2 Will the ambient environment affect the ﬁngerprint
on an image? Yes, we have tested the impact of
light, temperature and relative humidity. The only
factor that can affect the ﬁngerprint is the intensity
of ambient light. The strength of the ﬁngerprint on
a captured image signiﬁcantly increases with the rise
of the light intensity.
3 What is the relationship between an image’s resolu-
tion and the strength of its ﬁngerprint? Positively
correlated. When cropping an image to different
resolutions, the strength of its ﬁngerprint is nearly
proportional to the number of remaining pixels.
How does the number of reference images affect
the strength of the extracted reference ﬁngerprint?
For each smartphone, the strength of the extracted
reference ﬁngerprint
to the
number of reference images.
is nearly proportional

1) Impact of Age: In an authentication system, a usable
hardware ﬁngerprint should not change over time. Since the
average life cycle for a smartphone is around 22 months [3],
we evaluate a smartphone’s PRNU with images captured in
three different years: 2015, 2016 and 2017. All tested images
were captured in the same room with ﬁxed light intensity. The
smartphone applied in this test is an iPhone 6.
To ﬁnd out if PRNU changes over time, we ﬁrst extract a
reference ﬁngerprint from an image captured in 2017. Then, we
conduct ﬁngerprint matching with three image sets collected in
10
Fig. 12. Probe signal detection. Setting 1: The presented QR code does not
contain the probe signal. Setting 2: The presented QR code contains a probe
signal and ﬁngerprint removal is not performed on the captured image. Setting
3: The presented QR code contains a probe signal and ﬁngerprint removal is
performed on the captured image.
Although this loss also affects the probe signal, the information
loss caused by ﬁngerprint removal is much more severe. To
compare channel distortion and ﬁngerprint removal, we test
the probe signal with three different settings: 1) The presented
QR code does not contain the probe signal. 2) The presented
QR code contains a 800× 800 probe signal, and the adversary
does not conduct ﬁngerprint removal on the captured image.
3) The presented QR code contains a 800 × 800 probe signal
and ﬁngerprint removal is performed on the captured image.
In the experiment, we ﬁrst put the smartphone (iPhone 6) in
parallel to the veriﬁer’s interface (iPad mini 2) and photograph
the presented QR code I(s). We then perform region detection
and subsampling on the captured image I(c) to extract the
challenging QR code and get I(cid:48)
(c). Finally, we calculate the
PCE value between I(s) and I(cid:48)
(c). For each setting, we repeat
the experiment 20 times and show the CDF of the PCE value in
Fig. 12. It can be observed that: 1) the probe signal is preserved
in the captured images. The PCE value of the second setting
is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the ﬁrst setting; 2) using
the probe signal, we can reliably detect ﬁngerprint removal.
The PCE distributions of the second and third setting have no
overlapping. We note that the PCE value of the ﬁrst setting is
mainly caused by the image content shared between I(s) and
I(cid:48)
(c).
Being sensitive to all ﬁngerprint removal methods and ro-
bust against camera screen channel distortion, the probe signal
applied in ABC can effectively detect ﬁngerprint removal.
VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we ﬁrst investigate the characteristics of a
smartphone camera’s PRNU. We then evaluate the efﬁciency of
the proposed ABC protocol. Finally, a user study is conducted
to demonstrate the usability of the system.
A. Experiment Setup
Conﬁguration: The evaluation is conducted using Matlab
on a Windows system with 8 Core Intel i7-4720HQ processor
running at 2.6 GHz. The algorithm for ﬁngerprint matching
and extraction is based on the code by digital data embedding
laboratory [27].

Impact of ambient environment. The CDF of each setting plots a distribution of the correlation between two images captured in that environment.
The only environmental factor that affects camera ﬁngerprint is the intensity of ambient light. The strength of the ﬁngerprint on a image signiﬁcantly increases
with the rise of the ambient light intensity.
ambient light. 2) Compared with an indoor image, an outdoor
image normally carries a stronger ﬁngerprint. Therefore, one
possible way to improve the identiﬁcation accuracy is to extract
the reference ﬁngerprint from an outdoor image.
3) Impact of Ambient Temperature and Relative Humidity:
To understand how ambient environment affect the ﬁnger-
print on a captured image, we further investigate the impact
of ambient
temperature and relative humidity. In order to
eliminate the impact of ambient light, all tested images are
captured in an indoor environment with ﬁxed light intensity.
For ambient temperature, we have tested 17.78°F, 45.5°F and
85.1°F. For relative humidity, the tested images cover 27%,
45% and 78%( a rainy day). Similar to the last experiment, we
construct 200 image pairs for each conﬁguration and conduct
ﬁngerprint matching. As shown in Fig. 13(c) and Fig. 13(d),
there is no signiﬁcant difference between the CDF of different
conﬁgurations. Therefore, PRNU is not affected by ambient
temperature or relative humidity.
4) Impact of Image Resolution: Since the resolution of
the image token signiﬁcantly affects the overhead of the
authentication process (Section VI-C) in terms of the time used
for authentication, we now evaluate the ﬁngerprint detection
strategy on resizing images.
The images captured by a digital camera can be resized
with down-sampling or image cropping. For down-sampling,
we tested three most commonly used interpolation methods:
nearest-neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic. For image cropping,
we crop a rectangular area from the target image. After resizing
an image, we also need to decide the image format to be
used to store it. We test the two most commonly used image
formats: 1) PNG, which supports lossless image compression.
The obtained image has accurate pixel values but requires
more storage space. 2) JPG, which supports lossy compression.
The obtained image is noisy but smaller. The scaling ratio is
deﬁned as the proportional ratio of the size of the resized image
to the size of the original image. We tested different image
scaling ratios from 40%-80%. Overall we have 24 different
conﬁgurations, each of which is tested with 100 matching
image pairs and 100 non-matching image pairs generated from
the Samsung image set.
Fig. 15 shows the CDF of the obtained similarity value.
We make the following observations. Image resizing method:
image cropping is much better than all tested down-sampling
methods and it has the most distinguishing similarity value in
Fig. 14.
The impact of age. We use a reference image captured in 2017
and conduct ﬁngerprint matching with images captured in different years. The
CDF of each year shows the distribution of the PCEs obtained for that year.
different years. Each image set contains 200 images captured
by the tested device. Fig. 14 shows the CDF of the obtained
PCE value. As the reference ﬁngerprint is captured in 2017,
the CDF of 2017 shows the correlation between noise residues
(ﬁngerprints) from the same year, and the CDF of 2015
and 2016 show the correlation between noise residues from
different years. Since there is no signiﬁcant difference between
these three CDFs, the PRNU of the tested smartphone did not
change over the last three years.
2) Impact of Ambient Light: The quality of an extracted
ﬁngerprint is mainly determined by the noise components of
the image of interest. Since the ambient light will affect the
random noise component on a captured image, it is important
to investigate the impact of ambient light on camera ﬁnger-
print. We evaluate images captured in six different environ-
ments: 1) Indoor low: a windowless room with a dim ﬁlament
lamp. 2) Indoor median: a windowless room with several
ﬂuorescent lamps. 3) Indoor high: a indoor environment with
several windows. The ambient
light source is the sun. 4)
Outdoor morning. 5) Outdoor noon. 6) Outdoor evening. The
outdoor images are captured on a sunny day.
During the experiment, we construct 300 image pairs for
each conﬁguration and conduct ﬁngerprint matching on those
image pairs. The PCE value calculated for each image pair in-
dicates the strength of the ﬁngerprints carried on them. Fig. 13
shows the CDF of the obtained PCE values. The observations
are as follows: 1) The strength of the ﬁngerprint on a captured
image signiﬁcantly increases with the rise of the intensity of

Impact of image resolution. For each setting, we conduct ﬁngerprint
matching with matching and non-matching image pairs. When the resized
image is stored in JPG format, the scaling ratio has no signiﬁcant impact on
the obtained PCE values. When PNG is used, the PCE value obtained from a
matching image pair is nearly proportional to the number of remaining pixels.
all conﬁgurations. We note that image cropping is also the
most efﬁcient one. Image format: PNG is better than JPG
in ﬁngerprint detection. For the matching image pairs, PNG
images generate higher PCE values than JPG images. For non-
matching image pairs, JPG images generate higher PCE values
than PNG images due to the noise components introduced
during the lossy compression process. Scaling ratio: a higher
scaling ratio results in a higher PCE value for PNG images.
The scaling ratio has no remarkable impact on JPG images.
To summarize, the best resizing strategy is to crop the
image to the target resolution and save the obtained image
in the PNG format. Comparing the distributions of matching
and non-matching image pairs, it can be observed that even
images with 40% scaling ratio (16% pixel amount) can achieve
a decent accuracy.
5) Impact of the Number of Reference Images: For images
with a low scaling ratio, one approach to improve the accuracy
of ﬁngerprint detection is to increase the number of reference
images uploaded by the user. Since this approach also increases

Impact of number of reference images. For every scaling ratio and
image format, the PCE value obtained from a matching image pair is nearly
proportional to the number of reference images.
the registration overhead of the authentication system, we
further investigate how the number of reference images affects
the similarity value of resized images.
Since the high registration overhead can severely degrade
user experience, we only tested 1, 2, 4 and 6 reference images.
The images are resized with image cropping and saved in both
PNG and JPG formats. The image scaling ratios are 40%,
60% and 80%. Each of the 24 conﬁgurations is tested with
100 matching image pairs and 100 non-matching image pairs
generated from the Samsung image set. Fig. 16 shows the
CDF of the obtained similarity values. We observe that: 1) for
the JPG format, although increasing the number of reference
images can improve the accuracy of ﬁngerprint detection, it is
hardly possible for JPG images to achieve fair accuracy with
reasonable registration overhead; 2) for the PNG format, even
images with a scaling ratio of 40% can achieve high accuracy
with a very low registration overhead.
C. Time Overhead
We ﬁrst analyze the cost of each individual procedure
involved in the authentication process and then discuss the

the most common resolutions shown in Table II.
Image Content Matching: the cost of this procedure is
mainly determined by the version of the applied QR code.
Based on the experimental results in [40], smartphones can
decode QR codes of a very high version (20) within 0.1 second.
