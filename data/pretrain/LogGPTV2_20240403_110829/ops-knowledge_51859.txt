User: I hear that the permissions level via crontab and terminal is totally different.
More specifically, my python script has a command to write a file into the /tmp/ directory. On a linux machine, everything works, both cron and regular shell.
However on OSX, the terminal runs fine but when this command is set on the crontab, an error appears saying that we don't have permissions to write to  the /tmp directory.
How should I handle this?
Thanks.

as Hyperboreus said it depends on the user privilege who run it . i think that if you give the /tmp/ dir a 777 permission from the root account it'll be fixed :
chmod 777 -R /tmp/
okay try with : chmod 777 /tmp/ if the error still check if the directory /tmp/ exist !
