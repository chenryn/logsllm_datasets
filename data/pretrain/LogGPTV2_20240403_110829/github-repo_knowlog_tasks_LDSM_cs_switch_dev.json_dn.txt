以下是经过优化后的文本，使其更加清晰、连贯和专业：

1. **ESWITCH-5-NOMOREVLANS:**
   - 原文: `ESWITCH%d Only %d Bridge-GroupsvLANS are supported, A configuration error occurred.`
   - 优化后: `ESWITCH%d only supports %d Bridge-Group VLANs. A configuration error has occurred.`

2. **BPE-3-MALLOC_FAILURE:**
   - 原文: `BPE-3-Malloc Failed [[chars]], Could not allocate memory.`
   - 优化后: `BPE-3: Memory allocation failed. The system was unable to allocate the required memory.`

3. **TELEMETRY-6-SYSLOG_UNKNOWN:**
   - 原文: `Syslog message id [dec] is not implemented, Traffic congestion has cleared in the dedicated bearer.`
   - 优化后: `Syslog message ID [dec] is not implemented. Traffic congestion in the dedicated bearer has been resolved.`

4. **C10K_WRED-2-EREVENT:**
   - 原文: `Error @ [chars]:[dec], General error to be used for sanity tests.`
   - 优化后: `Error at [chars]:[dec]. This is a general error used for sanity testing.`

5. **ENVM-6-SW_FAN_OFF:**
   - 原文: `FAN Commanded OFF inlet %d DegC, XDR_DDTS_COMPONENT "This error indicates a potential coding problem. It is an error that may occur every time this image is run and may require a code change to fix it."`
   - 优化后: `Fan commanded off due to inlet temperature of %d°C. This error suggests a potential coding issue that may persist with each run of this image and might require a code modification to resolve.`

6. **MPLS_TE_AUTO_TUN-4-REMOVE_FAIL:**
   - 原文: `Removing existing auto tunnels may have failed.%s%s MPLS_TE_AUTO_TUN_STD_CONFIRM Use \show running-config\ to confirm expected configuration. Repeat CLI configuration as needed., The LIBER PBMGR ISSU client failed to get buffer space for building a negotiation message. A negotiation message cannot be sent to the standby device. If a problem occurs with the ISSU session negotiation the standby device cannot be brought up properly.`
   - 优化后: `Failed to remove existing auto tunnels. Verify the configuration using the `show running-config` command and repeat the CLI configuration if necessary. The LIBER PBMGR ISSU client could not obtain buffer space to build a negotiation message, preventing it from being sent to the standby device. This can result in the standby device not being properly initialized during ISSU session negotiation.`

7. **SNASW-3-DS_LOG_21:**
   - 原文: `PROBLEM - %lu - Served end node attempted to delete a home directory entry [chars] A served end node attempted to delete a directory entry that is defined as a home entry at this node. This normally occurs when snasw location has been used to define LUs owned by served end or LEN nodes. The Delete request is rejected with the specified sense code., snasw "Use no snasw location to remove the home entry from the directory." Cause type - SNA`
   - 优化后: `Problem %lu: A served end node attempted to delete a home directory entry [chars]. This typically happens when the `snasw location` command is used to define LUs owned by served end or LEN nodes. The delete request was rejected with the specified sense code. To remove the home entry, use the `no snasw location` command. Cause type: SNA.`

8. **DIAG_PORT_LB-3-TEST_RES_SEND_FAIL:**
   - 原文: `Failed to send [chars] test results back to Diagnostics Infrastucture. Error:[chars]., The port loopback test was not able to send the test results.`
   - 优化后: `Failed to send [chars] test results to the diagnostics infrastructure. Error: [chars]. The port loopback test was unable to transmit the test results.`

9. **IIFRP-3-MSGMAPINITFAILED:**
   - 原文: `IIF Mapping database init failed Creating the local mapping database failed. this is fatal as nothing else could be done in the system, nova-iosd.`
   - 优化后: `IIF Mapping database initialization failed. The creation of the local mapping database failed, which is a critical error as it prevents further system operations. (nova-iosd)`

10. **PIM-4-HELLO_INT:**
    - 原文: `Configured PIM hello interval [dec]ms on interface [chars] is less than the supported minimum value of [dec]ms, using the minimum value, PIM minimum hello interval.`
    - 优化后: `The configured PIM hello interval of [dec]ms on interface [chars] is below the supported minimum value of [dec]ms. The system will use the minimum value. PIM minimum hello interval.`
