### Revolting Radios: A DEF CON 26 Project

**Introduction**
Revolting Radios is a playful pun, but it also represents a serious exploration of how technology can be repurposed to subvert control and surveillance. This project was inspired by the dystopian themes in George Orwell's "1984," where technology is used as a means of pervasive surveillance and control. Our goal is to demonstrate that with creativity and ingenuity, we can turn these tools against their intended purpose.

**Project Background**
At DEF CON 26, the theme was centered around the oppressive use of technology, reminiscent of Orwell’s dystopia. The idea was to "over-commit" to this theme, as suggested by Mike Ossmann and Dominic Spill. We aimed to show that even in a highly controlled environment, there are ways to reclaim privacy and autonomy.

**Breadboard SDR: Building a Radio Receiver**
**Scenario:**
We discovered that we could reprogram one of Big Brother’s telescreens and stream samples from the auxiliary Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) in its microcontroller. The question was: Can we build a radio receiver using this microcontroller?

**Solution:**
When you build a radio in software, you don’t need much hardware. By leveraging the ADC, we were able to create a functional radio receiver. This demonstrates that even in a controlled environment, it is possible to repurpose existing technology for communication.

**Clock Signal Transmitters: Exfiltrating Data from Air-Gapped Networks**
**Scenario:**
We needed to exfiltrate data from one of Big Brother’s air-gapped networks. We had an ally inside but no radio transmitter. Could our ally reprogram a microcontroller to transmit data over the air?

**Solution:**
- **Miek’s OOK Transmitter**: [Demo](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/cloudyinfamouscapybara)
- **Ang Cui’s Funtenna**: [Paper](http://www.funtenna.org/CuiBH2015.pdf)
- **Raspberry Pi FM Transmitter**: [GitHub](https://github.com/PNPtutorials/FM_Transmitter_RPi3)
- **GreatFET One PLL Transmitter**

Our demonstration target used a frequency deviation of ±25 kHz and a center frequency of 315.005 MHz. We transmitted with a frequency deviation of ±50 kHz at a center frequency of 315.050 MHz, and it worked. If it oscillates like a radio and emits like a radio, it is a radio.

**GPIO Pin Receiver: Implementing a Receiver Without an ADC**
**Scenario:**
Big Brother updated telescreens to a new version without an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and restricted the distribution of ADCs to prevent improvised radio receivers. Can we use a General-Purpose I/O (GPIO) pin on a microcontroller to implement a receiver without an ADC?

**Solution:**
We explored the possibility of using a GPIO pin to implement a simple 1-bit receiver. This approach leverages the basic capabilities of a microcontroller to detect and process signals, demonstrating that even minimal hardware can be repurposed for communication.

**Direction Finder to PSK Transmitter: Countermeasures Against Pseudo-Doppler Direction Finders**
**Scenario:**
Big Brother deployed pseudo-Doppler direction finders to track down illegal radio transmitters. Can we steal a direction finder and use it as a countermeasure?

**Solution:**
- **Pseudo-Doppler Direction Finding**: [Shmoocon 2018 Talk](https://archive.org/details/Shmoocon2018/Shmoocon2018-Pseudo-dopplerRedux.mp4)
- **Opera Cake Antenna Switch**: Using an antenna switching board, we rapidly change antennas to introduce phase shifts.
- **Phase Shifting**: Switching from one antenna to another that is closer or farther from the other end of the link, or switching from one cable to another that is longer or shorter, introduces a phase shift.
- **Adding Phase Shifts to Circumvent Pseudo-Doppler**: By introducing phase shifts, we can make it difficult for pseudo-Doppler direction finders to accurately locate the transmitter.

**Implementing a PSK Transmitter with a Direction Finder**
Since we can affect the phase, can we use a direction finder to implement a Phase Shift-Keying (PSK) transmitter? We used the Opera Cake with delay lines to add phase shifts, and an external modulator to add a covert channel.
