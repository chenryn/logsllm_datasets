A little background
“One of the things that makes Orwell's '1984' scary is the way it uses technology. 
In Orwell’s dystopia, tech is a one-sided means of control. The powers that be 
use machines for pervasive surveillance, to weaken your sense of self and to 
make real change feel impossible. Humans deprived of any private space are 
uniquely vulnerable, and Big Brother knows it.”
                                                                                  - DEF CON 26 theme
“Let’s over-commit to that theme.”

Breadboard SDR
Scenario
We’ve found that we can reprogram one of Big Brother’s telescreens and stream 
samples from the auxiliary Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) in its 
microcontroller.
Can we build a radio receiver out of this microcontroller?
Breadboard SDR
When you build a radio 
in software, you don’t 
need much hardware
Clock Signal Transmitters
Scenario
We need to exfiltrate data from one of Big Brother’s air-gapped networks.
We have an ally but no radio transmitter inside.
Can our ally reprogram a microcontroller on the inside to transmit data over the 
air?

GreatFET One PLL Transmitter
Real World Radios
Our demonstration target used a frequency deviation of +/-25 kHz and a center 
frequency of 315.005 MHz.
We transmitted with a frequency deviation of +/-50 kHz at a center frequency of 
315.050 MHz, and it worked!
If it oscillates like a radio
and emits like a radio
It’s a radio
GPIO Pin Receiver
Scenario
Big Brother has updated telescreens to a new version without an Analog to 
Digital Converter (ADC) and has restricted distribution of ADCs in an effort to 
prevent improvised radio receivers.
Can we use a General-Purpose I/O (GPIO) pin on a microcontroller to implement 
a receiver without an ADC?
1 bit ought to be 
enough for anybody
Direction finder to PSK 
transmitter
Scenario
Big Brother has deployed pseudo-Doppler direction finders to track down illegal 
radio transmitters.
Can we steal a direction finder and use it as a direction finding countermeasure?

Phase shifting
Switching from one antenna to another that is closer or farther from the other 
end of the link introduces a phase shift.
Switching from one cable to another that is longer or shorter introduces a phase 
shift.
Adding phase shifts 
circumvents 
pseudo-Doppler
Scenario
Since we can affect the phase, can we use a direction finder to implement a Phase 
Shift-Keying (PSK) transmitter?
