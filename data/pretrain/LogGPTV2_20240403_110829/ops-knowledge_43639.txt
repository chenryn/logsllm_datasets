User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题phpmyadmin fail2ban failed login log I have a Debian server with phpmyadmin.  I want to use fail2ban to block brute force attack.  I have questions:


How can I log the failed login attempts to log?  Where to set that?  I can only find the log in  /var/log/apache2/access.log  even it is success or fail in login.

If that is the only log I can have, what should be the regular expression for fail2ban?
 failregex = ^ -*POST /phpmyadmin/index.php *

Assistant: Edit /etc/phpmyadmin/config.user.inc.php file and add something similar to:

&lt;?php

$cfg['AuthLog'] = '/tmp/phpmyadmin.log';


Check it out:

tail -F /tmp/phpmyadmin.log


Perform a bad login in your phpmyadmin. Expected output similar to:

Jan 19 09:20:00 phpmyadmin: user denied: sfsd (mysql-denied) from 10.163.1.128

If your phpmyadmin server is behind a reverse proxy and its private IP address is 10.163.1.128 you probably want to log the public IP address of the client, so step 1 should be:
&lt;?php

$cfg['AuthLog'] = '/tmp/phpmyadmin.log';
$cfg['TrustedProxies'] = array('10.163.1.128' =&gt; 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR');

Please bear in mind that the user running your phpmyadmin (typically www-data) should have write access to file and parent dir defined in $cfg['AuthLog'] variable name
