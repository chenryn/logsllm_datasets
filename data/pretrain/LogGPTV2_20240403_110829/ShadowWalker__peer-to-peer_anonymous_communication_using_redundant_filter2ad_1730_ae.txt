## 1. Simulation Parameters
- **Simulation l-values**: 2-4
- **Fraction of compromised nodes**:
  - 0.1
  - 0.15
  - 0.2

### Figure 14: Anonymity

## 2. Lookup Security
For varying values of \( r \):
- When \( f = 0.1 \) and \( r = 2 \), the probability of a successful lookup is 0.99.
- Even when \( f \) is increased to 0.2, the lookup remains successful with a probability of 0.95.
- The security of the lookup improves exponentially with increasing \( r \) because the likelihood that a node and all its shadows are malicious decreases exponentially with \( r \).
- For \( f = 0.2 \) and \( r = 3 \), the lookup succeeds with a probability of 0.99.
- For small values of \( r \), the lookup security can be enhanced by performing redundant versions of the lookup.

## 3. Anonymity
### 5.4 Anonymity
We present simulation results for the anonymity provided by ShadowWalker. Our simulations include a comprehensive system evaluation to check for any hidden correlations not captured by our analytical model. The simulator also accounts for real-world behavior, such as the effect of irregular topologies, which is not considered in our model. 

**Figure 14** depicts the anonymity provided by ShadowWalker for \( l = 4 \) and \( l = 2-4 \). The simulation and analytical results closely match.

## 4. Related Work
### 6. RELATED WORK
- **Danezis and Clayton [9]** studied attacks on peer discovery and route setup in anonymous peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. They showed that if an attacker learns the subset of nodes known to the initiator, the routes can be fingerprinted unless the initiator knows about a substantial fraction of the network.
- **Danezis and Syverson [13]** extended this work, observing that an attacker who learns that certain nodes are unknown to the initiator can also carry out attacks and separate traffic going through a relay node. Both these attacks assume a global passive adversary but are similar to the restricted topology attack.
- **Circuit-clogging attack [1, 31]**: McLachlan and Hopper [26] observed that in P2P systems, this attack can reveal the true initiator. They proposed a stochastic fair queuing mechanism to mitigate the attack. The circuit-clogging attack is particularly effective against a restricted route topology, as during traceback of the random walk, there are only \( d \) possibilities at each step. Our extension of using only the last two hops of an \( l \)-hop random walk for anonymous communication makes the traceback significantly harder for the adversary, requiring the measurement of \( d^{l-2} \) hosts.
- **Degradation of anonymity with time**: The predecessor attack, originally proposed by Reiter and Rubin [37], has been analyzed in detail by Wright et al. [50, 51]. Guard nodes [51] are a defense against predecessor attacks used in the current version of Tor [34]. However, the use of guard nodes in P2P systems needs more study, as a straightforward implementation would allow attackers to quickly arrive at an effective anonymity set size of \( d \).
- **Intersection attacks [2, 36]**: These attacks work by noting which nodes are active at the time a message is received. They are a particular concern for P2P systems due to the highly dynamic participation of most nodes [52]. The best approaches for combating these attacks are to reduce the perspective on the network given to the attackers [21]. Even with the best defenses, a large fraction of nodes will be able to achieve a near-global view. Our redundant topology exacerbates the problem by increasing the effective node degree. Whether a network that is resilient to intersection attacks can achieve similar levels of anonymity to our design remains an open question.
- **Variant of intersection attack**: This variant is applicable to our protocol, where instead of noting the set of active nodes, the adversary uses probabilistic information about the initiator using the restricted topology attack. This attack works much faster compared to the traditional intersection attack. Due to space constraints, we have omitted a complete analysis of this attack. Our results indicate that the de Bruijn topology effectively resists this attack.

## 5. Concluding Remarks
### 7. CONCLUDING REMARKS
We proposed ShadowWalker, a new design for low-latency P2P anonymous communication. ShadowWalker effectively defends against common attacks on P2P systems and achieves levels of anonymity superior to the state of the art in P2P anonymous communication. Specifically, when 20% of all nodes are compromised, ShadowWalker provides 4.5 bits more entropy than Salsa. Moreover, the probability of end-to-end timing analysis in this case is less than 5%, which is close to the ideal scenario in Tor, where the probability of end-to-end timing analysis is 4%.

Our system presents several trade-offs between anonymity and performance overhead. We have demonstrated points along these trade-offs that have manageable computation and communication overheads while providing strong anonymity guarantees. ShadowWalker is also able to handle moderate churn in the network, presenting a promising new direction for P2P anonymous communication.

We note that our redundant structured topology design has benefits that may extend beyond anonymity systems, which we will study in future work. We will also extend our design to incorporate issues of heterogeneous node bandwidth and exit policies.
