User: When I created my virtual environment, it inherited all of the environment variables that were currently on my Windows machine. I have since changed many of those variables, and my virtual environment is now stuck with the old values. How can I change the environment variables within my virtual environment?
Assistant: I discovered that the reason my virtual environment's environment variables were keeping their previous values was because I was still in the same terminal session. Restarting my terminal fixed the issue.
