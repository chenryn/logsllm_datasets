**ATT&CK ID:** M1026  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

**Recommendation:**
Do not permit remote access via SSH for root or other privileged accounts. 

**Explanation:**
Restricting direct remote access to privileged accounts, such as root, enhances security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse. Instead, consider using non-privileged accounts for remote login and then elevating privileges locally when necessary.
