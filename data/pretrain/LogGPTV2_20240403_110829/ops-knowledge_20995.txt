User: I have installed Cygwin Terminal in OS Windows. But I need to install also python and make in cygwin.All of these programs are needed to run petsc library.
Does Someone know how to install these components in cygwin?
Assistant: In my case, it was happened due to python is not well installed. So python.exe is referenced in the shell so it can't find the file because the system is different.
Please check cygwin python is well installed.
