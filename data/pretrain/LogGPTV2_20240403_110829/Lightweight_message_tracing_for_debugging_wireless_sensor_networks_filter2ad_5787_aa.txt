## Abstract

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) often encounter complex runtime failures that are challenging to diagnose. Traditional debugging techniques for distributed systems are inapplicable due to the extreme resource constraints in WSNs. Existing WSN-specific debugging solutions either address specific types of failures, focus on individual nodes, or exhibit high overheads, limiting their scalability.

Message tracing is a critical component for efficient and effective debugging in WSNs. We propose a message tracing solution that addresses key challenges such as resource constraints, out-of-order message arrivals, and message losses, while being optimized for the common case of successful in-order message transmission. Our approach significantly reduces energy overhead (up to 95% and on average 59% smaller) compared to state-of-the-art message tracing methods using Lamport clocks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies of several complex faults in three well-known distributed protocols.

## 1. Introduction

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of numerous tiny, battery-powered sensor nodes (motes) equipped with wireless radios. These nodes sense the physical world and transmit the data to a central "base station" via multi-hop wireless communication. The compact form factor and wireless nature of WSNs make them suitable for various indoor and outdoor applications, including environmental monitoring, structural health monitoring, border surveillance, and industrial machinery monitoring.

As WSNs are increasingly deployed in harsh scientific, military, and industrial environments, they experience a variety of runtime failures. These failures can be caused by node or link failures, as well as more complex issues such as data races, timestamp overflows, transient link asymmetry, and lack of synchronization in distributed protocols and applications. Unexpected environmental factors during deployment often lead to these runtime failures, despite careful design and validation. Runtime debugging tools are essential for detecting and diagnosing generic runtime failures in WSNs.

### 1.1 Challenges in WSN Debugging

Runtime debugging in traditional resource-rich wireline networks is already challenging. Online debugging techniques, while useful for reducing fault detection latency, often incur high runtime overhead and are susceptible to Heisenbugs (faults that disappear when the system is observed). Offline debugging techniques, which require large amounts of data and non-volatile memory to store traces, are not feasible in WSNs due to their limited storage capacity.

WSN-specific online debugging approaches, though useful for small-scale testbeds, are not suitable for post-deployment debugging because they are energy-inefficient and highly susceptible to Heisenbugs. Several WSN-specific offline debugging techniques have been proposed, but they either focus on coarse-grained diagnosis, require multiple failure reproductions, or address only node-level issues. These solutions do not support generic, resource-friendly distributed diagnosis of complex failures occurring through sensor node interactions in end applications and core protocols.

### 1.2 Key Constraints for Message Tracing in WSNs

To effectively trace message sends and receives in WSNs, four key constraints must be addressed:

1. **Resource Constraints**: WSNs are highly resource-constrained, so tracing mechanisms must impose minimal overhead. Traces on individual nodes should be highly compressible to reduce storage and communication overheads.
2. **Message Losses**: Pairing message sends and receives cannot be inferred from sequences of events if messages can get lost. Best-effort transmission protocols, commonly used in WSNs, exacerbate this issue.
3. **Out-of-Order Reception**: Basic communication protocols in WSNs do not provide ordered message delivery, making it difficult to pair up message sends and receives.
4. **Local Purging**: When trace storage is full, local purging decisions must be made for energy efficiency. Limited external flash storage (about 512KB - 1MB) means traces fill up quickly, complicating the pairing of message sends and receives.

### 1.3 State-of-the-Art Limitations

Current state-of-the-art solutions, such as those using Lamport clocks, generate false positives at replay and do not inherently support message losses. They also do not scale well in terms of resource usage.

In this paper, we propose a novel message tracing scheme for WSNs that satisfies all four requirements. Our approach leverages restricted communication patterns in WSNs and includes three key ideas: (1) use of per-channel sequence numbers, (2) address aliasing, and (3) optimization for the common case of in-order reliable delivery. We combine our message traces with local control-flow traces to provide a complete view of the distributed system.

## 2. Contributions

- **Novel Distributed Message Tracing Technique**: We present a new message tracing technique that addresses the four key constraints.
- **Effectiveness Demonstration**: We show the effectiveness of our message tracing technique combined with control-flow path encoding for individual sensor nodes using the open-source TinyTracer framework, through real-world WSN distributed protocol faults.
- **Analytical and Empirical Validation**: We analytically demonstrate the significant reduction in trace size and empirically show the resulting energy savings (up to 95% and on average 59%) over the state-of-the-art, even in the presence of message losses and out-of-order arrivals.

## 3. Background and Problem Definition

### 3.1 Trace-based Debugging of Distributed Systems

Trace-based replay debugging is a promising approach for debugging distributed systems. A correct replay maintains the causal ordering of messages observed in the original execution. Causal ordering is defined as follows: a message send causally precedes its corresponding receive, and any subsequent sends by the same process. If a message \( m_1 \) is received before another message \( m_2 \) is sent, then \( m_1 \) causally precedes \( m_2 \). Causal ordering is transitive.

To obtain the causal ordering, message dependencies must be recorded in the trace. In wired distributed systems, logical clocks (e.g., Lamport clocks) are used to capture the ordering during the original execution and recreate it in the replay. While scalable, Lamport clocks are inaccurate, classifying some concurrent events as causally related. Vector clocks, which precisely capture concurrent and causally related events, can reduce trace sizes but impose high overhead and do not scale well. Most trace-based replay solutions use Lamport clocks due to their ease of implementation and scalability.

### 3.2 Inapplicability of Existing Approaches

Existing trace-based replay solutions for wired distributed systems assume abundant energy, gigabytes of storage, and kilobytes-per-second network bandwidth. They also assume a FIFO reliable communication layer like TCP. These assumptions do not hold in WSNs, which must cope with stringent resource constraints, out-of-order message arrivals, message losses, and local purging. Additionally, WSNs require highly compressible traces to manage limited storage.

Existing approaches, even those using vector clocks, cannot correctly recreate the causal order in the presence of unreliability. Combining Lamport clocks with sender addresses, as proposed by Shea, still leads to inconsistent causal ordering. Figure 1 illustrates counter-examples where traces cannot correctly pair message send and receive events in the presence of out-of-order arrivals, message losses, or local purging.

## 4. Design and Implementation

### 4.1 Per-Channel Sequence Numbers

We use per-channel sequence numbers to enable postmortem analysis to recover the original ordering despite message losses and out-of-order arrivals. Each channel has a unique sequence number, allowing us to reconstruct the correct order of messages.

### 4.2 Address Aliasing

Each node maintains a smaller ID for other nodes it frequently communicates with, reducing the size of the trace and improving compression.

### 4.3 Optimization for In-Order Delivery

Our approach is optimized for the common case of in-order reliable delivery, ensuring minimal overhead in typical scenarios.

## 5. Case Studies

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies of several common distributed protocols in WSNs, showing how our message tracing technique can accurately diagnose complex faults.

## 6. Analytical and Empirical Results

### 6.1 Space Efficiency

We analytically show the significant reduction in trace size achieved by our technique.

### 6.2 Energy Efficiency

Empirical results demonstrate the substantial energy savings (up to 95% and on average 59%) of our technique over the state-of-the-art, even in the presence of message losses and out-of-order arrivals.

## 7. Related Work

We discuss related work in WSN debugging and highlight the limitations of existing approaches.

## 8. Conclusion

In conclusion, our novel message tracing scheme for WSNs addresses the key challenges of resource constraints, message losses, out-of-order arrivals, and local purging. Our approach significantly reduces trace size and energy overhead, making it a practical and effective solution for debugging complex faults in WSNs.
