User: How to resolve code conflicts when using Git for code management?
Assistant: When Git is used for code management, code conflicts occur when two or more people modify the same file or the same line of code at the same time. The following are the steps to resolve code conflicts: 1. Pull the latest code: Before starting to modify the code, pull the latest code to ensure that your own code is kept in sync with other people's code. 2. Check conflicts: After modifying the code, execute the git status command to check whether conflicts have occurred. 3. Conflict resolution: Open the conflicting file and manually merge the code. For each conflict, Git marks <<<<<<<, ======= and >>>>>>> in the code. The code between these tags is the part that needs to be manually merged. Merge the code as the case may be, and communicate with others if necessary. 4. Submit the modification: After manually resolving the conflict, use the git add command to add the modified file, and then use the git commit command to submit the modification. 5. Merge branches: If the conflict occurs on different branches, the two branches need to be merged. Branches can be merged into the master branch using the git merge command. 6. After submitting the modification, use the git push command to submit the modification to the remote warehouse, so that others can also get the latest code.
