The CSS is correct but no matter which way it is written, the answer is
incorrect.
margin-top is not working correctly.
.green-box {  
background-color: green;  
margin-right: 20px;  
margin-bottom: 20px;  
margin-left: 40px;  
margin-top: 20px;  
}
.green-box {  
margin: 20px 20px 20px 40px;  
}
The instructions say to make margin-top: 20px. By experimenting I determined
it should be margin-top: 40px.
