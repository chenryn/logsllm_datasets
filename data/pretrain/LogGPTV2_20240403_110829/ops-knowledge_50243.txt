User: Does anybody know of a tool to test OCSP responses? Preferably, something that can be used from a Windows Command-line and/or can be included (easily) in a Java/python program
Assistant: bouncycastle has a Java crypto-provider and support for OCSP requests and responses. The differences between OCSPReq and OCSPRequest and OCSPResp and OCSPResponse class are a little confusing, though.
