**ATT&CK ID:** G0010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Turla

Upon initial check-in, Turla performs a system survey to discover remote systems on the local network. This is typically achieved using the `net view` and `net view /DOMAIN` commands. Additionally, Turla employs the following commands to enumerate domain computers, including domain controllers and Exchange servers:

- `net group "Domain Computers" /domain`
- `net group "Domain Controllers" /domain`
- `net group "Exchange Servers" /domain`

These techniques allow Turla to gather detailed information about the target organization's network infrastructure, including critical systems such as domain controllers and Exchange servers. [36][88]
