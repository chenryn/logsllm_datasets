### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.7.7
  * Java version: 1.8
### Steps to reproduce this issue
In the process of switching Zookeeper to Nacos, we found that the startup
speed of the application became slower, and a large number of Nacos threads
were created. Looking at the source code, we found that every service
registered in the application startup process would create a
**NamingService**. We started to think that was the design. After a thorough
review, we found that Dubbo had a static cache for the Nacos registry, and the
cache key contained a dynamic parameter timestamp , every time a new service
is registered, the latest value will be retrieved, and eventually the registry
static cache will be invalid.
