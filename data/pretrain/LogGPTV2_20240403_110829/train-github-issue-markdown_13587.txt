    Before filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the
    latest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the
    latest version of Go:
    Run "go version" and compare against
    http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html  If a newer version of Go exists,
    install it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.
    Thanks.
    What does 'go version' print?
    go version go1.3.2 freebsd/amd64
    What steps reproduce the problem?
    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    1. build on a platform where where clang is called "cc"
    2.
    3.
    What happened?
    What should have happened instead?
    Please provide any additional information below.
    See:
    https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/build.go#2104
            if strings.Contains(a[0], "clang") {
    On platforms where clang is called "cc" (because it's the only compiler by
    default), this code fails. In order to get clang detected properly I had to set CC=clang.
