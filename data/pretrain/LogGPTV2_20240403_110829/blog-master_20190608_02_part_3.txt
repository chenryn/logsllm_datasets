## 小结  
PostgreSQL的核心组成员、赞助商管理委员会、筹款委员会、主要代码贡献者、赞助商企业等主要角色，遍布世界各地。  
从1988年开源以来，已稳定运行，每年召开全球开发者大会，每年发布一个大版本，一个大版本维护6年，全球各地有当地的用户组，官方文档翻译数个国家，相关书籍遍布全球各个国家。  
通常开源软件的主体是一家企业，例如MongoDB,MySQL等，背后都是一家公司，开源软件只是公司的一个产品。公司对这个产品拥有绝对的控制权。  
PostgreSQL与其他大多数的开源软件不一样的地方，PostgreSQL的主体不是一家公司，而是一个社区，社区的构成成分如上：来自全球各个国家的：核心组、赞助商管理委员会、筹款委员会、代码贡献者、赞助商企业。  
PostgreSQL社区很难被任何一个商业公司、国家所控制。    
## 后话专利  
唯一可以让纯社区版数据库比较窘迫的只有专利保护控诉，例如开源数据库软件严重威胁到一些商业数据库公司的利益时，这些商业公司可能会做出动作，逼迫开源软件的某些冲突部件重写。  
PS:   PG与其他开源软件不同的是开放了大量的API（可以扩展开发编程语言、采样、类型、索引、操作符、函数、存储引擎、外部表、custom scan等），目前基于PG的外部插件生态非常丰富。  
2005年的例子:    
IBM patent sparks open source code rewrite:   
https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-patent-sparks-open-source-code-rewrite/  
The IBM patent that PostgreSQL developers are concerned about is patent number 295507, which was filed by IBM in November 2002. The patent concerns the ARC algorithm, which PostgreSQL had implemented for its caching system. PostgreSQL has now replaced its ARC algorithm and is encouraging database administrators to upgrade to PostgreSQL 8.0.2, which it says contains a "patent free" algorithm.  
IBM这件事情非常早，目前PG社区已经非常注意避免违反专利。可以看到2015年的一个邮件讨论，关于合并greenplum代码的，注意bruce momjian的回复。  
https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/PI:EMAIL  
```  
Some of you might have seen that the Greenplum database source code has  
been published:  
	https://adtmag.com/articles/2015/10/28/greenplum-open-sourced.aspx  
under the Apache 2.0 license:  
	http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0  
The source code has known patents owned by Pivotal/Greenplum.  The  
license has a patent grant clause:  
	3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this  
	License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,  
	non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in  
	this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,  
	sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license  
	applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that  
	are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by  
	combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such  
	Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation  
	against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a  
	lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within  
	the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then  
	any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work  
	shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  
However, while the license defines and uses "Derivative Works", it does  
not mention that in the patent grant clause.  I assume this means that  
patent grants do not apply to derived works, meaning if code or ideas  
were moved from Greenplum to Postgres (which is not Apache 2.0  
licensed), it would not have a patent grant. I talked to Greenplum staff  
about this a few months ago and they did not dispute my analysis.  
Therefore, I caution people from viewing the Greenplum source code as  
you might see patented ideas that could be later implemented in  
Postgres, opening Postgres up to increased patent violation problems.  I  
am also concerned about existing community members who work for  
Pivotal/Greenplum and therefore are required to view the patented source  
code.  The license issue might eventually be improved by  
Pivotal/Greenplum, but, for now, I think caution is necessary.  
Of course, never mention known-patented ideas in any community forum,  
including this email list.

又比如这个   
https://grokbase.com/t/postgresql/pgsql-hackers/073y7qnx3t/oracle-indemnifies-postgresql-on-its-patents  
```
No, you miss the point of OIN. Doing the above might make FOSS
developers free from the particular patent, but it would do nothing
to defend against the vast sea of other patents out there.
The idea of OIN is to have a large patent pool that can be
counter-asserted against anyone who doesn't want to play nice.
Mutual assured destruction in the patent sphere, if you will.
According to the cited article, Oracle hasn't donated any of their
patents to the pool (if they had, that *would* be impressive) but
they have cross-licensed their patents with those held by OIN,
ie, they've promised to play nice.
I tend to agree that we shouldn't trust Oracle further than we can
throw them, so I'm not about to go out and start looking for Oracle
patents we could use, but this does seem to remove the threat of
being blindsided from that quarter. Now we just have to worry about
Microsoft ...

PostgreSQL社区对于专利的态度：   
[《[转载] PostgreSQL and patents - PostgreSQL与专利》](../201906/20190608_04.md)  
可能PG社区最近会建立专门的专利委员会，以避免专利混战。  
关于专利，对于一家企业来说主动出击和被动防守两手都要抓。
