User: There is an existing web application with a microservice architecture that needs to be monitored and optimized to improve system performance and availability. Please provide a complete system monitoring and performance optimization solution, including the selection of monitoring indicators and the use of performance optimization tools.
Assistant: 1. Monitoring indicators 1. Basic monitoring indicators: CPU, memory, disk, network, etc., which can be monitored through the monitoring tools that come with the system. 2. Business monitoring indicators: HTTP request response time, interface call success rate, error rate, etc., can be monitored through the open source monitoring tool Prometheus. 2. Monitoring tools 1. Prometheus: An open source monitoring tool that can customize monitoring indicators and store them in a time series database, and supports functions such as alarms and chart visualization. 2. Grafana: An open source visualization tool that can be integrated with Prometheus to provide a custom display interface. 3. Jaeger: An open source distributed tracking system that can be used to analyze system call links, performance bottlenecks, etc. 3. Performance optimization tools 1. JProfiler: A commercial Java performance analysis tool that can display performance bottlenecks through various reports and charts, and can also perform code-level analysis and tracking. 2. Arthas: An open source Java performance analysis tool, which can monitor Java applications in real time through the command line, diagnose problems, locate fault points, and support hot code updates. 3. Apache JMeter: An open source stress testing tool that can simulate user requests and test the concurrency capabilities of the system. 4. Performance optimization plan 1. Database optimization: Improve database query performance through indexing, sub-table sub-database, etc., to avoid the high-concurrency database from becoming a single-point bottleneck. 2. Code optimization: Avoid unnecessary repeated calculations and IO operations, fix memory leaks and other issues, and optimize code structure. 3. Cache optimization: Use cache technology to reduce I/O load and improve system response speed. 4. Deployment optimization: Use containerization technology to improve the horizontal expansion capability of the system and realize automatic deployment and expansion.
