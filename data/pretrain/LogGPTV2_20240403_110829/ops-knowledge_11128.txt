User: I've tried pip and easy_install, but I keep getting the following error:
error: command '/usr/bin/llvm-gcc' failed with exit status 1
I'm running OSX Lion and the install runs inside a virtualenv, with Python 2.7.2.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Check if libmemcached is installed. If not found then install it with 
brew install libmemcached and rest of things will work just fine. 
I resolved this issue while installing django test suite.
