Adversaries may leverage social media platforms to gather information about their targets, which can be used in subsequent attack planning and execution. These platforms often contain a wealth of publicly available data about an organization, including business announcements, press releases, and details about the roles, locations, and personal interests of employees. This information can be exploited to tailor phishing attacks, create convincing impersonations, or identify potential vulnerabilities within the organization.
