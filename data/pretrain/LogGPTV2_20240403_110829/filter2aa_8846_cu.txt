 Asset inventory. You need to have a method for maintaining an accurate inventory of your company’s assets. For
example, you need to know how many computers you have and how many installations of each licensed software
application you have. Asset inventory helps organizations protect physical assets from theft, maintain software
licensing compliance, and account for the inventory (for example, depreciating the assets). There are other benefits
too. For example, if a vulnerability is identified in a specific version of an application, you can use your asset
inventory to figure out whether you have any installations of the vulnerable version.
 Asset management. Assets, such as computers, desks and software applications, have a lifecycle — simply put,
you buy it, you use it and then you retire it. Asset management is the process of managing that lifecycle. You keep
track of all your assets, including when you got it, how much you paid for it, its support model and when you need
to replace it. For example, asset management can help your IT team figure out which laptops to replace during the
next upgrade cycle. It can also help you control costs by finding overlap in hardware, software or other assets.
 Configuration management. Configuration management helps you standardize a configuration across your
devices. For example, you can use configuration management software to ensure that all desktop computers have
anti-virus software and the latest patches, and that the screen will automatically be locked after 5 minutes of
inactivity. The configuration management system should automatically remediate most changes users make to a
system. The benefits of configuration management include having a single configuration (for example, all servers
have the same baseline services running and the same patch level), being able to manage many systems as a single
unit (for example, you can deploy an updated anti-malware application to all servers the same amount of time it
takes to deploy it to a single server), and being able to report on the configuration throughout your network (which
can help to identify anomalies). Many configuration management solutions are OS-agnostic, meaning that they can
be used across Windows, Linux and Mac computers. Without a configuration management solution, the chances
of having a consistent and standardized deployment plummets, and you lose the efficiencies of configuring many
computers as a single unit.
7.5 Understand and apply foundational security operations concepts
This section covers some of the foundational items for security operations. Many of these concepts apply to several other
sections on the exam. You should have a very firm grasp of these topics so that you can navigate them effectively throughout
the other sections.
 Need-to-know and least privilege. Access should be given based on a need to know. For example, a system
administrator who is asked to disable a user account doesn’t need to know that the user was terminated, and a
systems architect who is asked to evaluate an IT inventory list doesn’t need to know that his company is considering
acquiring another company. The principle of least privilege means giving users the fewest privileges they need to
perform their job tasks; entitlements are granted only after a specific privilege is deemed necessary. It is a good
practice and almost always a recommend practice. Two other concepts are important here:
 Aggregation. The combining of multiple things into a single unit is often used in role-based access control.
71
 Transitive trust. From a Microsoft Active Directory perspective, a root or parent domain automatically
trusts all child domains. Because of the transitivity, all child domains also trust each other. Transitivity
makes it simpler to have trusts. But it is important to be careful. Consider outside of Active Directory: If
Chris trusts Terry and Pat trusts Terry, should Chris trust Pat? Probably not. In high-security environments,
it isn’t uncommon to see non-transitive trusts used, depending on the configuration and requirements.
 Separation of duties and responsibilities. Separation of duties refers to the process of separating certain tasks
and operations so that a single person doesn’t control all them. For example, you might dictate that one person is
the security administrator and another is the email administrator. Each has administrative access to only their area.
You might have one administrator responsible for authentication and another responsible for authorization. The
goal with separation of duties is to make it more difficult to cause harm to the organization (via destructive actions
or data loss, for example). With separation of duties, it is often necessary to have two or more people working
together (colluding) to cause harm to the organization. Separation of duties is not always practical, though. For
example, in a small company, you might only have one person doing all the IT work, or one person doing all the
accounting work. In such cases, you can rely on compensating controls or external auditing to minimize risk.
 Privileged account management. A special privilege is a right not commonly given to people. For example, certain
IT staff might be able to change other users’ passwords or restore a system backup, and only certain accounting
staff can sign company checks. Actions taken using special privileges should be closely monitored. For example,
each user password reset should be recorded in a security log along with pertinent information about the task:
date and time, source computer, the account that had its password changed, the user account that performed the
change, and the status of the change (success or failure). For high-security environments, you should consider a
monitoring solution that offers screen captures or screen recording in addition to the text log.
 Job rotation. Job rotation is the act of moving people between jobs or duties. For example, an accountant might
move from payroll to accounts payable and then to accounts receivable. The goal of job rotation is to reduce the
length of one person being in a certain job (or handling a certain set of responsibilities) for too long, which
minimizes the chances of errors or malicious actions going undetected. Job rotation can also be used to cross-train
members of teams to minimize the impact of an unexpected leave of absence.
 Information lifecycle. Information lifecycle is made up of the following phases:
 Collect data. Data is gathered from sources such as log files and inbound email, and when users produce
data such as a new spreadsheet.
 Use data. Users read, edit and share data.
 Retain data (optional). Data is archived for the time required by the company’s data retention policies.
For example, some companies retain all email data for 7 years by archiving the data to long-term storage
until the retention period has elapsed.
 Legal hold (occasional). A legal hold requires you to maintain one or more copies of specified data in an
unalterable form during a legal scenario (such as a lawsuit) or an audit or government investigation. A legal
hold is often narrow; for example, you might have to put a legal hold on all email to or from the accounts
payable department. In most cases, a legal hold is invisible to users and administrators who are not involved
in placing the hold.
72
 Delete data. The default delete action in most operating systems is not secure: The data is marked as
deleted, but it still resides on the disks and can be easily recovered with off-the-shelf software. To have an
effective information lifecycle, you must use secure deletion techniques such as disk wiping (for example,
by overwriting the data multiple times), degaussing and physical destruction (shredding a disk).
 Service-level agreements (SLAs). An SLA is an agreement between a provider (which could be an internal
department) and the business that defines when a service provided by the department is acceptable. For example,
the email team might have an SLA that dictates that they will provide 99.9% uptime each month or that spam email
will represent 5% or less of the email in user mailboxes. SLAs can help teams design appropriate solutions. For
example, if an SLA requires 99.9% uptime, a team might focus on high availability and site resiliency. Sometimes,
especially with service providers, not adhering to SLAs can result in financial penalties. For example, an internet
service provider (ISP) might have to reduce its monthly connection charges if it does not meet its SLA.
7.6 Apply resource protection techniques
This section covers media, hardware and software management. We will look at some key tips for managing media and
using asset management for software and hardware.
 Media management. Media management is the act of maintaining media for your software and data. This includes
operating system images, installation files and backup media. Any media that you use in your organization
potentially falls under this umbrella. There are some important media management concepts to know:
 Source files. If you rely on software for critical functions, you need to be able to reinstall that software at
any time. Despite the advent of downloadable software, many organizations rely on legacy software that
they purchased on disk years ago and that is no longer available for purchase. To protect your organization,
you need to maintain copies of the media along with copies of any license keys.
 Operating system images. You need a method to manage your operating system images so that you can
maintain clean images, update the images regularly (for example, with security updates), and use the
images for deployments. Not only should you maintain multiple copies at multiple sites, but you should
also test the images from time to time. While you can always rebuild an image from your step-by-step
documentation, that lost time could cost your company money during an outage or other major issue.
 Backup media. Backup media is considered sensitive media. While many organizations encrypt backups
on media, you still need to treat the backup media in a special way to reduce the risk of it being stolen and
compromised. Many companies lock backup media in secure containers and store the containers in a
secure location. It is also common to use third-party companies to store backup media securely in off-site
facilities.
 Hardware and software asset management. At first glance, asset management might not seem related to
security operations, but it actually is. For example, if a vendor announces a critical vulnerability in a specific version
of a product that allows remote code execution, you need to quickly act to patch your devices — which means you
need to be able to quickly figure out if you have any devices that are vulnerable. You can’t do that without effective
asset management (and, in some cases, configuration management). Here are some key tasks for an asset
management solution:
73
 Capture as much data as you reasonably can. You need to know where a given product is installed. But
you also need to know when it was installed (for example, whether a vulnerable version was installed after
the company announced the vulnerability), the precise version number (because without that, you might
not be able to effectively determine whether you are susceptible), and other details.
 Have a robust reporting system. You need to be able to use all the asset management data you collect,
so you need a robust reporting system that you can query on demand. For example, you should be able to
quickly get a report listing all computers running a specific version of a specific software product. And you
should then be able to filter that data to only corporate-owned devices or laptop computers.
 Integrate asset management with other automation software. If your asset management solution
discovers 750 computers running a vulnerable version of a piece of software, you need an automated way
to update the software to the latest version. You can do that by integrating your asset management system
with your configuration management system. Some vendors offer an all-in-one solution that performs both
asset management and configuration management.
7.7 Conduct incident management
Incident management is the management of incidents that are potentially damaging to an organization, such as a
distributed denial of service attack. Not all incidents are computer-related; for example, a break-in at your CEO’s office is
also an incident.
 Detection. It is critical to be able to detect incidents quickly because they often become more damaging at time
passes. It is important to have a robust monitoring and intrusion detection solution in place. Other parts of a
detection system include security cameras, motion detectors, smoke alarms and other sensors. If there is a security
incident, you want to be alerted (for example, if an alarm is triggered at your corporate headquarters over a holiday
weekend).
 Response. When you receive a notification about an incident, you should start by verifying the incident. For
example, if an alarm was triggered at a company facility, a security guard can physically check the surroundings for
an intrusion and check the security cameras for anomalies. For computer-related incidents, it is advisable to keep
compromised systems powered on to gather forensic data. Along with the verification process, during the response
phase you should also kick off the initial communication with teams or people that can help with mitigation. For
example, you should contact the information security team initially during a denial-of-service attack.
 Mitigation. The next step is to contain the incident. For example, if a computer has been compromised and is
actively attempting to compromise other computers, the compromised computer should be removed from the
network to mitigate the damage.
 Reporting. Next, you should disseminate data about the incident. You should routinely inform the technical teams
and the management teams about the latest findings regarding the incident.
 Recovery. In the recovery phase, you get the company back to regular operations. For example, for a compromised
computer, you re-image it or restore it from a backup. For a broken window, you replace it.
74
 Remediation. In this phase, you take additional steps to minimize the chances of the same or a similar attack being
successful. For example, if you suspect that an attacker launched attacks from the company’s wireless network,
you should update the wireless password or authentication mechanism. If an attacker gained access to sensitive
plain text data during an incident, you should encrypt the data in the future.
 Lessons learned. During this phase, all team members who worked on the security incident gather to review the
incident. You want to find out which parts of the incident management were effective and which were not. For
example, you might find that your security software detected an attack immediately (effective) but you were unable
to contain the incident without powering off all the company’s computers (less effective). The goal is to review the
details to ensure that the team is better prepared for the next incident.
7.8 Operate and maintain detective and preventative measures
This section deals with the hands-on work of operating and maintaining security systems to block attacks on your company’s
environment or minimize their impact.
 Firewalls. While operating firewalls often involves adding and editing rules and reviewing logs, there are other
tasks that are important, too. For example, review the firewall configuration change log to see which configuration
settings have been changed recently.
 Intrusion detection and prevention systems. You need to routinely evaluate the effectiveness of your IDS and
IPS systems. You also need to review and fine-tune the alerting functionality. If too many alerts are sent (especially
false positive or false negatives), administrators will often ignore or be slow to respond to alerts, causing response
to a real incident alert to be delayed.
 Whitelisting and blacklisting. Whitelisting is the process of marking applications as allowed, while blacklisting is
the process of marking applications as disallowed. Whitelisting and blacklisting can be automated. It is common to
whitelist all the applications included on a corporate computer image and disallow all others.
 Security services provided by third parties. Some vendors offer security services that ingest the security-related
logs from your entire environment and handle detection and response using artificial intelligence or a large
network operations center. Other services perform assessments, audits or forensics. Finally, there are third-party
security services that offer code review, remediation or reporting.
 Sandboxing. Sandboxing is the act of totally segmenting an environment or a computer from your production
networks and computers; for example, a company might have a non-production environment on a physically
