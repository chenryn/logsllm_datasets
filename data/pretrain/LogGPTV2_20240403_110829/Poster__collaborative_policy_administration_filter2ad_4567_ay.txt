project has to be localized, someone has to adopt it,” 
she notes .16 She explains that sometimes a project has 
great potential, but it may not be implemented because 
of budget limitations, or a competing project elsewhere. 
What is crucial is that the ideas circulate and gain an 
audience, she stresses, “it’s important to keep ideas 
circulating so they catch on, if more and more people 
are exposed to them they are more likely to happen.”17 
An ecology of innovation approach recognizes that 
ideas not only have to be generated but also need 
time to circulate and be accepted before they can 
become reality; this process assures many perspectives 
enter the project, fine-tuning it to local needs while 
maintaining a larger scope. For The Studio, working 
with the IwB created more visibility for local projects, 
stirring organizational synergies and wider debate 
locally, demonstrating that innovation is not only the 
idea generating process itself and the tools created to 
foster it, but rather the larger process of creating onsite 
and virtual spaces where innovation can be harnessed 
and propagated. 
CONCLUSION
Sabrina Dominguez, a student at the IwB working 
on the Dublin Project, describes The Studio as a 
department that keeps at “arms-length” from the 
other municipal departments, they intentionally keep 
a “foot in and out of city operations.”18 Susan Speigel,

a Toronto based architect and an IwB advisor, states 
“The Studio is like a COLAB, a think tank that acts as 
a bridge between the municipality, the citizens, and 
industry,” a space where municipal employees can 
“innovate from the inside.”19 The key to forming lasting 
innovation in public service is this fringe positioning 
that bridges the social, political, business, technical, 
and design aspects of the ecology of innovation. 
A design studio is an advisory body capable of 
researching, organizing, presenting, and circulating 
new concepts in public service. It is a process through 
which the government, community, industry, not for 
profits, and other design studios can debate and 
propose solutions. Importantly, it is also a place where 
new ideas can be presented, stored, and circulated. 
There are many differences between Markham 
and Dublin and this paper has not tried to form a 
comparison, but rather present two case studies taken 
on by the IwB. Markham is a new municipality that faces 
problems typical of an edge city, while Dublin is one 
of Europe’s oldest cities, dense, diverse, and politically 
complex. Yet there are similarities here. Through 
the Dublin Project, The Studio has gained ground in 
implementing many new ideas in Dublin, and the City of 
Markham is, since the COLAB Project, contemplating a 
change lab as a permanent feature in Markham.
Municipal governments are recognizing that developing 
better relationships with their citizens and industry 
can lead to improved city processes. Today’s municipal 
leadership is seeing the necessity in interdisciplinary 
design studios collaborations as a way to build and 
pilot solutions to city challenges. But it takes an 
open attitude. The Dublin Project and COLAB Project 
participants emphasized that Markham’s and Dublin’s 
city managers created an environment of respect and 
curiosity, they were open to innovative ideas and willing 
to take risks. Further, design can act as a bridge that 
synergizes the different stakeholders needed for lasting 
social innovation to happen in public service, but it 
doesn’t do so over night. Navigating the constellation of 
bus
factors that make up innovation, levering that ecology in 
a neutral space is a localized and evolving process that 
requires continuous public debate; ideas need to be 
circulated in the public domain, they also need a space 
where they can be cultivated to drive change.

IMPLICATIONS FOR: 
DESIGN PRACTICE
An ecology of innovation approach is inclusive. It places social innovation in a 
context where innovation synergies can enhance project viability. By designing 
together, co-creating with the public, clients, sponsors, and professionals of various 
disciplines, holistic propositions can be developed into formats that society can 
adopt. Design studios must engage in deeper research that considers an ecology of 
innovation in each project. Collaboration with other design studios, think tanks, not 
for profits, etc. enhances projects by diversifying the conceptual ground from which 
project ideas spring forth. 
DESIGN EDUCATION
Design education must constantly evolve technologically, but also methodologically. 
While it is important to give students practical training in design skills and historical 
context to their design learning, design education must equally concentrate on 
method. Design program curriculums that are flexible can gain insights from 
student feedback and evolve the curriculum. Design programs can similarly benefit 
from working with real world partners and on real world problems that force new 
methods, tools, and strategies. The IwB’s Interdisciplinary Design Strategy Program 
curriculum emphasizes immersion of students in projects and professionalization; 
ongoing contact with the clients, accountability for the project deliverables, 
integration with a global network of experts that advise the project and face to 
face contact with the project’s users. The IwB curriculum both mirrors design firm 
practices because students are engaged in the design process from conception of 
projects ideas, to research, prototyping, visualization stages, and project testing and 
delivery, but also differs from firm practices because unlike a design firm the IwB’s 
ecology of innovation methodology forces a trans-system analysis.
POLICYMAKING
The Studio in Dublin, as well the proposal for a COLAB in Markham, demonstrate 
the advantages of interdisciplinary hubs working with municipalities. These labs are 
new phenomena in public service design, but an increasing number of municipalities 
globally are looking to harness interdisciplinary and design thinking methodologies 
because they are faced with increasingly complex challenges and have limited 
budgets. Collaboration with design schools and design studios can invigorate public 
policy, strengthening internal communication, developing new relationships with 
citizens, industry, and other city organizations. A public sector that is forward thinking 
and anticipatory should be open to new methods that will better equip it to face the 
increasingly multi-directional and multi-faceted challenges affecting citizen’s lives.

“What safe spaces can teenagers claim for themselves? 
Policy makers must begin to address this question in 
urban centers and involve youth planning in these 
spaces.”
Teen Art Park Partner, in studio critique at  
Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, Summer 2012. 
1.  INTRODUCTION
Today, there is widespread understanding among 
policymakers, community leaders, designers and 
educators that creating public spaces that build 
flourishing, inclusive communities and promote a sense 
of belonging, local identity and social networks is a 
difficult undertaking. Imagining such spaces that target 
a teen demographic not usually served by any planning 
or creative process becomes even more of a challenge. 
The Teen Art Park project addresses that challenge 
head on.  A community-driven vision for a dynamic 
public venue with innovative infrastructure and arts 
programming benefiting underserved populations 
of teens in the cities of Pasadena and Altadena, 
California, it puts forward a compelling case study. 
Notions of well-being and quality of life, as well as 
emerging issues concerning participation, needs and 
social capital among a diversity of stakeholders may 
well be “soft” indicators of the resiliency and creativity 
of our built environment, but they are also increasingly 
recognized as key determinants of cohesive and 
socially sustainable communities.1 These are the 
vibrant communities we all strive to live and work in, 
as well as to call home: ones in which the design of 
the physical realm supports social and cultural life, 
systems for civic engagement and space for all people 
to evolve and thrive.
What might be new approaches to designing places 
that can shape the aspirations and opportunities of 
teens from seriously disadvantaged backgrounds? How 
might one envision safe spaces for creative expression 
that these teens can claim for themselves? These 
interrelated questions provided a critical point of 
departure for the collaborative framework that drove 
forward the vision for the Teen Art Park Project.
1.2 Vision & Design Brief  
The concept was simple: an innovative arts center for 
at-risk youth.  A place where teenagers could more 
than just escape from their problems, but would also 
be encouraged to deal with them through the arts.   
Believing that people’s lives might be transformed if 
given the chance to channel their negative emotions 
into positive ones through the canvas, the wall, paper 
or a loud speaker, Art Center students sought out to 
design a venue for self-expression and an art park to 
foster social change for at-risk teens. 
The park concept was developed during a two-term 
trans-disciplinary studio led by the Environmental 
Design Department in the 2011 spring and summer 
academic terms. But it was born over months of 
conversation among twenty-nine community partners. 
Among those contributing ideas, insight and resources 
along the way were the Flintridge Center, the Armory

The design brief called for students from 
environmental design, product design, illustration 
and graphic design to consider and create alternative 
positive environments for youth to explore various 
forms of art-making activities.3
Over the two core academic terms that comprised the 
investigation and collaboration with partners, students 
formed small teams and worked in the first studio to
