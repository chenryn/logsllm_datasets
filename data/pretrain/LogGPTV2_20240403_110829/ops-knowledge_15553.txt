User: This is a really annoying problem. I've prowled the web for solutions, but all I found was tips about changing the PATH variable, which I did, of course. My Python install directory is C:\Python27. It' a 32 bit version. Whenever I type python in the command prompt, it says that it isn't recognised as an internal or external command. Currently, my PATH variable is set to C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\;C:\Python27\Scripts. Anyone has any ideas? I run Windows 7 by the way (64 bit). I'm pretty desperate. Heck, if nothing works I guess I'll try dual-booting Linux and Windows 7...
Assistant: When installing, there is a checkbox that is by default not selected, but it asks to add python to the environment variable. Re-install and check that box.
I'd rather the installer do it than struggle in the weeds myself.
