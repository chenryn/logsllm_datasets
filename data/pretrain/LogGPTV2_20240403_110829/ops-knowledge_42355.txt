I recently created a virtual environment for my project, but I'm encountering difficulties when trying to activate it. The issue might be related to syntax or folder location, but I'm currently unsure.

Below are the steps I followed:
1. I created the virtual environment and named it `venv`. The process seemed to complete successfully.
2. I attempted to activate the virtual environment by running the command `source venv/bin/activate`.

However, I received the following error message:
```
'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

I suspect this might be due to my system path, but I'm not sure what to point it to (although I do know how to edit the path). I am using Python 3.7 on Windows OS with virtualenv 20.2.x.

Here is the output from creating the virtual environment:
```
Processing dependencies for virtualenv
Finished processing dependencies for virtualenv

c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
The --no-site-packages flag is deprecated; it is now the default behavior.
Using real prefix 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python'
New python executable in venv\Scripts\python.exe
File venv\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg exists with different content; not overwriting
Installing setuptools.................done.
Installing pip...................done.
```

And here are the attempts to activate the virtual environment:
```
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>source venv/bin/activate
'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>source venv/bin/activate
'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>source mysite/bin/activate
'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

After some research, I found that the correct way to activate a virtual environment on Windows is to use the following command:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

This worked for me, and I hope it helps others who encounter the same issue.
