recording either before or after the ringer goes off at the victim’s
side. We set forth to analyze how the correlation values change
when the victim’s ringer goes off at different points of time.
Attack Analysis: Sound-Proof compares 3-second long audio
samples, as discussed in Section 2.3. Let us say the victim receives
call/notiﬁcation by an attacker at the nth second. The attacker starts
the authentication at the tth second. This is when Sound-Proof
starts recording at both sides. If Sound-Proof starts recording at t
such that t  n, the correlation should drop as the two audio samples
are not synchronized. However, the correlation after the ringer has
started ringing (t > n) is higher than that when there was no au-
dio at all (t  (n − 3)
proves this pattern as depicted in Figures 2a and 2b.
Figure 3: Analyzing Facebook notiﬁcation audio sample (∼687ms long).
The ﬁrst audio sample (top) represents the audio played by the attacker. The
second audio sample (middle) and the third audio sample (bottom) represent
the audio recorded at victim’s side when the notiﬁcation audio rings after or
before the attacker’s side, respectively.
To further analyze this property, we choose Facebook notiﬁca-
tion attack instead of call attack for simplicity. We use Audacity3
to analyze why the correlation in Figure 2d increases at t = 3.4
second and drops only after t = 4.6 second while the exact match
occurs at 4th second as illustrated in Figure 3. The ﬁrst audio signal
in Figure 3 represents the audio signal that the attacker plays at its
terminal which is 3 second long. The audio due to Facebook no-
tiﬁcation has audible signal of length 687ms which starts at 1.26th
second. The second audio signal represents the audio recorded by
the app at victim’s terminal for t = 4.6 second where the notiﬁ-
cation ringtone goes off at 1.60th second. The third audio signal
represents the audio recorded by the app at victim’s terminal for
t = 3.4 second where the notiﬁcation ringtone goes off at 0.90th
second in the 3 second long audio. From these three audio samples,
we can see that whenever there is an overlap between the audible
sounds, the correlation rises despite the time lag bound to 150ms.
This is because when there is some audio, the correlation values
from some of the 1/3-octave bands out of 20 bands increase, in-
creasing the overall average correlation value.
Real Attacks and Success Rates: After analyzing the attack
methodologies mentioned above, we set forth to perform the real
attacks. To perform such attacks, the attacker needs to: (1) make a
call/send a message via different apps to a victim’s smartphone, (2)
log in from a browser on a terminal which it fully controls, and (3)
play the ringtone or a notiﬁcation sound that the victim device may
generate due to attacker’s call/message. At the attacker’s end, we
used an LG G3 phone and a MacBook Air and, at the victim’s end,
we used a Samsung Galaxy S5 phone. The attacker ﬁrst observed
how long it takes for another device to ring in each different app

when it makes a call to the corresponding apps. Then, the attacker
made calls to the victim’s device from those apps. The attacker
tried to synchronize the ringtone played when it logs in from the
Google Chrome browser on MacBook Air.
We tested different attacks (active calls and notiﬁcations) against
our implementation of the Sound-Proof system, and collected the
audio samples stored in the victim’s smartphone and the audio up-
loaded to the server from the attacker’s browser. The success rates
for our attacks with the correlation threshold Tc = 0.1524 for dif-
ferent types of attacks are shown in Table 1. We can see that many
of our attacks were highly successful, including WhatsApp, Face-
book and Viber calling, Viber notiﬁcation and alarm. We also used
vibration based attack where the noise is produced by a vibration
of the phone instead of the phone playing a ringtone during a call.
We placed the phone in different location such as on desk, inside
a pocket, inside a bag, and in hand to see if the audio detected
by the phone for such placements of the phone affects the attack
success rate. Table 1 also shows the attack success rate when the
threshold was increased to Tc = 0.18 and Tc = 0.2. When the
correlation threshold is increased, the attack success rate decreases
slightly as expected (although many attacks are still highly success-
ful). We note that increasing the threshold would make the attacks
little harder but at the expense of usability since even legitimate
user may be prevented from logging in more frequently. Further
experiments revealed that the attack success rate did not change
even when the victim device was placed in front of a television
with high volume. This conﬁrmed our hypothesis that the sounds
of the phone will dominate the sounds of the ambient surroundings.
4.2 Passive Alarm Attack
As described in Section 3.2, the attacker could execute the alarm
attack at a speciﬁc time of the day (assuming the attacker knows
when the alarm will go off at the victim’s phone). Here, the at-
tacker may know the timezone of the victim (through leaked pass-
word databases). Since the attacker has control over the browser
and the device it is using at its end, the attacker can change its own
timezone to be synchronized with that of the victims. To simu-
late this setting, we played LG G5’s default alarm in front of the
browser while the phone was set to create the alarm at a ﬁxed time
instance. Since both phones played the same alarm simultaneously
at different ends, we achieved high correlation for the alarm attack
reﬂecting to 100.00% success rate with Tc = 0.1524. The success
rate decreased when we increase the correlation threshold, but we
could still achieve 80% success rate. The result for this attack for
different threshold is summarized in Table 1 (last row).

To support the claims and assumptions made in Section 3, we
conducted a survey by recruiting Amazon Mechanical Turk work-
ers. The study was approved by our University’s IRB. The partici-
pation in the study was strictly voluntary and participants could opt
out of the study at any time. The survey took only about 10 minutes
for each participant, for which they were compensated $0.7. In this
section, we discuss the design and results from this survey.
5.1 Study Design
To better inform the design and execution of our attacks in the
real-world, we asked the participants to answer several questions
about their smartphone usage, including their habits of using the
smartphones, the smartphone applications they use, and the ring-
tone and the notiﬁcation sound they set or prefer to use. Below we
summarize the set of questions we posed during the survey:
Demographic Information: We asked the participants about their
gender, age, education, industry or ﬁeld they belong to, country of
residence, and their general computer knowledge.
Applications: We asked the participants about the applications in-
stalled and used on the phone, particularly those that generate a
ringtone or a notiﬁcation sound (e.g., Google Voice, FaceTime,
Skype, Viber, Tango, ooVoo, LINE, WhatsApp, Telegram Mes-
senger, Facebook, Phone, Text Message, Alarm Clock, and Cal-
endar). Such applications are the primary target of the attacker in
our Sound-Danger system.
Notiﬁcations and Sounds: We queried about the type of ringtone
(e.g., default, vibrate, silent), and notiﬁcation tones that the partici-
pants set for their applications in different situations and time of the
day (e.g., while at work or asleep). If a particular popular ringtone
is set often, the attacker can possibly attack many participants with
our ringtone attack.
5.2 Study Results
General and Technical Background: We recruited 113 Amazon
Mechanical Turk workers. Almost equal number of male (50.82%)
and female (49.18%) users participated in the study. Although we
did not set any geographical restriction, majority of the participants
were from U.S.A (73%) and India (21%). The participants were
falling in the age group 18 to 65, precisely 18-24 (12.30%), 25-
34 (54.92%), 35-44 (22.95%), 45-54 (8.20%), and 55-64 (1.64%).
The participants had high school (6.56%), college degree (25.41%),
Associate degree (7.38%), Bachelor’s degree (40%), Master’s de-
gree (1.72%), and Doctorate degree (2.46%). The participants were
from different industrial background including: education, techni-
cal services, marketing, information technology, health care, and
ﬁnancial services. The demographic information shows that the
survey covers a representative sample of real-world users.
The participants seem to have a reasonable general computer
background as they ranked their general computer skill mostly as
good (40%) and excellent (45%). We asked the users about their
choice of username and password. The result shows that many
users reuse the same username and/or password over multiple ser-
vices. We will discuss in Section 7 that reusing the username may
help an attacker who has compromised the web-service and knows
the username of the victim to more successfully perform the ringing
attack on an application (e.g., Skype) with the same username.
Habits of Using Smartphone and Apps: All of our participants
said they have a smartphone. 80% of the participants said they
carry their phone all the time and they have their phone connected
to Internet always or most of the time. Most of the participants had
voice, text and data services activated in their plan. Apple iPhone

with over 39% and Samsung with 27% were the two most popu-
lar phone brands (other popular brands were: LG, Motorola, and
HTC). The information obtained from this part of the survey shows
that launching the introduced attack would be feasible, since many
of the participants have a smartphone with voice/data/text plans that
can be used by the attacker in an active attack.
All the participants in the survey said they frequently use phone
calling and text messaging applications. The most popular instant
messaging applications installed on participants’ phones were:
Facebook, Skype, Google Voice, FaceTime, WhatsApp and Viber.
Application with higher popularity (such as Skype) especially those
for which people use default ringing tone are the most attractive tar-
