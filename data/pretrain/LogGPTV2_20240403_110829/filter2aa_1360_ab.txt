computing environment. I was motivated to begin with this topic after teaching a multiple-day OSINT class. 
On day two, several attendees brought laptop computers in order to attempt the techniques I was teaching 
during the course. During a break, I observed police officers searching Facebook on patrol vehicle laptops; 
private investigators using Windows XP while browsing suspects' blogs; and cyber security professionals looking 
at hacker websites without possessing any antivirus software, script blockers, or a virtual private network (\TN).

In a perfect world, you have just purchased a brand-new computer and are ready to tackle your first investigation 
with it. There is no contamination because you have yet to turn it on. In the real world, you are stuck with used 
equipment, repurposed gear, and outdated operating systems. Regardless of whether you have a new machine 
or a hand-me-down, this chapter contains steps we must take before going online. Let’s begin with the used 
machine.
Now imagine that you begin an investigation into a target on this same machine. A Google search leads you to 
an Amazon Wishlist. Loading to that page connects your Amazon account to the query’, and your name is visible 
within the screen capture. Even when you log out of services such as Amazon, persistent "cookies" linger and 
let companies know you are still online. They follow you to websites you visit, attempting to collect your interests 
in order to present targeted advertisements. Your fingerprint is now all over this investigation. I pick on Amazon, 
but Google, Facebook, and others are much worse.
Assume you possess a laptop computer which you have had for a year or two. You installed some traditional 
software such as Microsoft Office and maybe added a better browser such as Firefox. You have checked your 
email, logged in to your Amazon account, and browsed the web as anyone else would with their own machine. 
Each time you visit any website, you collect detailed temporary’ files which are personalized only for you. They 
contain session details and account profile data. We all constandy leave a digital trail within every device we 
touch.
What data is on your computer? Is there a virus, malicious software, or spyware hanging around from casual 
browsing in questionable places? Does your internet cache include tracking cookies from Amazon, Facebook, 
Google, and others? Is there evidence of your last investigation stored within your bookmarks, documents, or 
download queue? If the answer is "maybe" or "I don't know" to any of these, you have a contaminated computer. 
If your investigation enters court testimony, you may have a lot of explaining to do once an expert witness who 
specializes in computer forensics takes the stand. If your screen captures display’ evidence unrelated to your 
investigation, you could compromise the entire case. You may think I am being overly cautious, but we can no 
longer take any chances when it comes to the purity of our online evidence.
We can avoid all of this. I present a firm rule w’hich will not sit w’ell with all readers. You should possess a 
dedicated machine for the sole use of online investigations. It should have no personal usage and no unnecessary- 
activity. It should be a machine only used as part of your profession. Even if you only have a used computer.
If I have not convinced you that your machine is contaminated, consider the following scenario, which happened 
to me many years prior to this writing. While investigating your suspect, you check your email in another brow ser 
tab. You also take advantage of various instant messenger applications in order to communicate with colleagues. 
You finish your investigation and submit your evidence for discovery’. A suppression hearing is scheduled 
because the opposing party’ in your case wants evidence throw’n out. During arguments, the other side demands 
an exact clone of die computer used during the investigation be provided to their own digital examiner. The 
judge agrees, and orders you to allow’ the opposing side to make an identical clone of your machine. You begin 
thinking about the personal activity and online purchases which are now going to surface during this trial.
First, we need to focus on the idea of a clean host. Your host machine is your traditional physical computer. It 
may be the laptop or desktop owned by your agency or purchased with personal funds. It is the device which 
you obtain your access to the internet, but not necessarily the direct avenue which will be used for vour 
investigations. In the next chapter, I present my options for protection during online investigations by using a 
virtual machine (VM) on top of your host. Before we can consider building a VM, we must know we have a 
host without any’ contamination.

Just remove my files

Remove files and clean the drive
There are a dozen popular antivirus companies that will provide a free solution. For most Windows users, I 
simply recommend to use Microsoft’s products. Users of Windows 7 should use Microsoft Security Essentials, 
while Windows 8 and 10 users should use the default Windows Defender included with their installation. Privacy 
enthusiasts will disagree with this advice, and I understand their stance. Microsoft products tend to collect your 
computer usage history and analyze the data. Unfortunately, their core operating systems also do this, and it is 
difficult to disable long term. Therefore, I believe that Windows users are already disclosing sensitive 
information to Microsoft. Using their antivirus soludons will not likely enhance the data being collected.
Windows: First and foremost, backup any important data. Connect an external drive via USB and copy any 
documents, configuration files, and media which will be removed when you reformat the machine. Common 
locations include the Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders within the home folder of the current user. 
Double check that you have everything you need, because the next step is to remove all data from the drive. 
Most modern Windows computers possess a hidden "restore" partition. To factory reset Windows 10, go to 
Stan > Settings > Update & Security > Recovery and click the "Get staned" button under "Reset this PC". 
Select "Remove everything", which results in the following two options:
you can bring life back to the machine and start over. This requires much more than simply deleting files and 
running a computer cleaning application. These only remove the obvious data, and will never truly eliminate all 
contamination from the machine. To do things right, we must completely reformat and reinstall all software. 
This will erase all data on your machine, so proceed with caution! This section is optional. Let's attack 
this from the twro most common operating systems.
Mac: Similar to Windows, make a backup of any valuable data. Common locations include the Desktop, 
Downloads, and Documents folders within the home folder of the current user. Restart the computer and 
immediately hold the "command" and "R" keys until you see the Apple logo. Release the keys and proceed to 
the next step. While in Recovery Mode, you will see the "macOS Utilities" window. Choose Disk Utility and 
click Continue, then select your startup disk and click Erase. Select Mac OS Extended Qoumaled) as the format, 
click Erase, and wait until the process is finished. With your hard drive completely erased and free of any data, 
you can perform a clean installation of macOS. From the same macOS Utilities window, choose Reinstall macOS 
(Reinstall OS X in older versions). Allow the process to complete and reboot the machine. Create a generic login 
account and you have a brand-new system.
You should now have a computer with no previous internet usage. This is our clean host. Now, we need to 
apply protection to the host, including antivirus and a solid VPN. It is likely that most readers already have an 
antivirus solution and are insulted at the mention of it in a book like this. I will keep my thoughts very brief. If 
you are using Microsoft Windows, you absolutely need antivirus software. If you are using an Apple computer, 
you might not Antivirus applications only protect against known variants of viruses. They do not stop 
everything. A new virus can often bypass the best software detection solutions. A better defense is applying 
better browsing habits instead of relying on an application.
Choose the "clean the drive" option and wait for completion. The result will be a new operating system free of 
any previous contamination. If you do not have this option, or possess an older Windows operating system, you 
will need the original installation media or a restore CD from the manufacturer. Upon boot, refuse any requests 
to create a Microsoft account, and only provide the necessary information to log in to Windows, such as a vague 
username and password. I prefer to eliminate any internet connection to this machine before I conduct this 
activity. This usually prevents Microsoft from demanding an online account.

brew install clamav
After Brew is installed, type the following commands, hitting "Return” after each line, into the same Terminal 
application used previously.
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)”
First, you must install a package manager called Brew. This program is very beneficial when there is a need to 
install programs that would usually already be present on a Linux computer. It also happens to have a pre­
configured version of ClamAV ready to go. The easiest way to install Brew is to visit the website brew.sh and 
copy and paste the following command into the Terminal application (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
KnockKnock (objective-see.com/products/knockknock.html): Similar to the previous option, which is 
maintained by the same company, this program conducts a scan of your Mac device. However, it is looking for 
persistent programs which are set to launch upon boot. Since most viruses inject themselves to launch the 
moment your computer starts, this program may identify threats which were missed by the previous program if 
they were not running at the time. After opening this application, click the scan button and allow the process to 
complete. You will receive a notification about any suspicious files. I execute this weekly along with Task 
Explorer. Please note that it also only notifies you of issues, and does not remove them.
Task Explorer (objective-see.com/products/taskexplorer.html): This free Mac-only application is simple yet 
effective. It identifies all running processes and queries them through a service called Virus Total. If it finds a 
suspicious file, it alerts you with a red flag in the lower-right corner. Clicking the flag allows you to see more 
details about the potential threat. I execute this program weekly from any Mac machine 1 am using. If you have 
picked up a virus on your host, this program should identify it quickly. However, it does not remove any 
infections. For that, you will need to research any suspicious files.
ClamAV (clamav.net): ClamAV (not to be confused with the unnecessary paid option of ClamXAV) is a 
community-driven and open-source antivirus database, which is freely available to anyone. It usually does not 
score very high on "Top 10 Antivirus" websites, which are commonly paid advertisements. However, it is 
completely free; does not run on your system non-stop; only executes when you desire; and can be completely 
removed easily. Unfortunately, there is no easy software installation process, and no point-and-click application. 
You will need to manually update the database through a Terminal command, then scan your system from the 
same prompt. ClamAV does not remove any viruses by default, it only discloses the presence and location of 
suspicious files. In my use, ClamAV has never found a virus which impacted a Mac computer. Instead, it has 
identified numerous malicious files which target Windows machines, but were present on my system (mostly as 
email attachments). This notification allowed me to manually remove those files, which could prevent tuture 
infection of my Windows virtual machines. If you have concerns about having a "naked" Mac with no antivirus, 
the following instructions will configure your Mac to be better protected.
Mac users do not have any built-in antivirus protection, and most do not need any. The software architecture 
of Mac computers is much more secure, and viruses are rare (but they do still occur). 1 no longer recommend 
the free commercial products such as Avast, Kaspersky, and others. They tend to be more of an annoyance than 
helpful, and their business practices can be questionable. However, I do believe that it is irresponsible to have 
absolutely no protection whatsoever. I was once asked during testimony of a federal trial to disclose any security 
software present within my investigation computers. I was glad my response was not "none". This would have 
likely introduced a defense blaming an infected workspace. I was proud to disclose my open-source solutions. 
When I conduct investigations from a Mac computer, I always possess three software applications which can be 
executed at any time without any of them running full-time in the background of my operating system.

On a weekly basis, launch the program, update the database, and conduct a full scan.

Malwarcbytes will remove any issues it finds.
These steps will install ClamAV; switch to the installation directory; make a copy of the configuration file; and 
then modify the configuration file to allow ClamAV to function. You are now ready to update your antivirus 
database and conduct a scan. Type the following commands into Terminal, striking return on J 
after each line.
I confess I do not execute ClamAV often. A full scan can take hours and is unlikely' to locate threats nor found 
by the previous two applications. However, Task Explorer and KnockKnock do not protect against malicious 
applications which target Windows environments. ClamAV may' find files which are malicious even if they' are 
not a direct threat to your Mac computer. If you conduct government investigations, especially' those which may' 
result in prosecution, I believe yrou have an obligation to possess and execute some type of traditional antivirus 
software. ClamAV is a safe and reliable option. If I were still investigating federal crimes, I would conduct a 
complete scan of my Mac computer weekly.
The use of ClamAV on Mac and Linux computers is more about preventing the spread of bad files to Windows 
users instead of protecting your own machine, but viruses do exist for non-Windows systems. Whether on 
Windows or Mac computers, protection from malicious software, otherwise known as malware, is vital. Again, 
there are numerous free options from which to choose. I recommend Malwarcbytes for some Windows and 
Apple users who desire additional protection, but I do not use it on my Mac. If I were a Windows user, it would 
be mandatory on my machine. I suggest executing, updating, and scanning at least once a week on every 
Windows device you use.
The first option will download all virus definition updates, and should be executed before each scan. The second 
option conducts a scan of the entire computer, and will only prompt you with details of found viruses. While it 
may appear to be dormant, it is working, and will notify you upon completion. AU of these commands must be 
exact In order to assist with this, I have created a web page with all of these commands at 
https://inteltechniques.com/clamav.
freshclam -v 
clamscan -r -i /
ClamAV may’ occasionally present a false-positive report of a virus. Do not panic. Research the file on the 
internet and identify the issues. If you receive reports of malicious files within email, simply' delete those 
messages. Note that the above scans only SEARCH for viruses, they do not REMOVE threats. If yrou would 
like to conduct a scan and automatically remove suspicious files, you must conduct a different command. Please 
note this could be dangerous, and could permanently remove necessary files. I always run a scan, research the 
threats found, and execute the foUowing scan ONLY if 1 am confident the files should be removed.
Virtual Private Network (VPN)
ising a connection from your internet
Computer Optimization

If you work for a large corporation, you may already have access to a corporate VPN. Ask around and identify 
your options. These are great for security, but not so much for privacy. I never recommend a corporate \TN 
for online investigations. Instead, you need to purchase a VPN sendee. While there are a few providers that give 
awayr free VPNs, I never recommend them. They are extremely slow and often use your internet connection for 
other people’s traffic. Instead, consider purchasing access from a reputable provider such as ProtonXTN or 
P1A. I explain the benefits of each at https://inteltechniques.com/vpn.html.
If prompted, decline any premium features or trials. The free version is sufficient and preferred. Proper antivirus 
and antimalware protection will greatly enhance your overall computing experience. It will help your computer 
to run smoothly and may prevent malicious files from infecting your operating system. It will help protect the 
integrity of any online investigations. 1 refer to these steps as the "staples". They are the minimum requirements 
before proceeding and apply to any computer user. Ideally, you will newer use your host operating system for 
any web browsing or investigations, and all of this will be overkill. However, it is better to be safe than sorry’. 
Always consider the integrity of your investigations.
VPNs can be launched in many ways. Some run through a firewall or router, which may be overkill for your 
needs. This is especially true if you conduct investigations from a laptop at multiple locations. Some use various 
web browser extensions which allow the VPN to intercept data. I do not recommend this as it would only 
protect your browser traffic instead of your entire host. My advice for you is to protect your entire host computer 
with a dedicated VPN application. This will also protect your virtual machines, which will be explained in the 
next chapter.
If you are on your home computer, and connected to the internet, you are us 
service provider (ISP). If you navigate to a website that is monitoring visitors, it knows your IP address, 
approximate location, and internet provider and type (cable, DSL, etc.). However, if you are on that same 
computer, with the same internet connection, you can use a VPN to protect you. The VPN software connects 
your computer to one of their servers over the internet connection. This encrypted traffic cannot be deciphered 
by the ISP. When your traffic gets to the VPN server, it sends and receives your data, returning incoming packets 
to you. The websites that you visit believe that you have the IP address of the VPN server. They do not kno\ 
what type of internet connection you possess nor your location.
Both ProtonVPN and PIA provide a software application to all premium user accounts. I find this sufficient for 
our needs and installation is easy for both Windows and Mac. Each of these providers allow you to connect to 
your choice of dozens of servers worldwide. 1 can choose California when I want to appear on the west coast 
or New York when I want to appear in die east. I can choose London in order to bypass restrictions while 
watching the BBC online or Toronto when 1 need to appear as a Canadian user. Your yearly access can be used 
on up to ten devices simultaneously. My personal policy on VPNs is quite simple. 1 always use a VPN on any 
device that I connect to the internet. This includes desktops, laptops, and cell phones.
Some readers may wonder why they cannot simply use the free Tor service for this scenario. While you could, 
it is not usually advised. Tor connections can be too slow for constant use. Also, some websites will not let you 
access their services through a Tor proxy. Connecting to your bank through Tor will likely set off alarms, and 
may prevent you from access. Visiting social networks through Tor can also be an issue. I believe that Tor is 
great when you truly need to hide your entire connection, and I will discuss more on that later. I believe that 
every' day’ browsing is better suited for a VPN.
I believe that every’ OSINT researcher should possess and use a virtual private network (VPN) at all times. A 
VPN extends a private network across a public network, such as the internet. It enables users to send and receive 
data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private 
network, thus benefiting from the functionality and security of the private network. z\ VPN masks your identity 
online. Two specific examples should help demonstrate the need for this resource.

KeePassXC is an open-source password manager that does not synchronize content to the internet. There are 
many convenient online password managers which are secure and keep all of your devices ready for automated 
logins. Those are great for personal security, and millions of people are safely using them. Flowever, it is not 
enough for our needs. Since you will be storing data connected to online investigations, you should protect it in 
an offline solution. KeePassXC is cross-platform and free. It will work identically on Mac, Windows, or Linux. 
Download the software from https://keepassxc.org, and conduct the following as an exercise.
While you conduct your online investigations, you wall likely create and maintain numerous accounts and profiles 
across various sendees. Documenting the profile details, including passwords, for these sendees can be a
