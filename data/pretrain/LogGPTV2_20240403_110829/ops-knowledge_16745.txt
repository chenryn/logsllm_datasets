Advantages: - Users can focus on application development without worrying about infrastructure maintenance and management; - PaaS provides many development tools and services, which can greatly shorten the development cycle; - PaaS can provide high availability such as automatic expansion and load balancing The service makes the application more reliable and stable. Disadvantages: - The degree of customization of PaaS services is low, and users cannot customize the underlying infrastructure; - PaaS services generally require professional knowledge, and users need to undergo corresponding training and learning to use them; Procedures are monitored and audited. 3.
