### Title: Anatomy of Native IIS Malware at Black Hat US 2021

**Abstract:**

Internet Information Services (IIS) is Microsoft's web server software for Windows, featuring an extensible and modular architecture. Threat actors have exploited this extensibility to intercept or modify network traffic, with the first reported instances of IIS malware targeting payment information from e-commerce sites dating back to 2013. By 2021, IIS backdoors were being deployed through the Microsoft Exchange pre-authentication RCE vulnerability chain, with government institutions among the targets. Given that Exchange email servers often implement Outlook Web Access (OWA) via IIS, they are particularly attractive targets for IIS malware.

Despite the significant threat posed by IIS malware, especially to servers without security products, there has been a lack of comprehensive guidance on its detection, analysis, mitigation, and remediation. This session aims to fill that gap by systematically documenting the current landscape of IIS malware, with a focus on native IIS modules implemented as C++ libraries.

Based on our analysis of 14 malware families—10 of which are newly reported—we will break down the anatomy of native IIS malware, extract its common features, and document real-world cases. Our findings are supported by a full-internet scan for compromised servers.

We will cover the essentials of reverse-engineering native IIS malware, including:
- Dissecting its architecture
- Understanding module classes and the `RegisterModule` entry-point
- Exploring request-processing pipeline hooks and malicious event handlers
- Discussing the parsing and processing of HTTP requests
- Examining how responses are modified and logs are cleared

Our discussion will not be limited to any single threat actor, malware family, or campaign but will instead encompass the entire class of IIS threats, ranging from traffic redirectors to backdoors. We will also explore curious schemes where compromised servers are misused to boost third-party SEO and how IIS proxies can turn servers into part of the Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure.

The session will conclude with a live demo showcasing the interactions between a compromised server and an attacker, along with practical steps that defenders can take using IIS server tools to identify and remediate a successful compromise.

**Key Takeaways:**
- A comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of IIS malware.
- Techniques for reverse-engineering and analyzing native IIS malware.
- Real-world case studies and examples of IIS malware in action.
- Practical steps for identifying and remediating IIS malware compromises.
