User: How to design a highly available database architecture? Please provide a scheme for master-slave replication.
Assistant: The following key points need to be considered in designing a highly available database architecture: 1. Fault tolerance: When the main database fails, the standby database can automatically take over the service. 2. Availability: When the main database fails, the standby database can quickly provide services without data loss. 3. Performance: The impact of master-slave replication on performance should be minimized. 4. Scalability: The architecture should allow for fault tolerance and availability by adding more standby databases. A high-availability architecture of master-slave replication is: 1. Deploy the master library on an independent server and enable binary logs. 2. Deploy the standby database on another server, and synchronize data regularly by configuring the replication relationship. 3. For the standby database, the master-slave link monitoring of master-slave replication should be enabled. When the master-slave connection is disconnected, the standby database will automatically switch to the master database mode to provide services. 4. When the main database returns to normal, the standby database will switch to the slave database mode again, and data synchronization will be performed by copying log data. 5. Realize load balancing at the architectural level, and distribute service requests to the main library and standby library through the load balancer. 6. When the main library fails, the service of the main library should be stopped as soon as possible, and the standby library can take over the service to ensure the availability of the service. 7. The use of replica sets in the architecture allows more standby databases to be added during runtime, further improving fault tolerance and availability. 8. Make regular backups for quick recovery in case of data loss. In short, a highly available database architecture requires comprehensive consideration of fault tolerance, availability, performance, scalability, etc., and the flexible use of various technical means to build a truly reliable, efficient, and scalable database architecture.
