# Query Structure and Semantic Privacy Evaluation

## Figure 2: Empirical CDF of the Target User’s Query Structure Privacy

The empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) in Figure 2 illustrates the query structure privacy of the target user. The normalized false positive and false negative errors indicate the extent to which the reconstructed clusters by the attacker differ from the user's actual clusters.

- **Query Structure Privacy - False Positive**: This metric reflects the probability that the obfuscation mechanism incorrectly identifies a non-user query as a user query.
- **Query Structure Privacy - False Negative**: This metric reflects the probability that the obfuscation mechanism fails to identify a user query as such.

### Relative Privacy Evaluation
The right part of Figure 2 shows the relative privacy after removing the inherent randomness of the user. TMN (TrackMeNot) offers better relative privacy compared to USR (User-Specific Randomness). The gap between TMN and USR increases as the fraction of users covered grows, indicating the superior effectiveness of TMN regardless of the user's behavior.

## Figure 3: Empirical CDF of the Target Users’ Semantic Privacy

Figure 3 depicts the semantic privacy of the users, computed as the cosine distance between the semantic profile of the target user (SU) and the profiles of the two clusters (S1 and S2) obtained from the clustering attack on SO (the obfuscated search log).

- **Semantic Privacy - Average Case**: The average privacy level is calculated by taking the mean of the privacy with respect to both clusters.
- **Semantic Privacy - Worst Case**: The worst-case privacy is determined by taking the minimum privacy value from the two clusters.

### Observations
- TMN provides better overall privacy compared to USR.
- In the average case, USR offers better privacy for about 90% of the users, highlighting the impact of user-specific background knowledge on privacy.
- If the adversary has access to the user's history (HU), they can more easily identify the cluster associated with the user, thus breaking their privacy.

### Hybrid Obfuscation Techniques
USR-based obfuscation uses fake queries sampled from real users, while TMN-based obfuscation generates queries in an automated fashion. TMN offers better privacy across different metrics due to the lack of temporal and semantic correlation between the generated queries.

A hybrid TMN-USR obfuscation scheme could:
1. Sample queries from another real user.
2. Inject these queries and simulate click behavior in an automated manner, similar to TMN.
This approach would break the overall correlation between the fake queries, making it harder to distinguish them from the user's real queries.

## Related Work

Several user-centric web search query obfuscation methods have been proposed:

- **TrackMeNot (TMN)**: A Firefox plugin that issues dummy queries from predefined RSS feeds at random intervals.
- **GooPIR**: A standalone application that extends real user queries with dummy terms and re-ranks the results locally.
- **PRivAcy model for the Web (PRAW)**: Builds an internal user profile and issues queries close to the user's interests.
- **Plausibly Deniable Search (PDS)**: Provides k-anonymity and ensures subsequent search queries are related.
- **Optimized Query Forgery for Private Information Retrieval (OQF-PIR)**: Achieves perfect user profile obfuscation by matching the user profile to the average population profile.
- **Noise Injection for Search Privacy Protection (NISPP)**: Finds the optimal dummy query distribution using mutual information as a metric.

### Challenges in Comparing Obfuscation Mechanisms
- There is no common quantitative framework or privacy metric for comparing different obfuscation mechanisms.
- Some solutions use information-theoretic metrics, while others do not employ any specific metric.
- Few evaluations provide a comprehensive comparison of the effectiveness of these methods.

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each method, we can design more effective and robust obfuscation techniques to protect user privacy in web search.
