## Abstract

This paper investigates the problem of acoustic emanations from dot-matrix printers. We present a novel attack that can reconstruct printed English text based on the sound emitted by the printer, provided the microphone is placed close enough to the device. In our experiments, the attack successfully recovers up to 72% of printed words, and up to 95% with contextual knowledge, using a microphone positioned 10 cm from the printer. After an initial training phase, the attack is fully automated, leveraging a combination of machine learning, audio processing, and speech recognition techniques, including spectral features, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and linear classification. The system also supports feedback-based incremental learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of various countermeasures and describe a successful in-field deployment in a doctor's practice, where we recovered the content of medical prescriptions with appropriate privacy protections.

## 1. Introduction

Information leakage through emanations from electronic devices has been a long-standing concern. The first publicly known attack, published in 1985, reconstructed monitor content from its electromagnetic emanations [36]. Military organizations had prior knowledge of similar techniques [41, 20]. Related attacks captured monitor content from cable emanations [21] and exploited acoustic emanations from keyboards to reveal key presses [3, 42, 7]. This work focuses on the acoustic emanations of dot-matrix printers.

### 1.1 Dot-Matrix Printers: Still Relevant?

Although outdated for personal use, dot-matrix printers remain prevalent in businesses handling confidential information. We conducted a representative survey in Germany, revealing the following key findings (see Figure 1 for additional details):

- **Medical Practices:**
  - Approximately 60% of German doctors use dot-matrix printers, primarily for printing health records and medical prescriptions.
  - This corresponds to about 190,000 doctors, with an average of over 2.4 million records and prescriptions printed daily.
  - Only about 5% of these doctors plan to replace their dot-matrix printers, citing reasons such as robustness, low cost, and compatibility issues with older hardware.

- **Banks:**
  - About 30% of German banks use dot-matrix printers for account statements and transaction transcripts.
  - This equates to 14,000 bank branches, with more than 1.2 million documents printed daily.
  - Only about 8% of these banks plan to replace their dot-matrix printers.

- **Legal Requirements:**
  - Several European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, mandate the use of dot-matrix (carbon-copy) printers for printing prescriptions of narcotic substances [8].

### 1.2 Our Contributions

We demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct printed English text from a recording of the sound emitted by a dot-matrix printer. The fundamental principle is that the sound intensity increases with the number of needles striking the paper simultaneously (see Figure 2). Our approach involves:

1. **Feature Design:**
   - We develop a feature extraction method tailored for printer sounds, which differ from human auditory perception. Our experiments show that most relevant features occur above 20 kHz, and a logarithmic scale is not suitable. We use sub-band decomposition with emphasis on high frequencies and linearly spaced filter frequencies.

2. **Word-Based Approach:**
   - To address the blurring effect of sound over adjacent letters, we adopt a word-based approach rather than decoding individual letters. This requires an extended training phase but yields better results, especially with contextual knowledge.

3. **Speech Recognition Techniques:**
   - We employ HMMs to increase recognition rates by leveraging statistical frequency of word sequences in English text. This helps in ruling out incorrect word combinations and improves overall accuracy.

Our prototype achieves recognition rates of up to 72% for general English text and up to 95% with domain-specific corpora. We have also identified and evaluated simple countermeasures, such as acoustic shielding and increasing the distance between the microphone and the printer, which are effective in most practical scenarios.

## 2. Attack Overview

In this section, we provide a high-level description of our attack without delving into technical details. The scenario involves printing potentially sensitive English text on a dot-matrix printer and recording the emitted sound. Our methodology automatically reconstructs the printed text from the recording. Figure 4 provides a holistic overview of the attack.

### 2.1 Training Phase (Figure 4(a))

The training phase, which can be conducted before or after the attack, involves printing a sequence of words from a dictionary and extracting characteristic sound features for each word. These features are stored in a database. The main steps include:

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - We use a novel feature design that borrows from techniques used in speech recognition and music processing. Unlike these domains, our experiments show that relevant features for printer sounds occur above 20 kHz, and a logarithmic scale is not appropriate. We split the recording into single words based on the intensity of the frequency band between 20 kHz and 48 kHz, and use linearly spaced filter frequencies.

2. **Noise Reduction:**
   - We apply noise reduction techniques to make the recognition robust against measurement variations and environmental noise.

3. **Language Model Computation:**
   - If HMM-based post-processing is used, a corpus of suitable text documents is required to build the underlying language model.

### 2.2 Recognition Phase (Figure 4(b))

The recognition phase involves analyzing the recorded sound of the unknown text and matching it against the trained features. The main steps include:

1. **Acoustic Feature Extraction:**
   - The recording is split into words, and raw spectrum features are computed.

2. **Noise Reduction:**
   - Noise reduction techniques are applied to the extracted features.

3. **Candidate Word Selection:**
   - The system selects candidate words based on the extracted features.

4. **HMM-Based Reordering:**
   - HMMs are used to reorder the candidate words, leveraging the statistical frequency of word sequences to improve accuracy.

5. **Recovered Text:**
   - The final output is the reconstructed text.
