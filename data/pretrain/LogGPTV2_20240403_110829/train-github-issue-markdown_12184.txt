I am working with an API which returns an empty response body on http status
200 (OK) & a body which is populated on http status 400 (Bad Request).
When using RestTemplate.getForEntity() this is fine for the case where the
body is populated, however I get an exception for the 'null body' case.
My understanding is one should provide a class implementing the ResponseBody
interface & make the call via the execute() method on the RestTemplate.
This task is a request to consider that the use case here is common & whether
Spring should offer something out of the box for this situation.
