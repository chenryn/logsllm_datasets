User: Please explain the application scenarios of virtualization technology and list several virtualization technologies.
Assistant: Application scenarios of virtualization technology: 1. Server virtualization: run multiple virtual machines on one physical server to improve server utilization and save hardware costs. 2. Desktop virtualization: Virtualize desktop systems and applications, and users can access virtual desktops on any computer to improve work efficiency. 3. Network virtualization: Divide the physical network into multiple logical networks, so that multiple tenants can share the same physical network and improve network utilization. 4. Storage virtualization: Virtualize multiple physical storage devices into a logical storage pool, allowing users to store data on any physical storage device. 5. Application virtualization: Virtualize applications into independent containers so that applications can run on any operating system and hardware. Types of virtualization technologies: 1. Operating system-level virtualization: Use containers or process isolation to isolate different applications or services. 2. Virtual machine technology: virtualize a physical computer into multiple virtual machines, each of which can independently run an operating system and multiple applications. 3. Hardware virtualization: use the virtualization layer to abstract the hardware resources of the physical computer into virtualized resources, and the virtual machine can run operating systems and applications on the virtual hardware. 4. Network virtualization: Virtualize a physical network into multiple logical networks, and each logical network can run its own network protocol and security mechanism independently.
