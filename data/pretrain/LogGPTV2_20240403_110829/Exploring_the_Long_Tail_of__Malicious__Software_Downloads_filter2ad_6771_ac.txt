### Exploring the Long Tail of (Malicious) Software Downloads

#### 4.3. File Signers and Packers

The use of static analysis on downloaded files can, in some cases, provide valuable information about their true nature. In this section, we investigate whether downloaded software is typically signed and by whom. Additionally, we analyze which files are packed and with what packing software. The information on software signatures and packer identification was obtained from both VirusTotal.com and AMV’s internal software analysis infrastructure.

**Table 6: Percentage of Signed Benign, Unknown, and Malicious Files**

| Type         | # of Files | Signed % | From Browsers % |
|--------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Trojan       | 22,413     | 59.9%    | 81.3%           |
| Dropper      | 43,423     | 85.6%    | 95.4%           |
| Ransomware   | 563        | 44.4%    | 68.7%           |
| Bot          | 1,092      | 1.5%     | 2.2%            |
| Worm         | 201        | 5.5%     | 12.3%           |
| Spyware      | 80         | 21.2%    | 25.0%           |
| Banker       | 1,719      | 1.2%     | 1.8%            |
| FakeAV       | 987        | 2.8%     | 4.5%            |
| Adware       | 29,345     | 43.1%    | 91.8%           |
| PUP          | 31,018     | 76.0%    | 79.6%           |
| Undefined    | 60,609     | 65.1%    | 71.3%           |
| Benign       | 43,601     | 30.7%    | 32.1%           |
| Unknown      | 1,626,901  | 38.4%    | 42.1%           |
| Malicious    | 191,450    | 66.0%    | 81.0%           |

**Observations:**
- Some malicious file types, such as droppers and PUPs, tend to carry a valid software signature, while others, such as bots and bankers, are rarely signed.
- This might be because malware types like droppers and PUPs are usually the initiators of infections and are often directly downloaded via a web browser with user consent (e.g., via social engineering attacks).
- Signing these malicious files may be a way to persuade users about their legitimacy and perhaps also to thwart AV detection.
- A row-by-row comparison reveals that malicious files that are directly downloaded by browsers are more likely to be signed. This is also true for benign and unknown files.
- The percentage of signed malicious files is much higher than signed benign software, indicating that malware distributors try hard to trick users into running their software and evade AV detection.

**Figure 4: Common Signers Between Malicious and Benign Files**

- The figure includes a count of malicious/benign files signed by each signer.
- Among the interesting results are malicious files that are signed by seemingly reputable signers such as AVG Technologies and BitTorrent, which further manual analysis revealed to be mostly PUPs.

**Conclusion:**
- File signer information can be utilized to gain more insight into the true nature of completely unknown files.
- In Section 6, we present a system that uses signers data (alongside other information) to label unknown files.
