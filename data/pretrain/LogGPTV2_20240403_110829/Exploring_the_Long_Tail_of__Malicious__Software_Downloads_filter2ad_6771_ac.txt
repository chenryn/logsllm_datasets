Table 5. Popular download domains per type of malicious file
4.3. File Signers and Packers
The use of a simple static analysis of the downloaded files can, in some cases, provide valuable information 
about their true nature. In this section, we explore if downloaded software is typically signed and by what 
signers4. Furthermore, we analyze what files are packed, and with what packing software. The information 
about software signatures and packer identification have been obtained from both VirusTotal.com as well 
as from AMV’s internal software analysis infrastructure.
Table  6  reports  the  percentage  of  signed  benign, unknown,  and  malicious  files.  According  to  Table  6, 
some malicious file types, such as dropper and pup, tend to carry a valid software signature, while some 
others, such as bot and banker, are rarely signed. This might be because malware types such as dropper 
and pup are usually the initiators of infections and are often directly downloaded via a web browser with 
user consent (e.g., via social engineering attacks). Signing these malicious files may be a way to persuade 
the users about their legitimacy, and perhaps also to thwart AV detection. To verify this intuition, the “From 
Browsers” column reports the percentage of signed files that are downloaded via popular web browsers. 
A row by row comparison reveals that malicious files that are directly downloaded by browsers are more 
likely to be signed. This is also true for benign and unknown files. 
Another interesting observation is the percentage of signed malicious files is much higher than signed 
benign software. This again may be due to the fact that malware distributors try hard to trick users into 
running their software and evade AV detection.

17 | Exploring the Long Tail of (Malicious) Software Downloads
Table 7 shows the number of unique signers that signed different types of malicious files. We also compare 
the signers of different types of malicious files with benign files. The “In common with benign” column 
shows  the  number  of  common  signers  between  malicious  and  benign  files.  For  example,  out  of  248 
signers that signed different droppers, 46 also signed some benign files and consequently 202 exclusively 
signed malicious files only. We further provide examples of these signers in Table 8. The “Top Signers” 
column lists the names of the top 3 signers for each type of file. For different types of malware, the table 
reports the top 3 signers that are in common with benign files as well as top 3 signers that exclusively 
signed  malware  files.  Similar  information  is  also  provided  for  benign  files.  One  interesting  case  is  the 
droppers’ top signer being “Softonic International,” which shows that some popular software download 
websites may distribute bundled applications that include malicious software. Table 8 also shows some of 
the top signers that exclusively signed either malware or benign files, as well as the number of files signed 
by each signer. Note that file signer information could be utilized to gain more insight into the true nature 
of completely unknown files. In Section 6, we present a system that uses signers data (alongside other 
information) to label unknown files.
Figure 4 provides a detailed view of the common signers of malicious and benign files. The figure includes 
a count of malicious/benign files signed by each signer. Among the interesting results are malicious files 
that are signed by seemingly reputable signers such as AVG Technologies and BitTorrent, which further 
manual analysis revealed to be mostly PUPs.
