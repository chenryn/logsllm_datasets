### Title: The Cyber Shell Game – War, Information Warfare, and the Darkening Web

This year marks a dubious anniversary: it has been 20 years since the first major resolution on "information security" was submitted to the United Nations. This resolution was the first of many, but it is not the kind of "information security" you might expect. Instead of focusing on standards like ISO2700x and data protection, this version of information security is primarily concerned with content. It is less about a hyper-kinetic "cyber war" that targets critical infrastructure and more about "information warfare" and regime change.

For many foreign governments, the current free and open Internet is seen as the biggest threat to their own security. They envision a different Internet—one that is top-down, intergovernmental, and framed around security. Despite the best efforts of the United States and its allies, there is often a pull towards new legislation and an intergovernmental-dominated Internet system.

This clash of values is also a clash of visions and strategic games. The free Internet is increasingly becoming the subject of a shell game, where sleights-of-hand and information warfare masquerade as cyber espionage and preparation for all-out war. This talk will explore the ideological differences in cyber conflict and how these have been operationally reflected in both major cyber campaigns and international diplomacy. It will trace the forces that threaten to fundamentally shift the Internet from a tool for enabling freedoms to one of security and control. Finally, it will address how the Internet can be saved from external threats and from itself.
