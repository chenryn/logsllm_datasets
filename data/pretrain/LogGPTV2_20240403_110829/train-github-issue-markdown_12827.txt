# Why Mypy re-enable
For a few weeks MyPy checks have been disabled after the switch to Python 3.7
(per #19317).
We should, however, re-enable it back as it is very useful in catching a
number of mistakes.
# How does it work
We 've re-added the mypy pre-commit now - with mypy bumped to 0.910. This
version detects far more errors and we should fix them all before we switch
the CI check back.
  * mypy will be running for incremental changes in pre-commit, same as before. This will enable incremental fixes of the code changed by committers who use pre-commits locally
  * mypy on CI runs in non-failing mode. When the main pre-commit check is run, mypy is disabled, but then it is run as a separate step (which does not fail but will show the result of running mypy on all our code). This will enable us to track the progress of fixes
# Can I help with the effort, you ask?
We started concerted effort now and incrementally fix all the mypy
incompatibilities - ideally package/by/package to avoid huge code reviews.
We'd really appreciate a number of people to contribute, so that we can re-
enable mypy back fully and quickly :).
# How can I help?
What you need is:
  * checkout `main`
  * `./breeeze build-image`
  * `pip install pre-commit`
  * `pre-commit install`
This will enable automated checks for when you do a regular contribution. When
you make your change, any MyPy issues will be reporteed and you need to fix
them all to commit. You can also commit with `--no-verify` flag to skip that,
bu, well, if you can improve airlfow a little - why not?
# How can I help more ?
You can add PRs that are fixing whole packages, without contributing features
or bugfixes. Please refer to this issue #19891 and ideally comment below in
the issue that you want to take care of a package (to avoid duplicate work).
An easy way to run MyPy check for package can be done either from the host:
    find DIRECTORY -name "*.py" | xargs pre-commit run mypy --files
or from ./breeze shell:
    mypy --namespace-packages DIRECTORY

# Remaining packages
Here is the list of remaining packages to be "mypy compliant" generated with:
    pre-commit run mypy --all-files 2>&1 | sed -r "s/\x1B\[([0-9]{1,2}(;[0-9]{1,2})?)?[mGK]//g" | grep "error:" | sort | awk 'FS=":" { print $1 }' | xargs dirname | sort | uniq -c | xargs -n 2 printf "* [ ] (%4d) %s\n"
