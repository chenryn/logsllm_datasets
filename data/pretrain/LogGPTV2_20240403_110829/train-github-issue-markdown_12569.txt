## Bug report
The PDF logo doesn't look quite right, viewed in Adobe Acrobat, Preview, and
Google Chrome (on macOS). If you look closely at the center, there are some
extra features there that don't show up in, for instance, the svg.

data/images/matplotlib.pdf
Maybe somebody should track down why the render of the PDF glitched? At least
replace it with one that isn't glitchy?
