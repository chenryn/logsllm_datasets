User:  Given a directory's path, how do I find the largest file in it using Linux command line tools?
Assistant: The largest file in a directory can be found with: ``` find /path/to/directory -type f -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -nr | head -1 ``` Explanation: - `find /path/to/directory` : Find all files in the specified directory - `-type f` : Find files only, exclude directories and other special types - `-printf '%s %p\n'` : Print every file The size and path, separated by spaces - `sort -nr`: Sort by file size, from largest to smallest - `head -1`: Only output the size and path of the largest file. Note: `/path/to/directory` in the above command needs to be replaced with the actual directory path.
