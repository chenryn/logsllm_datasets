**ATT&CK ID:** T1461  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Lockscreen Bypass

An adversary with physical access to a mobile device may attempt to bypass the device's lockscreen. There are several methods that can be used to achieve this, including:

- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Adversaries may leverage known vulnerabilities in the deviceâ€™s operating system or lockscreen software to gain unauthorized access.
- **Brute Force Attacks:** Repeatedly attempting to guess the passcode or pattern until the correct one is found.
- **Social Engineering:** Tricking the device owner into revealing their passcode or using biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition) on behalf of the adversary.
- **Physical Tampering:** Disassembling the device to access and manipulate internal components, such as the memory or storage, to bypass the lockscreen.
- **Using Specialized Tools:** Employing hardware or software tools designed to exploit specific weaknesses in the lockscreen mechanism.

Understanding these methods can help in implementing more robust security measures to protect against lockscreen bypass attempts.
