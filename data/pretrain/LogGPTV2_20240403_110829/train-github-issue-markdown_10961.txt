##### Description of the problem
Hi there. This is the error message:
> [.CommandBufferContext]RENDER WARNING: there is no texture bound to the unit
> 1
I try to ignore these warnings, but sometimes (more than 50% time in my 3D
Game) it will stop loading textures. It drove me crazy for a whole day and
finally found it was caused by the latest Chrome update [Version 50.0.2661.75
m]. (Chrome was updated from [Version 49.0.2623.110 m])
This is my test code for the issue:  
test link for [r75]  
test link for [dev]
It is a simple environment to reproduce the issue. It looks fine in this
example, but if the scene is complex enough, some textures will be missing.
