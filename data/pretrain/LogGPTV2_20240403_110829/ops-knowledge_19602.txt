User: In my Ubuntu 12.04 machine, the installation of pip requirements is asking me for sudo permission every time it attempts to install. How would I override this, as this is terrible for my working environment to install things globally instead of inside the venv?
Note: I did not setup the venv using sudo.
Assistant: Make sure you use a recent version of virtualenv itself, the latest at the time of writing is 1.7.2. Old versions required the use of -E switch, to install into the virtual environment.
