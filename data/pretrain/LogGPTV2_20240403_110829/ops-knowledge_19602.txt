**User:** On my Ubuntu 12.04 machine, every time I try to install pip requirements, it asks for `sudo` permissions. This is problematic for my working environment, as I prefer to install packages within a virtual environment (venv) rather than globally. Note that I did not set up the venv using `sudo`.

**Assistant:**

To avoid needing `sudo` permissions when installing packages with `pip` inside a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure You Are Using a Recent Version of `virtualenv`:**
   - The version of `virtualenv` you are using can affect how it handles package installations. As of the latest update, `virtualenv` 1.7.2 or later is recommended. Older versions may require the `-E` switch to ensure that packages are installed in the virtual environment.

2. **Activate Your Virtual Environment:**
   - Before running any `pip` commands, make sure your virtual environment is activated. You can do this by running:
     ```bash
     source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Packages Without `sudo`:**
   - Once the virtual environment is activated, you should be able to install packages without `sudo`:
     ```bash
     pip install <package_name>
     ```

4. **Check for Global Configuration Issues:**
   - If you still encounter issues, check if there are any global configurations in your `pip` setup that might be causing it to look for `sudo` permissions. You can inspect your `pip` configuration files, such as `~/.pip/pip.conf` or `/etc/pip.conf`, to ensure they are not forcing global installations.

5. **Use `--user` Flag (Optional):**
   - If you need to install packages outside of a virtual environment but still want to avoid global installations, you can use the `--user` flag with `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install --user <package_name>
     ```
   - However, this is generally not necessary if you are using a virtual environment correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to install packages within your virtual environment without needing `sudo` permissions.
