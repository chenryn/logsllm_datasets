### Table 6: Guessing Results for Comprehensive-Policy Password Sets

The table below provides the number of passwords in each set (N), the percentage of passwords guessed at various guessing points, and the results of the G1 test comparing the guessing distributions. Rows in bold indicate guessing distributions that are statistically significantly different from CMUactive, with Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.00139; rows that are not significantly different are marked with †. The guessing cutoff is 3.6 E14 for the limited-knowledge attacker and 3.8 E14 for the extensive-knowledge attacker.

### Structural Diversity Measurement

We measure diversity by randomly sampling 1,000 passwords from a dataset, identifying their structures, and counting the number of distinct structures in the sample. This process is repeated 100 times, and the average structure count is used. The choice of 1,000 for sample size is arbitrary, and any reasonable sample size could be used.

### Probability Distributions and Password Strength Metrics

We compare password sets using their probability distributions, an essential component of many password-strength metrics. We use empirical probabilities as observed in each dataset. Since almost all passwords are unique in sets as small as many of our sources, we can only consider the most popular passwords.

For these measurements, we use all conforming passwords from each original dataset, rather than the 1,000-password samples used for consistency in the guessability results.

**Note**: The Structures column gives the number of unique structures found in 1,000 passwords (average of 100 samples). † Because fewer than 1,000 passwords were available for Gcomp8 and SVcomp8, comparable entropy values and structure counts could not be calculated.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

Our findings provide guidance for users, system administrators, and information security personnel, and inform future password research. We find that some elements of the university population create more vulnerable passwords than others. Targeted education on password strength as a community issue may help, especially for users who feel creating strong passwords is not in their interest.

In line with prior work, male users, older users, and those who log in less frequently tend to create slightly stronger passwords, but the effect size is small. Adding digits, symbols, and uppercase letters in predictable places is less effective.

Using personnel databases, server logs, and surveys, we extend our analysis to include user behavior, sentiment, and additional demographic factors. Users who expressed annoyance with CMU’s complex password policy were associated with weaker passwords. Further research into the usability and security implications of password managers as an aid to these users is suggested.

Our analysis centers on passwords created under CMU’s comprehensive password policy. While our results suggest that users who go beyond the minimum requirements have stronger passwords, further work is needed to determine how to improve the policy. Relaxing some requirements and replacing them with others, such as reducing the number of required character classes but requiring longer passwords, or prohibiting special characters at the beginning or end of the password, may be beneficial.

### Figure 7: Simulated Attack Results

Results from a simulated attack from four different attackers, each with different training data, against CMUactive. Public + 3K CMUactive is trained on Public plus 3,000 CMUactive passwords. Public + 3K MTsim is trained on Public plus 3,000 MTsim passwords. The distributions of guess numbers for these two attackers do not differ significantly. Limited-knowledge and extensive-knowledge are discussed in Figure 6.

**Note**: Based on the empirical probability of just the most popular password, CMUactive is the strongest policy, and RYcomp8, Ycomp8, CSDNcomp8, Gcomp8, MTbasic8, and MTdictionary8 are all significantly weaker. Among all sets considered, only the empirical probabilities of MTsim and MTcomp8 are not significantly different from CMUactive for passwords of any rank (Bonferroni-corrected χ2, p < 0.05), though this could be attributed to small sample size. Surprisingly, SFcomp8 is not significantly different from CMUactive at first, but it becomes significantly different when comparing passwords of rank greater than one. In addition, the empirical probabilities of SFcomp8 do not drop off from ranks one to four, unlike every other set. If this is a byproduct of how the set was cracked, this provides further evidence against the use of cracked password sets in research.
