Table 6: Guessing results for comprehensive-policy password sets. The columns provide the number of passwords in the set (N),
the percentage of passwords guessed at various guessing points, and the results of the G1 test comparing the guessing distributions.
Rows in bold have guessing distributions that are statistically signiﬁcantly different from CMUactive, with Bonferroni-corrected
p < 0.00139; rows that are not signiﬁcantly different are marked with †. The guessing cutoff is 3.6 E14 for the limited-knowledge
attacker and 3.8 E14 for the extensive-knowledge attacker.
Figure 6: The percentage of passwords guessed after a given number of guesses (shown in log scale), by password set. The guessability
results on the left are for the limited-knowledge attacker, who has only publicly available data. The guessability results on the right
are for the extensive-knowledge attacker, who has access to some data from the same password sets for training.
LLUDLLS” (U = uppercase, L = lowercase, D = digit, and S =
symbol). We measure diversity by randomly sampling 1,000 pass-
words from a data set, identifying their structures, and counting the
number of distinct structures in the sample; we repeat this sampling
process 100 times and use the average structure count. The choice
of 1,000 for sample size is arbitrary and any reasonable sample size
might be used.
Finally, we compare password sets using their probability dis-
tributions, an essential component of many password-strength met-
rics [3]. We use empirical probabilities as observed in each data set.
We can only consider the most popular passwords, since almost all
passwords are unique in sets as small as many of our sources.
For each of these measurements, we use all conforming pass-
words from each original data set, rather than the 1,000-password
samples that were used for consistency in the guessability results.
Results for length, composition, entropy, and structural diver-
sity are given in Table 7, and a subset are also shown in Figure 8.
For the most part, using these metrics, comprehensive-policy pass-
words more closely resemble each other than passwords from other
policies. As expected, passwords from policies that did not require
them have fewer symbols and uppercase letters.
Perhaps more interesting is to consider how the other password
sets within the comprehensive-policy group relate to CMU pass-
words, which protect high-value accounts. In length and composi-
tion, the passwords from online studies are consistently similar to
the real CMU passwords, while passwords from leaked sets show
more variance, sometimes appearing very similar and other times
very different.
It is particularly interesting to note that although
RYcomp8 appeared very similar to CMUactive in guessability, its
composition features are highly dissimilar, suggesting that it may
not make a good proxy for real high-value passwords.
Self-reported survey responses from comprehensive-policy users
are perhaps surprisingly similar in length and composition to other
comprehensive-policy responses; the small sample size makes it
difﬁcult to ascertain precisely how similar.
Using entropy as a metric, passwords taken from Yahoo! are
most similar to CMU passwords, while RYcomp8 and CSDNcomp8
passwords are most different. In structural diversity MTsim and
MTcomp8 are closest, while Ycomp8 and SFcomp8 are farthest;
perhaps unsurprisingly, the cracked SFcomp8 set shows by far the
least structural diversity of any comprehensive-policy set.

Table 7: Comparing password properties. Shown are mean values with 95% conﬁdence intervals for various password properties.
The Structures column gives the number of unique structures found in 1,000 passwords (average of 100 samples). † Because fewer
than 1,000 passwords were available for Gcomp8 and SVcomp8, comparable entropy values and structure counts could not be
calculated.
take our results into account. Beyond that, we believe our results
provide guidance to users, system administrators, and information
security personnel, as well as informing future password research.
We ﬁnd that some elements of the university population create
more vulnerable passwords than others.
It is possible that some
of these users, such as personnel in the business and arts schools,
would create stronger passwords if they received instruction about
how to do so. On the other hand, if these users are creating weak
passwords because they don’t feel that creating a strong password
is in their interest [22], an education campaign could focus on pass-
word strength as a community issue.
In line with prior work, we ﬁnd that male users, older users, and
users who log in less frequently are correlated with slightly stronger
passwords; however, in each case the effect size is small, and using
different models we ﬁnd that other factors may partially account for
the effects. We also conﬁrm patterns previously held as folk wis-
dom: passwords with more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters
are harder to crack, but adding them in predictable places is less
effective.
Using personnel databases, server logs, and surveys, we extend
our analysis to include user behavior, sentiment, and additional de-
mographic factors. We ﬁnd that users who expressed annoyance
with CMU’s complex password policy were associated with weaker
passwords; again, targeted education about the rationale for the
policy requirements might help. Our ﬁndings also suggest further
research into the usability and security implications of password
managers as an aid to these users.
It is important to note that our analysis centers on passwords cre-
ated under CMU’s comprehensive password policy. While our re-
sults suggest that users who go beyond the minimum requirements
of this policy have stronger passwords, our analysis does not al-
low us to draw conclusions about how the various requirements of
the policy contribute to password strength. Our analysis suggests it
would be useful to ﬁnd policies that would be less annoying to users
and that would discourage users from complying with the policy in
predictable ways. Further work is needed to determine whether
the CMU policy might be improved by relaxing some requirements
and replacing them with others; for example, reducing the number
of required character classes but requiring longer passwords, pro-
hibiting special characters at the beginning or end of the password,
or changing the dictionary check to permit dictionary words with
symbols or digits in the middle.
Our research also provides guidance for future password studies.
For researchers who may have an opportunity to gain limited access
Figure 7: Results from a simulated attack from four dif-
ferent attackers, each with different training data, against
CMUactive. Public + 3K CMUactive is trained on Public plus
3,000 CMUactive passwords. Public + 3K MTsim is trained
on Public plus 3,000 MTsim passwords. The distributions of
guess numbers for these two attackers do not differ signiﬁ-
cantly. limited-knowledge and extensive-knowledge are discussed
in Figure 6.
Results from comparing probability distributions are given in Ta-
ble 8. Based on the empirical probability of just the most popu-
lar password, CMUactive is the strongest policy, and RYcomp8,
Ycomp8, CSDNcomp8, Gcomp8, MTbasic8, and MTdictionary8
are all signiﬁcantly weaker. Among all sets considered, only the
empirical probabilities of MTsim and MTcomp8 are not signiﬁ-
cantly different from CMUactive for passwords of any rank (Bon-
ferroni-corrected χ2, p < 0.05), though this could be attributed
to small sample size. Surprisingly, SFcomp8 is not signiﬁcantly
different from CMUactive at ﬁrst, but it becomes signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent when comparing passwords of rank greater than one. In ad-
dition, the empirical probabilities of SFcomp8 do not drop off from
ranks one to four, unlike every other set. If this is a byproduct of
how the set was cracked, this provides further evidence against the
use of cracked password sets in research.
6. CONCLUSIONS
The CMU information technology division agreed to work with
us on this research in part to gain improved understanding of the
current state of password security at CMU. We expect that future
updates to the university’s password policies and procedures will
