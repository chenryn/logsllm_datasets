**Abstract:**
Page load time (PLT) remains the most common Quality of Service (QoS) metric for estimating the Quality of Experience (QoE) of web users. However, recent literature has proposed alternative metrics, such as Above The Fold (ATF), SpeedIndex, and their variants, to better estimate user QoE. This study aims to thoroughly investigate the relationship between established and recently proposed objective metrics and user QoE. We conducted user experiments to collect and analyze 3,400 web accesses, annotated with QoS metrics and explicit user ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. These data are made available to the community. We compare domain expert models (e.g., ITU-T and IQX) that use a single QoS metric to models trained using our ground-truth dataset with multiple QoS metrics as features. Our results show that, despite their simplicity, expert models have comparable accuracy to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, model accuracy improves significantly when building per-page QoE models, though this may raise scalability concerns, which we discuss.

## 1. Introduction

The web is one of the dominant applications on the internet. Initially designed to deliver static content like text and images, it has evolved to serve highly dynamic and complex content. Modern web pages often include hundreds of objects and dozens of scripts hosted across different servers and domains. To enhance end-user QoE, the web architecture and protocols have also evolved, with the introduction of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and new protocols such as HTTP/2, SPDY, and QUIC.

Measuring the impact of different network and web browsing configurations on web performance is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction. Page Load Time (PLT) has been the most commonly used metric for measuring web browsing performance, both in research and industry. However, recent studies have questioned the relevance of PLT in capturing user experience, as it measures the time at which the page finishes loading but does not account for the entire loading and rendering process. Alternative metrics, such as ATF, SpeedIndex, Object/ByteIndex, and PerceptualSpeedIndex, have been proposed to address this gap.

The current methods for computing metrics like ATF and SpeedIndex involve taking screenshots and post-processing, which is computationally intensive. Our first contribution is to propose a practical method to estimate the ATF metric and provide an open-source implementation as a Chrome extension. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between these objective metrics and subjective user feedback, expressed as Mean Opinion Score (MOS). While models mapping PLT to MOS exist, extensions to leverage new metrics are lacking. We evaluate both expert models (e.g., ITU-T and IQX) and data-driven models learned using machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVR regression, CART trees).

Our second main contribution is a thorough assessment of expert and data-driven models. We find that expert models can accommodate new time-related metrics beyond PLT and have comparable accuracy to data-driven models. However, there is room for improvement, as a single expert model may not be accurate for all types of web pages. Per-page models show superior forecast performance but raise scalability concerns, which we discuss.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1. Web QoS Metrics

Web browsing involves the request, download, and rendering of all objects on a web page, making it challenging to measure when a page has finished loading from the user's perspective. Two classes of objective QoS metrics are discussed:

#### Time Instants
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** Time at which the first byte is received.
- **Time to First Paint (TTFP):** Time at which the first object is painted by the browser.
- **Document Object Model (DOM) Parsing:** Time to parse the DOM.
- **Page Load Time (PLT):** Complete download time, measured using the `onLoad` browser event.
- **VisualComplete:** Rendering of the full page.
- **Above-the-Fold (ATF) Time:** Time at which the visible part of the web page is completely rendered.

Network-related time-instant metrics (e.g., TTFB, DOM, PLT) are easy to measure, while rendering-related metrics (e.g., TTFP, VisualComplete, ATF) are more complex. ATF is particularly challenging, as it requires taking screenshots and post-processing. We propose a practical method to approximate ATF and provide an open-source implementation.

#### Time Integrals
- **SpeedIndex (SI):** Measures visual progress using mean pixel histogram difference until VisualComplete.
- **ObjectIndex (OI) and ByteIndex (BI):** Measure the percentage of objects and bytes downloaded until PLT.
- **PerceptualSpeedIndex (PSI):** Uses Structural Similarity to measure visual progress and cuts the time horizon at either PLT or an earlier time.

The choice of the time horizon (tend) is important. Previous A/B studies suggest using the Time to Click as tend, which improves PSI accuracy. Our experiments show that setting tend with the ATF time is effective, and our method enables measuring it during normal user browsing.

### 2.2. Web QoE Models

While the metrics discussed can be automatically measured from the browser, they may not directly capture user experience (QoE), which is often measured using an opinion score summarized as the MOS. There are two main approaches for mapping QoS metrics into MOS:

- **Expert Models:** Domain experts specify a closed-form function, such as ITU-T and IQX models.
- **Data-Driven Models:** Machine learning algorithms learn the mapping from data, such as SVR regression and CART trees.

In the next sections, we present our method for estimating ATF and our evaluation of expert and data-driven models.
