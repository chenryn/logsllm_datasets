**Description:**
The `tsdiscon` command is used to disconnect a session from a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) server. If no session ID or session name is specified, the command will disconnect the current session.

**Important:**
- You must have either Full Control access permission or Disconnect special access permission to disconnect another user's session.

**Note:**
- For information on new features in the latest version, see [What's New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server](#).

**Syntax:**
```
tsdiscon [SessionID | SessionName] [/server:<ServerName>] [/v] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **SessionID**
  - Specifies the ID of the session to be disconnected.
  
- **SessionName**
  - Specifies the name of the session to be disconnected.
  
- **/server:<ServerName>**
  - Specifies the terminal server that contains the session you want to disconnect. If not specified, the current RDSH server is used. This parameter is required only if you run the `tsdiscon` command from a remote server.
  
- **/v**
  - Displays detailed information about the actions being performed.
  
- **/?**
  - Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- Any applications running when the session is disconnected will continue to run when you reconnect to that session, with no loss of data.
- To end the running applications of a disconnected session, use the `reset session` command. However, this may result in data loss.
- The console session cannot be disconnected.

**Examples:**

- To disconnect the current session:
  ```shell
  tsdiscon
  ```

- To disconnect Session 10:
  ```shell
  tsdiscon 10
  ```

- To disconnect the session named `TERM04`:
