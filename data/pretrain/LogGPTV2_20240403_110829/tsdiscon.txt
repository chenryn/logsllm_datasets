Parameter
Description
Specifies the ID of the session to disconnect.
Specifies the name of the session to disconnect.

Remarks
Any applications running when you disconnected the session are automatically running when you reconnect to that session with no loss of data. You can use the reset session command to end the running applications of the disconnected session, but this may result in loss of data at the session.
The console session can't be disconnected.
