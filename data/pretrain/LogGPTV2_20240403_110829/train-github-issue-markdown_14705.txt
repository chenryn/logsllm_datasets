### System Information
OpenCV version: 4.5.0  
Operating System / Platform: Windows 10  
Compiler & compiler version: GCC 9.3.0
### Detailed description
When trying to save a matrix that has the depth CV_16F using cv::FileStorage
the assertion `depth >=0 && depth <= CV_64F in function 'cv::fs::typeSymbol'`
fails.
* * *
A possible explanation of the error might be found in
`opencv2/core/hal/interface.h`. The order of the different depth definitions
is incorrect and therefore the assertion fails:
    #define CV_8U   0
    #define CV_8S   1
    #define CV_16U  2
    #define CV_16S  3
    #define CV_32S  4
    #define CV_32F  5
    #define CV_64F  6
    #define CV_16F  7
Therefore `CV_64F <= CV_16F` and if `CV_16F = depth` then `depth <= CV_64F` is
`false` and the assertion failed. I did not manage to update opencv to 4.7.0
using vcpkg and therefore I could not verify if the issue still persists
beyond 4.5.0.
### Steps to reproduce
    cv::Mat test = cv::Mat::zeros({100, 100}, CV_16F);
    cv::FileStorage file("test.yml", cv::FileStorage::WRITE);
    file.write("Test Mat", test);
### Issue submission checklist
  * I report the issue, it's not a question
  * I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues, forum.opencv.org, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found any solution
  * I updated to the latest OpenCV version and the issue is still there
  * There is reproducer code and related data files (videos, images, onnx, etc)
