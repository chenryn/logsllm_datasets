### Table 8: Comparison of SODA with Other Related Tools in Detecting Different MITRE ATT&CK Techniques within Malware Execution

SODA (System for Cyber Deception Orchestration and Automation) is designed to detect a wide range of MITRE ATT&CK techniques during malware execution. This table compares SODA with other related tools, highlighting its superior coverage and fine-grained detection capabilities.

### Data Encryption and Service Stop
- **Data Encrypted for Impact**: SODA can detect and mitigate the impact of data encryption by providing deceptive responses.
- **Service Stop**: SODA can intercept and respond to service stop requests, preventing the actual service from being stopped.

### Deception Strategies
#### FakeExecute
- **Description**: In this strategy, SODA performs the malware's action on a remote machine (HoneyFactory) and sends the response back to the attacker.
- **Example**: If the malware runs the `ipconfig` command to get the IP address of the victim machine, SODA intercepts the call, runs the command on the HoneyFactory, and returns the IP address of the remote machine instead.

#### FakeContent
- **Description**: SODA pretends that a file has been opened and its content read, without actually invoking the `ReadFile` call. Instead, it provides static, deceptive content.
- **Example**: If the malware attempts to read the content of a file named "input.txt" with the content "It’s a text file," SODA will return "It’s not a text file" to the attacker.

#### FakeFailure
- **Description**: SODA responds to the malware as if the operation failed, even though the actual WinAPI call was never made.
- **Example**: If the malware calls `CreateProcess` to create a child process, SODA responds that the process creation failed without invoking the actual `CreateProcess` call.

#### FakeSuccess
- **Description**: SODA responds to the malware as if the operation was successful, even though the actual WinAPI call was never made.
- **Example**: If the malware calls `ReadFile` to read the content of a file, SODA responds with a fake success message, providing deceptive content.

#### NativeExecute
- **Description**: SODA allows the malware to run in a controlled environment to discover its current and future actions.
- **Example**: SODA lets the malware execute, but in a contained environment, to observe and analyze its behavior.

### How API Hooking Works
- **Library Used**: EasyHook, a free, open-source hooking library for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows processes, released under the MIT license.
- **Thread Safety**: EasyHook ensures thread safety by using a thread deadlock barrier.
- **Process**: 
  - **Step 1**: EasyHook uses the `CreateRemoteThread` function to create a thread in the target process.
  - **Step 2**: The created thread loads the desired DLL.
  - **Step 3**: Hooks are installed by defining a detouring function for each original WinAPI call to be intercepted.
  - **Step 4**: The detouring functions take control of the malware, allowing for the enforcement of custom code to modify the execution.

### Call Flow with and without API Hooking
- **Without API Hooking (Figure 12A)**: The original API is responsible for performing the task and returning the response.
- **With API Hooking (Figure 12B)**: The call is redirected from the original API to the detour function, where the deception techniques are executed, and the response is sent back to the malware.

### Detection Capabilities
- **Coverage**: SODA has better coverage in detecting MITRE ATT&CK techniques compared to other tools.
- **Fine-Grained Mapping**: SODA can detect detailed MITRE techniques, while other tools typically provide only coarse-grained mappings at the tactics level.
- **Comparison**: For example, other tools may detect Exfiltration and C&C actions at the MITRE tactics level, whereas SODA can detect specific techniques within these tactics, as shown in Table 8.

### Conclusion
SODA offers a comprehensive and detailed approach to detecting and mitigating various MITRE ATT&CK techniques, providing a robust solution for cyber deception and automation.
