7.5 Limbo Signature
We use our protocol to build a Picnic-like post-quantum signa-
ture scheme based on AES using the same methodology as BBQ [21]
and Banquet [3]. More precisely, given a private key k and public
values (𝑥, 𝑦), such that AESk(𝑥) = 𝑦, a signature on a message 𝜇
is generated by binding together 𝜇 with a non-interactive zero-
knowledge proof of knowledge of k.
We compare our resulting signature scheme with Picnic and
Banquet, which are, as far as we know, the fastest MPCitH-based
signature using AES, for security levels L1,L3,L5 as specified by
NIST [37]. In Tables 8, 9 and 10 we show this comparison for dif-
ferent sets of parameters. For all three security levels, Limbo is
not only faster than Banquet in both Prover and Verifier time but
also produces consistently shorter signatures. These are also much
closer to (and sometimes better than) the performance of Picnic
both in running times (for 𝑛 = 16) and in signature size (for 𝑛 = 255).
In Table 7 we compare Limbo as an interactive identification
scheme to the equivalent variant of Picnic. Note that for Picnic,
based on KKW, the number of repetitions indicates both offline and
online repetitions. As before, the communication can be further
reduced using more parties (down to 2.43KB) at the expense of
slightly longer computation time (still under 5ms for both Prover
and Verifier).

A AMORTIZED EVALUATIONS FOR THE
MULTI-INSTANCE CASE
While our MPC and ZK protocols work over fields of any size,
the multiplications check requires large fields to obtain a reasonable
soundness error. So, when the evaluation field F is small, for exam-
ple when F = F2, this step seems to be wasteful. For this reason,
it would be convenient to batch several checks into a single one.
Ideally, when we prove the satisfiability of a certain circuit, it would
be helpful to perform the check of all the 𝜏 repetitions needed to
obtain the desired soundness, in one go. Unfortunately, since in the
ZK protocol the verifier opens different sets of parties across the
𝜏 MPC evaluations, packing these checks together seems difficult,
Session 11B: Zero Knowledge II CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea3035if not impossible. However, we can apply the same idea to batch
together the checking phases in the case of multiple evaluations of
the same circuit.
More precisely, if we want to prove satisfiability of a certain
circuit multiple times, say ℎ, we can amortized these instances
using the reverse multiplication-friendly embedding (RMFE) [13,
18], which provides a way to embed the ring Fℎ
𝑞, for some ℎ > 1,
into a field F𝑞𝑠 , for some 𝑠 > ℎ, so that coordinate-wise products
“map” to multiplications in the extension field. More formally, we
recall the following definition.
Definition A.1. Given a prime power 𝑞 and ℎ, 𝑠 ∈ N, let us con-
sider two F𝑞-linear maps 𝜙 : Fℎ
𝑞. A pair
(𝜙,𝜓)𝑞 is called an (ℎ, 𝑠)-reverse multiplication-friendly embedding
(RMFE) if ∀x, y ∈ Fℎ
𝑞 → F𝑞𝑠 , and 𝜓 : F𝑞𝑠 → Fℎ
𝑞 it holds:
x ⊙ y = 𝜓(𝜙(x) · 𝜙(y)),
where ⊙ is the component-wise product.
Note that 𝜙 is an injective map. In the following, we only focus
on the case 𝑞 = 2 and leave other cases to future works. In [18], the
authors give both asymptotic and concrete results on the existence
of RMFE. In particular:
Lemma A.2. For all 𝑢 ≤ 33, there exists a (3𝑢, 10𝑢 − 5)2-RMFE.
For any 𝑢 ≤ 16, there exists a (2𝑢, 8𝑢)2-RMFE.
Different Options to Improve Efficiency. We explore different options
in order to deal with the multi-instance case with better efficiency.
For each of these alternatives we briefly discuss advantages and
disadvantages.
Check with identical challenges. The first approach simply con-
sists of 𝜏 · ℎ MPC evaluations of the circuit over F2, followed by a
checking phase. We can apply the optimization described in the pre-
vious section and use the some challenge across all the evaluations.
This option will require, at least in the non-interactive case, bigger
𝜏, but this can be mitigated in part by using larger extension fields
for the check. We expect in this case an improvement in prover run
times comparable to that observed for the single instance case.
Evaluations in extension fields. Alternatively, we can use a
RMFE and “pack” ℎ MPC evaluations over F2 into a single evalua-
tion over F2𝑠 , and hence perform the entire proof and verification
in this extension field. The advantage of this approach is to per-
form the computation only one, but over a larger field. In term of
communication this approach will be roughly 2/3 times more costly.
Check in extension fields. Our third option works as follows. In
Phase 1, the prover runs ℎ MPC evaluations over F2 in its head,
exactly as described in the previous sections. Before the next phases,
𝒫, using a (ℎ, 𝑠)2 (𝜙,𝜓)-RMFE, consistently maps all the ℎ · 𝑚
multiplication triples in F2 that need to be checked to 𝑚 triples in
F2𝑠 , and proceeds to the next phases. In more details, given ⟨x𝑖⟩,
⟨y𝑖⟩, ⟨z𝑖⟩ ∈ Fℎ
2, we can apply 𝜙 to these 𝑚 vectors and obtains
𝜙(x𝑖) = 𝑥𝑖, 𝜙(y𝑖) = 𝑦𝑖, 𝜙(z𝑖) = 𝑧𝑖. Note that if x ⊙ y = z ⊙ 1, then
𝜓(𝜙(x𝑖) · 𝜙(y𝑖) − 𝜙(z𝑖) · 𝜙(1)) = 0.
(1)
Setting 𝑧𝑖 · 𝜙(1) = 𝜉𝑖, the prover needs to prove that the relation
above holds. The analysis of the soundness of this option differs
from that done in the previous sections, so we leave it for future
works. However, we note that, if the maps 𝜙,𝜓 are efficiently im-
plemented, this approach can lead potentially to better prover run
times.
