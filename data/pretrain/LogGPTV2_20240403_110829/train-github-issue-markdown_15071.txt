Hello,

My wife owns a Nokia Lumia, and we have noticed that it displays my Bootstrap-based websites in a tablet layout rather than adapting to the actual screen width. Additionally, some content overhangs, which is not the intended behavior. I tested the official Bootstrap demo sites to see if the issue was specific to my websites, but they exhibited the same problem.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
