# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
Webpack stores absolute paths for node_modules (not only for node_modules I
believe). So when the base path changes it leads to error like that:
    [webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy/webpack.FileSystemInfo]
    /Users/v7rulnik/projects/project/node_modules/emojis-list invalidated because hashes differ
    (missing != emojis-list@3.0.0)
The main problem that there are environments where users can't control the
base directory. For example Jenkins CI. Base directory in Jenkins looks like
this: `/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/$PROJECT_NAME_$GIT_BRANCH/`. So it's
impossible to share cache between branches.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
  1. Run webpack with cache enabled in the project directory, for example: `~/project/`
  2. Rename project directory: `~/project/ â†’ ~/project_renamed/`
  3. Run webpack in `~/project_renamed/`
**What is the expected behavior?**
The base directory shouldn't affect persistent caching. Maybe we can store
relative paths in pack files and concatenate them with current context?
