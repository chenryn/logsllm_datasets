ments with time delay probes to infer vulnerabilities.
The requests were carefully crafted to ensure that vul-
nerabilities are triggered for veriﬁcation and not persis-
tent or full system exploitation. Further, our scanning
approach was throttled to ensure the availability of the
backend is not affected by the additional load.
• Responsible Disclosure: Lastly, we notiﬁed affected
mobile app developers and third-party mobile service
providers through the appropriate channels. For devel-
opers and third-party service providers who did not re-
spond to our communication, we reported the vulnera-
bilities through the US-CERT [47].
Legal. Similar to Ristenpart et al. [60], we operate within
the legal bounds in conducting this study.
In the US, the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is the governing law
that pertains to use and access of computer systems. The law
states, in brief, that access to any computer system must be
authorized, but does so in broad terms. The decision from the
case of Moulton v VC3 (2000) sets a precedent that service
discovery scanning does not cause damages or direct harm to
target systems. Additionally, we assume any internet-facing
service gives implicit permission to access the target com-
puter system, in particular, we refer to how web crawlers
and internet indexing services operate. As we outlined in
our ethical section earlier, we provide subjects the option
to opt-out, perform non-malicious measurement probes, and
use responsible disclosure to notify affected parties.
9 Related Work
Cloud Security. Cloud security has been surveyed exten-
sively [61]–[65]. Xiao et al. [9] performed a comprehensive
analysis of the security issues in cloud services by surveying
high-level provider and tenant issues for the cloud-based ser-
vices in general. Singh et al. [66] presented a survey to iden-
tify common issues reported in third-party cloud services
and summarize the work from the architecture framework,
service and deployment, and cloud technologies perspective.
Our work looks at “in-the-wild” deployment of cloud
services from the OS, SS, AS, and CS perspectives to empiri-
cally study and uncover common issues in mobile backends.
Measurement Studies. Durumeric et al. [67] conducted a
comprehensive internet-wide study of the HTTPS certiﬁcate
ecosystem. Later, Durumeric et al. [59] carried out a simi-
lar internet-wide study for the Heartbleed vulnerability [68].
USENIX Association
28th USENIX Security Symposium    563
Perez-Botero et al. [69] presented an in-depth study charac-
terizing hypervisor vulnerabilities in cloud services. Zuo et
al. [19] proposed a system to identify mobile app URLs and
examine their reputation with public blacklists to detect ma-
licious apps. Our work differs from prior work by studying
a range of vulnerabilities which may affect mobile app back-
ends on the internet.
Empirical Backend Analysis. Zuo et al. [12] performed
an assessment of mobile app backend services by investigat-
ing the cloud offerings of Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.
Our work provides a wider analysis by going beyond just
the third-party service backends and by examining a diverse
set of cloud-based backends. Fernandes et al. [70] analyzed
the top apps found in the Samsung SmartThings platform to
identify permission issues. We follow a similar approach but
focus on the mobile app integration with cloud services in-
stead of IoT apps and cloud services. Alrawi et al. [71] pre-
sented a systematization security assessment of home-based
IoT devices and their companion cloud and mobile apps. Our
work encompasses a wider application, beyond only IoT mo-
bile apps, and a more focused assessment by looking at the
supporting backends provided by cloud services.
10 Conclusion
This paper presented SkyWalker, an analysis pipeline to
study mobile app backends. We used SkyWalker to empiri-
cally analyze the top 5,000 mobile apps in the Google Play
store and uncovered 655 0-days and 983 N-days instances
affecting thousands of apps. Lastly, we offer SkyWalker as
a public service to help app developers improve the security
of their backends, give insight on what platforms are vulner-
able, and guide developers to ﬁx issues found in their back-
ends: https://MobileBackend.vet.
