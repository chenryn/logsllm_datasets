### Vulnerability Assessment and Responsible Disclosure

To identify potential vulnerabilities, we employed time-delayed probes. These requests were meticulously crafted to ensure that the vulnerabilities are triggered for verification without leading to persistent or full system exploitation. Additionally, our scanning methodology was carefully throttled to prevent any additional load from affecting the availability of the backend systems.

#### Responsible Disclosure
Upon identifying affected mobile applications and third-party mobile service providers, we notified them through appropriate communication channels. For those who did not respond to our initial communication, we reported the vulnerabilities to the US-CERT [47].

### Legal Considerations
Similar to the approach taken by Ristenpart et al. [60], our study adhered to legal boundaries. In the United States, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) governs the use and access of computer systems. This act broadly states that access to any computer system must be authorized. The case of Moulton v. VC3 (2000) set a precedent that service discovery scanning does not cause damages or direct harm to target systems. We also assumed that any internet-facing service implicitly grants permission for access, similar to how web crawlers and internet indexing services operate. As outlined in our ethical section, we provided subjects with the option to opt-out, conducted non-malicious measurement probes, and used responsible disclosure to notify affected parties.

### Related Work

#### Cloud Security
Cloud security has been extensively surveyed [61]â€“[65]. Xiao et al. [9] conducted a comprehensive analysis of security issues in cloud services, covering high-level provider and tenant issues. Singh et al. [66] presented a survey identifying common issues in third-party cloud services from an architectural, service, and deployment perspective. Our work focuses on the "in-the-wild" deployment of cloud services, examining common issues from the perspectives of OS, SS, AS, and CS to empirically study and uncover vulnerabilities in mobile backends.

#### Measurement Studies
Durumeric et al. [67] conducted a comprehensive internet-wide study of the HTTPS certificate ecosystem. Later, they carried out a similar study for the Heartbleed vulnerability [59]. Perez-Botero et al. [69] characterized hypervisor vulnerabilities in cloud services, while Zuo et al. [19] proposed a system to identify mobile app URLs and examine their reputation using public blacklists to detect malicious apps. Our work differs by studying a range of vulnerabilities that may affect mobile app backends on the internet.

#### Empirical Backend Analysis
Zuo et al. [12] assessed mobile app backend services by investigating the cloud offerings of Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Our work provides a broader analysis by examining a diverse set of cloud-based backends beyond just third-party service backends. Fernandes et al. [70] analyzed top apps on the Samsung SmartThings platform to identify permission issues, while Alrawi et al. [71] presented a systematic security assessment of home-based IoT devices and their companion cloud and mobile apps. Our work encompasses a wider application, focusing on the integration of mobile apps with cloud services rather than just IoT apps and cloud services.

### Conclusion
This paper introduces SkyWalker, an analysis pipeline for studying mobile app backends. Using SkyWalker, we empirically analyzed the top 5,000 mobile apps in the Google Play store and uncovered 655 0-day and 983 N-day instances affecting thousands of apps. We offer SkyWalker as a public service to help app developers improve the security of their backends, provide insights into vulnerable platforms, and guide developers in fixing issues found in their backends: https://MobileBackend.vet.
