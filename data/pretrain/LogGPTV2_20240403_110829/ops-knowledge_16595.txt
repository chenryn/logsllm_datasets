User: How to monitor Spring Boot application with Prometheus?
Assistant: To use Prometheus to monitor a Spring Boot application, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Add dependencies: Add the Spring Boot Actuator and Prometheus Client libraries to the pom.xml file ``` <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</ groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>io.prometheus</groupId> <artifactId>simpleclient_spring_boot</artifactId> <version>0.3.0</version > </dependency> ``` 2. Configure the application: add the following to the application.yml file ``` management: endpoints: web: exposure: include: prometheus ``` This will expose a /prometheus endpoint so that Prometheus Metric data can be pulled through this endpoint. 3. Register metrics: Use the Prometheus client library to register metrics in your Spring Boot application. The following sample code can be used: ``` import io.prometheus.client.Counter; import io.prometheus.client.Gauge; @Component public class CustomMetrics { private Counter requestCount; private Gauge requestLatency; public CustomMetrics() { requestCount = Counter. build() .name("myapp_request_count_total") .help("Total number of requests.") .register(); requestLatency = Gauge.build() .name("myapp_request_latency_seconds") .help("Latency in seconds.") .register(); } public void incrementRequestCount() { requestCount.inc(); } public void setRequestLatency(double latencyInSeconds) { requestLatency.set(latencyInSeconds); } } ``` 4. Start the application: Now you can start Spring Boot the application and access the Prometheus /metrics endpoint. Prometheus will pull metrics data from this endpoint. Note: You also need to add relevant metrics rules in the Prometheus configuration file. In the example, you need to add the following rules: ``` - record: myapp_request_count_total expr: sum(myapp_request_count_total) by (job) - record: myapp_avg_request_latency_seconds expr: avg(myapp_request_latency_seconds) by (job) ``` This will allow Prometheus to use myapp_request_count_total and myapp_avg_request_latency_seconds metrics. You can use these metrics to create dashboards or alerts.
