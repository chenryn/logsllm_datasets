7. CONCLUSION
We presented an extension to the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya cre-
dential system that features efﬁcient encoding and proofs of binary
and ﬁnite-set attributes. The idea to leverage coprime and divisibil-
ity properties in proofs gains us strong performance improvements.
We pay the price of certifying prime/attribute value relationships in
the issuer’s public key and win the ability to facilitate proofs of pos-
session, equality, AND, NOT, and OR proofs very efﬁciently. Our
method overcomes the fundamental limitation of all existing cre-
dential systems that their complexity is linear in the total number
of attributes. It allows us to fold many ﬁnite set attributes in a single
attribute base and therefore boosts the performance of all proofs of
possession. Our new proof primitives on the prime-encoding facil-
10In traditional encodings this is not the case. If a traditional CL
system receives a policy from a service provider that requires 25
ﬁnite-set attributes and 100 OR-clauses, the system will facilitate
25 commitments and 100 equality proofs executing roughly 150
exponentiations. Our system would ﬁnish after 23 exponentia-
tions independently from the policy. We stress that this holds for
pure conjunctions (only containing AND-clauses) and disjunctions
(only containing OR-clauses). This situation is more diverse for
nested logical statements.
itate AND, NOT, and OR statements with constant complexity and
minimal overhead to a standard proof of possession. Our method
does not require additional cryptographic assumptions apart from
Strong-RSA.
Our method targets the major attribute classes of credential sys-
tems. In fact, we perceive that only a minority of attributes requires
a generic string or integer attribute (such as name and birthday),
whereas most attributes are either binary or taken from a ﬁnite set
of discrete values. Those are the attributes which applications need
for logical statements. Emerging efforts to standardize vocabulary
for identity federation protocols in different application areas sup-
port our hypothesis. We demonstrated that our method impacts real
applications such as electronic identity cards or complex forms of
professional and medical credentials.

APPENDIX
A. PROFESSIONAL TAXONOMIES
Virtually all professional organizations have elaborate tax-
onomies of expertise and attributes of clients and objects. Most tax-
onomies are hierarchically organized and beneﬁt from statements
on all their granularity levels. The user may realize any sub-tree or
path to a terminal leave from the full taxonomy tree.
Expertise
Let us assume that the ACM decided to issue credentials to their
members. These credentials shall contain an expertise classiﬁca-
tion according to the ACM Computing Classiﬁcation Scheme [2].
This well-known taxonomy is a tree with depth four with eleven
areas and roughly 1400 disciplines, sub-disciplines, and topics. To
encode one path to a terminal leaf of the taxonomy (e.g., “E. Data
– 3. Data encryption – Public key crypto systems – PKI”), a tradi-
tional credential system would require four attribute bases. That is,
four bases per expertise area the user can realize at the same time.
We assume that a ACM member may choose three expertise areas.
In addition, the ACM allows a choice from sixteen general terms,
which are in fact a multi-variate ﬁnite set. For this, a traditional
credential system reserves additional bases. The total number of re-
quired bases is proportional to the depth of the taxonomy times the
potential attribute realizations with an offset for the multi-variate
ﬁnite set. The prime-encoding can represent arbitrarily many at-
tribute realizations in just one attribute base.
PCCS:
Let us assume that a user wants to prove the following policy
expertise ⊃ {E.Data, 3.Encryption, E.3.PKI} ∧
expertise ⊃ {D.SW, 4.OS, 4.6.Security, 4.6.Auth} ∧
general ⊃ {performance, security} .
This policy asks for an conjunction proof over all these attributes.
We analyzed in Section 5.2.1 which steps different encodings re-
quire. Our system encodes the proof as a single multi-element
AND-proof integrated in the proof of possession. We compare the
complexity in Table 4.
Medical Records
Our new credential system impacts healthcare and medical record
credentials tremendously. Healthcare practitioners classify all dis-
eases according to the International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Dis-
eases and Related Health Problems (ICD) [43, 44]. This is a tax-
onomy tree with depth ﬁve: chapters, sub-chapters, section, class,
Table 4: Complexity in expertise scenario: CL requires one
commitment and equality proof per relevant attribute; the
prime encoding’s proof of possession covers the AND-proof
cost-free.

and sub-class.11 Likewise, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-VI-TR) [1, 42] is a taxonomy tree of depth
ﬁve. Psychiatrists classify mental disorders according to ﬁve axes,
16 categories, subcategories, disorder classes and sub-classes.12 To
encode a single path in such a taxonomy in a traditional credential
system, one would require ﬁve attribute bases per realized terminal
leaf. And clearly, there is a need for specifying multiple symptoms
or potential diagnoses.
Even though healthcare cards are still in their infancy, there are
debates on storing certiﬁed medical data on such cards. This op-
tion is very privacy-sensitive. Our proposal allows for selective-
disclosure of medical information according to standardized tax-
onomies with variable granularity.
Implementing this on smart-
cards with traditional credential systems is virtually impossible as
the growing number of attribute bases would render any proof of
possession inefﬁcient. Our system allows to encode many realiza-
tions of deep taxonomies within a single attribute base with strong
performance improvements.
For instance, let us assume that user holds a certiﬁed diagnosis
credential that may reserve ﬁve possible path in the taxonomy. The
policy PMED demands to prove that one of the diagnoses matches
either one of a set of, say 25, bacterial disease classes that are eli-
gible for acquiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. Clearly, it is highly
desirable to hide the actual diagnosis in certain applciations. There-
fore, the proof must be done with an OR-proof without disclosing
the actual disease. This policy is similar to earlier OR-proofs, such
as exercised in Section 5.2.3, only restricted to a single relevant
attribute. Our credential system does the same proof a third of the
term number and a fourth of the required exponentiations (Table 5).
11A classiﬁcation could for instance be “I. Determined infectious
and parasitic diseases – Infectious diseases (A) – Infectious abdom-
inal diseases (A00–A09) – A01.- Typhus-alike – A01.2 Paratyphus
B”
12For instance sleepwalking would be “Axis I – 13. Sleep disorders
– Parasomnias – Sleepwalking”.
