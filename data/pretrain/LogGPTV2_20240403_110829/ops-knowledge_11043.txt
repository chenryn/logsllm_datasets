User: I've been writing and using short Python scripts (~100 lines) for various tasks in Ubuntu using the Geany text editor, which I like for it's simplicity (setup, F5 to run, etc.) and syntax highlighting. 
I would like to know if there is a similar application for Windows. Because what I've found so far requires downloading 3 different applications or using a big IDE like eclipse.
Assistant: Any good programmer's text editor will do. I personally use SublimeText 3, but I've used Eclipse + PyDev before to great success, and the usual suspects (emacs, vim, Notepad++) will work just fine too.
