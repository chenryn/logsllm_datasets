basis, with some regions experiencing 240% increases in
area burned, while others will see a decrease of up to 119%.
Understanding these changes can inform long term cell in-
frastructure planning.
3.10 Strategies to Mitigate Risk
Identifying strategies for mitigating wildfire risk that bal-
ance costs with impact is an important but complex task,
which requires the participation of multiple stakeholders
including service providers, power utilities, government and
local communities. Our findings provide critical guidance
for identifying and prioritizing where resources should be al-
located to reduce the risk of loss of service and infrastructure
damage due to wildfires.
A starting point for wildfire risk mitigation strategy formu-
lation is the categories of outages identified by the FCC. First,
cellular providers must plan for backup power generation for
multiple days at a time. For example, a combination of solar
cells and battery storage could be used to maintain power
at cell sites without requiring technicians to refuel diesel
generators [8]. This is especially important in light of the
fact that 80% of 911 emergency calls in California were made
by cell phone in 2019 [28]. Providers could work with power
utilities to manage mutually effective defensive installation,
prevention, and reaction measures to assure power. Second,
continuous management of vegetation growth around cell
sites will lower the risk that the sites themselves are damaged
by wildfires. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) recommends rerouting distribution
networks along roadways or railways, which often receive
consistent vegetation management. Third, preventive mea-
sures such as using non-flammable building materials or
fire-retardant coating for towers will reduce damage. Fourth,
care must be taken to ensure that consistent power is sent
to optical regeneration equipment. While these measures
will help to assure cellular communication during and after
wildfires, further steps could be considered.
Mitigation strategies in the high risk areas identified in
our study could also include reducing fuel through mandated
vegetation removal or low-intensity prescribed burns. From
a longer term perspective managing community growth by
creating ‘community defensible zones’, such as large fields
or parking lots, and enforcing building codes to include use
of inflammable materials and screened ventilation systems
would reduce the ability of embers to penetrate building
interiors [24]. Finally, it is essential to have plans in place for
emergency response in the event of a wildfire. Our findings
can help to guide development of response plans that include
assurance of cellular communication capability during and
after a wildfire.
Summary. Although cellular service providers can take
some measures, such as clearing vegetation around cell sites
and installing backup power, comprehensive mitigation strate-
gies must be developed by key stakeholders to protect cel-
lular service in the face of wildfire threats. Execution of the
strategies in terms of priorities and resources can be guided
by the identification of high risk areas in our study.
3.11 Limitations
Although we argue that our research provides an accurate
baseline for risk from wildfires to cell infrastructure, there
are some limitations due the data sets we use and some
aspects of our methodology. The first is not fully accounting
for risk from loss of power and the second is not accounting
for wildfire escape probability.
Our case study of power outages in California in 2019
highlights the impact of power outages due to wildfires,
both from preventative measures and from direct effect from
wildfires. We continue to explore the relationship between
the power utilities and telecommunications infrastructure
to fully account for that risk and will report our findings in
future work.
As discussed earlier in our validation of the WHP-enabled
analysis, WHP provides a likelihood of wildfire occurrence
in specific locations. Most wildfires are contained quickly
and do not cause much damage or destruction. Therefore, the
WHP model is useful to understand where wildfires may start
and to identify the infrastructure in the immediate vicinity
that may be affected. However, wildfires that escape initial
containment can have devastating effects on a wide area.
Understanding the probability of escape and furthest extent
of damage from wildfires is not built into the WHP model.
Our research can be extended to include regionalized es-
cape probability such as with the highly optimized tolerance
(HOT) framework from Moritz et al [26]. This framework
models the probability of occurrence of various size wild-
fires, but would need to be adapted to account for variance
of wildfire activity in different regions and to incorporate
the locations of cell infrastructure to be integrated into our
model. Although large or high-frequency wildfires can have
many negative environmental effects, they do not necessar-
ily damage cellular communication infrastructure. We also
plan to examine this in future work.
By design, our research focused on the physical threat of
wildfires to cellular infrastructure. An alternate approach
could be to examine the wildfire threat to cellular service
coverage. Although this is outside the scope of our current
research, this approach could be pursued in future research.
There are three limitations incurred from using the Open-
CelliD data set of cell infrastructure. The first is that, as a
crowd-sourced database, it may be more complete for those
areas with higher population density, simply because those
areas are more likely to be traversed. Therefore, it is not pos-
sible to derive exact information about affected customers.
We overcome this limitation by using all records in the data-
base, gathered from 2005 to 2019. However, this leads to the
second limitation. OpenCelliD does not maintain historical
records on the temporal evolution of cell transceivers in their
database, so the database that we used does not account for
infrastructure changes. Third, because transceiver locations
are primarily calculated with received signal strength from
handsets, the transceiver locations may be inaccurate. Each
of these limitations could be addressed with accurate infras-
tructure records and maps from cellular service providers,
which were not publicly available at the time of this research.
Additionally, there are many opportunities for future work
to determine socioeconomic impact of loss of network infras-
tructure. Quantifying the effects of loss of cellular service
during emergencies such as wildfires is beyond the scope of
this research, but will be pursued in future work.
Summary. Wildfires are unpredictable, with a small num-
ber of fires that escape containment causing the majority
of damage and service disruption. Extending our analysis
by using more accurate infrastructure maps, accounting for
power outages and escape probability, or accounting for so-
cioeconomic impacts could improve our wildfire risk forecast.
4 RELATED WORK
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has
produced multiple reports grounded in climate change re-
search, including a recent Special Report [34] that identifies
wildfires as a risk to value of land, human health, ecosys-
tem health, and infrastructure. It further identifies large geo-
graphic regions that are most susceptible to wildfire damage:
North America, South America, the Mediterranean, southern
Africa, and central Asia. This research provides details on
how these risks manifest onto Internet infrastructure. Many
previous research efforts have focused on understanding
the effect that climate change will have on the potential oc-
currence, intensity, and frequency of wildfires e.g., [12, 35].
Schoennagel et al. [32] made the case that as a society, we
must undertake holistic adaptations for society to thrive in
changing conditions due to wildfires. Our research takes a
more focused look at the cellular communications compo-
nent of critical infrastructure.
Previous studies from the European Union [33], the United
Kingdom [19], and Australia [18] considered the general ef-
fects of climate change on energy and Internet infrastructure
in those regions. Our research differs from these studies in
our GIS-based analysis to pinpoint specific affected regions
and the cellular infrastructure deployed there.
Natural disasters and the threats that they pose for criti-
cal infrastructure has been widely studied e.g., [21]. These
studies typically consider models for disaster threats and
potential impact including cascading failures [30]. Natural
disaster threats and their impacts on Internet communica-
tion infrastructure in particular have been considered and
analyzed in a number of prior studies e.g., [13, 14, 27]. Sev-
eral studies have described mitigation strategies that adjust
Internet routing to assure service during natural disaster
events in [17, 31]. We are informed by these studies but to
the best of our knowledge, none consider specific threats to
cellular communication systems.
Looking at the effects of climate change on Internet in-
frastructure in the US, previous research studied the effects
of sea-level rise on Internet long-haul fiber and data cen-
ters [16]. Our current research considers another aspect of
climate change that could affect Internet access: wildfires
and how they threaten cellular infrastructure.
5 SUMMARY
In this research, we assess and quantify the threat from wild-
fires to cellular infrastructure in the US through geospatial
analysis of wildfire occurrence and cellular infrastructure
deployment. We identify the cellular infrastructure that is
under the highest threat from wildfires as well as the impli-
cated infrastructure that provides service to the most people.
Through a case study of wildfires in California in 2019, we
identify power outages as the leading cause of loss of service
for cellular infrastructure. We identify California, Texas, and
Florida as the states with the largest amount of infrastruc-
ture at risk. Our study culminates with an analysis of the
geographic distribution of cellular infrastructure around the
23 most populous counties in the US, identifying Los An-
geles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Orlando
as the metropolitan areas with the largest amount of cel-
lular infrastructure in danger from wildfires. Our results
can serve as a guide for communication assurance efforts
from federal through municipal levels and for risk planning
and mitigation efforts by cellular infrastructure owners and
service providers. In on-going work, we are investigating
techniques for cellular deployment that can reduce wild-
fire risk, hardening cellular sites, improving capabilities for
firefighters during wildfires and investigating correspond-
ing critical infrastructure – in particular power transport
systems – toward the goal of mitigating wildfire threats.
