### Basis and Regional Impact
Our analysis reveals that some regions may experience up to a 240% increase in the area burned by wildfires, while others could see a decrease of up to 119%. Understanding these regional variations is crucial for long-term cellular infrastructure planning.

### 3.10 Strategies to Mitigate Risk
Identifying effective strategies to mitigate wildfire risk, while balancing costs and impact, is a complex task that requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including service providers, power utilities, government agencies, and local communities. Our findings offer critical guidance for prioritizing resource allocation to reduce the risk of service disruptions and infrastructure damage due to wildfires.

#### Key Strategies
1. **Backup Power Generation:**
   - Cellular providers should plan for backup power generation capable of sustaining operations for several days. For example, a combination of solar cells and battery storage can maintain power at cell sites without the need for technicians to refuel diesel generators [8]. This is particularly important given that 80% of 911 emergency calls in California were made via cell phone in 2019 [28].
   - Providers can collaborate with power utilities to implement mutually beneficial defensive measures, such as preventive and reactive power management strategies.

2. **Vegetation Management:**
   - Continuous management of vegetation around cell sites can significantly reduce the risk of damage from wildfires. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends rerouting distribution networks along roadways or railways, which often receive consistent vegetation management.

3. **Fire-Resistant Materials:**
   - Using non-flammable building materials or fire-retardant coatings for towers can help minimize damage from wildfires.

4. **Power Consistency:**
   - Ensuring consistent power supply to optical regeneration equipment is essential to maintain cellular communication during and after wildfires.

5. **Fuel Reduction:**
   - In high-risk areas, reducing fuel through mandated vegetation removal or low-intensity prescribed burns can help mitigate wildfire risk.

6. **Community Resilience:**
   - Long-term community growth management, such as creating "community defensible zones" like large fields or parking lots, and enforcing building codes that require the use of non-flammable materials and screened ventilation systems, can reduce the risk of embers penetrating building interiors [24].

7. **Emergency Response Planning:**
   - It is essential to have comprehensive emergency response plans in place, including ensuring cellular communication capability during and after a wildfire.

### Summary
While cellular service providers can take specific measures, such as clearing vegetation and installing backup power, a comprehensive mitigation strategy must be developed by key stakeholders to protect cellular service in the face of wildfire threats. Prioritizing resources and implementing these strategies can be guided by the identification of high-risk areas in our study.

### 3.11 Limitations
Although our research provides a robust baseline for wildfire risk to cellular infrastructure, there are some limitations:

1. **Power Outage Risk:**
   - Our study does not fully account for the risk from loss of power, which was highlighted in our case study of power outages in California in 2019. We are continuing to explore the relationship between power utilities and telecommunications infrastructure to better understand this risk.

2. **Wildfire Escape Probability:**
   - The Wildland-Human Interface (WHP) model we used provides a likelihood of wildfire occurrence but does not account for the probability of wildfire escape and the extent of potential damage. Future work will incorporate the Highly Optimized Tolerance (HOT) framework from Moritz et al. [26] to address this limitation.

3. **Data Set Limitations:**
   - The OpenCelliD data set, which is crowd-sourced, may be more complete in areas with higher population density. Additionally, it lacks historical records on the temporal evolution of cell transceivers and may have inaccuracies in transceiver locations. These limitations could be addressed with accurate infrastructure records and maps from cellular service providers.

4. **Socioeconomic Impact:**
   - Quantifying the socioeconomic impact of network infrastructure loss during emergencies, such as wildfires, is beyond the scope of this research but will be pursued in future work.

### Summary
Wildfires are unpredictable, with a small number of fires causing the majority of damage and service disruption. Enhancing our analysis with more accurate infrastructure maps, accounting for power outages and escape probability, and considering socioeconomic impacts can improve our wildfire risk forecast.

### 4. Related Work
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified wildfires as a significant threat to land value, human health, ecosystem health, and infrastructure. Previous research has focused on the effects of climate change on wildfire occurrence, intensity, and frequency. Our study specifically examines the cellular communications component of critical infrastructure, providing a detailed GIS-based analysis to pinpoint affected regions and deployed cellular infrastructure.

### 5. Summary
In this research, we assess and quantify the threat from wildfires to cellular infrastructure in the US through geospatial analysis. We identify the cellular infrastructure under the highest threat and the infrastructure serving the most people. A case study of wildfires in California in 2019 highlights power outages as the leading cause of service loss. Our results can guide communication assurance efforts and risk planning at federal, state, and municipal levels, and by cellular infrastructure owners and service providers.
