**ATT&CK ID:** T1567.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exfiltration to Code Repository

Adversaries may exfiltrate sensitive data to a code repository instead of using their primary command and control (C2) channel. Code repositories, such as GitHub, typically provide access through APIs (e.g., `https://api.github.com`). These APIs are often accessed over HTTPS, which provides an additional layer of encryption and security for the adversary. This method can help adversaries avoid detection by blending their exfiltration activities with legitimate traffic to and from the code repository.
