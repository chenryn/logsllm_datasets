Subject: Adjusting the Default Window Size for Script Execution in Geany

Dear Support Team,

I am currently using Geany 0.18 for Python development and am generally very satisfied with its performance. However, there is a minor issue that I would like to address.

When I use the F5 (Build -> Execute) option to test my scripts, the resulting window is quite small. This makes it difficult to read lines of text that are too long. I would like to change the default size of this window, but I have not found any settings or options to do so within Geany.

Is it possible to adjust the default window size for the terminal that pops up when I hit F5?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Mischa

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you can modify the terminal command that Geany uses to execute your scripts. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Open Preferences:**
   - Go to `Edit` > `Preferences`.

2. **Navigate to the Tools Tab:**
   - In the Preferences window, select the `Tools` tab.

3. **Modify the Terminal Command:**
   - You will find an input field labeled `Terminal`. This field allows you to specify the terminal program and any additional parameters.
   - To open the terminal in a maximized state, you can set the command to `"gnome-terminal --maximize"`.

For more window options and parameters available in Gnome-Terminal, you can run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
gnome-terminal --help-window-options
```

This should help you customize the terminal window to better suit your needs.
