User: I'm using Geany 0.18 for python developing and am in general really satisfied, but there is one little thing, that's still bugging me:
I usually use the F5 (Build-->Execute) option to test my scripts, the appearing window is rather small, and if my script prints lines which are too long they are hard to read. I would like to change the default-window size of the little one popping up if I hit F5, but I haven't found anything to accomplish this.
Is this possible at all ?
Thanks
Mischa
Assistant: To solve that problem I added additional parameters to terminal command that geany runs.

In Geany go to preferences (Edit->Preferences).
Open Tools tab.
There is an input field named Terminal where you can specify terminal program to use.
I changed that to "gnome-terminal --maximize" to open terminal maximized.

For Gnome-Terminal you can find more window options running "gnome-terminal --help-window-options" from terminal.
