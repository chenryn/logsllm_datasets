ABSTRACT
Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages (PASTA) is a well known
property applicable to many stochastic systems. In active probing,
PASTA is invoked to justify the sending of probe packets (or trains)
at Poisson times in a variety of contexts. However, due to the di-
versity of aims and analysis techniques used in active probing, the
beneﬁts of Poisson based measurement, and the utility and role of
PASTA, are unclear. Using a combination of rigorous results and
carefully constructed examples and counter-examples, we map out
the issues involved, and argue that PASTA is of very limited use in
active probing. In particular, Poisson probes are not unique in their
ability to sample without bias. Furthermore, PASTA ignores the
issue of estimation variance, and the central need for an inversion
phase to estimate the quantity of interest based on what is directly
observable. We give concrete examples of when Poisson probes
should not be used, and explain why, and offer initial guidelines on
suitable alternative sending processes.

INTRODUCTION
Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages, or ‘PASTA’, is a property
applicable to many stochastic systems.
In essence, it states that
observations made of a system at time instants obeying a Poisson
process, when averaged, converge to give the ‘true’ value, that is
to the average that an ideal observer would make when monitoring
the system continuously over time. PASTA was ﬁrst formalized
by probabilists, notably in the 1970’s. Wolff, in his classic 1982
paper [22], uniﬁed and extended the then-existing PASTA results.
The generality of his formulation, based on the ‘Lack of Antici-
pation Assumption’, which requires simply that the past history of
the system does not inﬂuence the arrival times of future observers,
did away with the need to prove ergodic theorems for each new
application, and led to PASTA being widely used.
PASTA has been used [13, 14, 20, 23] to justify the sending of
probes (or probe trains) at Poisson epochs in an effort to obtain
unbiased estimates of quantities of interest, for example end-to-
end delay. However, despite the generality of the PASTA result
of Wolff, in many respects the role and utility of PASTA for ac-
tive probing has become unclear both in the theoretical and prac-
tical senses. This paper aims to clarify what Poisson probing, and
PASTA itself, can and cannot provide for active probing. In this
context, key questions include
• When is PASTA valid in the strict sense?
• When and in what sense is PASTA useful when it holds? is
• Are there cases when Poisson probes should not be used?
• What role is played by PASTA within the inference problems
Poisson probing necessarily optimal?
of active probing?
Related to this last point there is an important, prior question: What
does PASTA apply to? In other words, Poisson Arrivals See Time
Averages, but of what? does PASTA hold for any quantity that may
form the object of active probing?
Our main focus in this paper is on end-to-end delay over a tan-
dem queueing network, to which PASTA can in fact apply. Delay
is a simple, yet important target of active probing measurement in
its own right. A natural aim in this context would be to accurately
determine any desired statistic of the delay that would be experi-
enced by a single packet of any given size sent into the network in
its steady state regime, for example the distribution of such a delay.
A particular case is the virtual work of queueing theory, which cor-
responds to the delay a zero sized packet would see, under FIFO
scheduling, when sent into the network in steady state. By care-
fully distinguishing between the non-intrusive case (virtual probes
of zero size) and the intrusive case (real probes of ﬁnite size), we
provide important insights into the above questions. The simplicity
of delay allows rigorous results to be derived, and yet it provides a
context rich enough to inform active probing techniques in general.
Our ﬁndings group naturally under three distinct categories, and
can be summarised as follows.
Sampling Bias versus Intrusiveness
• PASTA states that Poisson sampling is unbiased. In the non-
intrusive case, we show that this is not unique to Poisson but
is shared by a large class of other sampling processes.
• PASTA states that Poisson sampling remains unbiased even
when observers are not virtual, but contribute to system load.
Apart from a few exceptions ([11]), this property is not shared
by other sampling processes. We argue that it does not follow
that Poisson is superior, because of variance and inversion is-
sues, described next.
• We show that rare probes can be used to avoid issues of intru-
siveness and inversion, and that in such a scenario, Poisson
is no longer special anyway.
Bias versus Variance
which is nonetheless of equal importance to estimation.
• PASTA is a statement about bias.
It is silent on variance,
• There is no general result stating the optimality of Poisson
observations with respect to variance or Mean Square Error
(MSE), except asymptotically for MSE in the intrusive case1.
Indeed, optimality would in general require a probing stream
which is well matched in some sense to network characteris-
tics. In Section 2.2 we give explicit examples showing that
Poisson probing can be sub-optimal.
Sampling versus Inversion
• To obtain ‘what one wants’ from what has been observed, for
example what the delay distribution would have been if the
observers were non-intrusive, based on measurements that
were free of sampling bias but which were intrusive, an ad-
ditional inversion step is required. Inversion is typically com-
plex, and in general impacts both bias and variance.
• PASTA is silent on inversion. There is no result stating that
Poisson sampling is unbiased, or otherwise optimal, for the
full problem of sampling followed by inversion. Further-
more, the zero sampling bias of Poisson in the intrusive case
is not necessarily an advantage when it assists in measuring
the wrong quantity. It may even be that inversion is impos-
sible, in which case Poisson sampling cannot magically pro-
vide unbiased estimates.
Finally, we also strongly emphasize the fact that PASTA does not
always hold, as it, in common with alternative probing strategies,
requires important conditions to be satisﬁed.
The picture that emerges is that PASTA plays only a very re-
stricted role in active probing. In a nutshell, active probing estima-
tion seeks to optimise total bias as well as variance performance,
and must therefore address both sampling and inversion issues.
PASTA deals only with sampling of the available observable, not
with inversion to the ﬁnal quantity of interest, is ignorant of vari-
ance, and furthermore excludes the low variance potential of alter-
native schemes which also enjoy zero sampling bias. In contrast,
it’s strength, a lack of sampling bias even in the intrusive case, is
not necessarily relevant given the near universal need for inversion.
1See the end of Section 2.2, and recall MSE = bias2 + variance.
We conclude that Poisson probing is poorly motivated, and recom-
mend a Probe Pattern Separation Rule as an alternative default for
both probes and probe patterns, which offers several advantages.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2
uses simple queueing systems to map out the key issues and con-
cepts, and to give examples of many of the main results and insights
in a simple setting. Section 3 introduces the mathematical machin-
ery used to prove results on the bias of sampling processes in a
more general setting. We restrict ourselves to hypothetical zero
sized probes in this section. In Section 4, we consider probes of
non-zero size, examine PASTA, and give a result on rare probing,
a generic strategy to avoid bias. We then combine our ﬁndings and
motivate the introduction of a Probe Pattern Separation Rule as
an alternative to the exponential separation of Poisson probing. In
Section 5 we survey selected prior work on PASTA and its applica-
tion in network measurement, and conclude in section 6.
2. PASTA AND DELAY: THE ISSUES
In this section we illustrate the key facts and issues involved in
measuring end-to-end delay from probes, and the role of PASTA,
in the simple context of a single, FIFO queue, fed by probe trafﬁc
and cross-trafﬁc obeying simple models. As we proceed, we high-
light those results which will receive a more general and rigorous
treatment in Section 3. In other cases, the results are in the form of
counter-examples which prove general points as well as illustrate
them.
As several of the examples employ the M/M/1 queue, we sum-
marize some relevant properties here. In the M/M/1 system, pack-
ets arrive as a Poisson process of rate λ, and each takes an expo-
nential amount of time, with average μ, to be serviced2. To ensure
stability and (strict) stationarity of the system, we require the sys-
tem utilisation ρ = λμ to satisfy ρ  0). Left: CDF as seen by various probing streams, and true delay distributions
(one per stream, the closest grey curve in each case). Right: resulting probe based mean estimates, and true means. Each probing
stream results in a new true delay distribution, which is sampled with bias by the probes, except the Poisson case (PASTA).
eg. [8]) on waiting times deﬁning the system and is exact to ma-
chine precision. Two kinds of statistics are collected. First, per-
packet delay values, from which the delays, regardless of packet
size, due to probe trafﬁc or cross-trafﬁc can be extracted. Second,
the waiting time distribution W is obtained by observing the vir-
tual delay process W (t) continuously over time. As it is stored in
histogram form, there is a discretisation error. However, this error
can be bounded, and we control it in each case so that errors are
negligible on the scale of the plots given. Similarly, we use long
simulations of 1000000 probes to make conﬁdence intervals small
or negligible (in the latter case we don’t show them), and employ
warmup periods of at least 10 ¯d to damp transients. From the ob-
served W (t), we obtain the distribution of D for non-zero probes
by convolving with the probe size distribution.
Finally, recall that if a is some parameter of stochastic data, then
an estimator of a is any function bA of the data designed to estimate
a; this estimator is unbiased if a = IE[ ˆA].
2.1 Bias
We will consider each of sampling bias in the intrusive case,
sampling bias in the non-intrusive case, and inversion bias. Five
different arrival processes - including ‘Poisson’, ‘Uniform’, ‘Pareto’,
‘Periodic’, and ‘EAR(1)’, will be used for probes, in order to offer
a spectrum of bursty behaviors. Three of these, namely ‘Poisson’,
‘Uniform’, and ‘Pareto’, are renewal processes, that is inter-arrivals
are given by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variables. They differ only in the choice of distribution, respec-
tively exponential (yielding a Poisson process), uniform, and the
heavy tailed Pareto (with ﬁnite mean but inﬁnite variance). The
‘Periodic’ probe stream is also renewal but in a very degenerate
sense as inter-arrivals are constant, and is best regarded as a deter-
ministic stream (a random uniform phase, determining the offset of
the periodic grid from the time origin, makes it stationary despite
