## Abstract
Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages (PASTA) is a well-known property applicable to many stochastic systems. In active probing, PASTA is often invoked to justify the sending of probe packets (or trains) at Poisson times in various contexts. However, due to the diversity of aims and analysis techniques used in active probing, the benefits of Poisson-based measurement and the utility and role of PASTA are not always clear. Using a combination of rigorous results and carefully constructed examples and counter-examples, we explore the issues involved and argue that PASTA has very limited use in active probing. Specifically, Poisson probes are not unique in their ability to sample without bias. Additionally, PASTA does not address the issue of estimation variance and the central need for an inversion phase to estimate the quantity of interest based on what is directly observable. We provide concrete examples of when Poisson probes should not be used, explain why, and offer initial guidelines on suitable alternative sending processes.

## 1. Introduction
Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages, or 'PASTA', is a property applicable to many stochastic systems. It states that observations made of a system at time instants following a Poisson process, when averaged, converge to the 'true' value, which is the average that an ideal observer would make when monitoring the system continuously over time. PASTA was first formalized by probabilists in the 1970s, and Wolff's classic 1982 paper [22] unified and extended existing PASTA results. The generality of his formulation, based on the 'Lack of Anticipation Assumption', eliminated the need to prove ergodic theorems for each new application, leading to the widespread use of PASTA.

PASTA has been used [13, 14, 20, 23] to justify the sending of probes (or probe trains) at Poisson epochs to obtain unbiased estimates of quantities of interest, such as end-to-end delay. However, despite the generality of Wolff's PASTA result, the role and utility of PASTA for active probing have become unclear both theoretically and practically. This paper aims to clarify what Poisson probing and PASTA can and cannot provide for active probing. Key questions include:
- When is PASTA valid in the strict sense?
- When and in what sense is PASTA useful when it holds?
- Are there cases when Poisson probes should not be used?
- What role does PASTA play within the inference problems of active probing?

Additionally, an important prior question is: What does PASTA apply to? In other words, Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages, but of what? Does PASTA hold for any quantity that may form the object of active probing?

Our main focus in this paper is on end-to-end delay over a tandem queueing network, to which PASTA can apply. Delay is a simple yet important target of active probing. A natural aim in this context is to accurately determine any desired statistic of the delay experienced by a single packet of any given size sent into the network in its steady-state regime, for example, the distribution of such a delay. A particular case is the virtual work of queueing theory, which corresponds to the delay a zero-sized packet would see under FIFO scheduling when sent into the network in steady state. By carefully distinguishing between the non-intrusive case (virtual probes of zero size) and the intrusive case (real probes of finite size), we provide important insights into the above questions. The simplicity of delay allows rigorous results to be derived, and yet it provides a context rich enough to inform active probing techniques in general.

Our findings can be summarized as follows:

### Sampling Bias versus Intrusiveness
- **PASTA and Unbiased Sampling**: PASTA states that Poisson sampling is unbiased. In the non-intrusive case, we show that this is not unique to Poisson but is shared by a large class of other sampling processes.
- **Intrusive Observers**: PASTA states that Poisson sampling remains unbiased even when observers are not virtual and contribute to system load. Apart from a few exceptions ([11]), this property is not shared by other sampling processes. We argue that it does not follow that Poisson is superior, because of variance and inversion issues, described next.
- **Rare Probes**: We show that rare probes can be used to avoid issues of intrusiveness and inversion, and that in such a scenario, Poisson is no longer special.

### Bias versus Variance
- **PASTA and Bias**: PASTA is a statement about bias. It is silent on variance, which is nonetheless of equal importance to estimation.
- **Optimality of Poisson**: There is no general result stating the optimality of Poisson observations with respect to variance or Mean Square Error (MSE), except asymptotically for MSE in the intrusive case [1]. Indeed, optimality would generally require a probing stream well-matched to network characteristics. In Section 2.2, we give explicit examples showing that Poisson probing can be sub-optimal.

### Sampling versus Inversion
- **Inversion Step**: To obtain the desired quantity from what has been observed, for example, the delay distribution if the observers were non-intrusive, based on measurements that were free of sampling bias but intrusive, an additional inversion step is required. Inversion is typically complex and impacts both bias and variance.
- **PASTA and Inversion**: PASTA is silent on inversion. There is no result stating that Poisson sampling is unbiased or otherwise optimal for the full problem of sampling followed by inversion. Furthermore, the zero sampling bias of Poisson in the intrusive case is not necessarily an advantage if it assists in measuring the wrong quantity. Inversion may even be impossible, in which case Poisson sampling cannot provide unbiased estimates.

Finally, we emphasize that PASTA does not always hold, as it, like alternative probing strategies, requires important conditions to be satisfied. The picture that emerges is that PASTA plays only a very restricted role in active probing. Active probing estimation seeks to optimize total bias and variance performance, addressing both sampling and inversion issues. PASTA deals only with sampling the available observable, not with inversion to the final quantity of interest, and is ignorant of variance. It also excludes the low variance potential of alternative schemes that also enjoy zero sampling bias. In contrast, its strength—a lack of sampling bias even in the intrusive case—is not necessarily relevant given the near-universal need for inversion.

We conclude that Poisson probing is poorly motivated and recommend a Probe Pattern Separation Rule as an alternative default for both probes and probe patterns, which offers several advantages. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 uses simple queueing systems to map out the key issues and concepts, and to give examples of many of the main results and insights in a simple setting. Section 3 introduces the mathematical machinery used to prove results on the bias of sampling processes in a more general setting, restricting ourselves to hypothetical zero-sized probes. In Section 4, we consider probes of non-zero size, examine PASTA, and give a result on rare probing, a generic strategy to avoid bias. We then combine our findings and motivate the introduction of a Probe Pattern Separation Rule as an alternative to the exponential separation of Poisson probing. In Section 5, we survey selected prior work on PASTA and its application in network measurement, and conclude in Section 6.

## 2. PASTA and Delay: The Issues
In this section, we illustrate the key facts and issues involved in measuring end-to-end delay from probes and the role of PASTA in the simple context of a single, FIFO queue, fed by probe traffic and cross-traffic obeying simple models. As we proceed, we highlight those results which will receive a more general and rigorous treatment in Section 3. In other cases, the results are in the form of counter-examples that prove general points and illustrate them.

As several of the examples employ the M/M/1 queue, we summarize some relevant properties here. In the M/M/1 system, packets arrive as a Poisson process of rate \(\lambda\), and each takes an exponential amount of time, with average \(\mu\), to be serviced. To ensure stability and (strict) stationarity of the system, we require the system utilization \(\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\) to satisfy \(\rho < 1\).

### 2.1 Bias
We will consider each of the following types of bias: sampling bias in the intrusive case, sampling bias in the non-intrusive case, and inversion bias. Five different arrival processes—'Poisson', 'Uniform', 'Pareto', 'Periodic', and 'EAR(1)'—will be used for probes, offering a spectrum of bursty behaviors. Three of these, namely 'Poisson', 'Uniform', and 'Pareto', are renewal processes, where inter-arrivals are given by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. They differ only in the choice of distribution, respectively exponential (yielding a Poisson process), uniform, and the heavy-tailed Pareto (with finite mean but infinite variance). The 'Periodic' probe stream is also renewal but in a very degenerate sense, as inter-arrivals are constant, and is best regarded as a deterministic stream (a random uniform phase, determining the offset of the periodic grid from the time origin, makes it stationary despite being deterministic).
