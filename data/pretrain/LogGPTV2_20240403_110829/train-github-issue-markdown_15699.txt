Currently the file is only used to detect the virtual project. Now that we
have tsconfig.json support we can use the language service bound to a
tsconfig.json file to find navto items. I would propose the following handling
in case of the absense of a file:
  * no tsconfig project. Command return no content message
  * all projects are tsconfig project: return the nav to items (filter duplicates)
  * there is a mix: the response contains a flag indicating that the result might be incomplete.
