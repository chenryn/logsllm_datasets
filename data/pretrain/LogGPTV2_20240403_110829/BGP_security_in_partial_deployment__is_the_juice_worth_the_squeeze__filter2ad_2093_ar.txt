Moreover, [22] does
not analyze interactions between S*BGP and BGP that arise
during partial deployment (e.g., Table 3).
Finally, [8] includes cryptographic analysis of S*BGP in
partial deployment, and an Internet draft [27] mentions pro-
tocol downgrade attacks. However, neither explores how at-
tacks on partially-deployed S*BGP can impact routing, or
considers the number / type of ASes harmed by an attack.
8. CONCLUSION
On one hand, our results give rise to guidelines for partially-
deployed S*BGP: (1) Deploying lightweight simplex S*BGP
at stub ASes, instead of full-ﬂedged S*BGP; this reduces de-
ployment complexity at the majority of ASes without com-
promising overall security.
(2) Incorporating S*BGP into
routing policies in a similar fashion at all ASes, to avoid
introducing routing anomalies like BGP Wedgies. (3) De-
ploying S*BGP at Tier 2 ISPs, since deployments of S*BGP
at Tier 1s can do little to improve security. On the other
hand, we ﬁnd that partially-deployed S*BGP provides, on
average, limited security beneﬁts over route origin authen-
tication when ASes do not prioritize security 1st.
We hope that our work will call attention to the chal-
lenges that arise during partial deployment, and drive the
development of solutions that can help surmount them. One
idea is to ﬁnd ways to limit protocol downgrade attacks, as
these cause many of our negative results. For example, one
could add “hysteresis” to S*BGP, so that an AS does not im-
mediately drop a secure route when “better” insecure route
appears. Alternatively, one could ﬁnd deployment scenarios
that create “islands” of secure ASes that agree to prioritize
security 1st for routes between ASes in the island; the chal-
lenge is to do this without disrupting existing traﬃc engi-
neering or business arrangements. Other security solutions
could also be explored. For example, origin authentication
with anomaly detection and preﬁx ﬁltering could be easier
to deploy (they can be based on the RPKI), and may be as
eﬀective as partially-deployed S*BGP.
