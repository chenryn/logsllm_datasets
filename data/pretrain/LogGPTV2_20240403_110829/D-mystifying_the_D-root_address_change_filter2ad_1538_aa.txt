**Abstract:**
On January 3, 2013, the D-root DNS server hosted at the University of Maryland changed its IP address. To avoid service disruption, the old address continued to respond to queries. This paper presents an initial investigation of the traffic at both the new and old addresses before, during, and after the change. Our data reveal non-obvious behavior: the overall query volume to the D-roots increased by approximately 50%, the old address continued to receive a high volume of queries months after the change, and a significantly higher number of queries to the old address succeeded compared to the new one. Our analysis provides insights into how compliant resolvers adapt and how non-standard and potentially malicious resolvers react to the IP address change. We provide evidence that a relatively small number of implementation errors account for nearly all discrepancies that are not due to misconfigurations or attacks.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a foundational protocol of the Internet, and fundamental to DNS are its 13 root name servers, responsible for last-resort queries for top-level domains (TLDs). The IP addresses of these root servers are widely disseminated, both out-of-band (via hints files) and in-band (via priming queries, where one root server provides the IP addresses of the others).

The University of Maryland hosts the D-root name server, originally referred to as `terp.umd.edu` (TERP). TERP has always been a root nameserver, with an early IP address of `128.8.10.90`, appearing in BIND 4.2.1 in 1989. To support a robust anycasted service for "critical infrastructure," ICANN and ARIN have allocated several /24 IPv4 (and /30 IPv6) address blocks to different organizations. Under this policy, the `199.7.91/24` block was allocated to the University of Maryland, and the D-root server address was changed from `128.8.10.90` to `199.7.91.13`. The new /24 IPv4 block will be anycasted globally.

Though root servers rarely change their IP addresses (historically, at most once each, to permit anycast addressing), there are some well-known phenomena that occur when they do. Specifically, overall query volume increases, and queries persist at the old IP address, seemingly indefinitely. However, there remains no clear explanation for these phenomena. This paper presents and analyzes data collected before, during, and for several months after the D-root's address change. With these data, we observe the same phenomena as in prior measurements at other root servers and identify a new one: widely differing query success rates between the old and new addresses. We identify potential root causes for the increase in query volume and explain persistent queries to the old address. We conclude that changing a root name server's IP address can help identify bugs, misconfigurations, and attacks, and suggest that such changes should be a periodic, crude means of garbage collection.

## 2. Background and Related Work
In DNS, root name servers serve the "root zone," which lies at the top of the namespace hierarchy. Each root name server provides authoritative answers to queries regarding root zone records. For all other queries, they provide pointers to the authoritative name servers for the top-level domain (TLD) (e.g., `.com` or `.edu`).

The DNS protocol supports a maximum of 13 root name server addresses due to its original design constraint limiting UDP responses to 512 bytes. As the Internet grew, these servers became under-provisioned to handle the large number of queries. Anycasting was suggested as a means to distribute the root name server instances across a large number of global replicas without patching the existing protocol.

### DNS Root Server Traffic Analysis
Prior analyses of traffic at DNS root name servers have identified significant levels of malformed or invalid queries. A 2008 study by Castro et al. found that only 1.8% of the traffic arriving at 8 of the 13 root name servers was valid. These results validate and expand upon a 2003 study by Wessels and Fomenkov, which discovered only 2.15% legitimate traffic at F-root. These prior studies focus on steady-state behavior, whereas we study a rare event; however, if DNS resolvers transition to the new address as intended, we expect the steady-state behavior at the new address to mimic the old.

D-root is not the first root server to be measured during an IP address change. Barber et al. measured the J-root address change, and Manning presented an overview of B-root. Both initiatives reported significant, prolonged levels of traffic at the old IP address, even two years after the change, despite the fact that root name server records have limited TTLs (currently 41 days for A records and 6 days for NS records). To determine the various software versions for the resolvers that appeared to be acting incorrectly, both the B- and J-root studies used the `fpdns` fingerprinting tool. Newer resolver software versions (e.g., BIND9) appeared incorrect despite having implemented mechanisms to handle these IP address changes.

Nonetheless, the root cause behind this behavior has remained undetermined. While it is generally known that an increase in volume is imminent, there is surprisingly little insight into why. In this paper, we initiate a thorough analysis of D-root's address change and identify what we believe to be the major root causes behind this and other anomalies.

## 3. Data Collection and Overview
In this section, we describe the data we collected and identify three anomalies that drive our initial measurement analysis.

### 3.1 Data Collection
The new address is hosted on a new interface on the same physical host as the old address. We port-mirrored both interfaces and collected two datasets. The first consists of full-payload packet captures using `tcpdump` on the aggregate traffic to both the new and old IP addresses. Unfortunately, the traffic volume (approximately 20,000 queries per second on average) is too high to allow us to capture all packets. 

| Queries (×10³) | Total | Invalid TLD | Malformed | Underscore | RFC1918 PTR | Non-Print Char | A-for-A | Invalid Class |
|----------------|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| **01/02 00:00 - 01/03 09:53** | | | | | | | | |
| Old | 897 | 0.6 | 1.0 | 0.2 | 0 | 0 | 1,690,311 | 655,732 |
| New | 199 | 3,934 | 2,529 | 272 | 117 | 6 | 4 | |
| **01/03 09:53 - 01/09 17:11** | | | | | | | | |
| Old | 5,229,920 | 1,613,107 | 6,802 | 9,107 | 985 | 94 | 39 | 19 |
| New | 6,547,199 | 4,918,226 | 9,104 | 1,755 | 168 | 28 | 143 | 29 |
