When working with audio, scalar time series, or 1D signals of shape `T` or `BxT`, the current practice involves unsqueezing the data to at least a 3D tensor and then squeezing it back to its original dimensions. Given that PyTorch is now widely used for a variety of applications beyond just image processing, it would be highly beneficial to have native support for 1D signals. This would streamline the workflow and enhance usability for tasks involving 1D data.
