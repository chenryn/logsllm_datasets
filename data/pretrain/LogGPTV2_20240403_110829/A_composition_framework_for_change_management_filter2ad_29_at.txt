2.1  Introduction 
This section provides the OCM Practitioner with a side-by-side view of project 
management processes from the CA-PMF and BPR activities from the CA-BPR 
that typically occur during the same process phase. Additional OCM resources, 
including  the  Prosci®  ADKAR®  model,  are  provided  for  the  reader  to  further 
explore OCM concepts. 
2.2  CA-OCM Activities in 
Relation to the CA-PMF  
and the CA-BPR 
As  detailed  in  the  CA-OCM  process  phase  chapters,  OCM  is  not  performed 
in  isolation,  but  rather  depends  heavily  on  strong  coordination  with  other 
project workstreams. Two important workstreams are project management, as 
described in the CA-PMF, and BPR, as described in the CA-BPR. 
Figure 2-1 provides an at-a-glance view of each high-level activity (or process, as 
is the case with the CA-PMF) by process phase for each workstream and relates 
the  activities  of  the  CA-OCM  with  activities  of  the  CA-BPR  and  processes  of 
the CA-PMF.

2.3  OCM Resources 
OCM  is  a  growing  practice  and  has  received  increased  attention  as  a  critical 
factor  to  project  success,  because  it  increases  the  rate  of  adoption  and 
utilization. A number of OCM resources exist that discuss the many facets of 
managing  change.  Many  of  these  resources  have  common  threads,  such  as 
managing  resistance  and  garnering  stakeholder  enrollment,  and  they  may 
provide  diferent  perspectives  for  the  OCM  Practitioner  to  create  a  nuanced 
approach on their project. The following sources provide additional reference 
material and illustrate various approaches that may be helpful. 
2.3.1 Resources 
The  Prosci®  ADKAR®  Model  –  ADKAR®  is  a  widely-recognized  change 
management  model  that  focuses  on  elements  that  afect  change  at  the 
individual-level. These elements, which make up the ADKAR® acronym include: 
•  Awareness (of the need for change) 
•  Desire (to support the change) 
•  Knowledge (of how to change) 
•  Ability (to demonstrate new skills and behaviors) 
•  Reinforcement (to make the change stick) 
When applied to organizational change, this model allows leaders and change 
management  teams  to  focus  their  activities  on  what  will  drive  individual 
change and therefore achieve organizational results. The Prosci® ADKAR® Model 
provides clear goals and outcomes for change management activities. It also 
provides  a  simple,  easy-to-use  framework  for  everyone  in  the  organization 
to think about change. Employees, managers and senior leaders alike can all 
use ADKAR® to describe and discuss change together. For more information on 
ADKAR® and Prosci, visit: www.prosci.com. 
Change Management Institute (CMI) – The CMI is a global, independent, and 
not-for-profit  organization  set  up  to  promote  and  develop  the  profession  of 
change management internationally. For more information on the CMI, visit: 
www.change-management-institute.com.

Glossary 
California Department of Technology 
Organizational Change Management Framework 
This glossary ofers brief, general descriptions of major OCM roles and terms, 
many  of  which  are  used  or  referenced  in  the  CA-OCM.  This  glossary  is  not 
intended as a comprehensive or definitive compilation of terminology used in 
the profession of OCM. 
The descriptions are drawn from information within the CA-OCM itself, as well 
as  from  highly  regarded  sources  such  as  the  California  Project  Management 
Framework  (CA-PMF),  the  Project  Management  Institute  (PMI),  and  the 
Association of Project Management (APM). 
Understanding OCM roles and terms is vital for OCM success. While these lists 
do not cover all roles and terms, they include common and important ones that 
the OCM Practitioner should know and understand. 
3.1 OCM Role Definitions 
There are many diferent roles, people, groups, and organizations involved in 
various elements of an OCM efort. The following is a list of the diferent types 
of roles that may be involved and their respective definitions or responsibilities. 
BPR  Practitioner  –  The  BPR  Practitioner  is  responsible  for  performing  BPR 
activities during a BPR efort. The BPR Practitioner may lead and manage a team 
of BPR resources including members of the BPR Design Team, Stakeholders, 
and  other  BPR  Practitioners.  The  BPR  Practitioner  executes  activities  during 
all phases of the PMLC, ensuring activities and resulting work products are in 
line with project goals and objectives. The BPR Practitioner coordinates closely 
with the Project Manager on schedule, resources, work plan, and monitoring 
and  controlling  activities  throughout  the  project.  The  BPR  Practitioner  also 
works closely with the OCM Practitioner to provide process-related training and 
communication support to ensure buy-in and adoption of new processes. 
End User – The end user is the person or organization that will use the project’s 
end  product.  End  users  can  be  state  or  local  employees,  or  members  of  the 
public.  There  may  be  several  categories  of  end  users,  such  as  the  public  via 
a  website,  customer  service  call  center  employees,  and  financial  staf.  Each 
category may have specific project-related needs and expectations.

Executive  Leaders  –  Executive  leaders  manage  or  direct  employees  and 
oversee  core  business  activities  such  as  strategic  decision  making,  public 
representation,  accounting  for  the  organization’s  overall  performance,  and 
other activities critical to the organization’s purpose. These leaders ofen have 
authority over project approval, progress, and implementation success. 
Human  Resources  –  Human  Resources  manage  the  human  capital  of  the 
business. Human Resources is usually charged with recruiting, hiring, employee 
retention, and managing benefits. 
Implementation  Manager  –  The  Implementation  Manager  leads  the  project 
implementation efort. This includes monitoring the installation of hardware 
required  for  the  project,  data  conversion,  and  organizational  change 
management for users and others in the sponsoring organization who require 
orientation  for  new  capabilities  or  business  processes.  The  Implementation 
Manager  leads  the  efort  to  plan  implementation  of  the  project’s  new 
functionality, and he or she coordinates with the Business Lead and Technical 
Lead to ensure a smooth implementation. The Implementation Manager owns 
implementation risks and issues. The role also has responsibility for creating 
readiness metrics that allow the Project Manager and Project Sponsor to have a 
clear picture of readiness to implement the new system. 
Key Executive Leaders – See Executive Leaders. 
Key Stakeholders – See Stakeholders. 
OCM Practitioner – The OCM Practitioner is responsible for performing OCM 
activities during an OCM efort. The OCM Practitioner may lead and manage 
a team of OCM resources including members of the OCM Team, Stakeholders, 
and other OCM Practitioners. The OCM Practitioner executes activities during 
all phases of the PMLC, ensuring activities and resulting work products are in 
line with project goals and objectives. The OCM Practitioner coordinates closely 
with the Project Manager on schedule, resources, work plan, and monitoring 
and  controlling  activities  throughout  the  project.  The  OCM  Practitioner  also 
works closely with the BPR Practitioner to provide support for people-related 
Business Process Reengineering (BPR) activities. 
The  OCM  Practitioner  leads  the  planning,  development,  and  executing  of  
project  activities  related  to  preparing  the  sponsoring  organization  and  other  
Stakeholders for changes brought about by a new product or system. This may  
include communication and training on the new system, Stakeholder outreach,  
and other activities required to successfully implement the project’s solution.

Project  Manager  –  The  Project  Manager  is  responsible  and  accountable  for  
successfully executing a project. He or she receives authority from the sponsoring  
organization to execute the project. This authority is documented in the signed  
Project Charter. The Project Manager is responsible for organizing and leading the  
project team that delivers the project goals and accomplishes all of the project  
deliverables. The Project Manager leads the project team through the Concept,  
Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing Process Phases, all while instituting  
monitoring and controlling activities to ensure timely project progress. The Project  
Manager guides project teams to successful completion of each project phase’s  
milestones and deliverables, thereby meeting the goals of the organization. The
