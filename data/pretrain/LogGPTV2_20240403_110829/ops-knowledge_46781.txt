User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题OpenBSD logins via SSH seem to be ignoring my configured radius server I've installed and configured a radius server upon my
localhost - it is delegating auth to a remote LDAP server.

Initially things look good:  I can test via the console:

# export user=skemp
# export pass=xxx
# radtest $user $pass localhost 1812 $secret
Sending Access-Request of id 185 to 127.0.0.1 port 1812
    User-Name = "skemp"
    User-Password = "xxx"
    NAS-IP-Address = 192.168.1.168
    NAS-Port = 1812
rad_recv: Access-Accept packet from host 127.0.0.1 port 1812, id=185,


Similarly I can use the login tool to do the same thing:

bash-4.0# /usr/libexec/auth/login_radius -d -s login $user radius
Password: $pass
authorize


However remote logins via SSH are failing, and so are invokations
of "login" started by root.  Looking at /var/log/radiusd.log I
see no actual log of success/failure which I do see when using either
of the previous tools.

Instead sshd is just logging:

 sshd[23938]: Failed publickey for skemp from 192.168.1.9
 sshd[23938]: Failed keyboard-interactive for skemp from 192.168.1.9 port 36259 ssh2
 sshd[23938]: Failed password for skemp from 192.168.1.9 port 36259 ssh2


In /etc/login.conf I have this:

# Default allowed authentication styles
auth-defaults:auth=radius:

...

radius:\
    :auth=radius:\
    :radius-server=localhost:\
    :radius-port=1812:\
    :radius-timeout=1:\
    :radius-retries=5:

Assistant: I had similar issues with configuring OpenBSD to deligate authentications to a ldap server. The only way I could get it to work was by adding a user to the local db, e.g.

useradd -s /bin/ksh -L ldap new_user

In your case, it would be something like

useradd -s /bin/ksh -L radius new_user2

However, since you have to manually create a user entry for each machine that is using ldap for authentication, it would undermine the need for a centralized ldap authentication server. I am also out of ideas.
