**Version** : 1.184.0  
**OS** : OSX  
**Problem Description** : I am using the quick file/folder add feature when I
use the file explorer right-click functionality to add a new file. When the
dialog appears, if, for any reason, I move away from the app, it disappears.
On OSX, this can be if I switch applications, three-finger swipe away, etc.
Minor, but annoying from a UX perspective.  
**Expected** : With most other dialogs, the dialog stays around despite loss
of focus of the application.
**Steps to Reproduce**
  1. Right click on a folder that is showing in the file navigator.
  2. Chose _New File_
  3. Swipe away/switch away from the app.
  4. Dialog is gone.
