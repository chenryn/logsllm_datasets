Figure 5 and Figure 7 both show a typical plot for LRD traffic. The second-order
scaling starts from a certain scaling point on and continues until the largest available
scale in the trace. For small scales we do not see second-order scaling behavior. We
have found this scaling behavior for all WAP processes.
Figure 6 also exhibits LRD scaling, but actually has two scaling regions. One from
approximately 1 to 8 and one from 8 to maximum scale. This is called bi-scaling. We
have found this in the case of DVP for Web traffic in Vfe2. Figure 8 depicts the case
where the process has second-order scaling over all scales. This indicates strictly sec-
ond-order self-similarity. We see this in the case of PAP for WEB traffic also in Vfe2.

We  point  out  some  interesting  observations  (cf.  Table  1  to  Table  4).  Firstly,  the
Hurst  value  of  the  aggregated  traffic  is  always  very  close  to  the  Hurst  value  of  the
majority of the traffic. This is in agreement with [14]. In the case of Vfe1 the major
part of the traffic is WAP traffic, in the case of Vfe2 it is WEB traffic. More in detail,
even the whole scaling behavior, as depicted by the Logscale Diagram, is very similar
between the majority traffic and the aggregated traffic. This implies, by knowing the
scaling of the majority traffic, one obtains also the scaling of the aggregated traffic.
Secondly,  the  minor  traffic  has  always  slightly  higher  Hurst  values,  with  changing
roles of WAP and WEB in the cases of Vfe1 and Vfe2. We do not have an explana-
tion for this, yet. One reason might be that even so we applied the estimation methods
on separated traces per APN, it is not possible to separate them truly: they have been
both traveling together through the GPRS network, thereby most likely affecting each
other.

Fig.  5.  Typical  plot  for  processes  showing
long  range  dependency.  Below  a  certain
scale  no  regular  linear  scaling  exists.  The
linear  part  is  at  j=8  divided  in  two  scaling
regions
Fig. 6. Typical plot for processes showing bi-
scaling.  The  second  scaling  region  starts  at
j=8. It also implies long range dependence
An  interesting  question  arises  whether  it  is  actually  possible  to  truly  identify  the
Hurst  value  for  each  type  of  traffic  separately.  In  [14]  the  authors  have  shown  that
non-self-similar UDP traffic is affected by self-similar TCP traffic. But this effect is
only strong if the self-similar traffic is the major traffic. In our case we observe high
Hurst values even in the case the WAP (UDP) traffic is dominating. This suggests that
WAP traffic itself is strongly long-range dependent.
Furthermore,  we  see  that  WAP  traffic  has  a  very  different  scaling  behavior  for
small scales compared to WEB traffic. The reason for the different small scaling be-
havior can be assumed to be the very different transport mechanism of TCP and WAP
over UDP. As we explained in the footnote to the Abry-Veitch method, the octave j in
the logscale diagram also expresses the timescale of the aggregated process. Based on
this insight it is possible to determine over which timescales scaling occurs. We start
with an initial bin size of 100 ms, which leads to values of tj=0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6,
3.2, … for j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, … , respectively. For all processes in which we observed a
scaling like the one depicted in Figure 5 and Figure 7, the knee-point at which the lin-
ear scaling starts is at about j=5 or j=6, i.e., respectively 1.6 seconds or 3.2 seconds. In
Searching for Self-similarity in GPRS         91
[16] the authors show that the average download time per WAP page, including em-
bedded objects, is in the order of 1.5-3 seconds. Hence, this timescale marks the de-
marcation line between the WAP transport layer protocol and the user behavior.

Although  there  is  a  step  at  j=9,  the  slope  on

6  Conclusion
Based on live GPRS measurements, we applied 6 different established Hurst estima-
tion methods, including the comprehensive and robust Abry-Veitch test on packet ar-
rival and data volume processes. We showed the Hurst  value  as  well  as  the  scaling
behavior for the busy-hour for 3 different traffic types and two different networks. In
the case of aggregated traffic and also in the case of individual WAP and WEB traffic
traces, the results strongly suggest long-range dependency.
We confirmed that the dominant traffic type (WAP or WEB) determines the degree
of self-similarity of the aggregated traffic. In our case however, the minor traffic al-
ways exhibits a Hurst value larger than the Hurst  value of the  major traffic. This is
particularly interesting as WAP traffic is based on UDP.
We  showed  that  WAP  traffic  has  a  very  different  scaling  behavior  compared  to
WEB traffic for small scales. We identified the demarcation line between small and
larger scales for WAP to coincide with the average page duration. Larger scales can
probably be accounted to user behavior.
As future research we wish to investigate the reason(s) why the minor traffic frac-
tion exhibits higher Hurst parameter values for all tests.
Further research also includes investigating the reason(s) of self-similarity of WAP
traffic and the exact nature of scaling;  whether it is mulitfractional,  monofractional,
strictly self-similar or ‘just’ long-range dependent.
