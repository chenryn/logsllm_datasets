### Title: Security Pitfalls in Cross-Vendor IoT Access Control: How I Can Unlock Your Smart Door

**Abstract:**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to an increasing reliance on cloud-based management systems. These systems, operated by device vendors (e.g., Philips Hue, LIFX, Tuya) or cloud providers (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Alexa, IFTTT), mediate user access to devices, ensuring that only authorized users can, for instance, unlock a door.

A notable trend is the growing capability to delegate device access across different clouds and users. For example, Philips Hue and August Lock allow Google Home to control their devices, enabling users to manage multiple devices from various vendors through a single interface. This functionality can be particularly useful, such as when an Airbnb host temporarily delegates access to a smart lock to a guest during their stay.

However, this cross-cloud delegation introduces a complex and potentially insecure authorization chain. The process is distributed, heterogeneous, and often unverified, with each vendor implementing its own delegation protocols based on ad-hoc and implicit security assumptions. Additionally, the intricate coupling of services across clouds can inadvertently lead to one cloud violating the security operations and assumptions of another.

In this study, we present the first systematic analysis of cross-cloud IoT delegation, leveraging a verification tool we developed. We examined 10 mainstream IoT clouds, including Google Home, SmartThings, IFTTT, Philips Hue, LIFX, and August, and identified five critical vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could potentially affect millions of users and hundreds of vendors, allowing adversaries (such as former employees or Airbnb tenants) to gain unauthorized access to IoT devices like smart locks, switches, and safety sensors.

We successfully implemented end-to-end attacks for all discovered vulnerabilities and reported them to the affected vendors, who have either deployed or scheduled fixes. Furthermore, we propose principles for developing more secure cross-cloud IoT delegation services, providing a foundation for future standardized solutions.
