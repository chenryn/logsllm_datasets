### Traceroute Methods and Destination Lists

#### 1. CAIDA’s Topology Mapping Project, DIMES, and iPlane
CAIDA’s topology mapping project, DIMES, and iPlane all derive destination lists from advertised BGP prefixes. This list is composed of several different lists, and we generated a consistent set of destinations for each vantage point using the following procedure:

1. **Deriving BGP Prefixes:**
   - We merged daily snapshots of 'sh ip bgp' on RouteViews from March 19-25, 2008.
   - To avoid truncated or non-representative tables, we chose the median file size snapshot each day.
   - We extracted IP prefixes from this set using the `straightenRV` tool.

2. **Filtering Anomalous Prefixes:**
   - We found that prefixes appearing in only one or two snapshots tend to be anomalous (e.g., unreachable most of the time).
   - We selected prefixes that appear in at least three snapshots.
   - Of the initial 257,504 base prefixes, 255,981 (99.4%) appeared in at least three snapshots, representing the equivalent of 110.3 /8s.
   - 251,452 prefixes (97.6%) appeared in all seven snapshots.

3. **Dividing the Prefix List:**
   - The list of 255,981 prefixes was divided into two sets:
     - **roots.le16:** All root prefixes (prefixes not enclosed in any other prefix) with a prefix length of 16 or shorter. This set contains 10,000 prefixes covering 89.8 /8s.
     - **prefs.gt16.le24:** Remaining prefixes with lengths greater than 16 and less than or equal to 24. This set represents 240,600 prefixes covering 29.9 /8s.
   - These two sets intentionally overlap in their coverage of the address space.

4. **Creating Custom Destination Lists:**
   - For each vantage point, we created a custom destination list using the following steps:
     - Select one random address in each /16 covered by the set `roots.le16`.
     - Select one random address in each prefix of the set `prefs.gt16.le24`.
     - Never select more than one destination in any /24.
     - Exclude addresses in bogon prefixes [20].
     - Exclude addresses in CAIDA’s do-not-probe list, which consists of 975 prefixes covering the equivalent of 1.14 /8s, largely due to a single /8 on the list.
   - This procedure selects as many destinations in a /16 as there are more specific prefixes for that /16, but never more than one destination per /24. This constraint may allow any possible divergent routing introduced by the more specific prefixes to be captured.
   - This procedure yields 261,530 addresses for each vantage point, with minimal overlap in addresses between vantage points.

#### 2. Alexa Top 500 Websites
The second address list is composed of the top 500 websites as reported by Alexa. We chose this list for the following reasons:
1. The targets are destination hosts reachable on TCP port 80, and as popular web servers, they likely receive traceroute traffic as users troubleshoot connectivity problems.
2. The targets are likely to have a firewall in front of them, allowing us to compare which probing methods are more likely to reach the destination and possibly infer the approximate location of the firewall.
3. The Alexa list is studied in other work [15, 21].

- The actual number of IP addresses included in the website list is 422, as some websites in the top 500 share IP addresses. For example, several top 500 websites hosted by Akamai resolve to the same IP addresses. Similarly, some nationalized instances of Google (e.g., google.co.nz, google.co.uk) and eBay share the same sets of IP addresses, and we include them only once.
- Many of these websites have multiple A records (IP addresses) returned in a single DNS response. In such cases, we add a random address from the returned list not previously included.
- We probed all four addresses returned from an A query to the 58 nationalized instances of Google ranked by Alexa in the top 500 websites. The IP addresses returned by DNS can differ depending on the vantage point. We did all DNS lookups from the same network as the host from which we subsequently performed traceroute measurements. Since we probed this list from a single host, the vantage-point dependency of DNS mappings should not affect our conclusions.

#### 3. Router List
Finally, we probe an address list composed of 2,000 random router IP addresses previously discovered with traceroute. We chose this list because the targets are known to be routers that have recently responded with an ICMP time exceeded message and should therefore be reachable. The objective of probing this list is to determine if any particular traceroute probe method is likely to be more useful when probing destinations that are routers.

### Results

#### 3.1 Random Routable Probing Results

##### 3.1.1 Overall Results
Figure 1 shows the distribution of traceroute halt reasons for all methods per vantage point for the random routable IP address list. The vantage points `cbg-uk` and `nrt-jp` used all six probing methods, while the other six vantage points used three probing methods: UDP-Paris, ICMP-Paris, and TCP traceroute. These six vantage points used a reduced set of methods due to the limited additional utility of the other methods; UDP-Paris DNS reached few additional destinations compared to UDP-Paris, and the traditional UDP and ICMP methods are known to infer false loops at a greater rate due to not maintaining a constant flow identifier between probes [6]. The data collection was staggered between August 6th and 16th, 2008; the collection for the six vantage points that used three probing methods completed in approximately two and a quarter days; the collection for the two vantage points that used six methods completed in approximately twice as much time. Table 4 shows the median rate of halt reason for the three methods which were used on all eight vantage points.

We now examine the results for each halt reason, starting with the lowest bars in Figure 1 and working up:
- **Reached:** The percentage of traces where the destination was considered reached according to the definition in Section 2.2.1. The reachability rate is between 9.0% and 9.4% with the ICMP-Paris method, between 8.2% and 8.7% with the TCP method, and between 5.1% and 5.4% with the UDP-Paris method, depending on the vantage point. The reachability statistics for each method vary an average of 0.4% across vantage points; an earlier data collection varied less than 0.1% when it was collected across all vantage points simultaneously, so we believe that the variation in reachability in this scenario is caused by the variation in when the data was collected.
- **ICMP-Unreach:** The percentage of traces whose halt reason was an ICMP destination unreachable message with a source address not matching the destination address probed. The median percentage across vantage points for this halt reason was 12.7% for ICMP-Paris, 11.7% for TCP, and 11.2% for UDP-Paris. Notably, the rank order of methods for both the reached and ICMP-unreachable cases are the same, indicating that firewalls are less likely to silently discard ICMP probes than they are UDP probes, rendering ICMP-Paris a more productive probing method than UDP-Paris for random destinations.
- **Loop:** The percentage of traces that halted because an IP address appeared for the second time in the same trace and was not a case of zero-ttl forwarding [6]. This halt reason varied more per vantage point than per probe method, consistent with the fact that loops are routing issues independent of probe method. The median rate of observed loops was 6.7% for ICMP-Paris, 6.4% for UDP-Paris, and 6.3% for TCP.
- **GapLimit:** The percentage of traces that probed five consecutive hops and obtained no responses for any. This unreachability is unsurprising given a random destination list, since it is well-established that most IP addresses do not respond to direct probes [22]. As a result of ICMP-Paris more effectively reaching destinations or triggering ICMP destination unreachable messages, the percentage of destinations that result in such unproductive probing is 2.2% more for TCP and 5.7% more for UDP-Paris.

Two of our vantage points, `cbg-uk` and `nrt-jp`, used three further probe methods: traditional ICMP, traditional UDP, and UDP-Paris DNS. UDP-Paris DNS is only slightly more effective than UDP-Paris; from a list of 261,530 addresses, it reaches 311 more destinations from `cbg-uk` and 356 more from `nrt-jp`. This negligible difference surprised us; we had believed that many more operators would configure their firewalls to allow packets with a source port of 53 through without requiring an initial matching request, which would have allowed UDP-Paris DNS through while blocking UDP-Paris, but this data does not support our initial hypothesis. It could be possible that firewalls are configured to drop probes to the traditional traceroute port range while permitting other packets with a source port value of 53.

Our other two probe methods were the traditional UDP and ICMP techniques, which do not send probes with a constant flow identifier as Paris traceroute does [6]. Table 5 shows the halt differences between a traditional traceroute technique and the Paris variation for vantage points `cbg-uk` and `nrt-jp`. Our results show that the UDP technique derives a greater reduction than ICMP in the number of loops detected, perhaps due to fewer routers that load balance ICMP packets per flow [15]. The UDP technique also achieves the greatest percentage increase in reached destinations compared to non-Paris probing. However, approximately 80% of the paths that inferred a false loop in the traditional case now halt in the Paris case due to the gaplimit condition being met.

##### 3.1.2 Reachability
We next consider aspects of destination reachability for UDP-Paris, ICMP-Paris, and TCP. We consider these the canonical traceroute methods; their variations do not reach significantly more destinations. Figure 2 shows reachability intersection statistics across each method for all vantage points. The destination reachability statistics are similar for all probe sources, so we choose `cbg-uk` for detailed analysis. In total, 31,439 destinations were reachable from `cbg-uk` by at least one of the three methods, while 32.5% of these were reachable by all methods. The ICMP-Paris technique reached 75.2% of these destinations. Using both TCP and ICMP-Paris methods, 97.7% of the destinations were reached. Put another way, of the 31,439 destinations reached, only 2.3% were reachable solely with the UDP-Paris method. If a goal of Internet topology discovery is to maximize discovery at the edges of the Internet, UDP-Paris is not a good probe method to use compared with the other methods evaluated.

As described in Section 2.2.1, there is more than one way to define a destination as being reached when using traceroute. Table 6 shows replies classed as reaching a destination from `cbg-uk`. At least 95% of the replies from a destination were of the expected type (shown with an asterisk).

| Method | Reached | Expected Type | Prohib Filter | Prohib Host | Unknown Host | Unreach Net | Unreach Host | Unreach Proto | Unreach Port | Echo Reply | Syn-Ack | Rst-Ack | Rst | Other TCP |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------|---------|---------|-----|------------|
| UDP-Paris | 13,411 (5.1%) | 96.0% | 156 | 163 | 0 | 8 | 208 | 1 | 12,875* | – | – | – | – | – |

This table provides a detailed breakdown of the types of replies received, confirming the reliability of the ICMP-Paris and TCP methods over UDP-Paris for reaching destinations.
