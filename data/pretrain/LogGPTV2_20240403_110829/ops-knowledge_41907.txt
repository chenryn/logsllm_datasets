1. **FastLeaderElection Notifications Timeouts:**
   - The `FastLeaderElection` component is experiencing notification timeouts every hour. The timeout duration is set to 60,000 milliseconds (or 60 seconds). These timeouts occur at:
     - 15:36:13
     - 15:51:13
     - 16:02:13
     - 16:11:13
     - 18:02:14
     - 18:04:14
     - 18:41:14
     - 18:47:14

2. **QuorumCnxManager Channel Connection Issues:**
   - The `QuorumCnxManager` component is unable to open channels to two different election addresses:
     - `/10.10.34.12:3888` (referred to as "2" in the logs)
     - `/10.10.34.13:3888` (referred to as "3" in the logs)
   - The specific times when these connection issues occur are:
     - For `/10.10.34.12:3888` (address 2):
       - 15:37:13
       - 15:55:13
       - 15:57:13
       - 16:03:13
       - 16:37:13
       - 17:39:14
       - 18:28:14
       - 18:51:14
     - For `/10.10.34.13:3888` (address 3):
       - 16:12:13
       - 16:51:13
       - 17:29:13
       - 18:31:14

**Summary:**
- The `FastLeaderElection` component is consistently timing out every hour with a 60-second timeout.
- The `QuorumCnxManager` component is repeatedly failing to open channels to the specified election addresses, indicating potential network or configuration issues.

These issues suggest that there may be underlying problems with the network connectivity or the configuration of the election addresses, which need to be investigated and resolved to ensure the system operates correctly.
