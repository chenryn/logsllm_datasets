## Feature request
ðŸ‘‹ I'm a developer who's been working on adding source map support to Node.js
stack traces.
I've noticed that webpack's source maps use special pseudo paths, which look
something like this:
**webpack:///./index.js**
When these source maps are loaded in Node.js, it's difficult to know what path
`./index.js` should be resolved relative to. The specification indictes:
> the sources are resolved relative to the SourceMap (like resolving script
> src in a html document).
Which to me would suggest `dist/index.js`, vs., the sources's actual location
`dist/../index.js`.
**What is the expected behavior?**
It would be nice to be able to read a variable like `sourceRoot`, to determine
the root path of the JavaScript file prior to transpilation.
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**
Folks use webpack to create bundles of Node.js applications that are run
outside of the browser, it would be nice for these people to have accurate
stack traces.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**
When specifying `--target node`, it would be useful if source paths either did
not use the `webpack://` pseudo path, or if the `sourceRoot` variable was
populated ( _populating`sourceRoot` would potentially break other
implementations reading the sourceMap_).
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**
yes
