Fig. 3. Dyadic Block Reshuﬄing. Row of ‘x’: arrival times in original stream. Row of
‘o’: arrival times in transformed stream. Black Boxes: equi-spaced blocks of time. There
are just as many times in each block for each stream. Times in transformed stream are
chosen uniformly at random within block
from de-synchronization; as ﬁgure 4 shows, the two cumulative character counts
functions cross regularly, at least once for each box.

However, the constraint which is responsible for this crossing mechanism –
j,k at scales j ≥ j0 – says also that on suﬃciently coarse scales the two
N 1
counting functions agree, so there are measurable correlations between the two
streams. We are confronted by a tradeoﬀ:
– Pick j0 at ﬁne scale – we get tolerable delay but high correlation
– Pick j0 at coarser scale – we get worse delay but reduced correlation.
Is this tradeoﬀ inevitable? For example, are there local jitterings which are
more cleverly constructed and which avoid such correlations?
We can formulate our central question in the following terms. Let N1(t) be
the cumulative character counting function on the untransformed stream:
N1(t) = # of symbols in Stream 1 on [0, t)
Multiscale Stepping-Stone Detection
25
and similarly let N2(t) be the character counting function on the transformed
stream. Our earlier discussion imposes speciﬁc constraints on these functions:
1. Causality. Characters cannot emerge from the transformed stream before
they have emerged from the original stream. I.e., we must always have:
N2(t) ≤ N1(t).
(The ordering of the inequality here is a convention; we could as well impose
the reverse inequality, since, as discussed above, the direction of the causality
between the two streams depends on the location of the monitor with respect
to the transformation element.)
2. Maximum Tolerable Delay. Per the previous discussion, owing to human
factors characters must emerge from the second stream within a time interval
∆ after they emerged from the ﬁrst stream:
N2(t + ∆) ≥ N1(t).
We then ask:
1. Do Causality & Maximum Tolerable Delay combine to imply no-
ticeable correlations between properties of stream 1 and stream 2?
2. If so, what properties should we measure in order to observe such
correlations?
5 Main Result
Our principal result is a theoretical one, showing that multiscale analysis of
stream functions Ni will reveal, at suﬃciently long time scales, substantial cor-
relations. To make this precise, we introduce a systematic multiscale machinery.
Good references on multiscale analysis and wavelets abound, but we are partic-
ularly fond of [4,5].
To begin, we ﬁx a wavelet ψ(t) which is either a ‘bump’ (like a bell curve)
taking only positive values or a ‘wiggle’ taking both positive and negative values.
See Figure 5 for some examples of each. We form a multiscale family of translates
and dilates of ψ
ψa,b = ψ((t − b)/a)/ap
Here the parameter p controls the kind of analysis we are doing. If ψ is a ‘bump’,
we use p = 1; if ψ is a wiggle, we use p = 1/2. (The rationale for the diﬀerent
choices of p is given in the appendix.)
For computational reasons, we limit ourselves to a special collection of times
and scales: the dyadic family a = 2j, b = k · 2j. We can then use the fast wavelet
transform to rapidly compute the wavelet coeﬃcients of each stream function

When the wavelet is a ‘bump’, these are also called ‘scaling coeﬃcients’; when
the wavelet is a ‘wiggle’ these are commonly called ‘wavelet coeﬃcients’. See
Figure 6.
With this machinery, our central question becomes: if N1 and N2 obey the
causality/maximum tolerable delay constraints, how similar are α1
j,k? In
essence, we are analyzing the character counting functions of both streams across
diﬀerent time scales, looking for how similarly the character arrivals cluster at
each time scale.
j,k and α2
Our analysis follows two speciﬁc branches, depending on the choice of ψ.
– Analysis by Multiscale Block Averages. Here we choose ψ to be a very simple
‘bump’ – actually the “boxcar” function ψ(t) = 1[0,1] depicted in Figure 5,
panel (b). As indicated above, we choose p = 1, and it then turns out that
the coeﬃcients amount to simple averages of the data over blocks of various
lengths and locations. Accordingly, we call this choice of ψ as corresponding
to the analysis of “multiscale block averages.”
We analyze the stream functions Ni(t) via the dyadic boxcar family
ψj,k(t) = ψ((t − k2j)/2j)/2j.
How similar are α1
Our strategy for analysis is to estimate two quantities at each scale level j:

We then compare these, and it will turn out that at long scales the deviation
term is small compared to the typical size. Using analysis developed in the
next section, we can then reach the following conclusions, explained here for
the case of a Poisson input stream, where the analysis is simpler.

– actually the Haar wavelet ψ(t) = 1[1/2,1) − 1[0,1/2) depicted in Figure 5,
panel (a); this is a simple diﬀerence of boxcars. As indicated above, we
therefore choose p = 1/2, and it then turns out that the coeﬃcients amount
to simple scaled diﬀerences of averages of the data over blocks of various
lengths and locations. Accordingly, we call this choice of ψ as corresponding
to the analysis of “multiscale block diﬀerences.”

This simple analytical result indicates, as we have said, that character-
conserving stream transformations which maintain causality and maximum tol-
erable delay, must also maintain correlations between streams at suﬃciently long
time scales.
As stated so far, the result applies just to Poisson input streams. In the
appendix we discuss extending the result to Pareto streams. This extension is of
signiﬁcant practical import, because the Pareto distribution, which as a model
of network keystroke interarrivals is well supported by empirical data [9], is
radically diﬀerent in variability from the exponential distribution.
6 Analysis
In this section we develop some of the machinery used to support the results out-
lined in the previous section. Our ﬁrst analytical tool for developing this result
is a simple application of integration by parts. Let Ψ = Ψ(t) be a function that
is piecewise diﬀerentiable and which vanishes outside a ﬁnite interval. (This con-
dition holds for both the Boxcar and the Haar wavelets). Then from integration
