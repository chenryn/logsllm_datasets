### Dyadic Block Reshuffling

**Figure 3: Dyadic Block Reshuffling**
- **Row of 'x':** Arrival times in the original stream.
- **Row of 'o':** Arrival times in the transformed stream.
- **Black Boxes:** Equi-spaced blocks of time. Each block contains an equal number of arrival times for both streams.
- **Transformed Stream:** Times are chosen uniformly at random within each block.

The reshuffling process ensures that the cumulative character count functions of the two streams cross regularly, as shown in Figure 4, with at least one crossing per block.

  - The figure shows the cumulative character counts for the two streams, indicating regular crossings.

### Constraints and Trade-offs

The constraint responsible for the regular crossings (j, k = N2) also implies that on sufficiently coarse scales, the two counting functions agree, leading to measurable correlations between the two streams. This presents a trade-off:
- **Fine Scale (j0):** Tolerable delay but high correlation.
- **Coarse Scale (j0):** Worse delay but reduced correlation.

**Central Question:**
- Is this trade-off inevitable? Can more cleverly constructed local jitterings avoid such correlations?

### Formulation of the Central Question

Let \( N_1(t) \) be the cumulative character counting function on the untransformed stream:
\[ N_1(t) = \# \text{ of symbols in Stream 1 on } [0, t) \]

Similarly, let \( N_2(t) \) be the character counting function on the transformed stream. The following constraints are imposed:
1. **Causality:** Characters cannot emerge from the transformed stream before they have emerged from the original stream.
   \[ N_2(t) \leq N_1(t) \]
   (The direction of the inequality can be reversed depending on the location of the monitor relative to the transformation element.)

2. **Maximum Tolerable Delay:** Characters must emerge from the second stream within a time interval \( \Delta \) after they emerged from the first stream.
   \[ N_2(t + \Delta) \geq N_1(t) \]

**Questions:**
1. Do causality and maximum tolerable delay combine to imply noticeable correlations between properties of Stream 1 and Stream 2?
2. If so, what properties should we measure to observe such correlations?

### Main Result

Our principal result is a theoretical one, showing that multiscale analysis of stream functions \( N_i \) will reveal substantial correlations at sufficiently long time scales. We introduce a systematic multiscale machinery for this purpose.

**Wavelet Analysis:**
- **Wavelet \( \psi(t) \):** Either a 'bump' (positive values) or a 'wiggle' (both positive and negative values).
- **Multiscale Family:**
  \[ \psi_{a,b} = \frac{\psi\left(\frac{t - b}{a}\right)}{a^p} \]
  - For 'bump': \( p = 1 \)
  - For 'wiggle': \( p = 1/2 \)

**Dyadic Family:**
- \( a = 2^j \), \( b = k \cdot 2^j \)
- Fast wavelet transform to compute wavelet coefficients of each stream function \( N_i \):
  \[ \alpha_{i,j,k} = \langle \psi_{a,b}, N_i \rangle \]

**Analysis by Multiscale Block Averages:**
- **Wavelet:** Boxcar function \( \psi(t) = 1_{[0,1]} \)
- **Coeﬃcients:** Simple averages of data over blocks
- **Strategy:**
  - Estimate typical size of \( \alpha_{1,j,k} \)
  - Estimate maximal deviation of \( \alpha_{1,j,k} - \alpha_{2,j,k} \)

**Poisson Input Stream:**
- \( N_1(t) \) is a Poisson stream at rate \( \lambda \)
- \( \alpha_{1,j,k} \approx \lambda \pm O_P(1/\sqrt{\text{scale}}) \)
- \( |\alpha_{1,j,k} - \alpha_{2,j,k}| \leq O(\log(\text{scale})/\text{scale}) \)
- \( |\alpha_{1,j,k} - \alpha_{2,j,k}| \ll |\alpha_{1,j,k}| \) at long time scales

**Multiscale Block Differences:**
- **Wavelet:** Haar wavelet \( \psi(t) = 1_{[1/2,1)} - 1_{[0,1/2)} \)
- **Coeﬃcients:** Scaled differences of averages of data over blocks
- **Strategy:**
  - Estimate typical size of \( \alpha_{1,j,k} \)
  - Estimate maximal deviation of \( \alpha_{1,j,k} - \alpha_{2,j,k} \)

**Poisson Input Stream:**
- \( N_1(t) \) is a Poisson stream at rate \( \lambda \)
- \( \alpha_{1,j,k} \approx O_P(1/\sqrt{\text{scale}}) \)
- \( |\alpha_{1,j,k} - \alpha_{2,j,k}| \leq O(\log(\text{scale})/\text{scale}) \)
- \( |\alpha_{1,j,k} - \alpha_{2,j,k}| \ll |\alpha_{1,j,k}| \) at long time scales

### Analysis

**Integration by Parts:**
- Let \( \Psi(t) \) be a piecewise differentiable function that vanishes outside a finite interval.
- From integration by parts:
  \[ \int \Psi \, dN_1 - \int \Psi \, dN_2 = -\int \Psi \, d(N_1 - N_2) \]

This simple analytical result indicates that character-conserving stream transformations which maintain causality and maximum tolerable delay must also maintain correlations between streams at sufficiently long time scales. The result is extended to Pareto streams in the appendix, which is significant for practical applications due to the empirical support for the Pareto distribution in network keystroke interarrivals.
