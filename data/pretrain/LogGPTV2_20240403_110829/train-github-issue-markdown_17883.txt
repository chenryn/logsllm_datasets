I found that numpy.sqrt has a strange type mapping:
    >>> numpy.sqrt.types
    ['f->f', 'd->d', 'e->e', 'f->f', 'd->d', 'g->g', 'F->F', 'D->D', 'G->G', 'O->O']
It causes sqrt to upcast float16 to float32. It is also strange that 'f' and
'd' appear twice. Is this definition/behavior intended?  
Note: I checked it with NumPy 1.9.2 on Python 2.7.9 & 3.4.3.
