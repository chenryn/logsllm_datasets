I have observed an unusual type mapping in `numpy.sqrt`:
```python
>>> numpy.sqrt.types
['f->f', 'd->d', 'e->e', 'f->f', 'd->d', 'g->g', 'F->F', 'D->D', 'G->G', 'O->O']
```
This mapping causes `sqrt` to upcast `float16` to `float32`. Additionally, the types 'f' and 'd' appear twice in the list. Is this behavior intentional?

Note: I verified this with NumPy 1.9.2 on Python 2.7.9 and 3.4.3.
