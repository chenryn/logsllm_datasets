User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the spark.CacheManager computing partitions rdd_21_3, rdd_21_2, and rdd_21_0, and the storage.BlockManager finding blocks rdd_2_1, rdd_2_4, rdd_2_3, rdd_2_2, and rdd_2_0 locally. The storage.MemoryStore then stores blocks rdd_21_1, rdd_21_4, rdd_21_3, rdd_21_2, and rdd_21_0 as bytes in memory. Finally, the python.PythonRunner records times for total, boot, init, and finish.
