  * I have verified that the issue exists against the `master` branch of Celery.
## Steps to reproduce
Run a Celery worker with `--pool=solo` option and send it a SIGTERM while
executing a task. By running this script for example.
## Expected behavior
The task should complete before the process stops, like when running without
`--pool=solo`.
## Actual behavior
The worker prints "worker: Warm shutdown (MainProcess)" and immediatly stops.
