User: I'm not sure if this is possible but I want to force my mac to run in 32-bit mode permanently. Currently I've been using this piece of code:
arch -i386 /usr/bin/python
to change it but once I exit python in the terminal it switches back to 64. The reason I want to do this is so I can install pygame. I've already installed it but only in 64-bit mode. I'm not sure if I also need to install it in 32-bit mode for it to work properly. At the moment it says the module does not exist.
Assistant: With the default python install you will get both the 32 and 64 bit versions. The 32 bit version can be called from the terminal with python2.7-32 or python-32.
