**User:**

I am unsure if this is possible, but I would like to force my Mac to run in 32-bit mode permanently. Currently, I have been using the following command to switch to 32-bit mode temporarily:

```bash
arch -i386 /usr/bin/python
```

However, once I exit Python in the terminal, it reverts back to 64-bit mode. My goal is to install Pygame, which I have already installed in 64-bit mode. However, when I try to import it, I get an error stating that the module does not exist. I am not sure if I also need to install Pygame in 32-bit mode for it to work correctly.

**Assistant:**

With the default Python installation on macOS, you should have both 32-bit and 64-bit versions available. To use the 32-bit version, you can call it from the terminal using one of the following commands:

```bash
python2.7-32
```
or
```bash
python-32
```

If these commands are not recognized, it may be because the 32-bit version is not installed or the aliases are not set up. You can check the available Python versions by running:

```bash
ls /usr/bin/python*
```

To ensure that Pygame works in 32-bit mode, you will need to install it specifically for the 32-bit version of Python. You can do this by using the appropriate 32-bit Python interpreter:

```bash
arch -i386 /usr/bin/python2.7 -m pip install pygame
```

This command will install Pygame in the 32-bit environment, and you should be able to import it without any issues.
