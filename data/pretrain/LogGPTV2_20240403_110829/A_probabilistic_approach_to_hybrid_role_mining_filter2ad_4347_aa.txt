ABSTRACT
Role mining algorithms address an important access con-
trol problem: conﬁguring a role-based access control sys-
tem. Given a direct assignment of users to permissions, role
mining discovers a set of roles together with an assignment
of users to roles. The results should closely agree with the
direct assignment. Moreover, the roles should be under-
standable from the business perspective in that they reﬂect
functional roles within the enterprise. This requires hybrid
role mining methods that work with both direct assignments
and business information from the enterprise.
In this paper, we provide statistical measures to analyze
the relevance of diﬀerent kinds of business information for
deﬁning roles. We then present an approach that incor-
porates relevant business information into a probabilistic
model with an associated algorithm for hybrid role mining.
Experiments on actual enterprise data show that our algo-
rithm yields roles that both explain the given user-permission
assignments and are meaningful from the business perspec-
tive.

INTRODUCTION
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [10] is an access con-
trol model used in many systems.
In RBAC, rather than
assigning permissions directly to users, one introduces a set
of roles and deﬁnes two relations: a user-role relation that
assigns users to roles and a role-permission relation that as-
signs roles to permissions. This decomposition facilitates
the administration of authorization policies since roles are
(or should be) natural abstractions of functional roles within

an enterprise and the two relations are conceptually easier to
work with than a direct assignment of users to permissions.
Despite the many advantages of RBAC, it is surprisingly
diﬃcult to conﬁgure and maintain an RBAC system for large
enterprises. This task, called role engineering [6], can be ap-
proached from two diﬀerent directions, top-down or bottom-
up, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
Top-down role engineering [9, 15] starts by analyzing an
enterprise’s business structure. This structure includes busi-
ness information such as the organizational hierarchy, em-
ployees’ job descriptions, or their workplace. This informa-
tion is used to determine the permissions that users should
have and to bundle these permissions into roles. The result-
ing roles are easy to understand from the business perspec-
tive as they are derived from business concepts. However,
the business information alone is unlikely to contain enough
information to derive an RBAC conﬁguration that closely
corresponds to the existing direct assignment of users to per-
missions, i.e., the authorizations may change considerably.
In contrast, bottom-up approaches start with the direct
assignment of users to permissions available, for instance,
as access-control lists. One then analyzes these assignments
for patterns, attempting to capture the underlying structure
with roles and an assignment of users to roles. This analy-
sis can be automated using data mining algorithms and is
called role mining. Interestingly, top-down approaches com-
plement bottom-up methods in terms of their strengths and
weaknesses. Role mining algorithms often achieve a good
ﬁt with the existing user-permission assignments but they
discover roles that are diﬃcult to interpret from a business
perspective and that are cumbersome for administrators to
work with, e.g., to maintain the RBAC conﬁguration as the
enterprise evolves.
In this paper, we propose an approach for hybrid role min-
ing that incorporates top-down business information into a
bottom-up role-mining process and thereby combines the
strengths of both approaches. Our method has two parts,
with associated measures, models, and algorithms.
1. Identify business information and determine its rel-
evance for roles with respect to the existing access-
control data.
2. Incorporate the relevant data into the role mining pro-
cess itself.
In the ﬁrst part, we begin by identifying business infor-
mation that could be relevant for roles. Since roles should
represent functions within an enterprise, the enterprise’s Hu-
man Relations department is likely to be a good source of
101such data, e.g., employees’ positions, working groups, loca-
tions, etc. But not all such data is equally relevant. Indeed,
there is unlikely to be any business information that pre-
cisely captures the roles of all system users. For example,
employees with the same position (group or location) usually
diﬀer in some of their permissions. Moreover, simply using
all available data is not the solution: It not only increases
the computational cost of hybrid role mining, it can actually
lead to worse results, as we will see later (Section 4). Hence
it is necessary to select the most relevant business informa-
tion for use in hybrid role mining. To support this selection,
we deﬁne an appropriate entropy-based notion of relevance
and show how to compute it.
In the second part, we present a method to incorporate
business information into a role mining algorithm based on
a probabilistic model of an RBAC system. Our probabilistic
model encodes how likely it is that a particular role decom-
position underlies a given user-permission assignment. We
combine this model with an objective function on business
information that optimizes business relevance: users with
the same business attribute should ideally be assigned to
the same set of roles.
Our contribution is as follows. First, we develop a method
for quantitatively analyzing any kind of business informa-
tion, establishing a formal notion of relevance that can be
used with any hybrid role mining algorithm. This is the
ﬁrst such method proposed for tackling the data selection
problem in hybrid role mining. Second, we present a hybrid
role mining method based on the combination of a sound
statistical model with an objective function that accounts
for business information. Through experiments, we demon-
strate that our hybrid role mining method ﬁnds roles that
both generalize well and correspond to the business infor-
mation at hand. Finally, we provide two quantitative mea-
sures to objectively assess the results of role mining meth-
ods: a generalization test and an entropy-based measure of
the business relevance of an RBAC system. These measures
are general in that they can be used to assess the results
returned by any role-mining approach.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In
Section 2, we examine related work in role mining. Af-
terwards, in Section 3, we introduce background concepts
before explaining our relevance measure in Section 4.
In
Section 5, we develop our model for hybrid role mining and
the corresponding algorithm. We report on experimental
results obtained with data from a real-world enterprise in
Section 6. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section 7.
2. RELATED WORK
The term role mining was coined by [13] in 2003. Since
then, a number of diﬀerent bottom-up approaches have been
presented, e.g., [3, 11, 19, 20, 22, 23]. In [21], the role min-
ing problem and some of its variants were deﬁned. Almost
all previous approaches are combinatorial, based on diﬀerent
ways of searching through possible roles. Exceptions are [11,
20], which proposed a probabilistic model for RBAC where
bottom-up role mining is recast as the problem of ﬁnding
the most likely roles underlying a given user-permission as-
signment relation. This approach has the feature that role
mining can be used not only to discover roles, but also to
detect exceptional assignments (e.g., assignments needed for
a “special operation”) or even wrong assignments. Follow-
ing this idea, our approach is also based on a probabilistic
model, and, as in [20], we explicitly model the processes
leading to exceptional assignments and wrong assignments.
More importantly, we provide a way to combine our model
with top-down business information.
Several approaches have been previously proposed for top-
down role engineering, all of which are manual.
[17] pro-
posed a method to derive roles by analyzing business pro-
cesses and carried out a case-study on one enterprise as a
proof of principle. Similarly, [15] presented an approach
based on analyzing business scenarios to ﬁnd appropriate
user-role and role-permission assignments. Both approaches
are time consuming for large companies as they require hu-
mans to reason about the business processes or scenarios in
the enterprise. Organizational theory is used to deﬁne cri-
teria for creating roles in [7]. The criteria are based on a
user’s position in the enterprise hierarchy, his job function,
and the resources he requires for his work. As we demon-
strate in this paper, these types of business information can
also be used for automated role engineering.
To the best of our knowledge, there are only two other
approaches to hybrid role mining. In [14], a candidate set
of roles is created using an algorithm from formal concept
analysis [12].
[4] proposes a hybrid approach that extends
the bottom-up algorithm proposed in [3]. It is based on an
algorithm from [1] for association rule mining. Both of these
approaches work by creating a candidate set of roles based
solely on bottom-up data and afterwards using the business
information in a post-processing step to select roles in a
greedy fashion. In contrast, our algorithm uses business in-
formation during the role-creation step. We thereby explore
more of the solution space and ﬁnd solutions that cannot
be reached using a preprocessed set of candidate roles. An-
other diﬀerence is that, in contrast to our approach, [14,
4] both lack a probabilistic model whose parameters are to
be optimized. The outcome is thus determined by design
decisions made for the combinatorial post-processing steps.
Moreover, neither approach provides a way to measure the
relevance of business information for role mining.
3. PRELIMINARIES
Following the RBAC standard [10], we will work with the
following sets in this paper:
• U SERS, the set of users (or employees),
• P ERM S, the set of permissions (or privileges),
• ROLES, the set of roles,
• U A ⊆ U SERS × ROLES, a user-role assignment re-
lation,
• P A ⊆ ROLES × P ERM S, a role-permission assign-
ment relation, and
• U P A ⊆ U SERS×P ERM S, a user-permission assign-
ment relation.
Let N := |U SERS|, D := |P ERM S|, and K := |ROLES|.
We will assume that the sets of users, permissions, and roles
all can be ordered, e.g., we will speak of the ith user, for
i ∈ {1, . . . , N}. The three relations above are all many-to-
many. For notational convenience, we encode each of them
as a binary matrix: We represent U P A as x ∈ {0, 1}N×D,
102U A as z∈{0, 1}N×K , and P A as u∈{0, 1}K×D. In this rep-
resentation, xij = 1 (xij = 0) indicates that user i is (not)
assigned permission j. The representation is analogous for
zik (user i and role k) and ukj (role k and permission j).
The relation P A induces a collection of K sets of permis-
sions, namely those sets of permissions assigned to the same
role k, for each k ∈ {1, . . . , K}. As is often done in practice,
we will identify these sets with the set of roles ROLES. The
indices i, j, and k will be consistently range over U SERS,
P ERM S, and ROLES respectively, throughout the paper
and will often be used synonymously with the objects that
they index.
In bottom-up role mining, the user-permission assignment
matrix x is given and must be approximated with a user-role
relation z and a role-permission relation u. In the approx-
W
imation, the number of diﬀering assignments kx − z ⊗ uk
should be small, where a ⊗ b denotes the Boolean matrix
k [aik ∧ bkj]. Sometimes
product, deﬁned such that cij =
we will refer to the pair (z, u) as the role decomposition of
the direct user-permission assignment x.
Enterprises maintain diﬀerent types of business informa-
tion about each user. Examples include a user’s working
address, job code, organization unit, etc. We encode predi-
cates specifying which users i have the business-information
attribute s (for example, which users work in the accounting
department) as a family of Boolean variables wis. The vari-
able wis has the value of 1 if the user i has attribute s, and
0 otherwise. We shall assume that for each type of business
information, each user has a single attribute s, e.g., a user
is member of exactly one department.
Finally, we use the notation zi· to represent the ith row of
the assignment-matrix z, which encodes the roles possessed
by the user i (note that a user may have more than one role).
The same notation will be used for other matrices as well.
4. ENTROPY-BASED RELEVANCE
MEASURES
An abundance of information is usually available in digital
form within an enterprise, but most of it is ill-suited for
hybrid role mining. To be useful, the data must provide
information about the relationship between employees and
the permissions they have been granted. In this section, we
provide a measure that quantiﬁes to what extent a given
type of business information agrees with the direct user-
permission assignment. When the agreement is high, we say
that the data is relevant because it increases the information
about whether a user has a particular permission.
Business information with too little relevance can actually
lead to worse role mining results. This deterioration occurs
when the objective of agreement between roles and business
information conﬂicts with the objective of ﬁnding roles that
best explain the direct user-permission assignment. This
conﬂict can be avoided by carefully pre-selecting the business
information. The relevance measure we provide can be used
for such a pre-selection.
For the deﬁnition of relevance, we ﬁrst introduce the fol-
lowing quantities. The random variable Xj ∈ {0, 1} denotes
the assignment of permission j to a generic user. S is the
random variable that corresponds to the business attribute
of a generic user (e.g. “job code”) and let s be one of the ac-
tual values that S can take (e.g. “accountant”). Let p(xj) :=
i xij be the empirical probability of j being assigned
1/N ·P
to an unspeciﬁed user, and let p(xj|S = s) := 1/N·P
i xijwis
be the empirical probability of j being assigned to a user
with business attribute s. The natural measure for the in-
formation of a random variable A is its entropy H(A) [5],
which in the case of a permission j is the binary entropy
h(Xj). The binary entropy, deﬁned as
X
xj∈{0,1}
h(Xj) := −
p(xj) log2 (p(xj)) ,
(1)
quantiﬁes the missing information on whether the permis-
sion j is granted to some user. The conditional entropy
p(xj|S = s) log2 (p(xj|S = s))
h(Xj|S) :=−
p(s)
X
X
s∈S
xj∈{0,1}
(2)
encodes how much of the missing information h(Xj) of Xj
remains if S is known. The mutual information
I(Xj; S) := h(Xj) − h(Xj|S)
(3)
measures how much the knowledge of S increases the infor-
mation on Xj. We therefore propose the mutual information
I(Xj; S) to measure how much the knowledge of the busi-
ness information S helps us to predict the assignment xj of
permission j to a generic user. In order to express this ab-
solute reduction of missing information in a relative way, we
deﬁne the measure of relevance ρj(S) of business informa-
tion S for permission j to be the relative mutual information
([5], p. 45)
ρj(S) :=
I(Xj; S)
h(Xj)
= 1 − h(Xj|S)
h(Xj)
.
(4)
This number can be interpreted as the fraction of all bits in
Xj that are shared with S. Alternatively, ρj(S) can be read
as the fraction missing information on permission j that is
removed by the knowledge of S.
For each kind of business information S that appears po-
tentially useful for role mining, one can now compute ρj(S)
for all permissions j and examine their distribution (e.g.
Fig. 2). The larger the overall decrease in entropy of the
permissions under the knowledge of the business informa-
tion S, the better qualiﬁed S is as a candidate for hybrid
role mining. Given diﬀerent types of business information
that are expected to be helpful for role mining, one can com-
pare them and their combinations according to the proposed
measure and pick the most relevant one.
In principle, this relevance analysis can be carried out
