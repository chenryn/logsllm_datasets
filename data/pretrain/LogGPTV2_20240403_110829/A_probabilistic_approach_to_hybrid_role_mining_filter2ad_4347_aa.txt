**Abstract:**
Role mining algorithms are crucial for configuring role-based access control (RBAC) systems. Given a direct assignment of users to permissions, role mining aims to discover a set of roles and an assignment of users to these roles that closely match the initial assignments. Additionally, the discovered roles should be understandable from a business perspective, reflecting functional roles within the enterprise. This necessitates hybrid role mining methods that integrate both direct assignments and business information.

In this paper, we introduce statistical measures to analyze the relevance of different types of business information for defining roles. We then present a probabilistic model and an associated algorithm for hybrid role mining that incorporates relevant business information. Experiments on real-world enterprise data demonstrate that our algorithm generates roles that both explain the given user-permission assignments and are meaningful from a business perspective.

## 1. Introduction

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used access control model. In RBAC, permissions are not directly assigned to users; instead, a set of roles is defined, and two relations are established: a user-role relation and a role-permission relation. This decomposition simplifies the administration of authorization policies by abstracting functional roles within an enterprise.

Despite its advantages, configuring and maintaining an RBAC system for large enterprises is challenging. This task, known as role engineering, can be approached top-down or bottom-up, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Top-down role engineering starts with an analysis of the enterprise's business structure, including organizational hierarchies, job descriptions, and work locations. This information is used to determine and bundle permissions into roles. While the resulting roles are easy to understand from a business perspective, they may not closely match the existing user-permission assignments.

Bottom-up approaches, on the other hand, start with the direct user-permission assignments and use data mining algorithms to identify patterns and roles. These methods often achieve a good fit with the existing assignments but may produce roles that are difficult to interpret and manage from a business perspective.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid role mining approach that combines top-down business information with bottom-up role mining. Our method has two main parts:
1. Identify and evaluate the relevance of business information for roles.
2. Incorporate the relevant business information into the role mining process.

In the first part, we define an entropy-based measure of relevance to select the most pertinent business information. In the second part, we present a probabilistic model and an algorithm that integrates this information into the role mining process.

Our contributions include:
- A method for quantitatively analyzing business information and establishing a formal notion of relevance.
- A hybrid role mining method based on a probabilistic model that optimizes business relevance.
- Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
- Two quantitative measures to assess the results of role mining: a generalization test and an entropy-based measure of business relevance.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 introduces background concepts. Section 4 explains our relevance measure. Section 5 develops our model and algorithm. Section 6 presents experimental results. Finally, Section 7 draws conclusions.

## 2. Related Work

The term "role mining" was introduced in 2003 [13]. Since then, various bottom-up approaches have been proposed, such as [3, 11, 19, 20, 22, 23]. The role mining problem and its variants were defined in [21]. Most previous approaches are combinatorial, searching through possible roles. Exceptions include [11, 20], which proposed a probabilistic model for RBAC, recasting role mining as finding the most likely roles underlying a given user-permission assignment. This approach can also detect exceptional or incorrect assignments. Our approach builds on this idea, using a probabilistic model and explicitly modeling exceptional and wrong assignments.

Several top-down role engineering approaches have been proposed, all manual. [17] derived roles by analyzing business processes, and [15] used business scenarios to find appropriate user-role and role-permission assignments. These methods are time-consuming for large companies. Organizational theory has also been used to define criteria for creating roles [7].

To our knowledge, there are only two other hybrid role mining approaches. [14] uses formal concept analysis to create a candidate set of roles, and [4] extends a bottom-up algorithm with business information in a post-processing step. Both methods lack a probabilistic model and do not provide a way to measure the relevance of business information.

## 3. Preliminaries

Following the RBAC standard [10], we define the following sets:
- **U SERS**: Set of users (or employees).
- **P ERM S**: Set of permissions (or privileges).
- **ROLES**: Set of roles.
- **U A ⊆ U SERS × ROLES**: User-role assignment relation.
- **P A ⊆ ROLES × P ERM S**: Role-permission assignment relation.
- **U P A ⊆ U SERS × P ERM S**: User-permission assignment relation.

Let \( N := |U SERS| \), \( D := |P ERM S| \), and \( K := |ROLES| \). We assume the sets can be ordered, e.g., the \( i \)-th user for \( i \in \{1, \ldots, N\} \). The relations are many-to-many and can be represented as binary matrices:
- **U P A** as \( x \in \{0, 1\}^{N \times D} \),
- **U A** as \( z \in \{0, 1\}^{N \times K} \),
- **P A** as \( u \in \{0, 1\}^{K \times D} \).

In bottom-up role mining, the user-permission assignment matrix \( x \) is given, and the goal is to approximate it with a user-role relation \( z \) and a role-permission relation \( u \). The approximation should minimize the number of differing assignments \( \|x - z \otimes u\| \), where \( \otimes \) denotes the Boolean matrix product.

Enterprises maintain various types of business information about each user, such as working address, job code, and organization unit. We encode this information as a family of Boolean variables \( w_{is} \), where \( w_{is} = 1 \) if user \( i \) has attribute \( s \), and 0 otherwise. We assume each user has a single attribute for each type of business information.

Finally, we use the notation \( z_{i\cdot} \) to represent the \( i \)-th row of the assignment matrix \( z \), which encodes the roles possessed by user \( i \). The same notation applies to other matrices.

## 4. Entropy-Based Relevance Measures

An abundance of digital information is available within an enterprise, but not all of it is suitable for hybrid role mining. To be useful, the data must provide information about the relationship between employees and their permissions. We introduce a measure to quantify the extent to which a given type of business information agrees with the direct user-permission assignment.

Business information with low relevance can lead to worse role mining results. This occurs when the objective of aligning roles with business information conflicts with the objective of explaining the direct user-permission assignment. Careful pre-selection of business information can avoid this conflict.

We define the following quantities:
- **Xj ∈ {0, 1}**: Random variable denoting the assignment of permission \( j \) to a generic user.
- **S**: Random variable corresponding to the business attribute of a generic user.
- **s**: One of the actual values that \( S \) can take.
- **p(xj)**: Empirical probability of permission \( j \) being assigned to an unspecified user.
- **p(xj|S = s)**: Empirical probability of permission \( j \) being assigned to a user with business attribute \( s \).

The natural measure for the information of a random variable \( A \) is its entropy \( H(A) \). For a permission \( j \), the binary entropy is:
\[ h(X_j) := - \sum_{x_j \in \{0, 1\}} p(x_j) \log_2(p(x_j)) \]

The conditional entropy is:
\[ h(X_j|S) := - \sum_{s \in S} \sum_{x_j \in \{0, 1\}} p(s) p(x_j|S = s) \log_2(p(x_j|S = s)) \]

The mutual information is:
\[ I(X_j; S) := h(X_j) - h(X_j|S) \]

We propose the mutual information \( I(X_j; S) \) to measure how much the knowledge of business information \( S \) helps predict the assignment \( x_j \) of permission \( j \). To express this reduction in a relative way, we define the measure of relevance \( \rho_j(S) \) as:
\[ \rho_j(S) := \frac{I(X_j; S)}{h(X_j)} = 1 - \frac{h(X_j|S)}{h(X_j)} \]

This number represents the fraction of all bits in \( X_j \) that are shared with \( S \). For each type of business information \( S \), one can compute \( \rho_j(S) \) for all permissions \( j \) and examine their distribution. The larger the overall decrease in entropy of the permissions under the knowledge of \( S \), the better qualified \( S \) is for hybrid role mining.

In principle, this relevance analysis can be carried out for different types of business information, and the most relevant one can be selected for hybrid role mining.
