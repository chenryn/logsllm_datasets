User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Get cron to send html-formatted emails I have a stats program which runs on log files via cron.  The stats program can output HTML.

Right now I rely on the MAIL_TO mechanism in the crontab.

MAILTO=my@email.addr
55 23 * * * /usr/bin/htmlstats


The problem is that I want the email sent to display as HTML and not as plain text.

Cron places the following header in the email:

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"


Any idea how I would change this to:

Content-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8"

Assistant: I put the CONTENT_TYPE="text/plain; charset=utf-8" in /etc/crontab to have my mail in UTF-8.

Put CONTENT_TYPE="text/html; charset=utf-8" in /etc/crontab to send the mail in HTML.

You may add it in specific file if the directory /etc/cron.d/ exists. In this case, the specification is defined only for the requested tasks.
