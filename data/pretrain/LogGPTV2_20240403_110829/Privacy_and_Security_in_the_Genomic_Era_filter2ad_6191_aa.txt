## Abstract

Advancements in genome sequencing technology have made it possible to generate highly detailed genotypes at a low cost. The collection and analysis of such data support various applications, including personalized medical services. While the biomedical community celebrates the benefits of this genomic revolution, the increased availability of such data raises significant privacy concerns. These concerns stem from the unique features of genomic data, including its association with specific diseases, identification capabilities (e.g., in forensics), and the revelation of family relationships. Additionally, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the likelihood that genomic data will be shared in less regulated environments, such as the Internet and for-profit companies. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the privacy and security challenges associated with genomic data for the computer science community. We address common misconceptions in the field, present the results of a survey conducted with biomedical specialists, and review the state-of-the-art in privacy attacks and mitigation strategies. We also contextualize these issues from the perspectives of medicine and public policy, and conclude by outlining the challenges for genomic data privacy and presenting a framework for analyzing threats and designing countermeasures.

## 1. Introduction

The genomic era began with the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) in 2003 [Guttmacher and Collins, 2003]. Since then, genome sequencing technology has advanced rapidly, coinciding with the rise of affordable computing and communication technologies. This progress has enabled the collection, storage, processing, and sharing of genomic data in ways that were previously unimaginable. As the use of genomic data expands, so do concerns about its security and privacy. Efforts to provide technical protections have been met with demonstrations of vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for further research. This paper provides an overview and systematization of the work done in the last decade and offers a framework to guide future efforts.

### Context and Historical Background

The idea of sequencing the human genome was first proposed in the early 1990s. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiated the first whole genome sequencing project in 1990, and the first complete sequence was released 13 years later at a total cost of $3 billion. However, sequencing technology has since evolved, and costs have plummeted. Today, a whole genome sequence can be obtained for around $6,000 and completed in just two to three days. The "1,000 dollar genome in one day" is expected to become a reality soon.

### Applications and Implications

The decreasing costs of sequencing have driven the expansion of genomics as a research discipline with numerous application possibilities. Genomic data is increasingly used in healthcare (e.g., personalized medicine), biomedical research (e.g., discovery of novel genome-phenome associations), direct-to-consumer (DTC) services (e.g., disease risk tests), and forensics (e.g., criminal investigations). For example, physicians can now prescribe the "right drug at the right time" based on a patient's genomic makeup [Bielinski et al., 2014; Overby et al., 2010; Gottesman et al., 2013a; Pulley et al., 2012].

While some view genomic data as no different from traditional health data, it has unique features that make it distinct and require careful handling. These features include its association with specific diseases, its identification capabilities, and its ability to reveal family relationships. The privacy issues associated with genomic data are complex, particularly because the data provides information beyond the individual from which it was derived. Moreover, the rapid pace of new discoveries about the genome adds to the complexity of managing it as a personal asset or public good.

### Survey and Expert Opinions

We conducted a survey with 61 biomedical researchers to gather their perspectives on the importance of genomic data privacy and security. The results of this survey, along with a comprehensive literature review, form the basis of our analysis.

### Contributions

The main contributions of this paper are:
- An extensive literature survey of both computer science and medical literature on genome privacy.
- Results from an expert survey (opinion poll) with biomedical specialists on their views regarding the security and privacy of genomic data.
- Development of an end-to-end framework for the security and privacy of genomic data in various contexts, including healthcare, biomedical research, legal, and forensics.
- Presentation of what we believe to be the first document reflecting the opinions of computer science, medical, and legal researchers on this important topic.
- An online tutorial providing definitions of technical terms used in this and other papers on the security and privacy of genomic data.

## 2. Essential Features of Genomic Data

To illustrate the essential features of genomic data, consider the following scenario:

Alice decides to have her genome sequenced by a service called MyGenome.com. The service keeps her data in a repository and provides her with information over time. Initially, Alice uses the data to explore her family tree and contribute to medical research on diseases of her choosing. Years later, she experiences health problems and visits a doctor who uses her genomic data to diagnose a likely cause and customize a treatment. Alice is impressed but also concerned about the potential for her data to be shared in ways she did not expect, such as revealing her high risk of dementia.

This scenario highlights several key features of genomic data:
- **Static and Long-lived Value:** Genomic data changes little over a lifetime and may have value that lasts for decades. While sequencing techniques improve over time, the core data remains relatively stable.
- **Kinship Inference:** Genomic data can be used to infer kinship relations, making it useful for genealogy services and forensic applications.
- **Health and Behavioral Diagnostics:** Genomic data can indicate increased likelihoods for certain conditions, such as macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. This has both diagnostic and privacy implications.
- **Special Status and Mystique:** Genomic data has a special status, often viewed as "exceptional" due to its unique features and the potential for both positive and negative impacts.

## 3. Uses of Genomic Data

An individual's genomic sequence contains over 3 billion base pairs, distributed across twenty-three chromosomes. Despite the small differences (estimated at no more than 0.5% between individuals), these variations influence health status and other aspects. This section reviews major applications of genomic data in practice and under development.

### Healthcare

Mutations in an individual's genomic sequence can significantly impact their well-being. Some mutations can lead to immediate or future health issues, following the "one gene, one disease" (OGOD) model [Botstein and Risch, 2003]. Personalized medicine leverages genomic data to tailor treatments, such as prescribing the "right drug at the right time" based on a patient's genomic profile.

### Biomedical Research

Genomic data is crucial for discovering novel genome-phenome associations, which can lead to the development of new treatments and therapies. Researchers use large datasets to identify genetic markers associated with specific diseases, advancing our understanding of genetic influences on health.

### Direct-to-Consumer Services

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) services, such as Ancestry.com and 23andMe, offer genetic testing and analysis directly to consumers. These services provide insights into ancestry, health risks, and other genetic traits, but they also raise privacy concerns due to the less regulated nature of the data sharing.

### Forensics

In forensics, genomic data is used for identification purposes, such as in criminal investigations. The unique nature of DNA makes it a powerful tool for linking individuals to crime scenes, but it also raises ethical and privacy issues.

## 4. Relevance of Genome Privacy

The privacy issues associated with genomic data are multifaceted and complex. The data's long-lasting value, identification capabilities, and potential for revealing sensitive information make it a target for misuse. Additionally, the rapid pace of new discoveries about the genome means that the full implications of sharing genomic data are not yet fully understood. Therefore, ensuring the privacy and security of genomic data is a critical challenge that requires a multidisciplinary approach.

## 5. Survey Findings

We conducted a survey with 61 biomedical researchers to gather their perspectives on the importance of genomic data privacy and security. The survey results revealed a strong consensus among experts that genomic data should be handled with care and that there is a need for robust technical, ethical, and legal frameworks to protect it.

## 6. Literature Review: Privacy Risks

This section summarizes the current state of research on privacy risks associated with genomic data. We review the various types of privacy attacks that have been demonstrated, including re-identification attacks, inference attacks, and linkage attacks. These attacks exploit the unique features of genomic data to compromise individual privacy.

## 7. Literature Review: Mitigation Strategies

In response to the identified privacy risks, researchers have developed various strategies to mitigate these threats. These strategies include access control mechanisms, data anonymization techniques, and cryptographic methods. We review the state-of-the-art in each of these areas and discuss their effectiveness and limitations.

## 8. Challenges for Genomic Medicine and Privacy

Despite the progress made in addressing privacy and security issues, several challenges remain. These include the need for more robust technical solutions, the development of clear ethical and legal guidelines, and the need for greater public awareness and education about the risks and benefits of genomic data. Addressing these challenges will require collaboration across multiple disciplines, including computer science, medicine, and public policy.

## 9. Framework for Privacy-Preserving Handling of Genomic Data

Based on our analysis, we propose a general framework for the privacy-preserving handling of genomic data. This framework includes an extensive threat model that identifies the types of attacks that are possible at each step of the data flow. We also outline a set of best practices and technical solutions that can be implemented to mitigate these threats. The framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, including healthcare, biomedical research, legal, and forensics.

## 10. Conclusion

The genomic era has brought unprecedented opportunities for advancing healthcare and biomedical research, but it has also raised significant privacy and security challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of these challenges and presents a framework for addressing them. By bringing together the perspectives of computer scientists, medical professionals, and legal experts, we aim to foster a more secure and responsible use of genomic data in the future.
