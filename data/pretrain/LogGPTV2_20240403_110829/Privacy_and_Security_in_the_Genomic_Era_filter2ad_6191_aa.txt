Abstract
Genome sequencing technology has advanced at a rapid pace and it
is now possible to generate highly-detailed genotypes inexpensively. The
collection and analysis of such data has the potential to support various
applications, including personalized medical services. While the beneﬁts
of the genomics revolution are trumpeted by the biomedical community,
the increased availability of such data has major implications for personal
privacy; notably because the genome has certain essential features, which
include (but are not limited to) (i) an association with certain diseases,
(ii) identiﬁcation capability (e.g., forensics), and (iii) revelation of family
relationships. Moreover, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the
likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulated envi-
ronments, such as the Internet and for-proﬁt companies. The problem of
genome data privacy thus resides at the crossroads of computer science,
medicine, and public policy. While the computer scientists have addressed
data privacy for various data types, there has been less attention dedicated
to genomic data. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide a systemati-
zation of knowledge for the computer science community.
In doing so,
we address some of the (sometimes erroneous) beliefs of this ﬁeld and we
report on a survey we conducted about genome data privacy with biomed-
ical specialists. Then, after characterizing the genome privacy problem,
we review the state-of-the-art regarding privacy attacks on genomic data
and strategies for mitigating such attacks, as well as contextualizing these
attacks from the perspective of medicine and public policy. This paper
concludes with an enumeration of the challenges for genome data privacy
and presents a framework to systematize the analysis of threats and the
design of countermeasures as the ﬁeld moves forward.

Introduction
I
The genomic era began with the announcement ten years ago that the Human
Genome Project (HGP) had completed its goals [Guttmacher and Collins, 2003].
The technology associated with genome sequencing has progressed at a rapid
pace, and this has coincided with the rise of cheap computing and communica-
tion technologies. Consequentially, it is now possible to collect, store, process,
and share genomic data in a manner that was unthinkable at the advent of
the HGP. In parallel with this trend there has been signiﬁcant progress on un-
derstanding and using genomic data that fuels a rising hunger to broaden the
number of individuals who make use of their genomes and to support research
to expand the ways in which genomes can be used. This rise in the availabil-
ity and use of genomic data has lead to many concerns about its security and
privacy. These concerns have been addressed with eﬀorts to provide techni-
cal protections and a corresponding series of demonstrations of vulnerabilities.
Given that much more research is needed and expected in this area, this seems
like a good point to overview and systematize what has been done in the last
decade and provide ideas on a framework to aid future eﬀorts.
To provide context, consider that it was not until the early 1990s when
sequencing the human genome was posited as a scientiﬁc endeavor. The ﬁrst
attempt for whole genome sequencing 1 (a laboratory process that maps the full
DNA sequence of an individual’s genome) was initiated at the U.S. National
Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1990 and the ﬁrst full sequence was released 13
years later at a total cost of $3 billion. Yet, sequencing technology has evolved
and costs have plummeted, such that the price for a whole genome sequence is
currently $6K2 and can be completed in two to three days. The “$1K genome
in 1 day” will soon be a reality.
Decreases in sequencing costs have coincided with an escalation in genomics
as a research discipline with explicit application possibilities. Genomic data
is increasingly incorporated in a variety of domains, including healthcare (e.g.,
personalized medicine), biomedical research (e.g., discovery of novel genome-
phenome associations), direct-to-consumer (DTC) services (e.g., disease risk
tests), and forensics (e.g., criminal investigations). For example, it is now pos-
sible for physicians to prescribe the “right drug at the right time” (for certain
drugs) according to the makeup of their patients’ genome [Bielinski et al., 2014;
Overby et al., 2010; Gottesman et al., 2013a; Pulley et al., 2012].
To some people, genomic data is considered (and treated) no diﬀerent than
traditional health data (such as what might be recorded in one’s medical record)
or any other type of data more generally [Bains, 2010; Rothstein, 2005]. While
genomic data may not be “exceptional” in its own right, it has many features
that distinguish it (discussed in depth in the following section) and there is a
common belief that it should be handled (e.g., that is stored, processed, and
1In this study, we refer to the process of obtaining the Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) or
the Whole Exome Sequence (WES) as sequencing and the process of obtaining the variants
(usually only single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) as genotyping.

managed) with care. The privacy issues associated with genomic data are com-
plex, particularly because such data has a wide range of uses and provides
information on more than just the individual from which the data was derived.
Yet, perhaps most importantly, there is a great fear of the unknown. Every day,
we learn something new about the genome, whether it be knowledge of a new
association with a particular disease or proof against a previously reported as-
sociation. We have yet to discover everything there is from DNA, which makes
it almost impossible to assign exact value, and thus manage DNA as a personal
asset (or public good). So, as the ﬁeld of genomics evolves, so too will the views
on the privacy-sensitivity of genomic data. As this paper progresses, we review
some of the common beliefs revolving around genome privacy. And, in doing,
we report on the results of a survey we conducted with biomedical specialists
regarding their perspective on genomic data privacy issues.
It should be recognized that there exist numerous publications on technical,
ethical, and legal aspects of genomics and privacy. The research in the ﬁeld
covers privacy-preserving handling of genomic data in various environments (as
will be reviewed in this paper). Yet, there are several challenges to ensuring that
genomics and privacy walk hand-in-hand. One of the challenges that computer
scientists face is that these views tend to be focused on one aspect of the problem
in a certain setting with a certain discipline’s perspective. From the perspective
of computer science, there is a need for a complete framework which shows (i)
what type of security and privacy requirements are needed in each step of the
handling of genomic data, (ii) a characterization of the various threat models
that are realized at each step, and (iii) open computational research problems.
By providing such a framework in this paper, we are able to illustrate the
important problems of genomic privacy to computer science researchers working
on security and privacy problems more generally.
Related Surveys and Articles. Privacy issues caused by forensic, medical
and other uses of genomic data have been studied in the past few years [Stajano
et al., 2008; Stajano, 2009; Malin, 2005a; Naveed, 2014; Cristofaro, 2014]. A
recent survey [Erlich and Narayanan, 2013] discusses identity breaches using

we discuss in Sections VI and Section IX of this paper.
In Section IX we
present an end-to-end picture for the handling of genomic data in a variety
of contexts as shown in Figure 9, while [Erlich and Narayanan, 2013] discusses
how access control, data anonymization and cryptographic techniques can be
used to prevent genetic privacy breaches. Moreover, [Erlich and Narayanan,
2013] has been written for a general audience, whereas this paper is meant for
computer scientists (and in particular security and privacy specialists).
Contributions. The main contributions of this paper are:
• We provide an extensive literature survey 3 of computer science as well as
medical literature about genome privacy.
3In this paper, the word “survey” is used to mean literature survey as well as opinion poll,
however, the meaning will be clear from the context.

• We report on the results of an expert survey (opinion poll) we conducted
with biomedical specialists’ regarding their point of view on the security and
privacy of genomic data.
• We develop an end-to-end framework for the security and privacy of genomic
data in a variety of healthcare, biomedical research, legal and forensics and
direct-to-consumer contexts.
• We present what we believe to be the ﬁrst document that reﬂects the opinions
of computer science, medical, and legal researchers for this important topic.
We also provide an online tutorial4 of biology and other related material
to deﬁne technical terms used in this (and other) paper(s) on the security and
privacy of genomic data. The remainder of this SoK is organized as follows.
Section II explains to what extent genomic data is distinct from data in general
and health information in particular. Section III provides an overview of uses
of genomic data for the non-specialist. Section IV emphasizes the relevance of
genome privacy. Section V reports on the ﬁndings of a survey we conducted
with 61 biomedical researchers regarding the importance of genomic data pri-
vacy and security. Sections VI and VII provide literature surveys, where the
former summarizes the problem (i.e., the privacy risk) and the latter summa-
rizes possible solutions. Section VIII summarizes the challenges for genomic
medicine and privacy. Based on this analysis, Section IX oﬀers a general frame-
work for privacy-preserving handling of genomic data, including an extensive
threat model that discusses what type of attacks are possible at each step of the
data ﬂow. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section IX.J.3.
II Essential features of genomic data
Consider the following scenario. Alice decides to have her genome sequenced
by a service called MyGenome.com that keeps her data in a repository and
gives Alice information about it over time. At ﬁrst she uses information from
MyGenome to explore parts of her family tree and contribute her genomic data,
along with some facts about herself, to support medical research on diseases of
her choosing. Many years after MyGenome performed the initial sequencing,
Alice began experiencing health problems for which she visited a doctor who
used her genomic data to help diagnose a likely cause and customize a treat-
ment based on variation in her genome sequence. Alice was impressed by this
experience and wondered what other conditions might be in her future. After
some exploration she discovered that evidence (based on published research pa-
pers) suggested a high risk of dementia for people with her genomic proﬁle. She
worried that various parties, including MyGenome, the genealogy service, and
research studies with whom she shared her data, might share this and other
information in ways that she did not expect or intend and whether this might
have undesired consequences for her.

Figure 1: Properties of DNA that, in combination, may distinguish it from other data
types.
Alice’s story highlights several of the essential features of genomic data. We
depict six of them in Figure 1, which we review for orientation of the reader.
How does the result of a DNA-based lab test diﬀer from that of other tests?
One notable feature is how it is static and of long-lived value. Most tests, es-
pecially ones Alice could do for herself, like taking her temperature and blood
pressure, are of relatively short term value, whereas genomic data changes little
over a lifetime and may have value that lasts for decades. Of course, there are
some exceptions to this longevity. For instance, sequencing techniques improve
in accuracy over time, so tests may be repeated to improve reliability. Addi-
tionally, there are some modiﬁcations in DNA that accumulate over time (e.g.,
shortening of the ends of DNA strands due to aging [Harley et al., 1990]). Most
particularly, somatic mutations occur resulting in some degree of mosaicism in
every individual: the most striking examples are the deleterious modiﬁcations
of the DNA observed in cancer cells in comparison to DNA derived from normal
cells. However, this long-lasting value means that holding and using genomic
data over extended periods of time, as Alice did, is likely.
Alice’s ﬁrst use of her genomic data is expected to be a key driver for ap-
plication development in the future. While DNA has been used for some time
in parentage tests, it can be generalized from such studies to enable broader
inference of kinship relations. Services such as Ancestry.com and 23andme.com
already oﬀer kinship services based on DNA testing. While a substantial por-
tion of Alice’s DNA is in common with that of her relatives, it is also unique
to her (unless she has an identical twin). This has another set of implications
about potential use of genomic data, like its ability to link to her personally, a
property that makes DNA testing useful in criminal forensics.
Another of the essential values of DNA relates to its ability for diagnosing
problems in health and behavior. Tests are able to demonstrate increased like-
lihood for conditions like macular degeneration in old age and Alzheimer’s (the
most common form of dementia) [Goldman et al., 2011]. Although these are
5
often probabilities, they can have diagnostic value as well as privacy ramiﬁca-
tions [Seddon et al., 2011]. For instance, if Alice’s relatives learned about her
increased risk of dementia, might they (consciously or unconsciously) trust her
judgement a little less? Or might they instead help her to get timely treatment?
This power for good and bad has led genomic data to have a certain “mystique”,
which has been promoted by scientists and the media [Tambor et al., 2002].
Although there are many other types of tests (e.g., protein sequence tests) that
carry key common information with DNA tests, there is a special status that
DNA data has come to occupy, a status that some have phrased as “excep-
tional” [Bains, 2010]. These special fears about the sharing of genomic data,
whether founded or not, cannot be ignored when considering privacy implica-
tions. Hence, while DNA data may or may not be exceptional [Evans et al.,
2010; Gostin and Hodge, 1999], it is special in many ways, and hence warrants
particular care.
III Uses of Genomic Data
An individual’s genomic sequence contains over 3 billion base pairs, which are
distributed across twenty-three chromosomes. Despite its size, it is estimated
that the DNA of two individuals diﬀer by no more than 0.5% [Venter et al.,
2001]; but it is these diﬀerences that inﬂuence an individual’s health status and
other aspects (as discussed in Section II). To provide further context for the im-
portance of genomic data, this section reviews several of the major applications
in practice and under development.
III.A Healthcare
First, it has been recognized that mutation in an individual’s genomic sequence
can inﬂuence his well being. In some cases, changes in a particular gene will
have an adverse eﬀect on a person’s health immediately or at some point in
the future (i.e., the one gene, one disease, or OGOD, model) [Botstein and
