POPC=(Encoding, Delivery Protocol, Compare) where
• Encoding (Encd): It is a probabilistic public order-preserving
• Delivery Protocol (Del): It is an interactive protocol in which
the coordinators, C1 and C2 and the n participating entities,
Ni , i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} exchange certain transformations of the
data items encoded via POPC.Encd and generate the final
cipher in two rounds of communication.
• Compare (Comp): It is the comparison algorithm used by
POPC to compare the ciphers and decide their relative order.

The proposed protocol is described in detail in Fig. 1.
3 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
We implemented the proposed POPC.Encd using GNU multiple
precision arithmetic library and report the ciphertext bit size, la-
tency (time to produce one cipher) and throughput in Table 1. We
also present a comparative analysis of the communication and
computation overheads of sorting n numbers using POPC with
that of SMPC (both garbled circuit and secret shared based ), af-
ter tweaking the traditional SMPC architecture to suit our two
coordinator setting with no intra-party communication, in Table
2 and 3 respectively. Note that OT in Table 2 refers to oblivious
transfer and the communication complexity of any OT is in the

proach is implemented using Obliv-C [7] while the secret shared
approach is implemented using SCALE-MAMBA [1]1. Also note
that order-preserving encryption is completely unsuitable for our
setting because of its dependence on a secret key and hence we do
not include any performance comparison for it.
4 CONCLUSION
In this paper we propose a public order-preserving cipher genera-
tion scheme for distributed settings that is shown to be IND-OCPA
secure in the active attack model, without the need for any secret
key to be shared among the entities. The protocol is interactive in
nature with only two rounds of communication.
