Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-override-all-other-
styles-by-using-important has an issue.
If there is a space between "!important" and ";" test will return:
    Cannot read property 'length' of null
Having a space between last character and ";" on other lines do not provide a
failed test case.
