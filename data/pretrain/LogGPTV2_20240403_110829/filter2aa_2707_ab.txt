“Kinect-like technology could, for 
instance, be used in a home-
security system that wouldn't 
confuse the motion of pets or 
family friends with those of an 
unfamiliar intruder…
The algorithm is essentially there 
for doing that kind of application, 
it's just a question of whether this 
is a socially acceptable thing: 
having a camera looking in on 
people"

The Cell Phone as Loyalty Card
No one in advertising 
has ever been able to 
figure out how to do 
“one-to-one, real-time 
marketing. The mobile 
phone is where that will 
actually probably 
happen. It’s the only 
thing connected and 
always with you.”

A Look to the Future…
Through Wall Radar
•
Handheld through-wall radar, which has 
been designed to be used by police, 
special forces or the emergency services.
•
It provides quick and covert intelligence on 
the movement and location of people in a 
room or building - without the need for 
invasive sensors. 
•
Highlights moving people and objects in 
cluttered environments, through doors or 
brick, block and concrete walls.
•
Easy to use
•
Can be tripod-mounted for long-term 
surveillance
•
Remote monitoring and data recording 
using a laptop computer

“Now scientists can read your
mind better than you can”
Recent Experiment
-50% of humans accurately
predicted own future behavior
-Activity in medial prefontal
cortex, 75% accuracy
“While the findings can be 
important for advertisers seeking 
to hone a motivational message, 
they can be equally important for 
public health experts trying to 
persuade people to make 
healthier choices”
- Emily Falk, UCLA
Mobile User Data Mining
Example: A Recent ATT Project
• LA and NYC 
• March 15 – 15 May 2009
• Millions of SMS and Voice 
records
– Source / Destination Number
– Type and Duration of contact
– Cell phone tower ID
• Location accuracy w/i 1 Mile
• Studied travel habits
• New Yorkers travel 2.5 miles 
on weekdays and ~70 miles 
on weekends.

Reality Mining
•
The Reality Mining research project aims:
– developing technology and algorithms for 
sensing
– Modeling
– Changing human behavior. 
•
Some themes…
– Sociology in the 21st Century
– User Behavior Modeling and Prediction
– Relationship Inference
– Social Serendipity
– Organizational Dynamics
– Epidemiology and Information Dissemination
– Eigenbehavior
•
Complex Social Systems: “By continually 
logging and time-stamping information about 
a user's activity, location, and proximity to 
other users, the dynamics of large-scale 
human behavior can be measured. ”

Deep Learning
• $2M Four year DARPA project
• Identify objects, actions, and 
voices
• Spot activities like running, 
jumping, getting out of car
• Uses unsupervised learning
“Ideally, what we’ll come away 
with is a ‘generic learning box’
that can identify every data 
cue”

Augmented Reality
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Augmented_GeoTravel.jpg
The Internet of Things
• Self-configuring wireless network of 
sensors
• RFID will play a big role
• Purpose to interconnect many (all) 
things
• Ability to encode 50 to 100 trillion 
objects 
• Follow the movement of those objects. 
• Every human being is surrounded by 
1,000 to 5,000 objects 
• IPv6 Addressing 2^128
