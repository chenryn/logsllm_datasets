titleblackhat:us-19 WebAuthn 101 - Demystifying WebAuthn
Five years later and we're finally at the finish line: Proposed recommendation for W3C WebAuthn. This talk will go into some detail on the use cases WebAuthn sets out solve, how we got here, what's ready for implementation today and what's coming. *Any* service implementing authentication should take note.At Google I'm in the unique position to be part of the standards body, heading the team doing the implementation in platforms (Chrome, Android, CrOS) and responsible for our internal implementation so I have a pretty a unique perspective on this work.
