* Coordinates [longitude, latitude] must be valid. Longitude must be a real number in the range [-180, +180] and latitude must be a real number in the range [-90, +90].
* LinearRingShell encloses at most half of the sphere. LinearRing divides the sphere into two regions. The smaller of the two regions will be chosen.
* LinearRing edge length must be less than 180 degrees. The shortest edge between the two vertices will be chosen.
* LinearRings must not cross and must not share edges. LinearRings may share vertices.
* Polygon doesn't necessarily contain its vertices. Point containment in polygon is defined so that if the Earth is subdivided into polygons, every point is contained by exactly one polygon.
> [!TIP]
>
> * Using literal Polygon or a MultiPolygon may result in better performance.
> * If you want to know if any of the polygons contains a point, try the following steps: Fold the collection of polygons into one multipolygon. Then query this multipolygon. This may improve performance. See the following example.
