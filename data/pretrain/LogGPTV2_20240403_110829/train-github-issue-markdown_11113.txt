While debugging biocore/biom-format#816, we noticed that the return type of
`__getitem__` for a sparse matrix object changed between SciPy versions.
We did not see anything that stood out in the changelog regarding this, but we
apologize if we overlooked something. We also attempted to identify what
commit may have been associated with this but have so far not been successful.
We would be happy to assist on or contribute a PR if one is appropriate here.
#### Reproducing code example:
For SciPy 1.2.0:
    >>> import scipy.sparse as sp
    >>> import sys, scipy, numpy; print(scipy.__version__, numpy.__version__, sys.version_info)
    1.2.0 1.15.4 sys.version_info(major=3, minor=6, micro=5, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
    >>> print(type(sp.csr_matrix([[0, 1.0, 2], [3, 4, 5]])[0, 0]))
For SciPy 1.3.0:
    >>> import scipy.sparse as sp
    >>> import sys, scipy, numpy; print(scipy.__version__, numpy.__version__, sys.version_info)
    1.3.0 1.16.3 sys.version_info(major=3, minor=7, micro=3, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
    >>> print(type(sp.csr_matrix([[0, 1.0, 2], [3, 4, 5]])[0, 0]))
Behavior as observed with a 2D `np.array`:
    >>> print(type(np.array([[0, 1.0, 2], [3, 4, 5]])[0, 0]))
