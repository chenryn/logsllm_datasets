User: I just ran an update on ArchLinux which gave me Python3 and Python2.7.
Before this update, I was using Python2.6. The modules I have installed reside in /usr/lib/python2.6/site-package. I now want to use Python2.7 and remove Python2.6.
How can I move my Python2.6 modules into Python2.7 ?
Is it as simple as doing mv /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/* /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages ?
Assistant: The clean way would be re-installing. However, for many if not most of pure python packages the mv approach would work
