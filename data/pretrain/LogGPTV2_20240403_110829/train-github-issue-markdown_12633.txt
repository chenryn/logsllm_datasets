I was playing around with the idea of placing a`__tests__` folder into my
different directory areas.
So
    root
      |-pages
      |     `__tests__
      |             `index.test.js
      |     `index.js
      |-components
      |     `__tests__
      |     `Button.js
      |-layouts
            `__tests__
            `TwoColumn.js
But when I do this, I get duplicate issues because of files being copied into
.next
`.next/dist/pages/__tests__/index.test.js`
What is the best way to solve this? I know I can omit the files from jest, but
I don't think they should be copied over in general.
