Choose a monitoring tool suitable for your own system and network, such as Zabbix, Nagios, Prometheus, etc. 2. Install monitoring tools and configure monitoring objects (such as monitoring servers, networks, etc.). 3. Configure monitoring items, such as CPU load, memory usage, disk space, network bandwidth, number of connections, etc. 4. Configure the alarm rules, and set when the monitoring item exceeds the threshold, an email or SMS alarm will be sent to notify the administrator. 5. When necessary, analyze and troubleshoot monitoring logs, collect relevant data and logs, and implement corresponding problem solutions. Handling abnormal situations: 1. After receiving the alarm information, the administrator needs to log in to the server or control the service channel at the first time, check the health status of the server or network, and judge whether there is any abnormality. 2. If an exception occurs, according to the information provided by the monitoring tool, check the cause and implement the corresponding troubleshooting plan. 3. If it is necessary to maintain, update or expand the server or network, it is necessary to do a good job of change control and preventive analysis, and perform backup processing. 4. After the exception is handled, the key information and handling plan should be recorded for easy reference.
