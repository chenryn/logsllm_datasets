When bundling code that uses the `renderToString` method, multiple versions of
react-dom are included in the bundle.
    import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
This is the visualised breakdown of the code included in a bundle assembled
with esbuild with the following options (it is bundled up for use in a server
rather than client):
    {
          plugins: [pnpPlugin()],
          bundle: true,
          entryPoints: [`${routesDir}/${config.relativeFilePath}`],
          external: [
            'aws-sdk', // included in Lambda runtime environment
          ],
          minify: true,
          platform: 'node',
          format: 'cjs',
          target: 'node16.0',
          treeShaking: true,
          sourcemap: true,
          outfile: getOutFileForLambda(config),
          metafile: true,
    }

Note here the following files are included:
  * `react-dom-server-legacy.node.production.min.js`
  * `react-dom-server.node.production.min.js`
  * `react-dom-server.node.development.js`
  * `react-dom-server-legacy.node.development.js`
  * `react-dom.production.min.js`
  * `react-dom.development.js`
I would assume only two of these should be required (one for `react-dom` and
one for `react-dom-server`).
Note I carefully cleaned the dependency tree of the project to ensure there is
only one version of `react` and `react-dom` referenced.
The workspace this was tested in was created using Yarn 3.
React version: 18.2.0
## Steps To Reproduce
  1. Create a file `render.ts` that contains a call to the renderToString method.
    import type React from 'react';
    import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
    renderToString(Hi);
  2. Provide this file as the `entrypoint` to bundle it with esbuild
    esbuild render.ts --bundle --metafile=meta.json --platform=node
  3. Visualise `meta.json` with `esbuild-visualizer`
    esbuild-visualizer --metadata ./meta.json
## The current behavior
When using the `renderToString` method in a file that is bundled, the
following files are included in the bundle.
  * `react-dom-server-legacy.node.production.min.js`
  * `react-dom-server.node.production.min.js`
  * `react-dom-server.node.development.js`
  * `react-dom-server-legacy.node.development.js`
  * `react-dom.production.min.js`
  * `react-dom.development.js`
## The expected behavior
Only one instance of `react-dom` and `react-dom-server` should be included in
the bundle.
Note there is some reference to a legacy dom server in `react/server.node.js`
which maybe causing this issue:
