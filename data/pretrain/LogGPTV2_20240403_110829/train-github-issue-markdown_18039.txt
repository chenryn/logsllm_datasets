### Electron Version

### Expected Behavior
I want to create a voice chat with the electron framework. For testing
pureposes I created the Simple-peer /webrtc voice-chat as a website. The
connection between the Browser instances works.
### Actual Behavior
As soon as I start accessing the exact same website in Electron ( with
`mainWindow.loadURL` or copy and pasting the code and adjusting some urls) It
throws there errors:
> [4712:0611/224806.608:ERROR:audio_rtp_receiver.cc(95)]
> AudioRtpReceiver::OnSetVolume: No audio channel exists.
> [4712:0611/224846.392:ERROR:stun_port.cc(96)] Binding request timed out from
> 192.168.2.x:52325 ({653D86EF-2890-4553-8A92-A3CB302B2D3A})
Amazingly, the connection works when the Electron App gets the calls but now
when Electron tries to call other peers.
