### Electron Version
13.1.2

### Operating System
Windows 10 20H2

### Architecture
x64

### Last Known Working Electron Version
N/A

### Expected Behavior
I aim to create a voice chat application using the Electron framework. For testing purposes, I developed a simple peer-to-peer (WebRTC) voice chat as a web application. The connection between browser instances works as expected.

### Actual Behavior
When I attempt to load the same website within an Electron application (using `mainWindow.loadURL` or by copying and pasting the code and adjusting some URLs), I encounter the following errors:
```
[4712:0611/224806.608:ERROR:audio_rtp_receiver.cc(95)] AudioRtpReceiver::OnSetVolume: No audio channel exists.
[4712:0611/224846.392:ERROR:stun_port.cc(96)] Binding request timed out from 192.168.2.x:52325 ({653D86EF-2890-4553-8A92-A3CB302B2D3A})
```
Interestingly, the connection works when the Electron app receives calls, but it fails when the Electron app tries to initiate calls to other peers.
