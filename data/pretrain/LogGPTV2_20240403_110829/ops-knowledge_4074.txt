User: I am firing up a queue to complete some tasks in Python Appengine application. Is there a way to get the status of the queue? I would like to check whether it is still running or has incomplete tasks.
Assistant: There is a task queue link on your appengine console where you can look at the pending tasks, statistics and see what's going on.
