Merges a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD) with its corresponding parent VHD. The parent VHD will be modified to include the modifications from the differencing VHD. This command modifies the parent VHD. As a result, other differencing VHDs that are dependent on the parent will no longer be valid.
Important
You must choose and detach a VHD for this operation to succeed. Use the select vdisk command to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.
