**Applies to:**  
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `merge vdisk` command is used to merge a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD) with its corresponding parent VHD. The parent VHD will be updated to include all the modifications made in the differencing VHD. This operation modifies the parent VHD, and as a result, any other differencing VHDs that depend on the parent will no longer be valid.

**Important:**
- You must select and detach the VHD for this operation to succeed. Use the `select vdisk` command to choose the VHD and shift the focus to it.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
merge vdisk [depth=<number>]
```

**Parameters:**
- **depth=<number>**: Specifies the number of parent VHD files to merge together. For example, `depth=1` indicates that the differencing VHD will be merged with one level of the differencing chain.

**Examples:**
To merge a differencing VHD with its parent VHD, use the following command:
```plaintext
merge vdisk depth=1
```

This command will merge the selected differencing VHD with its immediate parent VHD.
