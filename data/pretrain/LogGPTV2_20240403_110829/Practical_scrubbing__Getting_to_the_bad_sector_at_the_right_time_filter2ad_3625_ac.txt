### Figure 9. Periods Detected for the Busiest 63 Disks Using ANOVA

This figure illustrates the periodic patterns detected in the I/O workloads of the 63 busiest disks, using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) approach. The insights derived from this analysis will help us develop more effective techniques for scheduling scrub requests, which we will define and evaluate in the following sections.

#### A. Insights from the Statistical Analysis of Traces

While previous studies [19], [20] have provided some general analysis of I/O workloads, this section focuses on specific I/O traffic characteristics that are relevant to scheduling background scrub requests. Our primary objective is to minimize the impact of scrub requests on foreground traffic by better utilizing the idle intervals experienced by hard drives.

**Periodicity:**
- **Importance:** Periodic behavior in the length of idle intervals is valuable for scheduling scrub requests because it provides a predictable pattern that can be exploited by the scheduler.
- **Prior Work:** Although there has been no prior research specifically focused on the periodic behavior of I/O workloads, one might expect such workloads to exhibit periodic patterns, such as diurnal trends.
- **Analysis Method:** We begin our analysis of periodicity with a visual inspection of how the request arrival rate varies over time. Figure 8 shows the number of requests per hour as a function of time for four representative traces from our trace collection.
- **Observations:**
  - All four traces exhibit repeating patterns, often with spikes at 24-hour intervals.
  - For Cello, these consistent spikes may be attributed to daily backups [21].
  - For MSR, activity peaks occur at different hours for different disks, with some days seeing smaller or no peaks.
  - We believe that such activity spikes are common in the field, and understanding these patterns can help in optimizing scrub request scheduling.

**Trace Details:**
- **MSR Trace:** Activity peaks vary across different hours and disks, with some days showing smaller or no peaks.
- **Cambridge (2008) Trace:** Similar to other traces, it exhibits repeating patterns with significant spikes at regular intervals.
- **HP Cello Trace:** Consistent spikes are observed, likely due to daily backups.

By analyzing these periodic patterns, we aim to develop more efficient scheduling techniques for scrub requests, ensuring minimal disruption to foreground I/O operations.
