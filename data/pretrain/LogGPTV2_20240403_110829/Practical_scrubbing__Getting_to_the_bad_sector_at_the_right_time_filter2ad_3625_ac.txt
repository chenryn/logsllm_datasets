of I/O workloads, to aid us in deriving better techniques for
scheduling scrub requests in Section V-A. We deﬁne and
experimentally evaluate those techniques in the remaining
sections.
A. Insights from the statistical analysis of traces
While previous work [19], [20] has provided some general
analysis of I/O workloads, in this section we look at I/O traf-
ﬁc characteristics that are relevant to scheduling background
scrub requests. The main goal is to schedule scrub requests
with minimal impact on foreground trafﬁc by making better
use of the idle intervals that hard drives experience.
Periodicity: Periodic behavior in the length of idle inter-
vals is helpful for scheduling scrub requests, since it provides
a predictable pattern that a scheduler can exploit. While we
are not aware of prior work that has speciﬁcally focused
on periodic behavior of I/O workloads, one might expect
I/O workloads to exhibit periodic patterns, such as diurnal
trends. We begin our analysis of periodicity by a visual
inspection of how the request arrival rate varies as a function
of time. Fig. 8 plots the number of requests per hour as a
function of time for four representative traces from our trace
collection. We observe that all four traces exhibit repeating
patterns, often with spikes at 24 hour intervals, but in some
cases also at other time intervals. For Cello, these consistent
spikes could be attributed to daily backups [21], while for
MSR activity peaks on different hours for different disks,
with some days seeing smaller or no peaks. We believe
that such activity spikes can be common in the ﬁeld, with
