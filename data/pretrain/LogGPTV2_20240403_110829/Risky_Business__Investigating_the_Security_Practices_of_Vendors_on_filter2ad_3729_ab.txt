Two co-spending addresses are likely to belong to the same
real-world entity. By monitoring co-spending, Chainalysis is
able to estimate which bitcoin addresses are controlled by –
for example – bitcoin exchanges.
3.2 Ethics
The Hansa Market back-end is similar in nature to that of
seized data used in earlier work [21, 37, 44]. Operating in
conjunction with applicable laws and regulations, the Dutch
authorities were allowed to seize the Hansa Market infrastruc-
ture. Despite the legal nature of the seizure, using this data
for research purposes raises some ethical issues, which we
discuss below.
In order to protect the privacy of Hansa Market users, we
took great care not to analyze personally identiﬁable informa-
tion (PII). Our data subset was limited to contain only data
vital to our research, and stripped of all PII – usernames were
replaced with unique IDs, private message logs excluded and
plaintext passwords hashed. When our analysis did involve
PII – i.e., to measure password strength, as this can only be
done using plaintext passwords – we asked law enforcement
to run our code and return the output. With this approach,
the data was cleared by law enforcement authorities for the
purpose of this research in accordance with Dutch privacy
law. To mine the data, whilst not compromising any present
and future investigations, we only had controlled on-premise
access to subsets of the data.
Next, we believe that our analysis does not create further
harm as we did not partake in or stimulate any criminal busi-
ness model – by purchasing criminal services, or in any other
way contribute to the criminal enterprise.The authors and in-
volved law enforcement professionals believe the beneﬁts of a
comprehensive understanding on ‘deviant security’, outweigh
the potential cost of making this kind of knowledge more
widely known [53]. More so, as the anatomy and economics
of online anonymous market are already well-documented in
earlier work [7, 49, 58].
Finally, this study has been conducted with the prior ap-
proval of, and in collaboration with, Dutch law enforcement
and public prosecutors. Note however, as we will cover in
Section 3.3, that over 87 percent of users were inactive buy-
ers for whom we have no evidence of illegal behavior. One
should not, therefore, conclude that the majority of subjects
were engaged in illegal behavior or that this was a factor in
deciding to use their data for our research. Yet, other infor-
mation in the back-end data can be directly used in police
investigations. However, due to the extensiveness of the data,
it also provides unique, behind-the-scene insights into how
market users operate. Note, that providing evidence of any
kind for continued law enforcement efforts is not the purpose
of this study.
3.3 Hansa Market descriptives
Back-end. The back-end database of Hansa Market consists
of more than a hundred data tables. Jointly, these give an
insight into the complete administration of the market. Due to
the classiﬁed nature of the data, we can not disclose the data
structure in detail. However, we can qualitatively describe the
data tables that are used in this paper.
The ﬁrst data table that is central in our analyses contains
information directly related to the user administration. Here,
we ﬁnd the registration dates of users, which users are regis-
tered as vendors and a ﬁeld in which the public PGP-key of
each user is stored. This table also lists whether a user enabled
two-factor authentication or not.
Second, we use a data table that stores information related
to the advertisements, or ‘listings’. It includes the product
class or advertisement category – e.g., credit cards – to which
a listing belongs, the description of the listing and the vendor
ID – which links listings to vendors. Additionally, this data
table contains a ﬁeld indicating whether an item should be
physically shipped or digitally delivered. We reason that the
front-end of the market used this ﬁeld to determine whether
the option of shipping (costs) should be presented and whether
a shipment ID should be generated in case the item is sold.
Shipping costs and a shipment ID therefore do not apply to
digital items.

Figure 1: Monthly orders and estimated revenue, per type of product.
The third table that we make use of, entails data that keeps
track of the orders that were placed by buyers. Information
on order status, order date and also the bitcoin address to
which the buyer’s payment is transacted, is listed here. By
default, Hansa Market purged orders older than 180 days.
Despite the fact that vendors could extend this limit, this auto-
purging feature results in missing data. Fortunately, Dutch law
enforcement discovered old back-ups that the administrators
of Hansa Market made. Consequently, parts of the presumed-
to-be-deleted order data could be resurrected. Even then, not
all orders could be recovered. We addressed this problem
by reconstructing the lower-bound number of sales using
the number of feedbacks given – as these were not purged.
In earlier work, feedbacks proved to be an accurate proxy
for transactions [49, 57, 58]. The feedbacks are stored in a
different data table that includes an order ID, a rating and the
price paid. As bitcoin payout addresses are only listed in the
order table – and its back-ups – not all orders have complete
payment information. Therefore, the data available to us does
not include all bitcoin addresses of all vendors.
The last data table we utilized, comprised the connection
logs that registered all logins of Hansa Market users. Since
Dutch law enforcement gained complete and unrestricted
access, they were able to alter the conﬁguration of the market.
They modiﬁed the market in such a way that passwords were
saved as plaintext in the markets’ connection logs [20]. As
a result, plaintext passwords are available for all users that
logged into their account during the last month the market
was operational. Later on, as described above, these password
were hashed so to exclude any PII in the subset of data we
use in this paper.
Descriptive statistics. The ﬁrst transactions on Hansa Mar-
ket date from mid-September 2015. These early transactions
entail dummy transactions between administrator accounts.
We removed these transactions from the data and we con-
sider the market to be publicly active from September 25th
2015 onwards. For most of the time that Hansa Market was
in operation, no large scale user migrations – for instance as a
result of law enforcement interventions – occurred. At the end
of Operation Bayonet however, the coordinated shutdown of
AlphaBay led to an enormous inﬂux of new users on Hansa
Market. We cannot directly compare these large amounts of
migrated users to the existing Hansa user base. Since we can
only analyze the Hansa data, all former AlphaBay users that
ﬂed to Hansa would seem ‘inexperienced newcomers’ to us.
Their past ‘career’, including their reputation and experience,
forms a blind spot. We therefore decide to discard all new
users, orders and transactions made after June 20th 2017 – the
day that law enforcement took over the administration of the
market.
To illustrate the amount of funds that ﬂowed through the
market, we estimate the generated revenue. We convert the
order price in bitcoins to dollars using the exchange rate
at the time that the order was placed. In the deﬁned time
period – which excludes the last month in which the number
of sales surged – we estimate over $33M is generated on
Hansa Market. We plot the monthly revenue and the monthly
number of orders in Figure 1.
Next, we distinguish three types of users. (i) Vendors –
users that sold at least one item, or that have at least one
feedback. Remarkably, this includes 160 vendors that are not
registered as vendors in the Hansa administration. From this
we conclude that some users are former vendors that decided
to downgrade their accounts to regular member accounts, per-
haps motivated to reclaim the vendor bond. (ii) Active buyers
– users that bought at least one item, or that provided feedback
to an item. (iii) Inactive buyers – users that registered an ac-
count on the market, but who did not buy or sell any items.
Hopefully, this includes all security researchers.

In Table 1, we list the most important descriptive statistics
of the market. We also describe how many orders are recon-
structed using feedbacks, due to purged order-related data.
3.4 Approach
Our approach to measure the prevalence of poor security prac-
tices across different types of vendors consists of two steps:
1. We identify characteristics of vendors that can explain
their security practices and cluster vendors that have
similar characteristics into distinct ‘vendor types’ using
latent proﬁle analysis.
2. We capture the security practices we identify in Section 2
in our data and measure the prevalence of poor security
practices across vendor types and compare these with
the practices of buyers.
We visualize our approach in Figure 2.
4 Vendor types
We now turn to identify characteristics of vendors that can ex-
plain their security practices and ﬁnd latent groups of vendors
based on these characteristics.
4.1 Vendor characteristics
Based one earlier work, we expect the following vendor
characteristics to relate to their security behavior.
Experience. According to Van de Sandt [53], the security
practices of cybercriminals are related to their experience.
New security developments may be ignored by relatively
inexperienced individuals, who do not become aware of
these (updated) security mechanisms available [55]. For
every vendor, we determine their experience on the market

by calculating the amount of days between a vendor’s ﬁrst
and last sale [57]. To account for any experience gained on
other markets, we also include the binary characteristic active
on other markets. This characteristic is based on whether
a vendor ‘imported’ a reputation, or rating, from another
market through the reputation-import functionality of Hansa
Market. Evidently, a vendor with an imported reputation
must be active on at least one other market.
Next to experience, a relation between ‘business success’
and security is expected since (i) investments in security
can be costly – in terms of time, knowledge, money – and
(ii) increasing proﬁts result in higher risks to security [53].
It is important to note that drug trade is set in a different
criminal context than the trade of cybercrime items. Van
Hardeveld [55] found indications that vendors with a
traditional (ofﬂine) criminal background are more likely
to make mistakes in their digital security. With regard to
business success, we therefore differentiate between the num-
ber of physical items sold and the number of digital items sold.
Physical items sold.
In the order data table, we count the
amount of orders that are physically shipped for each vendor.
Most physical items that are sold on online anonymous
markets are types of drugs – e.g., cocaine, cannabis, MDMA,
heroin or other psychoactive substances [7, 49].
Digital items sold. Likewise, we are able to count the digi-
tal items each vendor sold. Digital items include a great vari-
ety of products – e.g., botnet related items (tutorials, source
codes, DDoS services), hacked accounts, fake IDs, databases
of e-mail addresses, passwords and personally identiﬁable
information, exploits and malware, ransomware, credit card
details and listings that aim to recruit money mules [58].

4.2 Latent Proﬁle Analysis
As shown in Figure 2, we grasp multiple vendor characteris-
tics in a single variable by allocating each vendor a vendor
type. A vendor type is a cluster of vendors with similar ex-
perience, activity on other markets, physical items sold and
digital items sold. We create these clusters through a Latent
Proﬁle Analysis (LPA). This clustering algorithm maximizes
the homogeneity within clusters and heterogeneity between
clusters and takes data on any measurement level as input [35].
In recent work, Van Wegberg et al. [57] analyze data similar
to ours. Here, the authors also create clusters of vendors using
vendor characteristics. They show that vendors operating on
AlphaBay are best clustered into ﬁve groups. We therefore
estimate models with 1 to 5 clusters using the LatentGOLD
statistical software [60]. Then, we select a ﬁtting number of
clusters through both evaluating the global ﬁt via Bayes’ In-
formation Criterium (BIC) and the local ﬁt through assessing
the bivariate residuals (BVRs).
In Table 2, we present the results of the clustering
algorithm. As indicated by the low BIC value, we conclude
that the 5-cluster model has the best global ﬁt to our data. The
low total BVR value shows that the 5-cluster model provides
the best local ﬁt as well. The non-signiﬁcant BVR-value
indicates that there is no association between physical items
and digital items sold in the 5-cluster model. Thus, the
5-cluster model separates these characteristics particularly
well. Last, we perform pairwise Kruskal-Wallis H tests
to assess whether the means and medians of the vendor
characteristics are signiﬁcantly different between vendor
types. This is the case for all relevant 2 pairwise comparisons.
2Clusters 1-3 describe vendors that specialize in selling physical items:
vendors in these clusters do not differ signiﬁcantly in terms of their digital
sales. Likewise, clusters 4 and 5 consist of vendors that specialize in digital
items, who do not differ signiﬁcantly in terms of their physical sales.
It is important though, not to evaluate the model only through
numerical considerations [8, 36, 38]. We conﬁrm that the 5-
cluster model is a parsimonious model that clearly differen-
tiates between vendors that specialize in selling physical or
digital items. The 5-cluster model is easy to interpret in the
context of this work – which we will do next – and the sample
sizes are sufﬁciently large.
4.3 Resulting vendor types
Based on the distributions of vendor characteristics and what
product categories are dominant within clusters, latent proﬁles
emerge and each vendor is given a ‘vendor type’. We visualize
the clustering results in Figure 3.
The Novices (n = 988) have the lowest amount of phys-
ical and digital sales of all vendor types and have limited
experience on the market. About 80% of the products they
did sell are drugs, although some vendors made (few) digi-
tal sales as well. No vendors with more than 100 physical
or digital sales are present in the Novices cluster. In con-
trast, Drug Dealers (n = 509) have far more physical sales,
experience and activity on other markets compared to the
Novices. More than half of the vendors identiﬁed as Drug
Dealers have been active on Hansa Market for over 230
