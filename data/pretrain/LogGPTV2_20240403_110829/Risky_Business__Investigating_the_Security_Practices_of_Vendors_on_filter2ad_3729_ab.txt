### 3.2 Ethics

The Hansa Market back-end data is similar in nature to seized data used in previous research [21, 37, 44]. The Dutch authorities, operating within the bounds of applicable laws and regulations, were authorized to seize the Hansa Market infrastructure. Despite the legal basis for the seizure, using this data for research purposes raises several ethical considerations, which we will address below.

To protect the privacy of Hansa Market users, we took meticulous care to avoid analyzing personally identifiable information (PII). Our data subset was carefully curated to include only essential information for our research, with all PII removed. Usernames were replaced with unique IDs, private message logs were excluded, and plaintext passwords were hashed. In cases where PII was necessary for analysis—such as measuring password strength, which requires plaintext passwords—we requested that law enforcement run our code and provide us with the output. This approach ensured that the data was processed in compliance with Dutch privacy laws and cleared by law enforcement for research purposes.

We also believe that our analysis does not cause additional harm, as we did not engage in or promote any criminal activities. We did not purchase illegal services or contribute to the criminal enterprise in any way. The authors and involved law enforcement professionals agree that the benefits of a comprehensive understanding of 'deviant security' outweigh the potential risks of disseminating this knowledge [53]. Additionally, the structure and economics of online anonymous markets are already well-documented in earlier studies [7, 49, 58].

This study was conducted with the prior approval and collaboration of Dutch law enforcement and public prosecutors. It is important to note that over 87% of users were inactive buyers, and we have no evidence of illegal behavior for these individuals. Therefore, it would be incorrect to assume that the majority of subjects were engaged in illegal activities or that this was a factor in using their data for our research. However, other information in the back-end data can be directly used in police investigations. The extensive nature of the data also provides unique, behind-the-scenes insights into how market users operate. It is crucial to emphasize that providing evidence for ongoing law enforcement efforts is not the primary goal of this study.

### 3.3 Hansa Market Descriptives

#### Back-End

The back-end database of Hansa Market consists of more than a hundred data tables, collectively providing a comprehensive view of the market's administration. Due to the classified nature of the data, we cannot disclose the detailed data structure. However, we can describe the key data tables used in this paper.

1. **User Administration Table**: This table contains user registration dates, vendor status, and the public PGP keys of each user. It also indicates whether a user has enabled two-factor authentication.
   
2. **Listings Table**: This table includes information about product listings, such as the category (e.g., credit cards), description, and vendor ID. It also specifies whether an item should be physically shipped or digitally delivered, which helps determine shipping costs and shipment IDs.

3. **Orders Table**: This table tracks orders placed by buyers, including order status, date, and the Bitcoin address for payment. Hansa Market automatically purged orders older than 180 days, but old backups allowed us to recover some of this data. We reconstructed the lower-bound number of sales using feedbacks, which proved to be an accurate proxy for transactions [49, 57, 58]. Feedbacks are stored in a separate table, including order ID, rating, and price paid.

4. **Connection Logs**: These logs record all user logins. During the final month of operation, law enforcement modified the market configuration to save plaintext passwords in the connection logs. These passwords were later hashed to exclude PII from our dataset.

#### Descriptive Statistics

Hansa Market's first transactions occurred in mid-September 2015, with early dummy transactions between administrator accounts. We consider the market publicly active from September 25th, 2015. For most of its operational period, there were no large-scale user migrations. However, the shutdown of AlphaBay at the end of Operation Bayonet led to a significant influx of new users on Hansa Market. Since we can only analyze Hansa data, all former AlphaBay users appear as 'inexperienced newcomers' to us, creating a blind spot regarding their past experience and reputation. Therefore, we exclude all new users, orders, and transactions made after June 20th, 2017, when law enforcement took over the market.

To estimate the generated revenue, we converted the order prices in Bitcoin to dollars using the exchange rate at the time of the order. In the defined time period, excluding the last month, we estimate that over $33M was generated on Hansa Market. Figure 1 illustrates the monthly revenue and the number of orders.

We distinguish three types of users:
1. **Vendors**: Users who sold at least one item or received at least one feedback. Notably, 160 vendors are not registered as such in the Hansa administration, suggesting they may have downgraded their accounts.
2. **Active Buyers**: Users who bought at least one item or provided feedback.
3. **Inactive Buyers**: Users who registered an account but did not buy or sell any items, potentially including security researchers.

Table 1 lists the key descriptive statistics of the market, including the number of users, listings, orders, and estimated revenue.

### 3.4 Approach

Our approach to measure the prevalence of poor security practices across different types of vendors involves two steps:

1. **Identify Vendor Characteristics and Cluster Vendors**: We identify characteristics of vendors that can explain their security practices and use latent profile analysis to cluster vendors with similar characteristics into distinct 'vendor types'.
2. **Measure Security Practices**: We capture the security practices identified in Section 2 in our data and measure the prevalence of poor security practices across vendor types, comparing them with the practices of buyers. Figure 2 visualizes our approach.

### 4. Vendor Types

#### 4.1 Vendor Characteristics

Based on earlier work, we expect the following vendor characteristics to relate to their security behavior:

- **Experience**: According to Van de Sandt [53], the security practices of cybercriminals are related to their experience. New security developments may be ignored by relatively inexperienced individuals. We calculate each vendor's experience by the number of days between their first and last sale [57]. We also include a binary characteristic indicating whether a vendor is active on other markets, based on whether they imported a reputation from another market.

- **Business Success**: There is an expected relationship between business success and security, as investments in security can be costly and increasing profits lead to higher security risks [53]. We differentiate between the number of physical and digital items sold, as drug trade and cybercrime items operate in different criminal contexts [55].

- **Physical Items Sold**: We count the number of orders that are physically shipped for each vendor. Most physical items sold are types of drugs [7, 49].
  
- **Digital Items Sold**: We count the number of digital items sold, which include a variety of products such as botnet-related items, hacked accounts, fake IDs, and credit card details [58].

#### 4.2 Latent Profile Analysis

As shown in Figure 2, we use latent profile analysis (LPA) to cluster vendors based on their characteristics. LPA maximizes homogeneity within clusters and heterogeneity between clusters, and can handle data at any measurement level [35]. Following the approach of Van Wegberg et al. [57], who clustered vendors on AlphaBay into five groups, we estimate models with 1 to 5 clusters using LatentGOLD statistical software [60]. We select the best-fitting model by evaluating the global fit via Bayes' Information Criterion (BIC) and the local fit through bivariate residuals (BVRs).

Table 2 presents the results of the clustering algorithm. The 5-cluster model has the lowest BIC value, indicating the best global fit. The low total BVR value shows that the 5-cluster model also provides the best local fit, with no significant association between physical and digital items sold. Pairwise Kruskal-Wallis H tests confirm that the means and medians of the vendor characteristics are significantly different between vendor types.

#### 4.3 Resulting Vendor Types

Based on the distributions of vendor characteristics and dominant product categories, we assign each vendor a 'vendor type'. Figure 3 visualizes the clustering results.

- **Novices (n = 988)**: These vendors have the lowest amount of physical and digital sales and limited market experience. About 80% of their sales are drugs, with some making a few digital sales. No vendor in this cluster has more than 100 physical or digital sales.

- **Drug Dealers (n = 509)**: These vendors have more physical sales, experience, and activity on other markets compared to Novices. Over half of the Drug Dealers have been active on Hansa Market for more than 230 days.

Table 2 summarizes the clustering fit, showing that the 5-cluster model is the most appropriate.
