– Total retained: ~75
• Even with marging of error of 
3x, still only ~225 retained
How Many Vulns Did USG Retain?
Prior to “Reinvigorated Policy”
•
Example 1:
– Purchases
• 250 x important commercial  
vulns @ $100k each
• 250 total commercial vulns of 
which 91% disclosed
– ~25 total of vulns purchased 
per year are retained
• Assume similar number 
purchased from other agencies 
and similar number discovered
– Total retained: ~75
• Even with marging of error of 3x, 
still only ~225 retained
•
Example 2:
– Purchases
• 12 critical commercial vulns @ 
$1 million
• 5 critical non-commercial vulns
@ $1 million
• 32 major vulns at $250k
• 44 total commercial vulns of 
which 91% disclosed
– ~5 total of vulns purchased per 
year are retained
• Assume similar number 
purchased from other agencies 
and similar number discovered
– Total retained: ~15
• Even with margin of error of 3x, 
still only ~45
How Many Vulns Does USG Retain Today?
How Many Vulns Does USG Retain Today?
• Not hundreds or thousands per year but single digits
– High confidence in this assessment
How Many Vulns Does USG Retain Today?
• Not hundreds or thousands per year but single digits
– High confidence in this assessment
– Press reported that in one year (probably 2015) the USG 
kept "only about two for offensive purposes out of about 
100 the White House reviewed" [FN19]
– NSA executive responsible for disclosure for 15 years, 
Dickie George, confirmed “on average that three or four 
flaws were withheld a year” [FN17]
– Was told by NSA TAO and IAD leadership in autumn of 
2014 that zero so far retained that year 
Can We Prove or Disprove This?
Lines of Evidence
• Method 1: Historical and other comparisons
– Consistent information from multiple sources with no 
dissenting information
Can We Prove or Disprove This?
Lines of Evidence
• Method 1: Historical and other comparisons
– Consistent information from multiple sources with no 
dissenting information
• Method 2: Compare to total known 0days
– Between 40 (per Brian Martin) or 54 (per Symantec) 
0days found in the wild in 2015
– USG retention of single digits reasonable

– Tried but data too messy
Probably impossible

• Method 4: Look for conflicting evidence
– Evidence from vendors receiving vulns
– Political fall-out?
Probably impossible
Out of Scope
Can We Confirm Independently?
Lines of Evidence
• Method 5: Calculating from the total number 
of all USG discovered vulnerabilities
– George revealed NSA disclosed ~1,500 vulns per 
year [FN17] 
– NSA’s 91% disclosure rate of 1,500 yields 135 vulns
– Does not fit “single digits” but George confirmed 
that retaining was “very rare”
Potentially supports 
“dozens” retained 
before 
“reinvigorated” 
process
How Large is USG 0day Arsenal?
How Large is USG 0day Arsenal?
•
Probably dozens of vulns, not hundreds or thousands
– Moderate confidence
How Large is USG 0day Arsenal?
•
Probably dozens of vulns, not hundreds or thousands 
–
Moderate confidence
–
Arsenal would be function of 
•
How many years of retaining 0days: at least 15
•
Number of 0days retained per year: single digits 
•
Average number burned per year: say 50% (?)
•
Average life of 0day once used: ~300 days [FN20]
•
Average discovered by vendors or used by other actors: 25%
•
Average half-life of a 0days if not used: 12 months (?)
–
Difficult to get total > 50 or 60 
•
Likely too many either used by USG or other or simply become obselete
•
This count does not include ‘battlefield’ or other non-commercial systems
–
“The idea that we have these vast stockpiles of vulnerabilities stored 
up—you know, Raider’s of the Lost Ark style—is just not accurate.”

up—you know, Raider’s of the Lost Ark style—is just not accurate.”
Other Nations
• ~30 nations have offensive programs
– US, UK, Canada, Thailand, Sweden, Australia, China, Russia, 
Netherlands
• UK only other that speaks on the issue: 
– GCHQ announced disclosure of 20 vulns in 2016 (as of late 
April) [FN22]
• Love 'em or hate 'em, but United States Government 
only one with such transparency in process and 
overall numbers 
Additional Research Questions
1. Are agencies really submitting all vulns to VEP?
2. Can agencies use vuln while it goes through VEP 
process? [FN23]
3. Is there a more direct measurement available of the 
arsenal?
4. How will the next president change the process?
Recommendations for Governments
•
Former NSC officials Rob Knake and Ari 
Schwartz [FN24]
– Formalize process as Executive Order or 
Presidential Directive 
– Periodic review of retained vulns
– Transfer Executive Secretary function from NSA 
to DHS 
– Annual public report
– Expand Congressional role
– Mandate USG watchdog reporting: IGs and 
PCLOB
•
Mandate no use until vuln through VEP
•
More NSC direction to and accountability over 
executive secretariat
•
Other democratic nations should have similarly 
transparent processes
Recommendations for the Rest of Us
• Disclose to vendors to disarm governments
– Only kind of conflict where one side can disarm 
the other by foregoing a new capability! 
– If you get rid of your nukes, your adversary still 
has their own. If you disclose a vuln, you take it 
away from all sides! (from Joe Nye)
• More attention from the community, 
academia, journalists
• More FOIA please!
Today’s Talk
1. How does US government decide to retain or 
disclose 0days vulnerabilities?
2. How many 0days does the US government 
keep to itself every year?
– Hundreds? Thousands? More? Less?
3. How big is the full US arsenal of 0days?
– Hundreds? Thousands? More? Less?
4. What we don’t know & recommendations
