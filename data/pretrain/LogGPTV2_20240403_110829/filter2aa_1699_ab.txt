# How Many Vulnerabilities Does the US Government Retain?

## Prior to the "Reinvigorated Policy"

### Example 1:
- **Purchases:**
  - 250 important commercial vulnerabilities at $100,000 each.
  - 91% of these 250 total commercial vulnerabilities were disclosed.
  - Approximately 25 vulnerabilities purchased per year are retained.
  - Assuming a similar number of vulnerabilities are purchased from other agencies and discovered, the total retained is approximately 75.
  - Even with a margin of error of 3x, the total retained would still only be around 225.

### Example 2:
- **Purchases:**
  - 12 critical commercial vulnerabilities at $1 million each.
  - 5 critical non-commercial vulnerabilities at $1 million each.
  - 32 major vulnerabilities at $250,000 each.
  - 44 total commercial vulnerabilities, of which 91% were disclosed.
  - Approximately 5 vulnerabilities purchased per year are retained.
  - Assuming a similar number of vulnerabilities are purchased from other agencies and discovered, the total retained is approximately 15.
  - Even with a margin of error of 3x, the total retained would still only be around 45.

## Current Vulnerability Retention

- The US government retains a very small number of vulnerabilities, likely in the single digits per year.
- **High Confidence:**
  - Press reports indicate that in one year (likely 2015), the US government kept only about two vulnerabilities for offensive purposes out of approximately 100 reviewed by the White House.
  - Dickie George, an NSA executive responsible for disclosure for 15 years, confirmed that on average, three or four flaws were withheld annually.
  - In the autumn of 2014, NSA leadership stated that no vulnerabilities had been retained that year.

## Can We Prove or Disprove This?

### Lines of Evidence
1. **Historical and Other Comparisons:**
   - Consistent information from multiple sources with no dissenting information.
2. **Comparison to Total Known 0-days:**
   - Between 40 (per Brian Martin) and 54 (per Symantec) 0-days found in the wild in 2015.
   - The US government's retention of single-digit numbers is reasonable.
3. **NVD/CVE for Statistical Evidence:**
   - Attempted but found the data too messy, making it probably impossible to use this method.
4. **Look for Conflicting Evidence:**
   - Vendors receiving vulnerabilities.
   - Political fallout?
5. **Calculating from the Total Number of All USG Discovered Vulnerabilities:**
   - George revealed that the NSA disclosed approximately 1,500 vulnerabilities per year.
   - With a 91% disclosure rate, this yields 135 vulnerabilities.
   - While this does not fit the "single digits" narrative, George confirmed that retaining vulnerabilities was "very rare."
   - This potentially supports the idea that "dozens" were retained before the "reinvigorated" process.

## Size of the US Government's 0-day Arsenal

- **Moderate Confidence:**
  - The arsenal likely consists of dozens of vulnerabilities, not hundreds or thousands.
  - Factors affecting the size:
    - Years of retaining 0-days: at least 15.
    - Number of 0-days retained per year: single digits.
    - Average number burned per year: approximately 50%.
    - Average life of a 0-day once used: ~300 days.
    - Average discovered by vendors or used by other actors: 25%.
    - Average half-life of a 0-day if not used: 12 months.
  - It is difficult to estimate a total greater than 50 or 60.
  - Many vulnerabilities are either used by the US government or others, or they become obsolete.
  - This count does not include 'battlefield' or other non-commercial systems.
  - The NSA catalog of capabilities listed 50 vulnerabilities.
  - "The idea that we have vast stockpiles of vulnerabilities stored up—like in Raiders of the Lost Ark—is just not accurate."

## Other Nations

- Approximately 30 nations have offensive cyber programs.
- The UK is the only other nation that speaks openly on the issue:
  - GCHQ announced the disclosure of 20 vulnerabilities in 2016 (as of late April).
- The United States is unique in its transparency regarding the process and overall numbers.

## Additional Research Questions

1. Are agencies really submitting all vulnerabilities to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP)?
2. Can agencies use a vulnerability while it goes through the VEP process?
3. Is there a more direct measurement available for the arsenal?
4. How will the next president change the process?

## Recommendations for Governments

- **Former NSC Officials Rob Knake and Ari Schwartz:**
  - Formalize the process as an Executive Order or Presidential Directive.
  - Conduct periodic reviews of retained vulnerabilities.
  - Transfer the Executive Secretary function from the NSA to the DHS.
  - Publish an annual public report.
  - Expand the Congressional role.
  - Mandate USG watchdog reporting (IGs and PCLOB).
  - Prohibit the use of a vulnerability until it has gone through the VEP.
  - Increase NSC direction and accountability over the executive secretariat.
  - Other democratic nations should adopt similarly transparent processes.

## Recommendations for the Rest of Us

- Disclose vulnerabilities to vendors to disarm governments.
- Encourage more attention from the community, academia, and journalists.
- Increase the use of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.

## Today’s Talk

1. How does the US government decide to retain or disclose 0-day vulnerabilities?
2. How many 0-day vulnerabilities does the US government keep to itself each year?
   - Hundreds? Thousands? More? Less?
3. How large is the full US arsenal of 0-day vulnerabilities?
   - Hundreds? Thousands? More? Less?
4. What we don’t know and recommendations.
