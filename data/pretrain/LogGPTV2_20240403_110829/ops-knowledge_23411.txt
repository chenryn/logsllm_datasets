User: There is an existing Nginx server, and a reverse proxy needs to be configured to accelerate and distribute requests from multiple backend servers. Please provide the configuration scheme.
Assistant: The following is an example of a basic configuration scheme for Nginx reverse proxy: 1. Install Nginx If you haven't installed Nginx, please install it first. On the Ubuntu system, you can use the following commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx 2. Configure the nginx.conf file Open /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and use the following configuration parameters to set up the basic reverse proxy: http { upstream backend { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; } server { listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X- Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } } In this example, we define an upstream block named backend, which contains multiple backend servers. In the server block, we listen to port 80, and then use the location command to forward all requests to the backend upstream, which will automatically distribute the requests to different backend servers. We also use the proxy_set_header directive to specify some HTTP header information that may be useful to understand the origin of the request. 3. Restart Nginx Once you have made the configuration changes, you need to restart Nginx for it to take effect. On the Ubuntu system, use the following command: sudo systemctl restart nginx Summary: The above configuration is a very simple reverse proxy example, you can customize more complex configurations according to your needs. The reverse proxy function of Nginx is very powerful, which can help you distribute and forward traffic, so as to better improve the reliability and performance of the website.
