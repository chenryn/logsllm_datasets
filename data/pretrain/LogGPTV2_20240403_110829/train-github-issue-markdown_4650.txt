It seems like this was broken as a result of the recent change to make
newtypes structs immediate in certain cases.
    struct TestNode(@int);
    fn mm(_x: &TestNode) {}
    fn main() {
        let x = &TestNode(@21);
        mm(x);
    }
    % rustc foo.rs
    error: internal compiler error: drop_ty_immediate: non-box ty
