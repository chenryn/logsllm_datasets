User: Looking to do a very small, quick 'n dirty side project. I like the fact that the Google App Engine is running on Python with Django built right in - gives me an excuse to try that platform... but my question is this:
Has anyone made use of the app engine for anything other than a toy problem? I see some good example apps out there, so I would assume this is good enough for the real deal, but wanted to get some feedback.
Any other success/failure notes would be great.
Assistant: I am using GAE to host several high-traffic applications.  Like on the order of 50-100 req/sec.  It is great, I can't recommend it enough.
My previous experience with web development was with Ruby (Rails/Merb).  Learning Python was easy.  I didn't mess with Django or Pylons or any other framework, just started from the GAE examples and built what I needed out of the basic webapp libraries that are provided.
If you're used to the flexibility of SQL the datastore can take some getting used to.  Nothing too traumatic! The biggest adjustment is moving away from JOINs. You have to shed the idea that normalizing is crucial.
