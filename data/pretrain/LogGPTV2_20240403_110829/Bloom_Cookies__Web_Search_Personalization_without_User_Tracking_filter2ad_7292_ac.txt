2) Linkable users and max probability: The unlinkability
metric gives an average estimation based on entropy, but it does
not capture the full distribution of the a posteriori probability.
Entropy-based unlinkability tries to quantify the amount of
information that is required to totally break the anonymity of
a proﬁle (i.e., identify another proﬁle with the same owner), but
in practice successful attacks occur if a subset of the proﬁles
can be linked with a good probability, signiﬁcantly greater than
in the case of the uniform distribution.12 Others [13], [46] have
reported similar problems with entropy-based metrics and have
proposed complementing them with additional metrics such as
9In the actual experiments, to train the linkability model we used n = 300
users from the May 2013 logs (T 1 is May 1–15 and T 2 is May 16–30) with
a total of 66,746 queries.
10The Jaccard similarity coefﬁcient (or Jaccard index) measures similarity
between ﬁnite sample sets, and is deﬁned as the size of the intersection divided
by the size of the union of the sample sets. In our case the sample sets are
the user proﬁles. Each user proﬁle is in fact a set of URLs or interests.
11We used m = 1000 users from the June 2013 logs, with a total of 264,615
queries. P 1 is June 1–14 and P 2 is June 8–21.
12To illustrate, let us consider 4 proﬁles a user can be linked against.
The a priori probability is 0.25 for each proﬁle. Now, let us assume that
the a posteriori probabilities are either a) [0.05, 0.45, 0.45, 0.05] or b)
[0.115, 0.115, 0.655, 0.115]. The entropy for a) and b) is similar (1.469
and 1.476 respectively), however it is easier to link one of the proﬁles in
case b) (assuming the 3rd proﬁle is the correct one). Although, the average
unlinkability is the same, the number of correctly identiﬁed users is possibly
larger for b.
quantiles and maximum probability.
To address this problem, we use two additional measures:
linkable users percentage and max probability. Linkable users
percentage measures the percentage of users which can be
correctly linked using our linkability model. We compute the
linkability probabilities between the P 1 and P 2 proﬁles of the
m users to obtain a m ∗ m matrix of probabilities. Using this
matrix, we link each proﬁle from P 2 to a proﬁle from P 1,
starting with the one with highest probability and eliminating
proﬁles from P 1 and P 2 as they get
linked. We deﬁne
linkable users percentage as the percentage of users whose
proﬁles of two consecutive periods can be linked correctly.
Max probability is the maximum linkability probability in the
m ∗ m matrix of probabilities after removing the top outliers,
typically the top 1% (this is equivalent to computing the 99th
percentile as suggested in [13]).
C. Dataset
Queries. Research on search personalization has shown that
personalization cannot be applied to all types of search queries
successfully; personalization can improve some queries but
can instead harm others [45]. For example, personalization
has very little effects on navigational queries like “google”
or “facebook”. Instead, personalization can help ambiguous
queries (e.g., one-word queries, acronyms) [41] or expanded
queries [18]. To distinguish these cases, we separately report
results for the entire set of queries (all), one-word queries (one-
word), and expanded queries (expanded). Expanded queries are
queries that at the beginning of a search session contained only
one or two words and by the end of the search session were
expanded into several words. As an example, the query “ndss”
was expanded into “ndss security” which was expanded into
“ndss security conference 2015”. If a click was reported for a
result shown in the third query’s result page, we are interested
in evaluating whether when the ﬁrst query is submitted, per-
sonalization can rank the clicked result higher than it appeared
in the ﬁrst query’s result page.
Users. In measuring personalization, we selected users that had
a search history long-enough to build reasonable user proﬁles.
We selected users from the month of June 2013 that had at
least 250 queries in that month and whose resulting proﬁle had
at least 22 URL domains and 11 interests. For users with more
than 22 URL domains and 11 interests we used the top 22 and
top 11, respectively, so the proﬁle length was the same for all
users. We selected 308 users, for a total of 264,615 search
queries. User proﬁles were built using 2 consecutive weeks of
search history, while the following third week was used for
testing. Using a sliding window, we also tested the queries in
the fourth week. In evaluating privacy, we used a larger dataset
consisting of 1300 users (300 users from May 2013 and 1000
from June 2013) for a total of 331,361 search queries. These
users included the 308 users selected for personalization. For
evaluating privacy a larger set of users could be used because
no constraints needed to be imposed on the length of users’
search history.

IV. RESULTS
We now answer the design questions we posed in §II-C.
A. Limitations of generalized proﬁles
We ﬁrst report how generalized proﬁles perform under our
evaluation. For simplicity, we ﬁrst compare them with “exact”
proﬁles without any noise, i.e., proﬁles consisting of the URLs
frequently visited by users. This analysis will give us a lower
bound of unlinkability and upper bound of personalization of
noisy proﬁles as noise can only increase unlinkability and hurt
personalization of the exact proﬁle. Later we evaluate noisy
proﬁles as well.
Table I compares personalization and privacy of exact and
generalized proﬁles. For personalization, we report the differ-
ence between the avg rank of production-quality personal-
ization (called avg rankideal in §III) and the one obtained
when ranking results using our URL or interest-based person-
alization algorithms. For privacy, we compute entropy-based
unlinkability, linkable users percentage and max probability.
All personalization values in Table I, including exact pro-
ﬁles, are negative, which means that our personalization al-
gorithms perform worse than the production-quality algorithm
(i.e., avg rankideal is smaller than the avg rank obtained
with our personalization). This is expected as our algorithms
for user proﬁling and personalization are not optimized and
certainly not advanced as those used in the commercial search
engine. Moreover, they most likely use a shorter user history.
However, this negative performance does not affect our
evaluation because we are interested in evaluating the relative
loss in personalization when privacy protection is enabled.
We make two observations from the results in Table I.
First, generalized proﬁles signiﬁcantly hurt personalization.
The average rank with generalized proﬁles is from 24% (-
2.14 vs -1.73 for “all”) to 82% (-1.78 vs -0.98 for “expanded”)
worse than that with exact proﬁles, mainly because generalized
proﬁles contain less information for personalization. Other
studies on personalized search (e.g., [18]) drew a similar
conclusion and emphasized the need for exact URLs in the
proﬁles.
Second, as expected, generalized proﬁles provide better un-
linkability than (noise-free) exact proﬁles, but they still do not
ensure reasonable unlinkability. In other words, even though
anonymity of generalized proﬁles make linking consecutive IP-
sessions of the same user harder, user tracking is still largely
achievable—in about 44% of the cases.
Because of the limitations above, we argue that generalized
proﬁles are not suitable for privacy-preserving personalization
of web search. Exact proﬁles do not ensure unlinkability either,
but they are promising because they allow us to add noise. Next
we show that it is possible to add noise to increase unlinkability
without substantially hurting personalization.
Why do generalized proﬁles perform poorly? We took the
1000 users used in the analysis above and divided their search
traces into two 2-week time periods. For each time period,
we extracted their interest proﬁle. We then computed a) the
Jaccard similarity between the proﬁles of the same user from
the two time periods, and b) the Jaccard distance between each
Fig. 1: Jaccard distance of the interest-based proﬁle of each
user from an average proﬁle computed across all users (a),
and Jaccard similarity for each user’s 2-week long interest-
based proﬁles over 4 weeks (b). Users are grouped into
correctly/incorrectly linked (1000 users).
user’s proﬁle (from the ﬁrst time period) from the average
proﬁle. The average proﬁle was computed by treating the traces
of all users (from the ﬁrst time period) as one single user’s
trace and extracting the URL and interest proﬁles. Figure 1
reports the CDFs for a) and b). We distinguish between users
whose proﬁles were correctly or incorrectly linked across
the two time periods (this corresponds to the “linkable users
percentage” metric in Table I).
Correctly linked user proﬁles have on average the same
distance from the average proﬁle as incorrectly linked user
proﬁles (graph on the left side). In fact,
the curves for
incorrectly and correctly linked proﬁles saturate at the same
point (around a distance of 0.55). This shows how interests are
good at hiding users with unique proﬁles items, thus making
them less likely to be linked. Although this may seem intuitive,
the distribution of interests across all users is not uniform and a
large fraction of interests are unique among users. For instance,
we observed that the 20 top interests across all 1000 users are
common to 20–70% of the users, but then there is long tail of
interests which are unique to a handful of users. At a given
point in time, unique interests are not sufﬁcient to uniquely
identify users, but over time they make users linkable. In other
words, anonymity helps make users unlinkable, but it is not
sufﬁcient because the similarity between a user’s proﬁles from
different time periods can make them linkable. This is shown in
the graph on the right side: proﬁles whose similarity across the
two time periods is above 0.7 are likely to be linked (between
0.7 and 0.8 the curve of linked users shows a steep increase)
while proﬁles whose similarity is below 0.65 are likely not to
be linked.
B. Beneﬁts and costs of noisy proﬁles
We now consider the effect of adding noise to exact proﬁles
using state-of-the-art techniques represented by RAND and
HYBRID described in §III-B. Table II evaluates the privacy
protection (measured as entropy-based unlinkability, linkable
users percentage and max probability) provided by RAND and
HYBRID as well as their impact on personalization and network
efﬁciency. The noise level of RAND and HYBRID is controlled
by the parameter f, which represents the number of fake proﬁle
items added for each real proﬁle item. Both the algorithms
assume a dictionary D which contains 157,180 URLs and top-
3 ODP categories associated to each URL. Tests are executed
on the same dataset and using the same methodology as for

TABLE I: Personalization-privacy tradeoff for exact and generalized proﬁles. For personalization, the table reports the
difference between avg rankideal (extracted from the search logs with production quality personalization in use) and
avg rankU RL and avg rankInterest (obtained using our unoptimized URL and interest-based personalization algorithms).
Results are for “all” queries (308 users, 264,615 queries), with a breakdown “one-word” (44,351) and “expanded” (146,497)
queries. For privacy, it reports unlinkability as avg (stdev) entropy-based unlinkability, linkable users percentage and
max probability with top 1% outliers removed. Privacy results are computed for 1000 users (264,615 queries).
