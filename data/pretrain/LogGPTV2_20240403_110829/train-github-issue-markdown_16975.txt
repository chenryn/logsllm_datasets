##### Description of the problem
I have an issue when I export a JSON file from Maya using the JSONExporter. I
have been trying to export a character with morph targets, but can see no
option for this on export and no field for 'Morph Targets' in the JSON file
after export.
I have searched all over for an answer to this and posted a question to
StackOverflow, still with no solution
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36773360/how-do-i-export-a-json-file-with-
morph-targets-from-maya) leading me to believe that this is an issue.
Another issue with the JSON export from Maya is that when I import my
character into my Three.js scene and move a bone, there seems to be a
duplicate mesh underneath that doesn't move. This does not occur when I export
from Blender. I'm not sure if this issue is related to the one I am posting
about.
