The accuracy of the detection algorithm is a critical fac-
tor in the effectiveness of this response mechanism. There-
fore, the detection algorithm is evaluated at different levels
of accuracy based on the percentage of infected messages
that are successfully detected and stopped: 80%, 85%, 90%,
95%, and 99% accuracy. Figure 3 displays how the infec-
tion spread of Virus 2 is slowed by the detection algorithm.
When the detection algorithm accurately stops 95% of the
infected messages, the number of infected phones reaches
135 after nine days of propagation. However, without this
reaction mechanism, Virus 2 has infected 135 phones after
only two days of propagation. The difference between two
and nine days is signiﬁcant because the extra time could en-
able the phone service provider to ﬁnd a more permanent ﬁx
to the problem that could completely halt the virus spread.
Like the gateway virus scan, the gateway detection algo-
rithm produces similar results for Viruses 1, 2, and 4. The
gateway detection algorithm is ineffective against rapid-
spreading Virus 3 for the same reason that the gateway virus
scan is ineffective:
fast enough.
the response mechanism cannot react
Phone user education. Since all four of the illustrative
virus scenarios require the consent of the phone user to ac-
cept the message and infect the phone, changing the proba-
bility that a user will accept an infected message has a direct
effect on virus propagation.
In the baseline virus scenarios, the total probability that
a user will accept an infected message is 0.40. When the
phone user education response mechanism is evaluated, the
virus spread is examined for the cases in which the total
probability of acceptance has been reduced to 0.20 or 0.10.
In each case, the 0.20 total probability of acceptance pro-
duced a ﬁnal infection level at one-half the baseline level.
Similarly, the 0.10 total probability of acceptance produced
a ﬁnal infection level at one-quarter the baseline level. Fig-
ure 4 shows the baseline spread for each virus scenario (with
total probability of acceptance equal to 0.40), as well as the
phone user education response mechanism (with the total
probability of acceptance reduced to 0.10). When the user
education response mechanism is enabled, the total number
of infected phones plateaus at approximately 80, which is
25% of the number of infected phones in the baseline case.
This reduced plateau at 80 infected phones is observed in
the infection curve for all four viruses with user education
enabled.
Because reducing the probability that a phone user will
accept infected MMS messages is the most consistent de-
fense against any type of mobile phone virus requiring user
consent, phone user education should be part of any long-
term virus response effort. Decreasing the probability of ac-
ceptance both slows and eventually stops the virus spread.

All Viruses
Figure 5. Immunization Using Patches: Vary-
ing the Deployment Times (Virus 4 shown)
The caveat is that education is an ongoing effort due to the
constant inﬂux of new users.
Immunization using software patches. Mobile phone im-
munization involves the installation of patches to ﬁx vulner-
abilities that a virus could otherwise exploit. Both the time
to develop the patch and the time to install the patch on
every susceptible phone contribute to the delay in fully acti-
vating this response mechanism. As the analysis of other re-
sponse mechanisms has demonstrated, the time required to
fully deploy a response mechanism can have a large bearing
on its effectiveness, especially concerning rapidly spreading
viruses such as Virus 3.
Of the six tested variations of the immunization response
mechanism, three require 24 hours to develop the patch after
the virus becomes detectable, and the other three require 48
hours. Within each set of three, the length of time to deploy
the patch to all susceptible phones varies from 1 hour to 6
hours to 24 hours. As shown by the results for Virus 4 in
Figure 5, the patch development time determines how long
the virus is permitted to spread unrestrained. Each curve is
identiﬁed by the hours during which the deployment is in
progress. For example, the “Hours 24-30” curve displays
the results when patch development requires 24 hours and
distribution requires an additional 6 hours. The three most
effective cases, in which the patch is developed in only 24
hours, start limiting the virus spread earlier in the propa-
gation curve than do those cases that require 48 hours to
develop the patch.
Regardless of the patch development time, the length of
time to fully distribute the immunization patch (1, 6, or 24
hours) inﬂuences how much more the virus can spread dur-
ing the patch distribution process. When patch deployment
begins 24 hours after the initial virus detection and occurs
uniformly over a 24-hour period, approximately 60% more
phones become infected than if the patch deployment had
occurred over only one hour. However, the trade-off to a
fast deployment is that many servers are necessary to han-
dle the large amount of bandwidth, which can be expensive.
Viruses 1 and 2 once again show results comparable with
Virus 4, and Virus 3 once again resists the efforts of a re-
sponse mechanism. Virus 3 moves too fast for a patch to be
developed and deployed in time to be effective.
Monitoring for anomalous behavior. The ﬁnal two re-
sponse mechanisms are responsible for limiting the at-
tempts of infected phones to send outgoing infected MMS
messages. Since monitoring detects sharp peaks in activity,
monitoring for anomalous behavior is most effective against
aggressive viruses that attempt to send an extremely large
number of messages within a short time period. Once ac-
tivated, the monitoring response mechanism introduces a
forced waiting period between any two consecutive mes-
sages, which greatly slows the pace of virus propagation.
The monitoring response mechanism is evaluated while
the length of the enforced waiting period is varied from 15
to 30 to 60 minutes. Figure 6 displays the effect of the mon-
itoring response mechanism on fast-moving Virus 3. The
speed of Virus 3 makes it resistant to response mechanisms
with long activation times, but that same aggressive nature
is what enables the monitoring response mechanism to iden-
tify its suspicious behavior. Even when the imposed waiting
time between all outgoing messages from a suspected in-
fected phone is only 15 minutes, this response mechanism
can still constrain the infection level to under 150 phones
for up to 20 hours. In contrast, the baseline Virus 3 can in-

fect 150 phones in only about two and one-half hours. The
monitoring response mechanism buys time for a secondary
response mechanism to be implemented and stop a rapidly-
spreading virus.
Although very effective against Virus 3, the monitoring
response mechanism is ineffectual against Viruses 1, 2, and
4 because the self-imposed constraints of those viruses limit
the total number of messages sent from each phone per unit
time. As a result, the volume of infected messages sent from
any one infected phone within a monitoring observation pe-
riod is not radically different from the volume of normal
message trafﬁc. Thus, the monitoring response mechanism
does not effectively detect Viruses 1, 2, or 4.
Blacklist phones suspected of infection. The blacklist
response mechanism blocks all outgoing messages from a
phone after the number of suspected infected messages ex-
ceeds some threshold. The threshold should ideally be as
high as possible to avoid false positive activation of the
blacklist response, but the threshold must be low enough to
effectively restrict the dissemination of infected messages.
To study the effectiveness of the blacklist response mecha-
nism, infected phones are blacklisted after 10, 20, 30, or 40
infected messages.
Blacklisting at a threshold level of 10 infected messages
is somewhat effective for Viruses 1 and 4. The infection
penetration is restricted to approximately 60% of the base-
line infection penetration. However, blacklisting at higher
thresholds is ineffective for these viruses.
Blacklisting is completely ineffective for Virus 2 at any
threshold level because Virus 2 sends each infected mes-
sage to many recipients, so the number of infected messages
sent from a phone does not accurately capture the amount
of virus propagation activity.
The blacklist response mechanism is most effective
against Virus 3 (Figure 7) because Virus 3 propagates to ran-
dom phones without using contact lists. Only one-third of
the randomly-addressed infected messages are sent to valid
recipients, but all of those infected messages count toward
the threshold limit of suspected infected messages. There-
fore, blacklisting with a threshold level of 30 infected mes-
sages implemented against a virus with random propagation
is equivalent, in terms of effectiveness, to blacklisting with
a threshold level of 10 against a virus with contact list prop-
agation (where all contact phone numbers are assumed to
be valid).
5.3. Optimal Response Strategy
Each response mechanism is designed to slow or stop the
propagation of mobile phone viruses, but different response
mechanisms are needed to ﬁght different types of viruses.
For rapidly propagating viruses like Virus 3, the most
effective response mechanisms are based on monitoring for
anomalous behavior, such as the excessive volume of outgo-
ing messages generated by an infected phone. The speciﬁc
response strategy implemented after the virus is detected
determines whether the response mechanism merely slows
the virus spread (as monitoring did) or completely stops in-
fected messages from being sent from the infected phone
(as blacklisting did).
For more slowly propagating viruses, a more discrim-
inating response mechanism is necessary to identify the
presence of a mobile phone virus. This response can oc-
cur in the MMS gateway infrastructure owned by the phone
service provider or in individual mobile phones. The ad-

is that the mechanism is controlled by the phone service
provider and is largely hidden from phone users. Also, re-
sponse mechanisms in the MMS gateways could mitigate
some trafﬁc congestion due to infected messages.
Though possibly less straightforward to implement, ed-
ucating phone users about the risks of mobile phone viruses
should not be neglected. Since user education has universal
effectiveness, this response mechanism could enhance the
overall effectiveness of any virus mitigation strategy.
Because mobile phone viruses have the potential to at-
tack in many different ways, an optimal response strategy
must incorporate mechanisms to counteract a wide variety
of virus behaviors. Although the results presented here use
a population size of 1000 phones, additional experiments
with a 2000-phone population demonstrate that our results
scale nicely to larger population sizes.
Our results would also be valuable in conjunction with
implementation cost data for each response mechanism.
Since the implementation costs could vary greatly depend-
ing on the implementation details and the existing in-
frastructure of an individual service provider, broad cost-
based comparisons between response mechanisms with-
out company-speciﬁc cost data would be difﬁcult to jus-
tify. However, we can still assume that there are increas-
ing costs associated with implementing a stronger version
of the same response mechanism. Given this, the results
of our experiments are useful for locating the point of di-
minishing returns for each individual response mechanism,
the point where implementing a faster or more accurate re-
sponse mechanism does not much improve the success rate
of the response mechanism.
6. Conclusions
Mobile phone viruses present an emerging problem that
threatens the dependability and security of mobile phone
communications. We proposed six response mechanisms
three response points in
that respond to this threat at
the propagation process:
the point of reception by target
phones, the point of infection on target phones, and the
point of dissemination from infected phones. To quantify
the effectiveness of these response mechanisms, we devel-
oped a model to simulate virus propagation with and with-
out response mechanisms. Within the model, four speciﬁc
virus test cases were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
response mechanisms. The experimental results revealed
that response mechanisms must be agile enough to respond
quickly to rapidly propagating viruses and discriminating
enough to detect more stealthy, slowly propagating viruses.
An optimal virus response strategy must be able to address
many different types of virus behavior.
This work can be extended with an evaluation of com-
binations of reaction mechanisms, particularly when a re-
sponse mechanism that only slows virus propagation re-
quires a secondary mechanism to completely halt virus
spread. This same virus propagation modeling approach
can also be used to evaluate response mechanisms for mo-
bile phone viruses that spread through means other than
MMS messages, such as viruses that spread using the Blue-
tooth interface on a phone.
