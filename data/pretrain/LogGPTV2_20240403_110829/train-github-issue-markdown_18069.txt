### Issue Description

When executing an `INSERT` SQL statement with multiple encrypted columns, some of which are `NULL`, the `encrypt-jdbc` module in ShardingSphere (version 4.0.0-RC2) rewrites the SQL incorrectly, resulting in plain columns being out of order. However, if I set the `NULL` columns to an empty string (`""`), the SQL is rewritten correctly.

### Version Update and New Issue

After updating to ShardingSphere version 4.0.0-RC3-SNAPSHOT and running the same SQL, a new bug has emerged.
