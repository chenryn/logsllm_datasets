Figure 2: Excerpts from our de-anonymization experiments. Each row lists keywords extracted from the Wikipedia biography of an individual
(categorized under “California” or “Illinois”), a hit returned by a Google query on those keywords that is one of the top three hits returned and
contains the individual’s name, and the name of the individual.
5.3 Web-based Sensitive Topic Detection
Another application of Web-based inference detection is
the redaction of medical records. As discussed earlier, it
is common practice to redact all information about dis-
eases such as HIV/Aids, mental illness, and drug and
alcohol abuse, prior to releasing medical records to a
third party (such as, e.g., a judge in malpractice liti-
gation). Implementing such protections today relies on
the thoroughness of the redaction practitioner to keep
abreast of all the medications, physician names, diag-
noses and symptoms that might be associated with such
conditions and practices. Web-based inference detection
can be used to improve the thoroughness of this task by
automating the process of identifying the keywords al-
lowing such conditions to be inferred.
To demonstrate how our algorithm can be used in this
application, our experiments take as input a page that is
viewed as authoritative about a certain disease. In our
experiments, we used Wikipedia to supply pages for al-
coholism and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The
text is then extracted from the html, and keywords are
identiﬁed. To identify keywords that might allow the
associated disease to be inferred we then issued Google
queries on subsets of keywords and examined the top hit
for references to the associated disease. In general, we
counted as a reference any mention of the associated dis-
ease. The one exception to this rule is that we ﬁltered out
some medical term sites since such sites list unrelated
medical terms together (for indexing purposes) and we
didn’t want such lists to trigger inference results.
In the event that such a reference was found we
recorded those keywords as being potentially inference-
enabling. In practice, a redaction practitioner might then
use this output to decide what words to redact from med-
ical records before they are released in order to preserve
the privacy of the patient.
To gain some conﬁdence in our approach we also used
a collection of general medical terms as a “control” and
followed the same algorithm. That is, we made Google
queries using these medical terms and looked for refer-
ences to a sensitive disease (STDs and alcoholism) in the
returned links. The purpose of this process was to see
if the results would differ from those obtained with key-
words from the Wikipedia pages about STDs and alco-
holism. We expected a distinct difference because the
Wikipedia pages should yield keywords more relevant to
STDs and alcoholism, and indeed the results indicate that
is the case.
The following describes our experiment in more de-
tail.
1. Input: An ordered set of sensitive words, K∗ =
{v1, . . . , vb}
, for some positive integer b, and a
page, B. B is either the Wikipedia page for alco-
holism [40], the Wikipedia page for sexually trans-
mitted diseases (STDs) [41] or a “control” page of
general medical terms.
(a) If B is a Wikipedia page, extract the top
30 keywords from B, forming the set SB,
through the following steps:
i. Extract text from html.
ii. Calculate the enhanced TF.IDF ranking
of each word in the extracted text (sec-
tion 3). Select the top 30 words as the
ordered set, SB = {W1, W2, . . . , W30}
.
(b) If B is a medical terms page, extract the terms
using code customized for that Web site and

(c) For each pair of words
let WB = {W1, W2, . . . , W30}
be a subset
of 30 terms from that list, where the selec-
tion method varies with each run of the exper-
iment (see the results discussion below for the
speciﬁcs).
{Wi, Wj} ∈ SB, let
Qi,j be the query consisting of just those two
words with no additional punctuation and the
restriction that no pages from the domain of
source page B be returned, and that all re-
turned pages be text or html (to avoid parsing
difﬁculties). Let Hi,j denote the ﬁrst hit re-
turned after issuing query Qi,j to Google, after
known medical terms Web sites were removed
from the Google results8.
(d) For all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , 30}
, i 6= j, and for
, search for the string v` ∈ K∗
` 6= {1, . . . , b}
in the ﬁrst 5000 lines of Hi,j. If v` is found,
record v`, wi, wj and Hi,j and discontinue the
search.
2. Output: All triples (v`, Qi,j, Hi,j) found in step 1,
where v` is in the ﬁrst 5000 lines of Hi,j.
RESULTS FOR STD EXPERIMENTS. We ran the above
test on the Wikipedia page about STDs [41], B, and a
selected set, B0
, of 30 keywords from the medical term
index [29]. The set B0
was selected by starting at the
49th
entry in the medical term index and selecting every
400th
word in order to approximate a random selection
of medical terms. As expected, keyword pairs from input
B generated far more hits for STDs (306/435 > 70%)
than keyword pairs from B0
(108/435 < 25%). The
results are summarized in ﬁgure 3.
RESULTS FOR ALCOHOLISM EXPERIMENTS. We ran
the above test on the Wikipedia page about alcoholism
[40], B, and a selected set, B0
, of 30 keywords from the
medical term index [29]. For the run analyzed in Fig-
ure 4, the set B0
was selected by starting at the 52nd
entry
in the medical term index and selecting every 100th
word
until 30 were accumulated in order to approximate a ran-
dom selection of medical terms. As expected, keyword
pairs from input B generated far more hits for alcoholism
(47.82%) than B0
(9.43%). In addition, we manually re-
viewed the URLs that yielded a hit in v ∈ K∗
Alc for a
seemingly innocuous pair of keywords. These results are
summarized in ﬁgure 4.
APPLYING THE RESULTS. When redacting medical
records, a redaction practitioner might use the results in
ﬁgures 3 and 4 to choose content to redact. For exam-
ple, ﬁgure 4 indicates the medications naltrexone and
acamprosate should be removed due to their popular-
ity as alcoholism treatments. The words identiﬁed as
STD-inference enabling are far more ambiguous (e.g.
“transmit”, “infected”). However, for some individuals
the very fact that even general terms are frequently as-
sociated with sensitive diseases may be enough to jus-
tify redaction (e.g. a politician may desire the removal
of any “red ﬂag” words). In general though, we think
a redaction practitioner could defensibly not make it a
practice to redact such general terms given their associa-
tion with other, less sensitive, diseases. This emphasizes
that our techniques support semi-automation, but not full
automation, of the redaction process.
PERFORMANCE. Amortizing the cost of text extraction
from the Wikipedia source page over all the queries, de-
termining if each keyword pair yielded a top hit contain-
ing a sensitive word took approximately 150 seconds.
Hence, each of the experiments in ﬁgures 3 and 4 took
around 6 hours, since 435 pairs from the Wikipedia page
were tested along with 435 pairs from the “control” set
of keywords.
As in the de-anonymization experiments, our main
time cost was due to the process of text extraction from
html. For these experiments caching is likely to signiﬁ-
cantly improve performance as many of the medical re-
source sites were visited multiple times.
6 Use Scenario: Iterative Redaction
As mentioned in sections 1 and 4, the process of sani-
tizing documents by removing obviously identifying in-
formation like names and social security numbers can
be improved by using Web-based inference detection to
identify pieces of seemingly innocuous information that
can be used to make sensitive inference. To illustrate this
idea, we return to the poorly redacted FBI document in
the left-hand side of ﬁgure 6. Algorithms like those pre-
sented in sections 3.2 and 5 can be used to identify sets
of keywords that allow for undesired inferences. Some
or all of those keywords can then be redacted to improve
the sanitization process.
We emphasize that the strategy for redacting based
upon the inferences detected by our algorithms is a re-
search problem that is not addressed by this paper. In-
deed many strategies are possible. For example, one
might redact the minimum set of words (in which case,
the redactor seeks to ﬁnd a minimum set cover for the
collection of sets output by the inference detection algo-
rithm). Alternatively, the redactor might be biased in fa-
vor of redacting certain parts of speech (e.g. nouns rather
than verbs) to enhance readability of the redacted docu-
ment.
The type of redaction strategy that is employed may
inﬂuence the Web-based inference detection algorithm.
For example, if the goal is to redact the minimum set of
words, then it is necessary to consider all possible sets
