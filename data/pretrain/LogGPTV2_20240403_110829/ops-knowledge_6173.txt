User: I just downloaded and installed Anaconda on my Windows computer. However, I am having trouble executing .py files using the command prompt. How can I get my computer to understand that the python.exe application is in the Anaconda folder so it can execute my .py files?
Assistant: Launch JupyterLab from Anaconda
(Perform the following operation with JupyterLab ...)
Click on icon folder in side menu
Start up  "Text File"
Rename untitle.txt to untitle.py (The name of the file started up was also changed)
Start up the "terminal" (In windows the power shell starts up)
Execute the command python untitle.py
