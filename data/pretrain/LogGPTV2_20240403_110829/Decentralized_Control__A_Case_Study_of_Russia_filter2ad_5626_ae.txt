### Analysis of Censorship Mechanisms in Russia

#### IP and DNS Blocking Observations
Upon receiving the IP from the control, we noted that Probe 14 also experienced high levels of IP blocking, as illustrated in Figure 7. This suggests that Probe 14 is encountering a combination of DNS and IP blocking. Similarly, for Probes 12 and 13, we observed behavior consistent with keyword-based blocking, though the blockpage failed to load in some instances.

#### Remote Measurements
We conducted remote measurements for RUBLdom using 357 vantage points for Satellite and 718 for Quack. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) in Figure 5 illustrate the blocking behavior for resolvers in Satellite and echo servers in Quack. There are significant variations in the fraction of blocked content across different vantage points in both Satellite and Quack. Some vantage points did not observe any blocking, while others reported substantial blocking. Notably, Satellite observed more extensive blocking compared to Quack, which aligns with our findings of substantial DNS manipulation at three of our vantage points. We hypothesize that many Russian ISPs may not be blocking content on port 7, thus evading detection by Quack. This is a known limitation of Quack, as it does not trigger censors that act only on ports 80 and 443. This suggests that one method of circumventing censorship might be serving content over non-standard ports.

Figure 5 also shows the aggregated blocking at the AS level. The similarity between the two CDFs indicates that blocking occurs at the AS or ISP level. In Satellite, over 70% of vantage points observed little to no blocking, while in Quack, 50% of vantage points saw no blocking, and nearly 90% observed minor blocking.

In our Quack measurements, we analyzed the types of blocking observed at each echo server. Similar to our observations in data center VPSes, some vantage points encountered blockpages, while others experienced resets and timeouts (more frequently resets). This demonstrates that censorship mechanisms vary widely across networks in Russia.

We also examined the similarity between domains being blocked across our remote vantage points. The pairwise Jaccard similarity is depicted in Figure 6. Our observations from VPSes and residential probe measurements are consistent with remote measurements. Both Satellite and Quack show instances of high similarity, either due to a high percentage of blocked domains or because vantage points are within the same ISP. The large blue portions in both plots indicate that vantage points with minimal blocking do not see the same domains being blocked.

#### Characterizing Censorship of RUBLip Measurements
To study the extent of IP blocking in RUBLip, we analyzed the output of our TCP/IP measurements from both VPSes and probes. The amount of IP blocking is represented by the red bars in Figure 7, overlaid with the total percentage of blocked domains. Overall, we observed a smaller percentage of IPs being blocked compared to domains, which could suggest an effort by censors to minimize collateral damage (other services hosted on the same IPs would also be blocked). Alternatively, it may be that residential ISPs do not observe much traffic to IPs and choose to censor only the traffic they see.

Similar to our observations in RUBLdom, some vantage points observed blocking of many IPs, while others saw only a few. VPSes reported a considerable amount of IP blocking, whereas blocking was more sparse in probes. Our experience suggests that data center VPS providers might also be injecting resets and forcing timeouts. In residential probes, only Probe 14 observed more than 50% of IPs being blocked, while four out of six VPSes observed more than 50% IP blocking. This supports the hypothesis that residential ISPs tend to block the kind of traffic they see more frequently, which is predominantly domain-related traffic.

#### Subnet Blocking Observations
Table V shows the number of subnets completely blocked by vantage points, omitting those where at least one IP from each subnet was reachable. Consistent with our previous observations, some vantage points (e.g., VPS 2 and Probe 2) blocked almost all subnets, while others (e.g., VPS 6) blocked a moderate amount, and some (e.g., Probe 12) did very little blocking. This corroborates our findings in Section VI-C that different ISPs may prioritize blocking different items in RUBL.

Similar to our observations in RUBLip, VPSes in data centers observed much higher blocking in RUBLsub compared to residential probes, with only Probe 2 observing a large amount of RUBLsub blocking. Our RUBLip and RUBLsub studies suggest that most residential ISPs prefer to block using the domain in the request rather than the IP to which users ultimately connect. Further RUBLsub analysis can be found in Appendix D.

### Discussion and Conclusion
Russia's move towards more restrictive Internet policies highlights the broader context of tightening information controls globally. Censorship studies have traditionally focused on centralized networks like those in China and Iran, but Russia's network, shaped by competitive market forces, presents a decentralized model. The development of effective censors in such a network raises important questions about the future of censorship, even in western countries that have not historically favored it.

Our study shows that the implementation of decentralized control breaks the mold of traditional "censorship," which is typically a synchronized and homogeneous process. While Roskomnadzor has coordinated blocking across various ISPs, achieving homogeneity in blocking methods remains a challenge. However, with the advent of SORM and the commoditization of censorship and surveillance technology, it is becoming easier and cheaper for ISPs to comply with government demands.

The variegated nature of Russia's censorship regime has significant implications for future research. It is no longer sufficient to perform measurements from one or a few vantage points within the censoring country. Even two end-users in the same physical location may have dramatically different experiences with censors based on their ISP. Measuring the actual impact of censorship requires diverse vantage points, including residential network ISPs, infrastructural machines, and data centers.

Decentralized control also creates more barriers to discovering effective circumvention methods. As Russia moves to block access to VPNs, users will need to rely on more exotic means of circumvention. Since the method of blocking varies between networks, finding locally effective circumvention tools becomes more difficult. Techniques like refraction networking or domain fronting may become necessary. In any event, Russia has sparked an arms race in censorship and circumvention, with effects likely to be felt worldwide.

Other large nations are beginning to apply schemes similar to Russia's. In the United States, ISPs have been deploying DPI boxes to throttle connections to specific websites or favor certain content. The United Kingdom's censorship model is similar to Russia's, with the government providing ISPs a list of websites to censor and having governing bodies for various types of censored material. For both the U.S. and the U.K., this means that while the current regimes may not restrict the volume of information as Russia does, the option to follow the same path is cheap and readily accessible.

This trend is also evident in other countries. Portugal has been cited for not supporting net neutrality, Indonesia recently implemented broader content filtering, and India has been ramping up censorship. A recent report finds that Russian information controls and surveillance technology are being exported to at least 28 countries. As more countries move towards stricter Internet access, Russia's model for censorship may become more commonplace, even in countries with a tradition of freedom of expression on the Internet.

In conclusion, Russia's decentralized information control regime raises the stakes for censorship measurement and resistance. Its censorship architecture serves as a blueprint and perhaps a forewarning of what national censorship regimes could look like in many other countries with similarly diverse ISP ecosystems. As more countries require ISPs to deploy DPI infrastructure for purposes of copyright enforcement or filtering pornography, we risk a slippery slope where Russian-style censorship could easily be deployed. We hope our study is the first in a long line of research into the exact machinations and implications of decentralized control. Such work may be the only way to protect the free and open Internet.
