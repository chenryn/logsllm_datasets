with the IP received from control. Considering Probe 14 also
sees high IP blocking as shown in Figure 7, we believe Probe
14 observes a combination of DNS and IP blocking. Similarly
for Probes 12 and 13, we observe behavior consistent with
Keyword Based blocking but the blockpage was unable to load
in some cases.

Figure 5: Fraction of domains blocked at the individual
vantage point as well as AS (aggregated) level—There are
some vantage points and ASes that only block little content,
while others block comparatively many more domains. The
similarity between the lines shows that blocking is happening
at the AS level. Our measurements using Satellite observed
much more interference compared to Quack measurements. (cid:5)
3) Remote Measurements: We conduct remote measure-
ments for RUBLdom using 357 vantage points for Satellite and
718 for Quack. The CDFs in Figure 5 show the blocking
behavior for resolvers in Satellite and echo servers in Quack.
There are large variations in the fraction of blocking between
vantage points in both Satellite and Quack. There are some
vantage points that do not observe any blocking, while others
observe a large amount of blocking. Between Quack and
Satellite, Satellite observed considerably more blocking, which
is in line with at least three of our vantage points that observed
large amounts of DNS manipulation. We suspect that many
Russian ISPs may not be blocking content on port 7, and hence
are not captured by Quack. This is a known shortcoming of
Quack by not triggering censors that only act on port 80 and
443. This suggests that one method of circumventing censorship
might be serving content over non-standard ports.
Figure 5 also shows the fraction of blocking aggregated
at the AS level. The similarity between the two CDFs shows
that blocking does indeed happen at the AS or ISP level. In
Satellite, we observe that more than 70% of vantage points
observe little to no blocking, while in Quack 50% of vantage
points observe no blocking, and close to 90% observe minor
blocking.
In our Quack measurements, we were able to look at the
kind of blocking observed at each of the echo servers. Similar
to our observations in the VPSes in data centers, some vantage
points observe blockpages, many others observe resets and
timeouts (more frequently resets), showing that censorship
mechanisms vary widely in networks all over Russia.
We looked at the similarity between domains being blocked
in our remote vantage points. The pairwise similarity is shown
in Figure 6. We see that our observations from the VPSes
and residential probe measurements are consistent with remote
measurements as well. Both Satellite and Quack see instances
of high similarity, which is either because the vantage points
see a high percentage of domains blocked (top left) or because
vantage points are inside the same ISP (small square stripes
along the diagonal line). The large blue portions on both plots
show that vantage points which observe little blocking do not
see the same domains being blocked.
C. Characterizing Censorship of RUBLip Measurements
We study the extent of blocking of IPs in RUBLip by
analyzing the output of our TCP/IP measurements from both
Figure 6: Pairwise Jaccard similarity of domains blocked
in remote measurements—As in the direct measurements, we
observe some similarity between domains blocked in remote
measurements (Satellite on the left, Quack on the right) either
due to high blocking or vantage points in the same ISP. (cid:5)
Figure 7: Blocking by method when testing RUBLip on
VPSes and residential probes—Data center vantage points
observe much higher IP blocking compared to residential probes,
where domain blocking is more popular. (cid:5)
our VPSes and probes. The amount of IP blocking is shown
by the red bars in Figure 7. For comparison, we overlay the
total percentage of domains blocked in these vantage points as
well. Overall, we see a smaller percentage of IPs being blocked
compared to domains, which could indicate a desire by the
censors to minimize collateral damage (other services hosted
on the same IPs would be blocked as well). Alternatively, it
could be that residential ISPs do not observe much trafﬁc to
IPs, and opt to censor only the trafﬁc they see.
Similar to our observations in RUBLdom, we ﬁnd that there
are some vantage points which observe blocking of many IPs,
while other vantage points only observe a few blocked IPs.
VPSes observe a considerable amount of IP blocking, while
the blocking is more sparse in probes. Our experience suggests
that data center VPS providers could also be injecting resets
and forcing timeouts to these measurements as well. In the
residential probes, only Probe 14 observes more than 50% of IPs
being blocked, while four out of six VPSes observe more than
50% IP blocking. This seems to corroborate the hypothesis that
residential ISPs tend to block the kind of trafﬁc they see more
frequently, which is predominantly trafﬁc involving domains.

Table V: Number of subnets completely blocked by vantage
points—VPS 2 and Probe 2 block almost all of the subnets in
RUBLsub completely, while others moderately block subnets. (cid:5)
D. Characterizing Censorship of RUBLsub Measurements
Table V shows the number of subnets that were completely
unreachable from our vantage points, omitting the vantage
points where at least one IP from each subnet was reachable.
Keeping in line with our previous observations, we see that
there are some vantage points that block nearly all of the
subnets (e.g. VPS 2 and Probe 2) some that block a moderate
amount (e.g. VPS 6), and some that do very little blocking
(e.g. Probe 12) corroborating our ﬁndings in Section VI-C that
different ISPs may prioritize blocking different items in RUBL.
Similar to our observation in RUBLip, VPSes in data
centers observe much higher blocking in RUBLsub compared
to residential probes, where only Probe 2 observes a large
amount of RUBLsub blocking. Our RUBLip and RUBLsub study
suggest that most residential ISPs prefer to block using the
domain in the request, as opposed to the IP to which users
are ultimately connecting to. Further RUBLsub analysis can be
found in Appendix D
VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Russia’s move towards more restrictive Internet policies is
illuminating in the broader context of tightening information
controls around the world. Censorship studies have until this
point mostly focused on centralized networks like those in
China and Iran; Russia’s network however, like that of most
countries throughout the world, was shaped gradually by many
competitive market forces. The development of effective censors
on a decentralized network such as Russia’s raises important
questions on the future of censorship including in western
countries that have not historically favored censorship.
Our study has shown that the implementation of decen-
tralized control breaks the mold of the traditional deﬁnition
of “censorship”: a synchronized and homogeneous process
of blocking sensitive content throughout the country. While
Roskomnadzor has coordinated blocking across various ISPs
that all have independent motives, they are yet to achieve
homogeneity in the method of blocking. But with the advent of
SORM and the commoditization of censorship and surveillance
technology, it is becoming cheaper and easier for ISPs to
comply with government demands.
is no longer sufﬁcient
The variegated nature of Russia’s censorship regime has
signiﬁcant implications for censorship research moving forward.
It
to perform measurements from
one or a few vantage points within the censoring country.
Even two end-users in the same physical location may have
dramatically different experiences with censors based on their
ISP; they would both see very different results than data centers.
Measuring the actual impact of censorship also proves difﬁcult:
it requires diverse vantage points, including residential network
ISPs, infrastructural machines as well as data centers.
Decentralized control also has signiﬁcant implications for
censorship resistance and creates more barriers discovering
effective circumvention. As Russia moves to block access to
VPNs [48], users will need to rely on more exotic means of
circumvention. Since the method of blocking varies between
networks, there is increased difﬁculty in ﬁnding locally effective
circumvention tools. Techniques like refraction networking [26],
[32], [38], [86], [87] or domain fronting [23] may become
necessary. In any event, Russia has sparked an arms race in
censorship and circumvention, and its effects are likely to be
felt around the world.
We have already started to see other large nations begin
applying schemes similar to Russia’s. In the United States, ISPs
have been rolling out DPI boxes over the past decade which
can dynamically throttle connections to speciﬁc websites, [30],
[43], [49] or favor certain content over others [8]. The United
Kingdom’s censorship model is similar to Russia’s, with the
government providing ISPs a list of websites to censor [85]
and having governing bodies that correspond to various types
of censored material [75]. For both the U.S. and the U.K., what
this means is not that the current regimes are restricting the
volume of information that Russia is, but that the option to
follow the same path is cheap, readily accessible.
The same can be said for nations around the world. Portugal
has recently been cited for not supporting net neutrality [60],
Indonesia recently implemented broader content ﬁltering [34],
and India has been ramping up censorship [89]. A recent
report [80] ﬁnds that Russian information controls and the
technology used for surveillance and censorship capabilities are
being exported to at least 28 countries. As more countries move
towards stricter Internet access, Russia’s model for censorship
may become more commonplace, even in countries with a
tradition of freedom of expression on the Internet.
In conclusion, Russia’s decentralized information control
regime raises the stakes for censorship measurement and
resistance. Its censorship architecture is a blueprint, and perhaps
a forewarning of what national censorship regimes could look
like in many other countries that have similarly diverse ISP
ecosystems to Russia’s. As more countries require ISPs to
deploy DPI infrastructure for purposes of copyright enforcement
or ﬁltering pornography, we risk a slippery slope where Russian-
style censorship could easily be deployed. We hope our study
is the ﬁrst in a long line of research into the exact machinations
and implications of decentralized control. Such work may be
the only way to protect the free and open Internet.
