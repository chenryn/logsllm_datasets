E is the normalized ingress load
How many {calls, bps, GETs} do we expect?
This is a design estimate:
How much traffic is normal?
But: What does it mean to have a 
‚Äúload‚Äù of calls, when their arrivals and 
lengths are (mostly) random? 
The ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù ingress load, E:
ùõåùõå is the # of calls per unit time
This is an observation or estimate:
How many calls do we expect to arrive 
each second in our busiest hour?
ùê∏ùê∏ = ùúÜùúÜ‚Ñé
The ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù ingress load, E:
h is the average holding time
This is an observation or estimate:
How long do our calls take to service, 
on average?

This is could be due to higher-than-
expected arrival rate, or longer-than-
