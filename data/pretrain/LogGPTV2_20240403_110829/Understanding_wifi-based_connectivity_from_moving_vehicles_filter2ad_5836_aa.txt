## Abstract
Using data from VanLAN, a modest-sized testbed we have deployed, we analyze the fundamental characteristics of WiFi-based connectivity between base stations and vehicles in urban settings. Our results reveal a more complex picture than previous studies conducted in more controlled environments. The interval between a vehicle entering and leaving the range of a base station is often marred by intermittent periods of very poor connectivity, which we term "gray periods." These gray periods are difficult to predict reliably because their onset is not signaled by metrics such as signal strength, loss rate, speed, or distance from the base station. Additionally, they do not consistently occur at the same location. Our analysis suggests that gray periods are caused by the variability in the urban radio environment combined with the vehicle traversing locations with poor coverage from the base station. We also find that historical connectivity data can be used to identify regions where gray periods are more likely to occur and regions where the vehicle is likely to experience good connectivity.

## 1. Introduction
WiFi-based networks are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, with entire cities and campuses being covered [16, 15]. While it may be possible to get brief periods of connectivity [3], these networks and the WiFi technology itself are not designed to provide continuous connectivity to moving vehicles.

Like previous studies [10, 7, 3], we explore whether WiFi can be leveraged to provide connectivity (in areas of good coverage) from moving vehicles. Compared to cellular networks, which can enable such connectivity today, 802.11 has two key advantages: it operates in an unlicensed band, making it significantly cheaper, and it can support higher data rates. For example, the maximum data rate for 802.11 a/g is 54 Mbps, while EVDO Rev A offers 3.1 Mbps [6]. This difference persists with upcoming versions, with 802.11n promising 100-600 Mbps [1] and EVDO Rev B offering 9.3 Mbps [6].

However, it is unclear whether 802.11 can be effectively used for this purpose. At vehicular speeds, its short range could make it difficult to provide uninterrupted connectivity due to rapid changes in the range of base stations. The radio environment is also challenging, with high variability and interfering sources. Vehicular mobility exacerbates this, as the wireless environment changes rapidly as the vehicle moves.

To investigate feasibility, we deployed a modest-sized, WiFi-based testbed called VanLAN, which currently includes eleven base stations and two clients mounted on vans. VanLAN has been operational since January 2007. More information on the testbed and some of our measurement data is available at http://research.microsoft.com/vanlan/.

In this paper, we analyze measurements from VanLAN to understand the basic nature of WiFi-based connectivity between moving vehicles and base stations. Unlike previous work [10, 7, 3], we focus on raw connectivity rather than the performance obtained by current transport protocols and do not consider overheads such as client authentication and IP address acquisition.

Our analysis reveals a challenging environment. Instead of continuous connectivity, there are often intermittent "gray" periods of very poor connectivity. This contrasts with the three phases of connectivity—poor quality "entry" and "exit" phases and a good quality "production" phase—reported in earlier, smaller-scale studies conducted in more controlled environments [10]. We find that the occurrence of gray periods is hard to predict based on current measurements of loss rate, signal strength, speed, or distance from the base station. Gray periods do not consistently occur at the same location and are unlikely to be caused by vehicular mobility itself. Instead, they are likely due to the variability in the urban radio environment and the vehicle encountering locations with poor coverage from the base station.

On the positive side, historical performance data at a location is valuable. We find that it can be used to predict regions where gray periods are more likely and regions where connectivity is likely to be good. Combined with the predictable paths in vehicular networks, this information can help applications prepare for future conditions and mitigate the impact of uneven connectivity.

## 2. Related Work
There are numerous studies characterizing 802.11 behavior [2, 9, 4, 8, 11], but only a few analyze it in the context of vehicular mobility [10, 7, 3]. Ott and Kutscher studied the performance of UDP and TCP traffic in a carefully planned setup with two base stations along a highway (with few other WiFi users in the vicinity) [10]. They found that the connection between the car and a base station can be divided into three phases: "entry" and "exit" phases with low throughput when the car is far from the base station, and a "production" phase with high throughput when the car is close to the base station.

Gass et al. used a single base station beside a highway in a desert to study the impact of speed and backhaul network properties on application performance [7]. In this interference-free environment, they found that the wireless link was not the main bottleneck; instead, high delays in the backhaul network, on the order of 100 ms, interacted poorly with applications requiring many round-trip exchanges.

In contrast, we consider a larger-scale and more realistic urban setting with interference from 802.11 and non-802.11 sources, as well as obstacles such as trees and buildings. As a result, we find a significantly more challenging wireless environment that cannot be simply divided into three phases [10].

The CarTel study quantified the performance of uploading data from a moving car using open urban WiFi access points [3]. It found reasonable performance, with a median connection duration of 13 seconds and a median upload bandwidth of 30 KBps. However, it also found significant overheads due to association, authentication, and IP address acquisition. In contrast, we focus on the fundamental characteristics of WiFi-based connectivity.

Like VanLAN, DieselNet [5] uses a testbed of WiFi-equipped buses. However, it has a different technical focus, concentrating on delay-tolerant networks formed using vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, whereas we focus on vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity for current applications.

## 3. The VanLAN Testbed
To study the performance of 802.11 in vehicular settings, we deployed a modest-sized testbed of base stations and vehicles. We use the testbed nodes to generate and log probe traffic, which we then analyze to understand the characteristics of connectivity. Here, we describe our testbed.

VanLAN currently consists of eleven base stations and two mobile clients. The base stations are spread across five office buildings on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, WA. Their geographic placement is shown in Figure 1. The box bounds the region in which at least one packet is received by mobile clients from any base station, though the vast majority of packets are received in the right half of the box. The network of base stations is connected, but not all pairs of base stations can hear each other.

The mobile clients are vans that provide a shuttle service on and around the campus during the day. They visit the part of the campus where the base stations are present roughly ten times a day. The roads in this area are similar to urban neighborhood streets with a speed limit of around 40 km/h.

Both base stations and clients are small form factor desktops. Base stations are placed on top floors of the buildings, with their antennae mounted on the roofs. Low-loss coaxial cables connect the radios (inside the desktops) and antennae. Similarly, the clients are placed inside the vans, with their antennae mounted on the roof. The client desktops are powered by a dedicated battery, which charges when the van is on and powers the clients for about four hours after the van is switched off. This time is used for software updates through a wireless connection with another computer located near the vans' overnight parking space (base stations have Ethernet connections for this purpose).

All nodes have two radios. One radio is configured to Channel 1 of 802.11g, and the other to Channel 11. To reduce interference, the two antennae are separated by at least one foot [12]. By comparing cases where only one radio is active to where both are active, we have confirmed that any residual interference is minimal.

Our radios operate in ad hoc (IBSS) mode using a locally modified device driver. One modification forces the use of a fixed BSSID instead of a randomly generated one, preventing temporary network partitions when nodes end up with different BSSIDs. This also means that a base station and a client that come into range can start communicating immediately without waiting for their BSSIDs to be reconciled. Another modification allows us to log every received frame along with a hardware timestamp and PHY layer information such as RSSI while communicating normally (i.e., the radio is not put in "monitor" mode).

VanLAN uses the following hardware: EnGenius’ EMP-8602 modules, based on the Atheros 5213 chipset, are used as radios. Their output power is 400 mW at 1 Mbps and lower at higher transmission rates. HyperLink’s HG2403MGU antennae are used for the vans, and HGV-2404U antennae are used for the base stations. Both types are omnidirectional in the horizontal plane but radiate less energy directly above and below.

The clients also have an externally mounted GPS unit, so we know their locations. We use GlobalSat’s BU-353 GPS unit, based on the SiRF Star III chipset, which outputs data once per second. The uncertainty in the location estimate of this chipset is under three meters 95% of the time.

## 4. Connectivity Sessions
We begin our investigation by studying the basic characteristics of 802.11-based connectivity between a fixed base station and a moving vehicle. The period of connectivity between a base station and the client can be divided into sessions, where a session is a contiguous period of time in which the client can communicate with the base station. To study the properties of these sessions, we leverage beacons that 802.11 base stations send roughly every 100 ms. Using beacons instead of custom traffic allows us to consider connectivity sessions with not only VanLAN base stations but also other base stations encountered by our vans. This helps verify whether the properties of the base stations in our testbed are similar to those of other base stations in the environment. However, beacons allow us to study connectivity in only one direction—from base stations to the client.
