## Expected Behavior
Element `div` not allowed as child of `label`. See
https://i.imgur.com/XyDTf9A.png.
## Current Behavior
      A
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Navigate to https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/demos/selection-controls/
  2. Inspect the mark-up for labelled Switch
  3. Have that parsed by https://validator.w3.org
## Context
This mark-up does not follow the HTML spec: Content model for element label
and can cause issues for accessibility.  
http://w3c.github.io/html/single-page.html#the-label-element  
Phrasing content, but with no descendant labelable elements unless it is the
elementâ€™s labeled control, and no descendant label elements.
