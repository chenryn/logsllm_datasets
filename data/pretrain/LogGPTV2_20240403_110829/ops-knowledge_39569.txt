User: Please explain what is container technology? What is its main function?
Assistant: Container technology can be regarded as a virtualization technology, which can create multiple isolated operating environments in a system, called containers. These containers use system resources to run applications and services but are isolated from each other so that conflicts between applications and services are avoided. Container technology allows developers to build and run applications in different environments without worrying about system configuration or software version issues that may exist in another environment. The main role of container technology is to provide a coherent operating environment that allows applications to run on multiple platforms without any modification. Container technology can also improve resource utilization, reduce system load, and improve application reliability and security. Container technology can also speed up the development and deployment of applications, reducing time-to-market and improving responsiveness.
