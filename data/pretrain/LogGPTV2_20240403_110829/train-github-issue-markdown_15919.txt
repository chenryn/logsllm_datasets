# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
Using a test of the form
    rules: [{
      test: /\/filename.ext$/
    }]
will fail on node users in the MINGW64 / msys2 / msysgit environment because
the path separator is `\`.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
  1. Run webpack in a native Windows environment.
  2. Observe path separators are \ and not /.
  3. Observe this interacts poorly with path testing in Webpack.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Paths might have to be tested twice, once with forward slashes and once with
backslashes.
**Other relevant information:**  
webpack version: 5.32.0  
Node.js version: v16.0.0  
Operating System: Windows 10  
Additional tools: MSYS2 (i.e. the native bash provided by the Git client for
Windows)
