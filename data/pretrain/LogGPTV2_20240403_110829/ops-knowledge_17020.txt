User:  Please provide an automated deployment process based on Docker to quickly build a PDF-to-image batch processing application on CentOS 7.
Assistant: The following is an example of an automated deployment process based on Docker to quickly build a PDF-to-image batch processing application on CentOS 7: Step 1: Install Docker To install Docker on CentOS 7, you can use the following command: ``` sudo yum install docker ``` Start the Docker service: ``` sudo systemctl start docker ``` Step 2: Write Dockerfile Create a new folder and create a file called Dockerfile inside it. Write the following in the Dockerfile: ``` FROM ubuntu:18.04 RUN apt-get update \ && apt-get install -y python3-pip poppler-utils WORKDIR /app COPY . /app RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt EXPOSE 5000 CMD ["python3", "app.py"] ``` This Dockerfile defines the use of Ubuntu 18.04 as the base image, where Python3 and poppler-utils packages are installed, the working directory is configured as /app, and the application Copy to working directory, and install dependencies (read from requirements.txt file). Finally, expose the application's port 5000 to the Docker container and run the application with the CMD command. Step 3: Create an application Create a Python application, such as app.py, in the same directory as the Dockerfile, and implement the batch processing function of PDF to image in it. Step 4: Create a requirements.txt file Create a file called requirements.txt in the same directory as the Dockerfile and app.py, which contains a list of Python packages required by the application, for example: ``` Flask pdf2image ``` Step 5: Build the Docker image In the same directory as the Dockerfile, use the following command to build the Docker image: ``` sudo docker build -t pdf2img . The ``` -t parameter specifies the image name as pdf2img. Step 6: Run the Docker container Use the following command to run the Docker container: ``` sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v /path/to/pdfs:/app/pdfs pdf2img ``` The -d parameter specifies that the container is in the background Run, the -p parameter maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 of the host, and the -v parameter maps the path /path/to/pdfs on the host to the /app/pdfs directory in the container, so that the application in the container can Access PDF files. Now, the PDF-to-image batch processing application is running in the Docker container and accessed through port 5000 of the host. Drop the PDF files into the mapped host directory, then visit http://localhost:5000/ to perform batch processing operations.
