audience) provided by Facebook (Facebook calls this estimate
the “potential reach” [1]).
Table I summarizes these results, with the ﬁrst column
showing the categories present for each type of attribute
(behavior-, demographic-, or interest-based), and the second
column showing the corresponding number of targeting at-
tributes under each category. While some of these categories
such as “Hobbies and activities” may seem quite benign, others
such as “Family and relationships” may raise privacy issues in
the context of advertising. To help better understand how ﬁne-
grained the targeting attributes can be, we present a sample of
these in the ﬁrst group of rows in Table II; the second column
of the table contains the parent categories from Table I while
the fourth column contains the targeting attributes that fall
under that category. For each category, we create an audience
of users that have at least one of the targeting attributes that
fall under that category and obtain the corresponding audience
reach estimates; these are presented in the third column of
Table II. From the table, we observe that Facebook allows
advertisers to target people that are “new parents”, have an
“afﬁnity for high value goods”, are “likely to engage in politics
(conservative)”, are in an “open relationship”, etc.
In addition to the list of predeﬁned targeting attributes
described above, Facebook also computes other targeting at-
tributes that advertisers can search for by inputting free text,
and use to target users. These attributes are predominantly
interest-based attributes which correspond to “People who
have expressed an interest in or like pages” related to those
particular attributes, according to the description found in
the advertiser interface. We did not attempt to collect such
attributes as there are likely a large number of them, given
that there are millions of such pages [19].
2) Data broker targeting: This type of targeting is similar
to the traditional-Facebook targeting described above, except
for the fact that the targeting attributes are sourced from data
brokers (called Facebook Marketing Partners) instead of being
mined by Facebook; this data is obtained by Facebook by
linking their user data with data from data brokers.
The provenance information present in the metadata of each
attribute allowed us to observe that some of the predeﬁned
attributes Facebook provides come from various data brokers.
In the U.S., Facebook currently works with four data brokers:
Epsilon, DLX, Experian, and Acxiom. Table I presents the
number of targeting attributes that come from different data
brokers in the U.S. We observe from the penultimate row that
a large fraction (45%) of targeting attributes come from these
data brokers. These targeting attributes capture information
such as ﬁnancial information (e.g., income level, net worth,
purchase behaviors, charity, and use of credit cards) that is
presumably more difﬁcult for Facebook to determine from its
data alone. Each of the last four groups of rows in Table II
presents a sample of attributes sourced from a particular data
broker; many of the attributes sourced from data brokers may
also raise privacy concerns among users.
While Facebook relies mostly on online data, data brokers
aggregate information about people both from online sources
[23] as well as ofﬂine sources such as voter records, criminal
records, data from surveys and other data providers such as
automotive companies, grocery, drug stores or supermarkets
[12], [40], [3], [11].
To study how many Facebook users data brokers have
data about, for each data broker (in the U.S.), we create an
audience of users who are located in the U.S. and who have
at least one of the attributes provided by that data broker (in
the U.S.); we then obtain the corresponding audience reach
estimates provided by Facebook’s advertiser interface. The last
row of Table I presents the audience reach estimates. We were
surprised to see that almost all the data brokers have data about
5
the majority of Facebook users (i.e., their audience reach is
generally more than 100M while the audience reach using all
attributes provided by Facebook is 196M).
3) Advertiser PII targeting: Besides the traditional forms
of targeting through attribute selection, advertisers can directly
upload their own list of users they want to reach on Facebook
using the custom audience feature. Using this mechanism,
Facebook allows advertisers that have collected information
about their customer’s names and addresses (information typ-
ically asked when creating ﬁdelity cards), phone numbers, or
email addresses to target them with ads on Facebook. Using
this mechanism, advertisers can simply upload a list of phone
numbers and target people in the list. Likewise, advertisers can
target people that visited their website, installed their mobile
application, or interacted with content on their Facebook page.
To implement these features, the Facebook platform effec-
tively links advertiser-provided PII with users on Facebook.6
Note that Facebook does not reveal the corresponding Face-
book accounts to advertisers, it only gives an estimate on the
number of people in the custom audience that have an account
on Facebook.
D. Summary
Facebook has aggregated a large number of attributes about
its users, as seen from the audience reach numbers, both from
the activities of users in Facebook, and from data brokers.
Through its advertiser interface, Facebook allows advertisers
to use very ﬁne-grained and potentially sensitive attributes to
target users with ads. Thus, it is important that explanations
provide a clear view of how users are targeted and what data
Facebook has about them.
III. AUDIENCE SELECTION EXPLANATIONS
We begin by examining explanations that concern the audi-
ence selection process (see Section II-A). In other words, what
actions did the advertiser take that led to a user being shown
an ad? We call these answers ad explanations. This question
can be answered in multiple ways and with various degrees
of information. For example, an explanation such as, “you
are being shown this ad because the advertiser targets people
with accounts on Facebook” might be a potential explanation,
although not a particularly useful one. Therefore, it is critical
to analyze such explanations, as their design choices have
signiﬁcant implications on how well users understand how
their data is being used by the advertising platform. We ﬁrst
discuss possible properties of ad explanations in general, and
then investigate the explanations provided by Facebook and
their properties.
A. What is an ad explanation?
As mentioned in Section II-A, ad explanations could
provide information about the inputs (the users’ information,
actions, etc), the outputs (the inferred targeting attributes), or
the mapping function between them. The explanations could
also provide information about the advertising campaign, such
as bid amount or the optimization criteria chosen.
Facebook recently introduced a feature where users can
click on a button labeled “Why am I seeing this?” next to
each ad they are shown. Facebook then provides explanations
to the user such as
One reason you’re seeing this ad is that [advertiser]
wants to reach people interested in Facebook, based
on activity such as liking pages or clicking on ads.
There may be other reasons you’re seeing this ad,
including that [advertiser] wants to reach people
ages [age] and older who live in [location]. This
is information based on your Facebook proﬁle and
where you’ve connected to the internet.
Thus, the ad explanations that Facebook provides give some
information about the targeting attributes used by the adver-
tiser.
The ad explanation above can be separated into two parts.
In the ﬁrst part—before “There may be other reasons you’re
seeing this ad”—Facebook provides attributes asserting that
they have been used by the advertiser for the audience se-
lection. We simply call these attributes. In the second part,
Facebook provides additional attributes with the caveat that
they may have been used by advertiser—we call these potential
attributes. Most explanations that we observed (76%) can be
separated in this way (i.e., include both attributes and potential
attributes), while the remainder do not include the second part
(i.e., they have no potential attributes).7
B. Properties of ad explanations
We now examine the properties that ad explanations could
have. Let us suppose that an advertiser targeted users by
creating an audience with the following attributes:
A = (a1 AND a2) OR a3 OR ¬a4
and that we have four users with the following at-
tributes U1 = {a1, a2, a991, a992}, U2 = {a3, a993, a994},
U3 = {¬a4, a995}, U4 = {a1, a2, a996}. There are a number
of properties that the platform’s ad explanations could satisfy:
a) Correctness: We say that an explanation is correct
if every attribute and potential attribute listed has been used
by the advertiser. In our example, only a1, a2, a3, or ¬a4
should appear in the explanation if it is to be correct. However,
because of potential attributes, not all explanations that do not
meet this deﬁnition are incorrect. Speciﬁcally, we say that
an explanation is incorrect if there exists an attribute listed
that was actually not used by the advertiser. We say that an
explanation is misleading if all of its attributes listed were used
by the advertiser, but there exists a potential attribute listed that
was not used by the advertiser. Thus, we note that a misleading
explanation is neither correct nor incorrect.
In our example, an explanation with attributes a1 and
a2 and potential attribute a997 is misleading, as a997 was
6Investigating the accuracy of such matching is important—but beyond the
scope of this paper—as previous work showed that matching at large scale is
often inaccurate [25].
7While placing our own ads, we found that the explanations without the
second part only occurred when we selected no targeting attributes beyond
age, gender, and location.
6
not speciﬁed by the advertiser. However, if the explanation
included a997 as an attribute (rather than a potential attribute),
we would then call the explanation incorrect. Fortunately, for
the remaining properties, we do not need to make the distinc-
tion between attributes and potential attributes; the attributes
mentioned next can be of either type.
b) Personalization: Ad explanations can either be non-
personalized (i.e., the explanation is the same for all users
that received the ad) or personalized (i.e., the explanation
differs from user to user). Using our example above, one
non-personalized ad explanation would be to report all of the
attributes speciﬁed by the advertiser. In contrast, personalized
ad explanations might only show the attributes that are spec-
iﬁed by the advertiser that also match the user. For example,
U1’s explanation might be {a1, a2}, U2’s might be {a3}, etc.
Personalized ad explanations may be more useful for users
who want to only know why they were shown the ad, but non-
personalized explanations might be more useful for users who
want to know more about the set of all users who the advertiser
was targeting.
c) Completeness: A complete ad explanation should
list all the attributes a1, a2, a3,¬a4 for non-personalized ad
explanations, while for personalized ad explanations, it should
list the entire subset of a1, a2, a3,¬a4 attributes for which
Facebook has information about the user.
A succinct (incomplete, yet useful) ad explanation would
limit the number of listed attributes to the most important
ones, for some useful notion of “importance.” We will see
later in the section that Facebook currently shows only one
attribute in each ad explanation, regardless of the number
of attributes used by the advertiser. Succinct ad explanations
might be preferred over complete ad explanations if users are
overwhelmed by a large number of attributes that appear in the
explanation. However, constructing succinct ad explanations
requires ranking the importance of attributes. Among other
criteria, such a ranking could be based on:
(1) an attribute’s rarity in the entire Facebook user population
(i.e., based on the fraction of Facebook users that have that
attribute); intuitively, if 90% of users on Facebook have a1 and
only 1% have a2, including attribute a2 in the ad explanation
would be more informative than including a1.
(2) an attribute’s perceived sensitivity; having a particular
political leaning may be a more prevalent feature than playing
tennis, but the former might be more privacy sensitive than the
latter. Moreover, the perceived sensitivity of an attribute varies
from user to user, so a personalized explanation may be able
to capture different users’ rankings.
d) Consistency: In the case of personalized ad explana-
tions, the platform could ensure consistent explanations across
users who match the same subset of attributes. In our example
above, the ad explanations given to users U1 and U4 would
need to be the same if the platform provided consistent ad
explanations.
e) Determinism: Finally, deterministic ad explanations
would give the same ad explanation to a user for all ads that
were placed with the same targeting attributes. On the contrary,
non-deterministic ad explanations may cycle through multiple
explanations at different times. Note that non-deterministic
ad explanations might be necessary if ad explanations are
personalized and the input data Facebook has about a user
changes over time.
In the rest of the section, we analyze Facebook’s ad
explanations based on the properties deﬁned above.
C. Measurement methodology
To study the ad explanations that Facebook provides, we
wrote a browser extension that gathers ad explanations for all
the ads received by users on Facebook. To check the properties
of ad explanations, we conduct controlled ad campaigns that
target volunteers who installed the browser extension, gather
the ad explanations provided, and check which attributes are
represented in the ad explanations.
1) Browser extension to collect ad explanations: We de-
velop a browser extension for Chrome that records the ads the
users receive whenever they browse Facebook, as well as the
respective explanations that Facebook provides. Once an ad
appears, it is captured by the extension and forwarded to a
server we control. We detect the ads based on speciﬁc unique
characteristics, such as the “Sponsored” tag, that make them
different from other posts. Ads can either appear as posts in
the user’s feed—called front ads—or can appear on the right
of the screen—called side ads.
We also capture the ad explanation URL that is linked
to by a “Why am I seeing this?” button on each ad. Face-
book imposes a rate limit for the requests to these URLs.
Speciﬁcally, usually after 10 requests/hour, the service stops
delivering explanations for some time. Thus, we send the
explanation URL requests to a scheduler that does not make
more than 10 requests/hour. Moreover, to avoid unnecessary
requests (while allowing us to study consistency), once we
collect an explanation for a particular ad for a given user, we
do not collect the explanation for the same ad if shown again
to the same user for a period of two days. The process does not
interfere with the browsing experience of the user. Moreover,
the number of requests we make to Facebook is trivial when
compared to the number of requests that take place when a
user browses Facebook.
We collect ads and explanations from 35 users for a total
of 5 months (accumulated across all the users). We recruit
users by advertising our browser extension on a personal basis
to our co-workers and families. In total, we collect 26,173
unique ads and their corresponding ad explanations; we refer
to this dataset as the AD-DATASET.
