# Remap shortcut to support character keys
## Feature Request for Keyboard Manager
### Context
Hi, only recently came across PowerToys and already fond of the wealth of
utilities present. Many thanks for making these available!
Due to limited hand mobility, I’m heavily reliant on key-remapping and macros
for keyboard interaction. As such, SharpKeys and AutoHotkey are ideal for
remapping keys on a registry-level and scripting complex macros, respectively.
I don’t expect Keyboard Manager to have feature parity with either of these
dedicated solutions; I’m drawing inspiration from them. For example,
AutoHotkey supports mouse input which is super-useful to me (worth raising a
different feature request? :).
### Summary
As part of **Remap shortcuts** , I was surprised to find it could only remap
to another shortcut starting with a modifier key. What about remapping
shortcuts to another key‽ Such as `Alt` \+ `?` = `‽`. Or `Alt` \+ `Left |
Right` = `← | →`.
Additionally, as per the examples, I don’t even see any way to map to the
chosen Unicode characters. Is there any plans to allow inclusion of the wider
Unicode characters range?
Thanks for your time, really appreciate it.
