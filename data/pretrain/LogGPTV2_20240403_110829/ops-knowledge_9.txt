User: I cannot get jupyter running from my Command line using:
jupyter notebook

jupyter is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable
  program or batch file'

But I can get it running from pycharm (slick but with issues). When I take the kernel's IP and Port from pycharm and paste it into my browser I can get it running from there. 
I cannot use anaconda because of Arcpy, and I have dug around the jupyter files for some hints.
I'm assuming I need to add something to my path?
Assistant: If you use Python 3, try running the command from your virtual environment and or Anaconda command instead of your computer's OS CMD.
