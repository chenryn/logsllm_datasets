## Issue description
When I compile external C++ app with CMake using Caffe2 dependency, ATen
header is missing.
> fatal error: ATen/core/Macros.h: No such file or directory
Seems like ATen headers are not properly copied to /usr/local/include while
other headers are well installed.  
Reproduced with Caffe2 with Ubuntu 16.04/CUDA 8/CuDNN 7 Dockerfile here.
I was able to resolve the issue by adding the following line to the
Dockerfile.
> RUN cp -RL /usr/pytorch/aten/src/ATen /usr/local/include/
## Code example
I used /usr/local/include as my Caffe2 include directory in my
FindCaffe2.cmake as below.
> find_path(Caffe2_INCLUDE_DIR NAMES caffe2 onnx google eigen3 ATen HINTS
> /usr/local/include)
I include four header files in my app, and it makes compile error.
> #include   
>  #include   
>  #include   
>  #include
