The waypoint requires the margin to be specified in a clockwise notation as 20px 20px 20px 40px. However, it only functions correctly when the margin is set as 40px 20px 20px 40px. 

For clarity, the correct order for the margin values should be: top, right, bottom, and left. In this case, the intended margin (20px 20px 20px 40px) does not work, but using 40px 20px 20px 40px resolves the issue.
