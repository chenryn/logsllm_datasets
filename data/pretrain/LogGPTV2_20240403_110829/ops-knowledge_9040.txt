Assistant: It is recommended to use the Zoom video conferencing system. 1. Multi-party participation capability: Zoom supports up to 1,000 participants to participate in video conferences at the same time, which can easily meet the needs of a large number of participants in conference rooms or distributed teams. 2. Screen sharing: Zoom has a powerful screen sharing function, which can share the entire screen or selected applications, and can mark and comment on the shared screen, making it easier for participants to understand the presentation content. 3. Recording playback: Zoom can easily record meetings and store the recordings in the cloud. This means that meeting minutes can be played back at any time so that participants and others can review and refer to them as needed. In conclusion, Zoom is an easy-to-use and powerful video conferencing system that can meet the needs of most companies.
