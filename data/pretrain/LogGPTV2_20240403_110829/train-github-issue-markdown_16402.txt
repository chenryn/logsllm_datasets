Now that universal Webpack (#3578) is released, there's a great opportunity to
streamline custom servers using Next. Having the ability to write in a
consistent syntax (whether ES6+ or TypeScript) between client and server code
would greatly benefit the developer experience. I find it sort of awkward that
a custom server entry point has to remain compatible with whatever your
current version of Node is. I created a work-around as a Next plugin, but I
find it hacky and awkward. I can't imagine it would be too much work to build
a server bundle separately from the client bundle. What can I do to help this
along?
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
When I run `next dev` or `next start`, my custom server is bundled via Webpack
and served, enabling consistent syntax across the client and custom server
code.
## Current Behavior
A custom server is started using `node ./path/to/server.js`, so Webpack never
touches it.
## Context
I usually write in TypeScript, so bundling Next custom server code through
Webpack would enforce consistent syntax in my code base and eliminate my
dependency on ESLint or Babel.
