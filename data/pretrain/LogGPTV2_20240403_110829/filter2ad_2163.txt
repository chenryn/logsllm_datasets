**Keynote Talk: Protocol Design for Effective Communication among Silicon or Carbon-based Nodes**

**Bio:**
Radia Perlman is a Fellow at Intel Labs, where her research focuses on network and security technologies. She began her career in networking at BBN, where she designed routing protocols for packet radio networks. Later, she moved to Digital, where she was responsible for designing the routing protocols for DECnet. Her innovations significantly enhanced the robustness and scalability of link state routing protocols. The specific protocol she designed for DECnet was adopted by ISO and renamed as IS-IS, which remains widely used today, virtually unchanged over the past 20 years.

Perlman also developed the spanning tree algorithm, which is central to modern Ethernet. Approximately seven years ago, she designed a protocol to replace the spanning-tree Ethernet with true routing. This protocol, known as TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links), is compatible with existing switches and routers. It allows any subset of bridges in a bridged Ethernet to be replaced with RBridges (routing bridges). The network still appears as a single flat Ethernet (a single IP subnet), but the more bridges that are replaced, the more stable the network becomes, and the better the bandwidth utilization. TRILL is currently being standardized by the IETF.

In addition to her contributions to networking, Perlman has made significant advancements in security, including network designs resilient to malicious trusted components, assured delete, strong password protocols, and authorization models. She is the author of "Interconnections" and co-author of "Network Security," both of which are widely used in academia and industry. Perlman holds a PhD in Computer Science from MIT and an honorary doctorate from KTH. She was recently awarded the USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award.

**Abstract:**
In this talk, I will share some key lessons I have learned about network protocol design. I will discuss how to create self-stabilizing protocols, self-configuring networks, and optional configurations that do not cause harm if misconfigured. I will also address the challenges of designing within constraints such as backward compatibility and political considerations. Additionally, I will present some of my recent work, including the rationale behind designing a Layer 2.5 protocol, given that forwarding is already performed at both Layers 2 and 3. Drawing from my extensive experience in computer network communication protocol design, I will also offer insights into how communication protocols in other domains could be improved.
