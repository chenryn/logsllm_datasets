Bio
Radia Perlman is a Fellow at Intel Labs, where her research fo-
cuses on network and security technologies. She started her career
in networking at BBN, designing routing protocols for the packet
radio network. Then she moved to Digital, where she was respon-
sible for designing routing for DECnet. Her innovations made link
state routing protocols robust and scalable. The speci(cid:2)c protocol
she designed for DECnet was adopted by ISO and renamed IS-
IS, and remains in wide use today, virtually unchanged in the last
20 years. She also designed the spanning tree algorithm which is
the heart of modern Ethernet. About 7 years ago she designed a
protocol to replace spanning-tree Ethernet with true routing. It is
compatible with today’s switches and routers, in the sense that any
subset of the bridges in a bridged Ethernet can be replaced with
the new RBridges ((cid:147)routing bridges(cid:148)). The network still appears
as a single (cid:3)at Ethernet (a single IP subnet), but the more bridges
replaced, the more stable the network becomes, and the better the
bandwidth utilization. This design is the basis for the TRILL proto-
col (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links), which is being
standardized by IETF.
She has also made signi(cid:2)cant contributions to security, including
network designs resilient to malicious trusted components, assured
delete, strong password protocols, and authorization models.
She is the author of (cid:147)Interconnections(cid:148), and coauthor of (cid:147)Net-
work Security(cid:148), both texts widely used in both academia and in-
dustry. She has PhD in computer science from MIT, and an hon-
orary doctorate from KTH. She was recently awarded the USENIX
lifetime achievement award.
Abstract
In this talk I will discuss some of the lessons I’ve discovered about
network protocol design; how to make protocols self-stabilizing,
how to make networks self-con(cid:2)guring, how to provide optional
con(cid:2)guration in such a way that miscon(cid:2)guration does no harm,
and how to design within constraints such as backward compati-
bility and politics. I’ll also talk about some of my recent work. It
is confusing enough that forwarding is done at both layers 2 and
3. Why am I designing a layer 2 1/2? And having spent most of
my life in the world of computer network communication protocol
design, I will share my observations about ways in which commu-
nication protocols in other areas could be improved.
