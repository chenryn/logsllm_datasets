1 INTRODUCTION
The Information Revolution has thoroughly transformed society.
One of the major implications of this technological shift has been a
massive increase in the collection, sharing, and analysis of personal
data. The goal of this workshop is to discuss the privacy problems
that result as well as their solutions. This is the 17th occurrence of
this annual forum, which is held in conjunction with the ACM CCS
conference.
The workshop seeks submissions from academia, government,
and industry presenting novel research on all theoretical and prac-
tical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies
of fielded systems. We encourage submissions from other commu-
nities such as law and business that present these communities’
perspectives on technological issues. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:
• attacks on data privacy
• bias and fairness in machine learning
