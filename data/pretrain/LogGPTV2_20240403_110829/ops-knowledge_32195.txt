Question: Why is padding not required for the last block of plaintext in CTR mode as opposed to CBC mode when encrypting messages that are not a multiple of the block size?
"A": "CTR mode uses a stream cipher approach, avoiding the need for input to be a fixed block size.",
"B": "CTR mode generates a one-time pad that can be truncated without compromising the encryption.",
"C": "CTR mode includes an internal padding mechanism that automatically adjusts block sizes.",
"D": "CTR mode encryption strength is not dependent on the block size, so padding is optional."
Answer: B
