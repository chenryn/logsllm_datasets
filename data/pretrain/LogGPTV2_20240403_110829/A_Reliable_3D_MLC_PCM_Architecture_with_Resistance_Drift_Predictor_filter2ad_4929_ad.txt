A. Bit Error Rate
Sources of error in time- and temperature-aware sensing:
Our scheme has two sources of error. First as explained
before, since we use last values of the sensors for calculating
resistance drift, there is inaccurate estimation in some cases.
Second, in contrast to conventional approaches, the other
source of drift-induced errors in the proposed 3D MLC PCM
architecture relates to the resolution of quantization. Since
the values of time and temperature are continuous, in order
to evaluate drift law, we use samples of those and store the

calculated results in SBT. We have to use approximate values
to estimate the border of states for other inter-sample times
and temperatures. This approximation makes our system
susceptible to errors of quantization shown in Fig. 9. As
can be seen in Fig. 9 (a), if drift controller unit uses Ô¨Çoor
values of time-tags and temperature sensors for quantization,
it is possible that resistance of the cell intrudes the next
state. In other words drift controller unit has taken the lower
amount of drift into account for estimating new borders. This
lower estimation accuracy leads to wrong state interpretation
of the cell. On the other hand, if we use ceiling values
of temperature sensors and time-tags, this overestimation
may lead to interpreting cell resistance as its previous state.
This type of error is shown in Fig. 9 (b). It is clear that

there is a trade-off between rates of uncorrectable soft errors
and area/latency/energy overheads, because of quantization
resolution.
Experiment: We compare the reliability potential of the
proposed adaptive sensing schemes by evaluating bit error
rates. Evaluating the error rate changes over wide ranges
of time and temperature for a large memory system is
challenging, since it requires time consuming simulations.
To make this practical, we ignore accurate full-system sim-
ulation and examine bit error rate for a single 128B PCM
line. We model variability in cell resistance by employing
the process variation model described above and assume
probability of 50% for drift-prone patterns (‚Äú10‚Äù, ‚Äú00‚Äù).
We use Monte-Carlo simulation and generate time and
temperature according to normal distribution with mean and
deviation, time=N (100, 900) and temperature=N (65, 10) 1.
Then, we quantize the values of time and temperature with
different resolutions and evaluate the resistance drift with
exact and quantized values of time and temperature. Based
on the result of Fig. 8, in 15% of all experiments we generate
temperatures that have 5 ‚ó¶C difference with exact values to
consider Ô¨Årst type of error in our proposal. Finally, we count
the number of errors in this experiment. In Table VI, error
rates for different resolutions of time and temperature have
been reported.
Discussion: As we use Gray code for adjacent cells in 2-bit
MLC cells, maximally 1-bit error will be observed for each
overlapped state. As can be seen in Table VI, our proposed
system shows bit error rate (BER) in range of 2.18√ó 10‚àí12
to 4.8 √ó 10‚àí7. If 2-ECC or 4-ECC was used, rate of error
could have considerably reduced. For example, in Table VI,
for time resolution of 1 second and temperature resolution of
1 ‚ó¶C, BER from 1.94√ó10‚àí8 is reduced to 6.15√ó10‚àí10 with
2 ECC bits or 2.18√ó10‚àí12 with 4 ECC bits, hence exploiting
1We use these two distributions to cover temperature range from 35
to 95 and time from 10 to 190 seconds. Our results show no signiÔ¨Åcant
differences for other distributions, because error rate of our system strongly
depends on the resolution of quantization, not time and temperature.
simple error correction codes like Hamming is very effective.
Based on discussion in [27], the best case of bit error rate
in simple 2-bit MLC PCM is 10‚àí3 to 10‚àí1 that could be
reduced to 7√ó10‚àí4 to 10‚àí2 by using a time-aware approach.
The baseline BER will be improved to 6.74 √ó 10‚àí5, if the
Scrubbing mechanism is employed [2]. Hence if the best
resolution of quantization is used, compared to these two
solutions (Time-aware and Scrubbing), our proposal shows
108 and 107 better BERs, respectively. On the other hand,
the bit error rate of three-level PCM is in range of 2.28 √ó
10‚àí16 to 5.71√ó10‚àí10 that shows better reliability but it must
be noted that the BER of our system is time independent
and we keep 2-bit per cell density in high thermal stress
environment. Also, our technique can be applied to more
than 2-bit MLC density while three-level scheme is only
applicable for 2-bit cell PCM.
B. Energy dissipation and Performance
In order to accurately estimate energy dissipation and
performance, we need to determine the overhead of our
proposed technique. Accordingly, we tabulated the overhead
of Ô¨Åve systems with different levels of reliability in Table
VII. Despite the fact that temperature has a limited range of
diversity (from ambient to 100 ‚ó¶C), time may have inÔ¨Ånite
values. Hence, we assume one refresh per day and restrict
the time values from 0 up to 86400 seconds (one day). For
different time and temperature resolutions, we can obtain
storage capacity of SBT by:
Size = M axtime
T ime res. √ó M ax temp‚àíAmbient
T emp. res
√ó3√ólength(V ref )
where length(V ref ) refers to the length of each threshold
voltage in binary format in read circuit (assuming 16 bits).
Also, we set M axT emp = 100 ‚ó¶C and M axT ime = 1day.
For various sizes of SBT, energy dissipation and latency
per access can be provided by CACTI [20].
Energy dissipation. The proposed system increases the
inter-level margins for tolerating about %50 to 60% of
