User:  You need to configure an SSL certificate for a web application. Please provide the method for obtaining the certificate and the specific steps for configuring SSL.
Assistant: How to obtain a certificate: 1. Purchase a commercial SSL certificate. SSL certificates can be purchased from a certificate authority (CA) such as Digicert, Symantec, Comodo, etc., because the SSL certificates they provide are verified. 2. Go to a free SSL certificate authority, such as Let's Encrypt, choose a certificate that suits you and apply for issuance. Steps to configure SSL: 1. Obtain an SSL certificate. Either generate a certificate from a certificate authority or generate it yourself. 2. Install the certificate. Upload the certificate to the web server and install it. 3. Configure the web server. To enable SSL, you need to change the web server's configuration file. Depending on your environment and web server, the steps may vary. 4. Restart the web server. Save the changes and restart the web server for the changes to take effect. 5. Check if SSL is enabled. Visit your website by typing https:// (instead of http://) in your browser, check for the lock icon, if it appears, SSL has been successfully enabled.
