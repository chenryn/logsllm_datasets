User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Should users be allowed to login with the same password when a password change is requested but not changed? I have noticed that some sites would not let you login with the old password if a new password is requested, but was not changed. 

Example: I forgot my password and requested a new one in the email. Received the email to reset it, clicked on it and then while typing, I remembered the old password. So I cancel the page and go back to the login page. However, it would not let me login with the old password as I have requested a password change. 

What compromises are made possible if we let the users login with the old password, instead of making them change the password?

Assistant: Yes, you should allow users to log in using the old password until they have changed the password. Otherwise it would be possible to lock users out of their account by requesting a password reset for them.
