## Abstract
Big data workflow management systems (BDWFMSs) have emerged as popular platforms for performing large-scale data analytics in the cloud. However, ensuring data confidentiality and secure execution of workflow applications remains a significant and challenging problem. While some data analytics systems address this issue, they are often limited to specific structures like Map-Reduce-style workflows and SQL queries. This paper introduces SecDATAVIEW, a BDWFMS that leverages Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) and AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) to create a heterogeneous trusted execution environment for workflows. SecDATAVIEW aims to:
1. Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of code and data for workflows running on public, untrusted clouds.
2. Minimize the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size for a BDWFMS.
3. Enable a trade-off between security and performance for workflows.
4. Support the execution of Java-based workflow tasks in SGX.

Our experimental results show that SecDATAVIEW imposes an overhead of 1.69x to 2.62x on workflow execution time on SGX worker nodes, 1.04x to 1.29x on SEV worker nodes, and 1.20x to 1.43x in a heterogeneous setting using both SGX and SEV worker nodes.

## 1. Introduction
Scientific workflows increasingly utilize cloud computing to provision on-demand scalable resources for large-scale big data analytics [30, 37]. Cloud computing offers the advantage of providing practically unlimited resources based on a pay-as-you-go model, enabling scientific workflows to solve larger problems and address big data challenges (volume, velocity, and variety) more efficiently. This has led to the concept of big data scientific workflows, or simply big data workflows.

However, cloud hardware resources are typically shared among different users or organizations through isolation techniques such as virtual machines or containers. This sharing characteristic and the large size of the cloud's system software make it vulnerable to various attacks [2, 14, 34, 45, 50, 57]. For example, Ristenpart et al. [49] demonstrated that an outside adversary could extract unauthorized information from AWS EC2 instances. Additionally, big data workflows running on clouds or virtualized data centers rely on the integrity of the OS and hypervisor code, which introduces a large Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Vulnerabilities in the TCB can be exploited by adversaries, including malicious insiders such as dishonest administrators or high-privileged malicious cloud software.

Hardware-assisted Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer a promising solution to protect the execution of big data workflows and their data. Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) [5, 24, 42] and AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) [29] are two widely used general-purpose hardware-assisted TEEs for the x86 architecture. The pros and cons of these technologies are discussed in [43].

Intel SGX has been used to protect big data analytics in the cloud. For instance, Shuster et al. [9] proposed VC3, a system that leverages SGX to protect unmodified Map-Reduce tasks written in C/C++. Pires et al. [46] proposed a lightweight Map-Reduce framework with Lua, interpreting Map-Reduce Lua scripts in Intel SGX. Zheng et al. [61] proposed Opaque, which enhances the security of Spark SQL with SGX. Although these systems are pioneers in using hardware-assisted security for big data analytics, they are limited to specific domains. For example, the systems by Shuster et al. [9] and Pires et al. [46] support only Map-Reduce-style workflows, while Opaque is limited to relational algebra-based tasks with Spark SQL.

In this paper, we propose SecDATAVIEW, a secure big data workflow management system that leverages Intel SGX and AMD SEV to provide a heterogeneous TEE for big data workflows. SecDATAVIEW is transparent to users and application-level workflow tasks and addresses the following challenges:

1. **Reducing TCB Size**: Scientific workflows running on clouds or virtualized data centers rely on the integrity of the OS and hypervisor code, introducing a large TCB. For example, the Linux kernel has about 35.5 million lines of code, and the latest Xen hypervisor contains 572,000 lines of code [11]. This large TCB creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. To address this, SecDATAVIEW isolates security-sensitive modules in SGX-protected enclaves or SEV-protected instances, keeping high-privileged cloud system software outside the TCB.

2. **Supporting Java Tasks**: SGX is compatible with only a limited set of C/C++ libraries, but many workflow tasks are written in Java and use third-party Java libraries, which SGX does not directly support. SecDATAVIEW uses the shielding approach proposed in [8] and the SGX-LKL library OS [15, 40] to execute Java-based workflow tasks in secure enclaves. Alternatively, it uses AMD SEV to provide protected worker nodes during workflow runtime.

3. **Handling Memory-Intensive Workflows**: Big data workflow tasks are often memory-intensive. For example, 75% of the execution time of the Broadband workflow [20] is consumed by tasks requiring over 1GB of memory. Running the kernel of a workflow management system such as DATAVIEW [30] itself requires over 500MB of memory. In SGX-protected workflows, when tasks require a large amount of secure memory, the SGX Enclave Page Cache (EPC) memory paging can significantly increase execution time. SecDATAVIEW addresses this by using SEV-protected instances, which provide a larger amount of secure memory than SGX enclaves.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
- We propose SecDATAVIEW, a secure big data workflow management system that leverages Intel SGX and AMD SEV for the secure execution of big data workflows. We introduce a secure architecture and the WCPAC (Workflow Code Provisioning and Communication) protocol to provision and attest secure worker nodes, securely provision the code for the Task Executor and workflow tasks on each participating worker node, establish secure communication between the master node and worker nodes, and ensure secure file transfers among worker nodes. We leverage the SGX-shielding approach and the SGX-LKL library OS to execute Java-based workflow tasks.
- To support memory-intensive workflows and reduce the overall performance overhead incurred by SGX enclaves EPC memory paging, SecDATAVIEW allows users to selectively assign confidential tasks to SGX or SEV worker nodes. Researchers in [43] reported that SEV performs faster than SGX for workloads requiring a larger amount of secure memory. However, SGX offers better security due to its smaller TCB size, enclave abstraction, and memory integrity protection. In SecDATAVIEW, users can run memory-intensive confidential tasks in SEV worker nodes while assigning security-sensitive confidential tasks to SGX worker nodes.
- We have implemented SecDATAVIEW and conducted experiments on real-world workflows, including a diagnosis recommendation workflow [3], a Map-Reduce workflow [16], and a distributed K-means workflow, to demonstrate the feasibility and usability of the proposed system. Our experimental results show that SecDATAVIEW imposes a moderate overhead on the execution times of various workflows. The source code of SecDATAVIEW is available on GitHub [1] for further research and improvement.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of big data, the DATAVIEW workflow management system, Intel SGX and AMD SEV technologies, and the adversary model. Section 3 presents the architecture design and communication protocol implementation of SecDATAVIEW. Section 4 presents our experimental results. Related work is discussed in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. Background and Adversary Model

### Big Data Workflows
A big data workflow is a computerized model for automating a data analytics process, consisting of a set of computational tasks and their data inter-dependencies to process and analyze data of increasing scale, complexity, and rate of acquisition [30, 33]. A big data workflow management system (BDWFMS) defines, modifies, manages, monitors, and executes scientific workflows on the cloud, driven by the workflow logic [30, 33]. An example of a workflow is shown in Figure 6, which is a well-known word count (Map-Reduce) workflow.

SecDATAVIEW was developed based on the DATAVIEW scientific workflow management system [30]. The architecture of DATAVIEW is given in Figure 1. We chose DATAVIEW as our BDWFMS for the following reasons:
- DATAVIEW represents the state-of-the-art big data workflow management system.
- It has a strong user base, with over 700 registered users worldwide.
- DATAVIEW has been used in various data analytics applications, including diagnosis recommendation [3], predicting the efficacy of therapeutic services for autism spectrum disorder [10], analysis of vehicle data to assess driver’s driving behavior [31], medical image processing [22], biological simulation data analysis [19], and brain fiber connectivity analysis [36].

DATAVIEW consists of three layers:
- **Presentation & Visualization Layer**: Responsible for presenting workflows and visualizing data products and provenance metadata.
- **Workflow Management Layer**: Includes the Workflow Design & Configuration module, which provides an intuitive GUI for designing and configuring workflows, and the Workflow Engine, which orchestrates the execution of workflows. The Workflow Monitoring module tracks the status of workflow execution.
- **Task Management Layer**: Enables the execution of heterogeneous atomic tasks, including web services and scripts, and tasks executed on VMs in the cloud. The Cloud Resource Management module interacts with virtual resources in clouds and data centers.

Using DATAVIEW, users can easily share data and workflows with collaborators and design and run big data scientific workflows in the cloud, including commercial Amazon EC2 and academic clouds.

### Intel SGX
Intel SGX is a hardware innovation that enables users to instantiate a secure container, called an enclave, to protect the execution of code from being altered by malicious code or external threats. The enclave provides a secure environment for sensitive computations and data, even on untrusted platforms.

### AMD SEV
AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is a hardware feature that encrypts the memory of virtual machines, providing an additional layer of security against attacks that target the hypervisor or host operating system. SEV ensures that the memory contents of a virtual machine are protected from unauthorized access, even if the hypervisor is compromised.

### Adversary Model
The adversary model in SecDATAVIEW considers both external and internal threats. External threats include unauthorized access to data and workflow tasks, while internal threats include malicious insiders such as dishonest administrators or high-privileged cloud software. The goal of SecDATAVIEW is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of code and data in the presence of these threats.
