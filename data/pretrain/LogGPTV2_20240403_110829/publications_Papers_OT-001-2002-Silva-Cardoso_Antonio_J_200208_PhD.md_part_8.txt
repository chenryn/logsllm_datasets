### 2.7.2 COMPUTING QoS METRICS

Domain experts believe there is a strong correlation between the Quality of Service (QoS) exhibited during the execution of the "Prepare and Sequence" and "Sequence Processing" workflows and the expected QoS of tasks scheduled by the DNA Sequencing workflow. This belief is based on the fact that the tasks executed in the initial workflows will be executed without any changes in the newly constructed workflow. The following functions (see Table 2-5) have been used to recompute QoS metrics based on both design-time and runtime information:

**Table 2-12: Re-computation of QoS Dimensions for the DNA Sequencing Workflow**

1. **QoS(t)**:
   \[
   \text{QoS}_{\text{Dim}}(t) = 0.2 \times \text{Designer Average}_{\text{Dim}}(t) + 0.8 \times \text{Multi-Workflow Average}_{\text{Dim}}(t)
   \]

2. **QoS(t, w)**:
   \[
   \text{QoS}_{\text{Dim}}(t, w) = 0.2 \times \text{Designer Average}_{\text{Dim}}(t) + 0.2 \times \text{Multi-Workflow Average}_{\text{Dim}}(t) + 0.6 \times \text{Workflow Average}_{\text{Dim}}(t, w)
   \]

To represent the QoS agreement among tasks from different workflows, domain experts have set the weights as follows:

- For formula b), the experts believe that the recorded QoS of previously executed tasks will provide good estimates for the new workflow. Thus, they set the weights \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \) to 0.2 and 0.8, respectively.
- For formula c), the experts believe that once tasks are scheduled by the new workflow, the QoS estimates should rely more on the latest QoS data from the DNA Sequencing workflow. They also consider that when QoS data from the DNA Sequencing workflow is available, the importance given to designer estimates should be equal to the QoS estimates from other workflows. Therefore, they set the weights \( w_1 \), \( w_2 \), and \( w_3 \) to 0.2, 0.2, and 0.6, respectively.

In our experiments, we only predict workflow QoS metrics before the workflow execution, not during it. Hence, we did not set the weights for formula c) from Table 2-6.

Since the new workflow includes a loop that was not present in the previously executed workflows, it is necessary to estimate the probability of the transition (Test Quality, Prepare Sample) being enabled at runtime. Based on prior knowledge of sequencing experiments, researchers calculate that approximately 10% of the DNA sequences will contain E. coli bacteria, resulting in a 10% probability of the loop back transition being enabled.

### 2.7.3 RESULTS

We conducted ten experiments, each involving the execution of the SWR algorithm to predict QoS metrics of the DNA Sequencing workflow and the actual execution of the workflow. The results for the four QoS dimensions (Time, Cost, Reliability, and Fidelity) are shown in Figures 2-13, 2-14, 2-15, and 2-16, respectively. The diamonds indicate the QoS estimates given by the SWR algorithm, and the squares indicate the runtime metrics.

For the time analysis, the most relevant observation is that instances 3 and 4 have significantly different actual running times compared to the estimated values. This is due to the workflow topology, where some DNA sequences may contain E. coli contamination, requiring re-work. The first part of the workflow, which involves the tasks "Prepare Sample," "Prepare Clone and Sequence," and "Assembly," takes approximately 99% of the overall execution time. When E. coli contamination is present, the workflow execution time almost doubles. Since it is impossible to know if a sequence contains E. coli, the SWR algorithm's estimate for instance 3 differs significantly from the actual value. For instance 4, the QoS metrics from the previous instance are considered, and the SWR estimation converges to the mean of recent time metrics. If more instances detect E. coli, the SWR algorithm's time estimates will gradually converge to around 550 hours. Instances 5 through 10 do not detect contamination, leading to more accurate and lower time estimates.

The cost analysis shows similar patterns, with instances 3 and 4 having significantly different actual costs due to E. coli contamination. The cost of an instance is determined by the tasks involved in re-work, and the cost is either \( c \) or \( 2c \) depending on whether re-work is needed. This property can be observed in the chart, where instances with no re-work have a consistent cost of $1,152, and those needing re-work have a cost of $2,304.

The fidelity analysis shows that the SWR algorithm consistently adjusts its convergence in response to recently recorded QoS metrics, with runtime fidelity metrics within a small range.

The reliability analysis is straightforward. The SWR algorithm initially uses designer-specified information, suggesting a 99.4% reliability. However, all ten instances executed successfully, leading to a 100% reliability value. The reliability estimates from the SWR algorithm slowly converge to 100%. It is expected that as more instances are executed, the reliability of the DNA Sequencing workflow will decrease.

### 2.8 RELATED WORK

The literature on quality of service for Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) is limited. The Crossflow project has made significant contributions, using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) to calculate time and cost associated with workflow executions. While research on WfMS QoS is limited, time management, a subset of workflow QoS, has been more active. Eder et al. and Pozewaunig et al. extend CMP and PERT by annotating workflow graphs with time, but their approach is limited to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Our approach handles both acyclic and cyclic workflows, which are common in real-world applications.

Dadam et al. recognize the importance of time in workflow execution, allowing the specification and monitoring of deadlines. Marjanovic and Orlowska describe a workflow model with constructs and algorithms for checking temporal constraint consistency. Son et al. present a solution for deadline allocation using queuing networks. Research on workflow reliability focuses on system implementation issues, with various techniques proposed to enhance reliability.

Although research on WfMS QoS is lacking, significant work has been done in networking, real-time applications, and middleware. Recently, in the area of Web services, the DAML-S specification allows the semantic description of business processes, including QoS parameters. However, every process needs to have QoS metrics specified by the user.

### 2.9 FUTURE WORK

The workflow QoS model presented can be extended in two additional dimensions: maintainability and trust. Maintainability refers to the mean time necessary to repair workflow failures, and advanced mechanisms have been developed to allow automatic recovery. Luo et al. describe an exception-handling mechanism that adapts over time, using case-based reasoning to repair damaged workflows.

The trust dimension is crucial for coordinating and managing Web services. Workflow systems face several security challenges, and dedicated mechanisms are needed to increase security levels. We have implemented two security modules: one targeting ISO-recommended security services and another enabling multilevel secure (MLS) workflow systems.

The functions used to compute QoS dimensions at runtime (Table 2-6) have weighted terms. Additional research could explore the use of variable weights, allowing the workflow system to automatically adjust weights based on the number of workflow executions. Bayesian estimates could be investigated to enable these adjustments.

### 2.10 CONCLUSIONS

New trading models, such as e-commerce, bring new challenges and requirements. Many e-commerce applications involve Web services forming workflows, which represent cross-organizational business processes. The use of workflows and WfMS in a heterogeneous and distributed environment requires effective QoS management. Trading agreements include QoS specifications, and proper management of these specifications directly impacts the success of organizations and the evolution of e-commerce.

In this paper, we highlight the importance of QoS management for workflows and WfMS. Based on our experience, we present a QoS model that includes four dimensions: time, cost, reliability, and fidelity. The use of QoS increases the added value of workflow systems in e-commerce.
