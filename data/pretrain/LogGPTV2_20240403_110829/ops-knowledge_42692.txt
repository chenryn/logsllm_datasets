User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题protecting a single .exe-file for downloading with htaccess and htpasswd? I have this, and only this, in a .htaccess file inside my downloads folder:

&lt;FilesMatch "\.(exe)$"&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Downloads"
  AuthUserFile path/to/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;


Once I click the link to download a href="fileName.exe"&gt;FileName&lt;/a&gt;, I'm getting a 500 server error.

If I leave out the &lt;FilesMatch&gt;-part; The protection part is working, I guess, since I get the login box.
But once I get into the protected area, the 500 server error occurs.

What am I doing wrong here?  

My intention was to protect only a single .exe file to prevent downloaded by anyone.

Is there any easier or more correct way of doing this?

Assistant: If you want to protect a single file, why are you using FilesMatch to begin with ?

Of course, all Directory-level directives are prohibited inside htaccess files; your error log will tell you exactly what you did wrong.

Just use your httpd.conf with a straight  section.
