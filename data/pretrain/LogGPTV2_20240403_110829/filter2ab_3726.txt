### Title: The Hunt for Major League IoT-ICS Threats: A Deep Dive into the IoT Threat Landscape

**Abstract:**

The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an integral part of modern life, and with it, security threats have proliferated. Our research and threat hunts have revealed that hundreds of millions of devices have been compromised by attackers, often incorporated into large botnets or disrupted through malicious programs exploiting zero-day or one-day vulnerabilities.

To enhance detection and defensive capabilities against these IoT-Industrial Control System (ICS) threats, we have deployed hundreds of automated threat hunting engines globally. Over the past year, our systems have analyzed more than 45 terabytes of network traffic, detected over 1.1 billion attacks originating from more than 200 countries, and identified more than 400 million suspicious IP addresses, 30 million suspicious domains, and over 1 million malicious files, including Remote Access Trojans (RATs), trojans, worms, and ransomware. Notably, more than 40% of these malicious files were previously unknown to VirusTotal, indicating the rapid evolution of new threats. Additionally, we estimate that more than 1.1 million devices may have been assimilated into botnets.

In this talk, we will provide a detailed overview of how we built our automated, large-scale threat hunting system. We will also delve into the overall threat landscape and emerging trends, using six specific hunting examples from the past year. We will share the insights gained, the benefits of our findings, and our responses to these threats. Finally, we will discuss the next steps for our ongoing threat hunting project.

**Key Points:**
1. **Threat Landscape Overview:**
   - Extent of IoT-ICS threats and their impact.
   - Common attack vectors and vulnerabilities.
   
2. **Automated Threat Hunting System:**
   - Architecture and deployment of global threat hunting engines.
   - Techniques and tools used for detection and analysis.

3. **Case Studies:**
   - Six detailed examples of recent threat hunts.
   - Analysis of attack patterns and methods.
