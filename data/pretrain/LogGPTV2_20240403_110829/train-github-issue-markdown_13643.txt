Yesterday, I saw a bug in the behaviour of inputs with ngModel set. When you
have some text in the input already and you put the cursor before that text
and start typing really fast (press all buttons of your keyboard), the cursor
jumps to the end of the string. The issue also occurs in textareas making them
unusable.

Without fixing this, inputs and textareas are unusable since writing something
in the middle of the content is an important feature.
