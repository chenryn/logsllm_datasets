(2) Bootstrap from (1) to bound the probability of the event Bs,t ,
an event of no occurrence of Nakamoto blocks for a long
time.
Intuitively, if (1) holds, then one would expect that the chance
that Nakamoto blocks do not occur over a long time is low, provided
that a block being Nakaomoto is close to independent of another
block being Nakamoto if the mining times of the two blocks are far
apart. We perform the bootstrapping by exploiting this fact for the
various models under consideration.
In [PS17], the bootstrapping yields a bound exp(−Ω(√
t)) on
P(Bs,s +t). By recursively applying the bootstrapping procedure,
1−ε)) on P(Bs,s +t), for any
we are able to get a bound exp(−Ω(t
ε > 0. We apply this general analysis strategy to the three models
in the next two subsections.
4.3 Nakamoto PoW and Praos/SnowWhite PoS
Models
This subsection is dedicated to proving Theorem 4.2. We will show
that if
λh
,
λa  0 such that
P(Bs,s +t)  0. In this context, we first establish that the probability
of occurrence of a Nakamoto block is bounded away from 0.
Lemma 4.5. If
λa  0 such that the probability that the j-th
honest block is a Nakamoto block is at least p for all j.
The proof of Lemma 4.5 is given in §C.1 of the Appendix. It is
based on connecting the event of being a Nakamoto block to the
event of a random walk never returning to the starting point. An
alternative proof is presented in §C.2 of the Appendix.
We next obtain a bound on P(Bs,s +t).
Lemma 4.6. If
λa  0 there exist constants aε , Aε so that for all s, t ≥ 0,
P(Bs,s +t)  0 such that that probability the j-th honest block
is a Nakamoto block is greater than p for all j.
The proof of this result can be found in §D.2 of the Appendix.
Having established the fact that Nakamoto blocks occurs with
non-zero frequency, we can bootstrap on Lemma 4.8 to get a bound
on the probability that in a time interval [s, s + t], there are no
Nakamoto blocks, i.e. a bound on P(Bs,s +t).
Lemma 4.9. If
eλa  0 there exist constants ¯aε , ¯Aε so that for all s, t ≥ 0,
(21)
The proof of this result can be found in §D.3 of the Appendix.
Then combining Lemma 4.9 with Lemma 4.4 implies Theorem 4.3.
P(Bs,s +t) ≤ ¯Aε exp(−¯aε t
1−ε).
5 DOES NAKAMOTO REALLY ALWAYS WIN?
We have shown that the threshold for the adversary power beyond
which the private attack succeeds is in fact the tight threshold for
the security of the three models M1-PoW, M1-PS and M1-Chia.
However, security threshold is a statistical concept. Can we say that
the private attack is the worst attack in a stronger, deterministic,
sense?
Indeed, it turns out that one can, with a slight strengthening
of the private attack, in a special case: the PoW model with net-
work delay ∆ = 0. In this setting, we can indeed make a stronger
statement.
In the PoW model, any attack strategy π consists of two com-
ponents: where to place each new adversary arrival and when to
release the adversary blocks. Consider a specific attack πSZ: the
Sompolinsky and Zohar’s strategy of private attack with pre-mining
[SZ16]. This attack focuses on a block b: it builds up a private chain
with the maximum lead over the public chain when block b is
mined, and then starts a private attack from that lead. We have the
following result.
Theorem 5.1. Let τ h1 , τ h2 , . . . and τ a1 , τ a2 , . . . be a given sequence
of mining times of the honest and adversary blocks. Let b be a specific
block. (i) Suppose π violates the persistence of b with parameter k, i.e.
b leaves the longest chain after becoming k-deep. Then the πSZ attack
on b also forces b to leave the longest chain after becoming k-deep,
under the same mining times. (ii) Suppose b is an honest block and π
violates liveness for the k consecutive honest blocks starting with b,
i.e. none of the k consecutive honest blocks starting with b stay in the
longest chain indefinitely. Then the πSZ attack on b also forces these k
consecutive honest blocks to leave the longest chain indefinitely under
the same mining times.
The full proof of this theorem, together with a counter-example
in the case of ∆ > 0, can be found in §F. To demonstrate the main
ideas used in the full proof, we focus here on a special case of
where the adversary attacks the first honest block, b1, mined after
the genesis block. Note that in this special case, the Sompolinsky
and Zohar’s attack strategy πSZ against b1 is simply Nakamoto’s
private attack starting at the genesis block. In this context, we
prove that if the persistence of b1 with parameter k is violated by
an adversary following some arbitrary attack strategy π, then, it is
also violated by an adversary following the private attack under the
same sequence of mining times for the honest and adversary blocks.
The proof will be built on the observation that at any depth, there
can be at most one honest block when ∆ = 0. This observation is
a direct result of the Chain Growth Lemma in [GKL15], and is a
consequence of the fact that there is no forking among the honest
blocks when delay ∆ = 0.
Proof. Let L(.) and L∗(.) denote the lengths of the public longest
chains, denoted by C and C∗ under π and the private attack respec-
tively. Let τ1 be the mining time of block b1, and, define t > τ1 as the
first time block b disappears from C after it becomes k deep within
C, under π. Let H and A denote the number of honest and adversary
blocks mined by time t under the given sequence of mining times.
We first focus on π. Since π removes b1 from C at time t, there
is another chain building on the genesis block that is parallel to C
and at least as long as C at time t. (See top of Figure 5.) Since there
can be at most one honest block at every depth and there cannot
be any honest block deeper than L(t) (by virtue of the fact that L(t)
is the length of the public longest chain), A ≥ L(t) ≥ H. Also, since
b1 is at least k deep at time t, L(t) ≥ k. Hence, A ≥ max{H , k}.
L∗(t)  0,
as the time it takes for Dh to reach depth d after reaching depth
d −1. In other words, Xd is the difference between the times t1 > t2,
where t1 is the minimum time t such that Dh(t) = d, and, t2 is the
minimum time t such that Dh(t) = d − 1.
Let Uj be the event that the j-th honest block bj is a loner, i.e.,
Uj = {τ h
j−1 < τ h
