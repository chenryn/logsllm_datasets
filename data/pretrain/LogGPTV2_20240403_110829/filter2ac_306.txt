**Description:**
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for both user and privileged accounts. This additional layer of security significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Most embedded network devices support TACACS+ and RADIUS protocols, which can be leveraged to enforce MFA. It is also recommended to follow the vendor's best practices for hardening access control.
