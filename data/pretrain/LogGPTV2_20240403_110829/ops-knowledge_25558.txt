User: Please give some common cloud computing security threats and provide countermeasures.
Assistant: 1. Data leakage: Although cloud computing service providers have comprehensive security measures, sensitive client data may still be stolen by hackers. It is recommended to use data encryption technology and multi-factor authentication to improve data security. 2. DDOS attack: Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack refers to sending a large number of data packets to the target server, occupying its bandwidth and computing resources, so that it cannot operate normally. DDoS protection can be used to guard against such attacks. 3. Denial Attack: A denial attack occurs when a user denies that he or she has performed a particular action. Monitoring and auditing of cloud computing applications is one of the powerful means to prevent such attacks. 4. Virtualization security: Multiple virtual machines share the same physical server, so access and interaction between virtual machines must be strictly controlled. A common practice is to implement access control and traffic isolation at the virtualization level. 5. Malware: Malware can invade cloud computing resources and endanger data security. Users should install reliable security software and regularly update the antivirus software database. 6. Account hijacking: Hackers steal client users and passwords, pretend to be users to access cloud computing resources, and tamper, steal or delete data. Strict authentication and access control mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, should be implemented.
