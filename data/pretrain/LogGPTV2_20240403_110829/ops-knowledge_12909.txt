User: I'm packaging a GUI app for MacOS with Pyinstaller, using --windowed flag. Is it possible to package it so that it would show a console in addition to the GUI? When I tried to set console=True, the GUI part fails.
In other words, when I start the App from the terminal by typing "open My.App/Contents/MacOS/myapp", then I do get both GUI and console. I'd like to get similar behaviour by just double-clicking on the App without starting the terminal. Is there a way to do it?
Assistant: while you create application don't add those options

--windowed and --noconsole
