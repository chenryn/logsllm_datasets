As discussed, it is possible for Java JAR files, which are essentially ZIP-formatted archives, to include a prefixed bash script. This allows them to function as fully executable applications. Many existing tools, such as `java -jar` and `unzip`, support ZIP files with additional prefixed bytes.

Unfortunately, the Go programming language currently does not support reading such archives. This limitation causes issues for the Cloud Foundry CLI tool, which relies on this functionality.
