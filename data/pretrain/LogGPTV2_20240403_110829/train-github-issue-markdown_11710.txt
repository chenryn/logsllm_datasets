As discussed here it is possible for Java jar files (zip formatted archives)
to include a prefixed bash script that allows them to act like fully
executable applications. Many existing tools (`java -jar`, `unzip` etc)
support zip files with additional prefixed bytes.
Unfortunately `go` currently doesn't support the reading of such archives
which causes problems for the Cloud Foundry cli tool.
