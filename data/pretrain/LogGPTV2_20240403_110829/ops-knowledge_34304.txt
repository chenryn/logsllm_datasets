User: Does anyone know how to associate the py extension with the python interpreter on Mac OS X 10.5.7? I have gotten as far as selecting the application with which to associate it (/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin/python), but the python executable appears as a non-selectable grayed-out item. Any ideas?
Assistant: The file associations are done with the "Get Info".  You select your .PY file, select the File  menu; Get Info menu item.
Mid-way down the Get Info page is "Open With".
You can pick the Python Launcher.  There's a Change All.. button that changes the association for all .py files.
