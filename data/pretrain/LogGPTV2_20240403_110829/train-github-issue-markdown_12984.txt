When Deno REPL get invoked via bash in Elementary OS (which is a ubuntu based
distro), and then closed via Key binds `Ctrl + c ` or `Ctrl + d ` both work
the same way closing it successfully.  
But when one tries to close the REPL using `close()` function call, Deno
blocks **visually** the shell.
The user cannot see anymore anything that is being typed at the terminal,
until it's terminated.
I've added a GIF to illustrate:

I'm not sure if it's the intended behaviour of deno or a problem due to OS
being used:  
elementary OS 5.1.4 Hera Built on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.
