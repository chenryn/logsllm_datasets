### Bug summary
On Windows, but not on Linux, with Python 3.9. **8** installed,
key_press_events both work for the two examples from the MPL documentation:
Keypress demo
Embedding TkInter demo
The "Keypress demo" will **not** work with a clean install of Python 3.9.
**9** (i.e one not upgraded from an earlier Python 3.9.x release. Deleting a
previous install **and** obliterating the install directory is fine. Just
upgrading, or uninstalling without obliteration, are not enough.
The problem exists in Python 3.10 on Windows.
The problem is not there for the Qt5Agg backend.
### Code for reproduction
    1. Perform a clean install of Python 3.9.9 on Windows.
    2. Install matplotlib.
    3. Copy the code from the
    [Keypress demo](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/event_handling/keypress_demo.html?highlight=key_press_event) in to a file.
    4. Run it.
    5. Press some keys.
    5. Note stdout.
### Actual outcome
Stdout will be empty.
### Expected outcome
Stdout should say things like:
press a  
press a  
press a  
press a  
press a  
press a  
press b  
press c  
press d  
press e
