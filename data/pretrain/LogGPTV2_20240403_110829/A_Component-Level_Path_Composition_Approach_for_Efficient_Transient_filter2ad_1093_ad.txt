## Summary
Existing path-based techniques, while effective in reducing memory requirements for large model analysis, are limited by the need to explore a large number of paths to obtain tight bounds. This paper introduces a novel approach using path composition, which computes possible subpaths for each component and then composes these subpaths to explore multiple paths simultaneously. This eliminates redundant computation of common subpaths across multiple paths. We also demonstrate how a path-selection approach can work seamlessly with the path-composition algorithm to find important subpaths efficiently. Our approach achieved a speedup of 6.6 to 8.8 times for two benchmark models. To our knowledge, this is the first use of path composition for Markov model analysis, making it feasible to evaluate significantly larger practical systems.
