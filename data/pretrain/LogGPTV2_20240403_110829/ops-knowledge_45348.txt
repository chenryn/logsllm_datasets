User: I'm using a 32-bit Ubuntu machine. I'm trying to create a Whoosh index of a 27GB file. But my system is crashing after index size of 3GB. Is there any size constraint on Whoosh index size? If not then what can be the problem.
Assistant: Is it possible that Whoosh overflows to RAM of your computer by loading the 27Gb file?
