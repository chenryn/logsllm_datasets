appears in more than 10% of the queries were a keyword appears. We distin-
guish between 3 main types of words that appear together with keywords: media
type, pornography related words, and names. Words that fall under the category
”media type” include, for example, ”video”, ”pics” and ”stickam”, representing
three type of media ﬁles: movies, still pictures and streaming media. We note
that the term ”video” is most common amongst such queries, as can be expected
from torrents. Words that fall under the category ”pornography” include terms
such as ”sex”,”xxx”, and ”porn”. When a keyword occurs together with one of
these words in a query, the ill intent of the issuing user is clear, for example,
co-occurrences of ”lolita” and ”porn” or of ”12yo” with ”sex”. The last group
of words includes personal names, is of highest concern. This category includes
names such as ”Vicky”, ”Jenny” and ”Daphne”, issued together with keywords
”PTSC” and ”PTHC”. The most troubling aspect is when these words appear
together in queries with age indication, like ”9yo jenny”. While this may sound
as a naive query, a quick search of this term on the web leads to tens of pe-
dophile forums discussions with a clear description of the movie contents as well
as other sources that include the illicit content. We thus deduce that this method
can be used also outside the BitTorrent network to track and discover pedophile
contents.
Extending The Dictionary. An important contribution is detecting new
terms that relate to child sex abuse, which is a hard task in an anonymous
database. For this end, we analyze separately queries from each city, and de-
ﬁne a busy period as a sequence of queries with no gaps longer than a given
threshold. In large cities with many users the busy period is an aggregation of
many users and may be quite long. We are looking for cities with sparse accesses
to Mininova, where the probability that two user sessions will fall into the same
busy period is negligible.
We analyze the busy periods length in cities with an average of 500 queries a
day or less and found that in 98.5% of the cases the length is no longer than ﬁve
minutes and the number of queries is no more than ten. We thus assume that
these busy periods are due to a single user activity and deﬁne a single user
busy period (SUBP) as a busy period up to ﬁve minutes long and with up
to ten queries . This is in line with Alexa [1] ﬁnding that the average site visit
time was 4.3 minutes. For further analysis we used only cities that contain only
distinct SUBPs, at least 10 SUBPs and that registered at least one pedophile
query. This resulted in 692 cities.
We ﬁnd the SUBPs where pedophile terms were used in queries and create a
list of potential new keywords. This list has initially about two thousand words.
We screen out of these words numbers, conjunctions and terms that are highly
ranked in the global queries list (such as ”Harry Potter”). This process was also
accompanied by a manual inspection, in order to avoid ﬁltering required terms.
This leaves us with 140 words. We classify those to four groups: 51 General
sex related words, 29 names of potential victims, 54 pedophile keywords, and
7 words that may refer to either general pornography or child sex abuse. The
54 new words include 19 words that have either a spelling error or a diﬀerent
112

spelling than an existing keyword in the database, such as ”lolyta”, 18 familiar
terms that are written a bit diﬀerently, e.g., 10yr or kingspass, and 17 completely
new terms. The new terms were checked using Urban Dictionary [16] and Google
websearch, without entering any site with an illicit material. The list of ignored
phrases is updated in accordance. This thus extended the dictionary by 115%.
Four of the words in the extended dictionary are also ranked within a new top
12 pedophile query terms, with 842 to 3317 queries each.
One issue in extending the dictionary is the deﬁnition of child sex abuse
terms. As deﬁnitions diﬀer between countries, it is unclear whether terms such
as ”teensex” should be added or not. The heuristic discovers six such new terms,
that relate to teens pornography.
Frequency. The frequency of pedophile queries is relatively high, approximately
0.04% of all queries to the database. The queries are distributed across all hours
of the day, with least queries being sent at 6am and most queries sent at 1am
(user’s local time). The pedophile queries frequency graph generally follows the
global queries graph, with minor deviations, mainly caused by a slightly higher
rate of pedophile queries during night hours and early morning. The high rate of
pedophile queries is also interesting as the site scarcely contains child sex abuse
torrents, yet we did not observe a decline in queries rate over time, as may be
expected when pedophiles ﬁnd out the contents of the site.
3.3 Downloads Analysis
Distinct Pedophile Downloads. We detect in the Mininova database only 5
ﬁles (out of over a million) that include in their ﬁlename keywords taken from
our dictionary and are not of a legal nature. These ﬁles are also manually checked
and veriﬁed to be potential illicit material and not innocent ones4. We note that
some ﬁles, such as torrents called ”PTHC” are often used to target their leechers
and spread viruses, however our focus here is the leechers and not the seeders.
The distinct 5 ﬁles contain ﬁve of the words included in our dictionary, and
they are downloaded 1432 times within the dataset timeframe.
Correlation Between Downloads And Queries. Tracking down pedophile
activity in the Mininova dataset is a hard task, both in identifying child sex
abuse material and processing the large database. A diﬀerent challenge stems
from the fact that while the dataset provides a torrent name, the meta data
connected to this torrent, such as a description of the ﬁle and users comments,
are not visible to us. As a result, it is diﬃcult to correlate between queries and
downloads, since the connection may reside in the hidden data. We use three
parameters to overcome this obstacle: time, city and repetition pattern. We say
that the query and download correlate if they both originate from the same
city and the download is seen shortly after the query. If a suspected ﬁlename
includes one of the dictionary terms, or if the set of downloads resulting from the
restrictions on time and city include only a single entry, then the task is simple.

however, this is not the common case. We thus say that a ﬁle is included in a
set of suspected pedophile ﬁles if for multiple pedophile queries it is included in
the resulting downloads set. Using our heuristic, we ﬁnd a ratio of 1:30 between
queries and downloads, while using a set of over 90K pedophile queries.
The ﬁrst observation is that 7.2% of the queries result in no matched down-
load. Another indication of success of the heuristic is that it detects downloads
of the pedophile torrents with known keywords (as described in Section 3.3). We
note in this group of downloads the reoccurrence of keywords with kids names,
such as a torrent called ”pthc 9yo jenny”. It also detected pedophile torrents
that contain in their ﬁlenames words with sexual connotation. We note that the
majority of these ﬁles is pictures and not other types of multimedia. We last
detect a group of ﬁles with innocent names, that can easily be tracked back
to pornographic material. An attempt to discover child pornography ﬁles with
innocent names has failed so far.
We take some of the ﬁles with pedophile related keywords in their ﬁlenames
and further investigate them. while most considered torrents include distinctive
keywords, some torrents known to include child pornography may be the result
of an occasional pornography search (for example, a nudist family movie whose
content was veriﬁed). Figure 2 shows the number of downloads of four of these
torrents as a result of a pedophilic query, compared to their overall number of
downloads. The ﬁrst three ﬁles, marked P1 through P3, have distinct pedophilic
words in their names, such as PTHC and Raygold. File V4 is pedophilic in the
wide sense, meaning its name includes pornographic but not pedophilic keywords
in it, but its content is known to include a video of nude children. The selected
ﬁles are downloaded only within the duration that we check the database, mean-
ing their ﬁrst and last downloads are in the timeframe our dataset was collected.
V4 is the only exception, as its ﬁrst download may have occurred before we
started logging.
We take these downloads and cross them back to the queries generating from
the same location in the time period before the ﬁle was downloaded. We ﬁnd
that many of the downloaded ﬁles are as a result of direct access to the page.
For P3 only two queries were submitted that contain a pedophilic or a sex
related word. For other ﬁles, we see that most of the downloads are also the
result of direct access, either because no query was submitted from the origin
city before the download time or because no pedophilic or pornographic related
query was issued. For all four torrents, 23% to 67% of the downloads had no
prior query, 15% to 34% of the downloads followed a query with a word from the
torrent’s name and 5% to 14% of the downloads can be related to a pedophilic
or pornographic keyword in a previous query (except for P3). As in large cities,
such as Chicago, Paris or London, there are tens of queries every minute, we can
not track the query directly to its source despite ﬁltering out innocent queries.
Figure 3 shows for the same four ﬁles the download time distribution. Each
sub-ﬁgure shows for one of the ﬁles the number of downloads every hour since
the ﬁle was ﬁrst downloaded. As the behavior diﬀers signiﬁcantly between ﬁles,
the axis values are diﬀerent. For ﬁle P1 and P3, the downloads peak in the ﬁrst
114

hour that the ﬁle is distributed, and decline afterwards (P3 is downloaded over
2 hours only). File P2 and V4 are downloaded over a long period of time, at a
relatively constant low rate, with the gap during this time period caused by a
gap in the data. interestingly, File V4 peaks after 3-4 days since the measurement
begins, as opposed to the previous cases.
Geographic Aspects. The geographic distribution of illicit downloads is spread
around the world, in all continents. We take the four ﬁles discussed in the previ-
ous section and further investigate their download pattern. Following their trend
in time, the downloads are spread across four continents from the time of the
ﬁrst download to the last.
Another interesting result checks the time diﬀerence between downloads from
the same city. While the lifetime of P3 is not long enough to examine this, in
P1 the time gap between two downloads from the same city is less then one day,
for cities with more than a couple of downloads. In torrents P2 and V4, on the
other hand, the gap between two downloads is often over a week and even over a
month. The density of downloads from the same city is lower as well. We assume
that this may be as the contents of P1 and P3 may be of ”high quality”, while
P2 and V4 may be bogus or of lower interest, hence this result.
3.4 Behavior Analysis
We use the small cities heuristic described in 3.2 to explore the behavior of
pedophile users in the Mininova database. We note that small cities behavior
may be diﬀerent than a global view, but we believe that due to the large number
of cities included in this analysis, it has a value.
The average number of queries in a standard visit to Mininova is measured (in
the set of small cities) to be 2.6. In comparison, a visit which includes a pedophile
Detecting Pedophile Activity in BitTorrent Networks

term in it has on the average only 1.5 queries. The average gap between queries
in such a visit is 32 seconds.
4 Conclusion
In this paper we presented an analysis of pedophilic activity in Mininova, a portal
used by the BitTorrent network. We discussed how child pornography is spread
through multimedia ﬁles and how the ﬁles can be detected on the BitTorrent
network. The paper focused on the characteristics of the molesters looking for
illicit material, as they manifest in their web activity, by time and content. We
also suggest a way to expand the list of known pedophile keywords, and succeed
to more than double our initial list. A repetitive run of this heuristic on recent
peer-to-peer databases can assist law enforcement teams to detect pedophiles
more eﬃciently.
