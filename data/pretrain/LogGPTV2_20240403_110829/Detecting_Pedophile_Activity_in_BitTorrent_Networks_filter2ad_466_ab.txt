### Detecting Pedophile Activity in BitTorrent Networks

#### 1. Introduction
In this study, we analyze the presence of pedophilic activity within the Mininova database, a portal for the BitTorrent network. We focus on identifying keywords and patterns that indicate the search and download of child pornography. Our analysis includes the frequency of such queries, the geographic distribution of these activities, and the behavior of users involved.

#### 2. Keyword Analysis
We found that no single word appears in more than 10% of the queries. Keywords are categorized into three main types: media type, pornography-related words, and personal names.

- **Media Type**: Words like "video," "pics," and "stickam" represent different types of media files (movies, still pictures, and streaming media). The term "video" is the most common.
- **Pornography-Related Words**: Terms such as "sex," "xxx," and "porn" are frequently used. When these terms appear with specific keywords (e.g., "lolita" or "12yo"), the intent is clear.
- **Personal Names**: Names like "Vicky," "Jenny," and "Daphne" are often used with keywords like "PTSC" and "PTHC." Queries like "9yo jenny" are particularly concerning, as they lead to numerous discussions and illicit content on pedophile forums.

#### 3. Extending the Dictionary
To detect new terms related to child sex abuse, we analyzed queries from different cities. We defined a "busy period" as a sequence of queries with no gaps longer than a given threshold. In cities with fewer than 500 queries per day, 98.5% of busy periods are no longer than five minutes and contain no more than ten queries. This aligns with the average site visit time of 4.3 minutes, as reported by Alexa [1].

We identified Single User Busy Periods (SUBPs) and created a list of potential new keywords. After filtering out numbers, conjunctions, and highly ranked global queries, we were left with 140 words. These were classified into four groups:
- **General Sex-Related Words**: 51 terms
- **Names of Potential Victims**: 29 names
- **Pedophile Keywords**: 54 terms, including 19 with spelling errors, 18 familiar terms written differently, and 17 completely new terms
- **Ambiguous Terms**: 7 words that could refer to either general pornography or child sex abuse

The extended dictionary increased by 115%, with four new terms ranking among the top 12 pedophile query terms.

#### 4. Frequency and Distribution
Pedophile queries account for approximately 0.04% of all queries. These queries are distributed across all hours, with the least at 6 AM and the most at 1 AM (user's local time). The frequency graph generally follows the global queries graph, with a slightly higher rate during night and early morning hours.

#### 5. Downloads Analysis
We detected only 5 files (out of over a million) containing keywords from our dictionary and verified to be potential illicit material. These files were downloaded 1432 times within the dataset timeframe.

**Correlation Between Downloads and Queries**:
- **Time and City**: We correlated queries and downloads if they originated from the same city and the download occurred shortly after the query.
- **Repetition Pattern**: If a suspected filename included a dictionary term or if the set of downloads from the same city and time included only one entry, the correlation was straightforward.
- **Heuristic Results**: Using our heuristic, we found a ratio of 1:30 between queries and downloads, with 7.2% of queries resulting in no matched download.

**File Download Patterns**:
- **P1 and P3**: Downloads peaked in the first hour and declined afterward.
- **P2 and V4**: Downloads occurred over a long period at a relatively constant low rate, with V4 peaking after 3-4 days.

**Geographic Aspects**:
- Illicit downloads were spread across all continents.
- For P1, the time gap between two downloads from the same city was less than one day.
- For P2 and V4, the gap was often over a week or even a month.

#### 6. Behavior Analysis
Using the small cities heuristic, we found that the average number of queries in a standard visit to Mininova was 2.6, while visits with pedophile terms had an average of 1.5 queries. The average gap between queries in such visits was 32 seconds.

#### 7. Conclusion
This paper presents an analysis of pedophilic activity in the Mininova database, focusing on the characteristics of users searching for illicit material. We suggest a method to expand the list of known pedophile keywords and demonstrate its effectiveness. Regularly applying this heuristic to recent peer-to-peer databases can assist law enforcement in detecting and combating pedophilia more efficiently.
