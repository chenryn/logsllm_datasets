### Reflection and Detection

When an application invokes methods via reflection, the detection approach described earlier becomes ineffective, as it does not identify any suspicious API calls. Additionally, automated analysis struggles to detect if an application implements a "reflection VM." A potential solution is for verification services to reject applications that heavily use reflection.

### System Protection

#### Google's Security Mechanism
In Android 4.2, Google introduced a security mechanism that contacts Google servers whenever an application is installed via sideloading. The system computes a SHA-256 hash of the APK and sends it to Google along with other application information to check if it is known to be malicious. If so, the user is warned, and the installation is halted. This mechanism effectively implements a blacklist approach, but it has a significant drawback: it only identifies known malware. Moreover, this protection is only active if Google Play is installed on the device and a network connection is available. If the device is offline, the system allows the user to install the application without warning. Furthermore, the protection is only invoked during application installations, making it vulnerable to many of the techniques described in Section III-A.

#### Apple's Mandatory Code Signing
Apple employs a technique called Mandatory Code Signing in iOS. This enforces at the memory-page level that all executed code is signed. Developers sign their applications with certificates issued by Apple. From the moment the system is powered on, it ensures that only signed code is executed, including the boot loader and the operating system itself (the Secure Boot Chain). The chain starts from a key hard-coded into read-only memory on the chip of any iOS device. While this approach provides a high level of security against code injection and execution of unapproved code, it requires deep modifications to both the operating system and hardware. Given the extensive changes required, it is unlikely that Android will adopt a similar mechanism in the near future. Additionally, Apple's approach ties users to a single application verification entity, meaning that if Apple does not approve an application, it cannot run on an iOS device unless the device is jailbroken. Our approach addresses this issue by allowing users to choose which verification services to trust.

#### SELinux on Android
Smalley and Craig ported SELinux, a well-known security kernel extension, to Android. SELinux can enforce policies on the behavior of running applications, limiting their interaction with the environment to necessary activities. However, without tailoring policies specifically to the application, only general rules can be established. Thus, SELinux on Android does not restrain an application that loads and executes additional code, as long as it operates within its permissions. Alternatively, application developers would need to write specific policies, but there is a risk that these policies may not be strict enough to prevent malicious activity. Additionally, defining policies in SELinuxâ€™s extensive policy language can slow down application development and be difficult to enforce.

#### Dalvik Bytecode Rewriting
Another widely researched technique for protecting Android systems is Dalvik bytecode rewriting. The basic idea is to detect portions of an application that call security-sensitive APIs and redirect these calls to a monitor service that implements fine-grained access control. This modification can occur offline using static analysis. However, external code loaded at runtime poses a problem. If rewriting takes place before the application is installed, code loaded at runtime evades the rewriting process and remains unrestricted. To counter this, bytecode rewriters would need to run on the Android device, constantly monitoring for attempts to access sensitive APIs that have not been rewritten. This is computationally expensive and undesirable on mobile devices, where system resources are limited and battery life is crucial.

### Vulnerability Analysis

#### SSL Usage in Android Applications
Fahl et al. conducted a study on the use of SSL in Android applications, showing that a large portion of applications do not make appropriate use of SSL's security benefits. Many popular applications from Google Play are vulnerable to various attacks due to incorrect implementation of security mechanisms. They conclude that one part of the problem is the lack of easy-to-use security features for developers. Their results highlight the necessity of security mechanisms enforced by the operating system for all applications, independent of individual developers, as implemented in our approach.

#### Runtime Code Downloading
In 2010, Jon Oberheide demonstrated how to download arbitrary additional code in Android applications at runtime. He used this technique to distribute root exploits to devices running his application.

#### Insecure Update Mechanisms
Bellissimo et al. demonstrated in 2006 that many update mechanisms for applications and operating systems are insecure. Their attacks are similar to those we apply against Android applications, but targeted at desktop software.

#### Static Analysis for Vulnerability Detection
We are not the first to use static analysis to detect vulnerabilities in Android applications. Au et al. use it to find a mapping between Android APIs and required permissions for different versions of Android. Lu et al. employ static analysis to detect applications that expose components to other applications in an insecure way, leading to the risk of component hijacking. Zhou and Jiang find similar vulnerabilities, detecting applications that expose access to content providers in a way that allows other applications to read or modify protected content. Chin et al. analyze the general communication interface provided by an application to detect possibilities of information leakage. Grace et al. detect capability leaks in preinstalled Android applications, i.e., permissions requested by system applications but not properly protected against unauthorized use by third-party applications.

The previously presented approaches focus on detecting specific vulnerabilities in applications. They could be used by the verification services we propose to detect vulnerabilities in benign applications.

#### Code-Loading Techniques
In 2012, Grace et al. used static analysis to detect some of the code-loading techniques discussed in this paper. Specifically, they searched for uses of native code and DexClassLoader in Android applications to identify malicious applications in stores. However, their work does not cover all categories of code-loading techniques discussed in Section III-A, nor do the authors propose a comprehensive protection scheme. Another publication by Grace et al. leverages static analysis to find uses of DexClassLoader in advertisement frameworks but also falls short of detecting other code-loading techniques or offering a protection mechanism.

### Conclusion
Our analysis shows that the ability of Android applications to load code at runtime causes significant security issues. We demonstrated that a surprisingly large portion of existing applications is vulnerable to code injection due to improper use of different loading techniques. This is exacerbated by the fact that vulnerabilities are often found in frameworks used by many applications. Additionally, we showed that attackers could use dynamic code-loading to avoid detection by offline application analysis engines, particularly the Google Bouncer. To automatically detect such vulnerabilities or malicious functionalities, we implemented a static analysis tool and demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting interesting samples.

Furthermore, we presented a modification to the Android system that prevents exploits resulting from vulnerable loading techniques by ensuring that all loaded code is approved by an application verification service. Based on this mechanism, we proposed a general architecture of different verification services that users can choose from. We showed that our protection system can prevent all attacks presented in this paper. We hope that the proposed modification will be included in a future release of Android to be distributed to as many devices as possible.
