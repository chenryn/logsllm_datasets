I have a header component with a logo image and on chrome visiting other pages
does not force the logo image to reload. But on safari, every time I visit a
new page all the images including the logo image reload.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
For safari to behave the same as chrome.
## Current Behavior
Safari will reload the image instead of caching it.  
I also get these two errors in the console. Only in safari and not chrome.
    [Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) (_error.js.map, line 0)
    [Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) (_app.js.map, line 0)
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Set up simple next hello world  
Create a index.js and about.js  
Create a component named header.js with links to index and about and an image  
Include header component in index and about pages  
Start dev server  
Compare between chrome and safari
