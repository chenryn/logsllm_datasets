When trying to select multiple lines that all have a particular string with
cmd+D and move them up or down within the document, Atom will select the lines
properly, but when trying to move them it de-selects the additional lines and
only moves the originally selected line. If you select multiple lines with the
mouse or with Cmd+L it works just fine, and It still deletes multiple lines
properly when selected with cmd+D - it's just moving lines that fails. I've
taken a screen capture of the bug to illustrate what happens, which is
viewable here: https://slack-files.com/T024TD89T-F075EUW8K-1e3ac80187
