### How I Broke the Build

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. **Navigate to the Working Directory:**
   ```sh
   % pwd
   /home/rog/src/go/src/local/gobug
   ```

2. **List the Current Directory:**
   ```sh
   % ls
   ```

3. **Create `foo.go`:**
   ```sh
   % cat > foo.go
   package foo
   var X = 0
   ^D
   ```

4. **Create `bar.go`:**
   ```sh
   % cat > bar.go
   package foo
   var Y = 0
   ^D
   ```

5. **Create `foo_test.go`:**
   ```sh
   % cat > foo_test.go
   package foo_test
   import (
       "testing"
       foo "local/gobug"
   )
   func TestX(t *testing.T) {
       _ = foo.X
   }
   ^D
   ```

6. **Run the Tests:**
   ```sh
   % go test
   PASS
   ok      local/gobug 0.011s
   ```

7. **Install the Package:**
   ```sh
   % go install
   ```

8. **Move `foo.go` to Another Location:**
   ```sh
   % rm foo.go  # As it happens, I actually moved it elsewhere.
   ```

9. **Build the Package:**
   ```sh
   % go build
   ```

10. **Reinstall the Package:**
    ```sh
    % go install
    ```

11. **Run the Tests Again:**
    ```sh
    % go test
    PASS
    ok      local/gobug 0.011s
    ```

12. **Everything appears to be working, so I pushed the changes to the trunk, which broke the build.**

13. **Update the Modification Time of All `.go` Files:**
    ```sh
    % touch *.go
    ```

14. **Run the Tests Once More:**
    ```sh
    % go test
    # local/gobug_test
    ./foo_test.go:7: undefined: foo.X
    FAIL    local/gobug [build failed]
    ```

#### Analysis
The build was broken because the `foo.go` file, which defined the variable `X`, was removed. The `go` tool did not detect this change during the subsequent build and test steps, leading to the failure when the tests were run again.

#### Suggestion
It might be beneficial for the `go` tool to consider the modification time of the directory in addition to the source files when determining whether to rebuild. This could help catch such issues earlier.
