The message `valid_resources` should instead be a list of "primary resources",
their shortcuts, and an optional description returned by the `Factory` (and
probably generated by the same code that is used to resolve resource names, so
as not to duplicate it). Or it should be generated by p.HandledResources
(although that doesn't have shortcut info).
Ideal structure:
  * get invokes p.HandledResources and iterates
  * it retrieves shortcut (if any) from the RESTMapper or factory
  * it retrieves a short description from the description we generate for swagger (first sentence?)
As is, it is easy for someone to miss.
