Google, transfer money”) 10 times each at the same tone and pace
as the output of our text to speech module. Our results showed that
39 out of 40 (97.5%) commands passed our audio similarity filter as
valid commands. We investigated why the last command did not
pass and concluded that there was audio clipping happening on
our recorded commands (i.e., the first part of “O” in “OK” was not
caught by the microphone).
Since our control test demonstrated reliability, we expanded our
experiment to include a real world office scenario with white noise
generators in the background. We recorded the same commands as
before but this time the commands were spoken at the same tone
and pace as a regular conversation. We set up two microphones
three meters apart and recorded the commands. In this case, each
microphone played the role of either the user’s mobile device or the
voice operated home assistant. We used two different configuration
for testing; audio originating at an equidistant location from both
microphones and audio originating closer to one microphone than
the other. In total, we obtained 80 different samples.
Of the 80 samples, all passed the first speech digest comparison,
were correctly transcribed by the STT module and then converted
to new audio samples by our TTS module. After removing silence
and resampling the audio as explained in Section 6.2, 62/80 (77.5%)
passed the final speech digest comparison. In Figure 9, we show the
BER rate of each second from the 80 audio samples we gathered.
A closer inspection showed that many of the seconds with a BER

Two Microphone Authentication
8.2 Improving Accuracy
The ability to provide a tighter uncertainty cone would further re-
duce false negatives. Better hardware in the home assistant would
help make this possible. For instance, our Respeaker 4 Microphone
Array is representative of less provisioned home assistants. The
Google Home with only 2 microphones is the most similar to our de-
vice. However, better equipped home assistants such as the Amazon
Alexa and Apple Homepod with 7 and 6 microphones respectively
are also available. Having additional microphones would allow
us to further limit this cone-however, we believe that our results
represent the average hardware available on the market
8.3 Application Considerations
Sensitive Commands. 2MA systems authenticate any command
that is heard by the home assistant before it is executed. However,
not all commands made are sensitive or require an authentication
process. Commands such as “How’s the weather today?” or “What
time is it?” should be readily available to be queried by anyone
without having to go through the authentication steps set by 2MA.
However, banking transaction are more sensitive and would benefit
from the extra security. By setting an access control scheme or a user
defined blacklist and whitelist for commands, 2MA systems could
be deployed without removing the convenience of voice operated
devices.
Smart TV Authentication. Voice commands can be used to re-
motely control Smart TVs. Unfortunately, these commands can also
come from various, potentially malicious, sources. Although our
2MA embodiment focused on authenticating voice commands for
home assistants, we can further expand our command authentica-
tion to include smart TVs. By simply replacing the home assistant’s
microphones for the microphones found in the smart TV, a 2MA
embodiment could then colocote the user’s mobile device with the
voice command’s origin.
Purchase Authorization. The use of a voice interface for online
shopping is becoming increasingly popular. From Amazon [6] to
Apple [7] and, more recently, Google Home’s shopping integration
with Walmart [16]. While convenient, the voice interface’s lack of
command authorization enables an adversary to make purchases
without the consent of the owner. A possible solution to this lack
of authorization can be to deploy a 2MA system. For any command
to successfully be executed, 2MA would require the user’s mobile
device (and therefore, the user) to be in the same vicinity as the
voice interface. In this case, the colocation of the user and the
command would implicitly authorize any online purchase made.
However, if the user’s mobile device is not near the home assistant,
then the command would be treated as malicious and automatically
rejected.
8.4 Change of Ownership
IoT devices are becoming more prevalent in today’s world. For
example, hotel rooms are now equipped with devices (e.g., home
assistants, window blinds, thermostat) that allow occupants to seam-
lessly “connect” to the room by logging in to their personal cloud
profile. One problem that arises from the ubiquity of these devices is
the possible exposure of personal information when the ownership
ASIA CCS ’18, June 4–8, 2018, Incheon, Republic of Korea
is transferred from one user to the other (e.g., the next guest that
uses the same hotel room). From the perspective of the original
user, once they have checked out of the room, the IoT device can be
considered dead. Accordingly, the IoT device should remove all of
their credentials from the device. However, this may not the case.
Once a new guest checks-in to the room, they will have access to
these same device. If the devices never removed the previous user’s
credentials, the new user will have access to them. This exposure
could potentially allow the new user to make commands on behalf
of the previous one.
Similarly, built in IoT devices could change ownership in real
estate transactions. Much like hotel rooms, houses are either built
with IoT devices permanently fixed to the structure or the owner
has to augment their home throughout their stay. When the house
is eventually sold to a new owner, many of these devices will likely
change ownership as well. Unfortunately, these devices have no
way in verifying that the ownership of the home has changed. If
the original owner did not actively remove their credentials, then
the new tenant could give commands to the IoT devices with the
previously stored credentials.
In both scenarios described above, the underlying issue comes
from devices being unaware of the change of ownership. A possible
solution to this problem is to implement a 2MA system that gener-
ates mobile tokens to temporarily authenticate sensitive commands
for a set amount of time. For example, if a new tenant were to
make a sensitive command after the mobile token expires, then the
2MA system would prevent the command from being placed. Such
system would have a similar concept as continuous authentica-
tion [33, 43]. However, unlike continuous authentication, the goal
of this system would not be to completely stop the new tenant from
using these built-in devices. Rather, the goal is to prevent the new
tenant from making sensitive commands before setting up their
own home cloud environment. Developing and parameterizing a
system as described is an interesting area that we leave for future
work.
8.5 2MA Systems With Additional Hardware
Our 2MA embodiment was made to be easily deployable. We made
concessions to avoid adding extra hardware other than the user’s
mobile device and the home assistant itself. However, many IoT
device (e.g., smart security cameras, smart baby monitors, and blue-
tooth speakers) contain microphones that could be potentially used
as additional inputs. A 2MA system could leverage these additional
microphones with DOA, or alternative localization technique, to
find the exact location of a voice command. In a space containing
additional microphones, a 2MA system could construct separate
uncertainty cones that could then be used to pinpoint the internal
location of the voice command. Rather than only showing direc-
tionality of the command, we could determine a small region from
which the command originated. Having a tighter bound on the
location of the command would serve to increase the security of a
2MA system.
It is our hope that readers see 2MA as a generic framework, and
build applications appropriate for specific contexts (as we have
done) going forward.

9 CONCLUSION
Voice commands dramatically simplify many user interfaces, and
are critical to the operation of many IoT devices. Unfortunately,
such commands are only protected by the assumption that only
authorized users are capable of speaking to these devices. As has
repeatedly been demonstrated recently, this is no longer a realistic
assumption [3, 9]. In this work, we propose Two Microphone Au-
thentication (2MA). 2MA systems take advantage of the presence of
multiple microphones being present in an ecosystem to localize and
authenticate the source of a command. We demonstrate that such a
construction works using independent devices (e.g., a mobile phone
and a home assistant) in both benign and malicious settings, and in
so doing dramatically increase the effort required by an attacker
to inject such commands successfully. To this end, we show that
the increased deployment of microphones in many settings can be
used to improve authentication.
