ABSTRACT
We present Piezo-Acoustic Backscatter (PAB), the first technology
that enables backscatter networking in underwater environments.
PAB relies on the piezoelectric effect to enable underwater commu-
nication and sensing at near-zero power. Its architecture is inspired
by radio backscatter which works well in air but cannot work well
underwater due to the exponential attenuation of radio signals in
water.
PAB nodes harvest energy from underwater acoustic signals using
piezoelectric interfaces and communicate by modulating the piezo-
electric impedance. Our design introduces innovations that enable
concurrent multiple access through circuit-based frequency tuning
of backscatter modulation and a MAC that exploits the properties of
PAB nodes to deliver higher network throughput and decode network
collisions.
We built a prototype of our design using custom-designed, me-
chanically fabricated transducers and an end-to-end battery-free
hardware implementation. We tested our nodes in large experimental
water tanks at the MIT Sea Grant. Our results demonstrate single-
link throughputs up to 3 kbps and power-up ranges up to 10 m.
Finally, we show how our design can be used to measure acidity,
temperature, and pressure. Looking ahead, the system can be used
in ocean exploration, marine life sensing, and underwater climate
change monitoring.

INTRODUCTION
1
Backscatter is the lowest power wireless communication technol-
ogy, which has led to its widespread adoption for ultra-low power
networking [1, 43, 48, 56, 87]. Backscatter sensors can wirelessly
communicate at near-zero power by simply reflecting radio signals
in the environment. In this paper, we investigate the ability to take
backscatter networking to underwater environments. In particular,
since wireless communication is the largest source of energy con-
sumption for many underwater sensors [61, 81], transitioning to
backscatter technology would eliminate the need for batteries which
increase size and cost and require frequent replacement [41]. Battery-
free underwater sensors would enable us to sense ocean conditions
(such as acidity, temperature, and bacteria content) over extended
periods of time and understand how they correlate with climate
change [44]. Scientists may attach these sensors to marine animals
and use them to understand migration and habitat patterns [77]. Such
sensors may even be used in space missions to search for life in the
recently discovered subsurface oceans of Saturn’s moon, Titan [52].
More generally, underwater battery-free sensors can be leveraged in
many long-term ocean applications such as naval deployments, oil
spill monitoring, and scientific exploration.
Unfortunately, existing backscatter networks are intrinsically in-
capable of operating underwater. This is because they rely on radio
signals, which die exponentially in water [26, 38], making them
undesirable for underwater communication and power harvesting.
In contrast, underwater communication typically relies on acoustic
signals, which can travel over long distances underwater [67, 68]. In-
deed, that is why submarines rely on acoustic signals (e.g., SONAR)
rather than radio signals for communication and sensing [79].
To enable underwater backscatter networking, we exploit the
piezoelectric effect.1 This effect refers to the ability of certain ma-
terials to generate electrical energy in response to an applied me-
chanical stress [64]. Since acoustic signals travel as pressure waves,
they would induce a strain (deformation) on a piezoelectric material,
causing it to transform the pressure wave into a voltage; hence, this
effect has been used in designing certain kinds of microphones [27].
More importantly, the piezoelectric effect is reversible, meaning
that electrical signals applied on the electrodes of a piezoelectric
device can be used to generate acoustic signals. It is this reversibility
that makes piezoelectricity an enabler for underwater backscatter
communication.
We introduce Piezo-Acoustic Backscatter (PAB), a system that en-
ables underwater networking at near-zero power. We explain PAB’s
high-level operation through an analogy to radio backscatter in Fig. 1.
In radio frequency (RF) backscatter, a transmitting antenna sends a
signal on the downlink, and an RF backscatter node harvests energy
from this signal and communicates by modulating its reflection. On
1Note that the term “backscatter” is often used in the underwater literature to refer to
SONAR-based imaging of objects by reflection [15, 22] rather than for communication
or networking, which is the goal of this paper.

To overcome this challenge and enable multiple PAB sensors to
transmit concurrently, our idea is to shift the piezoelectric resonance
frequency itself across the different sensors. If different sensors have
slightly different resonance frequencies, then they would occupy dif-
ferent bands of the acoustic frequency spectrum, naturally leading to
FDMA. Hence, if different projectors transmit acoustic signals at dif-
ferent frequencies, each would activate a different sensor operating
at the corresponding resonance frequency, thus enabling concurrent
multiple access. The hydrophone receives all the reflected signals
and applies software-based filters in order to isolate and decode the
colliding backscatter reflections.
To realize this idea, we introduce the concept of recto-piezos.
Recto-piezos are acoustic backscatter nodes whose resonance fre-
quency can be tuned through programmable circuit matching. The
design of recto-piezos is inspired by a concept from RF-based en-
ergy harvesting called rectennas [46]. Rectennas can optimize their
energy harvesting efficiency by matching the impedance of the rec-
tifier (energy harvester) to the antenna. This impedance matching
results in a resonance mode, at which rectennas are known to opti-
mally harvest energy. While recto-piezos are inspired by this idea,
they instead employ it for tuning their resonance frequency. This
matching-based frequency tuning allows us to ensure that different
sensors have different resonance frequencies, and enable multiple
concurrent backscatter transmissions, thus improving the network
throughput.
We built a prototype of PAB’s design and tested it in large exper-
imental water tanks at the MIT Sea Grant. Each battery-free node
consists of a mechanically fabricated piezoelectric resonator, potted
in polyurethane for acoustic matching, and a custom-made PCB that
incorporates the recto-piezo, the energy harvesting unit, a micro-
controller that implements the backscatter logic, and a general and
extensible peripheral interface that can be integrated with different
sensors.
Our results demonstrate that PAB sensors achieve communication
throughputs up to 3 kbps and power-up ranges up to 10 m. We also
demonstrate how our recto-piezo design enables tuning the reso-
nance frequency and shifting it to an adjacent channel. This enables
doubling the network throughput through concurrent transmissions
and collision decoding.
To show the potential of our design, we implement proof-of-
concepts for three sensing tasks. PAB nodes are integrated with
sensing interfaces that can measure acidity (pH), temperature, and
pressure. Such sensors may be powered by the node’s harvested
energy and the microcontroller samples their analog output or com-
municates with their digital interface using one of its peripherals.
Our evaluation demonstrates the ability to correctly sense these mea-
surement conditions, enabling long-term ocean condition monitoring.
It is worth noting that while these applications can work well with
modest throughputs, PAB’s throughput could support more demand-
ing applications such as recording sound or low-quality images of
marine animals and plants.
Contributions: PAB is the first underwater backscatter communica-
tion system. It introduces a new backscatter technology and sensor
architecture that exploits the piezoelectric effect for backscatter net-
working. It also introduces recto-piezo, a programmable resonance
design that enables multiple PAB sensors to operate concurrently.

Figure 1—Analogy between RF and Piezo-Acoustic Backscatter. (a) shows how
radio backscatter can communicate bits of zero and one by controlling the antenna
impedance switch. (b) shows how PAB system communicates bits of zero and one by
controlling the piezoelectric impedance switch. Note that in the absorptive states, the
sensor can harvest energy.
the other hand, a PAB system consists of an acoustic projector (trans-
mitter), a hydrophone (receiver), and a battery-free sensor. When
the projector transmits acoustic signals underwater, a PAB sensor
harvests energy from these signals and communicates by modulating
their reflections. In particular, it can transmit a ‘0’ bit by absorb-
ing the incoming energy, and a ‘1’ bit by reflecting the impinging
acoustic signal. It can switch between the reflective and absorptive
states by modulating the voltage across the piezoelectric interface,
which in turn determines its vibration amplitude (i.e., reflection).
The hydrophone receives the acoustic signals, senses changes in the
amplitude due to reflection, and decodes these changes to recover
the transmitted messages.
Interestingly, PAB operates a piezoelectric material as a reflector
by preventing it from deforming (i.e., nulling the strain). Intuitively,
if the material cannot deform, it is unable to absorb the incoming
acoustic signal and must reflect it entirely. To do so, the node can
simply activate a switch that connects the device’s electrodes as
shown in Fig. 1(b). Such switching requires near-zero power and can
be done entirely using the harvested energy, enabling PAB sensors
to be battery-free. In §3, we describe this process in detail and the
underlying physics of piezo-acoustic backscatter.
A fundamental challenge facing PAB networks, however, is that
piezoelectric materials are typically designed to operate at a specific
resonant frequency [8].2 While operating at resonance improves
their sensitivity and range of operation, it also limits their bandwidth.
This prevents different links from concurrently communicating over
multiple channels as in standard WiFi or cellular networks. Said dif-
ferently, it precludes the adoption of medium access control (MAC)
protocols like frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), where
concurrent links occupy different parts of the frequency spectrum.
2This is typically denoted by a high quality factor ‘Q’ (quality factor) [76], which is the
ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth.

The paper also contributes a prototype implementation and evalua-
tion of a battery-free platform for ocean sensing and communication.
Our current design still exhibits limitations in its modest through-
put and range. These limitations are primarily imposed by the down-
link signal and the desire to keep the implementation battery-free
through energy harvesting. In principle, one could achieve higher
throughputs and ranges by adapting battery-assisted backscatter im-
plementations from RF designs [59], which would enable deep-sea
deployments and exploration, while still inheriting PAB’s benefits
of ultra-low power backscatter communication. The design and im-
plementation of such hybrid systems is outside the scope of this
paper and left for future work. More generally, we hope that PAB’s
approach for underwater networking would follow a similar trend in
throughput and range improvements witnessed by radio backscatter
in recent years.
2 BACKGROUND
The piezoelectric effect was discovered in 1880 by the Curie broth-
ers [49]. They observed that certain types of crystals generate an
electric charge when they undergo a mechanical strain (deformation).
The following year, they demonstrated that this process is reversible,
and an electric signal applied on piezoelectric crystals induces a
strain. Since its discovery, this phenomenon has been widely used in
various applications including Quartz clocks, buzzers, inkjet printers,
and X-ray shutters [13].
Our work directly builds on two main areas of piezoelectric re-
search in the context of underwater environments: energy harvesting
and acoustic transducers. In particular, since the piezoelectric ef-
