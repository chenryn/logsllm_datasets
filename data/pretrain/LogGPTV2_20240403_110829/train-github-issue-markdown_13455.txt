After modifying the value of the `indices` attribute of a `csr_matrix`,
several operations on the matrix produce segfaults. However, other sparse
matrix types (`lil_matrix` and `coo_matrix`) do not. Therefore, I suspect this
is because CSR matrix compresses the row indices.
I have not come across any legitimate use case for modifying `indices`
directly. Although I have not dug into the source code, perhaps the easiest
fix would be to make `indices` read-only from outside the `_cs_matrix` class.
I would be happy to open a PR if needed.
#### Reproducing code example:
    from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
    import numpy as np
    a = csr_matrix(np.arange(16).reshape((4, 4)))
    b = csr_matrix(np.eye(4))
    a.indices = [0] # This should not be allowed
    # Each of these lines run individually produce segfaults 
    # print(a.toarray()) 
    # print(np.sum(a))
    # print(a @ b)
Note that this is not an exhaustive list of operations. There are likely other
operations which segfault as well.
#### Error message:
This is the backtrace for the first line that segfaults (`print(a.toarray())`)
