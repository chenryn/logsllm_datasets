## Abstract
We introduce a novel online monitoring method to differentiate between attacks and normal activity in SIP-based Voice over IP (VoIP) environments. Our approach demonstrates high efficiency even with limited training data. The solution involves monitoring 38 features in VoIP flows and employing Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification. We validate our method through extensive offline experiments using real-world traces from a major VoIP provider and locally generated attack data. Results indicate high accuracy in detecting SPIT and flooding attacks, suggesting promising performance for online deployment.

## 1. Introduction
The VoIP ecosystem faces a wide array of security threats. One such threat is SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony), which is the VoIP equivalent of email spam. However, SPIT is not the only concern. Software vulnerabilities in IP phones and servers can lead to remote attacks, which were uncommon in the traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) environment, characterized by mutual trust among a few peers. The use of IP for voice communication also exposes these systems to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where resource exhaustion can target SIP proxies and back-to-back user agents, critical components of VoIP infrastructure. Other threats include VoIP bots, eavesdropping, and Vishing (a form of phishing using VoIP).

Securing VoIP infrastructures is a significant challenge for both operational and research communities, as security was not a primary focus in the early stages of VoIP development. Specific VoIP security solutions are now essential, as ongoing research and standardization efforts aim to address the issues of securing and monitoring VoIP networks.

Our work contributes to these efforts by proposing a new monitoring approach for VoIP environments. Our system uses SVMs for efficient classification, continuously monitoring 38 features in signaling time slices. A threshold-based alarm generator is integrated on top of the classification engine. We demonstrate that the system is both efficient and accurate, and we analyze the impact of various features on its performance.

In this paper, we start with a brief overview of VoIP security, focusing on flooding attacks and SPIT. We then provide a functional description of our monitoring solution and define the 38 features used for classification (Section 3). Section 4 offers a short mathematical background on the SVM learning model. In Section 5, we present offline trace inspections and describe the dataset. Section 6 evaluates the performance of our approach in detecting different types of attacks. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and Section 8 concludes the paper and outlines future work.

## 2. Threat Model

### 2.1 Flooding Attacks
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on VoIP networks often target signaling plane elements, such as proxies and gateways, with the goal of disrupting service. These attacks can be categorized based on the request URI and the type of traffic they generate:

- **UDP Flooding:** Sending a large number of random UDP packets to congest network bandwidth.
- **INVITE Flooding with a Valid SIP URI:** Overloading a phone or server by sending a high rate of calls.
- **INVITE Flooding with a Non-existent SIP URI:** Sending calls to invalid addresses, causing the proxy/server to respond with error messages and exhaust resources.
- **INVITE Flooding with an Invalid IP Domain Address:** Calling a user with a rogue IP address, leading to multiple failed connections.
- **INVITE Flooding with an Invalid Domain Name:** Sending calls with a false domain name, causing the target to issue multiple DNS requests and exhaust memory.
- **INVITE Flooding with an Invalid SIP URI in Another Domain:** Targeting multiple domains simultaneously, causing cascading failures.
- **INVITE/REGISTER Flooding with Authentication Enabled:** Interrupting the authentication process, leading to resource exhaustion.

### 2.2 Social Threats and SPIT
Social threats in VoIP include unsolicited communications like SPIT, which are similar to email spam but delivered via voice calls. These calls can be telemarketing or Vishing (VoIP phishing) attempts, where attackers try to trick users into revealing personal information or dialing expensive numbers. SPIT and Vishing are challenging to detect because they are technically valid transactions. Techniques used to filter email spam, such as text filtering, are not directly applicable to VoIP, as the content is not available until the call is answered.

## 3. Our Monitoring Solution
To address these threats, we propose a monitoring scheme that tracks SIP messages in a queue of predefined size. Once the queue is full, a vector of statistics/features is computed and used for classification. The system is designed to be modular, allowing for the integration of different classification and artificial intelligence techniques. The key features we monitor include:

- **General Statistics:** Number of requests, responses, SDP bodies, and inter-arrival times.
- **Call-Id Based Statistics:** Number of Call-Ids, duration, and number of messages per Call-Id.
- **Distribution of Final States:** States of dialogs, including NOTACALL, CALLSET, CANCELED, REJECTED, INCALL, COMPLETED, and RESIDUE.
- **Distribution of SIP Requests:** Types of SIP requests, such as INVITE, REGISTER, BYE, etc.
- **Distribution of SIP Responses:** Types of SIP responses, including Informational, Success, Redirection, Client Error, Server Error, and Global Error.

These features help in characterizing the traffic and identifying anomalous patterns. The system's real-time performance is ensured by maintaining a decision-making pace that is faster than the message arrival rate.

## 4. Mathematical Background of SVM
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful tool for classification tasks. They work by finding the hyperplane that maximally separates different classes in the feature space. SVMs can handle both linear and non-linear classification problems through the use of kernel functions. In our system, we use SVMs to classify the feature vectors extracted from SIP traffic, enabling us to distinguish between normal and malicious activities.

## 5. Offline Trace Inspections
We validate our approach using a combination of real-world traces from a major VoIP provider and synthetic attack data. The dataset includes a variety of attack scenarios and normal traffic, allowing us to evaluate the system's performance in a realistic setting.

## 6. Performance Evaluation
Our experiments show that the system achieves high accuracy in detecting SPIT and flooding attacks. The results are promising for online deployment, as the system maintains real-time performance while providing reliable detection.

## 7. Related Work
We review existing approaches to VoIP security and monitoring, highlighting the unique aspects of our solution. Our method stands out due to its efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability to different types of attacks.

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, our proposed monitoring system effectively distinguishes between attacks and normal activity in SIP-based VoIP environments. The use of SVMs and a comprehensive set of features enables accurate and efficient classification. Future work will focus on further improving the system's performance and expanding its capabilities to address additional security threats.
