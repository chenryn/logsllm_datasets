period.
multiple probes can cause the aggregated delay increase.
Indeed, by computing probes’ median RTT in 30-minute
time-bins, we filter out bins that are congested for less than
15 minutes. Combining probe signals with the median also
implies that the majority of the probes should experience
delay increase to be visible at the AS level.
2.3 Detecting persistent congestion
As illustrated above, and more broadly in our survey (§3),
persistent congestion is visible on a daily basis. We leverage
this observation to systematically identify persistent last-mile
congestion in our large collection of traceroutes.
We employ basic signal processing techniques to decom-
pose aggregated delay signals in frequency components and
extract the daily patterns. Namely, we convert the aggre-
gated delay signals to the frequency domain using the Welch
method. This method splits the delay signals in overlapping
segments and computes the periodogram (i.e. power mea-
surements vs. frequency bins) of each segment using Fourier
transform. Then all periodograms are averaged to obtain a
final periodogram that is less affected by noise in the original
signals.
The Welch method enables us to identify the prominent
frequency component of signals by finding the frequency bin
with the highest power in the periodogram. Then we check if
the frequency bin corresponds to daily fluctuations, and we
derive from the corresponding power in the periodogram the
average peak-to-peak amplitude of these fluctuations. These

method and aggregated queuing delays of Fig.1. The
y-axis is normalized to read directly average peak-to-
peak amplitude. See legend in Fig.1.
two markers (frequency and amplitude) allow us to classify
aggregated delay signals into four categories:
∙ Severe: prominent daily pattern and amplitude over 3ms.
∙ Mild: prominent daily pattern and amplitude over 1ms.
∙ Low: prominent daily pattern and amplitude over 0.5ms.
∙ None: no prominent daily pattern or daily pattern
amplitude below 0.5ms.
The 0.5ms threshold value is set to focus mainly on the
most congested networks. The 1ms and 3ms threshold values
are set such that the size of classes Severe, Mild, Low, are
well balanced in our experiments (see Fig.4).
Going back to our example with ISP DE and ISP US,
Figure 2 depicts the periodograms derived from the signals
shown in Figure 1. Here the periodograms are displayed
such that the y-axis represent the peak-to-peak amplitude.
For ISP DE (left plot) the spectrum is mostly flat, meaning
that the signal is mainly composed of noise. However, the
daily frequency bin (x=1/24) is clearly dominant for ISP US
(right plot). The average daily amplitude is usually estimated
around 0.4ms except on April 2020 where it goes up to 1.19ms.
Thus we classify ISP US as mildly congested on April 2020
and as not congested during the other measurement periods.
3 PERSISTENT LAST-MILE
CONGESTION IN ATLAS
Now we extend our last-mile congestion analysis to all ASes
hosting at least three Atlas probes. Here we include v1 and v2
probes for a better coverage and obtain classification results
for a total of 646 ASes in 2018-2019.

tends to appear in large eyeball networks (i.e. top 1000 ASes

periods are similar and hence not displayed.
COVID-19. In April 2020 we observe an increase of last-
mile congested ASes that we attribute to the impact of
lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of
ASes hosting congested probes increased by 55% (45 to 70
ASes) from September 2019 to April 2020. As expected, large
eyeball networks are the most impacted ones (Fig. 4). The
largest reported network being ISP US with an average daily
amplitude of 1.19ms as shown in Figure 1.
Notice that this work is, however, only looking at last-
mile congestion, the increase of traffic during lockdowns may
create congestion at other locations. For example Italy has
reportedly been experiencing significant end-to-end delay
increases [5, 15] but this was not noticed in our results on
April 2020.
Geographical distribution. Using the country code provided
with the APNIC ranks, we also look into the geographical dis-
tribution of congested ASNs before COVID-19. Out of the 98
monitored countries, 53 have at least one reported ASN, and
only 23 have at least one ASN reported as severely congested.
Japan contains the highest number of Severe reports (18%
over the two years), followed by U.S.A. (8%). Out of the top
10 monitored Japanese ASes (in terms of APNIC rankings),
5 are reported at least once in 2018 and 2019, including 3
that are constantly reported. In contrast to the low number
of congested ASes found across the Atlas platform, Japan
has a relatively high number of congested ASes. Policy mak-
ers [18] and network operators [19] have previously pointed
out the overwhelming use of Japan’s legacy infrastructure
and mention it as source of congestion. As this serves as a
good example to illustrate persistent last-mile congestion and

all monitored signals (left plot), and distribution of
peak-to-peak amplitude for prominent daily compo-
nents (right plot).
3.1 A small number of congested ASes
On average about 90% of the monitored ASes are classified
as None, meaning that they exhibit no significant diurnal
pattern. The number of reported ASes (i.e. not classified
as None) is quite stable over time with an average of 47
ASes per measurement period. We observe little churn over
the two years, 36 ASes are reported for at least half of the
measurement periods.
In the previous section, we assume that persistent con-
gestion is commonly seen on a daily basis. We check this
hypothesis by identifying the main frequency component in
each AS using the Welch method. Figure 3 (left plot) reveals
that the majority of the ASes exhibits a daily fluctuation
(x=1/24), and other ASes are uniformly distributed across
the whole spectrum. Figure 3, right plot, displays the ampli-
tude corresponding to identified daily fluctuations. Around
83% of the ASes have a daily amplitude lower than 0.5ms
thus barely noticeable, then about 7% are between 0.5ms
and 1ms, another 6% are between 1ms and 3ms, and the rest
(4%) are over 3ms. Using these values for our classification
lets us focus mainly on the distribution tail, that is the top
congested networks.
3.2 Congestion in eyeball networks
To get a sense of the number of Internet users impacted by
the identified congestion, we classified our results with the
help of the APNIC eyeball population estimates [2]. Figure 4

surrounding circumstances, in the next section we present a
brief summary of Japan’s legacy infrastructure and provide
detailed analysis for Japan’s top three eyeball networks.
4 LAST-MILE CONGESTION IN
TOKYO
Japan is one of the top ranking fiber-to-the-home (FTTH)
countries, with 70% household penetration [14] as of 2018,
and holds a competitive telecommunication market. This situ-
ation was fostered by Japanese government forcing the former
state monopoly to grant unbundled access to other ISPs and
maintain a nation-wide fiber network, hereafter referred as
the legacy network [21]. The legacy network accounts for
about 70% of FTTH access in Japan, with customers usually
reaching their ISP via PPPoE. PPPoE was an enabler for
the competitive ISP market when introduced in 2000, but
has been gradually ossified because carrier-specific PPPoE
equipment is too expensive to upgrade for low-profit broad-
band services, also requiring cumbersome negotiations among
the carrier, ISPs, and government. Although comprehensive
measurement is lacking, legacy’s PPPoE equipment has been
considered as source of congestion [19, 23].
Accordingly, we investigate the relation between observed
persistent last-mile congestion and legacy’s PPPoE usage.
Our investigation starts with the following hypothesis: net-
works relying on the legacy network via PPPoE are more
prone to congestion. We check this hypothesis by looking
at delays from networks relying mostly on the legacy net-
work, ISP A and ISP B, and one network with its own fiber
network, ISP C. These are the three major ISPs in Japan.
Because the number of Atlas probes is limited with a
potential bias towards tech-savvy users, last-mile latency
results are cross referenced with CDN log data collected in
Tokyo in order to assess the presence of congestion, and
validate our approach with much larger (about 150k unique
IPs) and unbiased samples. For a fair comparison between
traceroute and CDN data, we select only Atlas probes in the
Greater Tokyo Area (i.e. Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba, Saitama)
which gives a total of 21 probes in the three selected ISPs.
The last-mile latency for these ASes is computed exactly as
presented in §2 but selecting only probes located in Tokyo.
The CDN and traceroute datasets span from September 19th
until the 26th, 2019.
4.1 Last-mile delays
Figure 5 shows the aggregated last-mile delays computed
for probes in Tokyo. The three networks are performing
with similar queuing delays outside of peak hours. During
peak hours, however, ISP A and ISP B exhibit consistent
delay increases whereas ISP C keeps stable. For ISP C we
do observe maximum delays during peak hours (depicted by
markers in Fig.5) but by an order of magnitude lower than
the two other networks.

4.2 Throughput measurements
To validate our results and estimate the impact of observed
congestion on traffic, we estimate average throughputs from
a large commercial CDN access logs collected in Tokyo. Since
the studied ASes provide both broadband and mobile services,
we filter out all entries corresponding to mobile prefixes as
advertised on their website (Appendix A). Then we select
only requests for objects greater than 3MB and marked as
cache-hit. This allows us to account for TCP dynamics [10]
and artifacts caused by CDN functioning. As with the delay
measurement, we measure throughput per IP and compute
ASN aggregates by computing the median value in 15-minute
time-bins.

First, our inferences are made from vantage points that may
not be representative of the AS they belong to, especially
when the number of Atlas probes is low. The presented
delay results are mostly conveying Atlas’s view on last-mile
congestion and thus are also prone to Atlas’ deployment bias.
Estimating the bias of Atlas is however beyond the scope of
this work.
Second, ISPs may use different access technologies thus
have mixed results, our approach is not accounting for these
discrepancies and reports only aggregated results using me-
dian values.
Finally, by monitoring median last-mile queuing delay our
inferences are drawn from the majority of the probes. The
other probes may not see any congestion. We are not ac-
counting for the variability between probes, however using
frequency analysis we ensure that congested probes are ob-
served daily thus we report only ASes with probes that are
consistently congested over time.
