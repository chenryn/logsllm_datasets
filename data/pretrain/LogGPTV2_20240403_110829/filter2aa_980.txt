#### Overview
This presentation will cover methods to determine if you are a victim of spying, including:
- Video surveillance
- Tailing
- Audio eavesdropping
- Devices embedded in your computer, tablet, or smartphone

#### Why You Should Care
- **Government Overreach:** The erosion of constitutional rights is well-documented.
- **Local Governments:** Local authorities may also engage in surveillance.
- **Competitors:** Business rivals may use espionage to gain an advantage.
- **Stalkers and Hostile Individuals:** People with personal vendettas can also spy on you.

#### Video Surveillance
##### Common Flaw in Night Vision Cameras
- **Flaw Detection:** All night vision cameras share a common flaw that can be detected using any digital camera.
- **Other IR Detection Methods:**
  - **Free Method:** Use an Android tablet or smartphone.
  - **Inexpensive Method:** Utilize a BeagleBone-based system.
  - **Moderately Expensive Method:** Detect signals in licensed bands using an Linear Technologies LTC5582 RMS RF power detector. Measure the output on a voltmeter or BeagleBone. Bandpass filters can help isolate specific frequency bands.

#### Physical Surveillance
##### Tailing
- **Common Vehicles Used:**
  - **Non-Government Spies:** Bland-colored Honda or Toyota sedans, bland-colored SUVs, or vehicles commonly seen in the area.
  - **Government Spies:** Black SUVs, Crown Victorias.
- **General Techniques:**
  - Follow distance varies from about two cars behind to a block.
  - A bumper beeper can extend the follow distance to 0.5 to 10.0 miles.
  - A tail is generally considered blown if the subject has three suspicious impressions.

##### Single Car Tailing
- Closer than multi-car tails.
- More likely to follow traffic laws.
- May use a bumper beeper to help relocate the subject if lost.

##### Multi-car Tailing
- Most cars are behind the subject.
- Some cars may be on parallel streets, especially in urban areas.
- Tailing vehicles may change relative positions.
- Vehicles might occasionally appear to go a different direction only to rejoin later.

##### Combating Tailing
- **Passive Techniques:**
  - Check around your car for trackers.
  - Watch for vehicles that seem to be behind you for long distances.
  - Watch for vehicles that go away and then come back.
- **Detect Electronic Devices:**
  - Use the previously described RF detection system without any filters.
  - Scan the AM radio band on your car radio before you go. Many homemade or privately available trackers operate in this frequency band. If you hear nothing but a strong tone, it is probably a tracker on your car.
- **Active Techniques:**
  - Drag a few traffic lights.
  - Take unusual routes.
  - Drive through residential neighborhoods.
  - Take a few alleys or deserted side streets.
  - Occasionally park for no reason.

##### Stakeout Vehicles
- Same vehicles used in tailing may be used.
- Additional vehicles might include SUVs, commercial vans, and pickup trucks with toppers.

##### Combating Stationary Surveillance
- **Passive Techniques:**
  - Look for people in parked vehicles.
  - Construction/utility workers who are around too long or appear to be doing nothing.
  - Commercial vans parked for extended periods.
  - Anyone with a view of all your exits.
- **Active Techniques:**
  - Get out your binoculars and spy back.
  - Run outside and jump in your car, then run back inside and see if anyone seems to notice.
  - Drive around the block and see if anyone followed you.

#### Audio Bugging
##### Detecting Active Bugs
- **Free Method:** An analog AM/FM radio might detect some bugs.
- **Inexpensive Method:** USB TV Tuner Software Defined Radio (SDR) can detect signals in the 50 MHz to 2 GHz range.
- **Moderately Expensive Method:** Broadband amplifier connected to a TV antenna.
- **Expensive Method:** Purchase a commercial bug detector for around $500.

##### Detecting Passive Bugs
- **Exciting the Bug:**
  - **Free Method:** Blast it with 2.4 GHz from an Alfa device.
  - **Inexpensive Method:** Noisy broadband transmitter attached to a TV antenna.
- **Detection:** The same as for active bugs, but you must try to excite the bug with RF in the correct band.

#### Bugs in Your Computing Devices
- **Installation Methods:**
  - Intercepting shipments.
  - "Service" professionals.
  - Spies in your local IT staff.
  - Disgruntled colleagues.
- **Detecting Bugs:**
  - **Free Method:** Visual inspection. Bugging devices can be installed externally. Examples include the Dalek desktop defender and TARDIS.
  - **Check Connections:** Every device connected to your computer, especially USB and network devices.
- **Internal Bugs:**
  - Open the case and look for obvious signs.
  - Pictures of NSA devices have been leaked.
  - **Inexpensive Method:** Current leaks. Bugs need current to run. Turned-off devices shouldn't draw any power.
  - **Modified Universal Laptop Power Supply:** Can be used to detect current leakage. For laptops or phones, remove the battery and measure current with the device "off." Current flow indicates a possible bug. For tablets, fully charge the battery and measure the current flow. Small current might indicate an issue with the charging circuit or battery. If the current peaks when you speak or move in view of the camera, there may be a bug.

##### Desktop Computer
- **Physical Inspection:** Best method.
- **Current Leakage Detection:** Use a Kill o Watt or similar device. Many computer power supplies leak current, so this is not conclusive. A desktop bug might only work when the computer is on.

##### Passive Bugs
- Excite as described for passive audio bugs.
- Use the same techniques as described above to detect excited bugs.
- This method won't detect all passive bugs, such as expensive NSA bugs.

#### Summary
- **Choose Your Level of Paranoia:** Even if you aren't paranoid, you can still detect many spying activities at no cost.
- **Truly Paranoid:** Can still test without financial ruin.
