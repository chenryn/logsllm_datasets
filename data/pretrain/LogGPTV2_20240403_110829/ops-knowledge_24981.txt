To change your default Python version to Python 2.7 using MacPorts on macOS Lion 10.7, you should use the `port select --set` command. The error you encountered, "Error: global does not accept --set," indicates that the `--set` option is being used incorrectly.

Hereâ€™s the correct command and an explanation of its components:

```bash
sudo port select --set python python27
```

- `port`: This is the main command for interacting with MacPorts.
- `select`: This is the action that allows you to choose a specific version of a software package.
- `--set`: This option is used to set the selected version.
- `python`: This specifies the group (or category) of the software you want to select. In this case, it is the Python interpreter.
- `python27`: This is the specific version of Python you want to set as the default.

So, the full command `sudo port select --set python python27` will set Python 2.7 as your default Python interpreter.

If you still encounter issues, ensure that `python27` is installed via MacPorts. You can check this by running:

```bash
port installed | grep python27
```

If `python27` is not installed, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo port install python27
```

After installation, run the `sudo port select --set python python27` command again to set Python 2.7 as the default.
