User: I am trying to change my default python to python27, I executed sudo port --set python27 but ended up with following error on my Mac Lion 10.7 Error: global does not accept --set. I was trying to see if MacPorts have deprecated the --set command and has introduced a new command instead. But I was unable to find anything related to that on their news website.
Assistant: -set is still there. The issue you have that you are missing a couple of arguments to the command.
It should be sudo port select --set python python27 The port command takes an action and the one here is select. port select --set then takes as first argument the group it is select for in this case python.
