A Survey and Examination of the Adequacy of  
the Laws Related to Cyber Warfare 
DONDI S. WEST* 
This paper argues that the current rules of war can address the emerging issues raised by cyber 
warfare. The author begins by giving a survey of the laws that have the biggest impact on cyber 
warfare.  Next, the author discusses several popular issues that may have unnecessarily 
intensified the cyber warfare debate.  The author then asserts the following five reasons why the 
U.S. should not enter into an international treaty for cyber warfare: (1) combatant commanders 
already have proper guidelines for conducting cyber warfare;  (2) fields of law are seldom 
demarcated by technology;  (3) an unintended consequence of a cyber warfare law is that it may 
pose an undue limitation on a primarily non-lethal strategic deterrence; (4) our adversaries are 
unlikely to comply; and (5)  the rate of technology growth will outpace the ability for an 
international cyber regime to produce responsive policy, while the flexibility allotted by the UN 
Charter  and laws of war are able to absorb technological advances. The author concludes that 
the current UN Charter and Laws of War should continue to govern cyber warfare and that 
creating an international treaty or law for cyber warfare would do more harm than good and 
seriously cripple our ability to conduct war. 
I. Introduction 
Immediately upon taking office, and in the midst of the worst economic downturn since 
the Great Depression, President Barack Obama ordered a 60-day “clean-slate” study to review 
the plans, programs, and activities related to cyber security (“the 60-day Study”).1  Although 
many people did not expect President Obama to enter the White House with cyber security as a

main concern, an investigation of recent events shows why securing cyberspace is a major 
National Security priority of the Obama Administration. 
During the Russia-Georgia conflict in August 2008, a multi-faceted cyber attack was 
conducted against the Georgian infrastructure and key government websites.2  The attack 
modalities included defacing websites; web-based psychological operations; a fierce propaganda 
campaign; and distributed denial-of-service attacks.3  The public witnessed one of the most vivid 
accounts of Cyber Warfare, when CNN‟s Wolf Blitzer attempted to interview Georgian 
President Mikhail Saakashvili by phone on his live news program during conflict.  CNN couldn‟t 
reach President Saakashvili initially.4  President Saakashvili blamed the difficulty connecting on 
a “cyber attack” against Georgia‟s telephone system.  In addition to the situation described by 
President Saakashvili, attackers defaced the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs‟ website with 
an image of Adolf Hitler next to an image of President Saakashvilli.5 
Most recently, in April 2009, the Wall Street Journal (“WSJ”) reported that cyber spies 
penetrated the US electrical grid.6  Days later, on the front page, the WSJ reported that cyber 
hackers had breached the Pentagon‟s $300 billion Joint Strike Fighter project.7  On July 4, 2009, 
cyber attackers disabled a number of US government websites, including the Treasury 
Department, Secret Service, Federal Trade Commission and Transportation Department sites.8 
These incidents exemplify the scope of the risks posed by cyber security, and shows why 
the Obama Administration now consider securing cyberspace a vital National Security priority.

In May of 2009, the White House released the results of its 60-day Study.  The results included 
“near-term” and “mid-term” action plans, which together outlined 24 actions that should be taken 
to assist in putting the U.S. on course to secure cyberspace.9  One of the near-term action items 
makes a recommendation to “[c]onvene appropriate interagency mechanisms to conduct 
interagency-cleared legal analyses of priority cybersecurity-related issues identified during the 
policy-development process and formulate coherent unified policy guidance that clarifies roles, 
responsibilities, and the application of agency authorities for cybersecurity-related activities 
across the Federal government.”10  Although this action item recommends that legal analysis be 
conducted concerning “cybersecurity-related issues,” it is rather broad and vague.  In particular, 
the government is not required to address the unique legal issues that arise as a result of the U.S.

particular, the action plan included the following steps:  
1. Appoint a cybersecurity policy official responsible for coordinating the Nation‟s cybersecurity policies 
and activities; establish a strong NSC directorate, under the direction of the cybersecurity policy 
official dual-hatted to the NSC and the NEC, to coordinate interagency development of cybersecurity-
related strategy and policy. 
2. Prepare for the President‟s approval an updated national strategy to secure the information and 
communications infrastructure. This strategy should include continued evaluation of CNCI activities 
and, where appropriate, build on its successes. 
3. Designate cybersecurity as one of the President‟s key management priorities and establish performance 
metrics. 
4. Designate a privacy and civil liberties official to the NSC cybersecurity directorate. 
5. Convene appropriate interagency mechanisms to conduct interagency-cleared legal analyses of priority 
cybersecurity-related issues identified during the policy-development process and formulate coherent 
unified policy guidance that clarifies roles, responsibilities, and the application of agency authorities 
for cybersecurity-related activities across the Federal government. 
6. Initiate a national public awareness and education campaign to promote cybersecurity. 
7. Develop U.S. Government positions for an international cybersecurity policy framework and 
strengthen our international partnerships to create initiatives that address the full range of activities, 
policies, and opportunities associated with cybersecurity. 
8. Prepare a cybersecurity incident response plan; initiate a dialog to enhance public-private partnerships 
with an eye toward streamlining, aligning, and providing resources to optimize their contribution and 
engagement. 
9. In collaboration with other EOP entities, develop a framework for research and development strategies 
that focus on game-changing technologies that have the potential to enhance the security, reliability, 
resilience, and trustworthiness of digital infrastructure; provide the research community access to event 
data to facilitate developing tools, testing theories, and identifying workable solutions. 
10. Build a cybersecurity-based identity management vision and strategy that addresses privacy and civil 
liberties interests, leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies for the Nation.

conducting and defending against cyber warfare.  In fact, legal scholars are involved in an 
intense debate on whether there should be a new set of laws written to govern cyber warfare.11  
Some legal scholars even advocate that there should be an international treaty for cyber warfare. 
This article first surveys the current legal frameworks governing cyber warfare.12  Next, it 
comments on several exaggerated hot-button issues.13  It then argues that the traditional laws of 
war give combatant commanders the tools they need to conduct warfare in the information age.14  
Creating an international treaty for cyber warfare would do more harm than good. 
II. Introduction to Computer Network Operations and the Actors Involved  
Analysts often discuss the concepts of cyber warfare and cyber security in overly-broad 
terms.   For example, if a cyber actor gains unauthorized access to a computer network and 
copies data, then a commentator may refer to this act as a “cyber attack.”15  But, if the cyber 
actor was merely snooping and didn‟t alter the performance or content of the network, then a 
cyber attack hasn‟t occurred sense military doctrine divides cyber acts into three separate 
domains collectively called Computer Network Operations.16  According to Joint Publication 3-
13, the full-spectrum of Computer Network Operations (“CNO”) encompasses three domains: 
Computer Network Attack (“CNA”), Computer Network Exploitation (“CNE”), and Computer 
Network Defense (“CND”). 17  Within the military domain, CNO is considered one of five core 
capabilities under Information Operations (“IO”).18  The other capabilities include Psychological

(“OPSEC”) and Electronic Warfare22 (“EW”).  Warfighters integrate these five IO capabilities to 
influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while 
protecting our own.23  The Joint Publication goes on to define each of the three domains of CNO.  
CNA includes actions taken via computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy the 
information within enemy computers and computer networks.24  CND includes actions taken via 
computer networks to protect, monitor, analyze, detect and respond to network attacks, 
intrusions, disruptions or other unauthorized actions that would compromise or cripple defense 
information systems and networks.25  CNE includes enabling actions and intelligence collection 
via computer networks that exploit data gathered from target or enemy information systems or 
networks.26   Analyst and commentators tend to use the term “Cyber” in an overly broad manner, 
appending the term to virtually anything that is computer related.  It is therefore necessary to 
understand Cyber within the context of which of the three CNO domains are being referenced.  
An example of CND would be deploying an intrusion detection system to protect a government 
network.  An example of CNE would include gaining access to an adversary network‟s email 
server and analyzing email content for intelligence purposes.27  Michael N. Schmitt, Stockton 
Chair at the Naval War College, gives an excellent description of CNA by describing several 
CNA scenarios:

27 The “networking snooping” example given at the beginning of this paragraph is also an example of CNE. 
Hypothetical examples of CNA, some realistic, others stretching credulity, abound in 
literature. Consider just a few. 
(1) Trains are misrouted and crash after the computer systems controlling them 
are maliciously manipulated. 
(2) An information blockade is mounted to limit the flow of electronic 
information into or out of a target state. 
(3) Banking computer systems are broken into and their databases corrupted. 
(4) An automated municipal traffic control system is compromised, thereby 
causing massive traffic jams and frustrating responses by emergency fire, 
medical, and law enforcement vehicles. 
(5) Intrusion into the computer system controlling water distribution allows the 
intruder to rapidly open and close valves. This creates a hammer effect that 
eventually causes widespread pipe ruptures. 
(6) A logic bomb set to activate upon initiation of mass casualty operations is 
imbedded in a municipal emergency response computer system.28  
Although CND and CNE are unavoidable issues when it comes to Cyber Warfare, this article is 
primarily concerned with the laws related to CNA.  Thus, the term Cyber Warfare, for the 
purposes of this article, is being referenced in the context of conducting or responding to a CNA 
on government computer systems or a nation‟s critical infrastructure.  Governments use the term 
“critical infrastructure” to describe assets that are essential for the functioning of a society and 
economy.29  For example, homeland security analysts consider the U.S. electrical grid to be 
critical infrastructure because a significant outage is capable of causing widespread damage to 
health, communication, economic, transportation, and other systems.30  Thus, in addition to 
attacks on government systems, a cyber attack on a nation‟s critical infrastructure can also be 
considered a CNA.31
