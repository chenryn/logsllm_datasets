in ping followed by a hostname or IP address to see what will respond to the ICMP
echo request. The following screenshot shows a ping of www.google.com:

Chapter 2
If you get any responses back, you will know that your host is alive. If you get any
timeouts, your ICMP request is being blocked, or no destination host has received
your request.
The problem with the ping command is that it only allows you to use ICMP to
check on one host at a time. The fping command will allow you ping multiple
hosts with a single command. It will also let you read a file with multiple
hostnames or IP addresses and send them using ICMP echo requests packets.
To use the fping command to run an ICMP sweep on a network, issue the
following command:
fping-asg network/host bits
fping -asg 10.0.1.0/24
Although the a flag will return the results via IP address of live hosts only, the s flag
displays statistics about the scan, the g flag sets fping in quite mode, which means it
does show the user the status of each scan, only the summary when it has completed.
The Nmap provides similar results as the fping command.
DNS Reconnaissance techniques
Most high-value targets have a DNS name associated to an application. DNS
names make it easier for users to access a particular service and add a layer of
professionalism to their system. For example, if you want to access Google for
information, you could open a browser and type in 74.125.227.101 or type www.
google.com.

Reconnaissance
DNS information about a particular target can be extremely useful to a Penetration
Tester. DNS allows a Penetration Tester to map out systems and subdomains. Older
DNS attacks transfer a zone file from an authoritative DNS, allowing the tester to
examine the full contents of the zone file to identify potential targets. Unfortunately,
most DNS servers today do not allow unauthenticated zone transfers. However, all
is not lost! DNS by its very nature is a service that responds to queries; therefore,
an attacker could use a word list query containing hundreds of names with a DNS
server. This attack vector is an extremely time consuming task; however, most
aspects can be automated.
Dig (domain information groper) is one the most popular and widely used DNS
Reconnaissance tools. It queries DNS servers. To use Dig, open a command prompt
and type dig and hostname, where hostname represents the target domain. Dig
will use your operating systems default DNS settings to query the hostname.
You can also configure Dig to query custom DNS servers by adding @ to the
command. The example in the following screenshot illustrates using Dig on
www.cloudcentrics.com.
[ 54 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
The -t option in Dig will delegate a DNS zone to use the authoritative name
servers. We type dig -t ns cloudcentrics.com in the example in the
following screenshot:
We see from the results we have two authoritative DNS servers for the domain
www.cloudcentrics.com; they are ns3681.hostgator.com and ns3682.
hostgator.com.
Congratulations, you have just found the authoritative DNS server for your
target DNS.
DNS target identification
Now that you have found the authoritative DNS servers for a domain, you might
want to see what hosts have entries on that domain. For example, the domain
drchaos.com may have several hosts. such as cloud.drchaos.com, mail. drchaos.
com, sharepoint.drchaos.com. These all could be potential applications and
potentially high value targets.
Before we randomly start choosing hosts, we should query the DNS server to see
what entries exist. The best way to do that is to ask the DNS server to tell us. If the
DNS server is configured to allow zone transfers, it will give us a copy of all its entries.
[ 55 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
Kali ships with a tool named Fierce. Fierce will check to see if the DNS server allows
zone transfers. If zone transfers are permitted, Fierce will execute a zone transfer and
inform the user of the entries. If the DNS server does not allow zone transfers, Fierce
can be configured to brute force host names on a DNS server. Fierce is designed as
a Reconnaissance tool before you use a tool that requires you to know IP addresses,
such as Nmap.
To use Fierce, navigate to Information Gathering | DNS Analysis | Fierce.
Fierce will load into a terminal window as shown in the following screenshot.
To run the Fierce script, type the following command:
fierce.pl -dns thesecurityblogger.com
[ 56 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
The domain thesecurityblogger.com, shown in the preceding screenshot, has
a few hosts associated with it. We have accomplished our task. However, you can
see Fierce failed at completing a zone transfer. Fierce will try and brute force a zone
transfer using a word list or dictionary file if you have one defined. We did not,
because the goal of this section is to determine what hosts exist on the domain, not
necessarily at this point carry out a zone transfer attack. However, if your goal is
more inclusive than targeting web applications, you may want to explore this further
on your own.
We can now target a particular host and use tools like Nmap to proceed further in
mapping out our target. An important aspect of using Fierce is selecting a target
using very little network traffic, which is important for avoiding detection. We will
use Nmap to gather more information about our target later in this chapter.
Maltego – Information Gathering graphs
Maltego is a Reconnaissance tool built into Kali developed by Paterva. It is a
multipurpose Reconnaissance tool that can gather information using open and
public information on the Internet. It has some built-in DNS Reconnaissance, but
goes much deeper into fingerprinting your target and gathering intelligence on
them. It takes the information and displays the results in a graph for analysis.
To start Maltego, navigate to Application menu in Kali, and click on the Kali menu.
Then select Information Gathering | DNS Analysis | Maltego.
The first step when you launch Maltego is to register it. You cannot use the
application without registration.
[ 57 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
When you complete registration, you will be able to install Maltego and start using
the application.
Maltego has numerous methods of gathering information. The best way to use
Maltego is to take advantage of the startup wizard to select the type of information
you want to gather. Experienced users may want to start with a blank graph or skip
the wizard all together. The power of Maltego is that it lets you visually observe the
relationship between a domain, organization, and people. You can focus around a
specific organization, or look at an organization and its related partnerships from
DNS queries.
Depending on the scan options chosen, Maltego will let you perform the
following tasks:
• Associate an e-mail address to a person
• Associate websites to a person
• Verify an e-mail address
• Gather details from Twitter, including geolocation of pictures
[ 58 ]

Most of the features are self-explanatory and include how they are used under the
feature description. Maltego is used commonly to gather information and sometimes
used as the first step during a social engineering attack.
Nmap
Nmap stands for Network Mapper, and is used to scan hosts and services on
a network. Nmap has advanced features that can detect different applications
running on systems as well as services and OS fingerprinting features. It is one
of the most widely used network scanners making it very effective, but also very
detectable. We recommend using Nmap in very specific situations to
avoid triggering a target's defense systems.
For more information on how to use Nmap, see http://nmap.org/.
Additionally, Kali comes loaded with Zenmap. Zenmap gives Nmap a graphical
user interface (GUI) to run commands. Although there are many purists who will
tell you the command-line version is the best version because of its speed and
flexibility, Zenmap has come a long way and has incorporated most of the Nmap
features. Zenmap also offers exclusive features not offered in Nmap, such as
developing graphical representations of a scan, which can be used later by other
reporting systems.

To open Zenmap, go to the Backtrack menu. Navigate to Information Mapping |
DNS Analysis, and launch Zenmap.
You will notice under the Profile menu that there are several options to determine
what type of scan you would like to run, as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 60 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
The first step is creating a new profile. A profile in Zenmap allows a Penetration
Tester to create what type of scan to execute and what different options to include.
Navigate to the Profile menu and select New Profile or Command to create a new
profile, as shown in the following screenshot:
When you select New Profile or Command, the profile editor will launch. You will
need to give your profile a descriptive name. For example, you can call the profile My
First Scan or anything else you would like.
Optionally, you can give the profile a description. During your course of using
Zenmap you will probably create many profiles and make multiple scans. A natural
reflex may be to delete profiles post execution. Here is a word of advice: profiles
don't take any space and come handy when you want to recreate something. We
recommend being extremely descriptive in profile names and come up with a
standard naming method. I start all my profile description with the date, time,
description of my location, my target network scan location, and customer name.
[ 61 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
When you completed your description, click on the Scan tab. In the Targets section,
you will add what hosts or networks you would like to scan. This field can take
a range of IP addresses (10.0.1.1-255) or it can take a network in CIDR format
(10.0.1.0/24).
You can see option -A is selected by default to enable aggressive scanning. Aggressive
scanning will enable OS detection (-O), version detection (-sV), script scanning (-sC)
and traceroute (--traceroute). Essentially, aggressive scanning allows a user to turn on
multiple flags without the need of having to remember them.
Aggressive scan is considered intrusive, meaning it will be detected by most
security devices. An aggressive scan may go unnoticed if your target is an
extremely specific host, but regardless of the situation, it's recommended you
have the permission to scan before using this or scanning option. As a reminder,
completing the ACK in the three-way handshake with an unauthorized system is
considered illegal by the US standards.
We can use the information we received from our DNS Reconnaissance exercise to
target a very specific host. Before we do that, let's set a few common options first.
[ 62 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
Click on the Ping tab. Select the -Pn flag option so Nmap will not ping the host first.
When this flag is not set, Nmap will ping your target hosts and networks. Default
settings only perform scans on hosts that are considered alive or reachable. The -Pn
flag tells Nmap to scan a host even without a ping response. Although this makes
the scan considerably more lengthy, the –Pn flag allows Nmap to avoid a common
problem of not receiving a ping response when the ping requests are blocked by
security defenses.
Save changes made by clicking on the Save Changes button in the lower-right
hand corner. Once saved, select the Scan button on the top-right side of the screen
to start the scan. Notice your options and target that you configured in the profile
editor are listed.
The network Topology tab will give you a quick look at how your scan on the target
network was completed, and if you had to cross any routers. In this example, you see
the scan stayed local to the network.
[ 63 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
The Hosts tab will give a list of the hosts discovered.
When a host is selected, Zenmap will display a detailed list of the hosts, their
operating systems, and common services. In the following screenshot, you can
see one of our hosts is a satellite DVR/receiver combo.
[ 64 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
If you look at the scan window, you will not only see what ports are open on specific
hosts, but also what applications are running on those hosts. Notice that Nmap can
determine things, such as a server is running IIS 5.0 as a web server over port 80. The
scan results will yield the IP address of the server, the operating system the server is
running, as well as the web applications running on the host. Penetration Testers will
find these results valuable when they are searching for exploits against this host.
.
It is now possible for you to concentrate your efforts on the target's running web
services or port 80, because it is open.
Zenmap is the best way to get output from Nmap scans. Zenmap offers a rich
graphical user interface that displays scans that can be exported into different
formats, such as text or Microsoft Excel.
[ 65 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
Although there are many ways to get outputs from Nmap (for example, the authors
in this book prefer the command-line techniques) we have included this technique
because it is constantly referenced in many web penetration standards and is a
common way for people to use it.
In addition, several places in GUI for Zenmap allow the user to export graphics and
certain parts of the report in CSV files or image files. These exports are extremely
valuable when creating reports.
FOCA – website metadata Reconnaissance
Did you know every time you create a document, such as a Microsoft PowerPoint
presentation, Microsoft Word document, or PDF, metadata is left in the document?
[ 66 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
What is metadata? Metadata is data about data. It is descriptive information about
a particular data set, object, or resource, including how it is formatted as well as
when and by whom it was collected. Metadata can be useful to Penetration Testers,
because it contains information about the system where the file was created, such as:
• Name of users logged into the system
• Software that created the document
• OS of the system that created the document
FOCA is a security-auditing tool that will examine metadata from domains. You
can have FOCA use search engines to find files on domains or use local files.
FOCA is built into Kali; however, the version is dated. Best practice is downloading
the newest version. FOCA has traditionally been a Windows tool, and the newer
versions may be only available for Windows.
The latest version of FOCA can be downloaded at: http://www.informatica64.
com/DownloadFOCA (use Google Translate to see the page in English).
You will need to give your e-mail address at the bottom of the screen. You will
receive an e-mail with the download link. You will also receive updates when FOCA
has new releases.
1. The first thing to do after launching FOCA is create a new project, as shown
in the following screenshots:.
[ 67 ]

We recommend keeping all project files in one place. You should
create a new folder for each project.
2. Once you name your project and decide where you want to store the project
files, click on the Create button, as shown in the following screenshot:

3. Next thing to do is save your project file. Once you saved the project, click
on the Search All button so FOCA will use search engines to scan for
documents. Optionally, you can use local documents as well.
4. Right-click on the file and select the Download option, as shown in the
following screenshot:

In the following screenshot, you can see two people opened this document.
You can also determine Microsoft Office for the Mac and Adobe Photoshop were
used to create this document as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 71 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
In many cases, attackers will be able to see much more information and gather
intelligence about a target.
FOCA allows the user to save and index a copy of all the metadata. In addition,
each type of metadata file can be saved and copied. This gives a Penetration Tester
a wealth of information. Screenshots are usually used to give an overview of the
indexed files, along with a listing of all individual files. Finally, FOCA will allow a
Penetration Tester to download individual files that can be used as examples.
Summary
Reconnaissance is typically the most critical step in a Penetration Testing exercise
and can be the most time consuming. Any actions taken against a target is
customized around results from Reconnaissance previously performed. The more
data known about a target equates to the less likely to trigger alarms, as well as
better chance of identifying a way to compromise the target. It is recommended to
look at this chapter as a prerequisite to the remaining chapters in this textbook.
In this chapter, we focused on various ways to gather information about a target. We
showcased some popular free tools available on the Internet, as well as Information
Gathering utilities available in Kali Linux. At this point, you should be ready to
evaluate targets identified through Reconnaissance for possible exploitation.
The next chapter will focus on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web
applications and web servers.

Server-side Attacks
A server by definition is a dedicated computing system running services to users and
other computers on a network. Examples of service range from public services such
as online gaming to sharing sensitive files inside a large organization. In the context
of client-server architecture, a servers is a computer program running to serve
the requests of other programs, known as the "clients". Thus, the server performs
some computational task on behalf of "clients". The clients either run on the same
computer, or connect through the network. For example, a server would host a game
