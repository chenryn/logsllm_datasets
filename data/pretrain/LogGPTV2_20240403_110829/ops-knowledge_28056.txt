User: I'm trying to get the stdout of a process via POPEN as soon as it's there.
With gevent 1.0 readline() and read() still block process and wait for process to finish.
Any clues? And yes, I searched high and low for a simple solution. It has to be possible without threading, right?
Assistant: I solved this using a little hack. Just flush Pythons line-buffer w/ self.stream.flush() and a helper class whenever a line is written to stdout.
