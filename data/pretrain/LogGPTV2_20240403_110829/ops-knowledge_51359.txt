User: I'm planning to install Anaconda3 for Python 3.4. Since by default, Mac OS X uses Python2, will install Anaconda3 change the default Python version for the system? I don't want that to happen since Python3 can break backwards compatibility. If it does change the default Python version, how can I avoid that?
Assistant: No it won't, you can have multiple python installs, once you don't remove your system python or manually change the default you will be fine.
