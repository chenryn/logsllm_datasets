User: I realise this question may already exist, but the answers I've found haven't worked and I have a slightly different setup.
I have a python file /home/pi/python_games/frontend.py that I am trying to start when lxde loads by placing @python /home/pi/python_games/frontend.py in /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart.
It doesn't run and there are no error messages.
When trying to run python /home/pi/python_games/frontend.py, python complains about not being able to find the files that are loaded using relative links eg: /home/pi/python_games/image.png is called with image.png. Obviously one solution would be to give these resources absolute paths, but the python program also calls other python programs in its directory that also have relative paths, and I don't want to go changing all them.
Anyone got any ideas?
Thanks
Tom
Assistant: you could change your current working directory inside the script before you start calling your relative imports, use os.chdir("absolute path on where your script lives").
