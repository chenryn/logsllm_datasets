Abstract
The threat to organisations from network attacks
is very real. Current countermeasures to denial of
service (DoS) attacks rely on the perimeter model of
network security. However, as the case study and
analysis in this paper make apparent, the perimeter
model, which relies on firewalls and Intrusion
Detection Systems, is unable to provide an effective
defence against DoS attacks. Therefore, there is a need
for a new approach; one that
identifies an attack
beyond the perimeter. Within this paper, we present
such an approach. We achieve early detection of DoS
attacks by the identification of traffic signatures which
indicate that an attack is underway. As these signatures
can be identified 'outside' the perimeter, appropriate
measures can be taken to prevent
the attack from
succeeding. We use examples of DoS attacks and a case
study to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.  
1. Introduction
Computer security has three goals; confidentiality,
integrity, and availability [19]. Confidentiality requires
that assets of a computer system are accessible by only
those authorised to access them. Integrity is concerned
with ensuring that
the system's assets can only be
modified by authorised parties only in prescribed ways.
Availability refers to ensuring that system services and
data are accessible to authorised users when needed. An
attack may have an adverse effect on one, or a
combination of all the three characteristics. However,
there is an imbalance between real-life and research into
attacks on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The
CSI/FBI survey 2001 [20] notes that 27% of respondents
reported denial of service (DoS) attacks against their
systems. In research, partly due to the influence of the
military and their focus on secrecy, 90% of research
papers deal with confidentiality, 9% with authentication,
and 1% with availability [1]. Therefore, research into
defences against availability attacks is not congruent

scale of the DoS problem. However,
DoS attacks prevent a legal network user
from
performing his/her functions [17]. They overwhelm the
victim host
to the point of unresponsiveness to the
legitimate user of that host [5]. As demonstrated by the
CSI/FBI survey [20], these attacks are prevalent 'in the
wild'. With today's reliance on networks and computing
technologies, these attacks can have a serious effect on
the victim. 
Current
to DoS rely on the
perimeter model of network security. However,
this
model, which relies on firewalls and Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS), does not provide the defence required
against DoS attacks as long as these devices are an
internal part of the victim system. This is because they
only respond to an attack, rather than prevent them from
being successful. Consequently, when the attacks are
detected the services are shut down. This is supported by
our real case study presented later in this paper. 
countermeasures
The aim of this paper is to present a new approach for
early detection of DoS attacks. In this way, attacks can
be prevented from succeeding and resource availability
continues. In order to achieve this, our approach focuses
on
the
organisational perimeter. All traffic, whether valid or
invalid, must travel on this medium prior to reaching its
destination. In the perimeter model, attack signatures are
easily identifiable because they are present within a
communications medium beyond

finite, controlled and trusted boundary. However, this
policy enforcement is not available beyond the perimeter.
The novel contribution of this paper is that we provide an
alternative approach to the perimeter model for defence
against DoS attacks. To achieve this, we present new,
generic signatures that can be identified regardless of
traffic levels before the attack traffic reaches
the
perimeter of the intended victim. To demonstrate the
applicability of our approach and the signatures required
in early detection, we apply them to trace data from real
DoS attacks and present our results. 
This paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we
provide an overview of DoS attacks. In section 3, we
discuss the perimeter security model and its weaknesses
in the face of DoS attacks. In section 4, we demonstrate
these perimeter model weaknesses through a case study
and the analysis of a DoS attack. In section 5, we present
our approach for early detection of DoS attacks beyond
the perimeter, which is based on the communications
medium and has different signature requirements from
the perimeter model. In section 6, we present our future
work. In section 7, we make our conclusions.

With today's
reliance on networks and computing
technologies, these attacks can have a serious effect on
the victim. For example, an attack on a single host, such
as a home user, may prevent a transaction from taking
place. At
the Local Area Network (LAN) level, an
organisation may be prevented from conducting its
business due to key elements of the LAN infrastructure
being affected by an attack. In the extreme [24], an entire
organisation may be forced to close operations.
Whilst
there are a number of options open to a
malicious person wishing to launch a DoS attack, there
are two principal classifications of attack; resource
starvation and bandwidth consumption [5, 13, 15, 26].
Resource starvation attacks [16] attempt to consume all
resources on their target so that
they are unable to

example, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) SYN
flooding [5] uses up all their victim's resources with half-
open requests for connection. E-mail subscription attacks
[2], where a user is signed up to receive a large amount
of junk mail, use up the e-mail resources of the victim.
Bandwidth consumption attacks are when an attacker
sends more data at the victim host than it is able to deal
with, filling all communications channels with data. For

The situation is further complicated by the emergence
of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) tools, such as
"trinoo"
[7],
"mstream" [8], etc. Before the emergence of DDoS
tools, DoS techniques were focused on simple point-to-
point attacks. However, by combining a number of
attacking computers in a single attack, an attacker is able
to direct more traffic at the victim. This nullifies the fact
that the attacker's system was slower than that of the
victim. For example, the attack on Yahoo in February
2000 [10] directed approximately 630Gb of data to the
site in a 3 hour period. DDoS tools also enable the
attacker to switch between attack types during an attack.
For example, TFN [7] is capable of ICMP flood, TCP
SYN flood, UDP flood, and "Smurf" style attacks. 
The effectiveness of DoS attacks has been much
reported in recent years, even though organisations
continue to employ perimeter model security devices.
Cases such as the Cloud Nine incident [24] and the case
study to be presented in this paper demonstrate that
despite the protection afforded by these devices to
technological and information resources, DoS attacks
can still occur. Countermeasures supporting perimeter
model devices include techniques such as ingress/egress
filtering at the ISP level to prevent attack packets from
leaving the attacker's network in the first place. The
number of attacks observed in [16] demonstrate that
despite the implementation of this support filtering, a
large number of attacks are still able to cause damage to
their victim. Protection of all organisational network
assets, including perimeter model devices, is required to
combat the DoS problem.

infrastructures. This security model divides network
architectures into two distinct groups;
trusted and
untrusted . The trusted group is often the finite internal
infrastructure, whilst the untrusted consists of infinite
external networks. To maintain this segregation of trust

and out of the network perimeter, and where the security

policies for the organisation pertaining to network traffic
are enforced. Firewalls come in varying levels of
sophistication [19], from packet filters to bastion hosts.
However, network-level firewalls have in common that
access to hosts, networks or services is usually controlled
using rules based on IP addresses, ports, IP flags, and
network interfaces [3]. 
Intrusion detection [21] is the art of detecting and
responding to computer misuse. It attempts to deal with
the problem of identifying individuals who are using a
computer system without authorisation or those that have
legitimate access to the system but are misusing their
privileges [25]. In reality, intrusion detection is often
satisfied with identifying hosts of attacks rather than
human perpetrators behind the attacks. This is due to the
latter involving the co-operation of law enforcement
agencies. Unlike
firewalls, which enforce security
policies, IDS detect violations of the security policies
within the trusted domain. There are two main types of
IDS: host-based IDS and network-based IDS. A host-
based IDS detects attacks by watching for suspicious
activity on a single computer system. Network-based IDS
[22] are driven by interpretation of raw network traffic.
They attempt to detect attacks by watching for suspicious
patterns in network traffic within a defined perimeter.
for
DoS attacks are a potent weapon in an attacker's
armoury against perimeter model devices
two
reasons. First, in a primary attack, the objective of the
attack may be to degrade or halt services of the perimeter
model device itself. For example, if the firewall is unable
to respond [11], it may degrade or halt Internet access for
all its users. Second, they can be used as a diversionary
tactic to mask another attack. Normally, attacks are
characterised by some noise or other indication of an
intruder attempting to compromise the target host or
system [14]. Using a DoS attack as camouflage, the real
attack is less likely to be observed. Thus, whilst security
analysts attempt to stem the flood of packets being sent
to the target in the DoS attack, particular packets can be
hidden in the flood to break into the target system. 
For either reason, DoS attacks are an effective attacker
strategy in reaching their attack objective. For example,
for either primary or diversionary attacks to work, the
attacker must choose a tool to flood the target perimeter
model device with as many packets as possible. The aim
is not to fill the bandwidth with attack packets and deny
legitimate connections, but to make the security device
log all attack packets. If the security device logs these
packets as suspicious, the attacker can cause the device to
fill all hard disk space with audit information. A DDoS
tool, "Stick" [12], has already been seen in the wild that
specifically targets IDS by sending spurious packets to
fill up event logs.  
4. DoS - a case study 
Recently, we conducted research into the internal
threat to a large network [for further details, see 11].
During the research period, a number of security
incidents came to light and were captured for analysis.
This included a real major DoS incident caused by worm
infection. This case study provides us with the
opportunity of analysing a real network security event
within a defined perimeter to identify issues requiring
redress. First, we are able to see the effect that a DoS
attack has on perimeter model security devices. Second,
it highlights the problem that whilst the perimeter model
architecture is in use, an adequate defence against DoS
is not possible solely with these perimeter devices.  
In order to ascertain the internal threat to the network,
an IDS was used on a control machine. BlackICE
Defender was chosen as the IDS to be used on the
control machine for the duration of the research for two
reasons. First, an IDS had to be chosen that ran on
Microsoft OSs as the network contained no UNIX
machines. Second, the machine had to look like a users’
machine and not stand out
to the casual observer.
Therefore, software that a user may use, rather than an
administrator,  was seen as more appropriate.  
The root of all
intrusion detection is based on
analysing a set of discrete, time sequenced events for
patterns of misuse [21]. These events then form Events
of Interest (EOI) [18] within the system. These EOI are
possible attacks against the target machine or network.
One issue identified within our research was the number
