User: Running a python script on different nodes at school using SSH.  Each node has 8 cores. I use GNU Screen to be able to detach from a single process.
Is it more desirable to:

Run several different sessions of screen.
Run a single screen process and use & in a bash terminal. 

Are they equivalent?
I am not sure if my experiments are poorly coded and taking an inordinate amount of time (very possible) OR my choice to use 1. is slowing the process down considerably.  Thank you!
Assistant: I would think they are about the same.  I would prefer screen just because I have an easier time managing it.  Depending on the scripts usage, that could also have some effect on time to process.
