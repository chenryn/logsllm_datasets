### Title: Fuzzing and Breaking Security Functions of SIMATIC PLCs

#### Abstract
Siemens SIMATIC Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are widely used in critical infrastructure, including energy, water, power, and oil and gas industries. With the increasing number of attacks targeting these infrastructures, Siemens introduced TIA V17 in May 2021, which includes enhanced security features such as improved TLS communication protocols, data encryption, and access protection. However, it is crucial to assess whether these security measures can be breached. This presentation will focus on the following aspects:

- Cracking the TLS secure communication protocol
- Fuzzing testing for security protocols
- High-risk vulnerability analysis
- Access protection and authorization authentication

#### Introduction
Siemens SIMATIC PLCs, particularly the S7-1500 and S7-1200 models, are commonly deployed in critical infrastructure. The latest version, TIA V17, introduces several new security features, including enhanced TLS communication, data encryption, and access protection. Despite these enhancements, there may still be vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

#### Workflow and Vulnerabilities of TLS Secure Communication Protocol
- **TLS Communication Protocol**: We will explain the workflow of the TLS secure communication protocol, including the use and storage of certificates and their relationship with the S7CommPlus protocol.
- **Rogue Engineer Station**: Using this knowledge, we will demonstrate how to create a rogue engineer station capable of controlling an S7-1500 PLC with the latest firmware. This will include operations such as starting, stopping, uploading projects, and modifying control logic.

#### Fuzzing Testing for TLS Secure Communication Protocol
- **Fuzzing Design and Implementation**: We will detail the design and implementation of fuzzing for the TLS secure communication protocol.
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: Using fuzzing tools, we will identify crash vulnerabilities in S7+. Currently, only three of these vulnerabilities have been addressed, with at least five more under investigation and expected to be patched soon.

#### Password Level Protection Mechanism
- **Access Protection**: The password level protection mechanism is designed to prevent unauthorized operations. However, even with access protection enabled, the S7-1500/S7-1200 PLCs are vulnerable to CVE-2021-37185 and CVE-2021-37205.
- **UAF Vulnerability Analysis**: We will provide a detailed analysis of the UAF (Use After Free) type vulnerability (CVE-2021-37205).

#### Bypassing Access Protection
- **Pass the Hash Method**: In TIA versions â‰¤V16, the S7-1200 access protection level password can be bypassed using the pass-the-hash method.
- **TIA V17 Authorization Process**: We will examine whether it is possible to bypass access protection in TIA V17 and provide a detailed explanation of the authorization process.

#### Defensive Strategies and Recommendations
- **Risk Mitigation**: Finally, we will offer defensive strategies and recommendations to help PLC users protect their equipment from the identified risks.

By understanding these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended defenses, users can enhance the security of their SIMATIC PLCs and better protect their critical infrastructure.
