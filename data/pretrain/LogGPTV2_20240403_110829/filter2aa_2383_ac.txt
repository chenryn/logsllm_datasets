### Probability-Based Attacks and Metadata Analysis in Anonymity Networks

#### Introduction to Probability-Based Attacks
I am not yet finished with my discussion. Unlike the topics I have covered previously, I will now delve into probability-based attacks. These attacks are based on formulating a hypothesis that certain properties (Property X) of messages can be correlated with a higher probability than random chance. However, without control or test messages, it is impossible to verify if the hypothesis holds true. Since I lack controls, my approach involves generating a hypothesis, running it across the dataset, and then examining the resulting clusters of messages. If I can identify another factor that correlates these messages, I consider the hypothesis successful.

For example, if a message header has a specific value (X), I hypothesize that it indicates a unique sender. Running this analysis, I might find clusters of messages encrypted with a single public key. If there were no correlation, the distribution of public keys would be random. This implies that even without other distinguishing characteristics, the hypothesis can help identify meaningful clusters.

#### Message Headers and Their Implications
My first example involves message headers, which are a significant area of focus. There are a few headers common to almost every message, but a long tail of headers that appear only in a few. However, these unique headers may not be as valuable as they seem because they can be added by various entities: the client, exit remailer, mail2news gateway, or Usenet peer.

To target headers added by the client, I must subtract out headers added by other parts of the path. Here are some examples of headers specified by the client:

- **Unique Subject "Weed Will Save The Planet"**: A distinct clump of messages with this subject demonstrates how unique message headers can correlate messages.
- **X-No-Archive Header**: This header instructs Usenet servers not to save the message. A misspelling of this header uniquely identifies over 17,300 messages, all with the subject "forforums."
- **Correct Version of X-No-Archive**: About 135,000 messages (over 10%) had this header, making it a distinguishing feature.
- **Encrypt-Subject Header**: This should be processed by Type I remailers and never reach Usenet. Over 10,000 messages with this header indicate a bug, and reusing subjects makes messages stand out.
- **Encrypt-Key Header**: Another header that should not appear in Usenet but does due to the complexity of Type I remailers. Over 10,000 messages contain this header.

#### Newsgroups and Other Headers
- **Newsgroups Header**: Posting to multiple newsgroups is rare and can segment users. For instance, 34 messages posted to a specific newsgroup, all with the same subject and unique headers, make Comcast users highly distinguishable.
- **AAM with 4 Commas**: Initially thought to be a correlation attack, this was actually caused by a bug in 'remailer.org.uk' for a week in January 2006.
- **Duplicated Newsgroups**: Messages with duplicated newsgroups, sent through various remailers, and having English subjects, confirm that using unique newsgroups is a bad idea.

#### Human Behavior and Remailer Usage
Humans tend to stick with configurations that work, making it easier to partition users by the remailer and newsgateway they use. This can reveal who is participating in discussions and whether they are supporting or arguing with themselves. Adding header signatures further simplifies this process.

- **Redundant Messages**: Some users duplicate messages for redundancy, which can be a distinguishing feature. Targeting a nym with a large message and observing two large messages appearing close together can identify message duplication.
- **Time-Delayed Messages**: Messages from different remailers with a slight time delay (e.g., dizum and panta-rhei) also stand out and are distinguishing.

#### Future of Anonymity Networks
While AAM (Anonymous Mail) has its obvious mistakes and suffers from outdated practices, there are lessons in traffic analysis that need to be codified as best practices. The future of AAM depends on several factors:

- **Security of Well-Posted Messages**: Good security requires uncrackable passphrases, key-stretched packets, and posting through remailers with no distinguishing characteristics. However, AAM's small user base makes it vulnerable to targeted attacks.
- **Remailers and Newsgateways**: These services are declining, with a few individuals (Zax and Dizum) handling most of the traffic. AAM is also text-based, limiting bandwidth.
- **Nymservs**: Architecturally weak, nymservs rely on trust, similar to single-hop proxies like VPNs and UltraSurf. Using Tor to send email via throwaway accounts is a common but flawed practice.

#### Pynchon Gate and Mixminion
Pynchon Gate, designed by Len Sassaman, Bram Cohen, and Nick Mathewson, uses Private Information Retrieval to expose less metadata and resist correlation attacks. However, it is not yet built and requires a remailer network to operate. Mixminion, while better than Mixmaster, still faces issues such as spam, abuse, and poor documentation. Improving Mixminion is crucial for the future of high-bandwidth, high-latency anonymity networks.

#### Conclusion
There is currently no anonymity network that can securely share high-bandwidth content like the Collateral Murder video. Workarounds, such as using Tor and third-party services, have their limitations. We need to develop better solutions, and I hope to inspire you to contribute to this effort. Thank you.
