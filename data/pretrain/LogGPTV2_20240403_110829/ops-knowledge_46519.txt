User: How to write a REST API client via python to retrieve data from a remote server?
Assistant: To write a REST API client in Python, you can use Python's requests library. The following is a simple code example for retrieving data in JSON format from a remote server: ```python import requests # Initiate a GET request response = requests.get('http://example.com/api/data') # Convert the response content to data in JSON format data = response.json() # process data for item in data: print(item['key']) ``` In this example, the code uses the requests library to initiate a GET request . The request returns a JSON-formatted data that is converted to a dictionary object in Python. This object can be used to manipulate the data, for example to print the "key" values of all items. If you still need to send data to the server, you can use code similar to the above: ```python import requests # Prepare data data = { 'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2' } # Initiate a POST request response = requests.post('http://example.com/api/data', json=data) # Process the response if response.status_code == 200: print('Data submitted successfully') else: print('Request failed: ', response.status_code) ``` This example uses a POST request to send a data dictionary containing two items to the server. The code will print a message after a successful submission. If the request fails, the response status code is printed.
