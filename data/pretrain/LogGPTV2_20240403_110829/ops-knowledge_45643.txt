I am currently using a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.6.6 (Snow Leopard), which comes pre-installed with Python 2.6. I have also installed Python 2.7.1. However, it seems that Python 2.7.1 is unable to recognize the Twisted installation located in the `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Extras/lib/python/twisted` directory. When I attempt to import modules from this directory, I encounter issues even though the modules are present.

When I run `which python`, it returns:
```
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
```

And running `python` gives me:
```
Python 2.7.1 (r271:86882M, Nov 30 2010, 10:35:34)
```

I have tried adding the absolute path of the Twisted directory to `sys.path` and also added it to my `.bash_profile`. My current `.bash_profile` looks like this:
```sh
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}"
PATH=$PATH:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Extras/lib/python/twisted
export PATH
```

Despite these efforts, I am still unable to get Python 2.7.1 to recognize the Twisted installation. Is there a way to resolve this issue, or am I attempting something that is not possible?

Thank you for your help.

**Assistant:**

To resolve this issue, I recommend using `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment. This will allow you to manage your Python packages more effectively without interfering with the system-wide Python installation. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already:**
   ```sh
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. **Create a new virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   virtualenv myenv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```sh
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Twisted in the newly created virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   pip install twisted
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to use Twisted with Python 2.7.1 in a controlled and isolated environment. This approach avoids potential conflicts with the system-wide Python installation and ensures that all necessary dependencies are properly managed.
