User: I have a new MacBook Pro running OS X 10.6.6 / Snow Leopard -- which ships with Python 2.6, although I have installed 2.7.1
Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to see the Twisted install in the 2.6/Extras/lib/python/twisted directory, as I find I'm unable to import modules that I can see are present in that directory.
"which python" returns "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python"
and running python returns the same: "Python 2.7.1 (r271:86882M, Nov 30 2010, 10:35:34)"
I have added the twisted directory (absolute) to sys.path, and I have added it to .bash_profile, which now consists of the following:
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}"
PATH=$PATH:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Extras/lib/python/twisted
export PATH
Any ideas how I can get 2.7.1 to see the Twisted install? Or am I trying to do something that just can't be done?
thanks.
Assistant: Create an environment using virtualenv.
Install Twisted in your newly created environment using pip.
