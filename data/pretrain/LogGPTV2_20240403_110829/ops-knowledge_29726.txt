User: How to automatically build and deploy applications through Jenkins? Please provide relevant settings and examples for Jenkins.
Assistant: Jenkins is an open source automation tool that helps users automatically build and deploy applications. The following are the steps to automatically build and deploy applications through Jenkins: 1. Install Jenkins and start the service. You can download Jenkins from the official website and install it according to the documentation. After the installation is complete, start the Jenkins service. 2. Create a new project In the Jenkins interface, click "New Task" on the left panel, then select "Build a free-style software project", enter the project name and save it. 3. Configure Git version management and code pull Select "Source Code Management" in the project configuration interface, and select Git for version control. Enter the Git warehouse address and credential information, select the branch to pull, and save it after the configuration is complete. 4. Configure build steps Select "Build" on the project configuration page, and add build steps that need to be executed, such as compiling, testing, packaging, etc., which can be implemented by executing shell commands or calling specific tasks. 5. Configure post-build steps Select "Post-build operations" on the project configuration page to configure some post-build operations, such as archiving build results and publishing them to specified servers. 6. Configure build triggers Select "Build triggers" on the project configuration page, and you can choose triggers such as regular execution of builds, Git triggers execution of builds, and build completion triggers other tasks. 7. Save and start the build After configuring the above steps, save the settings and start the automatic build with "Build Now". After the build is complete, you can view the build log and build results, and if the build is successful, you can execute the deployment operation. The above steps are the general process of automatically building and deploying applications through Jenkins, and the specific implementation can be adjusted according to project requirements.
