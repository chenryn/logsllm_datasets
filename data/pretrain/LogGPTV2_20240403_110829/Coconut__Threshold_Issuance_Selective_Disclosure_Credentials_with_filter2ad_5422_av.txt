The designs described in Section IV-A and Section IV-B
rely on authorities on-the-side for issuing credentials. In this
section, we present designs that incorporate Coconut authori-
ties within the infrastructure of a number of semi-permissioned
blockchains. This enables the issuance of credentials as a side
effect of the normal system operations, taking no additional
dependency on extra authorities. It remains an open problem
how to embed Coconut into permissionless systems, based on
proof of work or stake. These systems have a highly dynamic
set of nodes maintaining the state of their blockchains, which
cannot readily be mapped into Coconut issuing authorities.
Integration of Coconut into Hyperledger Fabric [15]—a
permissioned blockchain platform—is straightforward. Fabric
contracts run on private sets of computation nodes—and use
the Fabric protocols for cross-contract calls. In this setting,
Coconut issuing authorities can coincide with the Fabric smart
contract authorities. Upon a contract setup, they perform the
setup and key distribution, and then issue partial credentials
when authorized by the contract. For issuing Coconut cre-
dentials, the only secrets maintained are the private issuing
keys; all other operations of the contract can be logged and
publicly veriﬁed. Coconut has obvious advantages over using
traditional CL credentials relying on a single authority—as
currently present in the Hyperledger roadmap9. The threshold

trust assumption—namely that
guaranteed under the corruption of a subset of authorities is
preserved, and prevents forgeries by a single corrupted node.
We can also naturally embed Coconut into sharded scalable
blockchains, as exempliﬁed by Chainspace [1] (which supports
general smart contracts), and Omniledger [34] (which supports
digital tokens). In these systems, transactions are distributed
and executed on ‘shards’ of authorities, whose membership
and public keys are known. Coconut authorities can naturally
