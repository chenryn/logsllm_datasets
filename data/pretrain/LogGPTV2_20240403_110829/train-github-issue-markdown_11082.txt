I have been playing around with the **Firebase ML Vision**
https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_ml_vision and have so far
integrated the Text recognition within my application. My issue here is that I
have my UI which is a live camera feed and every time I call the Firebase ML
vision, I see about 1-2 seconds lag/freeze which affects my UI. I managed to
narrow this down to this line of code from the Firebase ML API
        final results =
            (() async => (await detector.detectInImage(visionImage) ?? []));
I have since tried to implement the whole call to the API from sending the
capture from the camera feed to the FirebaseVisionDetector object but no avail
with errors along the lines to do with if I remember right, something like the
routine has to be called from the main isolate. I can successfully implement a
**compute** function without this API. I have a feeling is something to do
with the fact that it is an external package.
Any help will be appreciated as I am seeking a smooth UI interaction and
transition within the App.
