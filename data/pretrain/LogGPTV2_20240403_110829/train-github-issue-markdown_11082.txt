I have been experimenting with **Firebase ML Vision** (https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_ml_vision) and have successfully integrated text recognition into my application. However, I am encountering an issue where the UI, which displays a live camera feed, experiences a 1-2 second lag or freeze every time I call the Firebase ML Vision API. I have traced this problem to the following line of code from the Firebase ML API:

```dart
final results = (async () => (await detector.detectInImage(visionImage) ?? []));
```

To address this, I attempted to move the entire API call, from capturing the camera feed to passing it to the `FirebaseVisionDetector` object, but encountered errors related to the requirement that the routine must be called from the main isolate. I can successfully use a `compute` function without this API, leading me to suspect that the issue is related to the fact that Firebase ML Vision is an external package.

I would greatly appreciate any assistance in resolving this, as I aim to achieve smooth UI interactions and transitions within the app.
