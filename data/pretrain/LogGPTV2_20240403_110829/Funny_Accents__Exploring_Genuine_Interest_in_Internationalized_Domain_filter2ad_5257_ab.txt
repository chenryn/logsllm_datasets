WHOIS Records. To obtain ownership information for the domains in our data
set, we retrieve and parse their WHOIS records with the Ruby Whois library [7].
However, WHOIS data has several limitations, especially for bulk and automated
processing. The format of WHOIS data varies widely between providers (which
can be registries or registrars); it may be human-readable, but both parser-based
and statistical methods cannot retrieve all information ﬂawlessly [42]. Moreover,
rate limits prevent bulk data collection.
Even if data can be adequately obtained, it may not be of high quality. Reg-
istrant details can contain private contact information, so privacy concerns and
malicious intent have spurred a number of privacy and proxy services, whose
details replace those of the real owner [9]. The European General Data Pro-
tection Regulation (GDPR) has also cast doubt on whether such data can still
be released [32], with e.g. the .de registry already withholding any personal
details [13]. Finally, WHOIS data may be outdated, e.g. not reﬂecting company
name changes, or the same registrant may use diﬀerent data across domains.
Web Pages. To determine what content the accented and non-accented domains
serve, we visit the root page for each domain pair where the IDN has a valid
A record. By limiting our crawl to one page, we minimize the impact on the
servers hosting the websites. As with our title crawl, we use a real browser to
capture the request and response headers, the redirection path and ﬁnal URL of
the response, TLS certiﬁcate data, the HTML source and a screenshot.
To classify domains, we ﬁrst compute a perceptual hash of the screenshot
based on the discrete cosine transform [37]. As visually similar images have simi-
lar hash values, we cluster their pairwise Hamming distances using DBSCAN [18]
to ﬁnd groups of websites with (nearly) the same content, which we then man-
ually label. We also compare the hashes of the original domain and its IDN to
detect equal but non-redirecting domains. Finally, for domains that were not

classiﬁed using their hash, we check for the presence of certain keywords (e.g.
‘parking’) in the HTML source, or else decide that we cannot classify the domain.
Blacklists. To detect whether our candidate IDNs exhibit malicious behavior,
we match them and the domains they redirect to against the current blacklists
provided by Google Safe Browsing [23] (malware and phishing), PhishTank [53]
(phishing), Spamhaus DBL [60] (spam), SURBL [62] (spam, phishing, malware
and cracking) and VirusTotal [8] (malware).
3.3 Limitations
We restrict our search to IDNs with variations on characters of the Latin alpha-
bet. Our exploration could be broadened to popular domains that are a roman-
ized (converted to Latin alphabet) version of brands or phrases in another char-
acter set. However, a script often has multiple romanization standards that may
(Yandex) can be romanized to
be language-dependent [64]: for example,
Iandeks, Jandeks or Yandeks. We therefore ignore other character sets to avoid
false positives and negatives caused by these diﬀering systems.
Our approach to select candidate IDNs is conservative: our requirement that
whole words from the title and domain match, may mean that we miss some
candidate IDNs, e.g. if the domain is an abbreviation of words in the title.
However, through this approach we limit erroneous candidate IDNs, which we
estimate would more likely be either unregistered or maliciously used, as no one
would have a genuine interest in owning the domain.
4 Results
In this section, we determine whether IDNs with genuine interest share owner-
ship with the popular domain they are based on, and for what purpose they are
used. Through a crawl conducted between 30 August and 28 September 2018, we
were able to retrieve a non-empty title from the root page of 849 341 out of 1 mil-
lion domains (website rankings are known to contain unreachable domains [39]).
Using the process described in Sect. 3.1, we generated 15 276 candidate IDNs.

Fig. 1. Cumulative distribution functions for the creation dates of registered IDNs.
4.1 Registration and Ownership
Table 2 lists whether our candidate IDNs with genuine interest are still available
for registration. Of the 79.1% unregistered IDNs, 11.3% do not comply with their
respective TLD’s LGR policy, meaning that an owner of a popular domain can-
not register the corresponding IDN and loses out on the user experience beneﬁts.
Through the GoDaddy API, we ﬁnd that 43.3% of all candidate IDNs are read-
ily available; 26.9% are unavailable for registration, because the registry either
blocks visually similar registrations or applies further restrictions to registrants,
which could also increase the burden for a malicious registration.
For the 20.9% registered domains, we compare the DNS (Table 3b) and
WHOIS (Table 3c) records and web crawl data (Tables 3e and f) to estimate
whether the original domain and its IDN have the same owner (summarized in
Table 3a). For 50.0%, we believe both domains to have the same owner: they
have overlapping WHOIS contact data, have the same A record, serve the same
web content and/or present a TLS certiﬁcate for the same domains. For an
additional 9.1%, shared nameservers or SOA records also allow us to reasonably
assume shared ownership. For 34.6%, we believe both domains to have a diﬀerent
owner: either their NS and SOA records are both diﬀerent, or the domain is parked
or for sale. Brand owners would be unlikely to use the latter for monetizing their
IDN, as they could better serve the actual website the visitor is looking for, and
the domain would not be displaying content from a third party.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of creation dates of the IDNs. Brand owners
tend to have registered their IDNs earlier than average, while domain squatters
registered them later (Fig. 1a). The majority of IDNs was registered after the
original domain, although 3.7% of IDNs were registered earlier (Fig. 1b).
In our data set, we can see examples of companies that do or do not cover
IDNs when protecting their brand on the Internet. Nestl´e, L’Or´eal, M¨omax and
Citro¨en own several candidate IDNs, usually redirecting to the original domain,
but still see some owned by third parties for parking. We also see 40 IDNs bought
by brand protectors such as CSC, Nameshield and SafeBrands for their clients.
However, the lack of support for certain characters hinders some companies in
owning IDNs with genuine interest: e.g. the ˇS character in ˇSkoda sees little
support by TLD registries, causing relatively low IDN ownership.
4.2 Usage
Table 3d lists whether the IDNs host a website: 14.3% of registered IDNs have
no conﬁgured A record, suggesting proactive registration without the intention
to use the IDN. Table 3e lists what content the domains that returned HTTP
status code 200 serve, with 53.8% displaying the same content as the original
domain, meaning that they are very likely owned and operated by the same
entity. 112 IDNs are even treated equally by not redirecting to the original;
however, none of the original domains redirect to the IDN. 30.5% are parked/for
sale, while 5.4% show an empty/default page (e.g. unconﬁgured server).
Manual inspection of the domains that could not be classiﬁed shows that
these largely fall into two categories. The ﬁrst consists of websites that are com-
pletely diﬀerent to the original domain, owned by another entity. This can lever-
age the popularity of the original domain, and is an opportunity to own domains
with desirable phrases, but also exposes end users to confusion and potential mis-
direction. The second has the IDN showing slightly diﬀerent or older versions
of the original domain. This indicates that they both belong to the same owner
and that there was an intention to use the IDN, but that it was forgotten when
the original domain was reconﬁgured and now points to an outdated website.
4.3 Security
Incidence on blacklists is very low: none of our candidate IDNs, nor the domains
they redirect to appear on the Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank, Spamhaus or
SURBL blacklists. VirusTotal reports malware detections on 5 domains, but only
by at most 3 out of 67 engines; these detections appear to be based on outdated
information. However, Tian et al. [66] have found that over 90% of phishing
sites served through squatting domains could evade blacklisting, meaning that
phishing may already be much more prevalent on our candidate IDNs. Finally,
parked domains are known to only sometimes redirect to malicious content [68]:
we manually saw instances of such intermittent redirects to blacklisted sites for
several IDNs.
186
V. Le Pochat et al.
Through inspection of the redirection paths, we found no proof of aﬃliate
abuse on IDNs (sending users to the intended domain, but adding an aﬃliate
ID to earn a sales commission), as has been seen for several domain squatting
techniques [47]. We manually found examples of other, questionable behavior:
pok´emongo.com oﬀers a “cheat code” in an online survey scam [33], and has
a cryptocurrency miner [17,54]; jmon´ae.com redirects to the original domain
through an ad-based URL shortener [49]; and www.preußische-allgemeine.de
includes the site of a competing newspaper in a frame (Fig. 2).
From the WHOIS records, we ﬁnd 81 domains to use a privacy/proxy service;
while abusive domains tend to use such services [9], using them does not reliably
demonstrate malicious intent [36]. Moreover, privacy concerns as well as the
GDPR make that some registries and registrars hide private information by
default, reducing the need to procure a privacy/proxy service.
As the web is rapidly adopting HTTPS, IDNs will also need a correct TLS
setup for users to reach them without trouble. However, for the 2 166 reachable
IDNs in our TLS crawl, Table 3f shows that only 7.9% are securely conﬁgured and
would not cause a browser warning. The other domains either have an insecure
setup (mostly because the presented certiﬁcate does not cover the IDN) or do
not allow a TLS connection to be established.
For the domains with shared ownership, 60.2% are insecure or don’t allow
a TLS connection even though the original domain is securely conﬁgured. For
360 (26.9%) IDNs, the presented certiﬁcate is valid only for the original domain,
suggesting that the domain owner has set up the original domain and the IDN
identically, but has forgotten to obtain a certiﬁcate that is also valid for the IDN.
5 User Agent Behavior
Throughout the DNS protocol, the A-label (Punycode) of an IDN is used to
maintain backward compatibility. However, developers of user interfaces may
elect to display the U-label (Unicode) to provide the best user experience, as the
A-label is less readable (e.g. k¨oln.de becomes xn- -kln-sna.de). In this section, we
discuss the behavior of user agents regarding IDNs with diacritical marks from
the Latin script, where the lack of homoglyphs makes abuse more diﬃcult to
prevent. We also uncover two edge cases that have an impact both on the value
of IDNs to brand owners and on the vulnerability to IDN abuse.
Table 4 shows that popular web browsers and email clients vary widely in
whether they show the A- or U-label when visiting a website or receiving email.
The Gmail app on Android is a particular case, as it shows either the U-label or
the A-label when email is received on a Gmail or IMAP account respectively.
Browsers based on Chromium, such as Chrome and several Android browsers,
implement a special policy toward IDNs resembling very popular domains: the A-
label is shown when the domain with diacritics removed appears on a hardcoded
list based on Alexa’s top 10 000 [1]. This policy aﬀects 125 candidate IDNs, of
which 74 are registered with 21 having the same owner: these cannot choose
to prefer the IDN without aﬀecting user experience. 2 domains already do not
redirect, causing the display of the A-label. The seemingly arbitrary cut-oﬀ [58],

ation” characters straße.de. ‘A’ denotes the display of the A-label, ‘U’ of the U-label.

manual addition of domains and lack of updates [57] suggest that this heuristic
solution using a hardcoded list still leaves room for successful spooﬁng attacks.
