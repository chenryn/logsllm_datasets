Abstract—Customers of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic
testing services routinely download their raw genetic data and
give it to third-party companies that support additional features.
One type of analysis, called genetic genealogy, uses genetic
data and genealogical methods to ﬁnd new relatives. While
genetic genealogy is quite popular, it has raised new privacy
concerns. Genetic genealogy services can be leveraged to ﬁnd
the person corresponding to anonymous genetic data and have
been used dozens of times by law enforcement to solve crimes. We
hypothesized that the open design and broad API offered by some
genetic genealogy services raise other signiﬁcant security and
privacy issues. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the security
practices of GEDmatch, the largest third-party genetic genealogy
service. Here, we experimentally show how the GEDmatch API
is vulnerable to a number of attacks from an adversary that only
uploads normally formatted genetic data ﬁles and runs standard
queries. Using a small number of speciﬁcally designed ﬁles and
queries, an attacker can extract a large percentage of the genetic
markers from other users; 92% of markers can be extracted
with 98% accuracy, including hundreds of medically sensitive
markers. We also ﬁnd that an adversary can construct genetic
data ﬁles that falsely appear like relatives to other samples in the
database; in certain situations, these false relatives can be used
to make the re-identiﬁcation of genetic data more difﬁcult. These
attacks are possible because of the rich set of features supported
by the API, including detailed visualizations, that are meant to
enhance usability. We conclude with security recommendations
for genetic genealogy services.
I.
INTRODUCTION
At-home direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing is now
commonplace; more than 25 million people have taken DTC
genetic tests and over 100 million are expected to be tested in
the next few years [34]. The dramatic rise in DNA testing
has given consumers unprecedented access to their genetic
information so they can learn about their health, ancestry,
and family history. A popular feature offered by DTC testing
companies is to let customers download their raw genetic
results into genetic data ﬁles (GDFs) so they can analyze their
own data. This feature has created a demand for specialized
third-party analysis companies to help users analyze these
raw GDFs. Third-party services do not generate genetic data
directly; rather, they offer databases and tools to store and
analyze it. In this paper, we focus on third-party services that
specialize at the intersection of genetics and genealogy, known
as genetic genealogy.
The main goal of genetic genealogy is to predict new famil-
ial relations using genetic information. This technique, known
as relative matching, relies on algorithms that can predict the
relatedness of two individuals by comparing their two GDFs.
Intuitively, these algorithms rely on the fact that contiguous
DNA segments are passed from parents to their children in a
predictable manner, and thus, the number and length of shared
DNA segments between two individuals can be used to predict
their relatedness. This pair-wise matching algorithm can be
scaled to query all individuals in a large genetic database to
ﬁnd all potential relatives for a given individual and is reliable
for relatives as distant as 3rd cousins [22].
The growing size of genetic genealogy databases has chal-
lenged assumptions about the inherent anonymity of genetic
data because relative matching can be used to re-identify
anonymous DNA samples. The largest and most prominent
of these third-party services is GEDmatch, which maintains a
database with over 1 million GDFs [32]. In April 2018, it was
revealed that analysis on GEDmatch played a crucial role in
identifying the suspected Golden State Killer [7], [15]. Since
then, private companies, like Parabon Nanolabs, have created
“genetic genealogy” units to identify potential suspects using
GEDmatch; over 25 cold cases have been solved with relative
matching on GEDmatch [19]. However, there are no technical
restrictions preventing anyone from applying these same re-
identiﬁcation techniques to other genetic data or samples,
including anonymous research subject data [3], [14]. Current
estimates predict that a genetic genealogy database containing
2% of a target population will produce a 3rd cousin or closer
relative for over 99% of individuals, the same relative degree
used to identify the Golden State Killer [14].
To summarize, open-access genetic genealogy services
contain large amounts of privacy sensitive genetic data, can
be effectively used to identify the source of genetic samples,
have been used extensively by law enforcement, and may soon
be large enough to identify individuals from entire countries.
Therefore,

practices of major genetic genealogy services.

A. Motivation
Open-access genetic genealogy services offer a rich set
of analyses and have complex APIs. Most importantly, the
genetic genealogy API allows users to upload and compare
GDFs to other users in the genetic database to ﬁnd relatives.
In some services the API gives the user a high degree of
ﬂexibility to query speciﬁc GDFs. Ideally, a query would not
reveal unintended information about the state of the database.
However, we hypothesize that a feature rich API, like the
one supported by GEDmatch, will be challenging to secure.
Speciﬁcally, we suspect that such services may be vulnerable
to maliciously crafted queries that leak private information or
data uploads that poison the genetic database.
Here, we do a focused security analysis of the GEDmatch
API to better understand how security threats might manifest
in the genetic genealogy ecosystem. We ﬁnd that GEDmatch
has signiﬁcant privacy and data integrity issues that compound
existing identity inference concerns. These results highlight the
tension between the feature richness of a genetic genealogy
service and the potential for security and privacy issues.1
B. Overview
In this paper, we explore the possibility of attacks against
GEDmatch from an adversary that only uses the standard
API (i.e., uploads normally formatted GDFs and runs standard
queries). We make the following contributions:
•
•
•
•
In Section III we threat model an open-access genetic
genealogy API using the design of GEDmatch as a
guide. We discuss what types of attacks are possible
and how certain design choices can contribute to
security risks.
In Sections VI and VII we show how the results
returned from GDF comparisons (i.e., genetic coor-
dinates and visualizations) can be used by adversaries
to extract raw genetic markers of any targeted user
in the GEDmatch database. This attack is sufﬁciently
powerful that it could be used to steal large portions
of the genetic database.
In Section VIII, we discuss how an adversary might
poison the genetic database with spoofed or falsiﬁed
GDFs to create spurious relationships. We then show
how these GDFs can be easily constructed and up-
loaded to GEDmatch.
In Section IX, we discuss possible mitigations to these
security issues and other recommendations for the
genetic genealogy industry.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section we present background information on DTC
genetic testing and relative matching. We then survey related
work on genetic identity inference and genome privacy.
A. Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing
DTC genetic testing is marketed directly to consumers
without going through an intermediary,
like a healthcare
provider. The most popular type of test uses dense genotyping
arrays that probe between 0.5-1 million genetic markers. DTC
testing kits are inexpensive (< $100 USD) and are mailed to
customers to be returned with a DNA sample (usually saliva).

Fig. 1. An example DTC generated GDF. Each line corresponds to a single
SNP and includes a SNP identiﬁer, chromosome number, base position within
the chromosome, and the genotype of the SNP.
Customers use the DTC genetic tests to get information on
their genetic ancestry, genealogy, and health. Users can also
download ﬁles from DTC companies, called genetic data ﬁles
(GDFs), that contain their raw genetic results.
GDFs contain an individual’s genetic information at spe-
ciﬁc one-base-long positions in the human genome, which are
known to vary within the human population. These positions
are referred to as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
The possible DNA bases found in the human population at
a particular SNP are known as alleles, and the speciﬁc bases
a person has at a SNP constitutes that individual’s genotype.
The genotype of each SNP in the GDF contains two DNA
bases because chromosomes come in pairs (one from each
parent). GDFs are encoded in a simple ASCII format, with
each SNP recorded on a separate line (see Figure 1). The
SNPs are ﬁrst sorted by chromosome and then by position
within each chromosome.
Since the rise of DTC testing, customers have wanted
to interpret their own genetic data using additional online
third-party services. To upload data to third-party services,
customers usually download their GDF from the DTC testing
company and then upload it to the third-party website. In some
cases, third-party services also support ﬁle transfers via APIs
or uploads with less common ﬁle formats (e.g., VCF).
B. Relative Matching
Relative matching algorithms rely on the fact that more
closely related individuals tend to share more of their DNA
and that the degree of relationship can be predicted by the
amount of DNA sharing (e.g., siblings share more DNA than
ﬁrst cousins, and ﬁrst cousins share more DNA than second
cousins). At a high level, relative matching algorithms attempt
to identify large DNA segments that are the same between two
individuals, called matching segments. Closer related individu-
als will, on average, share longer and more numerous matching
DNA segments. SNP-based GDFs can be used to locate these
matching segments because they contain the genotype of an
individual at positions throughout the genome.
Except for close relatives, like siblings, or when individuals
descend from a small number of people,
is typical for
each matching segment to be shared on only one of the two
chromosomes in a pair. This is because one chromosome
comes from the mother and the other from the father, and
most people are related through one branch of their family.
When a DNA segment matches on only one chromosome, it
is called a half-match and on both a full-match.

C. Identity Inference of Genetic Data
Genetic genealogy services are designed to ﬁnd relatives
from genetic data. If the genetic data is from an unknown
source, then any relatives identiﬁed via relative matching can
be combined with genealogy information, like family trees, to
identify the source (person) of the genetic data. This approach
is known as identity inference or identity tracing and is used by
law enforcement to identify suspected criminals from unknown
DNA samples [13], [14], [19].
To perform identity inference the genetic genealogist must
have or be able to construct GDFs for an unknown target
individual and have access to genealogy information to con-
struct family trees. The genealogist then queries the third-party
service with the DTC proﬁle to ﬁnd the target’s relatives and
uses the genealogical information to determine the identity of
the target.
Recent work has demonstrated that anonymous genetic data
in public datasets can be de-identiﬁed using GEDmatch [14].
The ability to de-identify DNA data using third-party services
largely depends on the number of individuals — and, in partic-
ular, the number of relatives — already in the genetic database:
identiﬁcation is easier with more matches. Using a database
that includes 1.28 million individuals, researchers estimated
that 60% of all individuals would be able to identify a third
cousin or closer, the same level of relationship that was used
in the Golden State Killer case; a database covering just 2% of
the population would sufﬁce to ﬁnd a third cousin for nearly
every person [14], [25].
D. Genome Privacy
To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst
to experimentally
explore the speciﬁc attacks surfaced and studied in this paper.
However, there is extensive literature in the computer security
community on privacy, security, and genomics, which we
survey here. Early studies at the intersection of these domains
focused on privacy-respecting methods for processing genetic
data [4], [24], [36]. The ﬁeld has continued to expand, as
captured by surveys such as Akg¨un, et al. [2], Mittos, Malin,
and De Cristofaro [30], and Naveed, et al. [31]. The surveyed
