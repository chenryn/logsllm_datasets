This has the drawback that the tag has to toggle the transistor many times to transmit one bit of information, and this leads to at least an order of magnitude reduction in power efficiency, although let multiple 
tags transmitting at the same time can improve the spectrum efficiency.

Laissez Faire Backscatter: 
A tag can transmit at any time and any bitrate.
The answer is LF-Backscatter. A tag may start transmission at any time with any bitrate, therefore the term Laissez faire.

By simply connecting these edges we can recover the signal transmitted by each tag. From a power perspective, this is fantastic since each node can use the minimal rate to operate at its lowest power point. From a 
spectrum utilization perspective, this is great since we are interleaving transmissions and using the spectrum more efficiently. But the question is whether this picture is realistic.

Active radios

Channel Filter
In typical active radio communication, this would not be possible since a sharp edge occupies a wide spectrum, which would lead to interference across channels. So, active radios use ﬁlters to smooth the edge and 
limit the bandwidth, which reduces the sharpness of the signal edges. The fact that we have sharp edges means that they should be easier to detect at the reader.

However, tags at different locations can have different signal strength, affecting the capacitor’s charging speed. In addition to that, there are about 20% variation in terms of capacitance when manufacturing the 
capacitors. All these factors will result in different charging curves which result in different start time. As a result, the edges are naturally staggered.

Why is this the case? Let’s look at the IQ signal plot when the tag is transmitting 1s.  Firstly we will have a strong background signal due to self-interference and environment reﬂection. Also, we have the signal 
transmitted by the tag, as shown in blue. The received signal is a combination of both.
