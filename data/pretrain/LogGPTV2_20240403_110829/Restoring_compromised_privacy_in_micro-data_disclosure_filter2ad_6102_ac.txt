like t-Closeness ([23]). However, in this paper, we limit our
discussions to the γ-Private only.
Claim 2. The problem of whether a micro-disclosure ∆ =
(publicT, {(V1, ψ1), . . . , (Vn, ψn)}) is γ-Private is decidable.
Proof. Note that because of the two properties of gen-
eralized disclosures we previously discussed, the P IS with
respect to ∆ is ﬁnite. Claim 2 is then straightforward be-
cause we can verify the property of γ-Privacy through enu-
meration, i.e., ∀id, s,

Claim 3. The problem of whether a micro-disclosure ∆ =
Note that the set {T|T ∈ P IS, (id, s) ∈ πID,SA(T )} in (1)
can be also regarded as a possible instance set P IS(cid:48) with
respect to a new micro-disclosure including ∆ and the fact
that id is associated with s. Recall the medical information
example discussed in Section 1. Besides the Public Knowl-
edge disclosure, Table 2, if we have two generalized disclo-
sures (Table 3(A) and Table 3(B)), the corresponding P IS1
will have 45 tables, among which there are 36 tables con-
taining the relation (Donald, SARS); if we have four gener-
alized disclosures (Table 3(A,B) and Table 5(A,B)), the cor-
responding P IS2 has only 8 tables, among which there are 4
tables containing the relation (Donald, SARS). Therefore,
P IS2 is a 0.5-Private, while P IS1 is not. Claim 2 guaran-
tees the computability of the decision problem to check the
proposed γ-Private property. However, in practice, it is not
always feasible to achieve this goal through enumeration.
(publicT, {(V1, ψ1), . . . , (Vn, ψn)}) is γ-Private is #P-complete.
Proof Sketch. We prove this by showing that it is #P-
complete to compute |P IS| with respect to ∆. This is true
because any polynomial algorithm to verify γ-Privacy will
lead to a polynomial algorithm to compute |P IS| and γ-
Privacy can be certainly veriﬁed by computing |P IS|. Clearly,
computing |P IS| is #P because whether a given table T
is in P IS can be veriﬁed in polynomial time. To prove
the hardness of computing |P IS|, we show that to compute
|P IS| even in a special case is #P-hard. Let baseT con-

tain four sets of IDs, V I
and |V I

eralized disclosures such that V1 = V2 = V3 = V4 and

Let s1, . . . , sλ(cid:48) be the set of diﬀerent sensitive values. To
compute |P IS|, we have to compute how many diﬀerent as-
signments of n1, . . . , nλ(cid:48) , where ni(1 ≤ i ≤ λ(cid:48)) represents
the number of times that the sensitive value si is associ-
ated with V1. (If ni is ﬁxed, the number of times that the
sensitive value si is associated with V I
4 is also ﬁxed.)
We reduce the problem of computing the number of con-
tingency tables with prescribed row and column sums in
2 × λ(cid:48) case, which is proved to be #P-complete in the work
[9] to our problem.
Consider an arbitrary 2 × λ(cid:48) contingency table counting
problem with variables n1, . . . , nλ(cid:48) , n(cid:48)
λ(cid:48) and the cor-
responding constraints: Σλ(cid:48)
i = a2, and
ni + n(cid:48)
2 | = a2, appear(si) = bi(1 ≤ i ≤ λ(cid:48)),
where appear(si) is the number of appearance of si in V1.
It is clear that to compute the number of diﬀerent contin-
gency tables, it is equivalent to compute the number of dif-
ferent assignment of n1, . . . , nλ(cid:48)
in our problem of Mirco-
Disclosure.

ciently, in a given micro-data disclosure problem with mul-
tiple generalized disclosures and a large original table, we
need to seek an alternative approach.
3. RELAXED γ-PRIVACY AND ITS VERI-
FICATION BY MONTE CARLO SIMU-
LATION
In this section, we discuss a stochastic approach to verify
the proposed privacy property. By Claim 2, we show that,
in order to verify whether a given P IS is γ-Private, we have
to compute the left side of inequality (1). We denote it by
p(id ∼ s):
p(id ∼ s) =
|{T|T ∈ P IS, (id, s) ∈ πID,SA(T )}|
|P IS|
Instead of computing p(id ∼ s) through an enumeration
process, we can estimate it with a pre-deﬁned statistical con-
ﬁdence, using a Monte Carlo simulation. More formally, let
T1, . . . , TN be N tables that are randomly sampled from the
given P IS, we investigate the statistical properties of the
sample mean ¯p(id ∼ s), to approach the population mean
p(id ∼ s):
¯p(id ∼ s) =

where f (T ) is deﬁned as:
(cid:189)
f (T ) =
(id, s) ∈ πID,SA(T );
otherwise.
1,
0,
Correspondingly, we deﬁne a new stochastic version of the
γ-Private property as follows, based on the fact that the
distribution of ¯p(id ∼ s) will approximate a normal distri-
bution with a large number N . (Note that, we have that
0 ≤ ¯p(id ∼ s) ≤ 1, which requires γ should not be close to
either 0 or 1.)
Deﬁnition 3. Given a micro-disclosure ∆ = (publicT,{(V1,
ψ1), . . . , (Vn, ψn)}), two constants  and θ, where 0  γ with statistical
conﬁdence greater than or equal to θ, AND
• there exist id and s, we have γ −  ≤ p(id ∼ s) ≤ γ + 
with statistical conﬁdence less than θ.
Note that by the second condition of Deﬁnition 3, if p(id ∼
s) is close enough to the security bound γ (within ), a satis-
faction of the privacy property will be granted. The reason
for having this major diﬀerence from Deﬁnition 2 is that if
p(id ∼ s) = γ, we will meet the problem of endless sampling
when checking only the ﬁrst condition. By Deﬁnition 3, we
can immediately obtain the following:
Claim 4. Given a micro-disclosure ∆ and the value of
unbiased estimator ¯p(id ∼ s) of p(id ∼ s), if for any id, s
in ∆, there exist γ1, γ2(γ2 − γ1  1 and f (Ti) values either 0
or 1. Therefore, we have:

Claim 4 completes this proof.
Note that Claim 6 shows that a constant number of sam-
plings is enough to verify the satisfaction of the proposed
privacy property by a given micro-disclosure. However, we
have to be aware of the computational complexity of the
sampling process itself. Clearly, we cannot construct en-
tirely a constructing tree of the P IS with respect to the
micro-disclosure, because the number of nodes of construct-
ing tree can be exponential to λ, the size of baseT . Next, we
discuss how to execute Algorithm 1 eﬃciently, more speciﬁ-
cally, in O((λλ(cid:48))4) time, through a constructing tree T with-
out actually constructing it.
The Sampling Process
How to eﬃciently sample a possible solution to a combinato-
rial problem where exact counting is #P-hard has been well
studied (e.g., [7, 9]). The work [9] shows how to uniformly
sample a contingency table. In this section, we show that
the sampling can be done eﬃciently in our problem.
First, we introduce some preliminary notations. Given a
micro-disclosure ∆ = (publicT,{(V1, ψ1), . . . , (Vn, ψn)}), we
call the following linear equation system with constraints the
solver of ∆, denoted by SOL(∆).
Let s1, . . . , sλ(cid:48) be the complete list of diﬀerent sensitive
values appearing in ∆, and naively, λ(cid:48) ≤ λ. Let id1, . . . , idλ
be the complete list of ID values appearing in ∆. Let X λλ(cid:48)
=
{xi,j}, (1 ≤ i ≤ λ, 1 ≤ j ≤ λ(cid:48)) be the variable representing
whether an ID value is associated with a sensitive value,
i.e., xi,j = 1 means that idi is associated with sj and xi,j =
0 otherwise. Therefore, any possible instance table in the
P IS with respect to ∆ can be represented by a diﬀerent
assignment of X λλ(cid:48)
(an assignment can be regarded as a
vector of size λλ(cid:48)). The SOL(∆) includes the following two
kinds of equations, based on the requirements of the given
