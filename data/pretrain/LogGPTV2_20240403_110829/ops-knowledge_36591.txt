Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of an instance being spawned. It begins with the instance having a pending task (spawning) and then a request is made to the server for details. The image is then checked and active base files are identified. Another request is made to the server for details and the compute resources for the node are audited. An event is created for the instance and the instance is spawned successfully. It took 20.47 seconds to spawn the instance and the process is completed with the instance having a pending task (spawning).
