**ATT&CK ID:** T1584.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Compromise of Third-Party DNS Server

**Description:**
Adversaries may compromise third-party Domain Name System (DNS) servers to support their operations during both the targeting and post-compromise phases. During the targeting phase, adversaries can use these compromised DNS servers to facilitate various malicious activities. In the post-compromise phase, they may leverage DNS traffic for a range of tasks, such as Command and Control (C2) communications, often by employing application layer protocols.

Instead of setting up their own DNS infrastructure, adversaries may opt to compromise existing third-party DNS servers. This approach can provide them with a more covert and efficient means of conducting their operations, as it leverages legitimate infrastructure that is less likely to raise suspicion.
