User: With dulwich I can stage a file using repo.stage, but how do I remove a file ?
I am looking for the equivalent of git rm
Assistant: You can "stage" a file that no longer exists, which will remove it. Alternatively, there is also a dulwich.porcelain.remove function that provides the equivalent of git rm (i.e. removes the file if it exists and then unversions it).
