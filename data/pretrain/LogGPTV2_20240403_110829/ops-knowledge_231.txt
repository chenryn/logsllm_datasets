User: I have a python script that I'd like to add to cron.
The script has +x permission on it.
How shall I add it to crontab? (say, I want it to run every minute).
Important: when I navigate (using the shell) to the script's folder, I cannot run it using "./script_name.py"; it doesn't work. Yet, when I run it using "Python script_name.py", everything works.
Assistant: From cron you should be running the script as script_name.py and your script meets the following criteria:

Executable bit is set
The script's hash-bang is set correctly eg. #!/usr/bin/env python
it is accessible from the PATH

e.g. place it in /usr/local/bin/ or /opt/local/bin/ (and they are accessible to your system PATH.)


If these conditions are met, you should be able to run it from anywhere on your local system as script_name.py
