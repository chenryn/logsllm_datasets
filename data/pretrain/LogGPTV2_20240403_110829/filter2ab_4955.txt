titleblackhat:asia-21 Anti-Forensics: Reverse Engineering a Leading Phone Forensic Tool
How can vulnerabilities in forensic software affect cases brought to the courts? That question was the impetus of what kicked off my research on the Cellebrite UFED - a widely-used phone forensic tool. This talk will cover what my reverse engineering process was, what I found, how I went about reporting my findings, and the concerns, hopes, and fears I  had along the way. One would think that forensic tools like these are only available under strict non-disclosure agreements and to legitimate buyers. But, that didn't stop me from being able to legally obtain several of these devices. I rooted them and reverse engineered the cryptographic implementation protecting their forensic tools and exploits using public and custom-developed tools. I'll talk about their use of hard-coded authentication keys and what the possible implications of my findings were and how they've been addressed. I'll also cover not just how these forensic tools can help law enforcement, but how they can hurt everyone else in the process and how you may be able to defend yourself from them. Join me for a demonstration where my proof-of-concept Android application is able to detect and defeat *some* of the extraction options from the Cellebrite UFED.
