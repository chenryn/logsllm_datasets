Key Terms

Introduction To Key Terms
IPC or Inter-Process Communication 
• An operating system mechanism that allows processes and applications to 
manage shared data and communicate
• Categorized as clients and servers, where the client requests data and the 
server responds to client requests
• Many applications are both clients and servers, as commonly seen in 
distributed computing
6
Introduction To Key Terms
Windows Named Pipes 
• One of the methods to perform IPC in Microsoft Windows
• One-way or duplex pipe for communication between the pipe server and 
one or more pipe clients
• Utilizes a unique file system called NPFS(Named Pipe Filesystem)
• Any process can access named pipes, subject to security checks
• All instances of a named pipe share the same pipe name, 
but each instance has its own buffers and handles
7
Introduction To Key Terms
Windows Named Pipes 
Many configurations and variations:
• Half Duplex or Full Duplex.
• Byte-Oriented or Packet-Oriented.
• Local or Network.
Named pipes network communication is not encrypted 
and uses the protocols SMB (port 445) or DCE\RPC (port 135)
Inter-process communication
is not only local!
8
Introduction To Key Terms
RPC or Remote Procedure Call
• A protocol that allows one program to invoke a service from a program 
located on another computer
• No need to understand the network's structure\details 
• Uses port 135 TCP or UDP
DCE/RPC or Distributed Computing Environment / Remote Procedure Calls
• A facility for calling a procedure on a remote machine as if it were a local 
procedure call
• To the programmer, a remote call looks like a local call
9
Introduction To Key Terms
SMB or Server Message Block
• An application-layer network protocol providing shared 
access to files, printers, serial ports etc.
• Mostly used for file sharing
\\192.168.1.1\c$\Users\manager\Documents
\\fileserver\public\shareddocs
• Also provides an authenticated inter-process 
communication mechanism
• Uses port number 445 TCP
SMB in a nutshell
10
Introduction To Key Terms
Named and Unnamed \ anonymous Pipes 
Two types of named pipes:
• Named pipes: has a specific name, all instances share the name
• Unnamed \ anonymous pipe: is not given a name
o Only used for communication between a child and it’s parent process
o Always local; they cannot be used for communication over a network
o Vanishes as soon as it is closed, or one of the process (parent or child) 
completes execution
o Actually named pipes with a random name
11
Connecting To 
A Named Pipe
12
Connecting To A Named Pipe
• All pipes placed in the root directory of NPFS
• Cannot be mounted within the normal filesystem
• Mounted under the special path - \\.\pipe\{pipe name}
o A pipe named "foo" would have a full path name of: 
\\.\pipe\foo
o Remote connection: 
\\10.0.0.1\pipe\foo
• Can be connected to programmatically or with dedicated tools
13
Connecting To A Named Pipe
IO Ninja
• Named pipes (and other 
communications) Swiss 
army knife

14
Connecting To A Named Pipe
• This is how it looks in Wireshark (SMB communication)
15
Pipe ACLs And 
Connection 
Limitation
16
Pipe ACLs And Connection Limitation
• Named pipes are implemented by a filesystem driver in Windows NT, npfs.sys, 
which supports security descriptors
• Security descriptors are used to control access to named pipes.
• By default DACL (Discretionary Access Control Lists) permissions are set to 
everyone using anonymous login (null sessions). 
• Other named pipes allow access to authenticated domain users (lots of users)
• ACLs can be modified to allow only specific users (same as file ACLs)
17
Named Pipes have Access Control Lists.
For the following pipe it is permitted to everyone to connect:

Conficker case study
• Conficker is a computer worm targeting the Microsoft Windows operating 
system that was first detected in November 2008.
• It uses flaws in Windows OS software and dictionary attacks on administrator 
passwords to propagate while forming a botnet.
• It has been unusually difficult to counter because of its combined use of 
many advanced malware techniques.
• It infected millions of computers including government, 
business and home computers in over 190 countries (!).
21
Conficker case study
22
Conficker case study
• Variant C creates a named pipe, over which it can push URLs for 
downloadable payloads to other infected hosts on a local area network.
• Named pipes can be used for C&C purposes!
• Used in other Trojans as well: Moker, ZxShell and even Petya uses it to 
transfer extracted passwords.
23
Enumerating 
And Scanning 
For Named 
Pipes
24
Named pipes can be enumerated using different testing tools.
For locally detecting which named pipes are opened, it is possible to use Sysinternals’ pipelist:

Fuzzing
Named Pipes
31
Fuzzing
• Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that 
involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a 
computer program. 
• Done with fuzzers – automatic fuzzing tools
• The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes and potential 
RCEs. 
• Typically, fuzzers are used to test unmanaged (C\C++) programs that take 
structured inputs. 
32
Fuzzing
Two types of fuzzing approaches: 
Dumb (“Black Box”)
• Go over all possible inputs without understanding the expected ones 
(sometimes implemented using random data)
• Simple to implement, sometimes impossible to execute using the sequential 
approach
Smart (“White Box”)
• Understand the expected input and fuzz along the edges 
(mix expected data template with random values) 
– Smart data generation
• Harder to implement, more code coverage

Exploitation
And Impact 
35
Exploitation And Impact
• Many pieces of software work with hidden and\or undocumented APIs
• The forgotten nature of named pipes leave an uncharted territory of 
socket-like interfaces that can contain vulnerabilities
• Named pipes fall in between App PT and Infra PT. 
o App pentesters usually connects to typical app ports, RPC and SMB 
not included.
o When Infra pentesters encounter RPC\SMB they try to gain credentials, 
not check for named pipes.
o EDR experts don’t take special notice to remote connections.
• If software reads data from the named pipe without validation,
the attacker might trigger Buffer Overflow leading to Denial of 
Service of the software and even Remote Code Execution.
36
Exploitation And Impact
• If named pipe ACLs allow remote access, remote DoS or RCE can be 
triggered
• Research of the cause behind the crash will allow the attacker to facilitate it as 
a zero day vulnerability
• Could be used to spread a malware in an internal network, as recently seen in 
the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya malware campaigns
GAME OVER
37
Case study:
Viber,
qBittorrent, 
SugarSync
38
Viber, qBittorrent & SugarSync case study
Viber
• Cellular & endpoint social communication
• Free calls, text and picture sharing with anyone
• Competitors of WhatsApp
• 800 million users worldwide
39
Viber, qBittorrent & SugarSync case study
qBittorrent
• a cross-platform client for the BitTorrent protocol
• Free and open-source, released under the GPLv2
• Written in C++
SugarSync
• A cloud service that enables active synchronization of files across 
computers and other devices 
• Used for file backup, access, syncing, and sharing 
• Supports variety of operating systems, such as Android, iOS, Mac OS X, 
and Windows devices
40
Exploitation And Impact
The applications use the widely used QT framework:
• A cross-platform application development framework for desktop, embedded 
and mobile. Supports multiple platforms and operating systems
• The applications use the qtsingleapp functionality which is responsible for 
writing temp files, probably to make sure the application runs a single instance.
• By fuzzing the named pipe both locally and remotely, we managed to 
remotely crash the programs and in Qbitorrent, also
a execute a remote command injection attack

Mitigation
And Defense
43
Mitigation And Defense
Developers point of view
Know the risk!
• When creating a named pipe, set a secured ACL to allow only authorized 
connections to the named pipes
• Follow the least privilege approach
o Giving a user account only those privileges which are essential to 
perform its intended function
• If possible, limit the maximum number of instances of a named pipe, thus 
effectively limiting the number of simultaneous connections
44
Mitigation And Defense
Users\3rd party software clients point of view
Know the risk!
• Block all unnecessary SMB and RPC services (ports 135 and 445), 
especially over WAN/Internet
• Segment the network according to security best practices
• Always install the latest software security patches
45
Mitigation And Defense
Hackers’ point of view
Know the opportunity!
• Well… Hack
• Explore remotely accessible named pipes and test for RCE and DoS 
whenever seeing open SMB or RPC ports
• Have fun! 
46
Closing remarks
•
Windows named pipes are a forgotten, remotely accessible, 
socket-like interface
•
A whole, newly rediscovered, potential world of local and remote 
vulnerabilities – increased attack surface
•
Don’t ignore named pipes in Windows desktop applications
Stay safe
