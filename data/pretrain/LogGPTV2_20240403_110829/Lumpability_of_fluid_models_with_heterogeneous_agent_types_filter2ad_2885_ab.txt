The aggregated variables y obey the ODE system
˙y1 = − min(y1, y3)α1 + α2 b y2 + α3(1 − b)y2,
˙y2 = min(y1, y3)α1 − α2 b y2 − α3(1 − b)y2,
˙y3 = − min(y1, y3)α1 + α4y4,
˙y4 = min(y1, y3)α1 − α4y4.

Using Theorem 1, we can infer that the lumping is exact if
and only if
M f ( ¯M M x) = M f (x),
for all x.
The above condition is satisﬁed if and only if α2 = α3. In
other words, the system (5) is exactly lumpable by M to the
system (8) if and only if α2 = α3.
Remark 1. By making use of Theorem 3, one could have come
to the conclusion that a necessary condition for the lumping to
be exact is that the right-hand side of (8) be independent from
the particular choice of ¯M (i.e., from a and b, which holds if
and only if α2 = α3).
Importantly, we notice that exact lumpability is indepen-
dent from the initial conditions of the ODE system. This is
in contrast to the approach in [28], whose framework can
be shown to cover the model in (5). This is because the
notion of lumpability in [28] essentially requires that the initial
conditions be the same for all ODE variables to be aggregated,
i.e., x1(0) = x3(0) and x2(0) = x4(0). On the other hand, the
deﬁnition of lumping used in this paper does not permit to
fully recover the behavior of the original model in general.
For instance, whilst via (8), with α2 = α3, it is possible to
conclude that y1(t) = x1(t) + x3(t), the additional constraints
on the initial conditions yield that x1(t) = x3(t), hence
x1(t) = x3(t) = y1(t)/2.
As a side note, the relationship between these two lumping
schemes is reminiscent of the difference between exact and
ordinary lumpability for Markov chains [4]. Whilst with the
former the probability of being in each state of the original
system can be recovered if all states belonging to a partition
element have the same initial probability, the latter only gives
the exact sum of the probabilities of such states.
III.
ε-LUMPABILITY
As it emerges from the above example, the parameters of
the model play an important role in inferring the existence of
an exact lumping. In light of this, we shall often write the
ODE system as
˙x(t) = f (x(t), α).
(9)
The vector ﬁeld is deﬁned as f : E × F → Rn, with E ⊆ Rn
and F ⊆ Rm. The latter represents the parameter domain,
whose elements will be denoted by α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm). The
vector ﬁeld f is also assumed to be Lipschitz continuous with
respect to the parameters with constant K, uniformly on x. In
the sequel, we shall interchangeably use the notations f (x, α)
and f (x), with a preference towards the former whenever an
explicit dependence on the parameters ought to be stressed.
In the previous section, we have been concerned with the
problem of inferring whether a given transformation matrix
can exactly lump the solution of an ODE system to that of
a system with fewer equations. We have seen that necessary
and sufﬁcient conditions exist which help us provide an
answer to the above query. In this section, we deal with a
related, although different, question. Namely, given a certain
aggregation matrix which does not fulﬁll the necessary and
sufﬁcient conditions, is it possible to say how the solution of
the aggregated system relates to the original system solution?
In its full generality, the answer to this question is difﬁcult.
However, we shall see that, if we restrict ourselves to certain
class of systems, it is possible to infer that the solution of the
lumped system is, in a certain sense, close to the solution of
the original system.
Let x(t) be the solution of ˙x(t) = f (x(t)), as in (1) and
M ∈ Rˆn×n (ˆn ≤ n) be an aggregating matrix. Let y(t) be a

solution of the system ˙y(t) = ˆf (y(t)) with ˆf = M f ◦ ¯M and
initial conditions y(0) = M x(0). In order to estimate how
far the solution y(t) is from the aggregated behavior of the
original system, i.e., M x(t), we deﬁne the lumping error as
e(t) := y(t) − M x(t) .
(10)
We can derive a system of differential equations for the
lumping error, that is
(cid:26) ˙e(t) = M f ( ¯M y(t)) − M f (x(t))
e(0) = y(0) − M x(0) = 0
(11)
To obtain a bound on the lumping error, there are two main
hurdles that one faces. The ﬁrst is that, often, the solution of
the original system is difﬁcult to obtain due its dimensionality,
which prevents us from working directly on its deﬁnition (10).
Secondly, to solve the system of differential equations (11) for
arbitrary f does not seem to be a trivial task to perform, also
due to its dependence on the original solution.
However, we ﬁnd that the following class of vector ﬁelds
satisﬁes certain properties that are suitable for providing an
a-priori bound on the lumping error. As discussed, we shall
also provide evidence that such a class is not too restrictive by
considering examples of ﬂuid models already available in the
literature that belong to this class.
Deﬁnition 2. Let M ∈ Rˆn×n, with ˆn ≤ n, be a matrix, ¯M a
generalized right inverse of M, and a function f : Rn×Rm →
Rn. The triple (M, ¯M , f ) is said to be ε-lumpable if there
exists ε ∈ Rm such that
M f(cid:0) ¯M M x, α(cid:1) = M f (x, α + ε),
for all x.
(12)
Remark 2. If (M, ¯M , f ) is ε-lumpable with ε = 0 then the
system ˙x = f (x, α) is exactly lumpable by M to ˙y = ˆf (y, α),
with ˆf = M f ◦ ¯M.
Informally, Deﬁnition 2 requires that the error induced by
the aggregation matrix M acting on the system f can be
absorbed in the parameters. In other words, heterogeneous
components can be made homogeneous at
the price of a
suitable perturbation of the parameters. As we shall see more
clearly with the case studies, the ε-lumpability condition im-
plicitly guarantees the existence of a class of systems that are
exactly lumpable by the matrix M. Every element of the class
corresponds to a perturbation (in the parameters) of the original
system, which depends on the choice of the generalized inverse
matrix ¯M. Further, we remark that ε-lumpability depends on
the matrix M. That is, for a given original system under
consideration which is ε-lumpable by M, there may be another
aggregation matrix M(cid:48) which does not satisfy (12).
Next, we show how ε-lumpability can be exploited to infer
that the error incurred by an approximate aggregation is at
worst linear with (cid:107)ε(cid:107). To do so, from (11) we can write
(cid:107) ˙e(t)(cid:107) = (cid:107)M f ( ¯M y(t)) − M f (x(t))(cid:107)
≤ (cid:107)M f ( ¯M y(t)) − M f ( ¯M M x(t))(cid:107)
+ (cid:107)M f ( ¯M M x(t)) − M f (x(t))(cid:107) .
We proceed by separately bounding the two norms appearing
on the right-hand side of the above inequality. On the ﬁrst
term, the Lipschitz continuity with respect to the variable x
yields
(cid:107)M f ( ¯M y(t)) − M f ( ¯M M x(t))(cid:107)
≤ L(cid:107)M(cid:107)(cid:107) ¯M y(t) − ¯M M x(t)(cid:107) = L(cid:107)M(cid:107)(cid:107) ¯M(cid:107)(cid:107)e(t)(cid:107) .
As regards the second term, we use the ε-lumpability
i.e. M f ( ¯M M x, α) = M f (x, α + ε) for every
condition,
x, together with the Lipschitz continuity with respect to the
parameters, which provide us with the following bound
(cid:107)M f ( ¯M M x(t), α) − M f (x(t), α)(cid:107)
= (cid:107)M f (x(t), α + ε) − M f (x(t), α)(cid:107) ≤ K(cid:107)M(cid:107)(cid:107)ε(cid:107) .
As a result of the above, we obtain the inequality
(cid:107) ˙e(t)(cid:107) ≤ β(cid:107)e(t)(cid:107) + γ(ε) ,
(13)
with β = L(cid:107)M(cid:107)(cid:107) ¯M(cid:107) and γ(ε) = K(cid:107)M(cid:107)(cid:107)ε(cid:107). We present
below a standard result which helps deriving from (13) a
differential inequality for the norm of the lumping error. Such
a result permits to relate the right derivative of the norm of
the lumping error and the norm of its derivative.
Lemma 1. Let x : [a, b] → Rn be a continuously differentiable
function, then (cid:107)x(t)(cid:107) has right derivative
DR(cid:107)x(t)(cid:107) (cid:44) lim
h→0+
such that
(cid:107)x(t + h)(cid:107) − (cid:107)x(t)(cid:107)
,
h
DR(cid:107)x(t)(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107) ˙x(t)(cid:107) .
(14)
Proof: The ﬁrst thing to be shown is that the above-
mentioned limit exists. Let (cid:107)·(cid:107) denote a norm in Rn and
a, b ∈ Rn and t > 0, we deﬁne q(t) (cid:44) (cid:107)a+tb(cid:107)−(cid:107)a(cid:107)
. The
function q(t) satisﬁes the following properties
i) q(t) ≥ −(cid:107)b(cid:107)
ii) q(t) is non decreasing, i.e., for any t1, t2 such that t2 ≥
t
t1 > 0 implies q(t2) ≥ q(t1).
t2 (cid:107)a + t1b(cid:107) = (cid:107)at2 + t1t2b(cid:107)
= (cid:107)t1(a + t2b) + (t2 − t1)a(cid:107)
≤ t1 (cid:107)a + t2b(cid:107) + (t2 − t1)(cid:107)a(cid:107) ,
which guarantee that the limt→0+ q(t) exists. We now exploit
the continuous differentiability of the function x(t)
|((cid:107)x(t + h)(cid:107) − (cid:107)x(t)(cid:107)) − ((cid:107)x(t) + h ˙x(t)(cid:107) − (cid:107)x(t)(cid:107))|
= |(cid:107)x(t + h)(cid:107) − (cid:107)x(t) + h ˙x(t)(cid:107)|
≤ (cid:107)x(t + h) − x(t) − h ˙x(t)(cid:107) = o(h) ,
as h → 0+. Thus, DR (cid:107)x(t)(cid:107) exists and equals
(cid:107)x(t) + h ˙x(t)(cid:107) − (cid:107)x(t)(cid:107)
lim
h→0+
h
.
The above limit can be bounded by (cid:107) ˙x(t)(cid:107) which concludes
the proof.
Consequently, the norm of the lumping error satisﬁes the
differential inequality
DR (cid:107)e(t)(cid:107) ≤ β (cid:107)e(t)(cid:107) + γ(ε) .

A bound for the solution of the above inequality may be
obtained with the following well-known result.
Lemma 2. Let ν be a continuous scalar function on [0, T ]
which has a right derivative DRν(t) on [0, T ) such that
DRν(t) ≤ βν(t) + γ
for t ∈ [0, T ) and ν(0) = 0. Then, ν(t) ≤ γ
t ∈ [0, T ].

for any t ∈ [0, T ] (in the right-hand side the function has been
evaluated at 0). The claim easily follows.
An application of the above lemma gives the desired result
for the bound of (cid:107)e(t)(cid:107).
