The importance of stronger cyber security requirements in
SCADA systems is highlighted by recent experiences in
Ukraine. On December 23rd 2015, a third party illegally
accessed the computer and Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems of three regional electricity
distribution companies in Ukraine. Investigations revealed
that a malware named BlackEnergy had infected the SCADA
systems after successful spear phishing attacks. Seven 110
kV and twenty-three 35 kV substations were disconnected
for three hours resulting in several outages that caused ap-
proximately 225,000 customers to lose power across various
areas [19]. The following year, on December 17th 2016, a
second power outage occurred in Ukraine and deprived part
of its capital, Kiev, of power for over an hour. An assessment
was made that a more advanced form of malware called “In-
dustroyer”, was used in the second cyber attack against the
power grid in Ukraine [23].
This paper presents a study of the impacts of IoT demand
attacks on power systems using the cascading outage analysis
in a North American Regional Interconnection System.
From the simulation results, we show that, 1% of load
increase attack does not interrupt any generator, load, or trans-
mission line in the system. We also ﬁnd that, thanks to under
frequency load shedding protections, a 10% of sudden IoT
load increase does not cause a cascading failure on the trans-
mission lines.
A “frequency swing attack” is deﬁned as a cycle of load
increase and decrease attacks with the aim to push the fre-
quency outside the safety limits of the generators. However,
the frequency swing attack doesn’t show an ability to cause
an immediate disconnection of generators. We also discussed
a possible repeated frequency swing attack and the potential
impact of depleting the UFLS resources. Our analysis shows
that the effectiveness of such attack would be impacted by

any additional frequency protection measures in the system,
and by the diminishing resources that the adversary would
have to continue the attacks.
We also considered high-impact attacks with control of
30% of the system load. The simulation results show that
under a sudden IoT attack increasing 30% of the system de-
mand, load shedding by UFLS would split the frequencies
of the buses into islands of different operating regions of the
grid. In contrast, a 30% decrease of the load would cause the
frequency of the system to increase above the thresholds for
over-frequency protections, and will result in the disconnec-
tion of some (but not all) generators. Our results show that the
actions of UFLS and over frequency protection are sufﬁcient
to prevent an immediate system failure over a short time after
the attack. Additional actions may be needed over a longer
time scale to restore the stable operation of the system, but
the main point is that a system blackout will likely not occur
in this situation. In addition, we discover that including gen-
erations that are not providing inertia in the over-frequency
protections would beneﬁt the system in case of following IoT
attacks targeted at disturbing the system frequency.
Our results show a different perspective on the risks of IoT
attacks to the power grid and will hopefully serve as a starting
point for new discussions to assess this threat. We show that
while immediate cascading failures or a total system blackout
will be very hard to achieve, the power system will still suffer
negative consequences. First, UFLS will disconnect various
consumers from the power grid. This is done to prevent further
damage to the grid, but several consumers will be affected.
Second, our attacks show that with millions of high-energy
IoT devices, the attacker can potentially cause a bifurcation of
the frequency in the power grid, forcing the grid to operated
as separate islands and driving it to a more vulnerable state.
