### Dynamic Operation of Network Firewalls

Network firewalls may operate dynamically, for example, by observing our probes over time. If the firewall interprets these probes as an attack, it may start blocking them. In such cases, our own measurements could inadvertently trigger filtering, making it challenging to distinguish between reactive filtering of our measurements and on-path filtering between a site and a reflector. The latter can also change over time, further complicating the analysis.

### VIII. Conclusion

Despite the widespread practice of Internet censorship, obtaining comprehensive, continuous measurements from diverse vantage points has been difficult. Most studies of censorship have been limited in both scale (i.e., covering only a few vantage points) and time (i.e., spanning only short periods without baseline measurements). The lack of comprehensive data on Internet censorship stems from the challenge of recruiting vantage points across a wide range of countries, regions, and ISPs. Previous techniques for measuring Internet censorship often required some form of network presence in the monitored network.

In this paper, we address this problem with a fundamentally different approach. Instead of relying on in-country monitoring points that are not directly accessible, we leverage recent advances in TCP/IP side-channel measurement techniques to collect data between pairs of endpoints. This allows us to conduct measurements from "third-party" vantage points that we control, enabling us to monitor many more paths than was previously possible. While previous work introduced the concept of third-party side-channel measurements, we have transitioned this concept into a practical, working system that adheres to ethical norms and produces reliable measurements despite the inevitable artifacts and noise in real-world deployments.

The continuous, widespread measurements we can now collect will complement anecdotes, news reports, and policy briefings, ensuring that future assessments of Internet filtering are backed by sound, comprehensive data. This transition to practice includes further developing the system to facilitate ongoing operation, such as automating the validation of collected measurements. We aim to correlate this data with other datasets related to application-layer [45] and DNS-based [6], [29] filtering.

### VII. Discussion

#### Coverage Limitations

Ethical considerations restrict our measurements to a set of hosts that we can confidently conclude represent Internet infrastructure within the network. We achieve this by measuring the Internet topology and using reflectors at least two traceroute hops into the network. This approach significantly reduces the number of potential reflectors. In the future, more exhaustive techniques to identify Internet infrastructure could increase the set of IP addresses we can use as reflectors.

#### Evasion Mechanisms

Evasion Augur relies on the injection of spoofed SYN-ACK packets. A natural evasion mechanism would be to use a stateful firewall to drop SYN-ACKs that do not correspond to a previously sent SYN. Implementing such firewalls at scale poses significant challenges due to asymmetric routing in large networks, where SYN packets may traverse different paths than SYN-ACKs. Coordinating state across these links is complex, and any errors could result in blocking benign connections, leading to collateral damage.

Alternatively, censors could allow TCP control packets through but disrupt data packets. This approach might complicate the censor's own monitoring efforts, as it contradicts common assumptions made by diagnostic tools. It may also introduce management burdens because it does not align with typical packet filtering practices.

#### Ambiguity in Filtering Location and Granularity

Current measurements only indicate whether packets were filtered somewhere along the end-to-end path between a reflector and a site. This ambiguity makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact location and granularity of the filtering. Future work should aim to improve the precision of these measurements.
