may even operate dynamically: for example, network ﬁrewalls
may observe our probes over time, come to view them as an
attack, and begin to block our probes; in this case, our own
measurements may give rise to ﬁltering, rendering it difﬁcult
to disambiguate reactive ﬁltering of our measurements from
on-path ﬁltering between a site and reﬂector, particularly since
the latter may also change over time.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Despite the pervasive practice of Internet censorship, obtain-
ing widespread, continuous measurements from a diversity of
vantage points has proved elusive; most studies of censorship
to-date have been limited both in scale (i.e., concerning only
a limited number of vantage points) and in time (i.e., covering
only a short time span, with no baseline measurements). The
lack of comprehensive measurements about Internet censor-
ship stems from the difﬁculty of recruiting vantage points
across a wide range of countries, regions, and ISPs, as most
previous techniques for measuring Internet censorship have
required some type of network presence in the network being
monitored.
In this paper, we tackle this problem with a fundamentally
different type of approach: instead of relying on in-country
monitoring points for which we have no direct access, we
exploit recent advances in TCP/IP side-channel measurement
techniques to collect measurements between pairs of endpoints

in site ﬁltering experienced
by reﬂectors within countries. We elide countries without any
disruption.
VII. DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss various aspects concerning the
coverage, granularity, and accuracy of the current measure-
ments.
Coverage limitations. Ethical considerations when perform-
ing our measurements restricted the reﬂectors from which we
measure to a set of hosts that we can conﬁdently conclude
represent Internet infrastructure in the interior of the network.
Recall that we do so by measuring the Internet topology and
only using reﬂectors at least two traceroute hops into the
network. This approach drastically reduces the number of hosts
that we can use as reﬂectors. In the future, more exhaustive
techniques to identify Internet infrastructure could increase the
set of IP addresses that we might use as reﬂectors.
Evasion Augur relies on the injection of spoofed SYN-ACK
packets. A natural evasion mechanism could use a stateful
ﬁrewall
to drop SYN-ACKs that do not correspond to a
previously sent SYN. Implementing such ﬁrewalls at scale
poses signiﬁcant challenges. Large networks frequently have
multiple transit links resulting in asymmetric routing; SYN
packets may traverse a different path than the SYN-ACKs.
The censor would need to coordinate state across these links.
Any errors in state management would lead to blocking benign
connections, resulting in collateral damage.
Alternatively, censors could switch to allowing through TCP
control packets and only disrupting data packets. Such an
approach might complicate the censor’s own monitoring of
their blocking efforts as it runs counter to assumptions com-
monly made by diagnostic tools. Similarly, it may introduce
management burdens because it does not accord with common
forms of packet ﬁltering.
Ambiguity in location and granularity of ﬁltering. The
current measurements only indicate whether packets became
ﬁltered somewhere along the end-to-end path between a re-

that we do not control. This ability to conduct measurements
from “third-party” vantage points that we control allows us to
continuously monitor many more paths than was previously
possible. Previous work introduced the high-level concept of
these third-party side-channel measurements; in this work, we
transition the concept to practice through a working system
that abides by ethical norms and produces sound measure-
ments in the presence of the measurement artifacts and noise
that inevitably manifest in real-world deployments.
The continuous, widespread measurements that we can
collect with these techniques can ultimately complement anec-
dotes, news reports, and policy brieﬁngs to ensure that we
can back future assessments of Internet ﬁltering with sound,
comprehensive data. Part of this transition to practice involves
further developing the system that we have developed to
facilitate ongoing operation,
including automating the val-
idation of the measurements that we collect. We aim to
ultimately correlate this data with other datasets that pertain
to application-layer [45] and DNS-based [6], [29] ﬁltering.
