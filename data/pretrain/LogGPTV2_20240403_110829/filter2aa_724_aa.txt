### Key Points
- **Lateral Movement** is the process of using authentication material to execute code on another host.
- It is common in red team exercises and real-world attacks.
- EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) systems and well-trained SOCs (Security Operations Centers) are making traditional lateral movement techniques more challenging.
- We need to develop new techniques to stay ahead.

## Premise of the Talk
As we explore various techniques, we will classify them using the following metrics:
- **Filesystem Artifacts**
- **Host Artifacts**
- **Network Artifacts**
- **Prevalence - Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**

This simple, intentionally incomplete traffic light system will help us make more informed decisions when choosing a lateral movement technique. Examples:

| Technique                | Filesystem Artifacts   | Host Artifacts       | Network Artifacts | Prevalence - IoC            |
|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Default PsExec           | Uploads a Binary in ADMIN$ | Creates a Service    | Directly Connect  | Well Known - IoC Available  |
| TaskShell - Replacing Action | None - Depends      | Modifies an Existing Task | Directly Connect  | Less Known                  |
| TaskShell - Replacing Binary | Uploads a Binary    | Does not Modify Tasks | Directly Connect  | Less Known                  |

## RPC-Based Execution Methods
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**: A client-server communication mechanism that allows clients to invoke methods on a server.
- **Used Everywhere in Windows**.
- **Resources**: [RPC for Detection Engineers](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/RPC_for_Detection_Engineers.pdf)

### Techniques
- **Task Scheduler**
  - Tasks can be created remotely via RPC.
  - **Classic Method** (Avoided due to high visibility):
    ```shell
    beacon> shell schtasks /CREATE /TN code /TR "C:\Windows\beacon.exe" /RU "SYSTEM" /ST 15:33 /S HOST
    ```
  - **New Approaches**:
    - **Replace a Binary** (e.g., SUNBURST)
    - **Replace the Action**
  - **Tool**: [TaskShell](https://github.com/RiccardoAncarani/TaskShell)
  - **Telemetry**:
    - Task Scheduler Event Log
    - Task Scheduler ETW Sensor
    - Task Scheduler Operational Logs

- **Remote Registry**
  - Programmatically create scheduled tasks without using Task Scheduler's RPC interfaces.
  - Avoid generating Task Scheduler-based Windows events.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    ticketer.py -nthash [NTLM] -domain-sid S-1-5-21-861978250-176888651-3117036350 -domain isengard.local -dc-ip 192.168.182.132 -extra-sid S-1-5-18 -spn HOST/WIN-FCMCCB17G6U.isengard.local WIN-FCMCCB17G6U$
    ```

- **Fax Service**
  - **RegisterServiceProviderEx** allows loading an arbitrary DLL after the Fax service restarts.
  - **Not Installed by Default on Servers**; present on Windows 10 workstations.
  - **Steps**:
    - Check Fax service status.
    - Add relevant registry keys.
    - Start the service and trigger the payload.
  - **Caveats**:
    - Executes as NETWORK SERVICE.
    - The process FXSSVC.exe will die immediately.
  - **Workaround**:
    - Change the user account associated with the FAX service.
    - Use Outlook COM to create and connect to the FaxServer.FaxServer object.

- **NetTcpPortSharing**
  - .NET-based service, disabled by default, runs as a virtual service account.
  - Target binary: `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\SMSvcHost.exe`
  - **Steps**:
    - Drop a DLL in the specified directory.
    - Modify SMSvcHost.exe.config to specify the custom AppDomain Manager.
    - Enable and start the service.
  - **Caveat**:
    - By default, it runs as a virtual service account.
    - Use `ChangeServiceConfig2A` to reconfigure privileges.

| Technique                | Filesystem Artifacts   | Host Artifacts       | Network Artifacts | Prevalence - IoC            |
|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| NetTcpPortSharing        | Uploads a Binary       | Creates New Registry Keys | Directly Connect  | Unknown                     |
| Fax                      | Uploads a Binary       | Creates New Registry Keys | Directly Connect  | Unknown                     |

## DCOM-Based Execution Methods
- **Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)**: Allows the creation of COM objects on network endpoints and invokes methods executed on a remote host.
- **Popular Methods**:
  - ShellBrowser
  - Excel
  - InternetExplorer
  - MMC20

### Control Panel Item
- Further details on DCOM-based execution methods, including the use of control panel items, will be covered in the next section.

By exploring these unconventional techniques, we aim to stay ahead of evolving security measures and continue to improve our lateral movement capabilities.
