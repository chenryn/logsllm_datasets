User: My program has been written on python 3.1 (it was the biggest mistake I've ever made). Now I want to use a few modules that were written on 2.6.
I know that it's possible to specify the interpreter in Unix #!/usr/bin/python2.6. But what if I use Windows? Does any way to specify the interpreter exist in Windows?
Edit: I want to be able to use both interpreters simultaneously.
Assistant: If you go into Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables, and then add Python 2.6 to the PATH variable (it's probably located at C:\Python26 or C:\Program Files\Python26) -- and make sure Python 3.1 isn't in it -- then if you type python at the command prompt, you'll get 2.6 instead. As for Explorer, you'll want to associate it by using the Open With... dialog. Browse to the path (probably C:\Python26\python.exe) and set it. Make sure you check to make it the default before you hit OK.
To add the to PATH variable, you'll have to add a ; on the end of the current PATH variable and then add the folder's path after it (remove 3.1 if needed). For example:
PATH="C:\Program Files\Emacs23\bin;C:\Cygwin\bin;C:\Python31"
would become:
PATH="C:\Program Files\Emacs23\bin;C:\Cygwin\bin;C:\Python26"
