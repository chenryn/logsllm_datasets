## 4.1 T-year Return Value

There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal method for setting the threshold value in the Peak Over Threshold (POT) method. In our study, we utilized the \(a^*\) method [6] to determine the optimal threshold values. Specifically, we set the threshold \(u = 100\) for the in-house system, \(u = 200\) for the LANL HPC system, and \(u = 710\) for the NERSC Seaborg system. We found that the estimated T-year return values were relatively insensitive to the specific threshold values chosen for these three data sets.

### 4.1.1 In-house System

For the in-house system, using the 121 exceedances over the threshold \(u = 100\), the parameters \((\xi, \sigma)\) were estimated as \((0.969, 266.3)\) with a maximized log-likelihood of \(-1341.2\). The 95% confidence intervals for \(\xi\) and \(\sigma\) are \([0.613, 1.32]\) and \([170.7, 361.8]\), respectively. The scaling exponent \(\alpha\) is given by the reciprocal of \(\xi\), i.e., \(\alpha = \xi^{-1}\). Thus, the estimated scaling exponent is \([0.75, 1.63]\) with 95% confidence. The arrival rate \(\lambda\) and the exceedance probability \(\pi_u\) were calculated as \(\lambda = 332 / (333/365) = 364.0\) and \(\pi_u = 121 / 332 = 0.364\).

Substituting these estimators into Equation (9), we obtained the 1-year return value as 31,119.2 and the 1-month return value as 2,640.8. Figure 5(a) shows the time series data along with the 1-year and 1-month return values. During the 333-day observation period, only one incident exceeded the 1-year return value, and ten incidents exceeded the 1-month return value. These values are close to the expected number of exceedances: 333/365 = 0.912 for the 1-year return value and 333/365 × 12 = 10.9 for the 1-month return value. For reference, the 1-week return value is 560.3, with 46 realized exceedances, while the expected value is 333/365 × 12 × 4 = 43.8. The results are summarized in Table 2, showing good agreement between the estimated T-year return values and the actual data across different time scales.

### 4.1.2 LANL HPC System

For the LANL HPC system, the parameters \((\xi, \sigma)\) were estimated as \((0.809, 170.6)\) with a maximized log-likelihood of \(-5331.6\). The 95% confidence intervals for \(\xi\) and \(\sigma\) are \([0.665, 0.953]\) and \([144.9, 196.4]\), respectively. The corresponding confidence interval for the scaling exponent \(\alpha\) is \([1.05, 1.50]\). The arrival rate \(\lambda\) and the exceedance probability \(\pi_u\) were calculated as \(\lambda = 3997 / (1222/365) = 1193.9\) and \(\pi_u = 666 / 3997 = 0.167\).

Using the estimated parameters, the 1-year return value is 15,281.5, and the 1-month return value is 2,036.9. During the 1,222-day observation period, the number of exceedances over the 1-year return value was 3, which is close to the expected value of 1222/365 = 3.34. The number of exceedances over the 1-month return value was 38, compared to the expected value of 40.2. Table 2 again shows that the T-year return values predict the return values accurately across all time scales, from 1 week to 1 year.

### 4.1.3 NERSC Seaborg System

For the NERSC Seaborg system, the parameters \((\xi, \sigma)\) were estimated as \((0.894, 365.7)\) with a maximized log-likelihood of \(-280.6\) using the 29 exceedances. The 95% confidence intervals for \(\xi\) and \(\sigma\) are \([0.309, 1.48]\) and \([145.2, 586.3]\), respectively. The corresponding confidence interval for \(\alpha\) is \([0.68, 3.23]\). The arrival rate \(\lambda\) and the exceedance probability \(\pi_u\) were calculated as \(\lambda = 170 / (1998/365) = 31.0\) and \(\pi_u = 29 / 170 = 0.171\).

The 1-year return value is 2,117.0, and the 1-month return value is 497.0. During the 1,998-day observation period, the number of exceedances over the 1-year return value was 6, which is close to the expected value of 1998/365 = 5.47. The number of exceedances over the 1-week return value was 285.4, while the expected value is 88. This discrepancy is likely due to a bias in the distribution of short repair times, as mentioned in Section 2.1.3.

The good agreement between the estimated T-year return values and the actual data in the three systems suggests that we can effectively predict the worst-case scenarios that may occur during a fixed future period by estimating the T-year return values.

## 4.2 Time Series Data for Sample T-year Return Value

Figure 6 illustrates the time series plot for the sample T-year return value \(X_{T,j}\), calculated using observed samples \(\{X_i : i = 1, \ldots, j\}\). As discussed in Section 3.3, there are cases where the T-year return value is sensitive to the scaling parameter \(\xi\), leading to incorrect estimates. In our study, we filtered out invalid values by checking if the estimated T-year return values exceeded the observed repair time values over T years. In Figure 6, periods without lines indicate the rejection of such misestimated values.
