The GEV family is referred to as the Frechet distribution for

by Gnedenko [13] that Fc(x) == x-l/~L(x) if and only if
F E MDA(G~) for ~ > 0, where L(x) is a slowly varying
function that satisfies

This implies that the distribution is in the MDA of the
Frechet distribution if and only if the distribution function
is a heavy-tailed power law distribution.
3.2 Threshold Models
As an application of the extreme value theory, the peak
over threshold (POT) method, which studies the excesses
above the threshold u, has been developed [8, 9]. The
POT model suggests that a data series over a certain thresh(cid:173)
old is approximated by the Generalized Pareto distribution
(GPD), which is given by Equation (6).
The conditional probability ofthe excess over the thresh(cid:173)
old u under the condition that X is larger than u is given as
F( )==F(y+u)-F(u)
u y
1 - F(u)
,
(5)
for 0 ::; y  u
is obtained as
Pr{X>xIX>u}= [l+e(:~~)]-l/~
If incidents occur A times per year, then the T -year return
value XT is the solution of the following equation
(u 1+e IT(u)
(
[
XT - u)] -lIe
1
= >.T'
where (u = Pr {X > x}. Consequently the T -year return
value is given by
Hence, substituting the estimated parameters into Equa(cid:173)
tion (8), the estimated T -year return value XT is obtained
as
XT = U+ O-~U) [(.XT(u)€
- 1] ,
(9)
where (u is the proportion of incidents exceeding u.
The estimated T -year return value is sensitive to the scal(cid:173)
ing parameter t. Hence, there exist cases for which we fail
to estimate the value correctly, since we have a limited num(cid:173)
ber of observed repair time values. In our study, we reject
the estimated T -year return values if the values exceed the
max repair time values observed. An advantage of the T(cid:173)
year return value against MTTR is that we can reasonably
reject such misestimated values.
4 Analytical Results
We apply the POT method to the three data sets, the re(cid:173)
pair time data of the in-house system hosted by IBM, the
data collected at the LANL HPC system, and the data stored
at the NERSC Seaborg system. In this section, we assess
the goodness-of-fit of the GPD Illodel and see the etIective(cid:173)
ness of the T -year return value for the assessment of system
availability.
4.1 T-year return value
There are disagreements about the best way to set the
threshold value. In our study, we used the a* method [6] to
choose an optimal threshold value. We chose the threshold
u = 100 for the in-house system data, U = 200 for the LANL
HPC system data, and u = 710 for the NERSC Seaborg sys(cid:173)
tem data. However we found that the estimated T -year re(cid:173)
turn values are relatively insensitive to the particular thresh(cid:173)
old values for the three data sets. With these threshold val(cid:173)
ues, the number of beyond-threshold events was m = 121,
m=666, and m=29.
Maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate
the model parameters t and a(u). We obtained the maxi(cid:173)
mal likelihood estimators by maximizing the log likelihood
function
logL(Xl , ... , Xmle, a(u))
= -mloglT(u) - (1 +~) ~lOg (1+;~)),
solving the 2-dimensional linear equation for t and a(u)
numerically using the Newton-Raphson method. The initial
values for eand a(u) are obtained by a rough estimation
since the moment method does not work for the positive
scaling parametere.

4.1.1
In-house system
For the in-house system, by using the data for the 121
exceedances over the threshold u = 100,
in maximizing
the likelihood estimates the parameters as (€, &) =(0.969,
266.3) with the corresponding maximized log-likelihood of
-1341.2. The inverse of the Fisher information matrix
gives the 95% confidence intervals for the parameter € as
[0.613,1.32] and & as [170.7,361.8]. Recall that the scal(cid:173)
ing exponent a of the power law is given by the recipro(cid:173)
cal of the scaling parameter ~, i.e. a = ~ -1. Then the
estimated scaling exponent is [0.75,1.63] with 95% confi(cid:173)
dence. The estimated scaling exponent a is slightly above
1.0, but there is a possibility that the exponent is less than
1.0 since the confidence interval ranges over 1.0. The ar(cid:173)
rival rate and the exceedance probability is calculated as
~=332/(333/365)=364.0 and (: = 121/332=0.364.
Substituting these estimators into Equation (9), we ob(cid:173)
tain the I-year return value as 31,119.2 and the I-month re(cid:173)
turn value as 2,640.8.
In Figure 5 (a), we show the time
series data together with the I-year return value and 1(cid:173)
month return value. We see that only 1 incident and 10
incidents exceed the I-year return value and I-month re(cid:173)
turn value, respectively during the observation period of333
days. We see that these values are very close to the ex(cid:173)
pected number of times when the repair time exceeds each
return value 333/365 = 0.912 and 333/365 x 12 = 10.9. For
reference, the I-week return value is 560.3, which gives the
realized exceedance as 46, whereas the expected value is
333/365 x 12 x 4 =43.8. This result is also in good agree(cid:173)
ment. The correspondences are summarized in Table 2. The
table shows that the estimated T -year return value predicts
the return value with good accuracy for every time scale.
4.1.2 LANL HPC system
The scaling and positioning parameters are estimated by
maximizing the log likelihood function using the 666 ex(cid:173)
ceedances repair time data of the LANL HPC system. The
parameters are estimated as (t,&) =(0.809, 170.6) with
the corresponding maximized log-likelihood of -5331.6.
The 95% confidence intervals for the parameter €
and &
are calculated as [0.665,0.953] and [144.9,196.4], which
are smaller than those of the in-house system. The corre(cid:173)
sponding confidence interval for the scaling exponent a is
[1.05,1.50]. The arrival rate ,\ and the exceedance proba-
bility (u are calculated as ~ = 3997/(1222/365)= 1193.9 and
(u = 666/3997 = 0.167.
Using the estimated parameters ((, &,~, ~:) we obtain
the I-year return value as 1,5281.5 and the I-month return
value as 2,036.9. We see that the number of exceedances
over the I-year return value is 3 (Figure 5 (b)). The ex(cid:173)
pected value during the observation period of 1,222 days,
is calculated as 1222/365 = 3.34, which gives good agree-
ment with the actual value of3. The number of exceedances
over the I-month return value is 38, whereas the expected
value is 40.2, which also gives good agreement with the
expected value. Again, also for the LANL HPC system,
Table 2 shows that the T -year return value predicts the the
return value with good accuracy over every time scale, from
1 week to 1 year.
4.1.3 NERSC Seaborg system
For the NERSC Seaborg system, the scaling and position(cid:173)
ing parameters are estimated as (€, &) =(0.894, 365.7) with
the corresponding maximized log-likelihood of -280.6 us(cid:173)
ing the 29 exceedances. The 95% parameter confidence
intervals for €
and & are calculated as [0.309,1.48] and
[145.2,586.3]. Due to the limited number of exceedances,
the confidence intervals for this system range widely. The
corresponding confidence interval for a is [0.68, 3.23]. The
arrival rate ,\ and the exceedance probability (u are calcu(cid:173)
lated as ~ = 170/(1998/365) = 31.0 and (u = 29/170 = 0.171.
We obtain the I-year return value as 2,117.0 and 1(cid:173)
month return value as 497.0. We see that the number of
exceedances over the I-year return value is 6 (Figure 5 (c)).
The expected value during the observation period of 1,998
days, is calculated as 1998/365 = 5.47, which gives good
agreement with the realized value of 6. The number of
exceedances over the I-week return is 285.4, whereas the
expected value is 88. As is mentioned in subsection 2.1.3,
in this system, there is a short fraction of incidents whose
repair times are short. We believe that the cause of the
disagreement is this bias in the distribution of short repair
times.
The agreement of the estimated T -year return values
with the actual values in the three systems suggests that we
can do a goodjob at predicting the worst cases that may oc(cid:173)
cur during the next fixed period in the future by estimating
the T -year return values.
4.2 Time series data for Sample T-year re(cid:173)
turn value
Figure 6 shows the time series plot for sample T -year
return value XT,j, which is calculated using observed sam(cid:173)
ples {Xi: i = 1 .. . j}. As is mentioned in Section 3.3,
there are cases for which we fail to estimate the value cor(cid:173)
rectly due to the sensitivity of the T-year return value to
the scaling parameter t.
In our study, we filter those in(cid:173)
valid values by testing whether or not the estimated T -year
return values exceed the repair time values observed over
T -years.
In Figure 6, the periods without lines show the
