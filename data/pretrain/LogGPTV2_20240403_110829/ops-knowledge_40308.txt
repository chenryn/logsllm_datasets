User: In a large software development project, how to use a code hosting platform (such as GitHub) for version control and collaborative development?
Assistant: 1. Create a code warehouse: Create a code warehouse on GitHub, name it and add a description, and determine the language type. 2. Configure the local environment: install Git and bind the GitHub account, and then perform account authentication. At the same time, you need to configure the relevant settings of Git, such as email address, user name and other information. 3. Clone the warehouse: Use the Git clone command in the code directory of the local environment to copy the code warehouse files to the local. 4. Create and switch branches: If you want to carry out collaborative development, it is recommended to cut out a branch based on the original branch. During collaborative development, the merge work can be completed without affecting the original branch. 5. Development, submission, and push: To develop locally, you need to continuously submit code and push it to GitHub at the same time. Each commit description needs to be detailed enough to allow for subsequent backtracking. 6. Pull Request: If a merge is required, a Pull Request must be submitted. The purpose is to facilitate other developers to conduct code review, propose amendments, etc. 7. Code Review: Review the provided code and review it. If the review fails and needs to be modified, submit the code again for review. 8. Merge branch: If the code review passes, the code will be merged into the original branch. At this point, a development task is completed. The above are roughly the steps to use GitHub for version control and collaborative development. At the same time, we also need to pay attention to details such as code protection and multiple inspections of code quality.
