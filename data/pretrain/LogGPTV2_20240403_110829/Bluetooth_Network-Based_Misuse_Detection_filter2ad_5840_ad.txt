One measurement for determining the relative respon-
siveness of an intrusion detection system is the speed at
which the IDS can process trafﬁc. Table 3 shows traf-
ﬁc processed off-line by the IDS, and the time required to
match the entire set of rules against the different trafﬁc sets.
The results show that the system can process roughly 1,000
packets of data in roughly one second. It is important to
note that the term packet here describes logical packets, not
physical packets, since the protocol analyzer combines sev-
eral packet fragments together and exports them as one log-
ical packet. Further, the analyzer does not export any base-
band or radio layer trafﬁc, since the IDS system is only con-
cerned with identifying the malicious activity on the upper
layers of the Bluetooth protocol.
7.4 Evaluation of Response Capability
The results of responding to attacks were also tested and
measured. Through the use of ﬂash-enabled Bluetooth ra-
dios, the system created honeypots to distract attackers and
sent falsiﬁed messages to terminate attacks.
7.4.1 Reconnaissance Response
Honeypots have been used effectively to distract attackers
from IP targets.[42] However, this section describes the re-
sults of using honeypots to distract mobile attackers on the
Bluetooth protocol. An advantage of Bluetooth attacks over
typical wireless attacks is the relatively quick time in which
an attacker can ﬁnd and comprise a target. These results
present the success of one method of aggressively respond-
ing to a reconnaissance threat by ﬂooding the attacker with
false honeypot targets in order to increase the time required
for an attacker to ﬁnd a target device.
To confuse an attacker, the IDS used the following tech-
nique. Upon notiﬁcation of a reconnaissance probe, the
system responded by deploying three Bluetooth radios that
388388
constantly changed their user-friendly names and physical
MAC addresses. Thus, it appeared to the attacker that there
was a large volume of Bluetooth targets. In order to create
the mirage of targets, the system ﬂashed the chipsets of each
Bluetooth radio. On average, it took 5.7947 seconds to ﬂash
the chipset, reboot the chip and change the device name af-
ter responding to an inquiry. Thus, the system essentially
created ten false targets per radio per minute.
To verify the results, the authors wrote a reconnaissance
program that recorded the names of unique targets detected
per minute. On average, the inquiry program detected only
4 false targets per additional radio per minute. This lower
value corresponds to an inquiry period of 10.24 seconds
plus the short period during which an attacker must ask for
the user-friendly name of the Bluetooth device. At a cost
of $3 per Bluetooth radio, a production system could easily
employ hundreds of Bluetooth radios to quickly distract an
attacker. Further, the system could place these throughout
an organization to distract attackers.
7.4.2 Denial of Service Responses
The authors further tested the IDS response system by at-
tempting to break ongoing denial of service attacks using
falsiﬁed connection termination messages.[15] In order to
utilize this attack method, the attack must know both the
physical addresses of the attacker (master) and target de-
vice (slave) in the piconet. The system already had knowl-
edge of the master address from discovery by the protocol
analyzer. Had the system been implemented using another
method, the master address would also have been available
as a ﬁeld in FHS packet sent at the start of the connection.
However, gaining access to the target address proved more
challenging. The packet header only includes a 3-bit AMA
address referring to the slave’s position in the piconet. Thus,
the response node had to scan for all discoverable devices.
The response system then forged packets from all of those
devices to the attacker.
The system then attempted to stop an attacker attacking
via the BlueSmack Attack. The system successfully termi-
nated a denial of service attack. At the attacker’s console,
the denial of service program reported a connection timeout
and disconnected from the target, stopping the attack. Fur-
ther testing showed that the response capability disrupted
similar attacks such as Tanya, Ping of Death, and Symbian
Remote Restart attacks.
7.4.3
Information Theft Responses
Next, the authors tested the ability of the system to respond
to information theft attacks such as the BlueSnarf, BlueBug,
CarWhisperer, and HeloMoto attacks, by establishing false
targets. Establishing false targets protects the vulnerable

targets by creating phony devices with the same physical
address as the vulnerable target.
To test the defense, the authors simply ﬂashed a radio
with the same physical address as a vulnerable device. The
authors then attempted to perform an attack against the vul-
nerable device. Because the ﬂashed device had a higher
power class, it answered and generated replies for the traf-
ﬁc intended for the vulnerable target. This caused the attack
to fail on all four attack methods above. The more power-
ful phony-target-response device responded to the message
instead of the intended target. Based on the success of this
test, the implemented system could be further expanded by
creating phony services that supplied false information to
attackers. However, this method of response is limited in
the fact that it unfortunately causes a denial of service at-
tack in the process.
8 Conclusion
Bluetooth is becoming a ubiquitous protocol. While
standard applications include smartphones, hands-free au-
dio, global positioning devices, cameras, and peripheral
cable replacement, Bluetooth devices also exist in health
care, mobile banking, and military applications. Bluetooth-
enabled devices now carry sensitive information, attracting
hackers.
The lack of mandatory authentication, a weak encryption
key scheme, and differing vendor protocol implementations
have created the possibility for several attacks on Bluetooth
devices. Recent trends have shown an increase in attacks
on Bluetooth-enabled devices and the combination of other
attacks implemented over Bluetooth. Furthermore, the ease
of implementing Bluetooth attacks has decreased with the
proliferation of several tools and online repositories of in-
formation.
This paper presents a network intrusion detection sys-
tem, based on misuse detection, to detect Bluetooth at-
tacks. This system has the limitation of all misuse detection
schemes, which is the inability to automatically new cate-
gories of attacks. However, the system provides an efﬁcient
and effective means of detecting known intrusions. Further-
more, the system demonstrates the ability to determine the
success of an attack, and is resistant to attacks on the IDS
itself.
This work demonstrates that a Bluetooth intrusion de-
tection system can actively respond to threats. This work
presents a means to distract attackers via the use of a mirage
of Bluetooth devices. Further, this work implements a sys-
tem for stopping ongoing attacks through specially crafted
messages.
Limitations of the work and possible future directions
include:
1. Inability to automatically recognize new classes of at-
tack. The potential of anomaly detection for Bluetooth
remains to be investigated.
2. Fusing data from IDS sensors on different piconets
might provide a broader view of attack strategies.
3. Identifying the geographic location of the attacker
might be possible using the technique of Rodriguez et
al.[44]. This would provide a wider scope for effective
intrusion responses.
4. Integration of the IDS with other Bluetooth security
assessment toolsuites.
