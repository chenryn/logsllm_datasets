User: According to the following scenarios, please provide a reasonable load balancing solution for coping with business peak hours. During the promotion period of an Internet company's e-commerce platform, the number of user visits will increase significantly, causing the server load to be too high and the service to be unavailable. There are currently 6 servers, which need to achieve load balancing and be able to automatically expand capacity during peak business hours to ensure service stability and availability.
Assistant: For such a high-traffic website, a reliable load balancing solution is to use multiple servers to handle requests at the same time. In this scenario, a hardware load balancer and multiple virtual servers can be used to achieve load balancing and automatic expansion. The role of the hardware load balancer is to evenly distribute all request traffic to multiple virtual servers on the backend, so as to avoid service unavailability. At the same time, the hardware load balancer can also configure multiple backup servers, so that when any server fails, the backup server can take its place, thereby ensuring the stability and availability of the service. When realizing automatic expansion, you can use the automatic scaling function provided by the cloud server management platform. This function automatically adds or deletes virtual servers according to the current traffic load. If the current load reaches the predetermined upper limit, the system will automatically create a new virtual server and evenly distribute the new request traffic to multiple servers to avoid overloading. And if the current load drops, the system will automatically delete the virtual server to save resources. The following is the flow chart of the scheme: ![Load balancing scheme flow chart](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20180308173802889?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQvY29kZXdhaW5fZW5nbGlzaA==/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/40 0/fill /I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/q/85) In this flowchart, a hardware load balancer distributes the request traffic evenly to multiple virtual servers, and runs the automatic scaling function to realize automatic expansion and contraction according to the current load condition Allow. In multiple virtual servers, each server can handle request traffic and synchronize with other servers to ensure system reliability and stability.
