Appendix
A Impact on Quality of Services
We measure the impact of the quality of services under the
SigOver attack, where the malicious paging messages are
transmitted at the every subframe 9. This implies that legit-
imate subframes at subframe 9 are overshadowed and lost,
whereas non-overshadowed legitimate subframes may also
be affected by crafted subframes. Speciﬁcally, the RS of the
crafted subframes perturbs the channel estimation averaged
among crafted and non-overshadowed legitimate subframes
(in RRC Connected state), which may disturb the equalization
and incur errors. Despite such factors, the impact of SigOver
attack is validated to kept minimal, as demonstrated in this
section under a range of common, but distinct services of
voice call, web surﬁng, FTP download, and live streaming.
We note that measurements were carried out under a reliable
SigOver attack (>97% success rate) for the UE in the RRC
Connected state.

Voice call. The UEs camping on LTE network use Voice over
LTE (VoLTE) as a call service. We evaluate the impact of the
SigOver attack on the key factors with respect to the VoLTE
performance [13]; or equivalently, the call quality, e.g., data
rate, jitter, and packet loss. Such metrics were measured be-
fore and after the attack for comparison. The data rate was
kept stable after the attack, and omitted for brevity. Figure 12
illustrates the jitter and the packet loss. The jitter was con-
sistently less than 10ms, and the packet loss is mostly kept
as zero. Moreover, both were sufﬁcient to support high qual-
ity call services [24]. This keeps the SigOver attack stealthy
without degrading user experience.

Figure 13: Webpage loading time
Web-browsing. We extend the measurements to web brows-
ing, which is one of the most frequently used services. Specif-
ically, the time required to load multiple identical web pages
with and without the attack. Figure 13 presents the results,
with ‘HTTP’ representing the total duration of HTTP data
exchange for page loading. ‘Signaling’ is the time required
for RRC connection establishment. Under the SigOver attack,
the time from the RRC connection initiation to the web page
downloading is delayed by an average of only 80ms when
compared with the case without the attack. Previous stud-
ies [12] have shown that the impact of such lag on the quality
of the experience is negligible.

Figure 14: FTP throughput
FTP downloading. Figure 14 reveals that the FTP exhibited
a signiﬁcantly different performance under the SigOver at-
tack. This is due to dynamically controlled modulation, to
overcome the bit error in the communication. The SigOver
attack incurs bit errors, which force the UE to use a robust
modulation of QPSK, which has a limited throughput. Con-
versely, without the attack, the bit error is kept low. In this
case, the UE used 64QAM which is less robust but supports
higher throughput than QPSK. However, this impact is less
likely to be experienced by the users and FTP rarely used on
smartphones.

Figure 15: YouTube Live throughput: The average was 0.445
and 0.436MBps for attack and normal case, respectively.
Live streaming. Figure 15 shows the throughput of the
YouTube live streaming at a resolution of 1080p. In sum-
mary, neither buffering nor interruption occurred under the
SigOver attack during a 5-min video clip. The result of the
live streaming differs from that of the FTP downloads, as
streaming throughput was not as high as that of the FTP.
