Symfony version | 3.4  
After upgrading to Symfony 3.4 beta1, I'm seeing a ton of deprecations like
this one:
    The "Twig_Extension::getName()" method is deprecated since 1.26 (to be removed
    in 2.0), not used anymore internally. You should not extend it from
    "Symfony\Bridge\Twig\Extension\LogoutUrlExtension"
@sstok suggested on the Symfony Slack chat to require Twig 1.26 as the minimum
version, because that's the one which deprecated `getName()` and the first
version where we can remove it without making the applications fail.
