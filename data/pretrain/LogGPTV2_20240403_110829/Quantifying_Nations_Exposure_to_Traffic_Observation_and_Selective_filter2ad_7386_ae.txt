For the remaining 53 organization-country pairs, we compute the contribu-
tion to the CTI sum of the highest-ranked AS in each organization. We separate
these into three groups: (i) In 36 org-country pairs, the top AS contributes at
least 90% of the CTI sum (98% on average). In these 36 cases, then, a single
AS is responsible for the vast majority of the organization’s transit inﬂuence.
(ii) In 7 org-country pairs, the contribution to the CTI sum of the additional
ASes—other than the top AS—in the organization is between 0.01–0.04 (between
11–29% of the CTI sum), or 0.02 on average. Therefore, the change in CTI as a
result of their inclusion is relatively marginal.
(iii) In the remaining 10 org-country pairs, only 4 have a CTI sum greater
than 0.1. For these, we compute the CT In of the organization to determine the
contribution of the top AS in each organization (rather than a lower bound).
In all 4 cases, the top AS contributes 61% or more of the organization’s CT In
(country-org, perc. of CT In): VE-Lumen (87% of 0.16), SZ-Orange (61% of
0.14), WS-Lumen (73% of 0.30), and TV-Internap (62% of 0.11). Three of these
countries are either a microstate (SZ) or a small island nation (WS and TV).
The last instance, in Venezuela, is likely a consequence of the merger of two large
companies: AS3356 (Level 3) and AS3549 (Global Crossing) [41].
8 Limitations
At a high level, CTI assumes all ASes and IP addresses are equivalent, which
is certainly not the case. At the AS level, it is possible that one, dominant AS
provides stronger security than a multitude of smaller ASes with tighter budgets.
From the perspective of an attacker, though, a single AS having high CTI creates
an opportunity; in the case of sophisticated attackers such as nation-states, the
possibility of inﬁltration of any network cannot be discarded, but compromising
many ASes simultaneously—in order to observe traﬃc towards countries where
no AS has high CTI—may be more challenging. As such, ASes with very high
666
A. Gamero-Garrido et al.
CTI still present a concerningly large observation footprint, regardless of their
level of security against inﬁltration18.
Similarly, IP addresses can represent vastly diﬀerent entities. Both access and
transit ASes may deploy carrier-grade network access translation (CGNAT) [53].
Since our model treats all routed IPs equally, it does not currently take into
account the number of hosts multiplexing a single IP address. We leave this
to future work, but note that an additional weight may be added to CTI: one
that scales up the number of IP addresses in a given preﬁx by the number
of hosts—or the number of “eyeballs”—connected to those IPs, on aggregate.
Even within a given network, however, individual hosts are unlikely to be equally
important as some (e.g., those belonging to governmental organizations or power-
grid operators) may have more sensitive traﬃc. Conversely, some networks might
not even actually use all their IP addresses—although the latter issue is likely
less of a concern in the countries we have studied as their allocation of IPv4
addresses tends to be constrained [24].
In addition to this fundamental conceptual limitation, there are a variety of
technical details that could have out-sized impact on our conclusions:
Incomplete BGP data. We acknowledge that the BGP paths we observe and
use to compute CTI are incomplete given the location of BGP monitors. Given
the serious implications for countries that appear highly exposed to external
observation and selective tampering by an AS, we argue that it is important to
study such exposure with available data. Further, we note that there are two
important factors aiding the credibility of our CTI ﬁndings: (i) our validation
with network operators, who have conﬁrmed that the set of transit ASes iden-
tiﬁed in their countries is largely consistent with their own understanding of
the country’s routing ecosystem. (ii) There is greater visibility over p2c links
in the AS-level topology [25,48], which enables our analysis as we are studying
exposure to observation or selective tampering by transit ASes, in particular.
Despite these mitigating factors, we recognize that BGP incompleteness may
impact the accuracy of CTI ﬁndings. We leave to future work an analysis of CTI’s
sensitivity to changes in the BGP input (which would further mitigate concerns
with BGP incompleteness), e.g., the addition or removal of BGP monitors, or
the addition or removal of ASes who feed into each monitor. Finally, we note
that CTI incorporates an outlier ﬁlter (Sect. 4.2 and Sect. 9.1) which has been
shown as robust to changes in BGP input monitors [31].
Traﬃc. We use a country’s geolocated IP(v4) addresses as a proxy for the
nation’s traﬃc, as this is a limited resource that is necessary to connect any
device to the Internet. IP addresses are often used as a proxy for traﬃc, e.g.,
in [61], and previous work has found strong correlations between number of IP
addresses observed in BGP and traﬃc volume for ASes that provide either access
or transit service [47]. An AS that serves a larger number of IP addresses would
consequently have more capabilities for traﬃc observation, either of a larger
share of potential devices, or of traﬃc that is more sensitive in nature.
18 Recall that CTI studies exposure to inbound traﬃc observation or selective tamper-
ing, which is unaﬀected by potentially asymmetric AS paths.

Additionally, we do not study direct peering with cloud/content providers,
who are responsible for large volumes of user-destined traﬃc. In addition to
p2p links with access or transit networks, these content providers may have in-
network caches in the countries we study. These caches may be placed in the
access network itself, in the inﬂuential transit providers we have identiﬁed, or
elsewhere [17]. Content providers are large and complex distributed systems,
employing sophisticated load balancing [27], routing, and DNS [62] techniques.
Given these complexities, we leave to future work an evaluation of the impact
on CTI of direct peering with cloud/content providers, and in-network cache
placements.
Imperfect geolocation. A potential source of inaccuracy is IP geolocation,
as assigning preﬁxes to a geographic area is challenging and the commercial
providers who sell such information use proprietary methods. We have mitigated
these concerns by calculating CTI using two commercial providers (Sect. 3), and
ﬁnd that the metric remains stable. We have also limited our analysis to the
country level, where geolocation is more accurate than at ﬁner granularities [18,
35,52]. Further, while determining the location of preﬁxes originated by large
transit providers with a global presence is problematic because of its dynamic
nature and wide geographic spread, most networks are much smaller and will
have limited geographic presence beyond their primary country of operation [69]
(where most or all of their addresses will be located).
IPv6. Finally, we note that although our model has so far only been applied
to IPv4 addresses—a reasonable scope given that IPv6 deployment is far from
wide in many developing regions, including Africa [13,46]—the code libraries and
software tools we have used are compatible with IPv6, enabling future research
in this area.
Inferring Primarily-Transit Countries. Any active campaign launched using
publicly available infrastructure will be limited in its eﬀectiveness to reveal peer-
ing links by the location of vantage points (VPs) from which the traceroutes are
launched. Our campaign is no exception: our VPs are located in a small subset
of the world’s ASes, and primarily in Europe and North America. However, we
argue that our measurements form a suﬃcient basis to infer that, in the countries
we have identiﬁed, foreign peering is rare, since: (i) we discussed our ﬁndings
with operators in 12% of these countries, all of whom have conﬁrmed that their
nation relies primarily on transit providers to receive traﬃc from other countries
since foreign peering there is rare to nonexistent; (ii) while our measurements
are launched primarily from the U.S. and Europe, these regions do serve as
important content sources and transit hubs (incl. for intracontinental traﬃc) for
countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa [16,30,32,34,40], where
most of the nations we have identiﬁed are located.
9 Related Work
Several previous studies have focused on country-level routing, both for the iden-
tiﬁcation of topological bottlenecks [42,58] and to evaluate the impact of speciﬁc
668
A. Gamero-Garrido et al.
countries’ ASes on routes towards other countries [39]. All of these studies have
used delegation data to map an entire AS to a country; these inferences are
prone to inaccuracies when compared with more accurate and granular data
such as IP-level geolocation, as important transit ASes may span multiple or
many countries, or operate in a country diﬀerent from their registration.
Previous work focused on the topologies of speciﬁc countries (Germany [66]
and China [68]) and relied on country-speciﬁc methods and data sets that do not
generalize to automatic inference of AS inﬂuence in any given country. Fanou et
al. [28] studied the interdomain connectivity of intracontinental paths in Africa,
using a large traceroute campaign (rather than BGP paths).
CAIDA’s AS Rank [48] is another topological metric developed to character-
ize the customer footprint of an AS on the global routing system. It does not
try to capture the capabilities for observation of a transit AS for traﬃc ﬂowing
towards a country; we developed the CTI metric to try to do so.
9.1 National Chokepoint Potential and Hegemony
In this subsection, we describe diﬀerences between CTI and two closely related
metrics, National Chokepoint Potential (NCP) [42] and Hegemony [31].
NCP. Leyba et al. [42] identiﬁed topological bottlenecks, a framework that
would also help in quantifying exposure to observation (as CTI aims to address),
but with some methodological diﬀerences, including: they identify transnational
links towards each country using delegation records, and they deﬁne bottle-
neck ASes as those serving the most paths (rather than IP addresses). Further,
both CTI and Leyba et al. [42] have as a goal the identiﬁcation of international
inbound—and, in their case, also outbound—chokepoints (i.e., topological bot-
tlenecks) in each country, based on actual (CTI) or simulated (NCP) BGP paths
towards each origin AS. However, their work does not try to capture the fraction
of the country’s addresses served by a transit provider, but rather the fraction
of paths that a border AS (i.e., an AS which is registered to the same country
as the origin, but which has a neighbor that is registered to another country)
may be able to intercept. Our work is more narrowly focused on the speciﬁc case
of a transit provider serving traﬃc towards a transit-dominant country, taking
into account the address space of the direct or indirect customers. Conceptu-
ally, weighting by paths enhances the inﬂuence—or potential, in Leyba et al.’s
terminology—of ASes frequently serving a broad share of the country’s networks,
whereas weighting by IPs yields higher inﬂuence to ASes frequently serving a
large fraction of the country’s end hosts.
Hegemony. Our country-level transit inﬂuence metric is perhaps most sim-
ilar to Hegemony [31]. Both metrics aim to identify the transit ASes that are
most prevalent on paths towards origin ASes, weighted by the IP address space
they serve. Hegemony can be applied either to the global AS-level graph, or to
a “Local graph: ... made only from AS paths with the same origin AS” [31]. The
latter application is closest to CTI, as this analysis is limited to paths reaching
a single origin AS; indeed, we use some of Hegemony local’s ﬁltering techniques
in our analysis (Sect. 4.2). The applicability of (local-graph) Hegemony to the
Quantifying Nations’ Exposure to Traﬃc Observation

problem of revealing which transit ASes have observation capabilities over traﬃc
ﬂowing towards a speciﬁc country—the issue addressed by CTI—is limited, as
Hegemony is a metric of centrality of transit ASes on a speciﬁc origin AS (not a
country).
We build a country-level alternative metric based on Hegemony [31] and
compare CTI to it. The reason for the comparison is to determine if CTI is
too aggressive in its ﬁlters, discarding too much input data. For that purpose,
we build a benchmark using Hegemony local, a metric of centrality of any AS
(including both transit providers and peers) on paths towards a single origin.
Hegemony consists mostly of a single ﬁlter on input BGP data, making it an
appropriate benchmark. This benchmark was not trivial to build, as Hegemony
local produces a bilateral metric of inﬂuence between a transit AS and an origin
AS on the global topology. While Hegemony is concerned with extracting the
most accurate estimate of centrality on an existing graph, and not with estimat-
ing country-level inbound route diversity as CTI, it is possible to build a metric
that serves a similar purpose as CTI, which we call country-level Hegemony
(CLH) as
CLH(ASt, C) ∈ [0, 1] =
(cid:2)
ASo∈(C)
H(ASt, ASo) · a∗(ASo, C)
A(C)
,
where H(ASt, ASo) is the Hegemony score of ASt on ASo during the same
period19 in March 2020 when we applied CTI, (all the other terms have been
previously introduced in Eq. 6.3).
We computed the absolute value of the diﬀerence between CTI and CLH for
each AS-coutry pair. The output of this analysis is (25th perc.,mean,median,75th
perc.) = 0.00000, 0.00104, 0.00002, 0.00017, suggesting that both metrics tend
to agree about the country-level inﬂuence of marginal ASes (the vast majority
of AS-country pairs). Therefore, we ﬁnd no evidence that the heuristics of CTI
introduce unnecessary noise to our analysis because, on aggregate, a country-
level alternative based on Hegemony—which excludes considerably fewer BGP
monitors than CTI does—tends to agree with CTI’s assessment. The metrics
do diverge on their assessment of ASes that CTI has identiﬁed as inﬂuential
(CTI≥ 0.1), with an avg. diﬀerence between the metrics in those cases of 0.07.
10 Conclusions and Future Work
In this work we tackled the issue of quantifying the exposure of a country’s
traﬃc to observation or tampering by speciﬁc ASes. The Country-Level Transit
Inﬂuence (CTI) metric we developed aims to overcome several challenges with
making such inferences using BGP data. We apply this metric in a set of—
potentially at-risk—countries where transit provider-customer relationships are
still the dominant inbound modality for international traﬃc; we identiﬁed these

nations using both passive and active measurements. We applied CTI in these
75 countries and found that the median nation has 35% of their IP addresses
served by a single transit AS.
In the future, we would like to develop measurement and analysis techniques
that can be applied to study the exposure of countries that are not primarily
served by transit providers, but rather by a dense mesh of bilateral and multi-
lateral peering agreements, including those involving cloud providers and CDNs.
