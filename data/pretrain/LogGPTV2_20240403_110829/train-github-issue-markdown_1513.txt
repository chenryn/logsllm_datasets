Challenge Clone an Element Using jQuery has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/43.0`.  
Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
      jQuery Playground
          #left-well
            #target1
            #target2
            #target3
          #right-well
            #target4
            #target5
            #target6
Once i add the line:  
$("#target5").clone().appendTo("#left-well");
The element is cloned once, as expected. But once i click to 'run the tests',
it is cloned a second time.
Then, moving on to the following exercise, you can still see this duplicate
element. Once i edit the code (anywhere), the duplicate disappears.
But, I think this might confuse some other people, if they see it being cloned
twice and believe this to be the 'normal' behaviour for the ".clone" function.
Note: Using the latest Firefox, and tried clearing my browser, etc.

Edit: I also see this duplicate in all subsequent exercises that contain this
line. It stays present until any part of the code is edited.
