        Modifies flags: None  
        A byte, word or dword is read from "port" and placed in AL, AX or         
EAX respectively.  If the port number is in the range of 0-255         it can be 
specified as an immediate, otherwise the port number         must be 
specified in DX.  Valid port ranges on the PC are 0-1024,         though 
values through 65535 may be specified and recognized by         third party 
vendors and PS/2's.

        - 386+ protected mode timings depend on privilege levels.  
          first number is the timing if:    CPL ?IOPL  
          second number is the timing if:   CPL > IOPL or in VM 86 mode (386)                                             
CPL ?IOPL  (486)           third number is the timing when:    virtual mode on 486 
processor         - 486 virtual mode always requires 27 cycles
