I followed the documentation for DevTools extensions and executed the following command in my Electron Chrome console:

```javascript
require('remote').require('browser-window').addDevToolsExtension('/some-directory/react-devtools');
// This returns "React Developer Tools"
```

However, I encountered a `TypeError` in the terminal:

```
[1438:0520/120118:ERROR:CONSOLE(74)] "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getURL' of undefined", source: chrome-extension://extension-1/agents/ReactInspectorAgent.js (74)
```

Upon inspecting `ReactInspectorAgent.js` at line 74, I found the following code:

```javascript
// agents/ReactInspectorAgent.js
var runtimeURL = chrome.extension.getURL(fileName);
```

It appears that `chrome.extension` is `undefined`. How could this happen?

- **Electron Version:** 0.25.1
- **React DevTools Version:** 0.13.1

### Additional Context
- The error suggests that the `chrome.extension` object is not available in the current context.
- This might be due to differences in how Electron and Chrome handle extensions, or it could be a version-specific issue.

### Possible Solutions
1. **Check Compatibility:**
   - Ensure that the `react-devtools` version you are using is compatible with your Electron version.
   - Consider updating both Electron and `react-devtools` to their latest versions if possible.

2. **Alternative Loading Method:**
   - Try loading the React DevTools extension using a different method, such as:
     ```javascript
     const { session } = require('electron');
     session.defaultSession.loadExtension('/some-directory/react-devtools');
     ```

3. **Debugging:**
   - Add more logging to understand where the `chrome.extension` object is being set or why it is `undefined`.
   - Check if there are any known issues or open bugs related to this problem in the Electron or `react-devtools` repositories.

If you have any additional information or have tried other solutions, please let me know.
