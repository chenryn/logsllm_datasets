**Important Note:**
The ongoing development of Keras is currently being managed at `github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow`. If you need to report a bug, please create a new issue in the TensorFlow repository. Please be aware that multi-backend Keras development has been discontinued. Do not report issues related to multi-backend Keras (Keras 2.3.1 and lower). Instead, only report issues concerning the TensorFlow implementation of Keras (`tf.keras`).

### How to Convert a Tensor from Shape (None, 224, 224, 1) to (None, 224, 224, 3)?

To convert a tensor from shape `(None, 224, 224, 1)` to `(None, 224, 224, 3)`, you can use the `tf.tile` function in TensorFlow. This function allows you to replicate the tensor along a specified dimension. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming `input_tensor` is your input tensor with shape (None, 224, 224, 1)
input_tensor = ...  # Your input tensor here

# Use tf.tile to replicate the tensor along the last dimension
output_tensor = tf.tile(input_tensor, [1, 1, 1, 3])

# `output_tensor` now has shape (None, 224, 224, 3)
```

This code will replicate the single channel (the last dimension) three times, resulting in a tensor with three channels.
