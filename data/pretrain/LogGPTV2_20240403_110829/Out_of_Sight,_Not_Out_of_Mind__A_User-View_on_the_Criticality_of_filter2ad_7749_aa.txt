## Abstract
Nearly all international data is carried by a mesh of submarine cables connecting virtually every region in the world. It is generally assumed that Internet services rely on this submarine cable network (SCN) for backend traffic, but that most users do not directly depend on it, as popular resources are either local or cached nearby. In this paper, we study the criticality of the SCN from the perspective of end users. We present a general methodology for analyzing the reliance on the SCN for a given region and apply it to the most popular web resources accessed by users in 63 countries, collectively capturing approximately 80% of the global Internet population. Our findings indicate that up to 64.33% of all web resources accessed from a specific country rely on the SCN. Despite the explosive growth of data center and CDN infrastructure, at least 28.22% of CDN-hosted resources still traverse a submarine cable.

## 1. Introduction
Ninety-nine percent of all international data is carried by a mesh of submarine cables at the bottom of the ocean, connecting nearly every region in the world. While initial deployments of the submarine network date back to the mid-19th century, the recent explosion of Internet traffic has driven an exponential increase in the total capacity required of this infrastructure.

Today, the submarine cable network (SCN) is recognized as vitally important to the global economy and as an enabler of sustainable growth in developing regions. For instance, it is estimated that if the approximately 40 cables connecting the US to the rest of the world were cut, only 7% of the total US traffic volume could be carried by satellite. At the same time, new cable deployments increase international capacity and add competition at the backhaul level, triggering drops in wholesale and connectivity prices, thus helping expand Internet access previously limited by cost.

Despite its obvious importance, there is a lack of clear understanding of the criticality of the SCN in the global Internet. While it is generally understood that Internet services rely on the SCN for backend traffic, the common assumption is that most Internet users do not directly depend on it, as popular resources are either local or cached by nearby CDN servers. The recurrence of country-wide disconnections or performance issues due to submarine cable cuts casts doubt on this assumption.

In this work, we study the criticality of the SCN from the perspective of Internet end users. We present a general methodology for analyzing the reliance on the SCN for a given region and apply it to the most popular web resources accessed by users in over 60 countries, covering every inhabited continent and collectively capturing approximately 80% of the global Internet population. We show that up to 64.33% of all resources accessed from an island country and 43.18% accessed from a non-island country rely on the SCN. Even from landlocked countries, 16.25% of all web requests, on average, depend on the SCN. Despite the explosive growth of datacenter and CDN infrastructure, at least 28.22% of CDN-hosted resources traverse a submarine cable, with that figure as high as 65.1% for some countries.

To encourage further research on the criticality of the SCN, we make our measurement framework, dataset, and analysis code publicly available at https://github.com/NU-AquaLab/Criticality-SCN.

## 2. Motivation
Today’s SCN includes over 400 cables across more than 1 million kilometers, transferring over 1 Pbps of traffic. The majority of these cables have been constructed and managed by consortia and are shared by multiple network operators. However, the latest construction boom has been largely driven by content providers such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. According to TeleGeography, the amount of capacity deployed by content providers has risen tenfold between 2013 and 2017, outpacing all other customers of international bandwidth.

Damage to submarine cables can cause widespread network issues impacting Internet services and end users, especially when multiple such events occur in a short time period. One particularly severe example was the 2008 submarine cable disruption, wherein a series of cable cuts within a two-week period resulted in 14 countries experiencing connectivity issues ranging from complete disconnections to severely limited bandwidth. In early 2013, divers off the coast of Egypt attempting to cut the SEA-WE-ME-4 cable caused a 60% drop in Internet speed, which took about 20 hours to recover from. As recently as January 2020, cable cuts to FALCON, SAT3/WASC, and WACS resulted in major outages and degraded Internet performance in parts of the Middle East and throughout much of Africa.

Despite continued investments in the SCN over the last three decades, increased caching infrastructure (e.g., CDNs) around the globe, and data centers moving closer to the network edge, major events such as these seem to occur with some regularity, directly impacting not only backend traffic but also resource retrieval for end users.

Previous works have demonstrated how changes in SCN infrastructure can affect network traffic at a general level (e.g., performance and reachability). Our goal is to understand, empirically, the degree to which the SCN is critical for end users. To this end, we need to start with a clear, quantifiable definition of criticality.

### 2.1 Defining Criticality
Critical infrastructure generally refers to an asset that is essential to the functioning of a society, its economy, public health, or safety. In this work, we focus on the SCN infrastructure, looking at its criticality from the perspective of the individual, rather than from the perspective of society as a whole.

For our analysis, we use the top Alexa sites for each country as a proxy for identifying Internet resources that are important to users in that region. We define the criticality of the SCN as the percentage of resources for these top sites retrieved via SCN infrastructure, as revealed by our analysis. We use this to calculate a SCN hit rate for a region.

In considering criticality, we focus on the impact of SCN failures on reachability, and leave the potential impact on performance—as networks route around failures via potentially less optimal paths—for future work.

Other categories of network applications such as personalized live streaming, video conferencing, and IP telephony could serve as viable proxies for evaluating the criticality of the SCN, potentially requiring a different methodology and yielding different results. This is another promising direction for future research.

## 3. Methodology
In this section, we describe the methodology developed for this work. At a high level, for a given country, we aim to determine the degree of criticality of the SCN from the perspective of Internet users in that country by:
1. Identifying a set of popular Internet resources (e.g., resources used by top x Alexa sites for the country, popular video hosting/streaming services, etc.).
2. Geographically locating the servers hosting those resources and a sufficient fraction of the routers along the path.
3. Identifying the use of SCN links on the path to the aforementioned servers.

### 3.1 Popular Internet Resources
As a first step in our methodology, we identify a set of popular Internet resources for a given country. For this, we consider the Alexa country/region rankings to identify those resources relied on by the most popular sites for a given country. While other definitions of popularity are plausible, we argue that resources from top Alexa sites are a good proxy, considering that web browsing is one of the most common Internet activities.

### 3.2 Resource Paths Geolocation
After identifying the set of popular Internet resources, we geolocate both the servers hosting them and a large subset of the routers in the path. To this end, we first launch traceroute measurements from RIPE Atlas nodes in each country/region towards the identified hosting servers. With the collected traceroute measurements, we employ the RIPE Atlas IPMap active IP geolocation method to geolocate hosting servers and routers. We also extract geolocation hints from the host names of routers and server infrastructures obtained from reverse DNS and HLOC. As some of the hosting servers can be part of existing cloud or CDN deployments, we use publicly available datasets for major cloud service providers (Amazon and Microsoft Azure) to map their infrastructure to publicly announced server locations. We cross-validate our geolocations using the results from different geolocation techniques. We then leverage online CDN detection tools to tag CDN-hosted resources.

### 3.3 Detecting Submarine Cable Links
In the last step, we tag resources that use SCN links on the path to their hosting servers. We rely on several heuristics for this, building on our previous work. We first employ a simple heuristic to identify possible routes relying on the SCN. Previous work has shown that a significant fraction of all the long-haul physical links in the US are co-located with roadway infrastructure and railroad. Based on this observation, we rely on a heuristic we refer to as "drivability," which can be summarized as follows: if there is no drivable route (avoiding ferries) between each end of a given data path, there must not be a continuous landmass connecting them. This would suggest that some part of the path relies on a submarine cable. Since a small fraction of these routes may instead use a satellite link, we use the difference in round trip time (RTT) between each hop to discard satellite links by checking that the difference is greater than 476 ms (minimum RTT for satellite communication).

Note, however, that even if there is a drivable route, it is still possible that the resource is accessed via a submarine cable. For instance, previous work has shown that network traffic from South Africa to Angola uses the WACS cable. Our heuristic would discard any SCN path as a possible candidate since there is a drivable route between these two endpoints. Thus, our analysis yields a conservative estimate of the criticality of the SCN for particular countries.

Finally, to determine a list of candidate submarine cables capable of carrying network routes, we rely on a second heuristic based on speed of light (SoL) estimations. For each
