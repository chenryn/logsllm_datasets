ABSTRACT
Nearly all international data is carried by a mesh of subma-
rine cables connecting virtually every region in the world.
It is generally assumed that Internet services rely on this
submarine cable network (SCN) for backend traffic, but that
most users do not directly depend on it, as popular resources
are either local or cached nearby. In this paper, we study the
criticality of the SCN from the perspective of end users. We
present a general methodology for analyzing the reliance
on the SCN for a given region, and apply it to the most pop-
ular web resources accessed by users in 63 countries from
every inhabited continent, collectively capturing ≈80% of the
global Internet population. We find that as many as 64.33%
of all web resources accessed from a specific country rely on
the SCN. Despite the explosive growth of data center and
CDN infrastructure around the world, at least 28.22% of the
CDN-hosted resources traverse a submarine cable.

deployments of the submarine network date back to the mid-
19th century [22], the recent explosion of Internet traffic
has driven an exponential proliferation on the total capacity
required of this infrastructure [30].
Today, the submarine cable network (SCN) is recognized
as vitally important to the global economy and as an enabler
of sustainable growth in developing regions [7, 21]. For in-
stance, it is estimated that if the ≈40 cables connecting the
US to the rest of the world were cut, only 7% of the total US
traffic volume could be carried by satellite [28]. At the same
time, new cable deployments increase international capacity
and add competition at the backhaul level, triggering drops
on wholesale and connectivity prices, thus helping expand
Internet access previously limited by cost [18].
Despite its obvious importance, we lack a clear under-
standing of the criticality of the SCN in the global Internet.
While it is generally understood that Internet services rely
on the SCN for backend traffic, the common assumption
is that most Internet users do not directly depend on it, as
popular resources are either local or cached by nearby CDN
servers [19]. The reoccurrence of country-wide disconnec-
tions or performance issues as a result of submarine cable
cuts casts doubt on this assumption [26].
In this work, we study the criticality of the SCN from
the perspective of Internet end users. We present a general
methodology for analyzing the reliance on the SCN of a
given region (§3). We apply this methodology to the most
popular web resources accessed by users in over 60 coun-
tries, covering every inhabited continent in the world and
collectively capturing ≈80% of the global Internet population
(§4). We show (§5) that as many as 64.33% of all resources
accessed from an island country and 43.18% accessed from a
non-island country rely on the SCN. Even from landlocked
countries – those without direct access to an ocean – 16.25%
of all web requests, on average, depend on the SCN. Despite
the explosive growth of datacenter and CDN infrastructure
around the world, we find that on average, at least 28.22% of
the CDN-hosted resources hit a submarine cable, with that
figure as high as 65.1% for some countries.
To encourage further research on the criticality of the SCN,
we make our measurement framework, dataset, and analysis

2 MOTIVATION
Today’s SCN includes over 400 cables across more than 1 mil-
lion kilometers, and transfers over 1 Pbps of traffic [20]. The
majority of these cables have been constructed and managed
by consortia, and are shared by multiple network operators.
TAT-8, for instance, had 35 participants, including most ma-
jor international carriers at the time (including AT&T, British
Telecom and France Telecom) [35]. However, the latest con-
struction boom has been largely driven by content providers
such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon [29]. Ac-
cording to TeleGeography, the amount of capacity deployed
by content providers has risen tenfold between 2013 and
2017, outpacing all other customers of international band-
width [29].
Damage to submarine cables can cause wide-spread net-
work issues impacting Internet services and end users, es-
pecially when multiple such events occur in a short time
period [26]. One particularly severe example was the 2008
submarine cable disruption [36], wherein a series of cable
cuts within a two week period resulted in 14 countries having
connectivity issues that ranged from complete disconnec-
tions to severely limited bandwidth. In early 2013, divers off
the coast of Egypt attempting to cut the cable SEA-WE-ME-4
caused a 60% drop in Internet speed, which took about 20
hours to recover from [17]. As recently as January 2020, cable
cuts to FALCON, SAT3/WASC and WACS resulted in major
outages and degraded Internet performance in parts of the
Middle East and throughout much of Africa [16, 32].
Despite the continued investments in the SCN over the last
three decades, increased caching infrastructure (e.g., CDNs)
around the globe, and data centers moving closer to the
network edge, major events such as these seem to occur
with some regularity, directly impacting not only backend
traffic, but resource retrieval for end users as well.
Previous works have demonstrated how changes in SCN
infrastructure can affect network traffic at a general level
(e.g., performance and reachability) [21, 25]. Our goal is to
understand, empirically, the degree to which the SCN is
critical for end users. To this end, we need to start with a
clear, quantifiable definition of criticality.
2.1 Defining Criticality
Critical infrastructure generally refers to an asset that is es-
sential to the functioning of a society, its economy, public
health, or safety. In this work, we focus on the SCN infras-
tructure, looking at its criticality from the perspective of the
individual, rather than from the perspective of society as a
whole.

For our analysis, we use the top Alexa sites for each coun-
try as a proxy for identifying Internet resources that are
important to users in that region. We thus define the criti-
cality of the SCN as the percentage of resources for these
top sites retrieved via SCN infrastructure, as revealed by our
analysis. We use this to calculate a SCN hit rate of a region.
In considering criticality, we focus on the impact of SCN
failures on reachability, and leave the potential impact on per-
formance – as networks route around failures via potentially
less optimal paths [5, 6] – for future work.
In addition to web browsing, other categories of network
applications such as personalized live streaming, video con-
ferencing and IP telephony could serve as viable proxies for
evaluating the criticality of the SCN, potentially requiring a
different methodology and yielding different results. This is
another promising direction for future research.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe the methodology developed for
this work. At a high level, for a given country, we look to
determine the degree of criticality of the SCN from the per-
spective of Internet users in that country by: (1) identifying a
set of popular Internet resources (e.g., resources used by top x
Alexa sites for the country, popular video hosting/streaming
services, etc.), (2) geographically locating the servers hosting
those resources and a sufficient fraction of the routers along
the path, and (3) identifying the use of SCN links on the path
to the aforementioned servers. The following paragraphs
expand on this.
3.1 Popular Internet Resources
As a first step in our methodology, we identify a set of popu-
lar Internet resources for a given country. For this, we con-
sider the Alexa country/region rankings to identify those
resources relied on by the most popular sites for a given
country. While other definitions of popularity are plausible,
we argue that resources from top Alexa sites are a good proxy,
considering that web browsing is one of the most common
Internet activities.
3.2 Resource Paths Geolocation
After identifying the set of popular Internet resources, we
geolocate both the servers hosting them and a large sub-
set of the routers in the path. To this end, we first launch
traceroute measurements from RIPE Atlas nodes [31] in each
country/region towards the identified hosting servers. With
the collected traceroute measurements, we employ the RIPE
Atlas IPMap [3] active IP geolocation method to geolocate
hosting servers and routers. We also extract geolocation hints
from the host names of routers and server infrastructures
obtained from reverse DNS and HLOC [33]. As some of the
Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind

hosting servers can be part of existing cloud or CDN deploy-
ments, we use publicly available datasets [1, 2] for major
cloud service providers (Amazon and Microsoft Azure) to
map their infrastructure to publicly announced server loca-
tions.1 We cross validate our geolocations using the results
from different geolocation techniques. We then leverage on-
line CDN detection tools to tag CDN-hosted resources.2
3.3 Detecting Submarine Cable Links
In the last step, we tag resources that use SCN links on the
path to their hosting servers. We rely on several heuristics
for this, building on our previous work [20]. We first em-
ploy a simple heuristic to identify possible routes relying
on the SCN. Previous work [24] has shown that a signifi-
cant fraction of all the long-haul physical links in the US are
co-located with roadway infrastructure and railroad. Based
on this observation, we rely on a heuristic we refer to as
drivability which can be summed up as follows – if there is
no drivable route (avoiding ferries) between each end of a given
data path, there must not be a continuous landmass connect-
ing them. This would suggest that some part of the path relies
on a submarine cable. Since a small fraction of these routes
may instead use a satellite link [21], we use the difference in
round trip time (RTT) between each hop to discard satellite
links by checking that the difference is greater than 476 ms
(minimum RTT for satellite communication) [21].
Note, however, that even if there is a drivable route, it is
still possible that the resource is accessed via a submarine
cable. For instance, previous work has shown that network
traffic from South Africa to Angola uses the WACS cable [25].
Our heuristic would discard any SCN path as a possible
candidate since there is a drivable route between these two
endpoints. Thus, our analysis yields a conservative estimate
of the criticality of the SCN for particular countries.
Finally, to determine a list of candidate submarine cables
capable of carrying network routes, we rely on a second
heuristic based on speed of light (SoL) estimations. For each
