User: On a CentOS7 server, how to install and configure the Java environment, complete code compilation and deployment?
Assistant: The following are the steps to install and configure the Java environment on a CentOS7 server, and complete code compilation and deployment: 1. Install JDK: Use the yum command to install OpenJDK or Oracle JDK: - OpenJDK: ```bash sudo yum install java-1.8. 0-openjdk-devel ``` - Oracle JDK: First, download the installation package: ```bash sudo curl -LO --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" "https://download.oracle.com /otn-pub/java/jdk/11.0.11+9/f411702ca7704a54b1dac757ff004bce/jdk-11.0.11_linux-x64_bin.rpm" ``` Then, install: ```bash sudo yum install jdk-11.0.11_linux-x64_bin.r pm ``` After the installation is complete, you can use the following command to verify whether the installation is successful: ```bash java -version ``` 2. Configure environment variables: edit the /etc/profile file and add the following content: ```bash export JAVA_HOME= /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.292.b10-1.el7_9.x86_64 # JDK installation path export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH export CLASSPATH=.:$JAVA_HOME/lib/ dt.jar:$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar ``` Then, execute the following command to make the configuration take effect: ```bash source /etc/profile ``` 3. Code compilation and deployment: use Maven to compile and deploy. First, install Maven: ```bash sudo yum install maven ``` Then, use the following command to compile and package: ```bash mvn clean package ``` After the compilation is completed, a jar package will be generated in the target directory. Use the following command to start the application: ```bash java -jar app.jar ``` where app.jar is the name of the generated jar package.
