Hey there!
I just came across WebPack while being in the need to get rid of many requests
just to gather together some resources (various scripts, etc). For now, I have
been doing this using PHP. A Yii extension allows me to add together all my
scripts into a single file. However, minification and things alike don't work.
There also is no support for some advanced parsing and pre-processing.
So I have a few questions:
  * Within webpack-app (the example app) you used the `jamjs` system for some dependencies. Would you recommend this to work nicely alongside webpack?
  * I currently have quite a few dependencies that I am currently managing via - you are going to scream... - `git submodule`. As you can tell, this is **not** very elegant! My main dependencies include Bootstrap and jQuery, but also smaller jQuery plugins. How can I add these smaller plugins, that are oftenly just a single file, to webpack? Is there a recommended way to do so? As an example for this question, consider `jQuery.stickyFooter` and `jQuery.rangyInputs`.
  * Am I right to assume that loaders are chained by separating them by exclamation points ("!")? I.e.: `style-loader!css-loader!scss-loader`
  * I want to build a loader for OJ. It has a runtime that needs to be included for the browser to work. This runtime currently only supports the browser and needs to run in global space. Imagine I had done the loader, how would I go about loading `.oj` files?
  * Within my app, I have a slightly changing demand for scripts. When I am at `/site/main` I only want jQuery, Bootstrap and some fancy stuff. But when I am within `/chat`, I would like to be able to load a lot more JS files. What is a good way to handle this? I know there is the async way of require-ing files. But how exactly does it work? Do I specify the path directly to the file? Say I have `main.js` and a subfolder called `chat/` containing a few various scripts specially for the chat. How do I load them all?
  * Does webpack understand symlinks? I currently have the Socket.IO client library symlinked into my main folder. What is the best way to get this to the browser?
Sorry for the load of questions - but I decided that it was better to put it
all here instead of spawning one issue per question - I hope you don't mind :)
Webpack looks very promising and I can't wait to use it. I am just currently
considering how to. The CLI seems a bit sparse and I am unsure on how exactly
I have to create my webpack.
Kind regards, Ingwie!
