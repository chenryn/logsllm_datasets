Abstract—This paper presents a system mmSpy that shows
the feasibility of eavesdropping phone calls remotely. Towards
this end, mmSpy performs sensing of earpiece vibrations using
an off-the-shelf radar device that operates in the mmWave
spectrum (77 GHz, and 60 GHz). Given that mmWave radars
are becoming popular in a number of autonomous driving,
remote sensing, and other IoT applications, we believe this is a
critical privacy concern. In contrast to prior works that show
the feasibility of detecting loudspeaker vibrations with larger
amplitudes, mmSpy exploits smaller wavelengths of mmWave
radar signals to detect subtle vibrations in the earpiece devices
used in phonecalls. Towards designing this attack, mmSpy solves
a number of challenges related to non-availability of large scale
radar datasets, systematic correction of various sources of noises,
as well as domain adaptation problems in harvesting training
data. Extensive measurement-based validation achieves an end-
to-end accuracy of 83 − 44% in classifying digits and keywords
over a range of 1-6 ft, thereby compromising the privacy in
applications such as exchange of credit card information. In
addition, mmSpy shows the feasibility of reconstruction of the
audio signals from the radar data, using which more sensitive
information can be potentially leaked.

I. INTRODUCTION
Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication technology is
being increasingly adopted for next generation networking
applications that require low latency and high throughput such
as virtual/augmented reality [47], vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networking [102] in au-
tonomous driving, machine type communications in industrial
IoT [9] etc. In addition to networking, mmWave technology
is also becoming increasingly popular in a number of remote
sensing applications in the areas of material detection, au-
tonomous driving, precision agriculture, vibration sensing in
industries, robotics, etc. [62], [45], [55], [53].
Motivated by these applications, mmWave communication has
been incorporated in 5G and other networking standards,
thereby increasing the proliferation of mmWave sensing and
networking devices in a number of IoT applications. The
technology is readily available on newer smartphones, vir-
tual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headsets, as well as several
off-the-shelf radar devices for autonomous driving applica-
tions. While other exciting applications are around the corner,
this paper takes a step back and exposes a critical capability
in mmWave devices that can enable a malicious adversary to
passively overhear phone calls.
is that the earpiece1 device that users listen to during phone
calls generate minute vibrations in the order of 7 µm. mmSpy
senses these vibrations by detecting the changes in phases of
mmWave signals reflected from the body of the phone. This
opens up the possibility of eavesdropping the audio content of
the remote caller during a phone conversation. In particular,
mmSpy can eavesdrop the contents of the audio even when the
audio is completely inaudible to both humans and microphones
nearby. In addition, since the audio is detected directly from
the source of vibrations, mmSpy’s spying capabilities are
immune to ambient noise, which makes the attack suitable in
noisy and crowded spaces where suspicion is low. This opens
up an interesting attack scenario. An attacker can eavesdrop on
nearby users on phone calls, especially in a social setting like
conferences, or parties and spy on users who might be seated
and engaged in a phone conversation. Credit card numbers,
one-time passwords, SSN numbers, etc. can be stolen within
the capabilities of mmSpy.
Such an attack is challenging for a number of reasons (i) The
vibrations are extremely small (≈ 7 um) in comparison to
the hardware noise floor (ii) The ramping and settling time of
the frequency oscillator used to generate frequency modulated
carrier wave (FMCW) signals introduces a characteristic noise
pattern into phase measurements. (iii) The vibration needs to
be decoupled from other ambient multipath signals in the
environment (iv) Because of the hardware limitations,
the
sampling rate of the sensed vibration tends to be non-uniform
(v) Finally, while robustness of audio/speech processing algo-
rithms depend on large high quality training data, such large
datasets are not available for our problem domain.
mmSpy exploits a number of opportunities to handle the
above challenges. The opportunities listed below map to
the above enumerated challenges in the same order. (i) The
peaks corresponding to multipath components are tracked over
time in order to identify stable reflections and ignore noisy
peaks. (ii) We employ statistical error correction techniques to
model the noise due to ramp/settle times in the oscillator and
systematically subtract it from the phase data corresponding
to vibrations (iii) The reflection from a static object such as
a wall will have low variation in the phases. In contrast, the
reflection from the phone will have higher variation in the
phases because of high frequency audio vibrations. mmSpy
isolates phone reflection from ambient multipath by exploiting
this variation. (iv) The system parameters such as the chirp

and frame rates of the FMCW signal, and the duty cycle
etc., are carefully selected to balance the non-uniform radar
sampling rate with a uniform phase sampling rate for audio.
(v) We model the transformation between high quality audio
to low quality vibration data. Such a modeling allows us to
convert existing large-scale speech processing datasets into
synthetic radar datasets. We use such synthetic datasets to
train machine learning (ML) algorithms for classifying digits,
keywords, as well as performing end-to-end reconstruction
of audio samples. Finally, mmSpy performs fine-tuning of
the models with small-datasets of sensor-data to enhance the
accuracy of audio classification and reconstruction.
Prior works in the area of speech analysis with radar signals
include wireless vibrometry [92] that can detect audio from
loudspeakers using WiFi signals. Similarly, WaveEar [95] can
detect speech signals using mmWave hardware based on re-
flection from a human throat. UWHear [90] uses UWB radios
for separating speech signals from multiple loudspeakers. In
contrast to these works, mmSpy differs in the following ways:
(i) mmSpy shows the feasibility of eavesdropping on earpieces
used during phone calls – the first such attempt to our best
knowledge. (ii) Prior works focus on detecting vibrations from
a loudspeaker, humans, or other sound sources which can also
be heard by a colocated microphone. In contrast, by exploiting
shorter wavelengths of mmWave signals, mmSpy shows the
feasibility of detecting minute vibrations of an earpiece that
cannot be heard by a microphone co-located with the radar.
mmSpy is implemented using off-the-shelf radar devices at
two different frequencies – TI AWR1843 BOOST in 77 GHz,
and IWR6843ISK in 60 GHz – which use FMCW signals.
The attack is performed on two models of smartphones with
contrasting material properties – Google Pixel 4a, and Samsing
Galaxy S20. The radar sensor data is pre-processed offline
with MATLAB/python modules, and fed to machine learning
modules implemented in PyTorch for various applications of
speech processing. The accuracy varies between 83−44% over
a distance of 1-6 feet for applications in digit classification
and keyword recognition. The spectrograms of reconstructed
audio from the spying attack match closely with the ground
truth which is of critical concern from a privacy perspective.
In achieving the above reported levels of attack accuracy
on smartphones with off-the-shelf radar devices, we briefly
enumerate our contributions below: (i) Identification of secu-
rity threats related to eavesdropping of the earpiece devices
used in phone-calls with mmWave radars; (ii) Systematic
preprocessing techniques for subtraction of hardware related
noise and artifacts; (iii) Synthetic training data generation for
training high precision machine learning models for speech
classification and audio reconstruction; (iv) Domain adaptation
techniques for coping up with the domain shift between
synthetic training data and real sensor data; (v) Implemen-
tation and evaluation under various attack scenarios related to
word/digit classification.
Fig. 1 depicts the overall architecture of mmSpy. A synthetic
model in mmSpy is first created with large-scale synthetic
training data generated using popular speech datasets. Towards
handling the residual differences between synthetic and real
radar data, the model is later adapted by using small-scale
training datasets from real radar. The model thus generated is
used for launching the eavesdropping attack. The rest of the
paper will expand upon this idea.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Earpiece Vibrations
Fig. 2 depicts the locations of earpieces in popular phone
models such as iPhone-12, Google Pixel 4a, and Samsung
Galaxy S4. The vibrations of the earpiece are much smaller
than that of loudspeakers. Therefore, the users need to place
their ears in direct contact with the earpiece to be able to
hear the sound clearly. Because of direct physical contact,
the sound waves propagate directly from one solid surface
(earpiece) to another solid surface (ears), thus providing a high
quality sound reception within human ears in comparison to
the case where there is no physical contact with the earpiece.
As a result, the leakage of the earpiece vibrations over the air
is also much weaker compared to that of a loudspeaker.
However, mmSpy uses reflections of mmWave signals to
directly track the vibrations produced by the earpiece. The

signals are frequency-modulated signals, the reflected com-
ponents will also be frequency modulated signals. However,
because they are delayed, at any given point in time, there is
a constant frequency difference between the transmitted and
reflected chirp as depicted in Fig. 3(b). By computing the
frequency difference ∆F between the transmitted and received
chirps, the distance of the reflecting object can be computed.
The below equation precisely converts the frequency differ-
ence into the range (r) of the object from the radar.

earpiece vibrations will also induce vibrations in the body
of the phone. mmSpy detects vibrations from the back of
the phone which is not facing the user’s ears. This enables
eavesdropping of earpiece vibrations even if the leakage of
sound over the air is significantly weaker. We next elaborate
