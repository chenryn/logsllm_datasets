**Table 4: Discovered and Confirmed New Watering Holes**

- **cartercenter.org** is counted twice due to two distinct watering hole attacks.
- **Discovery Types**:
  - **NN**: New attack and new website (both unreported).
  - **PN**: Previously reported attack, new website.
  - **PP**: Both attack and website previously reported.
- **Alexa Ranks**: Global and local ranks are provided when available.
- **NGO**: Non-Government Organization, typically run by citizens.
- **#Comp**: Number of compromises found.
- **Starred Domains**: Running Apache servers two years behind in updates.

**Summary of Discoveries and Campaigns**

Tables 4 and 5 summarize the discovered new watering holes and their corresponding campaigns. We report two types of discoveries:
1. **New Attack and New Watering Hole Instance**: Both the attack and the website are unreported.
2. **New Instance for a Known Attack/Campaign**: The attack is known, but the website is new, e.g., the "ScanBox" campaign.

A campaign refers to a group of attack instances characterized by specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as URL patterns, domain names, and compromise dates. For "ScanBox," attribution to a single attack is not possible, as explained later. Compromise dates and lifetimes are calculated based on available data, which may be a lower bound due to gaps in the collected snapshots.

**Key Findings**

- **Popular Targets**: Nearly half of the discovered watering holes are popular NGOs, particularly those focused on human rights and freedom of speech. These websites are prime targets for nation-state actors, who aim to target specific groups, such as dissidents.
- **Long Lifetimes**: Many NGO watering holes are compromised multiple times and for extended periods, e.g., rsf-chinese.org was compromised for 6 months.
- **Security Issues**: Two NGO websites (starred in Table 4) are running outdated Apache servers, which is a significant security risk. Similar issues were found on adpl.org.hk and cfr.org.

**Industry-Specific Watering Holes**

We also discovered industry-specific watering holes targeting employees and clients of certain sectors. These compromises rarely last long, similar to other reported watering holes like iphone-devsdk.com, forbes.com, and anthem.com. The "ScanBox" framework is the most prevalent tool used in these attacks.

**Intermediaries Used in Compromises**

Compromises often involve HTTP requests to external destinations, including exploit servers, C&C, redirectors, etc. These intermediaries fall into three categories:
- **Legitimate Domains**: Compromised to host malicious payloads.
- **Malicious Domains**: Directly used for malicious purposes.
- **DDNS and URL Shorteners**: Used to avoid detection and bypass security systems.

A rising trend is the use of legitimate domains, which helps in avoiding detection and bypassing enterprise security mechanisms. Additionally, we observed the purchase and use of intermediaries that mimic the watering-holed domains, e.g., scdusa.com (watering hole) vs. usascd.com (intermediary) and jquery.com (watering hole) vs. jquery-cdn.com (intermediary).

**In-Depth Analysis of New Cases**

This section provides an in-depth analysis of newly discovered watering hole cases, helping to better understand APT actors' motivations, strategies, and techniques. We explore three politically oriented watering hole attacks, including a recent one targeting Chinese dissidents. We also analyze a group of watering holes using the reconnaissance framework "ScanBox" and partially infiltrate a live attack to redirect traffic to our sinkhole.

**JSONP Campaign**

One of the biggest findings is a new watering hole attack confirmed by our industry partner and reported by various media outlets. Specifically, RSF-chinese.org, a website for the Association of Reporters Without Borders in China, was compromised on January 12th, 2015. The site loaded an external script from psw.pw, which collected Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from visitors by exploiting JSONP vulnerabilities in popular Chinese sites. This attack aimed to spy on visitors without delivering malware, collecting information stealthily during visits. The compromise lasted for 6 months until it was cleaned following our reporting.
