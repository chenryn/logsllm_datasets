Table 4: 17 Discovered and conﬁrmed new watering holes, cartercenter.org is counted twice as two disparate watering hole attacks were discovered. Discovery type can be a new
attack and new website (NN) where both are unreported, the attack has been reported previously but the discovered website has not (PN) or both the attack and website have been
reported (PP). Alexa glabal/Local(i.e. country speciﬁc) ranks are shown when available. NGO refers to a Non government organization that is usually run by citizens. #Comp
indicates the number of compromises found. Starred domains are running Apache servers that are two years behind in their updates.
Tables 4 and 5 summarize all discovered new watering holes and
their corresponding campaigns. We report two types of discover-
ies, a new attack and subsequently a new watering hole instance or
a new instance for a previously known attack/campaign, e.g.
the
“ScanBox” campaign. A campaign here refers to a group of attack
instances all characterized by a set of Indicators of Compromise
(IoCs), such as URL patterns, domain name and compromised date,
etc., with the exception of “ScanBox” which cannot be attributed
to one attack, as explained later. Further, compromise dates and
lifetimes are calculated for both watering holes and campaigns, de-
pending on available data, which can only be considered as a lower
bound for the times the attacks lasted since the archive has gaps
(missing data) in the collected snapshots.
Overall, almost half of the discovered watering holes are popu-
lar None-Government Organizations (NGOs) mostly about human
rights and the freedom of speech. These types of websites are prime
targets for nation state actors, i.e. government sponsored, targeting
a speciﬁc niche of people, e.g. dissidents. Such a claim is supported
by our ﬁndings, shown in Table 4, where many NGO watering holes
keep getting compromised multiple times. Moreover, their compro-
mises last for a long time, e.g. 6 months for rsf-chinese.org (until
the publicity of our work stopped it).
Of particular interest is one website, cartercenter.org, a human
rights organization, which had been strategically compromised at
least 5 times starting with the ever so popular “VOHO” campaign [29]
in 2012. Two of the watering hole attacks have never been reported
before but did not last for long and have been quickly cleaned up.
The ﬁfth attack, appeared in late 2014, is not in the table as it does
not show up in our dataset but had been reported to us by our indus-
try partner and we found its URLs ﬂagged in the CleanMX virus
watch [13].
To ﬁnd out the reason behind such frequent compromise and long
lifetimes, we ran Sucuri [11] to understand the security protection
of the web servers used to host the websites. Sucuri [11] is a remote
website malware and security scanner that checks the status of a
website before a user visits it. We found that two of NGO websites,
starred in Table 4, are actually running an Apache server that is two
years behind in its updates. The same security issue (without being
updated for two years) has also been discovered on two other NGO
websites, adpl.org.hk and cfr.org.
In addition to NGO watering holes, we discovered industry spe-
ciﬁc watering holes targeting employees and clients of certain sec-
tors. Their compromises, however, rarely last for long, just like
what has been reported about other watering holes, such as iphone-
devsdk.com, forbes.com and anthem.com. Additionally, the “Scan-
Box” framework is found to be the most prevalent tool utilized by
this type of watering holes.
Used Intermediaries. Oftentimes, compromises contain HTTP re-
quests to external destinations such as exploit servers, C&C, redi-
rectors, etc., which we call intermediaries. In the collective set of
conﬁrmed watering holes, we found that the intermediaries used
fall in three categories: legitimate domains, malicious domains or
using DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name System) and URL shortners.
A rising trend that we observe is the use of legitimate domains,
which are compromised to host malicious payloads and serve them
to visitors of watering holes. Such use of legitimate domains helps
in avoiding detection and bypassing security systems, particularly
the protection mechanisms employed at enterprises, where newly
registered domains are usually a red ﬂag. Additionally, we ob-
served the purchase and use of intermediaries that are similar to
the watering-holed domains, e.g scdusa.com (watering hole) vs.
usascd.com (intermediary) & jquery.com (watering hole) vs. jquery-
cdn.com (intermediary). Further, we checked the PassiveDNS pro-
vided by the Security Information Exchange [4] for the trafﬁc re-
ceived by the legitimate domains around their compromise dates.
Speciﬁcally, we found that the watering hole procommons.org.hk
contained links to the legitimate domain hotel365.co.kr, a Korean
hotel ranked 891K by Alexa [21]; the site (hotel365.co.kr) was
compromised from August to September 2013 according to our
dataset and the PassiveDNS shows that it received 17.15 visits daily
during the compromise, well above an average of 5.9 visits when it
was clean.

litically oriented watering hole attacks, including a very recent one
where Chinese dissidents were targeted and spied on. Additionally,
we analyze a group of watering holes employing a reconnaissance
framework dubbed ScanBox. Finally, we partially inﬁltrate one
live attack and redirect trafﬁc to our sinkhole to ﬁnd more watering
holes.
JSONP Campaign. One of the biggest ﬁndings made in our study
is a new watering hole attack that happened recently. This dis-
covery was conﬁrmed by our industry partner and along the chain
picked up by many media outlets [23, 58, 51, 64]. Speciﬁcally,
RSF-chinese.org, a website for the Associate of reporters without
borders in China, was detected by Eyeson to be compromised and
loading an external script on January 12th, 2015. A close look at
the site reveals that one of its embedded JavaScripts was infected
with a script tag inclusion to get an external malicious JavaScript
from psw.pw, detailed in Table 6. The malicious script, delivered
only when the referral is the watering hole, serves the purposes
of ﬁnding the real identity of the visitors to RSF-chinese.org by
collecting their Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII): PII such
as real name, DOB, address, phone number which is gathered by
exploiting JSONP vulnerabilities [14, 32] within popular Chinese
sites such as baidu.com, sina.com.cn, qq.com, qunar.com, 58.com,
etc when the victim has already logged into those sites. JSONP
is a technique that allows cross domain requests over the script
tag bypassing the CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) rules.
In this attack, JSONP is used to leak data from vulnerable JSONP
services by submitting requests to get logged in user proﬁles, ex-
amples of some URLs used are shown in Table 6. Additionally, the
script attempts to ﬁnd out the real IP address used by the victim
and whether she is using TOR, VPN or other proxies. Amusingly,
the script even includes the comments about some of its code snip-
pets. A more detailed report about the attack speciﬁcs has been
published by AlienVault [23].
The compromise on RSF-chinese.org lasted for 6 months until
it was cleaned as a result of our reporting. What is remarkable
about this new watering hole is its sole purpose of spying on the
website visitors. Unlike other APT attacks, malware has not been
delivered to the visitor’s system, and only her information was col-
lected stealthily during the visit. It is also worth noting that this is
