##### Description of the problem
When using webpack and babel in compiled code I see a lot of duplicated code
mostly because of inconsistent import paths, so some modules are imported more
than once.

For eg. `Matrix4` is imported twice and it takes a lot of space. I'll
investigate it further, it may be mainly problem with loaders I took from
examples. Because some of them import directly modules (how it should be done
to minify output bundle) and some import the modules from `src/three.js` what
causes importing everything.  
These are all three imports in my project:
