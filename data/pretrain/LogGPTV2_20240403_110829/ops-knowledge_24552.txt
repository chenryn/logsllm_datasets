User: I have just installed Python on my Windows 7. I thought that after that I will be able to run python on the command prompt but it is not the case. After the installation I also found out that I can run the python command shell. This is nice. But what should I do if I want to save my program in a file and then I want to run this program (in Linux, for example, I typed "python file_name.py" in the command line).
Assistant: You need to update your environment variables to include the path to the Python executable. 
On XP you can do this by right clicking on "My Computer" -> Properties and then going to the "Advanced" tab.
