After installing Python on your Windows 7 system, you may find that you cannot directly run Python from the command prompt. However, you can still use the Python command shell, which is a good start. If you wish to save your program in a file and then execute it, similar to how you would type `python file_name.py` in a Linux environment, you need to add Python to your system's environment variables.

Hereâ€™s how you can do this:

1. **Locate the Python Installation Directory:**
   - Find where Python is installed. The default location is usually `C:\PythonXX`, where `XX` is the version number (e.g., `C:\Python39` for Python 3.9).

2. **Access Environment Variables:**
   - Right-click on "Computer" or "This PC" on your desktop or in the Start menu.
   - Select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings."
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

3. **Edit the Path Variable:**
   - In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section and select it. Click "Edit."
   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New" and add the path to the Python executable directory (e.g., `C:\Python39`).
   - Also, add the path to the Scripts directory (e.g., `C:\Python39\Scripts`), as this will allow you to run additional Python tools and scripts.
   - Click "OK" to close all the windows.

4. **Verify the Setup:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version displayed.
   - Now, you can create a Python script (e.g., `file_name.py`) and run it by typing `python file_name.py` in the Command Prompt.

By following these steps, you will be able to run Python scripts from the command line on your Windows 7 system.
