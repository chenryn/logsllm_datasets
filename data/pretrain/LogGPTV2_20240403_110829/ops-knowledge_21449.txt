User: I'm starting to learn python and loving it. I work on a Mac mainly as well as Linux. I'm finding that on Linux (Ubuntu 9.04 mostly) when I install a python module using apt-get it works fine. I can import it with no trouble.
On the Mac, I'm used to using Macports to install all the Unixy stuff. However, I'm finding that most of the python modules I install with it are not being seen by python. I've spent some time playing around with PATH settings and using python_select . Nothing has really worked and at this point I'm not really understanding, instead I'm just poking around.
I get the impression that Macports isn't universally loved for managing python modules. I'd like to start fresh using a more "accepted" (if that's the right word) approach. 
So, I was wondering, what is the method that Mac python developers use to manage their modules?
Bonus questions: 
Do you use Apple's python, or some other version?
Do you compile everything from source or is there a package manger that works well (Fink?).
Assistant: If you use Python from MacPorts, it has it's own easy_install located at: /opt/local/bin/easy_install-2.6 (for py26, that is). It's not the same one as simply calling easy_install directly, even if you used python_select to change your default python command.
