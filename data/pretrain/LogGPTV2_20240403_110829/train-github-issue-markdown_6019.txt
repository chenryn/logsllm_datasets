The pull request to allow injecting ENV parameters introduced an issue when
building the container.
When a container is merged, the `mergeEnvPlaceholders` will duplicate existing
placeholders. In a local project, where I had 9 `env()` parameters, this meant
that the first 3 were duplicated 32768 times. Later when the compiler calls
`resolveEnvPlaceholders` it will loop through all of these impacting
performance pretty badly.
I think the problem is that using `array_merge_recursive` will append
duplicate values of nested arrays if the keys are numeric. I've never
contributed to Symfony before so I'm not sure on this one, but I don't know if
it needs to be fully recursive given that the environment placeholders should
be scalar values.
If it really does need to be recursive then something like the function
mentioned in the comments for the `array_merge_recursive` docs page could be
used. I did a simple performance check (microtime) for one of the compiler
passes that was slowing down (ContainerBuilderDebugDumpPass)
    0.023882150650024 # with the function from the comments in the php docs
    16.744822025299 # as it is now
    0.023157119750977 # with only one level merge
I'll create a pull request using the simple merge and see what you think.
I guess this won't affect anything before v3.2
