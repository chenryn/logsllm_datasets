There are three impls in int-template.rs and uint-template.rs that apply to
all numeric types. Until recently, if you tried to do this:
    import int::num;
    import i8::num;
you'd receive "error: duplicate definition of type num". `d14d415` fixed this
for the particular case of the `num` impl, but trying to duplicate the process
for the `eq` and `ord` impls gives weird errors in libstd/sort.rs that I'm
hoping the resolve rewrite will, er, resolve. It won't be possible to
automatically export the `eq` and `ord` impls on numeric types until this is
fixed.
