User: I don't have access to gcc on my shared hosting provider (Hostgator), so when I try to install mysql-python from within a virtualenv using pip install MySQL-python, I get unable to execute gcc: Permission denied. Is there another way to install the MySQL-python library in my virtualenv?
Assistant: There is the option for virtualenv of --system-site-packages which will "Give access to the global site-packages modules to the virtual environment."  If the parent host already has the mysql-python module installed, it will use that.
