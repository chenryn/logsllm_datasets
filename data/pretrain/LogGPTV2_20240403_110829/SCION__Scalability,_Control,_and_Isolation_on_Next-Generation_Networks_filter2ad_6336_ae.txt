of network nodes (since it involves all-to-all communication).
In SCION on the other hand, all route updates (the path
construction beacons) originate directly from the destination
AD via the route servers of the TD. There is no global dis-
tributed consistency issue since the route servers are centrally
administered. Since all route discovery occurs in an upstream-
to-downstream direction, frequent updates can be done highly
scalably (O(k ·n) communication per update) in a coordinated
fashion. Hence, published routes can have very short timeouts
and be updated frequently and securely.

X. EVALUATION
Due to the infeasibility of evaluating a completely new
architecture on the current Internet, we have constructed an
AD topology based on real-world datasets to evaluate the
effectiveness of SCION. Speciﬁcally, we simulate SCION on
a measured Internet AD topology annotated with the business
relationships from a CAIDA dataset1 to evaluate the routing
efﬁciency, security, and expressiveness.
A. Evaluation Methodology
Trust domains.
Given a measured AD topology from
CAIDA, we group the ADs into several trust domains and
assign some of the ADs as the TD Core ADs in order to
simulate SCION Trust-domain-based routing. In this proof-of-
concept evaluation, we virtually divide the Internet into ﬁve
local and non-overlapping trust domains, and each of these
ﬁve local TDs associates with one Regional Internet Registry
(RIR), the regional organization allocating AD numbers. In
other words, ADs registered to the same RIR belong to
the same trust domain in our experiment. Such a division
reﬂects the geographical and administrative relationships to
some extent. Table II summarizes the size of each of these trust
domains. The TD Core ADs are deﬁned as TD Core ADs that
have no providers themselves in their respective trust domain.
BGP Routing. When simulating BGP (and S-BGP) routing,
we assume that
in benign cases ADs respect and make
routing decisions based on the business relationships with their
neighbors, and then use path length as the tie-breaking factor.
We also assume that the TD Core ADs form a clique, and
thus the length of any inter TD Core routing path is 1. This
is accomplished by adding a peering link (if it does not yet
exist) between every pair of TD Core ADs.
Finding k up-paths.
In practice, each AD running SCION
can have different policies in determining which k paths to
the value of k, and the algorithm for ﬁnding the
export,
(presumably disjoint) k paths. However, the optimization of
the export policies, the k value, and the ﬁnding-disjoint-path
algorithm are outside the scope of this paper. Instead, for
the purpose of simulation, we implement a simple k-path
discovery algorithm that takes a source AD, the complete
AD-level topology, and a Trust Domain as inputs, and yields
a set of k maximally edge disjoint paths to the TD Core
ADs in the speciﬁed Trust Domain. Speciﬁcally, our k-up-path

discovery algorithm selects the disjoint paths using an iterative,
greedy algorithm. At step i, the greedy algorithm 1) ﬁnds the
current shortest path as the ith maximally disjoint path, and 2)
increases the weight of all the edges on the ith path such that
these edges become less preferred in the next iteration. Fig. 5
shows the distribution of the number of available paths. More
than 90% of ADs have fewer than 10 available paths in their
Trust Domain, which indicates that the Internet has a shallow
AD-level topology.
B. SCION Shortcut Efﬁcacy: Route Stretch
SCION uses shortcuts to reduce the route length; when the
source and destination endpoints have a common provider
or a common peering link, they can communicate directly
without traversing TD Core. In this experiment, we evaluate
the effectiveness of this shortcut mechanism in the intra-TD
routing using the end-to-end route stretch: the ratio of the
length of a SCION route to the length of a BGP route for
a given pair of source and destination endpoints. We focus
on routing within a TD which represents the common case
with fully protected route computation. Our simulation takes
1000 random pairs of source and destination ADs in the same
TD. For each pair, we measure the length of its BGP route
and SCION route. Table III summarizes the average length
of SCION paths and its stretch. The result demonstrates that
SCION paths only add a small amount of overhead in terms
of path length compared to BGP. Also, SCION paths become
shorter as k increases because endpoints are more likely to
ﬁnd a common AD or link for shortcut construction when
they have more up-paths.
C. Route Construction Efﬁcacy: Expressiveness
In SCION, route update is efﬁcient and scalable because
only the TD Cores need to announce their reachability infor-
mation, in contrast to path vector where every AD ﬂoods its
update to potentially every other AD in the Internet. However,
we are interested in knowing whether our gain in scalability
comes at the cost of path expressiveness compared to path
vector.
In this experiment, we show that given SCION’s well-
isolated TD infrastructure, a route discovered by BGP-style
(i.e., ﬂooding) route updates is likely to be found through
SCION’s scalable route update propagation as well. Specif-
ically we deﬁne trust-scoped expressiveness as the fraction
of source and destination pairs whose “trusted” BGP path is
discoverable in SCION. “Trusted” BGP paths are intra-domain
paths or inter-domain paths that pass through the TD Core.
The evaluation proceeds as follows: we randomly select
1000 pairs of source and destination ADs in the same TD.
For every pair, we compute the trusted BGP path between
the pair as well as the SCION up-paths of the source and the
destination ADs, and check whether the BGP path between the
pair is contained (i.e., in the union of the source’s up-paths
and the destination’s down-paths). The ratio of contained paths
represents the expressiveness. We evaluate the expressiveness
as a function of k based on our simple k-path selection
algorithm to demonstrate the practicability of SCION and the
trend as k increases. Fig. 6 summarizes the results of SCION’s
expressiveness experiments, from which we can see that with
only a k = 5, SCION can already capture more than 85% of
BGP paths.
D. Security
Section IX discussed attacks that are naturally infeasible
in SCION. In this section, we quantitatively investigate how
severe such attacks are in networks lacking our well-deﬁned
properties. As an example, we consider the impact of trafﬁc at-
traction attacks where the attacker attempts to attract routes by
announcing a non-existing shortcut (or “wormhole”). Clearly,
with SCION’s strong isolation property, it is infeasible for an
outsider to pull trafﬁc out of a TD, whereas in a network
without
trust-based isolation, a wormhole residing in any
corner of the Internet can possibly attract a signiﬁcant portion
of trafﬁc and eavesdrop on unencrypted communication.
In the simulation, a group of colluding ADs (except the TD
Core ADs that we assume trusted) announce a link with min-
imum cost between each other to attract trafﬁc. We consider
