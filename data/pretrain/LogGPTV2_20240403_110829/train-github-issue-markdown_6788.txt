**Current behavior**  
I have two tags select bound to the same list, after changing the selection a
couple times I can see items from the first select being overridden by the
second select selection.  
This happens when I was testing bindings types on _select_ with _ngValue_ ,
_value_ and a _change_ event.
**Expected behavior**  
The list instance should not change.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
This behavior seems ramdom, you'll need to change selection in both drop down
a couple times before both select start containing only one duplicated object.  
Here is a plunker on version 2.4.7:
