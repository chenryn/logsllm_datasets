User: How do I get a pip shim in ~/.pyenv/shims. I am using pyenv, but which pip still shows the system version of pip.
Based on the below comment copied from the docs, it appears it should occur through rehashing, but I have run pyenv rehash and nothing happen happens
Copied from docs:
Through a process called rehashing, pyenv maintains shims in that directory to match every Python command across every installed version of Pythonâ€”python, pip, and so on.
Per request in comments here is my PATH
/Users/patrick/google-cloud-sdk/bin:/Users/patrick/.pyenv/shims:/Users/patrick/.pyenv/bin:/Users/patrick/.local/bin:/Users/patrick/npm/bin:/Users/patrick/google_appengine:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/mongodb/bin
and here is my ~/.pyenv/shims content:

$ ll ~/.pyenv/shims/

Assistant: All of the shim files actually seem to be identical, so you should always be able to do cp ~/.pyenv/shims/{python,pip}.
