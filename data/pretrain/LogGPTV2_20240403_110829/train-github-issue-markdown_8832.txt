Hey,
This is just feedback really, but the map progress that used to display at the
top of the map page with each section and how far you were through was really
handy because you could quickly see which sections you still needed to do and
how far through the challenges you were on each section and overall.
In the new map layout you have to expand each section and scroll through to
see which checkpoints are not ticked off, which is more time consuming and it
is easy to miss the odd one.
It makes it harder to know how far you have progressed.
