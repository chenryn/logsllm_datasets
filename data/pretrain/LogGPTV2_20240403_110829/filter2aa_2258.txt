Lair
What is Lair
• Web application for managing and tracking 
the execution of network assessments

comprehensive, systematic pentest
• Open-source project sponsored by FishNet 
Security 
• Imports , aggregates, and normalizes output 
from automated tools
Why is it different?
• Updates pushed to distributed testers in near 
real-time (really real-time, no really)
– Reduces duplication of effort
• Workflow
• Status tracking
– Enhances information sharing
• Credentials/hashes found
• Manually identified vulnerabilities
• Successful exploitation
• False positives
• Screenshots
– Team Instant Messaging
Technology
• Web application built on Node.js and Meteor
– Simplifies real-time synchronization of information 
across multiple, distributed clients
– Pub/sub concept
– No need to fight web sockets
• Python used for Drones
