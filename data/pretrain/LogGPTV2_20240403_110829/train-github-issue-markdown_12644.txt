### System Information
- **OpenCV Version:** 4.1.0
- **Operating Systems:**
  - Linux Ubuntu 18.04
  - Windows 7

### Detailed Description
I have successfully trained a YOLO object detection model using Darknet and verified the results with the following command:
```bash
./darknet detector test cfg/obj.data cfg/yolo-obj.cfg yolo.weights data/test.jpg
```

However, when I attempt to use the DNN module in OpenCV to display the results on an input image of size `160x30`, the process fails. The DNN module works correctly for larger images, such as those with dimensions `1280x760`.

#### Input Image

I suspect that the `blobFromImage` function is cropping the upper region of the image, leading to incorrect results for the input image.

For reference, here is an example of an image that was processed correctly by the DNN module:

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Train a YOLO object detection model using Darknet.
2 .Verify the results using the Darknet command provided above.
3. Use the DNN module in OpenCV to process an input image of size `160x30`.
4. Observe the failure in displaying the correct results.
5. Test the DNN module with a larger image (e.g., `1280x760`) and observe the correct results.
