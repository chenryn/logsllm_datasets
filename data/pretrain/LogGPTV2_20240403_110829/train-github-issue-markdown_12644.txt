##### Detailed description
I have trained YOLO object detection via darknet and I could check result
using  
`./darknet detector test cfg/obj.data cfg/yolo-obj.cfg yolo.weights
data/test.jpg`  
but when I want to use dnn module in OpenCV for showing result on input
image(`160*30`), it failed. But it could show result correctly for larger
images such `1280*760`.

I think that, `blobfromimage` function crop upper region of this image and
subsequently show incorrect results for input image.
At last I show a sample of image that showed correctly by this module:
