**Title: Botconf2018 - APT Attack against the Middle East: The Big Bang**

In recent weeks, we have identified a resurgence of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign targeting the Middle East, with a particular focus on the Palestinian Authority. This APT group initiated their campaign over a year ago, but there has been minimal public visibility of their activities since then. The renewed "Big Bang" campaign demonstrates enhanced capabilities, broader functionalities, and a more robust offensive infrastructure. It also appears to be highly targeted, with specific entities in mind.

The characteristics and malware features of this campaign share significant similarities with those attributed to the Gaza Cybergang, which emerged in 2017 and 2018. These shared traits strongly suggest that the same notorious threat group is behind this latest attack. Despite undergoing substantial upgrades over the past year, the APT group has maintained distinct and recognizable fingerprints. Both the delivery methods and the malicious artifacts contain unique traces that allow us to connect the current wave of attacks to previous incidents.

The APT group employs a variety of sophisticated techniques, including:
- **Fake News Websites:** These sites feature up-to-date articles designed to lure victims.
- **Phishing Emails:** Well-crafted emails with malicious attachments or embedded links.
- **Malicious Mobile Applications:** Apps disguised as legitimate services, aimed at filtering in targeted victims who meet specific criteria and leading them to custom reconnaissance malware.

During our investigation, we identified only three instances of the renewed operation. However, distinctive characteristics in the command and control (C2) websites revealed a larger, potentially undiscovered infrastructure that may support additional, unknown samples. Our analysis has focused on the malware's capabilities, and we are confident that this is part of an ongoing, multi-staged attack. The full infection chain has not yet been fully realized.

The campaign was named "Big Bang" due to the authors' apparent fondness for the popular TV series "The Big Bang Theory," as evidenced by the use of character names from the show in their function naming conventions. Additionally, the malware code includes references to actors from the Turkish series "Resurrection: Ertugrul."

In our presentation, we will delve into the operations of this APT group, highlighting the recent enhancements and tactics, as well as the Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) that have been used to identify this group in both past and present attacks.
