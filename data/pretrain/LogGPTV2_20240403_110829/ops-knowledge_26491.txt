User: According to the following requirements, design an elastic computing solution to ensure that the system remains stable and efficient during business peaks. An e-commerce company needs to cope with the pressure of a large number of user visits during promotional activities such as Double 11 and 618 every year. During the peak period of business, the daily visits to the website will increase from the usual millions to tens of millions, and the number of requests per second will increase from the usual hundreds to thousands. Also, the main pages that users visit are the shopping cart, order, payment, etc. pages.
Assistant: 1. Development of elastic computing solutions - Do a good job of troubleshooting system bottlenecks, regularly check the status of system resources, and optimize the internal technical architecture of the system to improve stability and response speed; - Introduce cloud computing technology to convert the code of the website And data is stored on the server of the cloud service provider, and the elastic computing function of the cloud is used to realize automatic scaling; - The load balancing and automatic expansion function of the cloud technology is used to solve the peak problem of large traffic. During the peak period of business, according to the workflow and characteristics of the website, install and configure the necessary software on the server side, reserve sufficient server resources and computing resources, and realize cluster expansion. Outdated virtual machines and containers should be scaled down in time to achieve efficient resource utilization; - Use the database read-write separation and data caching mechanism to manage user data and website information. Minimize the pressure on the main database and improve database performance and reliability; - Use efficient CDN caching technology to speed up user access and ease the burden on the server; - Do a good job in data backup and recovery to ensure the security and integrity of system data . 2. Test of elastic computing solution - simulate test of business peak period, simulate a large number of users accessing the website at the same time, test the response speed of the page, and check the reliability and elasticity of the system; It can meet the business demand in the peak period and determine the limit capacity of the system; - Conduct drills and emergency response drills for elastic computing solutions to ensure that the system can still provide reliable services in the face of attacks and extreme situations, and protect the security of user data and the company Interests. 3. Deployment and operation and maintenance of elastic computing solutions - formulate a plan for system failures and risks, establish a monitoring and early warning mechanism, conduct regular system inspections and safety inspections, and avoid emergencies; Unified management of computing resources ensures the normal operation of the business, monitors system performance indicators and log files, and handles abnormal events in a timely manner; - Plans and manages system updates and upgrades to minimize the impact on business. Monitor the operation of system services in real time, and strengthen the daily maintenance and investigation of applications.
