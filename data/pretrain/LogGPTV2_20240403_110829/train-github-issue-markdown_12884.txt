# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Currently it is not possible to display two separate Next.js-based
applications on the same page, if one attemps to do so, he gets an error. It
is caused by the fact that Next.js-based application mounts on DOM elements
with fixed IDs: `__next` and `__NEXT_DATA__`.
## Describe the solution you'd like
We'd like IDs of elements on which Next.js-based application mounts to be
parameterized, possibly provided in application build script. We've forked
Next.js and implemented this change in our fork: Raudos@`a4da2b6`. This PoC
was created during workshop at meet.js in Katowice, Poland on 29.09.2019
(https://summit.meetjs.pl/2019/zeit-workshop).
## Describe alternatives you've considered
We've considered not having multiple separate Next.js-based applications on
one page, but we're building our application in microfrontend architecture,
hence in many cases we want to avoid having whole page as a single
application.
## Additional context
More information on our approach to microfrontend architecture can be found
here: https://medium.com/stepstone-tech/microfrontends-extending-service-
oriented-architecture-to-frontend-development-part-1-120b71c87b68 (we've not
considered Next.js at the time of writing this article).
