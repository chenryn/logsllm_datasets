### True Function and Network Analysis

#### IP Networks and Connections
The theoretical underpinnings of IP networks include the rules governing network capacity and connectivity. For example, if a router fails, it can significantly impact the network topology. Cutset analysis is a method used to evaluate the impact of such failures. The idea behind cutset analysis is to identify and remove specific components (such as links or routers) from the network, thereby isolating parts of the network that become unusable.

1. **Cutset Analysis**:
   - **Objective**: To determine the effect of removing two components (e.g., a router and a link) from the network.
   - **Process**: After removing these components, the remaining network is checked for functionality. If the network remains functional, the value of the structure function is computed. If not, the components are considered critical.
   - **Outcome**: This analysis helps in identifying failure events and the access routers affected by them.

#### Failure Events and Access Routers
Assume a generic on/off process for the system with components \(i\) and \(j\). The downtime durations \(T_{ij}\) and the mean values \(E\{T_{ij}\}\) are given by Equations (3), respectively. The distribution of the uptime \(T_i\) and downtime \(T_{ij}\) are Pareto distributed, with parameters \(m_i\) and \(\alpha_i\).

- **Pareto Distribution**:
  - \(T_i \sim \text{Pareto}(m_i, \alpha_i)\)
  - \(Y_i = 1 / E(T_i)\)

For each pair of components \(\{i, j\}\), we consider all two-component failures and list all access routers that lose their local IP availability due to these failures. This information is then used to compute the local IP availability for each access router.

#### On/Off Process Model for Local IP Availability
We model the local IP availability at each access router using an on/off process. The following assumptions are made:
1. There are no three-component failures.
2. Joint failure events are independent.

The period lengths of the on/off process are determined by the minimum of exponentially distributed random variables. For \(k\) two-component failures affecting an access router, the duration of on-time is given by:
\[ T_{\text{onacc}} = \min(T_{J1}, T_{J2}, \ldots, T_{Jk}) \sim \text{Exp} \left( \sum_{l=1}^k \lambda_l \right) \]

The probability of the router being off is:
\[ P(\text{offacc} > t) = \sum_{l=1}^k \lambda_l P(T_{Jl} > t) \]

#### Case Study: Funet Backbone Network
As a case study, we apply our modeling to the Funet backbone network, whose topology and link loads are publicly available.

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Funet pings its 6 core routers and customer sites to monitor the network and detect failures.
   - Data cover the period from August 1, 2000, to July 31, 2007, and include 255 unplanned core router failures.

2. **Modeling Downtimes**:
   - We use the mean excess function (MEF) to characterize the tail behavior of downtimes.
   - The MEF for small \(u\) is calculated as \(e(u) = E(X - u | X > u)\).
   - The MEF plots indicate heavy-tailed distributions, suggesting the use of the Pareto distribution.

3. **Quantile-Quantile Plots**:
   - Q-Q plots of downtime durations against the Pareto distribution show a good fit.
   - The shape parameter of the Pareto distribution is estimated to be 2.3, implying infinite third moments.

4. **Uptime Analysis**:
   - Uptime durations are modeled using an exponential distribution.
   - The estimated mean uptime duration is approximately 872 hours.

#### Component Models
The Poisson-Pareto on-off model for router reliability is supported by the analysis of Funet's ping data. For link failures, we derive models by scaling the router model. The minimum downtime duration is set to 60 seconds, and the shape parameter is estimated based on the limited data.

#### Local IP-Availability Frequency Curves
We build on-off processes for each access router according to the previous section. The frequency curves provide the unavailability of IP access. The base 10 logarithm of the probability that the ongoing failure exceeds \(t\) minutes is shown on the y-axis. For \(t = 0\), this represents the downtime availability.

- **Curves**:
  - The best access routers have the highest availability.
  - The lowest category includes routers in northern Finland, which are less reliable due to longer link lengths.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the network's resilience and the impact of component failures on IP availability.
