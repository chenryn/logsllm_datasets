### Issue Type:
Problem with SSL Verification

### Ansible Version:
`ansible 1.5.2`  
Installed via pip

### Environment:
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 12.04

### Summary:
I am encountering an SSL verification error when attempting to fetch URLs via HTTPS using Ansible.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ansible -i 127.0.0.1, "*" -m 'get_url' -a 'url="https://www.postgresql.org" dest=/tmp/x'
   ```

### Expected Results:
The file should be downloaded successfully to `/tmp/x`.

### Actual Results:
The command fails with the following error message:
```json
127.0.0.1 | FAILED >> {
    "failed": true,
    "msg": "Failed to validate the SSL certificate for www.postgresql.org:443. You can use validate_certs=no, however this is unsafe and not recommended '/usr/share/ca-certificates/cacert.org/cacert.org.crt'"
}
```

### Additional Information:
- The script detected some certificates in `/usr/share/ca-certificates/cacert.org/cacert.org.crt`.
- It failed to verify the PostgreSQL certificate.
- Any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated.
