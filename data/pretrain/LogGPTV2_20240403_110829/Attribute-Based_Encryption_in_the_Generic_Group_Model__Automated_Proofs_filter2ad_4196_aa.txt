ABSTRACT
A(cid:139)ribute-based encryption (ABE) is a cryptographic primitive which
supports (cid:128)ne-grained access control on encrypted data, making
it an appealing building block for many applications. In this pa-
per, we propose, implement, and evaluate fully automated methods
for proving security of ABE in the Generic Bilinear Group Model
(Boneh, Boyen, and Goh, 2005, Boyen, 2008), an idealized model
which admits simpler and more e(cid:129)cient constructions, and can
also be used to (cid:128)nd a(cid:139)acks. Our method is applicable to Rational-
Fraction Induced ABE, a large class of ABE that contains most of the
schemes from the literature, and relies on a Master (cid:145)eorem, which
reduces security in the GGM to a (new) notion of symbolic security,
which is amenable to automated veri(cid:128)cation using constraint-based
techniques. We relate our notion of symbolic security for Rational-
Fraction Induced ABE to prior notions for Pair Encodings. Finally,
we present several applications, including automated proofs for
new schemes.

1 INTRODUCTION
Computer-aided cryptography [18] is an emerging approach that
advocates using automated tools based on formal methods for ana-
lyzing the security of cryptographic schemes and their implemen-
tation. (cid:145)e high level of assurance provided by computer-aided
cryptography is particularly important for cryptographic schemes
that are already deployed in real-world systems, such as RSA-OAEP
and TLS, but also for schemes that are required in many applica-
tions and hold the promise of widespread deployment. One such

example is provided by A(cid:139)ribute-Based Encryption [41, 58], a novel
form of public-key encryption. ABE supports (cid:128)ne-grained access
control on encrypted data, and has many applications including
electronic medical records [9], messaging systems [50], online so-
cial networks [15] and information-centric networking [44]. (cid:145)ese
applications make ABE an ideal application domain for computer-
aided cryptography.
Approach. In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate
automated methods for proving security of ABE in the Generic
(Bilinear) Group Model, an idealized model de(cid:128)ned in [28, 32] for
analyzing the security of cryptographic assumptions and pairing-
based schemes. While we do not advocate proving security in the
GGM over the standard model, there are several reasons for our
approach. First, the GGM captures most algebraic a(cid:139)acks, making
automated analysis in the GGM desirable for providing cryptog-
raphers early feedback during the design of new constructions.
Second, the Generic Group Model o(cid:137)en admits schemes that are
simpler, more e(cid:129)cient, and ultimately more likely to be deployed
in real-world systems. (cid:145)ird, existing proofs of adaptive security of
ABE in the standard model are very challenging and full automation
remains beyond the state-of-the-art, despite recent progress [24].
In contrast, there exists a promising line of work [10, 20] that devel-
ops fully automated tools for proving security in the GGM. Finally,
GGM proofs are generally considered to be fairly mechanical and
sometimes claims are made without proofs, e.g. [43, footnote 1
(Chapter 6)]; this makes GGM proofs a useful target and test-bed
for automated proofs.
Concretely, we introduce the class of Rational-Fraction Induced
ABE, which includes many constructions from the literature, and
prove for every ABE in this class that their security in the GGM is
equivalent to security in a symbolic model, where the experiments
are purely algebraic. (cid:145)en, we introduce a notion of symbolic secu-
rity for RFI-ABE, and prove that every symbolically secure RFI-ABE
is secure in the symbolic model. Leveraging the fact that symbolic
security su(cid:129)ces to conclude security of a Rational-Fraction Induced
ABE in the GGM, we develop a constraint-solving method for prov-
ing symbolic security. Informally, the constraint-solving method
can automatically (dis)prove the existence of solutions for systems
of (in)equations between rational fractions. We implement the
constraint-solving method and use it to evaluate several schemes,
including schemes from the literature, various new schemes of in-
dependent interest, and some subtly insecure schemes. Our tool
(cid:128)nds automated proofs for most constructions, and a(cid:139)acks for the
insecure schemes.

(Type III) bilinear groups, with a pairing function e : G1×G2 → GT ,
where G1 , G2, and GT are prime order groups. (cid:145)is se(cid:139)ing is a
natural choice to consider because it supports more e(cid:129)cient and
compact implementations.
Outline of contributions. For the clarity of exposition, we
distinguish between new results about security of ABE in the GGM,
and new results about automated proofs in the GGM. However, we
stress that our main contribution resides precisely in developing an
approach that is rigorously justi(cid:128)ed and is amenable to automated
veri(cid:128)cation.
ABE. In ABE, ciphertexts are associated with descriptive values x
in addition to a plaintext, secret keys are associated with descriptive
values y, and a secret key decrypts the ciphertext if and only if
P(x, y) = 1 for some boolean predicate P. Here, y together with P
may express an arbitrarily complex access policy, which is in stark
contrast to traditional public-key encryption, where access is all or
nothing. (cid:145)e simplest example of ABE is identity-based encryption
(IBE) [29, 39, 59] where x and y are identities and P corresponds to
equality. (cid:145)e security requirement for ABE enforces resilience to
collusion a(cid:139)acks, namely any group of users holding secret keys for
di(cid:130)erent values learns nothing about the plaintext if none of them
is individually authorized to decrypt the ciphertext. (cid:145)is should
hold even if the adversary adaptively decides which secret keys to
ask for, as is inevitable in real-world scenarios.

variables corresponding to the inputs s, b, a, r of cx , ky; the degree
2 function allows us to compute ❕sa

We propose ABE schemes based on encodings cx , ky de(cid:128)ned
in terms of rational fractions of polynomials, which allows us to
capture larger classes of schemes. An example is the “petit IBE”
[64], where cx(S, B) = (B + x)S, ky(A, B, R) = A
and P corre-
sponds to the equality predicate. To prove adaptive security of
these ABE in GGM, we require that the ABE satisfy a strengthening
of the symbolic security from Agrawal-Chase [6] to the many-
key se(cid:139)ing, namely that there exists no degree two function of
cx(S, B), {ky(A, B, R) : P(x, y) = 0} that outputs SA. Looking ahead,
note that many-key symbolic security is a purely algebraic criterion,
and therefore particularly amenable to analysis using automated
tools.
Next, we prove that if we restrict cx , ky to polynomials that
satisfy some structural requirements as in prior works [6, 13] and
that the ABE satis(cid:128)es the (one-key) symbolic security from [6], then
the ABE is adaptively secure in GGM. (cid:145)is means that it su(cid:129)ces
for the automated tool to check the one-key symbolic security
criterion instead of the many-key variant. We note that a similar
result was shown in Agrawal-Chase [6], where they (cid:128)rst apply a
transformation to the ABE scheme which blows up the ciphertext
and key sizes by a factor of 2, and showed that the ensuing ABE
is adaptively secure in the standard model; in contrast, we prove
adaptive security of the ABE “as is” in GGM. Compared to the la(cid:139)er
schemes, our schemes are simpler and twice as e(cid:129)cient in terms of
encryption time, decryption time, ciphertext and key sizes, but we
only achieve security in the idealized GGM model. We note that
all known non-trivial a(cid:139)acks on bilinear groups in use today are
captured by GGM. For this reason, we believe that our ABE schemes
provide a compelling alternative to less e(cid:129)cient standard model
schemes in practical applications where performance is paramount.
Formally, we obtain both results in a uni(cid:128)ed manner by showing
that for ABE captured by restricted polynomials cx , ky as in the
la(cid:139)er, symbolic security implies many-key symbolic security. We
note that a few of the ABE schemes captured by our framework
have been informally claimed to be adaptively secure in GGM (e.g.
[43, footnote 1 (Chapter 6)]), but to the best of our knowledge, our
work provides the (cid:128)rst formal treatment of adaptive security in
GGM for a broad class of schemes satisfying a simple algebraic
criterion.
En route, we prove a “Master (cid:145)eorem” relating security in the
GGM to security in a symbolic model. (cid:145)e main technical di(cid:130)er-
ence with prior work is that our Master (cid:145)eorem handle rational
fractions instead of polynomials [16, 17, 28].

Automated proofs. Our main theorem establishes that every RFI
ABE which satis(cid:128)es symbolic security is also secure in the GGM, and
justi(cid:128)es using automated methods for proving symbolic security. In-
formally, our notion of symbolic security asserts the (non-)existence
of a solution to a system of equations between rational fractions;
one speci(cid:128)city is that these equations may include so-called big
i =1 ei, where
n can take arbitrary values. Because neither symbolic computa-
tion nor algorithmic veri(cid:128)cation tools can deal with big operators
(the former do not support big operators and the la(cid:139)er operate
on a bounded state space), we develop constraint-solving methods
that can successfully analyze the systems of equations represent-
ing cryptographic constructions. Broadly speaking, the algorithms
combine simpli(cid:128)cation rules, which turn systems into simpler ones
and case distinctions, which transform one single system into a
system of equations, adding to each new system new equations
that can trigger further simpli(cid:128)cations. In contrast to prior works,
the main novelty of our tool is to consider systems of equations
between rational fractions, rather than polynomial expressions. We
stress that our tool achieves soundness but does not constitute a
decision procedure; this means that our tool never makes mistakes
but can sometimes fail to produce an output.
Related work. Our work builds upon several areas, including
ABE, GGM, and computer-aided cryptography.
ABE. Designing adaptively secure and e(cid:129)cient a(cid:139)ribute-based
encryption schemes is hard, and has been the focus of many prior
works [47, 48, 54, 55, 61]. In 2014, Wee [63] and A(cid:139)rapadung [12]
propose simpler primitives called encoding and cryptographic com-
pilers that turn secure encodings into adaptively secure a(cid:139)ribute-
based encryption schemes for a broad range of predicates. (cid:145)eir
work is initially carried in the composite-order se(cid:139)ing; in, Chen,
Gay and Wee [36], Agrawal Chase [5], and A(cid:139)rapadung [13] adapt
the compiler to the prime order se(cid:139)ing, using the notion of Dual
System Groups (DSG) [37, 38]. More recently, Agrawal and Chase

[6] propose a notion of symbolic security for pair encodings, and
show that every symbolically secure pair encoding is compiled to
an a(cid:139)ribute-based encryption scheme that achieves full security
under a q-type assumption. Ambrona, Barthe, and Schmidt [11]
provide an algebraic characterization of the information-theoretic
notion of α-privacy for predicate encodings. Both works leave
open the possibility of building fully automated tools for checking
symbolic security or the algebraic characterization of privacy.
GGM. (cid:145)e Generic Group Model was introduced in [53, 60] to
reason about lower bounds for computing discrete logarithms and
related problems. Maurer [51] gives an alternative presentation;
while the two presentations are essentially equivalent, Maurer’s
presentation is more convenient for formalizing the Master (cid:145)eo-
rem and as a basis for formal veri(cid:128)cation. (cid:145)e GGM has been used
for analyzing a broad variety of assumptions and constructions.
Master (cid:145)eorems for bilinear groups were introduced by Boneh,
Boyen and Goh in [28, 32]. (cid:145)ere exist many others instances
of Master (cid:145)eorems; in particular, previous works on automated
analyses in the GGM (detailed below) come with their own Master
(cid:145)eorem.
Computer-aided proofs. Barthe, Cederquist and Tarento [19] use
the Coq proof assistant for building machine-checked proofs of se-
curity in the Generic Group Model. (cid:145)eir formalization is restricted
to very simple examples.
Barthe and co-workers [20] develop an automated tool for ana-
lyzing security assumptions in the GGM. (cid:145)eir tool is justi(cid:128)ed by
a Master (cid:145)eorem which reduces security in the Generic Group
Model to a weaker notion of symbolic security. However, their
Master (cid:145)eorem and their tool is primarily targe(cid:139)ed to analyze
assumptions, rather than schemes. A follow-up [21] considers the
case of structure-preserving signatures [1–4, 22, 35] and harnesses
the automated analyzer with a synthesis algorithm, which is used
to discover new schemes. However, the tool is limited to prove
security against a restricted class of adversaries. Ambrona and
co-workers [10] extend prior Master (cid:145)eorems to a more general
