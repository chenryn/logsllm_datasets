quests per exchange. The average rate of requests and the median
view length varies across the exchanges, resulting in a difference in
the scale of datasets.
We processed the raw URLs dataset to expand any URLs in the
following set of popular URL shortening services: {bit.ly, goo.gl,
ow.ly, t.co}.1 We further processed the URLs to extract the “reg-
istered domains”, according to the public sufﬁx list maintained by
Mozilla [18]. The numbers listed in Table 2 are for the processed
dataset. It contains 2.7–337K unique URLs, and 1.4–61K unique
1We compiled this list based on their high frequency in our dataset,
and unshortened the URLs belonging to them because the short-
ened versions hide the intended destination. We also observed
URLs shortened using paid shortening services in our dataset, but
did not unshorten them since they present an interesting monetiza-
tion avenue, as we sketch later in § 5.3.1.

domains per exchange. For the rest of the analysis, we work at the
granularity of registered domains.
Ethical Considerations: We were cautious to not participate
in view/click fraud when collecting our datasets. For the manual
exchanges, we collected small-scale datasets by hand. We observed
no indication of ad fraud.
In addition, since during the process
we ourselves viewed the websites circulating in the exchanges—
as expected by the exchange and a website owner/advertiser—we
view our actions as not contributing to view fraud.
For autosurf exchanges, we only collected the associated URLs,
and did not view them in an automated fashion. Our milker bots
emulated the timing patterns of requests from the autosurf tools—
except for Jingling, for which we could request URLs at a rate ﬁve
times greater than what a Jingling bot would do. (For other ex-
changes, requesting at a higher rate did not return any new URLs).
We did so after determining, as best as we could from inspect-
ing Jingling’s website, that doing so did not violate any terms-of-
service.
We note that none of our actions underlied intent to fraudulently
earn credits, as prohibited by some of the exchanges in their terms-
of-service, though such crediting did occasionally occur as a by-
product of milking. The exchanges varied in their detection of
milking: HitLeap imposed a penalty on our account after about an
hour of milking. They continued to provide us with URLs to view,
but we did not earn any credits for those URLs (as in fact, we were
not viewing them). eBesucher temporarily blocked our accounts.
Milking Jingling did not require accounts, hence we did not earn
any credits. Others showed no indications of detection.
5.2 Analysis: Manual Exchanges
For manual exchanges, our datasets are small enough that cate-
gorizing them manually was viable. Table 3 summarizes the results.
The ﬁrst category, web trafﬁc, comprises trafﬁc-related websites.
This included other manual exchanges as well as sellers of web
trafﬁc and offers of cash for manual clicks (paid-to-promote sites).
The second category, afﬁliates and marketing, comprises web-
sites that target persons attempting to earn money by selling over
the Internet. Many ads offered commissions to afﬁliates for sale of
various products and services. Some websites offered tools and in-
frastructure for afﬁliates such as email advertising. Others offered
classes and manuals on how to become a successful Internet mar-
keter. For example, one site offered a system for earning $10,000
per month as a Clickbank afﬁliate for a fee of $37 per month [6].
The large majority of the websites in these two categories ap-
peared to be directly targeted at users of manual trafﬁc exchanges,
offering the prospect of cash in exchange for small fees or various
types of simple online tasks. Websites of this type made up about
three quarters of the total on both exchanges.
The third category, other products and services, contains ads for
products and services outside the afﬁliate marketing and web trafﬁc
ecosystem itself. These ranged from web hosting services to legit-
imate niche products, such as self-published children’s ebooks or
special chocolate bars, to miracle weight loss programs and supple-
ments, to formulas for large proﬁts in currency and options trading,

Table 4: Popular domains of the milked URLs in the autosurf trafﬁc
exchanges. Bold domains represent direct monetization avenues:
the service offers pay-per-view for user content/sharing links. Italic
domains are trafﬁc exchanges; members promote exchanges in or-
der to earn activity points, as top 25 active members get a share in
the monthly cash pot (worth ≈ $10). Domains colored light-green
are backed by a blogging service triond that pays users for views
to their blog posts. Domains colored red do not have any real con-
tent and participate in ad placement fraud via referer spooﬁng on
the AppNexus ad exchange.
to a manual on how to fuel cars with water. This category makes
up about one quarter of the URLs on each exchange.
The target web sites were mostly free of external ads. We did not
observe any indication of ad fraud.
5.3 Analysis: Autosurf Exchanges
For autosurf exchanges, we focus our analysis on the popular
domains by views and URLs, since our datasets for this category
are extensive. A domain can receive a high number of views from
the exchange under three scenarios: (i) popular Internet service do-
mains having a large user base (for example, YouTube), (ii) do-
mains belonging to exchange participants, who are able to earn a
large number of exchange credits using a number of machines, and
in return direct huge volume of trafﬁc to their own domains, or (iii)
someone buying bulk views to a domain from the exchange. We
can identify the ﬁrst of these, but it is hard to differentiate between
the latter two, and we treat these as equally interesting as potential
targets for monetization/SEO/Alexa rank increase.
We characterize the top ﬁve domains by views and URL counts
for each exchange in Table 4. We observe four categories of popu-
lar domains: (i) direct monetization avenues, (ii) ad fraud domains,
(iii) legitimate looking domains, and (iv) trafﬁc exchanges.
5.3.1 Direct Monetization Avenues
This category comprises domains that pay users for views to con-
tent they upload, such as YouTube. YouTube inserts video adver-
tisements when playing user videos, and pays the user in proportion
to the legitimate views their videos receive. In recent years, another
category of services has emerged that does not require users to pro-
vide their own content in order to earn. Rather, users can get paid
for linking and sharing existing content on the Internet. For exam-
ple, URL shortening services such as adf.ly pay users for visits
to their shortened URLs. A visitor to a URL shortened using such
a service is ﬁrst shown an advertisement, and then redirected to the
URL that was shortened. Hence, money enters the eco-system from
advertisers and ﬂows to the users of the URL shortening services.
We next discuss examples of both these monetization avenues as
observed in the exchanges we studied.
The URL shortening services adf.ly, adfoc.us, and
sh.st are among the top ﬁve domains in HitLeap, Jingling and
247AutoHits. Manually inspecting several requested adf.ly
URLs reveals that 90% of the time the intermediate link solicits
downloading a video player. It is possible that in addition to le-
gitimate advertising, some of the malicious advertisers attempt to
install malware on user machines. Our observation of malicious
advertisements is consistent with the ﬁndings of Nikiforakis et al.,
who investigated malicious aspects of paid URL shortening ser-
vices [32].
Another domain in this category popular on HitLeap, Jingling,
and 10Khits is ziddu.com, a content distribution platform that
pays for ﬁle downloads and sharing news links hosted on its plat-
form [22]. Users with their own content can upload their ﬁles and
earn for downloads of those ﬁles. An alternative (and lower ef-
fort) way to earn is to share existing content on Ziddu and direct
views to it. Manually analyzing some of the ziddu.com URLs
in our dataset, we observed that they contain news content lifted
from other news websites under the title “Sponsored news”, and
generate impression requests to multiple ad networks. Further in-
specting Ziddu’s website, we found that it also offers desktop and
mobile apps to “turn idle cycles into money”. The app displays
advertisements (rather than websites) automatically, indicating that
Ziddu apparently defrauds advertisers. In a manual investigation,
we found the majority of the advertisements to be malicious, re-
questing to upgrade a media player or download a software. Ziddu
does not list pay rates on its website.
We observe another model for the domains trifter.com and
gameolosophy.com, popular in Jingling. These are niche sites
dedicated to travel and online games respectively. The content
hosted on these websites is not generated by the website owners.
Instead, these websites are backed by triond.com, a blogging
service, which automatically shares the content submitted by its
bloggers to the most relevant site out of the pool of sites it sup-
ports. Triond then pays the blogger for views to their content.
YouTube receives the highest percentage of view requests (8%)
in HitLeap, and has the second-highest percentage of URLs in this
exchange. Note that YouTube video watch URLs2 play videos au-
tomatically upon opening the link in a browser or an autosurf tool.
Hence, directing exchange trafﬁc to YouTube videos results in the
videos being auto-watched. We investigated whether sending ex-
change trafﬁc from HitLeap to YouTube videos results in increas-
ing video view counts, and consequently provides a monetization
avenue. We extracted the list of YouTube videos from our dataset
(≈ 10K unique videos) and queried the YouTube API to get their
view counts. Per Figure 1, approximately 24% of the videos in
circulation on the HitLeap exchange were no longer available on
YouTube at the time of querying; they were either taken down by
YouTube or the user themselves. 25% had a view count frozen at

Table 5: Percentage of milked URLs and corresponding impres-
sions served by sites exhibiting referrer-spooﬁng ad placement
fraud in various exchanges.
Media exchange in their study of fraudulent activities in online ad
exchanges. The convoluted online advertising ecosystem fosters
this kind of fraud. In particular, the exchange/advertisers take the
referrer in the URL parameters at face value. Although the impres-
sion requests to an ad exchange contain an id value that determines
which party gets credited when an ad is displayed on the site in the
referrer ﬁeld, the need for reaching broad audiences in online ad-
vertising complicates its use for fraud detection. Since impressions
can be bought through an intermediary (rather than directly from
publishers) to enable wider reach, an ad exchange cannot employ
an exclusive website-owner-speciﬁc id to be credited on impres-
sion requests for the particular website [25].
Given that we observed referrer spooﬁng fraud as one of the ma-
jor categories in multiple exchanges, we ﬁngerprinted this behavior
in order to classify the number of URLs in our dataset that partici-
pate in this fraud. We crawled the entire datasets using a distributed
infrastructure, recording all the web requests that each URL gen-
erates.4 We then identiﬁed the URLs that generate requests to
adnxs.com with spoofed referrers. We identiﬁed spoofed refer-
rers as those that are for a domain other than on which the ad is ac-
tually displayed. Table 5 summarizes our ﬁndings. We ﬁnd ≈ 2.5K
URLs in HitLeap and Jingling that participate in this ad fraud, re-
spectively accounting for 23% and 11% of the total impression re-
quests we milked for these exchanges. Other exchanges have fewer
URLs, accounting for 1–9% of their impression requests.

5.3.3 Legitimate looking domains
We ﬁnd some of the other websites harder to judge. While essen-
tially all of them bear advertisements, some of these appear to be
niche websites targeted at topics such as cars, sneakers, workout,
and news speciﬁc to a particular location.

eBesucher,
mustbuysneakers.com, is a legitimate-looking niche website,
with an ‘Advertising: Starboyant Media’ tag in the website footer.
Investigating the Starboyant Media website, we found that it offers
advertising on three other niche websites: onlyhiphop.com,
workouteveryday.com, and stylishceleb.com. We
ﬁnd all of these in our eBesucher dataset, accounting for 22% of
the total impression requests we milked on eBesucher.

We ﬁnd ourselves unable to judge whether these and other
legitimate-looking domains are websites with considerable legiti-
mate trafﬁc to which a fraudster also directs trafﬁc, or they have
been crafted to make judgment difﬁcult and have little trafﬁc be-
yond that automatically generated.
5.3.4 Trafﬁc Exchanges
Surprisingly, most of the top domains in the basic autosurf ex-
change 247AutoHits are other trafﬁc exchanges. On closer inspec-
4We opened each website in a browser instance until the browser
indicated that the page had ﬁnished loading.
Figure 1: Distribution of view counts of the YouTube video URLs
obtained by milking trafﬁc exchanges. We obtained the view counts
of the videos by querying the YouTube API provided by Google.
The size of the discontinuity at 301 views indicates the fraction of
videos stuck at that view count. Note that about 25% of HitLeap
but only 10% of EnhanceViews Autowatcher videos are stuck there.
The discontinuity at 301 views suggests that YouTube’s fraud de-
tection prevents many videos from advancing beyond this point,
even if they receive many more clicks.
301 (indicating that YouTube had identiﬁed something suspicious
with the views [13]). However, ≈ 42% of the videos on HitLeap
had view counts above 301, with a maximum of 18 million views.
Recall from Table 1 that HitLeap views are short-lived (60s at
maximum), which possibly could be a factor in the detection of
its fraudulent trafﬁc. For comparison, we look at the view counts
of YouTube videos in the EnhanceViews Autowatcher exchange,
which plays the full video for each view. We observe in Figure 1
that EnhanceViews Autowatcher does better than HitLeap, with a
frozen view count for only 10% of the videos.
We also queried the YouTube API to get the channel ID and the
categories of the videos in our HitLeap dataset. The 10K videos
were associated with ≈ 2,500 channels—8% of the videos came
from a single channel. The videos in this dominant channel be-
longed to the categories Gaming, Shows, and Film/Animation, with
none of the videos stuck at a view count of 301. Inspecting this
channel, we found that the latest video gathered 25K views in one
day, though we lack visibility into what fraction of these were
fraudulently generated. Generally, we ﬁnd that 26% of the videos
in our dataset belong to the Gaming category and 23% in the cat-
egory People and Blogs, with the former mainly screen-captures
of people playing video games, and the latter primarily comprising
tutorials.
5.3.2 Ad Placement Fraud
We also observed websites that show clear evidence of impres-
sion/click fraud. For example, ads-host-media.com, ijgbiorjg.com,
and 4554fdd56f4.com in HitLeap do not display any content
to a visiting user.3 But these sites generate dozens of ad re-
quests with varying referrers to the AppNexus ad exchange [4].
The URL requests are of the format: ib.adnxs.com/tt?ttjb=
1&bdc=1&bdh=CQLrezBk2vGyQNA7G5993lyZhww.&id=3445029&size=
300x250&referrer=carpreserve.com, with varying referrers sent
on each request.
Others have documented this referrer spooﬁng fraud [35, 25].
