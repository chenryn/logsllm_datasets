### Data Processing and Analysis

#### Overview
The rate of requests and the median view length vary across different exchanges, leading to differences in dataset scales. We processed the raw URLs dataset to expand any URLs from popular URL shortening services such as bit.ly, goo.gl, ow.ly, and t.co. Additionally, we extracted the "registered domains" based on the public suffix list maintained by Mozilla [18]. The numbers listed in Table 2 are for the processed dataset, which contains 2.7–337K unique URLs and 1.4–61K unique domains per exchange.

#### URL Shortening and Domain Extraction
We compiled a list of high-frequency URL shortening services in our dataset and unshortened the URLs from these services because the shortened versions often obscure the intended destination. We also observed URLs shortened using paid services but did not unshorten them, as they present an interesting monetization avenue, which we discuss later in §5.3.1.

#### Category Distribution
Table 3 shows the distribution of website and ad categories observed on EasyHits4U and HitSafari. The categories include web traffic, affiliates and marketing, and other products and services.

| Category | EasyHits4U | HitSafari |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Web Traffic | 30% | 38% |
| Affiliates and Marketing | 48% | 35% |
| Other Products and Services | 22% | 27% |

#### Ethical Considerations
We were cautious to avoid participating in view/click fraud during data collection. For manual exchanges, we collected small-scale datasets manually and observed no indication of ad fraud. Since we viewed the websites as expected by the exchanges, we do not consider our actions to contribute to view fraud.

For autosurf exchanges, we only collected associated URLs without automated viewing. Our milker bots emulated the timing patterns of requests from the autosurf tools, except for Jingling, where we could request URLs at a higher rate. We ensured that our actions did not violate any terms-of-service. None of our actions were intended to fraudulently earn credits, though some crediting occurred as a by-product of milking. Detection of milking varied: HitLeap imposed penalties, eBesucher temporarily blocked accounts, and Jingling did not require accounts, so no credits were earned.

### Analysis: Manual Exchanges

For manual exchanges, we categorized the datasets manually. Table 3 summarizes the results:

- **Web Traffic**: Includes traffic-related websites, such as other manual exchanges, sellers of web traffic, and offers of cash for manual clicks.
- **Affiliates and Marketing**: Websites targeting individuals earning money through online sales. Many offered commissions for affiliate sales and provided tools and training for internet marketers.
- **Other Products and Services**: Ads for various products and services outside the affiliate marketing and web traffic ecosystem, ranging from legitimate niche products to fraudulent schemes.

These categories made up approximately 75% and 25% of the total URLs on both exchanges, respectively.

### Analysis: Autosurf Exchanges

For autosurf exchanges, we focused on popular domains by views and URLs. A domain can receive high views if it is a popular internet service, belongs to exchange participants, or someone buys bulk views. We characterized the top five domains by views and URL counts for each exchange in Table 4, identifying four categories: direct monetization avenues, ad fraud domains, legitimate-looking domains, and traffic exchanges.

#### Direct Monetization Avenues
This category includes domains that pay users for content views, such as YouTube, and services that pay for linking and sharing existing content, like URL shortening services (adf.ly, adfoc.us, sh.st). These services insert ads before redirecting to the original URL, generating revenue from advertisers.

#### Ad Fraud Domains
We observed websites showing clear evidence of impression/click fraud. For example, ads-host-media.com, ijgbiorjg.com, and 4554fdd56f4.com in HitLeap generate numerous ad requests with spoofed referrers to the AppNexus ad exchange.

#### Legitimate-Looking Domains
Some websites, while bearing advertisements, appear to be niche sites targeted at specific topics. It is challenging to determine whether these sites have legitimate traffic or are crafted to make judgment difficult.

#### Traffic Exchanges
Surprisingly, many top domains in basic autosurf exchanges like 247AutoHits are other traffic exchanges. These splash pages are provided by the exchange itself for circulation in other exchanges.

### Referrer Spoofing Ad Placement Fraud

We observed referrer spoofing as a major category of fraud in multiple exchanges. We fingerprinted this behavior to classify URLs participating in this fraud. Table 5 summarizes our findings, showing that ≈ 2.5K URLs in HitLeap and Jingling participate in this ad fraud, accounting for 23% and 11% of the total impression requests, respectively.

### YouTube View Counts

We investigated whether sending exchange traffic to YouTube videos increases view counts. We found that approximately 24% of the videos in circulation on HitLeap were no longer available, and 25% had a view count frozen at 301, indicating YouTube's fraud detection. However, 42% of the videos had view counts above 301, with a maximum of 18 million views.

### Conclusion

Our analysis highlights the diverse nature of websites and the varying levels of fraud and monetization strategies across different exchanges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for maintaining the integrity of online advertising and web traffic ecosystems.
