_TS_
    enum Color {Red = 6, Green=5, Blue};
    let colorName: string = Color[2];
    alert(colorName);
**  
_JS_
    var Color;
    (function (Color) {
        Color[Color["Red"] = 6] = "Red";
        Color[Color["Green"] = 5] = "Green";
        Color[Color["Blue"] = 6] = "Blue";
    })(Color || (Color = {}));
    ;
    var colorName = Color[2];
    alert(colorName);
**
**Expected behavior:**  
Since 'Red' is number 6, and 'Blue' defined automatically to follow 'Green's
5, 'Blue' should be getting any number that not listed yet,  
The alert should not call 'Blue'.
**Actual behavior:**  
The 'Blue' element in the enum get 6 because it follows 'Green' 5 and did not
get a pre-set.
