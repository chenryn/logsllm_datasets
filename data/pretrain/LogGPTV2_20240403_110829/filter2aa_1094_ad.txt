### Advocates for Unlicensed Use of White Spaces

While some advocates argue that the market should determine the use of white spaces, numerous instances demonstrate that uncertainty, high costs, and limited return on investment have often deterred for-profit deployments in similarly restricted spectrum. In contrast, the success of the 2.4 GHz band illustrates that seemingly restrictive and unattractive spectrum can be used to benefit the public in various ways. For example, entities may deploy broadband services as a public good using unlicensed spectrum and technologies such as self-organizing mesh networks. Therefore, any valuation of white spaces must consider the significant benefits derived from allowing the public direct access to this spectrum. The Commission should continue with its initial plan to allocate the white spaces for unlicensed use. This decision, combined with the upcoming DTV auctions, will ensure that TV band spectrum is available for both licensed and unlicensed applications.

### No Need for a New Enforcement Regime for Unlicensed Devices

Broadcasters have called for a new enforcement regime to police unlicensed devices operating in the TV bands. However, as previously discussed by the Coalition, the primary justification for such a regime—that devices could operate inconsistently with the Commission’s rules—applies equally to licensed devices. Indeed, two primary examples of harmful interference cited by MSTV (Nextel operations in the 800 MHz band and satellite radios) involved licensed rather than unlicensed operations.

MSTV notes that websites sell devices that could modify Wi-Fi devices to make them non-conforming, but users also illegally operate in licensed spectrum bands. There are countless abuses of licensed spectrum, including the sale of illegal cell phone jammers, individuals modifying cell phones to transmit at illegally high power levels, and unauthorized wireless microphones in the TV bands.

The Commission already has substantial tools at its disposal, including equipment authorization, fines, and import prohibitions, to address the unlikely scenario of widespread non-conforming use by unlicensed TV band devices. Thus, there is no reason to seriously consider MSTV’s suggestion that unlicensed devices respond to “kill signals” sent via the Internet. Such a requirement would invite hackers and unnecessarily restrict device use by requiring an internet connection. Additionally, evaluating this proposal would introduce further delays. Calls for a new enforcement regime must be based on more than speculation about the Commission's inability or unwillingness to enforce its rules.

### Other Issues

#### Wireless Microphones

The Coalition is confident that the Commission's testing will confirm that the proposed detection threshold of -114 dBm will provide wireless microphone licensees with the necessary interference protection. However, wireless microphone advocates have requested that the Commission set aside vacant TV channels for their exclusive use. While the Coalition believes this is unnecessary, it does not oppose reserving channels between 2-20 for wireless microphones.

Wireless microphone advocates have also proposed a beacon system to create a "bubble" around areas where wireless microphones are transmitting. This "bubble" would not provide additional benefits for wireless microphone users, who are already fully protected by the Coalition’s proposed threshold. Instead, it would prevent the public from maximizing the benefits of unlicensed devices by preempting the use of white spaces over wide geographic areas and long periods.

Moreover, many wireless microphone users in the TV band operate illegally. Allowing these users to use beacons to block out spectrum would prioritize illegal use over authorized use. The Commission should not protect unlawful users, as doing so would ratify illegality and encourage others to flout the rules. It would be more sensible to end the licensed status of wireless microphones and make them unlicensed devices.

#### Public Safety Operation on Channels 14-20

The Coalition shares the Commission’s concern about protecting public safety operations on channels 14-20 and did not advocate for personal/portable devices on these channels in its opening comments. However, the Coalition is pleased that Motorola supports the use of personal/portable devices for public safety and first responders on these channels. Allowing public safety agencies to supplement their operations with unlicensed personal/portable devices will provide backup protection and allow them to benefit from unlicensed devices.

Consumer personal/portable devices can be easily modified to accommodate public safety operations on channels 14-20. By allocating channels 21-51 for unlicensed personal/portable use by the public, the Commission can ensure that prices for public safety devices decrease, providing both the general public and public safety users with affordable access to the benefits of these devices.

#### Interference to Cable Systems

Although the Coalition’s analysis suggests otherwise, the cable industry maintains that unlicensed TV band devices represent a significant potential source of interference to cable operations. While the Coalition disagrees with most of NCTA’s assertions, it does not oppose NCTA’s recommendation that personal/portable devices not operate on channels 2-4. The Coalition does not oppose restricting personal/portable devices from all VHF channels, which appear to be the source of many of NCTA’s concerns regarding direct pickup interference.

However, the Commission should reject other measures proposed by the NCTA, including capping transmit power for personal/portable devices at 10-20 mW and requiring coordination with cable headends operating outside the Grade B Contour. Cable headend antennas are typically mounted far off the ground and are highly directional, making off-axis interference from low-power personal/portable devices unlikely. Moreover, cable companies have accepted the risk of relying on unprotected transmissions by setting up headends beyond the Grade B Contour.

#### Wireless Medical Telemetry Services

Two parties have expressed concern about harmful interference to devices in the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS). While 8 MHz of this spectrum is allocated at 1.4 GHz, the Commission has also allocated 6 MHz to this service at 608-614 MHz, corresponding to TV channel 37. The Commission has proposed that TV band devices not operate on this channel, and the Coalition agrees that this is a sensible restriction.

However, the Coalition does not believe that the myriad other restrictions proposed by GE Healthcare and the American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) are necessary. Assuming the Commission restricts devices from operating on channel 37, it will eliminate the risk of co-channel interference. Given the close proximity between the transmit and receive antennas of WMTS devices, there is little chance that a 100 mW personal/portable device operating on channels 36 or 38 would cause interference. The Coalition’s proposed device always uses TPC to transmit at the minimum required power, further reducing the likelihood of adjacent channel interference.

ASHE and GE Healthcare have raised concerns about legacy Part 15 medical telemetry devices, which were authorized to operate in most of the TV spectrum without protection from harmful interference. The Commission created a safe harbor for medical telemetry several years ago, allocating 14 MHz (including 8 MHz outside the TV band) where operators could relocate and receive protection. Despite this, some healthcare providers continue to deploy unprotected Part 15 devices because WMTS devices are not compatible with their old hardware.

While GE Healthcare suggests delaying the introduction of TV band devices on channels 33-36 until 2010, granting this request would only encourage irresponsible behavior. By February 2009, medical telemetry operators will have had almost a decade of notice about the WMTS safe harbor. If interference protection for medical telemetry is a “matter of life and death,” healthcare providers should stop operating in unprotected spectrum within the next two years. The Commission cannot allow its policy goals to be thwarted by those who have not yet relocated to the protected WMTS bands despite ample notice.

### Conclusion

The Commission’s decision to make the TV white spaces available for new devices creates exciting possibilities for Americans, including affordable broadband access and innovative devices and services. However, this potential will be realized only if the technical requirements do not sacrifice flexibility to accommodate overreaching interference protection proposals. The Coalition urges the Commission to adopt minimal technical and operational rules, thereby encouraging innovation. The Commission should confirm that the technical and operational parameters proposed by the Coalition will provide incumbent users with the protection they are entitled to by testing the Coalition’s prototype device. The Commission should also authorize personal/portable devices concurrently with fixed devices and reaffirm its initial decision that an unlicensed model is most appropriate for the TV white spaces. By taking these steps, the Commission will help ensure that the American people achieve the maximum benefit from this valuable public resource.
