advocates may maintain that the market should decide whether the white spaces should 
be used, there are numerous instances where uncertainty, high costs, and bleak prospects 
for return on investment have limited the attractiveness of for-profit deployments in 
spectrum with similar restrictions.71  In contrast, as the success of the 2.4 GHz band 
demonstrates, seemingly restrictive and unattractive spectrum can be used to benefit the 
public in a number of ways.  Entities may seek to deploy broadband services as a public 
good using unlicensed spectrum and technologies such as self organizing mesh networks.  
Thus, any valuation of white spaces must take into account the numerous benefits to be 
derived from allowing the public direct access to this spectrum.  In short, the Commission

should continue with its initial plan to allocate the white spaces for unlicensed use.  This 
decision, coupled with the upcoming DTV auctions, will ensure that TV band spectrum is 
available for both licensed and unlicensed applications.                     
C. 
The Commission Should Not Introduce a New Enforcement Regime 
for Unlicensed Devices.  
Broadcasters also have called for a new enforcement regime to police unlicensed 
devices operating in the TV bands.72  However, as the Coalition previously has discussed, 
their primary justification for doing so—that devices could operate in a manner 
inconsistent with the Commission’s rules—applies with equal force to licensed devices.73  
Indeed, two of the primary examples MSTV cites to demonstrate the risks of harmful 
interference (Nextel operations in the 800 MHz band and satellite radios) involved 
licensed rather than unlicensed operations.74        
MSTV notes that websites sell devices that could be used to modify Wi-Fi 
devices to make them non-conforming,75 but users also operate illegally in licensed 
spectrum bands.  Indeed, as the Commission is aware, there are of countless abuses of 
licensed spectrum, including websites and vendors in large cities selling illegal cell phone 
jammers, individuals modifying cell phones to transmit at illegally excessive power, 
users illegally operating wireless microphones in the TV bands, ham radio operators 
transmitting on unauthorized frequencies and at illegal power levels, and marine radio 
licensees operating illegally.

The Commission already has substantial tools at its disposal—including 
equipment authorization, fines, and prohibition of imports—to deal with the unlikely 
scenario of widespread non-conforming use by unlicensed TV band devices.76  Thus, 
there is certainly no reason to give serious consideration to MSTV’s two-sentence 
insistence that the Commission require unlicensed devices to respond to “kill signals” 
sent via the Internet.77  Such a requirement would be an open invitation to hackers, who 
could use such signals to cause massive malicious denial of service attacks, and 
unnecessarily restrict the use of devices by requiring them to maintain a connection to an 
ISP to operate.  Further, as MSTV concedes (and perhaps intends) evaluating this 
proposal also would introduce additional delay in this proceeding.78  Calls for a new 
enforcement regime must be based on more than MSTV’s speculation that the 
Commission will be unwilling or unable to enforce its rules.                                  
IV. 
OTHER ISSUES.   
A. 
Wireless Microphones. 
As the Coalition explained in its opening comments, it is confident that 
Commission testing will confirm that the Coalition’s proposed detection threshold of -
114 dBm will provide wireless microphone licensees with the interference protection to 
which they are entitled.79  However, wireless microphone advocates have now submitted 
a new request, asking the Commission to set aside a number of vacant TV channels for

29
their exclusive use.80  While the Coalition believes that such a proposal is not necessary 
to protect wireless microphone use, it is not opposed to reserving channels for wireless 
microphone use, provided that those channels are between channels 2-20.   
Wireless microphone advocates have also proposed a beacon system to create a 
“bubble” around areas where wireless microphones are transmitting.81  Such a “bubble” 
will not provide any additional benefits for wireless microphone users, whom the 
Coalition’s proposed detection threshold will protect fully (and who may also have 
excess protection through the reservation of channels 2-20).  Instead, these beacons 
would prevent the public from receiving the maximum benefits from unlicensed devices 
by unnecessarily preempting use of the white spaces over wide geographic areas and long 
periods of time.     
In addition, the record in this proceeding demonstrates that many—if not most—
wireless microphone users in the TV band operate illegally.82  Just as sales of wireless 
microphones have not been restricted only to licensed users, sales of beacons would 
surely spread to these same scofflaws, who would then create “bubbles” around their 
unauthorized wireless microphone transmissions.  Even implicitly allowing illegal 
devices to use beacons to block out spectrum around their transmissions would prioritize 
illegal use over authorized use of the white spaces.  The Commission need not—and 
should not—protect unlawful users, as doing so would be de facto ratification of the

illegality and invite others to flout the Commission’s rules.  It would make more sense 
simply to end the licensed status of wireless microphones and make them unlicensed 
devices. 
B. 
Public Safety Operation on Channels 14-20.   
The Coalition shares the Commission’s concern about protecting public safety 
operations on channels 14-20,83 and for this reason did not advocate that 
personal/portable devices be allowed on these channels in its opening comments.  
However, the Coalition is pleased to learn that Motorola advocates the use of 
personal/portable devices for public safety and first responders in channels 14-20.84  
Allowing public safety agencies to supplement their existing operations with unlicensed 
personal/portable devices not only will provide back up protection for existing uses, but 
will allow public safety agencies to obtain the benefits the general public will receive 
from unlicensed devices.85  The Coalition disagrees with Motorola that spectrum sensing 
is unproven, and (as stated previously) is confident that the Commission will so find. 
The Coalition notes that consumer personal/portable devices can easily be 
modified by the manufacturer to accommodate public safety operations on channels 14-
20.  Thus, by allocating the use of channels 21-51 for unlicensed personal/portable use by 
the public, the Commission can ensure that prices for counterpart public safety devices 
will decrease dramatically, providing both the general public and public safety users with 
affordable access to the benefits that these devices will provide.

C. 
Interference to Cable Systems.   
Although the Coalition’s analysis suggests otherwise, the cable industry continues 
to maintain that unlicensed TV band devices represent a significant potential source of 
interference to cable operations.86  While the Coalition disagrees with the majority of 
NCTA’s assertions, it does not specifically oppose NCTA’s recommendation that 
personal/portable devices not operate on channels 2-4.87  Indeed, the Coalition does not 
oppose restricting personal/portable devices from all VHF channels, which appears to be 
the source of many of NCTA’s concerns regarding direct pickup interference.88   
However, the Commission should reject outright the other measures proposed by 
the NCTA, including capping transmit power for personal/portable devices at 10-20 mW, 
and requiring coordination with cable headends operating outside the Grade B Contour.89  
As a threshold matter, cable headend antennas are usually mounted far off the ground and 
out of the way of populated areas, and typically are highly directional.  These factors 
make off-axis interference generated by a low power personal/portable device highly 
unlikely.  More fundamentally, by setting up headends beyond the Grade B Contour, 
cable companies have accepted the risk of relying on transmissions that are not protected 
from harmful interference.  Arguments that the Commission should not take into account 
“whether the broadcast signal received is inside or outside of a defined contour”90 do not

Comments”).

help determine how best to enable use of the white spaces, but merely seek to expand 
impermissibly the rights of broadcasters beyond the scope of their licenses.  
The NCTA implies that the restrictions it has proposed are necessary to allow 
cable companies to meet their “must carry” obligations under Part 76 of the 
Commission’s rules,91 but this is simply not so.  If a broadcaster wishes to invoke its must 
carry rights, it has the obligation to provide a “good quality” signal (which the 
Commission has determined to be -61 dBm or better for digital signals) at the cable 
system’s principal headend.92  Indeed, cable companies routinely refuse to carry 
broadcasters’ signals based on their failure to provide a good quality signal to their 
principal headends.93  As the NCTA concedes, signals are often delivered terrestrially 
rather than over-the-air,94 and there is no reason that broadcasters cannot do so if they 
cannot deliver a -61 dBm signal to areas where they are not entitled to interference 
protection.

D. 
Wireless Medical Telemetry Services. 
Finally, two parties have expressed concern about harmful interference to devices 
in the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (“WMTS”).95  While 8 MHz of this spectrum 
is allocated at 1.4 GHz, the Commission also has allocated 6 MHz to this service at 608-
614 MHz, which corresponds to TV channel 37.  The Commission has proposed that TV 
band devices not operate on this channel, and the Coalition agrees that this is a sensible 
restriction.  Accordingly, the Coalition is has no objection to programming devices to 
avoid this channel.    
However, the Coalition does not believe that the myriad other restrictions 
proposed by GE Healthcare and the American Society for Healthcare Engineering 
(“ASHE”)96 will be required to authorize the use of the low power devices that the 
Coalition has contemplated.  Assuming that the Commission restricts devices from 
operating in channel 37, it will have completely eliminated the risk of co-channel 
interference.  Moreover, given the extremely close proximity between the transmit and 
receive antennas of these devices, there is also very little chance that a 100 mW 
personal/portable operating in channels 36 or 38 would cause interference to the WMTS 
device even if the personal/portable device were being used by the patient.  Finally, the 
device proposed by the coalition always will use TPC to transmit at the minimum 
95  See generally Comments of GE Healthcare (“GE Healthcare Comments”); Comments of the American 
Society for Healthcare Engineering of the American Hospital Association (“ASHE Comments”).   
96  For example, these comments have proposed a requirement that personal/portable devices employ 
geolocation technologies, that they restrict operation on certain vacant channels, and that operators 
notify health care facilities prior to commencing operations.  See GE Healthcare Comments at 3-5, 8-
10; ASHE Comments at 5-6.    
34
required power for reliable communication, reducing the likelihood of adjacent channel 
interference even further.   
ASHE and GE Healthcare also have raised the issue of legacy Part 15 medical 
telemetry devices, which were authorized to operate in most of the TV spectrum without  
protection from harmful interference.97  Of course, the vulnerable status of these older 
devices is the very reason why the Commission created a safe harbor for medical 
telemetry several years ago, allocating 14 MHz (including 8 MHz outside the TV band 
entirely) where operators could relocate and receive protection.  Nevertheless, some 
health care providers have continued to deploy unprotected Part 15 devices because 
WMTS devices are not compatible with their old hardware.98  Indeed, GE Healthcare 
continues to sell devices that operate in unprotected spectrum notwithstanding that the 
Commission first announced its intention to authorize white space devices in 2002.99        
While GE Healthcare maintains that the Commission should delay the 
introduction of TV band devices on channels 33-36 until 2010 to allow heath care 
providers more time to migrate,100 granting this request will serve only to encourage more 
irresponsible behavior on the part of those still operating medical devices in unprotected 
bands.  By the time TV band devices are authorized for operation in February 2009,

medical telemetry operators will have had notice of WMTS safe harbor for almost an 
entire decade.  
As ASHE concedes, it is hard to determine the exact number of health care 
providers that may still be operating unprotected older devices outside the safe harbor.101  
But if interference protection for medical telemetry truly is a “matter of life and death,” 
the time for those stragglers who have still not relocated to the protected WMTS bands to 
do so is today.  These providers have had notice of the safe harbor for years, and have 
had notice of this proceeding for almost as long.  Health care providers can—and most 
certainly should—stop operating in unprotected spectrum within the next two years if 
they have not done so already.  The Commission cannot allow its policy goals to be 
thwarted by those too cheap or irresponsible to buy appropriate equipment even with 
almost ten years’ advance notice.    
CONCLUSION 
The Commission’s decision to make available the TV white spaces for use by 
new devices has created exciting possibilities for Americans, including affordable 
broadband access and a host of innovative devices and services.  However, this potential 
will be realized only if the technical requirements for such devices do not sacrifice 
flexibility to accommodate overreaching interference protection proposals.  The Coalition 
urges the Commission to adopt minimal technical and operational rules, thereby 
encouraging innovation to flourish.  In particular, the Commission should confirm that 
the technical and operational parameters proposed by the Coalition will provide 
incumbent users with the protection to which they are entitled by testing the Coalition’s 
101  ASHE Comments at 4 n.7.

prototype device.  The Commission should also authorize personal/portable devices 
concurrently with fixed devices, and reaffirm its initial decision that an unlicensed model 
is most appropriate for the TV white spaces.  By taking these steps, the Commission will 
help ensure that the American people achieve the maximum benefit from this valuable 
public resource.
