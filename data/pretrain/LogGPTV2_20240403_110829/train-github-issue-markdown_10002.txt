In issue #13133 for AngularJS, it is evident that AngularJS does not integrate well with the Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) format. However, both AMD and CommonJS are becoming the default module loading techniques for TypeScript.

Will Angular v2 address this issue and provide compatibility with AMD and CommonJS loaders, such as RequireJS?
