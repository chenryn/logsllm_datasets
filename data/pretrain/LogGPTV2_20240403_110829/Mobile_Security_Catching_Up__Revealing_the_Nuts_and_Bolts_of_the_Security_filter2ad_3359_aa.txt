Abstract—We are currently moving from the Internet society
to a mobile society where more and more access to information
is done by previously dumb phones. For example, the number
of mobile phones using a full blown OS has risen to nearly
200% from Q3/2009 to Q3/2010. As a result, mobile security
is no longer immanent, but imperative. This survey paper
provides a concise overview of mobile network security, attack
vectors using the back end system and the web browser, but
also the hardware layer and the user as attack enabler. We
show differences and similarities between “normal” security
and mobile security, and draw conclusions for further research
opportunities in this area.

I. INTRODUCTION
The beginning of the smartphone era can be seen as be-
ginning with the new millennium. Since then, numerous new
“smart” devices like BlackBerries, iPhones and, recently,
Android-based phones have been introduced that revolu-
tionized the market. At the same time, many articles about
smartphone security and the potential of malicious software
on them were published [1]–[8]. Quite often, studies had
statements similar to the following quote by Gartner which
estimated “that by the end of 2007, enough factors will have
come together that the risk of mobile attacks will be much
greater. Those factors include less heterogeneity in operating
systems, more penetration of smartphones and a greater in-
cidence of people actually accepting downloads and sending
executables to one another on mobile devices” [9]. However,
up to now the expected plethora of attacks has not been
observed.
Many researchers and practitioners are expecting a major
security incident with mobile phones ever since these devices
began to become more powerful: with increased processing
power and memory, increased data transmission capabilities
of the mobile phone networks, and with open and third-party
extensible operating systems, phones become an interesting
target for attackers. However, no major incident has hap-
pened as of the time of this writing.
The reasons for this are unclear. However, certain inherent
aspects seem to have a positive effect on security, one of
them being the heterogeneity of mobile operating systems.
Contrary to the prediction quoted above, heterogeneity of
mobile operating systems has actually increased instead of

decreased. Besides the operating systems Windows Mobile
and Symbian OS, the mobile world has seen the advent of
the iPhone’s iOS and the Linux-based Android operating
system during the last few years. Despite of their young age,
both operating systems already gained their market share and
they are predicted to even increase it in the future. Table I
provides an overview of global sales ﬁgures and market
share for mobile operating systems and the huge growth of
Android is clearly visible. Second, it might simply be the
case that mobile operating systems are sufﬁciently secure
today as voiced by Bontchev [10]. Hence, this might be
another reason why no major security incident has happened
until now. Third,
there may be additional factors such
as the different network topologies: for the Internet, it is
nearly end-to-end, while strongly hierarchical for mobile
networks. Last but not
there is also the effect of
the “self-defeating prophecy” of mobile security: Having
the strong example of desktop insecurity, plus plausible
attack scenarios, the claims of mobile insecurity might have
triggered mobile security. Overall, the reasons for the non-
existence of major security incidents for mobile phones are
still unclear up to now.
least,
However, we recently saw the ﬁrst real attacks against
smartphones: In March 2010, Iozzo and Weinmann demon-
strated a drive-by download attack against an iPhone 3GS
that enabled an attacker to steal the SMS database from
the phone [12]. In November 2010, one of the ﬁrst public
exploits to perform an attack against the mobile browser
shipped with Android was released [13]. Recently, Wein-
mann introduced the ﬁrst over-the-air exploitation of mem-
ory corruptions in GSM software stacks [14] and Oberheide
and Lanier identiﬁed several attack vectors against
the
iTunes App Store [15]. So it is not far fetched to ask whether
we are now at the beginning of an era of attacks against
smartphones?
In this paper, we survey the area of smartphone secu-
rity. This topic covers all mechanisms that are intended to
increase the security of sophisticated mobile devices. The
contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we survey
and structure the state of the art in the area of smartphone
security. We systematize the research that has been done
in this area in the last years and provide a categorization.
Second, we present directions of future research on these
subjects and outline challenges that we expect to emerge. In
summary, this paper provides a detailed overview of different
aspects of the topic smartphone security and it serves as a
guide for past, present, and future work in this area.
II. FROM MOBILE TO SECURITY
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce some terms we use
throughout the paper and then clarify why mobile security
is a topic of its own. This extends some preliminary work
by Oberheide and Jahanian, who recently performed a brief
survey of this area [8].
A. Initial Deﬁnition
As a ﬁrst approach, the investigation subject of this paper
is deﬁned as: any mobile device that contains a smartcard
that is controlled by a mobile network operator (MNO).
Intuitively, this is the deﬁnition of a mobile phone.
This deﬁnition is too broad for us because it also covers
mobile phones that are not in the focus of this paper. These
are mainly the kind of phones that can only be used for
the phone functionality (plus text messaging and some basic
other functionality), often aligned with a limited display size.
Such phones are called feature phones. They sometimes have
proprietary operating systems and are not extensible with
additional software. Even though the applications on these
phones can be attacked, e.g., Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
with malformed short messages, they are not the typical
attack target of mobile malicious software.
Other exceptions are some restricted environments that are
not in the focus of this paper either: USB sticks that enable
laptops to use the mobile network are also not covered.
Moreover,
there are some other devices with operator-
controlled smartcards that are a restricted environment of
their own (e.g., machine-to-machine types of communica-
tion). Both are not extensible with third-party software and
the operating systems are proprietary developments.
Mobile devices also have other communication interfaces
like WLAN and Bluetooth, and malicious software exists
that only uses these interfaces for spreading. Consequently,
devices can be imagined that do not have a connection
i.e., do not contain an operator-
to a mobile network,
controlled smartcard, but are attackable by mobile malware.
Fortunately, all relevant mobile device operating systems
provide the interface to the mobile network together with
the local communication interfaces. That is why the intuitive
deﬁnition from the beginning still holds.
B. Deﬁnition & Discussion
A more rigid deﬁnition follows now as well as a dis-
tinction concerning the possible security mechanisms. We
deﬁne an MNO smartcard as follows: an MNO smartcard is
a smartcard inside the mobile device that is controlled by a
mobile network operator. Whenever this term is used in this
paper, it can be used for all smartcards in mobile devices
that are controlled by an MNO regardless of the actually
used technology. A second important term is smartphone,
which we deﬁne as follows: a smartphone contains an MNO
smartcard with a connection to a mobile network. Moreover,
it has an operating system that can be extended with third-
party software.
The term “smartphone” as one word is chosen inten-
tionally. It
is supposed to denote that not only “smart
phones” are under attack, but that the smartphone with its
two main properties deﬁnes a class of attack targets and
protection needs, which takes place in a setting with mobile
devices connected to the network over a wireless link and
a more centralized environment of the network operators.
Additional properties of these smartphones can be found
in the literature [16]. We sometimes use the term mobile
device as a synonym for smartphone within this paper.
Smartphones offer various services to its users. Popular is
messaging as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia
Messaging Service (MMS). They use certain protocols that
are explained in the literature [17] and we discuss the
security aspects of them later.
In contrast to mobile devices, traditional computers are
called hereafter ordinary computers. When their ﬁxed loca-
tion is emphasized, they are called desktop computers.
C. Speciﬁcs of Mobile Devices
A central question for the topic smartphone security is:
In what sense is research on the security of mobile devices
different from common security research? Is it possible to
transfer known security solutions from ordinary desktop
computers to mobile devices? Could it possibly be the same,
only with the additional word “mobile” in the title?
We argue that there are speciﬁcs of mobile device security
that justify independent research on this topic. We discuss in
the following unique features of mobile security compared
to ordinary computer security. They are the basis to novel
security mechanisms especially designed for mobile devices
and their infrastructure, and these mechanisms cannot be
transferred from existing computer security solutions. In

Communication (NFC). In this case, the required proximity
to the receiver of the payment enhances the security and
makes these attacks unlikely compared with directly using
the mobile network cost-creating functionality. When this
feature becomes more widespread and more standardized,
we expect a strong increase of incidents.
2) Network Environment: The speciﬁc network envi-
ronment consists of the three aspects strong connection,
ﬁrmware update process, and remote device management.
Strong Connection: Strong connection means the pres-
ence of the MNO and its inﬂuence on the device. Different
from ordinary computers where the network provider almost
always has no inﬂuence on the user’s machine, the MNO
owns the smartcard inside the mobile phone. Furthermore,
the smartcard is a trusted device. It is possible to create
trusted applications on the mobile phone with enhanced
security. Although TPMs (Trusted Platform Module) appear
in mobile devices, it remains an open question how to easily
bootstrap trust between MNO and TPM.
Firmware Update Process: The process of updating
the ﬁrmware of mobile devices changed rapidly during the
last few years. A few generations of mobile phones ago, an
update of a ﬁrmware could only be done in a local setting,
possibly only by the device manufacturer himself. With the
rise of smartphones and extensible operating systems, more
sophisticated hardware architectures have been introduced.
These new architectures enable ﬁrmware or third-party soft-
ware updates remotely.
A user typically notices such feature changes as remote
conﬁguration updates, for example, when MMS or WAP
(Wireless Application Protocol) settings are pushed to the
Even though remote updates are possible today and up-
dates nowadays do not differ much from ordinary computers,
updating mobile devices remains a challenging task. If not
connected to a host computer on a regular basis, an update
process has to use the expensive wireless interface.
Updating the ﬁrmware over the air is an important func-
tionality to update vulnerable parts of the mobile device’s
operating system. It is also a critical feature, because most
update procedures cannot be interrupted without damaging
the device. Instead of a complete ﬁrmware update, the ex-
change of single ﬁles of the operating system’s ﬁle structure
is better suited. This is especially true in terms of wireless
communication and device resource costs.
An additional aspect is the entity that starts the update.
This has traditionally been the mobile network operator, but
only recently manufacturers started to control the ﬁrmware
update process themselves (examples are iOS and Android).
