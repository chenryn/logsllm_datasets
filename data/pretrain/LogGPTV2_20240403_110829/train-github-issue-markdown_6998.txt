Currently I have an `Input` sitting inside the `label` of a `Chip`, and the
way "backspace" is handled causes several issues with this text input. I'm
able to stop the `onDelete` function being called, but cannot fix the fact
`Input` is never getting an event.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I would prefer `Chip` not handle "backspace" `keydown` events, but if this is
desired functionality, being able to override the `onKeyDown` event
unconditionally would suffice.
## Current Behavior
The default event is prevented and the `onChange` function is never called.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
I spun this up to demo the issue:

## Context
I'm creating a filter system for a desktop-only application, where the filters
are editable and represented by `Chip`s. Currently these filters are pretty
simple, so editing them inline is pretty clean and simple from a user
perspective.
