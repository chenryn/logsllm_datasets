### Conversation Summary and Technical Details

**Buyer:**
- I will have 1-2 friends from the US to test the function.
- I tested with Firefox and Chrome.

**NEW VERSION 2.8.2 AVAILABLE NOW:**
- If 'Enable Bad Traffic' is not checked, it will not allow Chrome and other browsers to visit the page. Only IE, Firefox, and Opera are allowed.
- The issue might be because you are using a Mac; this is for Windows only.
- If you have already visited the site, your IP will be in the database, and it will show a 404 error. Clear the stats to visit again.
- Unnecessary to have duplicate victims.

**Buyer:**
- Tried http://87.98.218.204/cn/index.php in IE, but it failed and showed a "Not Found" message.
- Asked for any documentation or a handle to call the seller by.

**NEW VERSION 2.8.2 AVAILABLE NOW:**
- Go to 'Settings' and upload the executable.
- Send traffic to http://87.98.218.204/cn/index.php.
- Asked which browser the buyer was using (Firefox).
- Confirmed that it was working on their end.

**Technical Details:**
- **Main Menu:**
  - Referrer
  - Origin of Countries
  - Blacklist Check
  - Build a Downloader
  - Clear Statistics
- **Clear Stats:** Allows the administrator to clear all statistics of the latest malware deployment.
- **Mission 2: Analysis and Deobfuscation:**
  - The site is ready at http://87.98.204/cn/index.php.
  - A payload (calc.exe) was uploaded:
    - Size: 112KB (114688 bytes)
    - MD5: 829e4805b0e12b383ee09abdc9e2dc3c
  - Visited the site in a VM, and a 114KB executable was downloaded.
  - Automated scans:
    - Wepaweb: Failed
    - Jsunpack: Succeeded
    - Detailed report: http://jsunpack.jeek.org/dec/go?report=f5b4710bb96e4b9d4ea440164c2d70120299c3a3
    - Password: "infected"

**Further Discussion:**
- **Buyer:**
  - Asked if more obfuscation is supported.
  - Mentioned that Wepaweb cannot analyze it, but Jsunpack can.
- **Crimepack 3.0-Delta available:**
  - Crimepack itself does not add extra obfuscation due to Kaspersky detection.
  - Working on improvements and will provide an evaluation panel soon.
  - Planning to add exploits for AIM, Firefox 3.5, and some ActiveX controls.
  - Considering a development framework to include and manage custom exploits.

**Manual Kungfu:**
- **Syntax Error:**
  - Document has no properties.
  - Declare a variable type for `zelslxls` instead of using it as an ID.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    // Original:
    eS8kz…
    var zelslxls = “………”;
    After executing the replace function, it is document.getElementById(“zeslxls”).innerHTML, we simply put it as “zelslxls” as it is no longer an id of <tag>.
    // Original:
    var mzmiycr=HeJKUePIhDF(document['pndqsqp gpndqsqpepndqsqptpndqsqpEpndqsqplpndqsqpepndqsqpmpndqsqpepndqsqpnpndqsqptp ndqsqpBpndqsqpypndqsqpIpndqsqpdpndqsqp'.replace(/pndqsqp/g,'')]("zeslxls").innerHTML);
    // Deobfuscated:
    var mzmiycr=HeJKUePIhDF(zeslxls);
    ```
- **Replace Executed Result:**
  - Replace "search" with a specific value.
  - Replace `document.location.href` with a URL.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    // Original:
    znknvsh['wklxnerswklxnerewklxne rarwklxnerch'.replace(/wklxner/ g,'')](zdiubxv);
    var mcstfpj=znknvsh.search(zdiubxv);
    // Modified:
    return "http://www.google.com";
    ```
