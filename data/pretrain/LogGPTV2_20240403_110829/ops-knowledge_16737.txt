User: Trying to learn how to use the rpm-python module (i.e. "import rpm" on RHEL5). I can't find any tutorials that are complete or recent. Specifically regarding how to install and manage rpm's on a system. Anyone?
Assistant: If you are on RHEL then you could seriously consider using the yum APIs instead of rpm-python directly ... the API is much easier to use.
