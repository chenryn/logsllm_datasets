### Problem
When going through the "Image tutorial" on Firefox or Edge, when you try
downloading the image of the stinkbug, it will only download as a `webp` file
and there is no option to download as `png`. That is even clicking the "View
Image" and trying to save it. Below is trying to save the image in Firefox.

This is a problem for introductory students, trying to use this tutorial and
learning how to read tutorials. They believe they are doing something wrong
and wouldn't be sure how to convert it. As a more advanced user, I still could
not find out how to make it a `png` through the tutorial page.

  * Image Link: https://matplotlib.org/_images/stinkbug.png (may say `png` but downloading it is as `webg`)
Operating System: Windows 10 Pro
### Suggested Improvement
The image needs to be updated to a `png` and maybe a direct link to download
the image (the latter is not as important).
If there is a way to do that with a module, that might be cool to include, but
just an idea. I can provide more information if necessary.
