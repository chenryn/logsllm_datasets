## 4.2 Maltego

Maltego is an open-source intelligence and forensics application that facilitates the timely mining and gathering of information, presenting it in an easily understandable format. One of its most compelling features for visual social network analysts is the "Local Transforms" feature. Local Transforms are applications that run locally (on the same PC as Maltego) and produce output that results in entities within your graph. These transforms can be coded in almost any language, provided they adhere to the specified format.

This capability allows users to mine and graph virtually any data source, making Maltego readily extendable for social network analysis through APIs often available on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.

## 5. Case Study #1: Tony Hawk's Twitter Treasure Hunt

### 5.1 Background
In 2009 and 2010, US skateboarder and sports hall of famer Tony Hawk used Twitter to organize a worldwide treasure hunt. He enlisted some of his followers to hide packages containing skateboards and other goodies in cities and towns around the world. Clues were tweeted, and his followers used these clues to find the packages.

### 5.2 Objective
Create a Google map showing the locations where #THTH (Tony Hawk Twitter Hunt) packages were hidden, who hid them, who found them, and any associated pictures.

### 5.2.1 Hypothesis
People who hid packages would tweet the finders with a note of congratulation.

### 5.2.2 Null Hypothesis
People who hid packages would not tweet the finders with a note of congratulation.

### 5.2.3 Approach
Associate the finders of skateboards with the hiders and determine the geographical locations of both.

### 5.3 Starting Assumptions
1. People who hid packages were all 'followers' of @HidingIt.
2. Tony tweeted each find, and these tweets contained the word 'Found' and typically the location.
3. Everyone was encouraged to use the hashtag #THTH when communicating about the event.

### 5.4 Deriving a Starting Node
In version 2.x of Maltego, we need to derive a starting Twitter node (AffiliationTwitter). This can be done by:
1. Dragging the Phrase icon from the left-hand menu and dropping it in the main map window.
2. Double-clicking on the text 'Phrase' and typing the phrase "@HidingIt".
3. Searching for tweets containing "@HidingIt" to derive a Twitter entity or "AffiliationTwitter".

### 5.5 Data Acquisition
Maltego has built-in Twitter transforms, but as of version 2.02, some suffer from limitations of the Twitter Search API. To acquire data, I constructed local transforms using the Twitter REST API.

### 5.5.1 Pseudo Code
- Get followers of @hidingit.
- Get all tweets written by USER within a specified time range and extract the @username.

### 5.6 Visual Graph Exploration
The resultant graph shows the connections between people mentioned in Tony's tweets and the followers of @HidingIt. By pruning the graph, we can focus on the most interconnected nodes.

### 5.7 What Does This Tell Us?
The graph reveals that @tonyhawk, @SweetJerome, @Steven_Gill, and @TheSuggmeister were active participants in the #THTH event. This information can lead to further insights, such as reading blogs and stories related to the event.

## 6. Case Study #2: Facebook Scam Investigation

### 6.1 Special Note - Facebook Terms of Service
At the time of this paper's publication (August 2, 2010), Facebook's Terms of Service required user consent for data collection. Familiarize yourself with these terms to avoid breaches.

### 6.2 Background
In 2010, a series of scams associated with one email address and a valid postal address in Europe attracted the attention of a local police force. We used visual data analysis to gather intelligence based on publicly available information.

### 6.3 Information We Started With
- Email address of the scammer (Bob)
- IP addresses of the scammer
- Name and address of the recipient of the stolen goods (Alice)

### 6.4 Determine Location of Scammer
A WHOIS lookup placed the IP addresses in Lagos, Nigeria.

### 6.5 For Both Recipient & Scammer, Determine if They Exist on Social Network Sites
Using Facebook transforms, we generated possible results for the recipient of the goods. Alice, based in Newcastle, had many Facebook friends in Nigeria.

### 6.6 Examine Location of People
By extracting profile locations, we narrowed down the search to one person. Further analysis of wall posts and photos revealed more details about the scam.

### 6.7 Drill Down in Details
We performed additional analysis outside of Maltego, which exposed photos and comments supporting the scam assumptions.

### 6.8 But Is One of These Guys the Scammer?
It was challenging to link the scammer's email to a Facebook profile. Social engineering techniques were used to get the scammer to post a Facebook update, eventually linking the scammer to the recipient of the goods.

### 6.9 Result
The investigation successfully linked the scammer to the recipient and exposed their social relationships, leading to the identification of more individuals involved in the scams.

## 7. Conclusion
Visual data analysis can be effectively employed to guide researchers, complementing other data mining and analysis methods. Tools like Maltego, with access to social network APIs, make it possible to generate and analyze complex graphs with relative ease and at low cost. Researchers can quickly identify key actors in a social network graph and uncover significant relationships with more in-depth knowledge.

## 8. Future Development
Further exploration of data visualization in social networks should consider:
- Collaboration with social network sites to ensure compliance with Terms of Service.
- Creation of a full set of social network transforms.
- Development of transforms to explore photo-sharing sites.
- Linking to private data sources, such as corporate databases and police records.
