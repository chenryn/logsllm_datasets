4.2 Maltego
Maltego allows the user to combine a variety of data 
mining tasks, including ‘Named Entity Recognition’ 
in an interactive visual context.
“Maltego is an open source intelligence and 
forensics application. It will offer you timous mining 
and gathering of information as well as the 
representation of this information in a easy to 
understand format.”27
 Arguably its most compelling feature the the visual 
social network analyst is it’s ‘Local Transforms’ 
feature:
“Local Transforms are just that, transforms that run 
locally (the same PC that Maltego is running on). 
These are applications that when called will produce 
output which results in entities within your graph. 
They can be coded in practically anything as long as 
they stick to the specification.”28
This gives the user the ability to mine and graph 
virtually any data source.  This tool is therefore 
readily extendable to perform social network analysis 
through the API’s often present with social networks 
such as Twitter and Facebook.

5. Case Study # 1
5.1 Background
In 2009 and 2010, US skateboarder and sport hall of famer, Tony Hawk, used Twitter to run a world wide 
treasure hunt (twitter hunt). Tony enlisted some of his twitter followers (tweeps) to hide packages containing 
skateboards and other goodies in cities and towns around the world. He then tweeted clues, which his remaining 
tweeps used to hunt down the packages
5.2 Objective
Create a Google map of the locations that #THTH (Tony Hawk Twitter Hunt) packages were hidden in, who hid 
them, who found them and any pictures associated with the hide and the find
5.2.1 Hypothesis
People who hid packages would tweet the finders of the packages with a note of congratulation.
5.2.2 Null Hypothesis
People who hid packages would NOT tweet the finders of the packages with a note of congratulation.
5.2.3 Approach
Associate the finders of skateboards with the hiders of the skateboard and determine geographical location of the 
hider and finder.
5.3 Starting Assumptions:
1.
People who hid packages were all ‘followers’ of @HidingIt.
2.
Tony tweeted each find and each of those tweets contained the word ‘Found’ and typically where it was 
located.
3.
Finally, everyone was encouraged to use the twitter hashtag #THTH when communicating on the topic.
5.4 Deriving a Starting Node
Note: In v2.x of the product, we have to derive a starting twitter node (AffiliationTwitter).  i.e. We can’t just 
plonk @HidingIt onto our map and have Maltego figure out that it’s an AffiliationTwitter. I achieved this by  
following these steps
1.
Drag the Phrase icon from the left hand menu and dropping it in your main map window
2.
Double click where you see the text ‘Phrase’
3.
Start typing the phrase you wish to search for,
in this case “@HidingIt”.
Figure 5.1: Putting phrase on the map
8
4. Next, find all the tweets which contain the text “@hidingIt” (Figure 5.2). We do this because we’ll later be 
able to derive a twitter entity or “AffiliationTwitter” from a tweet (Figure 5.3)
Figure 5.2 Searching for tweets containing “@HidingIt”
Figure 5.3 Searching for tweets containing “@HidingIt”
9
5. Now we can generate an AffiliationTwitter (Figure 5.5) by running a “convert to Affiliation Twitter” 
transform.
Figure 5.4 Converting a tweet to the Twitter user who sent it.
Figure 5.5 An “Affliation Twitter”

5.5 Data Acquisition:  
Maltego has built in Twitter transforms, but as of version 2.02 a number of them suffer from problems caused by 
known limitations of the Twitter Search API. To acquire data from Twitter, I therefore constructed local 
transforms to use the Twitter REST API’s.

9. Repeat the step to generate a graph of people Tony mentioned in his tweets AND all the people they 
referenced in their tweets

5.5 What does this tell us?
So what does this actually tell me. Well, it tells me that even if I hadn’t been following the #THTH event, I can 
see that the following were pretty active talkers/talkee’s about #THTH in comparison to others
•
@tonyhawk (obviously),
•
@SweetJerome (Tony’s helper and all-round generally awesome dude),
•
@Steven_Gill (read his story here) and
•
@TheSuggmeister (yours truly)
If you (with no knowledge of the event) had determined this, you’d probably have drilled down to my blog and 
read the articles that myself and @Steven_Gill wrote. You’d have also been able to follow the links on my blog 
and read other hider/finder stories.  You’d also have figured out that @SweetJerome pretty much ran the event 
for @tonyhawk.  Just with these 4 pieces of information, you’d probably know everything about the #THTH 
event you could ever possibly want to know.

6. Case Study # 2
This case study varies from the previous as it focuses on Facebook rather than Twitter.  Generally speaking, 
“tweets” are public, where as many Facebook users limit access to interesting details to “friends”.  Therefore, it 
is highly likely that the first task must be to win the confidence of the people you wish to enumerate.
6.1 Special Note - Facebook Terms of Services
At the date of publishing this paper (2nd August 2010), Facebook Terms of Services were clear that collecting 
users data first requires their consent.  You are strongly advised to familiarize yourself with the terms of service 
as Facebook take breached of Terms Of Service very seriously.
6.2 Background
In 2010 a series of scams associated with one email address and a valid postal address in Europe attracted the 
attention of a local police force.  Together with the local police force, we used visual data analysis as part of a 
tool kit in gathering intelligence based on publicly available information.
6.3 Information we started with
• Email address of scammer (Bob)
• IP Addresses of the scammer
• Name & address of the recipient of the stolen goods (Alice)
6.4 Determine location of scammer
A whois lookup put the addresses in Lagos, Nigeria.  (41.220.....)
6.5 For both recipient & scammer determine if the person exists on social network sites.
Facebook transforms, such as those written as a proof of concept by Dominic White, would quickly be able to 
generate 3 possible results for the recipient of the goods.
Figure 6.1 Example Person to Facebook transform
18
Figure 6.2 Facebook to Friends transform (note, only showing first 12 results)
6.6 Examine location of people
Another local transform to extract profile location could quickly narrow this search down to one.
Alice, based in “Newcastle” has a significant number of Facebook friends in Nigeria. 
19
Figure 6.3 - Example Facebook to Location local transform
6.7 Drill down in details
It’s possible to narrow the result set down further based on information within wall-posts and photo’s for each 
Nigerian “friend”.  We performed this outside of Maltego.
This stage alone exposed some fascinating results. Photo’s which seemed to feature hoards of stolen goods and 
comments supporting these assumptions.
6.8 But is one of these guys the scammer?
This was difficult to ascertain as the scammers email address wasn’t associated with his Facebook profile. 
A variety of techniques could be employed to expose any links, but the most expedient is to socially engineer the 
scammer to post a Facebook update.
20
6.9 Result
Within a short amount of time it was possible to link the scammer to the recipient of the goods and expose social 
relationships. From here it was possible to broaden the search identifying more and more people actively 
involved in scams.

7. Conclusion
Data can certainly be analyzed non-visually, but 
visual data analysis can be effectively employed to 
point a researcher in the right direction.
Visual data analysis should not be viewed as a 
substitute for other methods of data mining and 
analysis, but as a complimentary practice.
Access to social networks data through API’s and 
extendable visualization tools such as Maltego means 
that it is already possible for organizations and 
individuals to generate and analyze complex graphs 
with relative ease and at relatively low cost.
With little knowledge of the data set, a researcher can 
quickly identify key actors in a social network graph.
With more knowledge of a data set, a researcher can 
use interactive data visualization and other 
complementary techniques to uncover obscure, yet 
significant relationships.
As interfaces to data become more ubiquitous, 
individuals and organizations, both good and bad 
will be able to mine social data with ever greater 
ease.
8. Future Development
This paper has aimed to present possibilities. 
Individuals, organizations and agencies wishing to 
further explore data visualization in the context of 
social networks should give thought to;
• Collaboration with social network sites to ensure 
operation within an agreed Terms of Service.
• Creation of a full set of social network transforms. 
• Creation of transforms to explore photo sharing 
site.
• Linking to private data sources (e.g. corporate 
databases, police records).
