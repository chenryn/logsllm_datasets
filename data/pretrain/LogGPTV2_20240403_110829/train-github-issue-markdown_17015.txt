When providing a ColumnElement itself into .group_by()/.order_by() the query
compiler does not automatically quote the reference to that producing a query
that in some circumstances becomes invalid (for example in case there are
columns with the same name as the ColumnElement's label within the query).
This became an issue at 1.0.0 (and not resolved in 1.0.1)
