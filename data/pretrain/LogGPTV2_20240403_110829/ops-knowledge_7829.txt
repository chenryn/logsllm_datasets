User: Does anyone know an alternative to ALSA that can be used on windows, with gstreamer, and how to install it, and where to find python bindings for it if it needs it?
thanks xxx
Assistant: SDL does a decent job of abstracting sound interfaces in a platform-independent way. PyGame contains an interface to SDL and works on many platforms. Such abstraction, of course, sets many limitations, but maybe it will still do for you.
