used a similar methodology to ours (i.e., Mechanical Turk partic-
ipants and use of role playing to create an email account pass-
word) [11, 28, 29]. Although these passwords were collected un-
der similar methods to ours, some differences exist. We identified
primary differences that could have potentially impacted partici-
pants’ passwords, which included when data was collected and the
password-creation interface that participants created passwords
under. We attempted to understand how these differences related
to our new findings by comparing the character-class composition
and length of passwords collected in each study.

We find that more passwords contain multiple character classes
over time. Part of this appears to be due to the password meter
used to collect passwords in each study. Comparing 2016 study

Which of the following best describes your approach to creating your password in this study?
(cid:35) I reused a password that I currently use, or previously have used, for a different account.
(cid:35) I modified a password that I currently use, or previously have used, for a different account.

(cid:35) I created an entirely new password, and I used a different approach than I normally do.

In general, I am confident in my ability to create strong passwords.
The following questions refer only to the colored bar that measures the strength of your password (highlighted inside pink
box).
The colored bar helped me create a stronger password.
The colored bar was informative.
It’s important to me that the colored bar gives my password a high score.
Because of the colored bar, I created a different password than I would have otherwise.

The following questions refer only to the text feedback that measures the strength of your password (highlighted inside green
box).
Figure 9: PGS3 NN guess numbers for passwords containing
exactly one, two, three, and four class(es), subsetted from
passwords created under 1c8, 3c8, and 4c8 policies in Experi-
ment 1. Each of these sets contains differing number of pass-
words; we plot confidence intervals to reflect how this im-
pacts guess curve estimations. The 95% confidence interval
for passwords containing exactly one class is large due to the
small number of 1c8 passwords that contained exactly one
class.
passwords containing exactly three characters or four characters
at around the same rate, but guesses passwords containing exactly
one or two classes at a much faster rate. In other words, we find
evidence that passwords containing three or four character classes
tend to be stronger than those containing one or two classes. Simi-
larly, in Experiment 1 we found that character-class requirements,
when combined with minimum-strength requirements, do impact
resulting password guessability.
Nonetheless, we still recommend avoiding character-class re-
quirements. Users tend to find these requirements annoying and,
given an effectively designed password meter, many will incorpo-
rate multiple classes anyway of their own accord. Other types of
policy requirements, including minimum-strength and minimum-
length requirements, annoy users less, have a larger potential effect
on resulting password guessability, and can be configured more
granularly to achieve a desired security level.

1. Participant consent
[consent form]
2. Part 1 instructions
In this study you will be asked to create a password and fill out a 3-minute survey for a 55 cent payment. We will contact
you to come back a few days later to try to use your password to log in again and fill out another survey for a 70 cent
bonus payment.
Imagine that an online account that you care a lot about, such as your main email account, is requiring that all users
change their passwords. We will ask you to use this password in a few days to log in again, so it is important that you
remember your new password. Please take the steps you would normally take to create and remember your important
passwords, and protect this password as you normally would protect your important passwords. Please behave as you
would if this was your real password! NOTE: This password is only being used for the purpose of this study and you should
not use a password that you use for your actual email account.
