### Query Regarding Glide 3.8.0

**Question:**
Is there a callback provided by the `Glide` library that is triggered when all images have finished loading in an `Activity` or `Fragment`? We need to perform certain actions once all images are loaded.

**Additional Information:**
- If such a callback does not exist, could you provide guidance on how to implement one?
- I have reviewed issue #1440, but I would prefer to avoid using reflection as this code will be included in the APK.

**Desired Outcome:**
- A method or approach to determine when all images have been fully loaded, without resorting to reflection.
