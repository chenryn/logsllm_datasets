Glide 3.8.0
Is there a callback provided by `Glide` library when loading of all the images
are completed for an `Activity` or `Fragment`? We want to take certain actions
when that is done.
If not, any pointers how to get that callback.
I have seen #1440, but I would like to completely avoid reflection since it
will be part of shipped code within APK.
