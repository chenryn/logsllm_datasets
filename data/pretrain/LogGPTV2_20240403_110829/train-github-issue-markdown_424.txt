The auto-generated links are not functioning correctly, as all Google-provided links lead to a "Not Found" page.

For example, the broken link from Google:
```
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html
```

The correct, working link is:
```
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html
```

Notice that the working link includes an additional `/reference` segment.
