User: How to monitor system resource usage and diagnose performance issues on a Linux server?
Assistant: To monitor the resource usage of a Linux server and diagnose performance issues, you can do the following: 1. View system resource usage: - top command: Displays the running processes in the system and sorts them by their CPU usage. You can check the system load and process status with the top command. - vmstat command: Display virtual memory statistics, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O usage, process waiting queue, etc. - free command: Display system memory usage. - iostat command: Displays the disk I/O behavior of the system, including disk usage, throughput, response time, etc. - sar command: collect system resource usage information, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O behavior, etc. You can use this command to create and view historical performance data. 2. Identify performance bottlenecks in the system: - top command: View the CPU usage and CPU usage of processes in the system. - iostat command: View the usage of disk I/O in the system. - netstat command: View network connection usage. - pidstat command: View CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage in a process. 3. Diagnose system performance issues: - dmesg command: Diagnose system logs and error messages by reading kernel environment variables. - strace command: trace system calls and signals of a process to examine the behavior and performance of the process. - lsof command: View open files and processes to find locked files or folders. - tcpdump command: View the traffic and packets transmitted by the network to find problems and analyze network performance.
