It would be convenient to have the ability to drag a tab out of the current window, which would automatically open it in a new window. Currently, the process requires first opening a new window and then dragging the tab into that new window, which is less efficient.

I am using Windows 8.1, and I'm not sure if this behavior differs on other operating systems.
