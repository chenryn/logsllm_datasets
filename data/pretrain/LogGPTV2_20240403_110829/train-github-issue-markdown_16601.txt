Replicating example
    In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame([[1,2],[3,4]],columns=pd.CategoricalIndex(list('AB')))
    In [2]: df.describe()
    AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'value_counts'
The behaviour in this notebook seems like a bug to me. This is pandas 0.17.0.
In it, `g` and `gcat` are the results of two `df.groupby(['medium',
'artist']).count().unstack()` operations. The only difference is that one of
those operations is on `df` where one of the columns that the `groupby`
operates over has been converted to Categorical.
`g` and `gcat` behave very differently. I've tried to pin this down to the
exact operation in the split-apply-combine that causes the problem without
much luck.
Slicing a column out of `g` returns a Series as expected, while slicing a
column out of `gcat` returns a DataFrame (see cells 4 and 5).
`g.describe()` works as expected, but `gcat.describe()` raises the exception
    AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'value_counts'
and `g['painting'] + g['sculpture']` works as expected but `g['painting'] +
g['sculpture']` raises
    Exception: Data must be 1-dimensional
