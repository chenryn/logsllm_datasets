User: How to build and configure a highly available cluster system, what related technologies do you need to know?
Assistant: Building and configuring a highly available cluster system requires mastering the following related technologies: 1. Load balancing technology: Through load balancing technology, requests are evenly distributed to each node in the cluster to improve system performance and availability. Commonly used load balancing technologies include DNS load balancing, software load balancing, and hardware load balancing. 2. High-availability technology: High-availability technology means that the system can still provide services when failures or unexpected situations occur. In a cluster system, commonly used high-availability technologies include master-slave replication, inter-cluster load balancing, and virtual IP. 3. Data synchronization technology: Real-time synchronization of data in the cluster can ensure system availability and data consistency. Commonly used data synchronization technologies include MySQL multi-master replication, Galera, etc. 4. Automated operation and maintenance technology: Through automated deployment, configuration, monitoring and maintenance tools, management costs can be reduced and operation and maintenance efficiency can be improved. Commonly used automated operation and maintenance technologies include Ansible, Puppet, SaltStack, etc. 5. Containerization technology: Through containerization technology, cluster systems can be deployed in containers to improve system portability and maintainability. Commonly used containerization technologies include Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
