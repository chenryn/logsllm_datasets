Hi,
**TypeScript Version:** 1.8.5  
**Visual Studio** 2013
    interface Foo { a: string }
    interface Bar { b: string }
    getData(): T {
       return null;
    }
    var funcArray = [this.getData(), this.getData()];  //Inferred as (Foo | Bar)[]
Shouldn't this be inferred as `[Foo, Bar]`?  
Is this intended behavior? Looks reasonable since `funcArray` can be
explicitly typed to `[Foo, Bar]`
PS: This could be a duplicate of other issues for contextual typing, which
is/are already fixed (fix included in milestone 2.0?)
