User: Is there a way to do this, just by relying on the file's extension?
For example: os.system(filepath) opens the given filepath using the default application, but what is the executable's filepath?
Assistant: No. You can write assumptions into your program, which is what all developers do to handle these formats. It doesn't matter what extension a file has, it can be used as a format regardless.
Take for example an XML file. If you take that XML data and put it into a .txt file, or simply rename the .xml file to .txt, reading from that file and parsing the data within will still render XML formats.
