: &lt;&lt;EXPLANATION
If bash was compiled with --enable-net-redirections, it has the capability of
using a special character device for both TCP and UDP redirections. These
redirections are used identically as STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR. The device entries
are 30,36 for /dev/tcp:
  mknod /dev/tcp c 30 36
>From the bash reference:
/dev/tcp/host/port
    If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer
port number or service name, Bash attempts to open a TCP connection to the
corresponding socket.

  echo "Connection unsuccessful. Exit code: $MYEXIT"
