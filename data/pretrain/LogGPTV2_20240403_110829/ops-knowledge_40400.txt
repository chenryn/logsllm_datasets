I'm a big fan of IPython, particularly its notebook feature. Currently, I maintain a screen session with the notebook process running inside it. Could you guide me on how to add IPython's notebook engine/webserver to my system's (CentOS 5) startup procedures?

Certainly! Assuming you do not want to run the program as root, you can modify your system's startup configuration to launch the IPython notebook under a specific user account. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Edit the `/etc/rc.local` File:**
   - Open the `/etc/rc.local` file in a text editor with superuser privileges. For example, you can use `sudo nano //etc/rc.local`.
   - Add the following line before the `exit 0` line:
     ```sh
     su <username> -c "/usr/bin/ipython notebook --no-browser --profile <profilename> &"
     ```
     Replace `<username>` with the actual username and `<profilename>` with the desired IPython profile name.

2. **Verify the Path:**
   - Ensure that the path to the IPython executable is correct. You can check this by running the command:
     ```sh
     which ipython
     ```
   - If the output is different from `/usr/bin/ipython`, update the path in the `/etc/rc.local` file accordingly.

3. **Save and Exit:**
   - Save the changes and exit the text editor.
   - Make sure the `/etc/rc.local` file has the necessary execute permissions. You can set this with:
     ```sh
     sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
     ```

By following these steps, the IPython notebook will start automatically at boot time under the specified user account. This approach ensures that the notebook runs without requiring a graphical browser interface and uses the specified profile.
