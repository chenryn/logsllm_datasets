User: I love ipython, especially the notebook feature. I currently keep a screen session running with the notebook process in it.  How would I add ipython's notebook engine/webserver to my system's (CentOS5) startup procedures?
Assistant: I assume you don't want to run the program as root. So this is my modified version that runs as <username> (put in /etc/rc.local before the exit 0 line):
su <username> -c "/usr/bin/ipython notebook --no-browser --profile <profilename> &"
You can check to make sure your ipython is at that path with which ipython. Though you may just be able to get away with not putting the full path.
