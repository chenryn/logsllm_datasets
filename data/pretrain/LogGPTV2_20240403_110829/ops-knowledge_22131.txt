User:  company's web application is attacked by DDoS, how to quickly troubleshoot and respond to this attack?
Assistant: Here are some possible actions: 1. Monitor network traffic: Use network analysis tools to monitor network traffic and look for unusual bandwidth or traffic spikes. Identify the source of the information by observing which IP addresses are sending a large number of requests. 2. Block by IP address and user source: You can use firewalls or other network security devices to block malicious IP addresses or IP addresses in other blacklists, thereby restricting malicious traffic. Also consider restricting requests from certain geographic locations, such as blocking foreign IPs. 3. Strengthen load balancing: If feasible, you should consider increasing the number of load balancers and configuring them to defend against DDoS attacks. 4. Optimize web applications: do a good job of code review and vulnerability repair to prevent DDoS attacks from exploiting vulnerabilities. Optimizing web applications, tuning system configurations, and maximizing memory usage can reduce load and reduce the risk of web application crashes. 5. Support CDN service: Using CDN (Content Distribution Network) can realize global acceleration service, and can also play a role in defending against DDoS attacks. 6. Upgrade hardware and software: Continuously updating hardware devices and software systems can reduce system security vulnerabilities and enhance system carrying capacity, thereby reducing the risk of DDoS attacks.
