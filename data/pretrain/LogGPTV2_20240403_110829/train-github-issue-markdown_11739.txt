I am testing the fitting functionality of scipy. I noticed that I can fix
certain shape parametrs, fix the `loc` and `scale`, as well as give starting
points for `scale` and `loc`. Is it also possible to give starting positions
for shape parameters? Simply put I'd like to be able to specify `s` in the
following example
    from scipy.stats import lognorm
    scale = 1.0
    loc = 1.0
    s = 2.0
    data = lognorm(s=s, loc=loc, scale=scale).rvs(100)
    params = lognorm.fit(data, loc=loc, scale=scale)
    print(params)
