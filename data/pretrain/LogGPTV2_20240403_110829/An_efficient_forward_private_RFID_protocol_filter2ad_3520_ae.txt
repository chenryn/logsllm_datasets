**Collision Probability Bound**

For any fixed \( a \), the probability \( p_a \) of a collision involving \( T_j \) satisfies:
\[ p_a \leq (N - 1) \omega^2 2^{-m} + N \omega g \]
Thus, the overall collision probability \( p_c \) is bounded by:
\[ p_c \leq (N - 1) \omega^2 2^{-m} + N \omega g \]
This implies:
\[ p \leq (N - 1) \omega^2 2^{-m} + N \omega g + \omega (g + 2^{-l} + \epsilon (1 + 2q\epsilon)) \]
which concludes the proof.

**6. Efficient Implementation of PFP**

The previous section not only demonstrated that cryptographic hash functions are not essential for designing forward-private protocols but also provided concrete security bounds in the standard model. This allows for the selection of practical instances of both pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) and universal hash function families, meeting security requirements at a very low implementation cost. This section discusses some natural choices for the instantiation of these two primitives.

**6.1 Efficient Number Generators**

Recent developments in stream ciphers, driven by the eSTREAM project [13], have led to various efficient designs. A detailed survey of different designs from a hardware efficiency perspective is available in [16]. Grain v1, Trivium, and Decim are among the most promising. Grain v1 uses 1294 GE, Trivium requires 2580 GE, and Decim80 needs 2603 GE, all achieving an 80-bit security level. Since only a PRNG (or equivalently an IV-less stream cipher) is needed, it is not necessary to implement the key and IV loading of such stream ciphers. This allows for savings in gate complexity and the use of a PRNG input size of 160 bits.

A few PRNGs also exist with security proofs and efficient implementations. For example, the PRNG underlying QUAD [8] allows hardware implementations in less than 3000 GE for an 80-bit security level, as reported in [1].

**6.2 Efficient Universal Hash Functions**

An \( m \times l \) Toeplitz matrix \( M \) is a matrix where entries \( M_{i,j} \) satisfy \( M_{i_1, j_1} = M_{i_2, j_2} \) for indices such that \( i_2 - i_1 = j_2 - j_1 \). Thus, a Toeplitz matrix can be specified by its top row and first column alone. Given an \((l + m - 1)\)-bit vector \( v = (v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{l-1}, v_{c_1}, \ldots, v_{c_{m-1}}) \), we associate the Toeplitz matrix \( T_v \) with the first row \( (v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{l-1}) \) and the first column \( (v_0, v_{c_1}, \ldots, v_{c_{m-1}}) \).

It is well known [25] that Toeplitz mappings \( \{ x \mapsto T_v(x) \}_{v \in \{0,1\}^{l+m-1}} \) form a universal family of hash functions, and \( \{ x \mapsto T_v(x) + w \}_{v \in \{0,1\}^{l+m-1}, w \in \{0,1\}^m} \) form a strongly universal family of hash functions.

Given \( v \in \{0, 1\}^{l+m-1} \) and \( w \in \{0, 1\}^m \), the computation of \( T_v x \oplus w \) for \( x \in \{0, 1\}^l \) can be implemented using a shift register that successively describes each column of the matrix \( T_v \) and an accumulator initially containing \( w \). Depending on the bits of the public value \( x \), the current column of \( T_v \) is accumulated into \( w \) or not. This strategy requires \( m \) clock cycles, \( 12(m + l - 1) \) GE for the shift register, and \( 12m \) GE for the accumulator.

**6.3 Typical Parameter Values**

Let us estimate typical orders of magnitude for the parameters of the proposed RFID scheme: \( N \approx 2^{20} \) legitimate tags, \( q \approx 2^{25} \) maximum authentication exchanges launched (and potentially disturbed) by an adversary, and \( \omega \approx 2^{28} \) maximum (disturbed or undisturbed) authentications in the lifetime of a tag. These values are realistic if an authentication exchange typically takes more than 0.1 seconds and discards attacks requiring more than a year of continuous authentication exchanges of a single tag.

Our security theorems indicate that if the PRNG is strong enough and we consider adversaries with computing time upper-bounded by \( T \approx 2^{80} \), Toeplitz matrix sizes such as \( m = 86 \) and \( l = 38 \) lead to correctness, security, and privacy levels \( \epsilon_c, \epsilon_s, \) and \( \epsilon_p \) upper bounded by \( 2^{-10} \), and to an order of magnitude of \( 2500 \) GE for the Toeplitz matrix computations. This leads to an overall gate count of less than \( 4000 \) GE, including the PRNG computations if the stream cipher Grain v1 is used. Slightly less conservative parameter values result in an overall complexity of about \( 3000 \) GE.

**7. Conclusion**

We introduced a low-footprint, privacy-preserving RFID authentication protocol supported by strong provable security arguments. Our construction is based on less complex cryptographic building blocks than previous RFID protocols, and represents another illustration—in a context that has little to do with the well-known example of Carter-Wegman message authentication codes—of the advantages that may result, both in theoretical and practical terms, from the combined use of a strongly (or almost strongly) universal hash function family and a computationally secure component such as a pseudo-random number generator.

**Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 1**

We prove Theorem 1 by showing that, if for a given \( \lambda \geq 1 \) there exists an algorithm \( A \) able to distinguish the generator \( G_\lambda \) associated with \( \lambda \) iterations of \( g \) in time \( T' \) with an advantage of at least \( \epsilon \), then there is an algorithm \( B \) able to distinguish the generator \( g \) with an advantage of at least \( \epsilon \) and in time lower than \( T' + (\lambda + 1)T_g \). We use a classical proof technique relying on hybrid probability distributions.

For \( 0 \leq i \leq \lambda \), let \( D_i \) be the probability distribution over \( \{0, 1\}^{n + \lambda m} \) associated with the random variables:
\[ F^i(x) = (r_1, \ldots, r_{\lambda - i}, g_2(g_0^1(x)), \ldots, g_2(g_{i-1}^1(x))), \]
where \( r_j \) and \( x \) are random and independently uniformly distributed values in \( \{0, 1\}^{(k-1)n} \) and \( \{0, 1\}^n \) respectively. By convention, \( (r_1, \ldots, r_{\lambda - i}) \) is the empty string for \( i = \lambda \), and \( (g_2(g_0^1(x)), \ldots, g_2(g_{i-1}^1(x))) \) is the empty string for \( i = 0 \).

We see that \( D_0 \) is the uniform distribution over \( \{0, 1\}^{n + \lambda m} \), \( D_\lambda \) is the output distribution of \( G_\lambda \), and the \( D_i \) are intermediate between \( D_0 \) and \( D_\lambda \). Let \( p_i \) denote the probability that \( A \) accepts an input sequence distributed according to \( D_i \). The hypothesis about algorithm \( A \) amounts to assuming that \( A \) distinguishes between \( D_0 \) and \( D_\lambda \) with an advantage of \( \epsilon \), in other words, \( |p_0 - p_\lambda| \geq \epsilon \).

On input \( (u, v) \in \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^m \), algorithm \( B \) randomly selects an integer \( i \) such that \( 0 \leq i \leq \lambda - 1 \) and constructs the \( n + \lambda m \)-bit vector \( Z(u, v) \) defined as:
\[ Z(u, v) = (r_1, \ldots, r_{\lambda - i - 1}, v, g_2(g_0^1(u)), \ldots, g_2(g_{i-1}^1(u))). \]

If \( (u, v) \) is distributed according to the uniform distribution, then \( Z(u, v) \) is distributed according to \( D_i \). On the other hand, if \( (u, v) \) is distributed according to the output distribution of \( g \), that is, \( (u, v) = g(x) = (g_1(x), g_2(x)) \) for a uniformly distributed value \( x \), then \( Z(u, v) \) reads:
\[ Z(u, v) = (r_1, \ldots, r_{\lambda - i}, g_2(g_0^1(u)), \ldots, g_2(g_i^1(u)), g_{i+1}^1(u)) \]
and is distributed according to \( D_{i+1} \).

To distinguish the output distribution of \( g \) from the uniform distribution, algorithm \( B \) calls algorithm \( A \) with input \( Z(u, v) \) and outputs the value returned by \( A \). Hence, the advantage of \( B \) in distinguishing the output distribution of \( g \) from the uniform distribution is:
\[ \left| \Pr_{u,v} [B(u, v) = 1] - \Pr_x [B(g(x)) = 1] \right| = \left| \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=0}^{\lambda-1} p_i - \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=0}^{\lambda-1} p_{i+1} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{\lambda} (p_0 - p_\lambda) \right| \geq \frac{\epsilon}{\lambda}. \]

Thus, \( B \) distinguishes the generator \( g \) with an advantage of at least \( \epsilon \) and in time lower than \( T' + (\lambda + 1)T_g \).
