# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Detect URLs and make them clickable (open the URL in the default browser).
This is a convenience feature present in many other terminals.
I believe the value is self-evident, but here's a concrete use case example
regardless: when I run `yarn outdated` (Yarn is a package manager) it outputs
a repository/homepage URL for every listed package. I want to be able to click
one of those URLs to open the page quickly/easily and have a look at what has
changed in the new version of the package.
# Implementation details
  * Probably don't need to support anything more than text starting with `http://` or `https://`.
  * URLs that span multiple lines (due to being truncated by the window width) should be handled correctly.
  * There should probably be an indication that the URL is clickable, e.g. cursor change + underline on mouse hover.
  * Most other terminals require an alt or ctrl click, I presume to guard against accidental clicks when copying and so forth.
You can look at something like VS Code's terminal for inspiration. Again this
is all probably self-evident.
