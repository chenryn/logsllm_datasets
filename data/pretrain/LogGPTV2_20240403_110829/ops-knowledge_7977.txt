User: How to use the scheduled task function of the Linux system to regularly back up database files?
Assistant: 1. Install the scheduled task tools There are two types of scheduled task tools in the Linux system: cron and anacron. In general, cron is a widely used timing task tool, so we can use cron to back up database files regularly. Install cron using the following command: ``` sudo apt-get install cron ``` 2. Create a shell script First, we need to create a shell script to backup the database file. Here I take the backup of the MySQL database file as an example, the script code is as follows: ``` #!/bin/bash # Get the current time Now=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) # Define the backup file Storage path and file name BackupDir=/backup/db BackupFile=$BackupDir/mydb_$Now.sql # Execute the backup command mysqldump -u root -p password mydb > $BackupFile ``` We can save this script as backup.sh , and place it in a directory. 3. Create a scheduled task Now we need to create a scheduled task so that the system can automatically execute this backup script every day. Use the following command to open the editing interface of the cron timed task: ``` crontab -e ``` Add a line of code to set the timed task. For example, if you want to automatically back up the database file at 3 am every day, you can add the following code: ``` 0 3 * * * /bin/bash /path/to/backup.sh ``` In this code, the first Column 0 means the number of minutes is 0, the second column 3 means the number of hours is 3, and * is written in the positions of days, months, and days of the week, indicating that the backup script is executed every day. The last column is the absolute path to the backup script we created earlier. Press the Ctrl + X keys, then press the y key to save the changes. 4. Check whether the scheduled task is valid We can use the following command to view all the scheduled tasks of the current system: ``` crontab -l ``` If you see the scheduled task you created before, it means it has taken effect. Now you only need to wait for 3 o'clock in the morning every day, and the database file will be automatically backed up.
