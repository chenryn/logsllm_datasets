### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.7.4.1
  * Operating System version: MacOS
  * Java version: JDK1.8
### Steps to reproduce this issue
Quote the issue to continue question about _**Not friendly with the YAML
config**_.
**You can use any dynamic config center as Dubbo configuration provider( Must
be use other format to write your configuration, like YAML, XML, etc... ),
them you verify this issue.**
The one of example of about "Not friendly with the YAML config", you can found
that code in the class `org.apache.dubbo.config.AbstractInterfaceConfig`(
Version 2.7.4.1 ) , line 303 & 304 .
    Environment.getInstance().updateExternalConfigurationMap(parseProperties(configContent));
    Environment.getInstance().updateAppExternalConfigurationMap(parseProperties(appConfigContent));
You can not expect everyone have to use "Properties" format to write them
configurations, this code can not handling other format like YAML, so that
someone use other format like me have to customize own protocol by SPI for
handle the configuration parsing process.
My suggest is, do not write that dead code like "parseProperties".
Or, also can write a document to teach everyone to handling this situation if
someone use other format like me.
### Expected Result
Pull all config from remote config center ( like Nacos / Apollo ) and **parse
configuration in other formats successfully**.
### Actual Result
Parsing any format configurations as "Properties" format, and failure.
The configuration parsing process is unreasonable, that code only accept
"Properties" format.
