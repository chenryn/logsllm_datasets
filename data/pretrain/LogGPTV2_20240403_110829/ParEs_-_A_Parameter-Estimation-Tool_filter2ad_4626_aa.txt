## Abstract
This paper addresses the parameter estimation of lifetime distributions from available field data. The primary goal is to extend existing methodologies to be applicable in industrial practice and to integrate these into a tool that can be used by statistically unskilled users. The focus is on reliability analysis of car components, but the methodology is not limited to this domain. The tool supports various distributions relevant for reliability analysis, including a "bathtub" distribution that models behavior over different timescales. It can handle large datasets, clustered and suspended data, and employs adapted versions of linear regression and maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). Numerical stability, local and global optimization, and interval arithmetic are incorporated, along with methods for computing confidence intervals.

## 1. Introduction
Model-based reliability analyses require accurate input modeling. This paper focuses on estimating parameters of lifetime distributions from field data, motivated by the need for reliability analysis of car components. However, the results are applicable to other domains as well. Linear regression and MLE are well-known techniques, but we found them challenging to apply directly to our specific problems. 

Practical challenges include handling large and potentially incomplete or clustered datasets, ensuring numerical stability, and considering constraints on parameters. We also needed a distribution that captures failure characteristics over the entire lifecycle, including infant mortality and wear-out failures. For this, we constructed a "bathtub" distribution as a superposition of two Weibull distributions, which has six parameters. Existing tools, such as ExpertFit, do not address these issues, necessitating the development of a new tool.

Felix Engelhard's work was funded by a scholarship from the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the graduate school “Interdisziplinärer Entwurf verlässlicher Multitechnologie-Systeme.”

Linear regression, the most popular method, can be applied to all distributions except the bathtub distribution. We also focus on computing confidence intervals and addressing numerical issues. For the bathtub distribution, MLE is used to estimate the six parameters, and both local and global optimization algorithms are discussed.

To make these methods accessible to statistically unskilled users, we have integrated all algorithms into a GUI-based Java tool. This tool allows automatic access to field data, and the resulting parameters can be used as input for stochastic models, such as stochastic Petri nets, for further analysis.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
- Section 2 introduces the different types of distributions and the modes of data to be treated.
- Section 3 discusses linear regression.
- Section 4 covers MLE.
- Section 5 describes the tool and presents some application examples.
- Section 6 provides conclusions and outlines future work.

## 2. The Distributions and Types of Data to be Treated
This section introduces the different distribution types and the parameters to be estimated. Additionally, it explains the different modes of field data considered.

### 2.1 The Weibull Family
The Weibull distribution is widely used in reliability engineering. The two-parameter Weibull distribution has the cumulative distribution function (CDF):

\[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\alpha}\right)^\beta} \]

where \(\alpha\) is the characteristic lifetime and \(\beta\) is the shape parameter. The CDF, probability density function (PDF), and hazard rate of the Weibull distribution are shown in Figures 1 to 3.

The three-parameter Weibull distribution includes an offset \(x_0\):

\[ F(x) = \begin{cases} 
1 - e^{-\left(\frac{x - x_0}{\alpha - x_0}\right)^\beta} & \text{for } x > x_0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

The exponential distribution, a special case of the Weibull distribution with \(\beta = 1\), is appropriate for modeling random failures and is characterized by memorylessness.

### 2.2 The Bathtub Distribution
The bathtub distribution models the lifetime behavior of a component with infant-mortality, random, and wear-out failures. The name comes from the shape of its hazard rate curve, as shown in Figure 4.

The bathtub distribution is constructed as a superposition of two Weibull distributions, one for infant-mortality failures and one for wear-out failures. The CDF is given by:

\[ F(x) = p \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\alpha_1}\right)^{\beta_1}}\right) + (1 - p) \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\left(\frac{x - x_0}{\alpha_3 - x_0}\right)^{\beta_3}}\right) \]

for \(x > x_0\), and 0 otherwise. Here, \(p\) (with \(0 \leq p \leq 1\)) defines the weight of the terms.

The constraints for the parameters are:
- \(\alpha_1 > 0\)
- \(\beta_3 \geq 1\)
- \(1 > \beta_1 > 0\)
- \(\alpha_3 > x_0 \geq 0\)
- \(0 \leq p \leq 1\)

## 3. Linear Regression
Linear regression is the most popular method for parameter estimation and can be applied if the distribution can be transformed to a linear form. It is suitable for all distributions except the bathtub distribution. Besides point-estimation, we focus on computing confidence intervals and addressing numerical issues.

## 4. Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
For the bathtub distribution, MLE is used to estimate the six parameters. The challenges of point-estimation with local and global optimization algorithms are discussed, along with the computation of confidence intervals using these techniques.

## 5. The Tool
All algorithms have been integrated into a GUI-based Java tool, allowing automatic access to field data. The resulting parameters can be used as input for stochastic models, such as stochastic Petri nets, for further analysis. Some examples demonstrating the tool's application are presented.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, we have developed a tool for parameter estimation of lifetime distributions that addresses practical challenges and is accessible to statistically unskilled users. Future work will focus on further enhancements and broader applications.
