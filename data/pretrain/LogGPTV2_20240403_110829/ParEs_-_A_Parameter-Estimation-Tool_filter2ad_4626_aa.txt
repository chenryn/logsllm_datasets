Abstract— This paper deals with the parameter estimation
of lifetime distributions from available ﬁeld data. The focus
is on extending known methodology such that it is applicable
in industrial practice and to put this in a tool which can be
used also by statistically unskilled users. In the given case the
further aim is to do reliability analysis of car components, but the
methodology is not restricted to this application domain. The tool
covers a number of distributions relevant for reliability analysis
including a particular “bathtub” distribution able to represent
the behaviour over different timescales. Furthermore, it is able
to deal with large data volumes, clustered and suspended data
as typically encountered in practice. The parameter estimation
is based on adapted versions of linear regression and maximum-
likelihood-estimation. Numerical issues are taken care of, local
and global optimisation, and interval arithmetics is used. Methods
for the computation of conﬁdence intervals are also provided.
I. INTRODUCTION
An important prerequisite for model-based reliability anal-
yses is a valid input modeling. In this paper we address the
estimation of parameters of lifetime distributions from ﬁeld
data. The motivation of this work is to do reliability analysis
of car components, however, the results are not restricted
for this application domain. Linear regression and maximum-
likelihood-estimation (MLE) are two well-known techniques
for this purpose, the ﬁrst method is indeed in widespread
use in practice. In the context of our work, we found it hard
to apply both methods directly and therefore extended them
accordingly to make them applicable for our problems.
Practical challenges we are faced with and which are often
neglected are that the methods have to work efﬁciently and
numerically stable for huge data sets, and that data may
be incomplete (suspended items) or clustered. Furthermore,
constraints on parameters need to be considered. We also
need a distribution which represents the failure characteristics
over the whole lifetime including infant mortality and wear-
out failures. For this purpose, a “bathtub” distribution is
constructed as a superposition of two Weibull distributions.
This bathtub distribution has six parameters for which a
parameter estimation satisfying the previous criteria is also
a challenge. As these problems are not tackled by existing
approaches as for example the ExpertFit-tool [1], a new tool
had to be developed.

Linear regression as the most popular parameter estimation
method is considered ﬁrst and can be used if the distribution
can be transformed to a linear form. It can be applied to all
distributions given in Section II besides the bathtub distribu-
tion. Besides the point-estimation, there is also a focus on the
computation of conﬁdence intervals and the general problems
with this method, including numerical issues. For the bathtub
distribution, six parameters must be estimated with MLE.
The problems of the point-estimation with local and global
optimization algorithms are discussed and the computation of
conﬁdence intervals, using again local and global optimization
techniques, is investigated.
To allow also the statistically unskilled users the application
of these estimation methods, all algorithms have been incor-
porated into a GUI-based Java tool, which allows automatic
access to the ﬁeld data. The resulting parameters can then be
used as input for stochastic models (e.g., stochastic Petri nets)
for further model-based investigations.
The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows:
Section II introduces the different types of distributions and
the modes of data to be treated. Afterwards, in Section III,
linear regression is dealt with. In Section IV, the MLE is
investigated. In Section V the tool is described and some
examples showing the estimation results in some applications
are presented. Conclusion and further planned steps follow in
Section VI.
II. THE DISTRIBUTIONS AND TYPES OF DATA TO BE
TREATED
This section introduces the different distribution types and
the parameters to be estimated. Furthermore,
the different
modes of the ﬁeld-data that are considered are explained in
Section II-D.
A. The Weibull Family
The Weibull distribution is the most frequently used distri-
bution in reliability engineering. The original Weibull distri-
bution has the distribution function (CDF)
F (x) = 1 − e
−( x
α)β
with the two parameters α and β (which we therefore refer
to as the two-parameter Weibull distribution). α is called
the characteristical lifetime, which is deﬁned as the point,
where F (α) ≈ 0.632 = 63.2% of all parts have failed. The

distribution
The hazard rate of the Weibull
parameter β is referred to as the shape parameter, because
it deﬁnes, whether the distribution models infant-mortality
failures (β  1). The different
shapes of the CDF, the density (PDF) and hazard rate of the
Weibull distribution are shown in the Figures 1 to 3. In these
plots, the characteristical lifetime is set to 10.0. The density
of the Weibull distribution is then given as

correspondingly.
As an expansion of the two-parameter Weibull distribution,
there exists also a three-parameter form with the CDF

otherwise
The parameters α and β have the same meaning as in the
two-parameter case. The third parameter x0 serves as an
offset and models a guaranteed wear-out-failure-free lifetime.
For example, to get a short-circuit between two cables, the
insulation between the cables has to be rubbed through which
will take at least the time x0.
As a special case, also the exponential distribution is con-
tained in the Weibull family. Setting β = 1 and λ = 1
α one
comes to the distribution function F (x) = 1 − e
−λx with
hazard rate λ. This distribution is appropriate for modeling
random failures as they occur in electronic components and
is characterized by the memorylessness which simpliﬁes the
analysis of stochastic models signiﬁcantly.
B. The Bathtub Distribution
This distribution models the lifetime behaviour of a compo-
nent with infant-mortality, random, and wear-out-failures. The
name bathtub distribution is derived from the curve of the
hazard rate of this distribution which gives the bathtub-shape
that is shown in Fig. 4.
As it is obvious from Section II-A and recommended in [2],
this distribution can be built from the superposition (weighted
Fig. 4. The ideal bathtub-curve
sum) of two Weibull and one exponential distributions. But
doing this, one can see that, with one exception, the expo-
nential distribution, which should explicitly model the stable
lifetime, has nearly no inﬂuence on the shape of the overall
distribution. The reason for this is that the exponential part is
implicitly contained in the superposition of the two Weibulls,
so we decided to leave the exponential part out to reduce
the number of parameters to be estimated from eight to six
(one parameter for the exponential part itself and one for the
additional weight).
The CDF of the bathtub distribution is therefore given as
F (x) = p ·

otherwise
Here, the two-parameter Weibull is used to model infant-
mortality failures and the three-parameter Weibull models
wear-out-failures and p (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) deﬁnes the weight of the
terms (the index 2 has been omitted intentionally to remind
the reader that the explicit representation of the exponential
part is missing).
The exceptional case mentioned above in which the in-
ﬂuence of the exponential part would be visible is the case
with no wear-out-failures. But in this case, the second Weibull
distribution can be used with β3 = 1 to model the exponential
part, such that this special case is also covered. Hence, the
constraints for the parameters of the distribution are as follows:
α1 > 0,
β3 ≥ 1,
1 > β1 > 0, α3 > x0 ≥ 0
0 ≤ p ≤ 1.
