User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Need a way to run a script on windows boot up prior to a user logging in I need to run a custom script which runs when Windows boots up.I know its possible to run it when a user logs in but I want to run it when the system reboots i.e. prior to a user logging in.
The OS in question is Windows 2003 and Windows 2000

Assistant: You can use a Group Policy (or the local policy) to assign a startup script; you can configure it in the section Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Settings -&gt; Scripts (Startup/Shutdown).

You can also use Scheduled Tasks to configure a task to run at computer startup.
