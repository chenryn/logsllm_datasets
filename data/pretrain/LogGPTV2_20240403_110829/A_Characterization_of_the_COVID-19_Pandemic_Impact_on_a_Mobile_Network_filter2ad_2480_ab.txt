vided by Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)
Association (GSMA). This catalog maps the device TAC to a
set of device properties such as device manufacturer, brand
and model name, operating system, radio bands supported,
etc. With this information we are able to distinguish between
smartphones (likely used as primary devices by the mobile
users) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices.
Radio Network Topology. To account for potential struc-
tural changes in the radio access network (e.g., new site
deployments), we rely on a daily snapshot of the network
topology. This includes metadata (location and configura-
tion) and the status (active/inactive) of each cell tower.

Radio Network Performance. We rely on a commercial so-
lution the MNO deploys to collect the radio network perfor-
mance dataset. This dataset includes various KPI, including
average cell throughout, average user throughput, average
percentage of resources occupied, average number of users,
total volume of data traffic uplink/downlink and total volume
of conversational voice traffic. We collect this data hourly,
and aggregate at postcode level or larger granularity.
UK Administrative and Geo-demographic Datasets. We use
the National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL) dataset for
the UK as at February 2020 to group the postcode areas into
Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA). The NSPL is produced
by ONS Geography, providing geographic support to the
Office for National Statistics (ONS) and geographic services
used by other organisations. Furthermore, we use the latest
available Area Classification for Output Areas (2011 OAC) re-
leased in 2011, which represents a widely used public domain
census-only geodemographic classifications in the UK [15].
The 2011 OAC dataset summarizes the social and physical
structure of postcode areas using data from the 2011 UK Cen-
sus, and is updated every 10 years when census is performed
(the next one will be available in 2021).
2.3 Mobility Statistics
Since we are interested in analyzing mobility of people, we
focus on their primary devices. We use the TAC database
to filter only the devices that are smartphones (i.e., we drop
M2M devices such as smart sensors). We are also able to
separate the native users of the MNO, and drop the inter-
national inbound roamers from further analysis. Using the
signalling data-set described above, we then associate each
(anonymized) user to a radio tower throughout the time they
are connected to the MNO’s network. Based on the radio
network topology, we further attach to each radio tower its
geographic location (postal code and approximate coordi-
nates). With this, we then generate aggregated mobility sta-
tistics over six disjoint 4-hour bins of the day (e.g., 04:00AM -
08:00AM, 08:00AM - 12:00PM, 12:00PM - 04:00PM), and also
over the entire day (i.e., 24 hours time window).
For each user, we determine the total duration of time
they spend connected to every cell tower and select the top
20 towers. This allows us to identify all relevant places, as
previous studies have shown than more than three quarters
of people have between 3 to 6 important places, and in gen-
eral no more than 8 [17, 20]. After doing this initial filtering,
we obtain information regarding roughly 22 million native
users aggregated at postcode level or larger granularity (e.g.,
UTLA or geodemographic cluster).
Mobility Metrics. From the aggregated mobility statistics,
we focus on two metrics: entropy and radius of gyration. The
combination of both metrics gives a wide view of changes in
mobility: while entropy measures the repeatability of move-
ments, radius of gyration is an indication of the distance
travelled. The two metrics are independent, one could have
a high entropy with a reduced gyration, implying someone
that moves in a reduced physical space almost randomly; or,
on the contrary, have a low entropy with a large value of
gyration, implying someone that moves over a large area but
repeating the trajectories done. These metrics are computed
over a day for each individual and aggregated to obtain an
average value per day. Even if we compute these metrics per
user at cell tower level, we aggregated them at postcode or
larger granularity.
Entropy is a measure of the randomness of the movements
of an individual, and as such, a metric for the predictabil-
ity of movements[29]. From the variety of ways to calcu-
late entropy in mobility [29], we implemented a temporal-
uncorrelated entropy, that characterizes the heterogeneity
of visitation patterns. Formally:
(𝑝( 𝑗) log(𝑝( 𝑗))
(1)
with 𝑝( 𝑗) is the fraction of the time spent in the j𝑡ℎ visited
cell tower (being a proxy for the probability for the user to
be in that cell tower).
Radius of gyration is a key characteristic to model travelled
distance [17], and measures how far from the center of mass
the mass is located [2]. It is defined as the root mean squared
distance between the set of cell towers and its center of
masses. Formally:

where l𝑗 represents the location of the j𝑡ℎ visited cell tower,

l𝑐𝑚 represents the location of the center of mass of the user’s
𝑗=1{𝑡 𝑗l𝑗} and 𝑁 the total
trajectory, calculated as l𝑐𝑚 = 1

number of towers visited.

Home Detection. For our analysis, locating the home post-
code of the end-users is important when capturing their
mobility patterns. Home Detection algorithms are a specific
kind of a wider group of algorithms used to identify meaning-
ful places from mobility information. The main idea consists
in using some criteria to define time slots for home, work
and other activities and then use the mobility information
to identify these places [3, 14, 20, 26]. We estimate home
location for each user at postcode granularity. For this, we
use the cell tower to which the user connects more time
during nighttime hours (12:00 PM through 8:00 AM) for at

tual LAD population from census data.
least 14 days (not necessarily consecutive) during February
2020. With that filtering, we were able to determine the home
postal code for approximately 16 million users.
An inherent limitation with our inference is that the es-
timation of the home location distribution is influenced by
the market share of the MNO, and how it reflects the general
population. In order to validate its reliability, we assigned all
subjects to a Local Authority District LAD [12] according to
our home estimations, and compared with values of popula-
tion estimation from the Office for National Statistics (see
Figure 2). The result shows a linear relationship(𝑟 2 = .955),
thus validating the representativity of the dataset. The values
obtained are in line with the literature [28].
2.4 Network Performance Statistics
Using the general signalling dataset, we evaluate the average
time the users spend connected to the different RAT cells. We
find that 4G is the most popular RAT, with users spending
on average 75% of the time per day connected to 4G cells.
Thus, for the network performance statistics, we focus on
4G cells as they have the highest load out of the three RATs.
Based on the Radio Network Performance data feed, we
generate network performance statistics at the 4G radio cell
level. For each cell, we separate the following hourly perfor-
mance metrics: the Uplink (UL) and the downlink (DL) data
volume (the sum of all data transferred on all cell bearers
corresponding to QoS Class Identifier (QCI) from 1 to 8 in
each direction, UL and DL), average number of active DL
users (users with active data transmission in the DL buffer),
average radio load (as Transmission Time Interval (TTI)
utilization, representing the number of active User Equip-
ments (UEs) the LTE scheduler assigns per TTI), average
user DL throughput (as the average throughput over all users
active in the cell in one hour, considering all bearers corre-
sponding to QCI from 1 to 8), and time (number of seconds)
with active data per cell. We also extract hourly metrics per
cell specifically for conversational voice (separating only the
bearers corresponding to QCI value 1), namely: voice traffic
volume (total traffic with QCI equal to 1), average number of
simultaneous voice active users, and the UL and DL average
packet loss error rates.
For all the hourly metrics, we further aggregate them per
day and extract the (hourly) median value per cell. This al-
lows to capture one single value per metric per day, enabling
further analysis with the daily mobility metrics For each
of the radio cell, we attach the location metadata informa-
tion from the Radio Network Topology data feed. We further
merge this (at the postcode level) with the UK Administrative
and Geodemographic Datasets to append extra information
such as the geodemographic cluster for each radio cell.
3 MOBILITY
In this section we present how the evolution of the pandemic
and the social distancing measures impacted mobility by an-
alyzing the change of the metrics detailed in Section 2.3. We
capture the mobility metrics of users for 10 weeks (from
week 10 to week 19 of 2020), which includes time before the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was declared in the UK on March
11th 2020 (week 11), as well as during the government im-
posed measures to tackle the emergency. The total number
of end-users whose data we aggregate for this study is ap-
proximately 16 million, and, unless otherwise specified, for
all metrics we report for every day the percentage of change
in the average daily value compared to average weekly value
in week 9 (23 February - 1 March 2020).
3.1 National Mobility
We start our analysis by investigating the nation-wide time
series for radius of gyration and the mobility entropy in Fig 3.
The average gyration evolution (Figure 3a) shows the re-
duction in the total area that users cover in their daily rou-
tines in reference to the average value over week 92. We
note that people started implementing social distancing rec-
ommendations even before lockdown was enforced, with a
decrease of 20% in gyration in week 12. With the govern-
ment imposing the nation-wide lockdown in week 13, we
also observe a steep decrease in gyration, with a drop of 50%
towards the end of week 13 compared to the usual value
from week 9. Mobility entropy per user follows a similar
trend (Figure 3b). All metrics show a steep decrease in weeks
13-14, following the "stay-at-home" being enforced. In the
following weeks, we note a slight relaxation, with mobility
marginally increasing. It is worth noticing that, the reduction
of entropy is smaller than the reduction of gyration. This
2Note that during the weekdays of week 9, the gyration is larger while
during the weekend is smaller, yielding the aforementioned average.

indicates that people, besides moving significantly less, tend
to move close to their home location.
Figure 4 captures the correlation between the average
mobility entropy per user and the nation-wide cumulative
number of lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, as reported
by Public Health England[18]. Each point in the scatterplot
represent a different day; we capture the interval between
February 23rd until May 4th, 2020. We note that the mo-
bility reduction is not impacted by the number of reported
cases, i.e., there is not a correlation between number of cases
5
and mobility, but rather mobility is impacted by public an-
nouncement and lockdown measures. The decrease in the
entropy starts only after the pandemic is declared (vertical
red line in Figure 4, coinciding with 1,000 confirmed cases),
and becomes significant after the lockdown.
Takeaway: Mobility metrics (gyration and entropy) show
a steep decrease in people’s mobility in weeks 13-14, fol-
lowing the "stay-at-home" order being enforced. We find
no correlation between this reduction in mobility and the
number of confimed COVID-19 cases, showing that only
the enforced government order was effective in significantly
reducing mobility. We also notice mobility slightly increases
from week 15 despite the lockdown still being enforced.
3.2 Regional Mobility
We now focus our analysis on five different regions in order
to observe potential geo-spatial difference in the mobility
pattern changes. We select the regions that are best repre-
sented in our dataset with more than 500,000 users, namely
Inner London (700k users), Outer London (1,1 million users),
Greater Manchester (700k users), West Midland (600k users)
and West Yorkshire (500k users). For each region, we capture
the variation of the two mobility metrics (Figure 5) in ref-
erence to the nation-wide average value of the metric. The
evolution of the metrics shows clearly the impact of the stay-
at-home measures in every region, with a sharp decrease in
weeks 13-14 in the values of all metrics. We note that for
London (both Inner and Outer London), reference values for
gyration are below national average (20% below the aver-
age for each corresponding week– see Figure 5a), while the
