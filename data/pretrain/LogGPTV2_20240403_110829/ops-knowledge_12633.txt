I have been coding websites in PHP for the past year, but I am now considering other options. Google App Engine (GAE) seems like a promising choice. I am particularly interested in using GAE to create a small website for sharing favorite YouTube videos.

A few months ago, I developed a website using Python and Django, and I found it to be quite effective. However, I also want to learn Java, as I haven't coded in it since my school days. Choosing between these options is challenging, so I would appreciate some opinions.

Specifically, I would like to know if there are any known issues or glitches when using either Python or Java on GAE. Additionally, I am curious whether GAE is generally recommended for such projects. This website will not just be for learning purposes; it will be for a client.

Thank you for your insights!
