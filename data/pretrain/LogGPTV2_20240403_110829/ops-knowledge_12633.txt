User: Basically I am coding websites in PHP from last year.
But now I want to use something else and GAE looks a good option.
So I want to know if GAE is good for making a little website to share favorite youtube videos ?
I have done single website in Python+Django few months back, it looks good to me.
But JAVA is the language that I want to learn too (never coded in JAVA since School days ).
Phew, it is hard to choose, so I need opinions !!
Specifically : Want to know if any glitch/problem in using either python or Java under GAE. Or if GAE is preferred or not. Not gonna make website for learning only, it will be for a client.
Assistant: You need an IRL mentor.
