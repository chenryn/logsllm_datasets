User: I'm reinstalling Python, on Windows 7, and one of the first dialog boxes is the Customize Python screen.
The default setting for "Add Python.exe to Path" is "Entire feature will be unavailable."
I always change this to "Will be installed on local hard drive."
It's not an issue, changing the system environment variables is a snap, but is there any upside to leaving this un-ticked?
Assistant: One upside I can think of is if you run multiple python versions in windows.  So, you have c:\python34 and c:\python27 but both are in the path, you'll get whichever comes first, leading you to a possibly unexpected result.
