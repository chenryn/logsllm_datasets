User: Currently Fabric's 'rsync_projecct' requires a user and a host parameter to be specified.  I'having a lot of issues copying   user@127.0.0.1 because it is still asking me for the password for rsync.  I've spent hours on this and am wondering if there is just a way to use the rsync [src] [dest] without having to specify a [user] and [host]?  Or do you guys recommend something better?  
The reason I like rsync over anything else is because I already have the rsync files/folders/excludes setup for that specific command.
Then again, I could just write my own rsync command right?
Thanks.
Assistant: you can just local() out and use rsync any way you want to.
