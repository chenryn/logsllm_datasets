User: I wanted to install WSGI on a RedHat linux box in order to make a Python server interface, but the only way I could find to do that was to use modwsgi, which is an Apache module. The whole reason I'm using WSGI is that I don't want to use Apache, so this kinda defeats the purpose. 
Does anyone know of actual WSGI packages for RedHat linux or is this the only way? 
----Edit----
I just found out that WSGI is built into Python 2.5 and higher, so I don't need to install anything. I don't know how to mark this question as solved without answering it myself. Any tips will be appreciated.
Assistant: I found out that WSGI is included in Python 2.5 and above, so you don't need to do any installs. Just say things like from wsgiref import make_server.
