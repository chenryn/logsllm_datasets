An arrow function as part of an extends clause requires parenthesis. This was
changed before ES2015 became final, see
http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony%3Aspecification_drafts#january_20_2014_draft_rev_22
@gabelevi summarized the issue internally at FB:
  1. After "extends" there is a LeftHandSideExpression: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-class-definitions
  2. LeftHandSideExpression is a CallExpression or a NewExpression: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-left-hand-side-expressions
  3. ArrowFunction is an AssignmentExpression: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-assignment-operators
