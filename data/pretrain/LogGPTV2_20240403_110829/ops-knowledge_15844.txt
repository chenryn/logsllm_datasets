User: if i want to script a mini-application (in the Terminal) in mac and windows, which one is preferred: ruby or python?
or is there no major difference just a matter of taste?
cause i know python definetely is a good scripting language.
thanks
Assistant: Matter of taste, really. They each have a pretty good set of libraries and are cross-platform, so it'll be a matter of which one you prefer to code in.
