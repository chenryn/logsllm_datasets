ABSTRACT  
This paper studies the feasibility of an early warning system that 
prevents  users  from  the  dangerous  situations  they  may  fall  into 
during  web  surfing.  Our  approach  adopts  behavioral  Hidden 
Markov  Models  to  explore  collective  intelligence  embedded  in 
users’ browsing behaviors for context-aware category prediction, 
and  applies  the  results  to  web  security  threat  prevention.  Large-
scale  experiments  show  that  our  proposed  method  performs 
accuracy 0.463 for predicting the fine-grained categories of users’ 
next  accesses.  In  real-life  filtering  simulations,  our  method  can 
achieve  macro-averaging  blocking  rate  0.4293  to  find  web 
security  threats  that  cannot  be  detected  by  the  existing  security 
protection solutions at the early stage, while accomplishes a low 
macro-averaging  over-blocking  rate  0.0005  with  the  passage  of 
time.  In  addition,  behavioral  HMM  is  able  to  alert  users  for 
avoiding security threats by 8.4 hours earlier than the current URL 
filtering engine does. Our simulations show that the shortening of 
this  lag  time  is  critical  to  avoid  severe  diffusions  of  security 
threats.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Web security threats such as viruses, malwares, phishing, botnets, 
and  so  on  cause  serious  damages  during  web  surfing.  Different 
approaches  have  been  proposed  to  deal  with  different  kinds  of 
security threats. Phishing are significant security threats involving 
fraudulent  web  pages  that  masquerade  as  trustworthy  ones  for 
tricking users into revealing private and sensitive information. A 
comprehensive  feature-based  framework  was  proposed  to  detect 
phishing  web  sites  [1].  Prophiler  performed  fast  and  reliable 
analysis  for  filtering  malicious  web  pages  [2].  Botnets  are 
networks  of  malware-infected  machines  that  are  controlled  and 
commended  for  causing  specific  damages.  SBotMiner  captured 
the  group  of  coordinated  search  bots  using  query  logs  [3].

Discriminative  features  were  learned  from  suspicious  URLs  to 
distinguish  malicious  web  sites  [4].  A  static  analysis  was 
presented to discover execution-after-redirection vulnerabilities in 
web  applications  [5].  Web  Tap  was  designed  to  monitor  and 
record  a  number  of  browsing  statistics  to  identify  web  security 
threats such as backdoor programs, spyware, adware, and so forth 
[6].  EVILSEED  was  a  guided  approach  to  find  malicious  web 
pages that use drive-by-download attacks to install malwares for 
manipulating users’ computers [7]. 
In  this  study,  we  propose  an  early  warning  mechanism  by 
analyzing users’ browsing behaviors to alert protected-users with 
the  warning  messages  for  avoiding  security  threats.    This  will 
prevent users from falling into dangerous situations for providing 
more secured web surfing. 
2.  BEHAVIRAL HMM 
Users’  browsing  behaviors  on  the  Web  results  in  users’  click-
through trails, which are defined as access sequences during web 
surfing for reflecting users’ browsing intents. In this study, each 
clicked URL is rated into one of the 83 pre-defined categories in a 
proprietary  system  TMUFE  [8].  In  users’  online  surfing,  this 
filtering  engine  determines  the  categories  of  web  pages  by 
checking  their  URLs  through  a  database  with  millions  of 
categorized  URLs  for  efficiently  filtering  disallowed  users’ 
accesses.  Clicked  URLs,  especially  those  pointing  to  newborn 
pages,  are  rated  as  the  “Unknown”  category  if  they  are  not 
categorized in the database at the access time. In the backend, this 
proprietary  engine  adopts  a  batch  strategy  to  analyze  the 
corresponding content signatures for classifying these “Unknown” 
URLs  into  pre-defined  categories.  After  manually  checking  the 
candidate  categories  proposed  by  the  content-based  dynamic 
rating,  these  newly  categorized  URLs  are  used  to  expand  the 
original  database  via  scheduled  updates.  TMUFE  handles  huge 
number  of  URLs  clicked  by  worldwide  users’  accesses  daily.  
How to cost-effectively determine the categories of clicked URLs 
as  quickly  as  possible  is  an  important  task.  The  time  interval  of 
category  transition  from  “Unknown”  to  a  definite  category  is 
critical, if the accessed URLs contain web security treats. On the 
one  hand,  longer  intervals  will  delay  the  prevention  of  possible 
threats and cause more damages, and on the other hand shortening 
the  time  interval  needs  more  computational  cost  for  online 
processing and human cost for manual checking. 
The problem statement is described as follows. Let u1u2…u(n-1)un 
be a user’s access sequence during web surfing, where ui is the ith 
clicked URL in the click-through trail, and this sequence is rated 
992as a category sequence c1c2…c(n-1)cn. Assume c1, c2, ..., c(n-1) belong 
to definite categories, i.e., a set of pre-defined categories  C={c1, 
c2, …, c|C|}, and cn is the “Unknown” category at the access time.  
The  main  research  question  is  how  to  quickly  determine  the 
category of the “Unknown” click-through at user’s access time for 
keeping  up  with  the  rapidly  changing  web.  That  is,  given  the 
context  c1c2...c(n-1),  we  focus  on  exploring  collective  intelligence 
embedded in users’ browsing behaviors to assign one of definite 
categories to the clicked URL un at the early stage. Some definite 
categories such as “Virus/Worm”, “Spyware”, “Phishing”, etc. are 
used to label web security threats. If the “Unknown” category of a 
user’s  next  access  is  predicted  as  one  of  these  categories,  we 
regard  it  as  a  dangerous  access  for  potentially  blocking  the 
suspected web security threats.  
A  user’s  click-through  trail  represented  as  a  sequence  of 
categories  denotes  an  access  context  of  a  specific  user.  We 
employ the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture contextual 
information by learning users’ browsing behaviors for predicting 
the category of a user’s next access. In training an m-gram HMM, 
each  continuous  (m-1)  categories  in  a  category  sequence  is 
regarded  as  a  state.  In  this  way,  (n-m+2)  states  c1c2…c(m-1), 
c2c3…cm,  …,  and    c(n-m+2)c(n-m+3)…cn  are  generated  from  an  n-
category sequence c1c2…cn. Consequently, there are (n-m+1) state 
transitions 
transition  from  state 
cic(i+1)...c(m+i-2) to  state  c(i+1)c(i+2)...c(m+i-1),  symbol  c(m+i-1)  is  emitted.  
All the category sequences in the training set are used to learn the 
m-gram HMM model, which is denoted as HMMm. In the testing 
phase, the trained m-gram HMM model calculates the probability 
of each definite category assigning to cn in a testing trail given a 
context consisting of a sequence of observations c1c2…c(n-1). The 
category  with  the  largest  probability  will  be  proposed  as  the 
predicted result shown in Equation (1).

3.  EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION 
3.1  Click-through Data 
The  data  sets  come  from  click-through  data  in  Trend  Micro 
research  laboratory.  It  consists  of  web  browsing  behaviors  from 
11,548,990 anonymous worldwide users during November 2010. 
User  click-through  trails  consisting  of  at  least  4  accesses  are 
included and divided into two distinct data sets for evaluation. (1) 
Training  set:  All  the  trails  in  the  training  set  are  composed  of 
definite categories. That is, all the clicked URLs in the trails are 
rated into one of the 83 definite categories using the proprietary 
system TMUFE. Total 48,577,356 trails from 1st-15th Nov. were 
selected  for  training.  (2)  Test  set:  Each  trail  in  the  test  set  is 
denoted as a sequence of categories c1, c2, …, cn, where c1, c2, …, 
c(n-1)  belong  to  the  definite  categories,  and  cn  is  an  “Unknown” 
category at the rating time ti, but becomes a definite category at 
some later time tj (ti<tj) by off-line processing. We use the rating 
category at time tj as the ground truth for performance evaluation.  
In total, 85,781 trails from 16th-30th Nov. were used for testing. 
3.2  Experimental Results 
In  the  first  set  of  experiments,  four  category  prediction  models 
based  on  click-through  data  are  compared  to  demonstrate  their 
performance  in  Table  1.  The  Naïve  Bayes  model  regards  the 
previous accesses as “bag-of-categories”, i.e., the order of users’ 
accesses is not considered. Different from the Naïve Bayes model, 
the  behavioral  HMM  model  formulates  the  order  of  the  users’ 
previous  accesses  for  context-aware  category  prediction.  The 
accuracy  difference  between  any  two  models  is  statistically 
significant  (p  <  0.001)  on  the  test  set.  Experimental  results
