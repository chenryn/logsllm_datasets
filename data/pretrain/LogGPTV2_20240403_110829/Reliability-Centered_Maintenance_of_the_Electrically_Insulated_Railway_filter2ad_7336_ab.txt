only failure or normal operation, with speciﬁc distributions
of failure times such as exponential or Weibull distributions.
An extended BE can be equipped with multiple phases, rep-
resenting different stages of degradation. The transition into a
next phase is described by an exponential distribution. Since
the BE progresses linearly through the stages, the total failure
behaviour of a BE in a FMT is described by an Erlang
distribution.
RDEP gates. FMTs contain all the gates of static and dynamic
FTs. Additionally, they contain a rate dependency (RDEP)
gate, representing dependencies between components leading
to accelerated wear. This gate has one trigger input, and one
or more dependent children. When the trigger input fails, the
failure behaviours of the dependent children are all accelerated
by a factor γ, which can be different for each child. When the
trigger input is repaired, degradation of the dependent children
returns to their normal rate.
Repair and inspection modules. Standard FTs can support
relatively simple repairs using distributions over repair times,
or via repair boxes [7]. FMTs model more advanced main-
tenance policies via inspection and repair modules (IMs and
RMs).
The IM describes at what frequency components are in-
spected as well as so called repair threshold. The latter is the
(minimal) degradation phase where repairs will be performed.
At degradation phases lower than the threshold, no repair will
take place, either because the degradation is not visible, or
because it is not considered necessary. When the threshold is
passed, and the next inspection will trigger a repair. Thus, the
IM will send out a repair request to the appropriate RM.
The RM listens for repair requests for the components
under its control and initiates their repair or replacement. After
the RM is invoked, the BE changes its phase to a less degraded

Fig. 4. PTA for a repair module. The PTA begins in the leftmost state with
clock x initially zero. It waits until either the waiting time for a periodic
repair (Tperiod) elapses, or a repair request signal (force[id]) is received. In
either case, the module waits some time Trepair, incurs the C for a repair,
sends a signal (repair[id]) so any BEs repaired by this module, and resets the
timer.
phase. Moreover, the RM can invoke a periodic renewal of
components, e.g. the replacement of a tire after four years.
C. Analysis of FMT by statistical model checking of priced
timed automata
Technically, FMTs are realized via statistical model check-
ing of price timed automata. That is, we ﬁrst convert the
FMTs into a network of priced timed automata (PTAs) [14]
and use the statistical model checker Uppaal [15] to compute
the relevant dependability metrics. Each element of the FMT
(that
is, each gate, BE, IM and RM) is translated into a
price timed automaton. Then, all PTAs are composed together
and analysed by Uppaal. We use the statistical engine here
which is, unlike the veriﬁcation engine, based on Monte Carlo
simulation techniques.
PTAs are an extension of timed automata with costs on
locations and actions. PTAs are transition systems that use real-
valued clocks to specify deadlines and enabling conditions for
actions. Costs can be incurred either with ﬁxed amount when
taking a transition, or by spending time in location, with a
rate that is proportional to amount of time spent in the certain
location.
The PTA for the repair module, inspection module and
basic event are shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
During the translation, each FMT element (i.e. BE, gate,
IM, and RM) is assigned a unique ID. The structure of the
tree is then represented by the ids of the various signals used
by the components to communicate. For example, if an IM
with ID ‘1‘ is inspecting a BE, the PTA for this BE will emit
a signal thres[1], to which the IM will react. The gates, not
shown in this paper, listen for signals fail[child id] from their
children, and emit their own signal fail[id] when appropriate
for their gate type.
D. Metrics
We analyze several aspects of the dependability of the EI-
joint, which can be used to compare different maintenance
policies and help in deciding which policy is better. We
consider the reliability, expected number of failures, and costs.
Reliability. The probability of experiencing no system failures
within a given time period. We compute the probability that
within a certain period, these is never a time where a set of
BEs is in a failed state leading to the occurrence of the top
level event of the FMT.
Expected number of failures. We compute the expected
number of occurrences of the top event in a given time window.

and waits until either the time until the inspection interval (Tperiod) elapses, or
until a threshold signal (thres[id]) is received from a BE. If the time elapses
before a signal is received, then the inspection cost is incurred and the timer
resets. If a threshold signal is received, the module waits for the scheduled
inspection time, then signals its associated repair module to begin a repair
(force[rep id]), and then resets the timer.

Fig. 6. PTA of a basic event with failure time given by an Erlang distribution
with n phases phases and an inspection threshold at thres phase. From the
initial state,
the PTA waits an exponentially distributed time with mean
lambda, and moves downward if it has not yet reached the last phase in
the Erlang distribution, or rightward if it has. If it is not in the ﬁnal phase,
is advances by one phase, and it may emit a signal thres[id] to a listening
inspection module. The BE may also receive a signal repair[id] and return
the the initial phase. Upon completing the ﬁnal phase, the failure counter is
incremented and a signal fail[id] is emitted. A threshold signal may be sent,
and then the BE waits to receive a repair[id] signal. After receiving this signal,
the failed BE emits a signal repaired[id], and returns to the initial phase and
state.
Since all failures of the EI-joint can be repaired, there can be
multiple failures over time. We can also compute the number
of failures of individual components or subtrees of the FMT.
Cost. We can measure several costs incurred by the system
over time. Speciﬁcally, we consider the costs of maintenance
and failures. We can further separate costs into the costs of
inspections, speciﬁc maintenance actions, and failures.
IV. MODELLING OF THE EI-JOINT
A. Fault tree modelling
The FMT has been constructed from a failure mode,
effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) [16] table that was
provided by ProRail. An FMECA lists failure information per
failure mode: its effect the consequences when this failure
occurs, and its criticality describing how bad this failure is.
In our case, the FMECAs are combined with, among others,
the current maintenance policy, as well as failure frequencies.
The resulting FMT is displayed in Figure 3. As described
in Section II-C, the joint failures are divided into physical and
electrical failures. The electrical failures are further divided
into failures caused by external inﬂuences such as iron shav-
ings short-circuiting the joint, and failures caused internally in
the joint such as degradation of the insulating material.
The FMT for the EI-joint uses only ORs and RDEPs as
gates. The method, however, works equally well with other
FT gate types. The OR-gates show how to combine events
into the top level event. The RDEPs are crucial to model
failure dependencies, where the occurrence of one failure
mode accelerates other failure modes. A few failure modes
in the EI-joint have a severe effect on other failure modes:
poor geometry affects almost all other physical failure modes;
production and installation failures affect the failure of the glue
connection, etc. Hence, a faithful model requires the expressive
means to represent such failure accelerations.
The parameters of the BEs are listed in Table I.
B. Maintenance modelling
We compare the dependability and costs of joint subject
to different maintenance policies. This allows us both to
validate the model against actual recorded failure, and to offer
suggestions for improvements in the policy that lead to cost
savings or increased dependability.
ProRail has offered a possible maintenance policy, which is
expected to reduce the number of failures to acceptable levels,
and is close to the maintenance performed in practice.
In the FMT, inspection modules describe the inspection
rates and the threshold at which corrective action is performed.
The threshold in the FMT is described in terms of the degra-
dation states of the BEs, while the reference policy describes
physical observations such as ‘maximal vertical deformation 5
mm’. The translation of these physical descriptions to degra-
dation phase was performed according to expert judgement.
Many BEs are maintained only by replacing the entire
joint, which was implemented as a repair action that resets
all BE degenerations to their initial state. The remaining
BEs are maintained by correcting the speciﬁc fault identiﬁed
during inspection, which is modelled by resetting only the
degeneration of the BE undergoing the repair.
The current model makes a few assumptions: First, we
assume that all inspections and repairs are carried out exactly
on schedule. Since the ﬂuctuations in inspection and repair
times are small compared to the inspection interval,
this
assumption is reasonable. Also we assume that that inspections
are perfect, i.e. an inspection always leads to a repair if the
degradation level is past the threshold. While this may seem
more questionable, we argue that the possibility of missing a
failure is partially accounted for in the degradation threshold.
C. Choosing parameters for the model
One of the key factors in the analysis it the choice of
the values for the parameters in our model. We have spent
signiﬁcant effort on the data collection process, via extensive
consulting with domain experts at different contractors, leading
to a model that provides enough conﬁdence.
Our BE models contain the following parameters: (1)
The number n of degradation phases, (2) The rate λ of the
exponential distribution between these degradation phases. (3)
The probability of the conditions that are necessary for failures
to occur. (4) The maintenance thresholds, i.e. the minimum
degradation level where maintenance is performed. (5) The
acceleration rates for the RDEP gates.
We have estimated the values for these parameters by
designing a questionnaire sent to several experts on mainte-

nance for EI-joints. The appendix lists the questions asked.
The responses from the maintenance experts mostly agreed.
Further, we have used information from the aforementioned
incident report system at ProRail.
Note that (1) and (2) together describe the time to failure
for a given BE as an Erlang(λ, k) distribution. The expectation
of this distribution equals λk, which should be equal to the
expected life span L of the component if no maintenance
is performed. The failure rates were directly asked in the
questionnaire. The number of degradation phases were derived
from the answer by the expert which failure curve shown in
Figure 7 applies to each failure mode.
Certain failure modes can only occur if a certain condition
exists. This condition is documented in the FMECA, and the
probability of the condition per joint was obtained by an
informal interview with an expert.
The acceleration rates are obtained from the FMECA, by
comparing the indicated number of failures due to an RDEP-
triggering failure to the total number of failures.
Having obtained these parameters, we have in some cases
and together with experts further tuned the model, so that for
each failure mode, the number of failures predicted by our
model for that BE corresponds to the actual number of failures
from the failure database.
Then,
to validate our models, we have computed the
number of maintenance actions required, and the total number
of failures in one year. These values agreed with historical
data recorded by ProRail, leading us to the conclusion that the
tuned parameters are accurate.
D. Costs
Our model contains three categories of costs: Failure costs,
inspection costs, and repair costs. To maintain conﬁdentiality,
the actual costs have been somewhat modiﬁed and no exact
ﬁgures are shown in this paper.
Inspection costs are set as a ﬁxed amount per inspection,
and repair costs are ﬁxed for each type of repair. The cost
for failures consist of the cost caused by the unavailability of
the railroad tracks. These are deﬁned as societal cost, i.e., a
synthetic costs that are used as a key performance indicator
to steer the performance of railroad companies. These societal
costs are also incurred when the tracks are unavailable due to
planned maintenance.
V. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
In this section we describe the results of several exper-
iments we conducted on the FMT of the EI-Joint. As a ﬁrst
step, we validated the FMT against observations from the ﬁeld.
Therefore, we used the model as constructed, i.e. we analysed
the EI-joint under the current policy. Since we concluded that
the model is in line with the real world, we continued with
