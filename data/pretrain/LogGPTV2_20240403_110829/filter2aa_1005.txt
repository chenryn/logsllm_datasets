## Setting the Scene

In recent years, there have been numerous incidents involving:
- **Account Takeovers**
- **Phishing Attacks**
- **Bypassing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

We aimed to research:
- **How these attacks were carried out**
- **The attack vectors involved**
- **The requirements for such attacks**
- **Reproducibility of the attacks**
- **Methods to help people protect against them**

## Smishing (SMS Phishing)

Text-based phishing attacks are on the rise. Key points include:
- **Most phishing protection mechanisms are designed for email, not SMS.**
- **Smishing attacks increased by over 7x in the first two quarters of 2021 compared to 2020.** [Source: EarthWeb]
- **Verifying the integrity or sender of SMS messages is challenging.**
- **Less than 35% of people recognize when they are being targeted by smishing attacks.**

### Why the Sudden Increase in Smishing?

- **Higher trust in SMS compared to emails**
- **Fewer SMS spam messages than email spam**
- **Higher success rates due to fewer countermeasures**

## Digital Dumpster Diving

### How We Found Phone Numbers and "Dump Files"

- **There is a dedicated online community for trading stolen/leaked data.**
- **These communities exist both on clear-net sites and the darknet.**
- **To gather this data, we went where the bad guys hang out.**

### Getting the Ducks in a Row

Once you have the dump files, it's all about making sense of the data. Here are some examples of popular leaked files and the number of telephone numbers they contained:

- **Facebook.com**: 123 million phone numbers, 180 million emails
- **Jd.com**: 96 million
- **Vk.com**: 78 million
- **...**

## All Your Numbers Are Belong to Us!

### Demo

**Credentials Example:**
- **USERNAME:PASSWORD/HASH**
- **USERNAME:PASSWORD:TELEPHONE**

### Telephone Rainbow Tables

- **We can tie one in 10 email addresses on the internet to a valid telephone number.**
- **We have indexed over 500 million phone numbers and email pairs.**
- **With password hashes, this is a great starting point for attacks.**

### Real-World Examples

- **Human Rights Watch Attack (2018)**
- **Crypto.com (2021)**
- **OpenSea (2022)**

### Popular 2FA Bypass via Smishing/Phishing

1. **Account Recovery and Password Resets to Change Phone Number**
2. **SMS Injection into Initiated Login with 2FA Enabled**
3. **Smishing/Phishing Proxies Against Real Sites (Saving Session Cookies)**
4. **SIM Jacking/SIM Cloning/Porting**

### Account Recovery

- **Account recovery options are often open.**
- **Helps in verifying other linked accounts and telephone numbers.**
- **Helpdesk remains a popular method to change telephone numbers for 2FA.**

### Crypto.com Attack

- **$34.6M lost from 436 accounts.**
- **2FA bypass via smishing password reset.**

### Coinbase Attack

- **Third parties needed prior knowledge of the email address, password, and phone number associated with the Coinbase account.**
- **They exploited a flaw in Coinbaseâ€™s SMS Account Recovery process to gain access.**

### OpenSea.com Attack

- **After our research, this incident occurred.**

## Let's Talk About SMS (Text Messages)

### History of SMS

- **SMS was developed in 1984 by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert.**
- **The first text message, "Merry Christmas," was sent on December 3rd, 1992, by Neil Papworth to Richard Jarvis at Vodafone.**

### SMS as a Security Token

- **SMS messages have no sender verification.**
- **The `from_number` field has no checks except for alphanumeric characters.**
- **Any 7-bit ASCII is valid, allowing anyone with SMSC access to send anything.**
- **Some US-based carriers started blocking this in late 2020.**

### Demo: Sending SMS Messages (Smishing)

- **Sending SMS through API services**
- **Sending SMS through a modem/old phone**

### Teaching Old Phones New Tricks

- **Taking smishing to the next level with Smishash attacks.**

### Phished User, Adversary in the Middle, Website Server

- **SSL/TLS connections between the user and the server.**

### Integrating This into Red Teaming

- **Start with OSINT collection.**
- **Index large dumps for comprehensive data.**
- **Use API providers and open-source scripts for smishing.**
- **Employ MITM proxies like Evilginx2.**

### Protection Against MITM 2FA Bypass

- **Recaptcha (Hidden)**
- **Cloudfront cookies (hidden)**
