### SCADA & PLCs in Correctional Facilities: The Nightmare Before Christmas

**Presenters:**
- John Strauchs
- Tiffany Rad
- Teague Newman

**Conference:**
- Defcon 19

**Overview:**
This presentation will analyze the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems and PLCs in correctional and government-secured facilities. We will discuss modern prison design, theorize possible attack vectors, and demonstrate a vulnerability on a Siemens PLC. Additionally, we will recommend solutions to mitigate these risks.

**Presentation Objectives:**
1. **Analyze Vulnerabilities:**
   - Examine SCADA systems and PLC vulnerabilities in secured facilities.
2. **Discuss Modern Prison Design:**
   - Provide an overview of current prison infrastructure and control systems.
3. **Theorize Attack Vectors:**
   - Identify potential routes for introducing malicious code.
4. **Demonstrate a Vulnerability:**
   - Explain ladder logic and demonstrate a vulnerability on a Siemens PLC.
5. **Recommend Solutions:**
   - Provide actionable recommendations to address identified vulnerabilities.

**Background:**
- **PLCs and SCADA Systems:**
  - Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) have been in use for over 40 years.
  - The Stuxnet worm, which targeted Siemens PLCs in Iran, brought significant attention to the vulnerabilities in these systems.
  - Research and discussions on Stuxnet were presented at Black Hat Abu Dhabi by Tom Parker and FX.

**Potential Impacts:**
- **Security Risks:**
  - A virus or worm similar to Stuxnet could target government or state locations, including correctional facilities.
  - This could lead to catastrophic failures, such as all doors opening simultaneously during a power surge.

**Prison and Jail Design:**
- **Prisons:**
  - Federal or state facilities with hundreds of cells and thousands of inmates.
  - Confinement typically ranges from one year to life.
- **Jails:**
  - County, city, or town facilities with fewer cells but can also house many inmates, especially regional jails.
  - Confinement is usually less than one year, but pre-trial confinement can include a wide range of offenses.

**Facility Statistics:**
- **United States:**
  - 117 federal correctional facilities
  - 1,700 prisons (penitentiaries)
  - 3,000 jails
  - Approximately 160 are operated by private companies
  - Most use PLCs in their electronic security systems

**Control Center and Infrastructure:**
- **Central Control:**
  - The "brain" of the system, responsible for monitoring and controlling various security functions.
  - Functions include door control, duress alarms, intercoms, CCTV, and perimeter fence sensors.
- **Rack-Mounted PLCs and Relay Banks:**
  - These components manage critical functions such as lighting, water, and public telephones.

**Conclusion:**
- **Support and Funding:**
  - Provide support for wardens and corrections administrators to secure funding for necessary fixes.
  - Emphasize the importance of following operating procedures to prevent security breaches.
- **Awareness:**
  - Raise awareness about the use of PLCs in correctional facilities and the potential risks associated with them.
