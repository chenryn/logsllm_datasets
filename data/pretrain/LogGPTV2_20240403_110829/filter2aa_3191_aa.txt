We briefed some Federal Agencies.  One was 
stealthy, probably difficult to see at night – or ever. 
Another has some handsome Agents, but also has 
the capability to extend its domestic claws. They are 
“friends” 
Story of Christmas Eve 
  Discovered that the correctional facility 
contractor had not followed specification 
  Used two hardware components not specified 
and had never been used together 
  The PLC and the relay were part of the specs.  
  The ratings were different 
  The circuit board on the Square D was supposed to 
be 0 volts out but more volts went into it with a power 
surge and the one-way diode was leaking voltage 
  When the controls work at 25 milivolts, a low power 
spike is all that needs to trigger it 
  Possibly with increased power consumption on 
Christmas Eve, all the doors opened when there was a 
power surge 
  Few people knew what a programmable 
logic controller (PLC) was before Stuxnet 
when Siemens PLCs in Iran were exploited  
& damaged nuclear processing centrifuges 
›  PLCs have been around for more than 40 years.

What if someone wrote a virus or worm, 
similar to Stuxnet, but targeted 
government or state locations like 
correctional facilities?

  The attack was directed against STEP 7, 
the Siemens software that is used to 
reprogram PLCs. 
  Supposedly, Microsoft patches 
MS08-067, MS10-046 and MS10-061 for 
Windows fixed the vulnerabilities that 
allowed the compromise 
  The cyber-security and hacking 
communities have been focusing on 
SCADA systems in the use of PLCs in the 
national infrastructure: 
›  Power grid 
›  Pipelines 
›  Water systems 
›  And so forth 
  But…because most people don’t know 
how prisons and jails are designed and 
constructed, most people didn’t realize 
that they are controlled by PLCs. 
  Prison : A federal or state facility 
›  Many have hundreds of cells and thousands 
of inmates 
›  Confinement is typically a year to life 
  Jail : A county, city or town facility 
›  Most have a few cells but some have many 
hundreds of cells, especially regional jails 
  Orange County Jail, California, has 2540 
inmates 
›  Usually confinement is less than one year 
  But, pre-trial confinement could be for a 
pickpocket or a terrorist or serial killer 
  In the United States: 
›  117 federal correctional facilities 
›  1,700 prisons (penitentiaries) 
›  3,000 jails 
›  About 160 are operated by private 
companies 
  And most use PLCs in their electronic 
security systems
