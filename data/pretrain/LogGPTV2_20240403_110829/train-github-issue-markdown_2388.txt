**Migrated issue, originally created by mrudula chougule**
Hi,
I am having python+gtk application. I'm currently porting my python
application from Ubuntu 10.04 to 14.04. I have sqlalchemy version of
0.8.4-1Ubuntu2.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.  
When trying to run my application, when it is trying to insert column into
database it is throwing this error:  
**sqlalchemy.exc.compileError: Unconsumed column Name**
Please share your views or ideas to resolve this error.  
I'm stuck!!
Thanks,  
Mrudula
