**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Mrudula Chougule**

Hello,

I am currently working on a Python + GTK application and am in the process of porting it from Ubuntu 10.04 to 14.04. On my new system (Ubuntu 14.04), I have SQLAlchemy version 0.8.4-1Ubuntu2.1 installed.

When attempting to run my application, I encounter an error during the database insertion process. The specific error message is:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.CompileError: Unconsumed column name
```

Could you please provide any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this issue? I am currently at a standstill with this problem.

Thank you,
Mrudula
