Assistant: The steps to configure the FTP server and enable the FTP service in the Windows system are as follows: 1. Open the Control Panel, click "Programs", "Programs and Features" or "Programs and Features", and then select "Turn Windows features on or off". 2. In the "Windows Features" window, find "Internet Information Services" and expand it. 3. Make sure the following options are selected: FTP Server, FTP Extensibility, IIS Manage FTP Sites, and IIS Manage FTP Users. 4. Click OK to complete the installation. 5. Open the Internet Information Services Manager, right-click Sites, and choose Add FTP Site. 6. In the Add FTP Site Wizard, enter a site name and select a location for the site. 7. Then, select "IP Address and Domain Restrictions" to determine which IP addresses will have access to the FTP server. 8. Select "Authentication and Authorization" and set up a user account that has access to the FTP site. 9. Finally, click "Finish" to complete the FTP setup. Note: 1. Open the firewall and allow the FTP server to access the Internet through the corresponding port, otherwise external users cannot access the FTP server. 2. Make sure that the permissions of folders and files on the FTP server are set correctly. In general, FTP users should not have system-level privileges. 3. Make sure the FTP server encourages the use of encryption to protect the privacy and security of FTP communications. It is recommended to use the SFTP or FTP over TLS encryption protocol instead of the unencrypted FTP protocol.
