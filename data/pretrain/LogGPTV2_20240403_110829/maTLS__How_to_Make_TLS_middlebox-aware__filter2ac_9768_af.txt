### Middlebox Authentication and Security in TLS

**Middlebox Authentication via Certificates:**
Middleboxes are authenticated using their certificates. However, when mcTLS (Multi-context Transport Layer Security) employs a single session key, the security of the session is compromised if any of the involved middleboxes has write access. This is because, after a writer middlebox modifies the data, the receiver cannot determine the origin of the data.

**Transport Layer Middlebox Security Protocol (TLMSP):**
TLMSP is an enhanced version of mcTLS, currently being standardized by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute). TLMSP builds on mcTLS by optionally introducing an audit trail. This trail records each middleboxâ€™s inbound and outbound HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to verify modifications and the order of middleboxes in the chain. However, TLMSP uses a top-down approach, which is not suitable for incremental deployment, as discussed in Section V-B.

**Middlebox TLS (mbTLS):**
mbTLS allows outsourced middleboxes to participate in a TLS session. It extends TLS for middleboxes running on Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) technology. During the TLS handshake between endpoints, each endpoint establishes a secondary TLS session with all the middleboxes it leverages for remote attestation. After the primary TLS handshake, the endpoints send the session key to each middlebox. mbTLS, however, does not provide information about the secrecy or changes to TLS traffic. Instead, it relies on Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology to ensure middlebox integrity.

**Cryptographic Approaches: BlindBox and Embark:**
BlindBox [41] and Embark [20] enable a monitoring gateway (in the client's network) to read TLS traffic without revealing its content to middleboxes on a third-party cloud. They achieve this by introducing a secondary channel using special encryption techniques such as searchable or order-preserving encryption. The client communicates with the server over a TLS session and delivers packets to the middleboxes via the secondary channel before sending them to the server. These methods prevent private data from being leaked to the middleboxes but have two main drawbacks: the functionality of middleboxes is limited by the encryption techniques, and they require an additional round trip to the middleboxes over the secondary channel before sending the data to the other endpoint.

**TEE Approaches: SafeBricks, ShieldBox, and SGX-Box:**
SafeBricks [35], ShieldBox [43], and SGX-Box [16] focus on ensuring security and protecting privacy by building middleboxes over TEE technology. Each scheme has distinct properties:
- **SafeBricks** aims to apply the least privilege principle to middleboxes using a type-safe language.
- **ShieldBox** supports syscalls within an enclave.
- **SGX-Box** offers programmability to middlebox developers for easy deployment.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we propose middlebox-aware TLS, dubbed maTLS, which allows middleboxes to participate in TLS networking in a visible and accountable manner. The maTLS protocol aims to achieve the following security goals: server authentication, middlebox authentication, path secrecy, data source authentication, and modification accountability. To accomplish these goals, maTLS utilizes multiple mechanisms, including middlebox certificates, middlebox transparency, security parameter blocks, and modification records. We analyze the security properties of maTLS using Tamarin, which formally verifies that maTLS meets these goals. Testbed-based experiments demonstrate that maTLS achieves these goals with minimal performance overhead. For example, the additional delays compared to SplitTLS and mcTLS protocols are less than 33ms, primarily due to signaling overhead during the handshake. Numerical results also show that the maTLS protocol is scalable in terms of the number of middleboxes.
