I have discovered an issue with the `use-content-size` option in conjunction with the `x` and `y` properties when setting up a `BrowserWindow`. 

When I configure the `BrowserWindow` as follows:

```javascript
var mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    title: "Fireball-x",
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    'use-content-size': true,
    // x: 10,
    // y: 10,
});
```

The page content size is correctly set to 600 pixels in height, and the window size is slightly larger, as expected. However, when I include the `x` and `y` properties in the options, the `use-content-size` setting no longer functions as intended.

This behavior appears to be a bug in atom-shell. I have tested this on version 0.22.2 of atom-shell on macOS. I have not yet tested this on Windows.
