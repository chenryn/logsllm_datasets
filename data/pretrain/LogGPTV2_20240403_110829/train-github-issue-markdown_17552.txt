I just found window's size will be wrong when setup `use-content-size` with
`x` and `y` together.
When I write:
        var mainWindow = new BrowserWindow( {
            title: "Fireball-x",
            width: 800,
            height: 600,
            'use-content-size': true,
            // x: 10,
            // y: 10,
        } );
Things are correct, the page-content size will be 600 height and window size
will be a little larger than it. But once I put x, y in the options above,
`use-content-size` will loose its effect.
I guess this is a bug in atom-shell. I test this in v0.22.2, in Mac OSX. I
haven't test this in Windows yet.
