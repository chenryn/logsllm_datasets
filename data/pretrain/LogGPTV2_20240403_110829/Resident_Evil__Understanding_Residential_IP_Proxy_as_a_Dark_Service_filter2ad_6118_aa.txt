## Abstract
Residential IP proxy (RESIP) services have emerged as a new Internet business, where providers utilize hosts within residential networks to relay their customers' traffic, aiming to avoid server-side blocking and detection. Despite their potential involvement in cybercrimes, little is known about the operations and behaviors of these services due to the challenges in identifying RESIPs.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on RESIPs, providing insights into their behaviors and ecosystem. We developed an infiltration framework that includes our clients for RESIP services and the servers they visited, enabling us to detect 6 million RESIP IPs across more than 230 countries and 52,000 ISPs. We analyzed the observed addresses and fingerprinted the hosts using a new profiling system. Our findings reveal that many RESIPs run on likely compromised hosts, including IoT devices, despite providers' claims of willing participation. By cross-matching our data with PUP logs from a leading IT company, we uncovered various illicit activities, such as illegal promotion, fast fluxing, phishing, and malware hosting. Additionally, we reverse-engineered the internal infrastructures of RESIP services, uncovering potential rebranding and reselling behaviors. This research is a significant step towards understanding and mitigating the security risks associated with RESIP services.

## 1. Introduction
In October 2016, a series of massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks temporarily brought down the Domain Name System (DNS) operated by Dyn, a leading DNS provider, affecting major Internet platforms and services across Europe and North America. Notably, the attack traffic originated from 65,000 infected residential hosts, including home routers, web cameras, and digital video recorders. These residential IP addresses made the attack requests less distinguishable from legitimate ones, complicating detection and blocking efforts.

### Residential IP Proxy as a Service
Recent years have seen increasing demand for residential IPs, which are dynamically assigned by ISPs, as intermediaries to bypass restrictions imposed by target services. This has led to the emergence of Residential IP Proxy as a Service (RPaaS), offered by companies like Luminati, StormProxies, and Microleaves. These providers claim to use residential hosts that join their services willingly to proxy their customers' communication with any Internet target. However, when abused, these proxies can outperform conventional public proxies or anonymity networks, helping clients masquerade as benign sources. Such communication often violates service terms and may be associated with more malicious activities, such as DDoS attacks.

Despite their significance in illicit activities, RESIP services remain poorly understood. Key questions include whether these services genuinely use residential hosts, how they recruit these hosts, and whether they are involved in malicious activities. Understanding their infrastructure and ecosystem is crucial for determining their role in cybercrimes and for developing effective mitigation strategies.

### Our Study
Understanding RESIP services is challenging. Unlike open proxies, RESIP IPs are not publicly available and can only be accessed through a RESIP provider. Even if a proxy's IP is known, existing techniques cannot determine whether it is residential or whether the host is a willing participant or a compromised bot. Further, determining the malicious nature of these proxies and understanding their illicit activities is difficult due to the dynamic nature of the IPs and the shared hosts.

To address these challenges, we developed a suite of innovative techniques for a large-scale study. We purchased services from commercial RESIP providers, ran clients to communicate with our web servers, and marked the traffic with unique sub-domains and parameters to identify RESIP IPs. We then analyzed these IPs to extract unique Whois and DNS features, and used a high-performance host profiling system to fingerprint the hosts. We also correlated our client traffic with PUP logs from a major security company to uncover illicit operations and hidden infrastructural components.

### Findings
Using our framework, we analyzed five leading RESIP providers, including Luminati, Proxies Online, Geosurf, IAPS Security, and ProxyRack, and found 6.18 million unique IPs over a four-month period. Our key findings include:

- **Global Distribution**: The discovered RESIPs are distributed across 238 countries and regions, 28,035 /16 network prefixes, and 52,905 ISPs. Most (95.22%) are believed to be residential, with only 2.20% reported by public blacklists.
- **Compromised Hosts**: We identified 237,029 IoT devices and 4,141 RESIP hosts running potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). Despite providers' claims, none of the five RESIP providers is a completely consent-based anonymity system.
- **Malicious Programs**: Among the 67 different programs running as RESIPs, 50 are reported as malicious by antivirus tools.
- **Traffic Patterns**: The traffic patterns of RESIPs, even those running PUPs, differ significantly from previously reported bots, indicating new detection challenges.
- **Illicit Activities**: The traffic relayed by RESIPs involves ad clicking, promotion, and malicious activities. 9.36% of traffic destinations were detected as malicious. Other monetizing services, such as fast fluxing and malicious content, were also observed.
- **Reselling and Sharing**: Some RESIP providers appear to resell or share RESIP pools with other providers. For example, IAPS proxies were found to be relayed by Hola clients controlled by Luminati.
- **Hidden Gateways**: We identified hidden backend gateways in the RESIP service infrastructure, which decouple clients and RESIPs, making illicit activities stealthier.

### Contributions
- **New Findings**: Our study reveals the infrastructure, scale, malice, and stealthiness of RESIP services, highlighting the security implications and the need for regulation.
- **New Methodologies**: We designed novel techniques for finding RESIPs, profiling their behaviors, and analyzing the providers. These can be integrated into a holistic system for monitoring and preventing malicious activities.

## 2. Background
### Residential Proxy
Residential IP proxy services are a thriving business today. During our 2017 study, we observed the emergence of new RESIP services and a boom in existing businesses. For example, Proxies Online, the first RESIP service we found, increased their price from $3/GB to $25/GB in six months. Like traditional proxy services, RESIPs are promoted as anonymity channels but are characterized by their resilience against server-side detection and blocking. Residential IPs are often more trusted by servers than those from data centers and tend to be dynamic, making them nimble and capable of quickly migrating to other IPs when detected.

### RESIP Service Model
Figure 1 illustrates the RESIP service model, involving three parties: the main service component (proxy gateway and residential hosts), the client, and the server to be visited (the target). Once a client signs up with a RESIP service, they receive a gateway’s IP address or URL for accessing the service. The gateway forwards the client’s requests to different residential hosts, which send them to the target and get responses back. The inside view, however, can be more complex, as discussed later.

### IP Whois Database
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates IP addresses in large chunks to one of five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), including ARIN, APNIC, AFRINIC, LACNIC, and RIPE. Each RIR operates a Whois directory service to manage the registration of IP addresses in their regions. A Whois directory is organized in an object-oriented way, containing four types of objects: inetnum, person, organization, and ASN. An inetnum object describes an IP address range and its attributes, while organization and person objects represent the ownership of IP blocks. All inetnums are created hierarchically, forming an inetnum tree. Given an IP, its direct inetnum is the smallest inetnum that contains it.
