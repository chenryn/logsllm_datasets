User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题IPTables/Masquerade, making Linux kernel to see duplicate packets Will this rules make kernel to see the same packet at least twice?

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE                                                                   
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE                                                                    


Found the stuff in a forgotten config file. A remark about option "-d 0/0" was also there, did this option makes sense when certain log targets are used in iptables - to avoid incorrect traffic calculation?

Assistant: No, packets will not be seen twice. Only one of those two iptables rules will ever match a given packet, since a packet cannot exit the system by two different network interfaces at the same time. The routing algorithm always selects (at most) one output interface.
