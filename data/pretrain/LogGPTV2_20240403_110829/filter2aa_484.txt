The Internet
• A network of networks, glued by BGP
http://www.caida.org/research/topology/as_core_network/2014/
12
10/08/2014
One routing-table, many routing-tables
• BGP is worldwide, each AS routing table 
is a (partial) local view
• What you see depends on where you are

13

Connectivity troubleshooting
• NOC tools for troubleshooting:
– Distributed BGP probes, eg. 
RIPE Labs
– Private shells exchange, eg. NLNOG
– Limited web-access to routers, ie. via 
looking-glasses
14

What's in a looking glass
• A simple '90s style web-script:
– Usually PHP or Perl
– Single file, can be dropped in webroot
– Direct connection to SSH/telnet 
router console
– Cleartext config file (ie. credentials)

How does it look like
17
10/08/2014
Where to get it
• Focus on open-source most common 
ones:
– Cougar LG (Perl)
– Cistron LG (Perl)
– MRLG (Perl)
– MRLG4PHP (PHP)

19
10/08/2014
Targeting humans
• Assume bug-proof software
• Humans can still mis-deploy it, and forget to:
– Enable CGI/mod_php/mod_perl
– Protect config files
– Protect private SSH keys
Exposed routers credentials
20
10/08/2014
Targeting the web-app
• Assume some minor bugs may exist in the 
web frontend
• Pwn the LG web interface:
– Improper escaping
– XSS/CSRF/etc.
Cookie stealing for other web services
21
10/08/2014
Targeting the server
• Assume some medium severity bugs may 
exist in the whole package
• Pwn the host through LG:
– Embedded third-party tools
– Forked/modified modules
Escalate to the hosting server
22
10/08/2014
Targeting the router
• Assume important bugs may exist in the 
backend
• Pwn the router through LG:
– Missing input escaping
– Command injection to router 
– Known bugs in router CLI
Escalate to router administration
23
10/08/2014
Targeting the Internet
• Assume you control multiple routers in 
multiple ASes
• Pwn the Internet:
– Reroute/blackhole local traffic
– Announce bogus BGP prefixes
Chaos ensues :)

Web issues
• Exposed Credentials:
– Stored in cleartext: IPs, usernames 
and passwords
– Configuration files at known URLs
• Cookie Stealing:
– XSS vulnerabilities in LG, to target 
other web-apps
26
10/08/2014
Web Misconfigurations
• Google Dorks for login credentials:
– Find LG configuration files
– Examples:
● "login" "telnet" inurl:lg.conf
● "login" "pass" inurl:lg.cfg

Default config paths
● Example from Cougar LG root directory:
as.txt  CHANGELOG  communities.txt  COPYING  favicon.ico 
 lg.cgi  lg.conf  makeaslist.pl  makedb.pl  README
● So just crawl for it:
$BASE_LG_URL/lg.conf
30
10/08/2014
Best Practices :)
README sometime mentions them:
...still, we've found about 35 exposed cases!

Exposed Source Code
32
10/08/2014
Exposed Private SSH Keys
• Default path for SSH keys (CVE-2014-
3929) in Cougar LG
• Where are SSH private keys stored?
lg.conf:18 
→ /var/www/.ssh/private_key
33

Exposed Private SSH Keys

First steps into the web
• No CAPTCHA anywhere!
• This eases attacker's work:
– Automated resource mapping 
(ping-back and conf dumping)
– Automated command injection
– Automated attacks from multiple AS 
(if bugs are found)
35
10/08/2014
XSS
• XSS in  via "addr" parameter (CVE-
2014-3926) 
• LG maybe are not worthy web targets...
– But other NOC services often are under the 
same-origin domain!
36
10/08/2014
XSS – for the lulz!
37
10/08/2014
Router Command Injection
• What if you can run whatever CLI 
command you want  
‽
– CVE-2014-3927 in MRLG4PHP
• 'argument' parameter issue
– HTML escape != sanitization
• Let's look at the code (mrlg-lib.php:120)
38
10/08/2014
Router Command Injection
39
10/08/2014
Router Command Injection - PoC
• From HTTP to router CLI, 
just adding newlines :)
curl --data \
'routerid=10
&requestid=50
&argument=8.8.8.8%0Adate%0Aexit%OA'
40

Remote Memory Corruption
• Sometime LG ships with embedded third-
party binaries
– CVE-2014-3931 in MRLG
(fastping SUID bin)
• ICMP echo reply is used without proper 
validation
–
fastping.c:546 
Riempie_Ritardi( *((long *)&(icp->icmp_data[8])) , triptime );
• Let's have a look at the code

Remote Memory Corruption
42
10/08/2014
Exploitation notes
• 3rd-party, probably not commonly deployed
– WONTFIX by upstream
• Time-dependent...
– But you get host time in ICMP echo request!
• Every ICMP reply can overwrite one long word 
in memory...
– And you have 100 probes on every try

Talking about network design
● Routers admin consoles needlessly exposed 
over globally routable interfaces
44
10/08/2014
Outline
• Motivations
• Intro to looking glasses
• Threat model
• Vulns & incidents
• Countermeasures
45
10/08/2014
Code-wise
• Understand that exposing router 
consoles to the web with hardcoded 
credentials can be dangerous!
• Review all critical web-services written 
during the wild-west '90s
46
10/08/2014
Deployment-wise
• Prefer a dedicated read-only route-
server as LG endpoint
• Check if your private files are reachable 
over the web (LG config, SSH keys)
• Double check your web server config!
(vhost vs. default docroot)
47
10/08/2014
Administration-wise
• Setup proper ACL on your routers
• Use strong, unique passwords
• Put admin and out-of-band services in 
private VLANs and subnets!
48
10/08/2014
Recap
• Best-practices are often disregarded
• Unaudited, old, forgotten code often sits in 
critical places
• Attackers go for the weak links...
– and escalate quickly!
Internet core is fragile
