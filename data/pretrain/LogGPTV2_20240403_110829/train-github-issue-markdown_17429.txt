I just came across an error message that, in my opinion didn't really tell me
what the problem was.
I was setting up a simple *ngFor `*ngFor="#mode in modes"`
Yet, obviously I got an error because I put "in" instead of "of", however the
error was  
`Can't bind to 'ngForIn' since it isn't a known native property (template
info)`
It's clearly a stupid mistake, and now that I've seen it once, I understand
the error. However first looking at it, I was stumped. I don't personally have
suggestions as to what It should be, though perhaps the community does. (If
it's deemed worthy of a rewrite)
