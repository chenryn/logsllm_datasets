User:  How to use curl command to perform HTTP request and view response?
Assistant: Use the curl command to perform HTTP requests and view responses. Here is a simple example: 1. GET request ``` curl https://www.baidu.com/ ``` This command will send a GET request to Baidu website and print out the response text. 2. POST request ``` curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser", "password":"testpwd"}' https://api.example .com/login ``` This command will send a POST request to the API server, and the content of the POST request is the username and password in JSON format. The -H parameter specifies the request header, and the -d parameter specifies the request body. The above are two basic usage examples of the curl command, and the specific usage depends on the actual situation.
