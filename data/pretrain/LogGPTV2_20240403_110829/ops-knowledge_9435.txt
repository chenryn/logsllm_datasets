User: I'm on Windows 8, using Anaconda 1.7.5 64bit.
I created a new Anaconda environment with
conda create -p ./test python=2.7 pip
from C:\Pr\TEMP\venv\.
This worked well (there is a folder with a new python distribution). conda tells me to type 
activate C:\PR\TEMP\venv\test 
to activate the environment, however this returns:
No environment named "C:\PR\temp\venv\test" exists in C:\PR\Anaconda\envs
How can I activate the environment? What am I doing wrong?
Assistant: Window:
conda activate environment_name
Mac: conda activate environment_name
