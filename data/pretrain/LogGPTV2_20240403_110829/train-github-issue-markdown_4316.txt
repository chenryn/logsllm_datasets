**What happened** :
After upgrading from 1.10.10 to 1.10.11 (and also with new installs of
1.10.11) there are some permission warnings in the webserver logs:
    [2020-08-14 22:19:30,022] {manager.py:545} WARNING - Refused to delete permission view, assoc with role exists XComModelView.can_add Admin
    [2020-08-14 22:19:30,038] {manager.py:545} WARNING - Refused to delete permission view, assoc with role exists XComModelView.can_edit Admin
It seems to be directly related to #9614 that @kaxil introduced for 1.10.11
which removes the `can_add` and `can_edit` permissions from `XComModelView`,
but Airflow can not delete the permissions from that view because relations to
those permissions still exist on the "Admin" and "Op" roles.
In more technical terms, the two permissions can't be deleted from
`ab_permission_view` table because each have relations to both the Admin's and
Op's role_ids in the `ab_permission_view_role` table.
**What you expected to happen** :  
No warnings with Airflow 1.10.11
**How to reproduce it** :
  1. Install 1.10.11
  2. Either: 
    1. View the logs of the webserver
    2. Run any airflow CLI command, such as `airflow list_users` and view the outputted log messages
  3. After a few lines of the log you will see the warnings
**Anything else we need to know** :
If those 4 role permissions are removed from the `ab_permission_view_role`
table the warnings should stop. I think a migration needs to be added, or some
logic that cleans up these role permissions is failing to do its job.
