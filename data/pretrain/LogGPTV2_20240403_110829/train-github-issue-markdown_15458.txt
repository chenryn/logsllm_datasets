I am not able to push to GitHub from inside VS Code? The git output looks like
this:
    git push
    remote: Anonymous access to rmaclean/Website_DevConf.git denied.
    fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/rmaclean/Website_DevConf.git/'
â€‹The anonymous part is odd, since I am prompted for my credentials and they
are correct (I can use the command line tools fine). I am not using credential
helper at the moment.
