Assistant: Possible reasons are: 1. Improper application design, resulting in excessive CPU resource usage; 2. Operating system or network resource failure, resulting in high CPU utilization; 3. Hardware failure or improper configuration, resulting in high CPU load. Solution: 1. Analyze the performance of the application program, find out the bottleneck that causes the high CPU utilization rate, and optimize the program code; 2. Troubleshoot the operating system or network resource failure, and repair the failure in time; 3. Check whether the hardware configuration is reasonable, and Carry out corresponding upgrades or replacements; 4. Reasonably plan the usage time of the application program, avoid using it during peak hours, and reduce the CPU load.
