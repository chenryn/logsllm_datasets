ABSTRACT
User location can act as an additional factor of authentication in
scenarios where physical presence is required, such as when mak-
ing in-person purchases or unlocking a vehicle. This paper pro-
poses a novel approach for estimating user location and modeling
user movement using the Internet of Things (IoT). Our goal is to
utilize its scale and diversity to estimate location more robustly,
than solutions based on smartphones alone, and stop adversaries
from using compromised user credentials (e.g., stolen keys, pass-
words, etc.), when sufﬁcient evidence physically locates them else-
where. To locate users, we leverage the increasing number of IoT
devices carried and used by them and the smart environments that
observe these devices. We also exploit the ability of many IoT de-
vices to “sense” the user. To demonstrate our approach, we build a
system, called Icelus. Our experiments with it show that it exhibits
a smaller false-rejection rate than smartphone-based location-based
authentication (LBA) and it rejects attackers with few errors (i.e.,
false acceptances).

INTRODUCTION
Electronic user authentication is increasingly used in the physi-
cal world, where it is frequently employed to protect ﬁnancial trans-
actions and to control access to physical spaces and vehicles. Typ-
ical means to authenticate users entry include passwords and PIN
codes, tokens (e.g., smartcards), and biometrics (e.g., ﬁngerprints).

Cards are frequently used to unlock doors, mainly in ofﬁces, ei-
ther through swiping the card through a reader or by proximity of
an RFID-based card to the reader. Smart locks (e.g., Kevo) enable
user’s to use their smartphone instead of a key, while an increasing
number of vehicles use wireless key fobs to unlock their doors and
start the engine. Credit and debit cards, and even smartphones to-
day, also act as tokens that (usually) along with a PIN code enable
users to authorize transactions.
While these advances have improved convenience and even se-
curity, they are not without problems. Fraudsters engage in var-
ious forms of deception for ﬁnancial gain, like in Japan where
$13m were stolen from ATMs [24]. The methods employed in-
volve stealing, cloning, and counterfeiting credit and debit cards to
perform transactions at Point of Sale (POS) [5, 43]. In many coun-
tries such attacks are bolstered further by the limited deployment of
PIN and chip technology [28]. Systems like Android Pay and Ap-
ple Pay, that enable users to pay with their smartphones or smart-
wearables, can also be compromised if the PIN code [11,52] or bio-
metric [1, 12] used is bypassed. Door and car locks have also suf-
fered various types of attacks including cloning RFID cards [15],
relaying signals [23], and exploiting weakness in the authentication
protocols [60, 63].
The state of the art in authentication mandates using multi-factor
authentication, that is, combining a secret, a token, and a biomet-
ric. Interestingly, card-based ﬁnancial transactions already use two
factors, a PIN code and a card token. Security is compromised by
eavesdropping the PIN (e.g., through tampered terminals) and cre-
ating a copy of the card. In other cases, multi-factor authentication
is not used correctly [19] or not used at all because of usability is-
sues [2]. Biometrics, such as ﬁngerprints, have also been found to
be vulnerable to attacks [12, 58] and to reduce utility [40, 48].
Certain promising approaches employ user location as an ad-
ditional factor of authentication for ﬁnancial transactions [22, 41,
46]. They exploit the fact that users rarely get separated from their
smartphones [29] and use them to either conﬁrm the user’s location
or transparently provide location as an authentication factor. These
approaches can fail if the smartphone is not present or not opera-
tional [18] (e.g., due to limited battery life), which may have stiﬂed
their broad deployment. Smartphones and other portable devices
have also been used in proximity-based authentication [32].
In this paper, we propose using the Internet of Things (IoT) to
model user location and movement for making user location con-
tinuously available as an additional factor of authentication, inde-
pendently of whether a device is available (online) when the user
authenticates. In contrast to prior works in location-based authen-
tication (LBA) works, we argue that using the increasing number
of smart things that users carry, wear, drive, or even have in their
body, enables more robust methods for estimating user location. In
other words, it allows us to estimate the location of users despite
individual devices being ofﬂine or not with them.
IoT devices can help us locate their user by reporting their loca-
tion (e.g., through GPS or WiFi) or by proximity to other devices
with known coordinates (e.g., wearables). Smart environments can
also “observe” user things. For example, access points, smart-home
hubs, etc. can report which devices are connected, ﬁnancial insti-
tutions can report when and where a credit card is used, and smart
trafﬁc lights can report the location of vehicles. However, IoT de-
vices can do much more, they can “sense” when they are being
used. For instance, wrist wearables know when they are being worn
because they sense walking and/or the user’s heartbeat, and a smart-
phone that has just been unlocked with a PIN or ﬁngerprint knows
that the user is holding it. This is crucial in estimating whether a
user is with a set of devices, as we no longer need to assume that
users are de-facto with their smartphone, smartwatch, etc.
We couple location and activity data reported by devices to model
users and their movement. Maintaining such a model enables us to
estimate how likely it is that a user is at a particular location, with-
out relying on any device being available and able to provide the
user’s location at the moment of authentication. Moreover, it en-
ables us to use potentially-sparse data, as certain IoT devices may
only report occasionally.
Another factor differentiating this work from previous ones is
the way we use location data. Querying parties are not allowed to
ask for the coordinates of any user device. Instead, they can place
generic queries such as “Can the user be physically present at this
location?” By only allowing such queries, we inhibit “curious” ser-
vices from attempting to arbitrarily locate the user. More important,
to respond to queries, we rely on evidence indicating that user is not
at a given location. For example, we respond negatively, only if we
are conﬁdent that a user is not at a location. This strategy serves
a twofold goal; ﬁrst, to prevent falsely rejecting users that forget
at home or have inoperable devices and, second, to prevent stolen
devices from being misused to subvert the system.
To demonstrate our approach, we design and develop Icelus, a
system that collects location and activity data from IoT devices to
model user movement and location. Icelus can run as a service on
a device of the user, such as a smart-home hub [30], or it can be
hosted in the cloud [42]. To collect data, it organizes the various
devices in a hierarchy, so that the ones with Internet connectivity
can relay the data of the ones without to the system. Third-party
systems can also provide data by directly connecting to Icelus or
indirectly by forwarding notiﬁcations of certain events (e.g., the
use of a credit card at a location, an entry in the user’s calendar,
etc.). To alleviate privacy concerns, we also develop a privacy-
preserving extension of the protocol used in Icelus that allows us to
operate purely on distances, without revealing the actual locations
of individual devices. At the core of the extension is a secure multi-
party computation protocol that leverages additively homomorphic
encryption and blinding. Finally, we evaluate Icelus by deploying
it on set of devices readily available today.
• We propose a new approach that utilizes the IoT to estimate the
location of a user and use it as an additional factor of authentica-
tion that is more robust that smartphone-only approaches .
• We develop a user movement model using the location data pro-
vided by IoT devices, which enables us to operate even when
devices are not reachable.
Brieﬂy, our contributions are the following:

• We deﬁne a method for determining the probability (referred to
as conﬁdence score) that the user actually is with a set of his
devices, utilizing both the number of devices present and the user
activities captured by device sensors.

• We evaluate our approach by deploying Icelus on a set of devices
readily available today and performing two ﬁeld studies. Our re-
sults show that we can achieve a false-rejection rate of 4%-6%,
which is lower than that of smartphone-based location-based au-
thentication. At the same time, we are more resilient to attacks.
We also evaluate the performance of our approach and ﬁnd that it
imposes negligible overhead on the devices tested of below 1%.

2. THREAT MODEL
The attacks we aim to thwart in this paper include attempts to by-
pass user authentication with physical objects and terminals to gain
unauthorized access to places, property, etc. of the user, as well as
third-parties. Such attacks may include compromising passwords,
security tokens (e.g., swipe cards and USB keys), or biometrics.
We do not assume that the user’s devices have not been compro-
mised, instead our model considers that they could be physically
stolen, tampered, or remotely compromised. We rely on the scale
of the IoT for resistance to subversion. Our goal is to maintain
correct operation, as long as the majority of devices have not been
compromised.
3. APPROACH OVERVIEW
We propose using the IoT to estimate where a user can possibly
be and use the conﬁdence of our estimations to augment physical
security decisions. For example, if someone enters the credentials
of a user at a known physical location, such as a door keypad, we
want to be able to answer the question “Can the user be in front
of the door at this time?” Being able to answer this question will
improve security, as the presentation of credentials on physical ter-
minals without the legitimate user being present can indicate that
a credential has been stolen or compromised. Our approach can
enable policies that reject credentials or request additional identi-
ﬁcation, when it is determined that the user cannot physically be
at the point of authentication (e.g., activate multi-factor authentica-
tion).
3.1 Viewing the Real World Through the IoT
An increasing number of objects contain computational and net-
working capabilities. The Internet of Things consists of objects that
are carried by users or reside in their environment. They are able to
sense each other (e.g., through Bluetooth) and frequently commu-
nicate with each other. They are also able to sense the environment
and their user, e.g., wrist wearables can sense the heartbeat of the
wearer.
We claim that through the IoT we can glimpse into the physical
world to establish the location of their users. For example, accord-
ing to a study 79% of people aged 18–44 have their smartphones
with them 22 hours a day [29]. Smartphones can also establish their
location by using information from network base stations, GPS,
and WiFi, hence, they provide a strong indicator of their owner’s
location. Other objects, like tablets or modern cars, also come with
Internet connectivity and GPS, but may be shared among a few peo-
ple, like the owner’s family. They also provide hints, albeit weaker
ones than smartphones, on the location of at least one of its usual
3.2 Modeling User Location and Movement
We model users through Avatars, essentially their representa-
tions in the digital world, and multiple Avatars may concurrently
exist for the same user. The location of an Avatar can be updated
whenever information, including location information, is received
from an IoT device. Since location reporting is not continuous,
due to limited resources and connectivity, user movement must
also be taken into account to enable meaningful location-possibility
queries at any given time. User movement speed can be estimated
using recent location reports and device sensor data [37]. How-
ever, we can also model certain vehicles or modes of transportation.
Users walking, driving, or cycling can attain speeds within well es-
tablished parameters. So by estimating an Avatar’s speed, we can
at any point establish the range of an Avatar, i.e., without making
any assumptions on its direction remaining consistent, we can de-
ﬁne the region where it is physically possible for the actual user to
be. Additional physical world characteristics, like terrain and road
networks, can also be incorporated to more accurately establish the
range of an Avatar. For example, when on a car, the user is limited
to driving on roads. However, we do not explore them in this paper.
The advantage of modeling the user is that we can remain oper-
ational even if there are inaccuracies in the reported data, location
