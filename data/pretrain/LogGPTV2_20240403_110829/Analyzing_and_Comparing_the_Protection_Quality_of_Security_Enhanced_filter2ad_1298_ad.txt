### 5. Comparing SELinux with AppArmor

To evaluate our approach, we use three attack scenarios:

1. **Remote Attacker Installing a Rootkit:**
   - **Assumption:** The rootkit is installed by loading a kernel module.
   
2. **Remote Attacker Planting a Trojan Horse:**
   - **Definitions:**
     - **Strong Trojan Case:** The attacker can create an executable in a folder on the executable search path or in the user’s home directory.
     - **Weak Trojan Case:** The attacker can create an executable in any folder such that a normal user process (with a user’s UID and running under an unconstrained domain in SELinux or not confined by any profile in AppArmor) can execute it.
   - **Condition:** After execution, the trojan process should be unconstrained.
   
3. **Local Attacker Installing a Rootkit:**
   - **Objective:** To install a rootkit by loading a kernel module.

### Analysis of Quality of Protection (QoP)

We analyze the QoP under several configurations:

1. **Ubuntu 8.04 (Server Edition):**
   - **SELinux and AppArmor:** To understand the additional protection MAC offers over DAC, we also evaluate Ubuntu 8.04 with only DAC protection (no MAC).

2. **Fedora 8 with SELinux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 with AppArmor:**
   - **Comparison:** We compare the results with Ubuntu 8.04/SELinux and Ubuntu 8.04/AppArmor to show that different distributions with the same mechanism provide different levels of protection.

3. **Ubuntu 8.04 with SELinux:**
   - **Evaluation Focus:** Only the SELinux policy is analyzed to demonstrate that considering only MAC policy without DAC policy and system state is insufficient.

### Active Services
- **Services Include:** `sshd`, `vsftp`, `apache2`, `samba`, `mysql-server`, `postfix`, `nfsd`, `named`, etc.
- **SELinux Policy (Fedora 8):** Targeted policy shipped with the distribution.
- **SELinux Policy (Ubuntu 8.04):** Reference policy from the SELinux package.
- **AppArmor Policy:** From the `apparmor-profiles` package.

### 5.1. SELinux vs. AppArmor vs. DAC Only on Ubuntu 8.04

Ubuntu 8.04 Server Edition supports both SELinux and AppArmor, providing an opportunity for a head-to-head comparison. We also include the case where only DAC is used.

#### Remote Attacker Installing a Rootkit
- **Scenario:** The attacker has network access to the host and aims to install a rootkit via a kernel module.
- **Host Attack Graphs:**
  - **DAC Only:** Figure 10
  - **AppArmor:** Figure 11
  - **SELinux:** Figure 12
  - **Comparison of Minimal Attack Paths (SELinux vs. AppArmor):** Figure 13

**Findings:**
- **Vulnerability Surface:**
  - **AppArmor:** Smallest vulnerability surface.
  - **SELinux:** Has all the minimal attack paths of AppArmor plus some additional ones.
  - **DAC Only:** Has all the attack paths of SELinux and one additional minimal attack path.
- **Minimal Attack Paths:**
  - **AppArmor:** 3 length-1 and 34 length-2 minimal attack paths.
  - **SELinux:** 6 length-1 and 97 length-2 minimal attack paths.
  - **Common Paths:** Due to daemon programs running in an unconstrained domain under SELinux and not confined by profiles under AppArmor.
  - **Unique Paths (SELinux):** 
    - Some programs run in the unconstrained domain under SELinux but are confined by AppArmor (e.g., `nmbd`, `smbd`, `vsftpd`, `portmap`, `rpc.statd`).
    - Some SELinux confinements are not as tight as corresponding AppArmor profiles (e.g., `cupsd`, `dhclient`).
    - Some programs (e.g., `named`, `mysqld`) are not confined in either SELinux or AppArmor, but run with unprivileged accounts under DAC.

#### Remote Attacker Leaving a Trojan Horse
- **Strong Trojan Case:**
  - **AppArmor (Ubuntu 8.04):** One extra attack path compared to loading a kernel module: `/usr/sbin/smbd`.
  - **SELinux (Ubuntu 8.04):** Host attack graph is the same as for installing a rootkit.
- **Weak Trojan Case:**
  - **Easier to Perform:** Both SELinux and AppArmor confine only a subset of known programs and do not perform information flow tracking.
  - **Host Attack Graph (Weak Trojan, SELinux):** Figure 14

#### Local Attacker Installing a Rootkit
- **Scenario:** The attacker has a local account and aims to install a rootkit by loading a kernel module.
- **Host Attack Graphs:**
  - **SELinux (Ubuntu 8.04):** Figure 15
  - **AppArmor (Ubuntu 8.04):** Figure 16

**Findings:**
- **Vulnerability Surface:**
  - **AppArmor:** Smaller vulnerability surface.
  - **SELinux:** Has all the minimal attack paths of AppArmor plus some additional ones.
- **Common Minimal Attack Paths:**
  - **19 Length-1 Paths:** Due to 19 setuid root programs with sufficient privileges.
  - **Unique Paths (SELinux):** `/bin/ping` and `/usr/bin/passwd`.

### 5.2. Other Comparisons

#### Different Versions of SELinux
- **Fedora 8 (Targeted Policy):** Offers significantly better protection than SELinux in Ubuntu 8.04.
- **Why Considering MAC Policy Alone is Not Enough:**
  - **Reason:** The effectiveness of MAC policies depends on the specific configuration and the interaction with DAC and the overall system state.

This structured and detailed analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of the security mechanisms and their effectiveness in different scenarios.
