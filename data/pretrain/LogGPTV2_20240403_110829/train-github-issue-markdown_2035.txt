Certainly! To make the text more clear, coherent, and professional, you can provide some context and explanation. Here's an optimized version:

```javascript
// Example of a string containing special characters
const str = `bar/*`;
```

If you want to add more context or explain why this string is being used, you can do so as follows:

```javascript
// Example of a string that includes special characters such as a forward slash and an asterisk
// This string might be used in scenarios where pattern matching or regular expressions are involved
const str = `bar/*`;
```

This provides a clearer and more professional presentation of the code snippet.
