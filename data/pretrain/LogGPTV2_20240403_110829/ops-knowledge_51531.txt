User: I'm new to Python, and using Google App Engine, which is currently running only Python 2.5.  Are there any built-in ways of doing an ordered dictionary, or do I have to implement something custom?
Assistant: OrderedDict is new in 2.7, so no, there's no built-in way to do this - you'll have to implement your own.
Usually, an ordered dictionary is implemented as a dictionary of linked list nodes, linked in traversal order. This should be fairly straightforward to implement yourself.
