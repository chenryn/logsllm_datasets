There's `nextTab` and `prevTab`, but since I work in a single-tab, multi-pane
environment, those keybindings do nothing for me. How about being able to bind
`ctrl+tab` to `nextPanel`?
(Would fit in nicely with the rest of #1000 .)
_Edit: I can't believe I typoed that last`nextPanel` as `nextTab`, making the
sentence and request completely nonsensical._ :D
