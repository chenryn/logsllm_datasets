User: I have created a VM on Windows Azure with Ubuntu 12.04 running on it.
I have two end-points
End-point1
public port: 50348
private port: 22
End-point2
public port: 81
private port: 81
Now, I have a simple python HTTP server running on the Virtual Machine, which is listening on port 81.  
When I try to connect to localhost:81 from within the Virtual machine, I am able to connect, so I know that the server is up and running.
Say, the DNS name assigned to my VM be blah-blah.cloudapp.net
But, when I try to connect to http://blah-blah.cloudapp.net:81 from somewhere outside, I always get a Server Not Found error.
So, how can I connect to my server?
Assistant: Could it be that port 81 is blocked by firewall in Ubuntu?
