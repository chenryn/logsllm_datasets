I have set up a virtual machine (VM) on Windows Azure, running Ubuntu 12.04. The VM has two endpoints configured as follows:

- **Endpoint 1:**
  - Public Port: 50348
  - Private Port: 22

- **Endpoint 2:**
  - Public Port: 81
  - Private Port: 81

I have a simple Python HTTP server running on the VM, listening on port 81. When I attempt to connect to `localhost:81` from within the VM, the connection is successful, indicating that the server is operational.

The DNS name assigned to my VM is `blah-blah.cloudapp.net`. However, when I try to access the server from an external location using `http://blah-blah.cloudapp.net:81`, I consistently receive a "Server Not Found" error.

**Question:** How can I resolve this issue and successfully connect to my server?

**Possible Cause:**
- It's possible that port 81 is being blocked by the firewall on the Ubuntu system.

**Steps to Troubleshoot:**

1. **Check Firewall Rules:**
   - Verify if the firewall on your Ubuntu VM is blocking port 81. You can check the current firewall rules using the `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) command:
     ```sh
     sudo ufw status
     ```
   - If port 81 is not allowed, you can add a rule to allow it:
     ```sh
     sudo ufw allow 81/tcp
     ```

2. **Verify Endpoint Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the endpoint configuration in the Azure portal is correctly set up to forward traffic from the public port 81 to the private port 81 on your VM.

3. **Check Network Security Group (NSG):**
   - Verify that the Network Security Group (NSG) associated with your VM or subnet allows inbound traffic on port 81.

4. **Test Connectivity:**
   - Use tools like `telnet` or `curl` to test connectivity from an external machine:
     ```sh
     telnet blah-blah.cloudapp.net 81
     ```
     or
     ```sh
     curl http://blah-blah.cloudapp.net:81
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing external access to your Python HTTP server.
