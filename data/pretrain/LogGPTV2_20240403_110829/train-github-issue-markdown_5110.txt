I investigated this and found out that it appears on table cells with newline
involved. Example:
    ### Properties
    | Name | Type | Default | Description |
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
    | containerElement | PropTypes.oneOfType([  
      PropTypes.string,
      PropTypes.element,
    ]) |  |  The element to use as the container for the RaisedButton. Either a string to use a DOM element or a ReactElement. This is useful for wrapping the RaisedButton in a custom Link component. If a ReactElement is given, ensure that it passes all of its given props through to the underlying DOM element and renders its children prop for proper integration. |
Notice the _PropTypes.oneOfType_. So to fix this we have to add `` tags
like this:
    ### Properties
    | Name | Type | Default | Description |
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
    | containerElement | PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string,PropTypes.element,]) |  |  The element to use as the container for the RaisedButton. Either a string to use a DOM element or a ReactElement. This is useful for wrapping the RaisedButton in a custom Link component. If a ReactElement is given, ensure that it passes all of its given props through to the underlying DOM element and renders its children prop for proper integration. |
Result is:
### Properties
Name | Type | Default | Description  
---|---|---|---  
containerElement | PropTypes.oneOfType([  
PropTypes.string,  
PropTypes.element,  
]) |  | The element to use as the container for the RaisedButton. Either a
string to use a DOM element or a ReactElement. This is useful for wrapping the
RaisedButton in a custom Link component. If a ReactElement is given, ensure
that it passes all of its given props through to the underlying DOM element
and renders its children prop for proper integration.
