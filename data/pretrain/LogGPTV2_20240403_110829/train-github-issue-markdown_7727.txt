Hello and sorry, in case this doesn't belong here.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
My application should still work after upgrading to react 16.
## Current Behavior
When opening Modals/Drawers in cordova i get a whitescreen due to:
    Material-UI: you are most likely evaluating the code before the
    browser has a chance to reach the .
    Please move the import at the end of the .
    Cannot read property 'children' of null", source: http://localhost:12416/packages/modules.js?hash=ae58e0b4a06841e8623d6981b97ea750b49e01d2 (115282)
    "The above error occurred in the  component:
    in Modal (created by withStyles(Modal))
    in withStyles(Modal) (created by Drawer)
    in Drawer (created by withStyles(Drawer))
My gut feeling is that it's somehow related to portal handling in
https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/v1-beta/src/internal/Portal.js but
i'm not sure.
I dug a bit into the source and finally I know where the error comes from:
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Not sure how to provide a "simple codebox" as you basically have to bundle an
app in cordova.  
I'm opening this ticket in hope someone has an idea, but will continue
debugging and eventually create a pr to fix this.
## Context
I'm working on a pp which is shipped as web and cordova. Since upgrading to
react 16 drawers are broken, but I also tested modals which are used by
drawers and seem to be broken to.
