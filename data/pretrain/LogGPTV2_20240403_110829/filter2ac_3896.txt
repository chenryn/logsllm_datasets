### Title: Exploiting CNC Technologies in the EU-22 Blackhat Context

CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines are widely used in production plants and are a critical asset for organizations globally. The push towards Industry 4.0 has led to the integration of advanced connectivity technologies, including those for CNCs. As a result, modern CNC machines have evolved into fully-fledged systems, offering a range of networking services for smart connectivity. However, this shift to a more complex and software-dependent ecosystem has also made these machines more vulnerable to potential threats.

In our research, we examined the risks associated with the technological advancements in numerical controls. We conducted an empirical evaluation of four leading controller manufacturers, analyzing the technologies they introduced to meet the demands of Industry 4.0. We also performed a series of practical attacks on real-world CNC installations to assess their security vulnerabilities.

Our findings revealed that malicious actors could exploit these technologies to carry out various attacks, including denial-of-service, damage, hijacking, and theft. We reported our findings to the affected vendors and proposed mitigation strategies to address these vulnerabilities.

This presentation aims to raise awareness about the importance of security in the CNC domain, where, unfortunately, security is not yet considered a top priority.
