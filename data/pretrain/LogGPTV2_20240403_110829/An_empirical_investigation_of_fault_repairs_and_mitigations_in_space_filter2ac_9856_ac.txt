to right, the bits in the Corrective Action set vector denote
whether the mitigation types shown in Table I are contained
in the corrective actions for a failure report. For example, the
ﬁrst row in Table III indicates corrective actions containing
only ﬁxes/patches. The ﬁfth row indicates corrective actions
containing ﬁxes/patches and reboots. Finally, the corrective
action set in the sixth row applies to those failures for which
mitigating actions could not be identiﬁed. The Corrective
Action Sets are a high-level abstraction of the information
contained in the failure reports;
they do not contain any
information about the order in which the mitigating actions
were taken, or the number of actions of each mitigation type
that were performed.
For each Corrective Action Set, the relative frequency with
which it occurs for BOHs, NAMs, and ARBs is noted in the
ﬁrst three columns of Table III. The last two columns show
the relative frequencies for all Mandelbugs (i.e., for NAMs
and ARBs taken together), as well as for all three fault types
taken together.
The last row of this table indicates the total number of faults
of each type present in the data we analyzed.
For each fault type – BOH, NAM, and ARB – the most
frequent 75% (or more) of the Corrective Action Sets contain
only a single type of mitigating action. The related mitigation
types are Fix/Patch, Workaround (WA) and Use as is (UAI).
For our subsequent analysis, we collapsed the Corrective Ac-
tion Sets shown in Table III down to three partially overlapping
sets: those Corrective Action Sets containing ﬁxes/patches,
those containing workarounds, and those containing a “use
as is” disposition. The sets are partially overlapping in that a
failure report can lead to mitigation actions of several different

types, and therefore more than one of the three sets may apply
to it. We also consider those sets containing WA and/or UAI
to observe the proportion of mitigating actions which included
at least one of these techniques, as opposed to those actions
which did not include either of them. Although there was some
overlap between the Corrective Action Sets, Table III indicates
that this overlap was not substantial.
Table IV lists the relative frequencies with which the
corrective actions for each type of fault (BOH, NAM, or ARB)
included the three types of mitigating actions. Because the
Corrective Action Sets overlap, the sum of the frequencies for
three distinct mitigation types Fix/Patch, WA, and UAI will
total more than 1, as will the sum of the frequencies for the
mitigation types Fix/Patch and WA+UAI.
Table V shows this same information for two combined
sets of faults – NAM and ARB taken together, then BOH,
NAM, and ARB taken together. Our goal in this analysis is
to determine whether the frequencies of mitigation types are
similar or distinguishable for the different kinds of faults.
Table IV indicates that for the three fault types the frequen-
cies of each of the three mitigation types are different. Over
75% of the mitigating actions associated with BOHs include
a ﬁx, while less than half those associated with NAMs do so.
By contrast, little more than 25% of the mitigating actions
associated with BOHs include a workaround or a “use as is,”
while this is the case for 60% of those associated with NAMs.
Note that the frequency with which the mitigating actions
associated with an ARB include development of a workaround
is close to that of NAMs. However, while the frequency
with which mitigating an ARB involves ﬁxes is much lower
than that for BOHs, it is considerably higher than that for
NAMs. Similarly, “use as is” dispositions are much rarer for
ARBs than for NAMs. We will discuss this in more detail in
Section V.
We next examine the proportions of mitigation type frequen-
cies for individual missions to determine whether the frequen-
cies shown in Table IV and Table V change from mission to
mission. The details are contained in Tables VI–IX. Columns
2–4 of these tables give the frequencies of mitigating actions

Table VI lists the frequencies of each mitigation type for
Bohrbugs in all eight missions. For every mission, we see
that mitigating actions involving ﬁxes occur more frequently
