User: Certain applications like hellanzb have a way of printing to the terminal with the appearance of dynamically refreshing data, kind of like top().
Whats the best method in python for doing this?  I have read up on logging and curses, but don't know what to use.  I am creating a reimplementation of top.  If you have any other suggestions I am open to them as well.
Assistant: When I do this in shell scripts on Unix, I tend to just use the clear program.  You can use the Python subprocess module to execute it.  It will at least get you what you're looking for quickly.
