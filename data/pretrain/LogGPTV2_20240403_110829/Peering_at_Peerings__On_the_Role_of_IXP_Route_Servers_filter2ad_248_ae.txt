below.
7. CHANGE CHANGES THINGS
With our IXP datasets, we are observing an Internet peering
ecosystem in ﬂux. With more IXPs operating RSes, more mem-
bers peer multi-laterally and connect to more than one IXP. In this
section, we examine in more detail how IXP peerings at the L-IXP
change over time and how the common members at the L-IXP and
the M-IXP use those IXPs.
7.1 Same IXP: IXP peerings over time
Taking advantage of our historical collection of sFlow records
from L-IXP, we perform a longitudinal study of the IXP peerings
at this IXP. To examine the relationship between BL and ML peer-
ings during the last 2+ years, we focus on the trafﬁc-carrying peer-
ings and rely on the methodology described in the latter part of
Section 4.1 to infer BL peerings. The results are depicted in Fig-
ure 8 and illustrate that while the total number of observed trafﬁc-
carrying links has increased noticeably during this time period, the
number of BL peerings has only increased slightly. Thus, the ob-
served increase in the number of trafﬁc-carrying peerings is mainly
due to the proliferation of ML peerings. Taking into account our
earlier observation that only about 85% (24%) of symmetric (asym-
metric) ML peerings do carry actual trafﬁc, we can conclude that
the number of established ML peerings exceeds the number of trafﬁc-
carrying ML peerings by some 5-10k links. At the same time, we
ﬁnd that the ratio of total BL peering trafﬁc to total ML peering traf-
ﬁc has stayed constant at around 65–67% (not shown), a reminder
that from a trafﬁc perspective one has to consider both types of
peerings.
To examine in more detail the dynamics of peerings over time,
we consider next ﬁve different two-week snapshots of sFlow data,
dating back to 2011. For each snapshot, we identify the trafﬁc-
carrying BL peerings and tag the remaining trafﬁc-carrying links as

that while the member ASes at M-IXP use predominantly ML peer-
ings, it is more often the case that the member ASes use BL peering
at the L-IXP. In fact, the BL peerings common to both IXPs make
up almost half of all trafﬁc-carrying BL peerings at M-IXP.
To illustrate the common members’ contributions to the trafﬁc
volume at the two IXPs, Figure 10 shows for all common member
ASes that exchange trafﬁc at the two IXPs how their normalized
trafﬁc shares compare. The scatter-plot shows for each common
member AS the fraction of its trafﬁc at the L-IXP (x-axis) vs. the
fraction of its trafﬁc at the M-IXP, where we normalize by all traf-
ﬁc over the common peerings. The observed clustering around the
diagonal is an indication that the common member ASes’ (rela-
tive) contributions to the respective overall peering trafﬁc at the
two IXPs are similar. A similar strong clustering can also be seen
when examining the common members’ contributions at the level
of common peering links (not shown).
The overall picture that emerges from studying the common mem-
ber ASes at the two IXPs and how they use the different IXPs is
consistent with their proﬁles (see Section 3). For example, the ASes
in the upper right corner of Figure 10 are the well-known big con-
tent providers/CDNs and make extensive use of both IXPs – they
use the L-IXP because of its global role as a critical hub in today’s
Internet, and they are at M-IXP because of its mainly regional role
as a place for small-medium eyeball networks to connect. On the
other hand, the few outliers in Figure 10 (e.g., point in upper left
and points in lower right) are typically smaller regional networks
that prefer one IXP over the other for reasons such as location,
reach, and needs. In addition, for the latter to establish connec-
tivity at the two IXPs via the IXPs’ RSes is very low overhead and
justiﬁes membership at the IXPs, irrespective of any imminent need
to exchange trafﬁc.
Summary
Our longitudinal analysis of the L-IXP shows that while its RS is
clearly the main driver for increasing connectivity among member
ASes at this IXP, the trafﬁc ratio between BL and ML peering stays
largely constant, with BL peerings accounting for twice as much
trafﬁc. Switch-overs from ML to BL peering typically occur when
there is an increase of trafﬁc carried over that link. For ASes that
are members at two IXPs, we observe that peering links with other
networks are largely consistent across the different IXPs. We also
notice that the relative trafﬁc contributions of members peering at
our two IXPs exhibit strong correlations. This is also the case for
common trafﬁc-carrying peerings between the same ASes across
IXPs.

ML peerings. Then we check if the same trafﬁc-carrying peerings
that are present in two consecutive snapshots have changed their
peering type or not (see Table 5). Although some small amount
of churn could result from our inability to detect all BL sessions
in a given snapshot (see Section 4.1), we observe that the number
of changes from ML-to-BL and BL-to-ML, respectively, are rela-
tively stable. The churn caused by ML peerings being replaced by
BL peerings is consistently higher than the churn that is due to the
peering types changing from BL to ML. We also notice that the
trafﬁc volume on these peerings increases substantially if the type
changes from ML to BL. In contrast, a peering type change from
BL to ML typically goes along with a signiﬁcant decrease in the
amount of trafﬁc that gets exchanged. These observations support
the argument that BL peerings are typically established and used if
there is signiﬁcant trafﬁc volume that may or may not need addi-
tional BGP capabilities (see e.g., [5]). Another reason for encoun-
tering more ML-to-BL than BL-to-ML changes is that when new
members join an IXP, they typically start with ML peerings and
may switch later on to BL peerings with a subset of IXP member
ASes.
7.2 Different IXPs: Common members
We next perform a comparative analysis and check how networks
make use of the two IXPs that cover by and large the same geo-
graphic region. The two IXPs have 50 members in common (see
Table 1). Figure 9 summarizes the results of our comparison with
respect to connectivity (i.e., peerings and peering type) and trafﬁc.
Of these 50 common ASes, more than 75% use consistent peering
setups in the sense that if they are peering/not peering with one
another at one IXP, they also do so at the other IXP. At the same
time, more than 20% do peer at one IXP but not at the other IXP.
However, not all of these peerings see trafﬁc, and the percentages
of trafﬁc-carrying peerings are reported in the second sub-table of
Figure 9. As far a the types of these trafﬁc-carrying peerings are
concerned, we observe that in 46% of the cases ML peering is used
at both locations and BL peering in 28% of the cases. This observa-
tion is consistent with the overall picture (not presented) and shows

8. CASE STUDIES
In this section, we take a closer look at some of the well-known
major players in today’s Internet that send signiﬁcant trafﬁc over
the public switching fabrics of either L-IXP or M-IXP. We are in-
terested in understanding how they make use of these IXPs so that
we can reason about their choices of peering options, and assess
whether there are typical patterns for ASes of the same business
type.
8.1 Our cast of big players
Our selection of “big players” was driven by the volume of traf-
ﬁc they exchange at L-IXP or M-IXP, by the type of businesses
they represent, and by their geographic reach. To this end, we
chose two ASes that are responsible for a signiﬁcant share of con-
tent in today’s Internet and are among the top trafﬁc contributors
at both IXPs where each of their trafﬁc share is over 10% (C1 and
C2). Moreover, we picked two popular Online Social Networks
(OSN) that use the IXPs extensively (OSN1 and OSN2), two re-
gional eyeball providers (EYE2 and EYE1), and two Tier-1s (T1-1
and T1-2).
There are two basic observations from our characterization work
described in the previous sections. First, the big content providers
and the regional eyeball networks are actively using the IXPs’ RSes
and peer openly, most likely to reduce transit cost and reduce la-
tency. On the other hand, the Tier-1s which include some of the
major eyeball networks with presence in Europe and overseas peer
more restrictively and often do not use the RS. Our ﬁndings about
the selected players are summarized in Table 6 and show some un-
expected yet important differences.
In the case of the two major content providers, we note that C1
exchanges most of its trafﬁc via BL peerings. However, this con-
tent provider actively markets the RS connectivity and maintains
many ML peering sessions. On the other hand, C2 exchanges more
than half of its trafﬁc via the ML peerings and we notice an in-
creasing tendency towards ML peerings for this player over the last
two years. In both cases, their preﬁxes are openly advertised to all
members and we see 100% resp. 99% of the trafﬁc sent towards
these members covered by the preﬁxes they advertise via the RS.
When examining the two OSNs, the most striking ﬁnding is that
they approach peering completely different, choosing the two ex-
tremes of the spectrum of available peering options. On the one
hand, OSN1 only offers BL peering and is not present at the IXPs’
RS. A likely reason is that this OSN wants to have control over its
trafﬁc ﬂows. On the other hand, OSN2 only does ML peering at
IXPs like L-IXP that are outside of this OSN’s home country. In
fact, their publicly announced peering policy states that they try to
avoid BL BGP sessions wherever peering using a RS is possible. A
plausible reason to choose this option is to reduce the administra-
tive overhead associated with BL peering.
As for the Tier-1s, in contrast to the US where Tier-1s typically
do not use the IXPs’ public switching fabrics, many Tier-1s connect
at L-IXP, including our players T1-1 and T1-2. One of them
also connects at M-IXP. Focusing on our two Tier-1s, they all use
a selective peering policy which is often interpreted to mean that
they do not use the RS. While this is true for most of them, we see
some exceptions. T1-1, for example, does indeed not use the RS
at all at either of the IXPs. While T1-2 connects to the L-IXP RS,
it tags all of its routes with the NO-EXPORT community which
implies that none of them are shared with any of the other ASes
