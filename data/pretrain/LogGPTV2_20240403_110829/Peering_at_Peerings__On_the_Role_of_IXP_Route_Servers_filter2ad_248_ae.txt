### 7. CHANGE CHANGES THINGS

Using our IXP datasets, we observe an evolving Internet peering ecosystem. As more IXPs operate Route Servers (RSes), more members engage in multilateral peerings and connect to multiple IXPs. In this section, we examine the changes in IXP peerings at L-IXP over time and how common members at L-IXP and M-IXP utilize these IXPs.

#### 7.1 Same IXP: IXP Peerings Over Time

Leveraging our historical collection of sFlow records from L-IXP, we conducted a longitudinal study of IXP peerings. To analyze the relationship between bilateral (BL) and multilateral (ML) peerings over the past two years, we focused on traffic-carrying peerings and used the methodology described in Section 4.1 to infer BL peerings. The results, shown in Figure 8, indicate that while the total number of observed traffic-carrying links has increased significantly, the number of BL peerings has only increased slightly. This suggests that the increase in traffic-carrying peerings is mainly due to the proliferation of ML peerings.

Considering our earlier observation that only about 85% (24%) of symmetric (asymmetric) ML peerings carry actual traffic, we can conclude that the number of established ML peerings exceeds the number of traffic-carrying ML peerings by approximately 5-10k links. Additionally, the ratio of total BL peering traffic to total ML peering traffic has remained constant at around 65–67%, indicating that both types of peerings must be considered from a traffic perspective.

To further investigate the dynamics of peerings over time, we analyzed five different two-week snapshots of sFlow data, dating back to 2011. For each snapshot, we identified the traffic-carrying BL peerings and tagged the remaining traffic-carrying links as ML peerings. We then checked if the same traffic-carrying peerings present in two consecutive snapshots had changed their peering type (see Table 5). Despite some churn due to our inability to detect all BL sessions (see Section 4.1), the number of changes from ML-to-BL and BL-to-ML remains relatively stable. The churn caused by ML peerings being replaced by BL peerings is consistently higher than the churn due to peering types changing from BL to ML. We also observed that the traffic volume on these peerings increases substantially when the type changes from ML to BL, while a change from BL to ML typically results in a significant decrease in traffic. These observations support the argument that BL peerings are typically established and used when there is significant traffic volume, possibly requiring additional BGP capabilities (see e.g., [5]). Another reason for encountering more ML-to-BL than BL-to-ML changes is that new members typically start with ML peerings and may switch later to BL peerings with a subset of IXP member ASes.

#### 7.2 Different IXPs: Common Members

Next, we performed a comparative analysis to check how networks use the two IXPs covering the same geographic region. The two IXPs have 50 members in common (see Table 1). Figure 9 summarizes the results of our comparison with respect to connectivity and traffic. Of these 50 common ASes, more than 75% use consistent peering setups, meaning they peer or do not peer with one another at both IXPs. However, more than 20% peer at one IXP but not at the other. Not all of these peerings see traffic, and the percentages of traffic-carrying peerings are reported in the second sub-table of Figure 9. Regarding the types of these traffic-carrying peerings, we observed that in 46% of cases, ML peering is used at both locations, and BL peering in 28% of cases. This observation is consistent with the overall picture and shows that ML peering is more prevalent among common members.

### 8. CASE STUDIES

In this section, we take a closer look at some of the well-known major players in today’s Internet that send significant traffic over the public switching fabrics of either L-IXP or M-IXP. We aim to understand how they use these IXPs, reason about their choices of peering options, and assess whether there are typical patterns for ASes of the same business type.

#### 8.1 Our Cast of Big Players

Our selection of "big players" was driven by the volume of traffic they exchange at L-IXP or M-IXP, the type of businesses they represent, and their geographic reach. We chose two ASes responsible for a significant share of content in today’s Internet and are among the top traffic contributors at both IXPs (C1 and C2). Additionally, we selected two popular Online Social Networks (OSN1 and OSN2), two regional eyeball providers (EYE1 and EYE2), and two Tier-1s (T1-1 and T1-2).

From our characterization work, we made two key observations. First, big content providers and regional eyeball networks actively use the IXPs’ RSes and peer openly, likely to reduce transit costs and latency. On the other hand, Tier-1s, which include major eyeball networks with a presence in Europe and overseas, peer more restrictively and often do not use the RS. Our findings about the selected players are summarized in Table 6 and show some unexpected yet important differences.

- **Content Providers (C1 and C2):** C1 exchanges most of its traffic via BL peerings but actively markets RS connectivity and maintains many ML peering sessions. C2, however, exchanges more than half of its traffic via ML peerings and shows an increasing tendency towards ML peerings over the last two years. Both providers openly advertise their prefixes to all members, with 100% and 99% of the traffic sent towards these members covered by the prefixes they advertise via the RS.
  
- **Online Social Networks (OSN1 and OSN2):** OSN1 only offers BL peering and is not present at the IXPs’ RS, likely to control its traffic flows. OSN2, on the other hand, only does ML peering at IXPs outside its home country, following a publicly announced policy to avoid BL BGP sessions wherever possible, likely to reduce administrative overhead.

- **Tier-1s (T1-1 and T1-2):** In contrast to the US, where Tier-1s typically do not use IXPs’ public switching fabrics, many Tier-1s connect at L-IXP, including T1-1 and T1-2. T1-1 does not use the RS at all at either IXP. T1-2 connects to the L-IXP RS but tags all its routes with the NO-EXPORT community, preventing them from being shared with other ASes.

These case studies highlight the diverse peering strategies employed by different types of ASes and provide insights into their motivations and operational practices.
