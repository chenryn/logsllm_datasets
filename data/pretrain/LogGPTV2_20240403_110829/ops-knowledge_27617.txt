User: I would like to know if there is any Linux distribution where you can easily install and use Python 3. This means a distribution that will provide not only Python 3 binaries and updates but also python modules.
I know that probably we are not going to see any python 3 as the default python interpretor so soon but at least I would like to see latest 2.x as default (2.6+) one and the alternative one already installed.
Probably it is a question between major distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora or Suse?
Assistant: All of them have the repositories, but if you care for one that has python3 as default, I only know of ArchLinux.
