Spearphishing Categories. As shown in Figure 5, the proportion
of active categories in spearphishing differs from common spam
significantly. For common spam, Gambling Phishing, an illegal ser-
vice that has developed into a mature underground industry in
China [67], accounts for the majority(48.90%), followed by Promo-
tional Spam(14.64%). However, Financial Scam (40.86%) is the most
active business of spearphishing, in which the attackers deceive
users by posing as reputable banks or financial companies and offer
loan services. Based on our dataset, 8 banks were found maliciously
disguised, including Bank of China and China Construction Bank.
One example is given in Table 4, in which the attackers disguised
as the Bank of China (BOC) claiming the victim met repayment

troubles while leaving a personal mobile phone (instead of the offi-
cial BOC hotline) as follow-up contacts. Besides, we also observed
6 loan apps sending spearphishing messages, claiming the loan was
overdue thereby scaring the victim into clicking on the malicious
shorten-URL (usually pointing to a phishing website) embedded in
the messages.
attackers would tend to target victims in less-developed areas, pos-
sibly because people in these areas are relatively less educated, thus
making it easier for scams to succeed.

5.2 Infrastructure
Distribution channels. We first focus on the channels through
which the attackers distribute spearphishing messages by examin-
ing the sender numbers. To better characterize the sender numbers,
we crawled a list of popular hotlines [12], area codes [19] and ISP
numbers [60] as the reference. Based on our dataset, a total of
26,129 sending numbers are observed, of which 13.97% came from
outside of China (possibly to reduce legal risks). Further inspection
of these overseas senders reveals that, the vast majority of them
were engaged in Gambling Phishing (72.78%) and mainly located
in the Philippines (44.06%). The remaining senders inside China
consist of three main sources: 106 SMS platforms (43.65%), cell-
phones (41.78%) and hotlines (0.61%). The 106 SMS platform is a
special case in China, which refers to the SMS gateway provided
by Chinese Internet Service Providers such as China Mobile [39]
and China Telecom [54], and enables bulk SMS sending functions
at low prices [37]. Messages sent from this platform would display
with a virtual sender number starting with “106”. Unfortunately, its
low-cost and easy-to-use nature has also attracted the attention of
underground industries. As reported in [45], in 2018, up to 92% of
the spam bulk messages were distributed from 106 platforms. Our
study further confirms that, the 106 SMS platform has also become
the “workhorse” of spearphishing SMS attacks. Besides, we find
that different spearphishing categories tend to use different sending
facilities. For example, over half of Gambling Phishing messages
come from foreign senders, while almost 80% of Financial Scams
utilize the 106 SMS platform.
Figure 7: Percentage of contacts used by category.
Compared with previous studies of common spam [48, 49, 73],
we observe that two new businesses are particularly active in
spearphishing SMS ecosystem, Fortune-telling (27.11%) and Law-
suit Scam (14.43%). Fortune-telling is a novel scam that has never
been discussed previously. Attackers usually claim that they can ac-
curately predict the fate of victims, and provide the details through
the embedded links. While as the example of this category shown
in Table 4, the links usually indeed pointing to phishing websites.
Lawsuit Scams are where the attackers claim that they would pros-
ecute the victims for violating some legal provision, to threaten
the victims into contacting them with left contacts, as the example
shown in Table 4. Although the fraudulent techniques of the above
two businesses are different, with Fortune-telling relying on luring
the victims and Lawsuit threatening them, in both scenarios, the
inclusion of victim’s personal information is always the crucial step
to make the scams more deceptive.
Sending Characteristics of Attackers. As mentioned in Sec-
tion 3, the logs we obtained contain the time and geolocation in-
formation of the victim receiving the SMS. Thus, we could study
the attackers’ message sending behavior by examining the spatio-
temporal distributions.
Based on the distribution of receiving time, we find the “working
patterns” of attackers differ across spearphishing categories. For
example, Financial Scam attackers tend to send messages inten-
sively during weekdays and working hours. The reason may be
that, Financial Scams are largely engaged in spoofing well-known
financial institutions such as banks. As these institutions usually
send messages during working time, attackers also mimic the same
working pattern to make the disguise more realistic. In contrast,
Fortune-telling Scam messages were mainly sent at night (over
87.67% were sent between 18:00 and 21:00). In this case, attackers
were essentially marketing fortune prediction services, so they tend
to operate at leisure time, leaving sufficient space for victims to
read the information and purchase services.
The geographical distribution of spearphishing victims is shown
in Figure 6, which is (not surprisingly) roughly proportional to the
regional population distribution [8]. In particular, Guangdong re-
ceives a significantly higher volume of spearphishing messages, the
vast majority of which are Gambling Phishing. This is determined
by its unique geo-location: Guangdong is adjacent to Macau, the
only region in China where gambling services are legal. Further-
more, although several less economically developed regions (e.g.,
Northwest China) received a lower absolute number of spearphish-
ing messages due to their smaller populations. If we calculate the
ratio of spearphishing to common spam in each region, i.e., the
“spearphishing rate”, their rankings are quite high. For example,
Tibet, which has the lowest GDP in China (in 2019 [42]), ranks
only 31/34 in the absolute number of spearphishing SMS received,
but has the highest spearphishing rate (0.41%). This suggests that

spearphishing messages from two or more campaigns, with the
most unfortunate one affected by up to 18 campaigns involving
businesses of Gambling Phishing, Social Scam and Promotional
Spam.
Out-of-band contacts. We also examined the contacts left in mes-
sages as the follow-up communication methods between spearphish-
ing attackers and victims. As shown in Table 2, URLs are the most
common ways, typically used to promote websites or distribute
malicious APKs. Attackers also leave phone numbers (Cellphone,
Hotline, Phone), or provide social accounts (QQ, WeChat) for follow-
up communication. Moreover, the nature of different spearphishing
businesses can affect the attacker’s propensity of contacts selection,
as shown in Figure 7. Employment Scam relies extensively on social
platforms to post recruitment tasks (see the example in Table 4),
thus they prefer to use QQ as the contacts, accounting for 94.93%.
WeChat is one of the most popular social platforms in China, and So-
cial Scam often deceives victims to add WeChat (87.92%) to perform
subsequent scam activities. In addition, since Lawsuit attackers
usually require human interactions to complete the scam, they are
more likely to take telephones (72.64%) as follow-up contacts.
5.3 Campaign Analysis
In order to gain deeper insights into SMS spear spamming activi-
ties, we further explore characteristics from a higher perspective,
i.e., by grouping the detected spearphishing messages into spam
campaigns. Specifically, we treat the messages embedded with the
same contact or from the same content template, while with
the Levenshtein Distance [71] less than 5, as being sent by the same
campaign. The threshold of Levenshtein Distance is an empirical
value referred to previous work [73]. And we conducted manual
inspections to confirm it could work effectively on our dataset as
well. A total of 11,475 campaigns were reported in this way. Ac-
tive properties and several interesting strategies of campaigns are
described as follows.
First, the scale of spearphishing campaigns exhibits a long-tail
distribution, with the top 100 campaigns accounting for 48.78% of all
spearphishing messages, and the top 1,000 campaigns accounting
for 73.19%. The largest campaign with 14,561 messages (16.04% of
all) is engaged in Fortune-telling Scams. Further inspection revealed
that this campaign was bursty in nature, with all messages sent
intensively during a 23-day period in March 2020. It is also the
most influential campaign, with a total of 9,667 impacted victim
devices spread across 34 provinces in China. As for the rest, 71
campaigns affected more than 50 victims, and the average number of
affected victims is 5 across all the campaigns. Further investigation
into the relationship between campaigns and the affected victims
revealed that, leaked personal information could be obtained by
multiple criminal groups, exposing the victims to a variety of scam
threats. Concretely, we found 3,155 devices (7.44% of all) received
We then investigate how different spearphishing categories are
distributed among campaigns and find that, the business of Finan-
cial Scam, Insurance Scam and Fortune-telling Scam all exhibit
oligopolistic characters, i.e., a few campaigns hold the majority
of the market share (i.e., the volume of spearphishing messages).
Specifically, the largest campaigns of Fortune-telling Scam and
Insurance Scam both hold more than 50% of their messages. For
Financial Scam, over 50% of the messages were split between cam-
paigns of the top 6. Furthermore, although 97.04% of campaigns
are engaged in only one type of spear scam, the few remaining
ones that undertake multiple categories present interesting busi-
ness models of spearphishing. Figure 8 shows that 11 of the top
one hundred campaigns engaged in more than one category. For
example, we found campaigns operating Financial Scam tend to
also conduct Lawsuit Scam (accounting for 2.96% of campaigns
engaging in multiple businesses). Further inspection of the mes-
sage content reveals that the Lawsuit messages actually appear as
follow-up tricks of Financial scams. We term this fraudulent model
as Semantic Progressiveness and would describe it in detail later.
We also measure the lifetime of a campaign by the number
of days to send spearphishing messages in this work. The aver-
age lifetime was 3 days for all campaigns and 31 days for the top
100. Interestingly, the lifespan also varies among different types of
spearphishing businesses. Lawsuit Scam and Gambling Phishing
campaigns have the longest average lifespan, at 7 days and 6 days
respectively. In contrast, Financial Scam campaigns survived the
shortest, with an average lifetime of 2 days. From the perspective
of evasion, the above phenomenon could be reasonable: Contacts
left in Financial Scam messages may be directly involved in mone-
tary transaction operations with victims, resulting in them being at
high-risk and subject to more frequent replacement. Therefore, as
we distinguish campaigns by embedded contacts, these campaigns
would present shorter lifetimes.
Furthermore, our exploration reveals several interesting strate-
gies of spearphishing attacks. To evade detection, they perform
test-sending on controlled devices and use multi-semantic text to
hide their true purpose. To attract victims, they construct phishing
content with global trending affairs and devise a chain of scams to
deceive victims. These strategies are described in detail as follows.
Strategy of spearphishing: test-sending. We observed an inter-
esting phenomenon, that one device (with a unique IMSI-IMEI)

continuously received 219 Lawsuit Scam spearphishing spam mes-
sages from the same campaign (see the example of Lawsuit Scam
in Table 4). The messages were templated, with only the Names
in the text changing (211 unique Names observed). Besides this
“abnormal” victim, the company also sent spearphishing messages
to several other “normal” victims (each received only one mes-
sage) using similarly templated content. After discussions with
telecom-fraud experts, we speculate that this is an interesting strat-
egy, test-sending operation, of spearphishing attackers. As both the
Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the client-side application may
implement fraud blocking features, spearphishing messages sent by
attackers may not reach the user’s inbox at all. Therefore, attackers
would check the “passing rate” by sending test messages to a device
under their control (as the “abnormal victim” we observed) and
then select the “passable messages” to spoof “normal victims” on a
large-scale, which is denoted as the test-sending strategy.
To understand the prevalence of this strategy in spearphish-
ing ecosystem, we systematically detect it across the entire dataset.
Campaigns with the following two characteristics would be screened
out: (1) At least one victim received multiple templated spearphish-
ing messages with different names as a testing device. (2) In addition
to the testing device, messages from similar templates were also sent
to multiple normal victims (each received messages with a unique
name). In this way, 4 campaigns employing the “test-sending” strat-
egy are identified, which totally sent 539 test messages and 9,062
formal spearphishing messages during the 3-month data-collection
period and affected 2,275 victims.
The above findings could provide new insights for defense, i.e., in
addition to detecting spearphishing messages based on text content
in real-time, we could also consider identifying test-sending opera-
tions of attackers (feasible for ISPs as they own the sender-receiver
relationship logs), which could be helpful to block spearphishing
attacks early in the test-sending phase.
Strategy of spearphishing: progressive deception. In addition
to the devices for test-sending mentioned above, we also find that
12,752 (52.11%) victims received multiple spearphishing messages
from one single campaign, with 192 of whom exhibiting another
interesting phenomenon: the received messages were from multiple
spearphishing categories with the content showing a semantic pro-
gression. For example, 122 victims first received pieces of Financial
Scam messages, in which they were recommended to subscribe
to loan service. Sometime later, we observed that all these victims
received Lawsuit Scam messages from the same campaign, claiming
