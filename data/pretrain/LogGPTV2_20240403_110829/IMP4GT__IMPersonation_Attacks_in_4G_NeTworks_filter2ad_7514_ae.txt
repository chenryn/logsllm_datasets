and thereby puts the provider’s business model at risk. For
example,
IMP4GT allows for draining the data volume or
accessing the service site with a victim’s identity. Providers
are required to analyze their risk for each case in which they
rely on user authentication.
Additionally, law enforcement agencies have an interest in
identifying the correct person during a prosecution. Lawful in-
terception is one requirement that allows targeted wiretapping.
Another method to identify a possible perpetrator of Internet
crime is to request the identity of a user for a particular public
IP address from the provider based on a lawful disclosure
request. With IMP4GT, an attacker can forge any trafﬁc to
the Internet. For example, an attacker can upload prosecution
relevant material with the identity of the victim to the Internet.
In those cases, the traces from an interception activity can show
anomalies such as repetitive UDP packets and a high amount
of ICMP packets. However, an attacker can imitate legitimate
trafﬁc by simulating DNS trafﬁc for the UDP connection and
normal ICMP echo/reply trafﬁc for the ICMP packets. When
the agency requests the identity solely from the public IP
address, any defects such as trafﬁc anomalies are missing.
In both cases, the law enforcement agencies cannot rely on
mutual authentication and need to consider the possibility of
a IMP4GT attack while investigating the case.
Users are affected by all points that apply for the provider
and law enforcement agencies. For example,
the provider
charges the user’s bank account when additional packages are
bought, or a law enforcement agency initiates an investigation
based on the false assumption of mutual authentication. In
those cases, the user has no means to prove his/her innocence.
Additionally, the downlink impersonation is an attack directed
against the user’s phone and can be a stepping stone for further
attacks. An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities of network
applications, e. g., IoT applications or the operating system. In
the light, of zero-day attacks discovered in the wild, IMP4GT
can be an additional stepping stone of such an attack. Our
attack shows that the user cannot rely on the provider’s ﬁrewall
and they need to harden their device.
B. Real-World Considerations
We have demonstrated the feasibility of the uplink and
downlink IMP4GT attack with an unmodiﬁed phone in a com-
mercial network. Nevertheless, the attack implementation in
its current form has limitations regarding stealth, performance,
and real-world applicability.
1) Stealth: In our experiments, we ﬁltered unwanted trafﬁc
at the relay by dropping packets with an unexpected length.
During the attack, we also terminate legitimate connections but
restore the regular Internet connectivity after the attack. Ad-
ditionally, we conduct the attack without any user interaction,
which makes it independent from an active usage of the phone.
Therefore, we need to consider two cases for reviewing the
stealth of the attack. If the victim is actively using the phone,
she/he will notice a short time of Internet connection loss. In
the case of accessing the local service site, the time of Internet
loss amounts to 4 sec, which is justiﬁable for the attack. With
some engineering effort, the ﬁltering can be improved such
that the Internet connection remains intact for the user. In
case the victim is idle, the loss of Internet connection remains
unnoticed.

2) Performance: The attack performance depends on the
reﬂection mechanism because it is one central component of
the attack. The only reﬂection that is limited is the unreachable
reﬂection. Because the uplink impersonation builds upon this
reﬂection, it has performance impairments. In particular, the
unreachable reﬂection limits the downlink decryption. We only
need to consider the limited length, as the reﬂection can be
triggered with full-rate due to the multi-peer mechanism (see
Section IV). We discuss the performance impairments due to
the length limitations of the unreachable reﬂection.
Android and iOS (IPv6 only) reﬂect only the minimum
MTU of the incoming packet, which restricts the length of the
to-be-decrypted packet. The attacker cannot directly limit the
downlink packet length sent by the target server. However, the
attacker can indirectly force the TCP implementation of the
target server to send shorter packets, i. e., by setting the TCP
window size to the minimum MTU for the TCP connection.
The disadvantage of this option is that each downlink TCP
packet needs to be acknowledged. In turn, this limits only the
throughput of the connection for the uplink impersonation.
Consequently, the uplink IMP4GT attack may not be suit-
able for low-latency and high data-rate applications, e. g., video
streaming, but sufﬁcient to access a website. The downlink
IMP4GT remains unaffected of any performance impairments
and can be used in full-rate to establish a connection to a UE.
3) Real-World Applicability: For our experiments, we use
a shielding box to prevent
interference with the licensed
spectrum and unwanted UEs with the relay. In a real-world
setting, the attacker needs to consider interference and multiple
UEs on all layers for building a relay. However, from the
UE’s perspective, such a relay attack is comparable to fake
base station attacks, which are already conducted in the real-
world [41], [35]. Nevertheless, we need to consider an attacker
with strong domain knowledge along with several resources to
implement such a MitM relay and carry out the IMP4GT attack.
Despite all limitations, we demonstrate the feasibility of the
IMP4GT attack in a commercial network with an unmodiﬁed
UE. Thus, it represents a threat for all users and stakeholders
that rely on mutual authentication in LTE.
C. Potential Countermeasures
IMP4GT exploits the speciﬁcation ﬂaw of missing integrity
protection along with the RFC conform reﬂection behavior of
the IP stack. We ﬁrst discuss possible mitigations on the higher
layers. Then we discuss the opportunity of mitigation in the IP
stack, but will argue that the only sustainable countermeasure
is mandatory integrity protection.
One possibility is to protect against the initial DNS spoof-
ing attack with DNSSec, DNS over TLS, or DNS over HTTPs.
However, IMP4GT does not necessarily need the initial DNS
spooﬁng attack. As soon as the attacker knows the IP address
of an outgoing TCP connection, she can directly redirect the
TCP connection with the ALTER attack and, thus, hijack the
connection for continuing the preparation phase of IMP4GT.
An example of outgoing TCP connections are the connections
of the email client that connects periodically to pre-known
IP addresses. Another possibility would be to secure all
TCP connection with TLS such that the client can detect a
redirection based on mismatching certiﬁcates. However, the
TCP proxy transparently relays the TLS connections, and thus
the redirection remains undetected. Also, a VPN connection
has only limited mitigation properties as not all connections
can use the VPN connection and are therefore protected. For
example, the connectivity check of Android connects to a
service before the OS notiﬁes other applications about the
Internet, such as VPN applications. Those connections remain
attackable by IMP4GT.
One mitigation is to disable the IP reﬂection mechanism
at the UE, as IMP4GT relies on it. However, any modiﬁcation
would invalidate the RFC conformity of the IP stack and harm
interoperability. For example, the ICMP echo request (ping) is
often used to check if the device is reachable and disabling the
echo responses would break the ping protocol. Consequently, it
would be impossible to check if the device is reachable on the
IP layer. Thus, any modiﬁcation of the IP stack might work,
but comes at the cost of interoperability.
The main reason for IMP4GT is the lack of integrity
protection and thus the possibility of user data manipula-
tion. Mandatory integrity protection was neglected due to
the additional overhead on the radio layer. The retrospective
speciﬁcation and deployment of integrity protection in LTE
requires ﬁnancial and logistic efforts, as all UEs and eNodeBs
must be updated to be secured against IMP4GT. Despite these
efforts, this paper should be read as a reminder of the urgency
for mandatory integrity protection on the user plane in LTE.
D. Integrity Protection in 5G
While LTE is already used for nearly a decade, the cur-
rently deployed 5G speciﬁcation comes with different states
regarding user-plane integrity protection. We discuss the state
of integrity protection for the two deployment phases.
Non-standalone (NSA) with dual connectivity is the ﬁrst
phase, in which the phone connects via 4G for all control
data, but uses 5G for user data. The 3GPP 5G Security
working group stated: “Although integrity protection for UP
data is supported in 5G networks, it will not be used in dual
connectivity case.” [7]. Thus, the early 5G deployments cannot
prevent IMP4GT attacks.
The second phase will be the standalone (SA) phase, in
which the UE has a control connection to the 5G core network
along with the 5G radio layer. At the time of publication,
this phase was still under development; its current state is as
follows: First, user-data integrity protection is optional to use
and the provider can decide to enable it. Second, the phone
can implement integrity protection within full-rate or only
up to 64 kbit/s, whereas only the latter option is demanded
in the speciﬁcation. Most data connections exceed this data
rate, as 5G promises high data rates up to 20 Gbit/s and,
thus, the user-plane integrity protection cannot be applied [14].
Obviously,
the requirement for high-data rates contradicts
the requirement for security and the attack vector remains
exploitable in 5G [4], [5]. We emphasize the requirement
for a mandatory and full-rate integrity protection for all
5G data connections to prevent IMP4GT.

E. Disclosure Process
We have informed providers and vendors about the attacks
through the GSMA CVD process [18]. The GSMA notiﬁed
the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) with a liaison
statement [19]. In response, the 3GPP RAN group has con-
ﬁrmed that LTE speciﬁcations do not support any integrity
protection. For 5G, the 3GPP RAN group points out that
integrity protection up to 64 kbit/s is mandatory to support
but optional
to conﬁgure [3], which provides insufﬁcient
protection. However, we hope that our ﬁndings emphasize the
demand for a mandatory and full-rate integrity protection.
F. Ethical Considerations
At all time, we ensured that no real-world users were
harmed during the commercial network experiments. We used
a shielding box that prevents nearby users from connecting
to our relay. Furthermore, the relay’s UE component conforms
the speciﬁcation, which ensured a correct behavior towards the
commercial network in the up- and downlink.
VII. RELATED WORK
In the following, we discuss related work in the context of
mobile networks with a focus on the security of LTE.
The ALTER attack relies on the same weaknesses and
attacker model as IMP4GT, but it follows different attack aims.
The ALTER attack aims to redirect DNS requests and leads a
victim to a malicious website. In contrast, the IMP4GT attacks
aim to impersonate one of the communication partners and
thereby break the mutual authentication for the user plane.
Until now, impersonation attacks in LTE only exploited
implementation ﬂaws or misconﬁguration. Examples of such
ﬂaws are the work by Rupprecht et al. [39], where the authors
demonstrated that a UE accepts null security algorithms due
to misimplementation. Chlosta et al. [9] found similar issues
in the conﬁguration of commercial networks. Both cases allow
an impersonation of the respective communication partner, but
are ﬁxable with a ﬁrmware or conﬁguration update. In contrast,
IMP4GT exploits a speciﬁcation ﬂaw and the requirements of
the IP stacks, which are only ﬁxable by a speciﬁcation change.
The IMP4GT attacks do not break the mutual authentication
that is established during the AKA. Previous work analyzed the
AKA on different security properties. Alt et al. [6] prove the
security of the LTE AKA against a MitM attacker by formal
cryptographic analysis. Basin et al. and Cremers et al. [10],
[8] analyze the 5G AKA that is similar to the LTE AKA
using the protocol veriﬁcation tool Tamarin. While these prior
approaches focus on the AKA security itself in the presence
of pre-deﬁned attacker models, our work targets the user plane
security mechanisms following the AKA that aim for mutual
authentication.
For the presented IMP4GT attack, we exploited missing in-
tegrity protection which is a speciﬁcation ﬂaw. So far, previous
studies found vulnerabilities in the speciﬁcation ranging from
privacy to denial of service attacks [38]. Privacy attacks can
localize and track a user [43], [25], [44] or infer the visiting
websites [30], [28]. Further, attacks can exploit protocol vul-
nerabilities of the phone [43], [24] or exhaust resources [46]
for a denial of service. A special kind of denial of service are
jamming attacks that disturb the physical communication [27],
[31], [16]. Hussain et al. [24] present an authentication relay
attack that allows eavesdropping on un-encrypted trafﬁc. The
attacks mentioned above exploit speciﬁcation ﬂaws of control
trafﬁc. For our analysis, we do not solely focus on speciﬁcation
ﬂaws but consider the cross-layer interactions on the user
plane. Besides speciﬁcation ﬂaws, LTE implementations offer
a wide attack surface. Therefore, one building block of LTE
security is the correct implementation and, hence, is target to
different analysis methodologies. Kim et al. [29] introduce a
semi-automatic tool for analyzing the behavior of equipment
with the input of malicious data. By doing so, they discover
vulnerabilities, including SMS spooﬁng attacks or an AKA
bypass allowing to eavesdrop data sessions. Fang et al. [15]
analyze the implementation security of mobile basebands per-
muting the input with the support of reinforcement learning.
Hong et al. [23], [22] passively analyze the reallocation behav-
ior of temporary identiﬁers and found that the reallocation is
not sufﬁciently random, which allows the tracking of users. In
our analysis, we focus on the cross-layer speciﬁcation issues
rather than the implementation security.
the control
For conducting the IMP4GT attack, the relay emulates a
fake base station on layer two. Normally, fake base stations
in LTE exploit
trafﬁc sent before the security
establishment and allow to track or localize a victim. Previous
work targets the detection of fake base stations
[12], [33],
[11], [34], [42]. By looking for malicious control trafﬁc, e. g.,
identity requests, the probability of an attack is calculated. In
our work, we utilize a relay that acts as a fake base station
that does not depend on the modiﬁcation of control trafﬁc.
Consequently, the relay can be integrated into the commercial
network without being recognized and, thus, circumvents exist-
ing detection methods. Recently, Hussain et al. [37] proposed
a prevention mechanism against fake base stations based on a
public key scheme together with distance bounding, allowing
the detection of relayed control trafﬁc. Our relay forwards con-
trol trafﬁc and such mechanism can prevent it if speciﬁed and
correctly implemented. In the context of the IPsec protocol,
