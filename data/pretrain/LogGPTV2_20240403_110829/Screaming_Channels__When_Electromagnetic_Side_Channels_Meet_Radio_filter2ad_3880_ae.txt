comes from an oscillator or digital clock signal on a device, while a
screaming channel will use the carrier wave created by a frequency
synthesizer in an RF transmitter.
8.2 Modern tools and applications
Besides discovering and exploiting side-channels, methods for tar-
geting collection parameters and inferring processor state infor-
mation have also become more sophisticated in recent years. This
includes highlighting the most promising sources of unintentional
emanations [15], measuring the power consumption of individual
instructions [52], measuring an attacker’s advantage when an in-
struction is changed in a program [14], and modeling the range of
viability for EM side-channel attacks [55].
Remote device fingerprinting based on intercepted signals in-
clude measuring artifacts such as modulation errors [17], seed
sequences [53], and characteristic defects in the manufacturing
process that are expressed in a device’s modulated signal [16]. It
has also been suggested as a way to profile a program’s perfor-
mance [13, 50] or detect anomalies in program execution [36] (such
as malware injection).
Software provided by GNURadio [9], rsa-sdr [11], and the Chip-
Whisperer project [40] have simplified the tasks of trace collection
and analysis, and in some cases inspired the trace processing code
written for this study.
8.3 Noise in mixed-signal designs
A lot of work has been dedicated to observing and explaining the
various interactions in electronic circuits that lead to inadvertent
signal emission in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) [6, 18, 28, 43].
Much of this research, however, is targeted at aiding circuit design
with respect to EM compliance; security is never considered focus.
The challenges and countermeasures of mixed-signal IC design
are conceptually similar to PCB design. Bronckers et al. [12] per-
formed a detailed study of substrate noise coupling mechanisms
in SoCs that incorporated digital and analog components. Their
work demonstrated that the extent of undesirable noise in ICs is
highly dependent on layout, and provided recommendations for
how designers could effectively use guard rings and other isolation
structures to properly shield analog components.
9 CONCLUSIONS
Unintentional EM leaks have plagued designers and users of secure
systems since they were discovered. In this paper, we introduce and
analyze a novel side channel on mixed-signal chips, where EM leaks
from digital circuits propagate to nearby analog radio components
and, as a result, are broadcast in the air along with the intended
radio communications. We demonstrated full key recovery against
popular AES implementations over such “screaming channels“ for
distances up to 10 m for tinyAES and 1 m for mbedTLS using novel
TRA and CRA attacks.
We believe that our attack requires to re-think the way in which
mixed-signal chips, or cryptographic implementations for them,
are designed. Hence, besides showing the attack, we also propose
several directions for countermeasures in the hope to allow better
protection for affected devices in the future.
12
While those attacks are on specific Bluetooth chips, the fact that
the effects involved are very generic implies that it is likely that
“screaming channels” affect many systems which process sensitive
data and include a radio transmitter. Future work will therefore
have to discover which other systems are affected.
CODE AVAILABILITY
All code required to replicate our attack is available at http://s3.
eurecom.fr/tools/screaming_channels/, together with the data we
have collected and a precise description of the hardware setup.
