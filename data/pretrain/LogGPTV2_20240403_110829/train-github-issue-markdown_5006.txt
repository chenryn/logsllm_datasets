When an accordion container is closed, its contents are still visible in IE.
I checked IE9, IE8 and IE7. Fails in all of them. It was a real IE9 running on
Windows 7, IE8 and IE7 were the IE9 running in the emulation modes.
The accordion example at
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#collapse works as test
case.
