User: I am getting an error

unicodedecodeerror 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 1
  ordinal not in range(128)

while performing the below mentioned operation.
I have a program that reads files from remote machine(Ubuntu) using grep and cat command for the same to fetch values and stores the value in a variable via robot framework builtin keyword export command from client.
Following are the versions i am using:-
Robot Framework: 2.8.11
Ride: 0.55
Putty: 0.63
Pyhton: 2.7.3
I am doing a SSH session on Linux machine and on that machine their is a file in which the data is having accented characters for eg: Õ Ü Ô Ý .
While reading the text from the file containing accented characters using 'grep' and 'cat' command i am facing this issue.

unicodedecodeerror 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 1
  ordinal not in range(128)

Thank you.
Assistant: I think the problem is that the file contains UTF-8, not ASCII.  Robot Framework appears to be expecting ASCII text.  ASCII text only contains values in the range 0-127, when the ascii codec sees a byte 0xC3 it throws an error.  (If the text was using the Western European Windows 8-bit encoding, 0xC3 would be Ã.  If it was using the MacOS encoding, 0xC3 would be ∑.  In fact, it is the first of two bytes which define a single character in the range of most of the interesting accented characters.)
Somehow, you need to teach Robot Framework to use the correct encoding.
