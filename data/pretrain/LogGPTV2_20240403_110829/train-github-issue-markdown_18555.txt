**Previous Behavior**  
In version 1.0.0.beta31, you could put anything inside a `` component
and it would get faded.
**Current Behavior**  
As of version 1.0.0.beta32, it seems that `Fade` relies on the child component
doing the right thing with the `style` prop.
Here's a CodeSandbox example:

I am not sure if this is intended behavior or not, but the change caught me
off guard and I figured I should mention it.
