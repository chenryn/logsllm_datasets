### Problem Description
Electron apps are increasing exponentially. Nowadays we have to use multiple
electron app instances in the same computer.  
But every single app instance runs a separate instance of Chromium/ElectronJS
which uses more resources, which is bad for performance.
### Proposed Solution
Since, multiple apps are already using Chromium/ElectronJS, if there was a way
to make them share the same instance of Chromium/ElectronJS, kind of like
multiple Tabs/Windows in a browser, that would make ElectronJS apps faster,
less resource hungry, and so on.
### Alternatives Considered
I have searched for some alternatives but haven't found any yet
### Additional Information
Or if there's an App made by the official team of ElectronJS that scans all
the ElectronJS apps installed in the system and puts them into the same
ElectronJS folder/instance to share resources, should be good too.
Thanks
