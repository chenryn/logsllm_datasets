Create two roles, for instance "nginx" and "tomcat"; define variable files in
each role with a 'version' variable, set to match expected versions of nginx
and tomcat; create a playbook which associates both 'nginx' and 'tomcat' roles
to a set of hosts.
Depending on order of execution, it appears that ansible overwrites the
tomcat:version property with the nginx:version property, and then attempts to
install tomcat-{{nginx:version}} which fails.
Either documentation should be updated to reflect the idea that roles maintain
variables in a global namespace, or roles should be updated to auto-namespace
vars files inside them, such that similarly named vars can co-exist between
roles.
