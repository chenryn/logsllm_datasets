Variable Parameters for Application Activity XA Operations
XA operations are API calls that applications can make to enable MQ to participate in a transaction. The
parameters for each operation are defined in the following section.
The trace level indicates the level of trace granularity that is required for the parameters to be included in
the trace. The possible trace level values are:
1.Low
The parameter is included when "low", "medium" or "high" activity tracing is configured for an
application. This setting means that a parameter is always included in the AppActivityData group
for the operation. This set of parameters is sufficient to trace the MQI calls an application makes, and
to see if they are successful.
2.Medium
The parameter is only included in the AppActivityData group for the operation when "medium" or
"high" activity tracing is configured for an application. This set of parameters adds information about
the resources, for example, queue and topic names used by the application.
3.High
The parameter is only included in the AppActivityData group for the operation when "high"
activity tracing is configured for an application. This set of parameters includes memory dumps of
the structures passed to the MQI and XA functions. For this reason, it contains more information about
the parameters used in MQI and XA calls. The structure memory dumps are shallow copies of the
structures. To avoid erroneous attempts to dereference pointers, the pointer values in the structures
are set to NULL.
Note: The version of the structure that is dumped is not necessarily identical to the version used by
an application. The structure can be modified by an API crossing exit, by the activity trace code, or by
the queue manager. A queue manager can modify a structure to a later version, but the queue manager
never changes it to an earlier version of the structure. To do so, would risk losing data.
