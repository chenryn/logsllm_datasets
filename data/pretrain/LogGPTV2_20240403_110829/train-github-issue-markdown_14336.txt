Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

---

I have the following example of a string literal type in TypeScript:
```typescript
type TStyles = 'x' | 'y' | 'z';
```

Using IntelliSense for code completion, I would like to achieve the following:
```typescript
var style: TStyles = '>>> I want to use [CTRL+J] here to offer only valid TStyles values <<<';
```

With this setup, when I press [CTRL+J], IntelliSense should provide a list of only the valid `TStyles` values ('x', 'y', 'z').

This version is clearer, more structured, and maintains a professional tone.
