User: I am in the process of building a Google App Engine application which requires audio to be recorded and saved in our database. I have found no alternative to using some form of RTMP server for recording audio through flash, so [rtmplite] (http://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/) came into our horizon.
Since I have no experience with rtmplite, is it the right choice for our project? Or is there any other Python-based RTMP solution that allows audio recording? Any flash client you can recommend?
Thanks!
Assistant: Google App Engine is tricky for RTMP because it does not support sockets. You would have to use something like RTMPT which is tunneled over HTTP, however, this tunneling incurs latency so if you are looking to do anything realtime this could become an issue.
Currently rtmplite does not support RTMPT so this would not be possible at the moment. I am involved in a project, RTMPy (http://rtmpy.org), that is planning support for RTMPT and AppEngine. Unfortunately AppEngine support is probably a few months out.
