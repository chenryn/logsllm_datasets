I am currently developing a Google App Engine (GAE) application that requires the capability to record and store audio in our database. After some research, I found that using an RTMP server might be the only viable option for recording audio through Flash. Consequently, I came across [rtmplite](http://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/).

Since I have no prior experience with rtmplite, I would like to know if it is the right choice for my project. Are there any other Python-based RTMP solutions that support audio recording? Additionally, could you recommend a suitable Flash client for this purpose?

Thank you for your question. It's important to note that Google App Engine can be challenging when it comes to implementing RTMP, as it does not natively support sockets. Instead, you would need to use RTMPT, which tunnels RTMP over HTTP. However, this tunneling introduces additional latency, which may not be ideal if real-time performance is critical for your application.

Currently, rtmplite does not support RTMPT, making it unsuitable for your needs at the moment. I am part of a project called RTMPy (http://rtmpy.org), which is planning to add support for RTMPT and GAE. Unfortunately, the integration with App Engine is still a few months away from completion.

In the meantime, you may want to explore other alternatives or consider using a different hosting environment that supports RTMP more directly. If you have any further questions or need more specific recommendations, feel free to ask.
