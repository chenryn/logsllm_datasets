been hosting43, have made us even more conscious 
about the importance that people-powered public 
services are assuming and the related shift of political 
paradigm they are contributing at.
Our project gave us some answers but most of all 
raised new questions. The first one is about continuity. 
93
2.3 CONTINUITY 
It is tempting to be satisfied quickly by the 
enthusiastic reaction of the moment. However, one 
must remind oneself that the aftercare of a project 
is key to its success. As such, within the Saint-Gilles 
case we decided to continue the project for one more 
year with a smaller - and as such, more manageable 
- group of students44 so that we could follow through 
on and support the development of the micro-projects 
that have already been “selected” by the citizens 
themselves somehow. This is one way to give a sign of 
continuity, of shaping the handover phase and support 
the local community, of not letting things die out 
immediately after only the first steps have been taken. 
As we could experience in similar projects before, the 
gap between first enthusiasm and really getting things 
done is generally difficult to bridge for inhabitants 
once the design-team - in this case the design schools 
- disappear from the picture. 
The aftercare of a project ought to be considered an 
actual step in the design process, one in which design 
students take care that the micro-projects they came 
up with together with the community, are also adopted 
by that community. In order to facilitate this process 
of building a sense of (co-)ownership in this phase, 
students need to be present in a slightly more discrete 
fashion, more in the background so to say. They need 
to be ready to step aside and eventually step back into 
the process when needed. 
The participating schools, with the experience they 
have been gaining throughout the past years of 
working in the field and with the freedom they are 
granted to experiment, play a key role in recognizing, 
promoting and supporting what is needed by the local 
community throughout the different steps of a project. 
As such, schools can be said to be well-positioned to 
take on small-scale but nevertheless profound societal 
challenges.
Nowadays, they are often the ones to start up new 
initiatives and eventually look for some financial 
support, in dialogue with the public authorities. It 
are also often the design schools, because of the 
experience they gain in the field, which point out the 
importance of aftercare of projects, which is something 
often not foreseen or thought of enough by local 
partners and authorities.45 
Another element required in order to guarantee 
continuity, is the active involvement of “local heroes”, 
enthusiastic, motivated and pro-active people willing 
to take ideas and initiatives a step further. During the 
last months of the Welcome to Saint-Gilles project, the 
coordinating team has been working to identify these 
local heroes, since we are aware of their importance 
to the success of the project. Besides identifying the 
local heroes, we also decided to map some of the 
local places which could be employed/transformed 
for inhabitants to come together, discuss and work 
together. In the Saint-Gilles case, we found the place 
and our local hero together.46 
He turned out to be a civil servant, responsible for 
the Botanical Garden of Saint-Gilles. He currently 
oversees and manages the space where the “street 
movement” meets, i.e. one of the underused spaces of 
the Botanical Gardens. The location had already been 
envisaged as a place for the neighborhood to meet, 
discuss and work together on its improvement. Hence, 
the will was there as well as the resources. What the 
schools did was to create the momentum for these 
elements to find one another and merge. The place 
was not granted by policy makers, but by a civil servant 
who saw potential in the initiative and was open to 
welcome the initiative under the umbrella of a pre-
existing one.
In July this year, the schools will leave. But before that, 
we are creating toolkits for the street committee to 
facilitate their dialogue, to introduce new ideas, share 
their tools and knowledge, and so on. We are basically 
supporting them with design skills, empowering them 
to become the “(co)designers” of their process. We are 
confident that the initiative can and most likely will 
continue, since it has now become “their” initiative, of 
the local inhabitants: they became a street committee, 
they developed their own magazine, their own 
initiatives, they have their own place where to meet, 
someone from the public sector who is professionally 
dedicated to the initiative. In a nutshell, they could 
cut the umbilical cord. Even though it will take some 
time to evaluate the project, we have the feeling that 
somehow we have achieved one of our main goals: 
the local community has managed to establish itself 
as a first local hub in the game of social innovation, 
materializing on the new dynamics created by the 
school-driven project.
Also local (and other) public authorities are currently 
noticing the new dynamics brought about by the project 
in the neighborhood and start to be hungry for more. 
2.4 A local touchpoint
Enabling people to co-design and co-produce 
people-powered public services can be regarded a 
meta-service in its own right. Just like every service 
to be designed, as such, it would require processes 
and touchpoints. During the project it soon became 
clear that infrastructure would be needed to render it 
possible for the local community to gather around the 
initiative, and allow them to interact with designers or 
design students when needed. The physical working 
space that has been found for the meetings of the 
street movement forms the physical touchpoint of what 
can be called a PIP 47. A PIP or Public Innovation Place, 
is a term which came to be used within the Public 
& Collaborative Cluster, to denote places for public 
innovation where citizens and public sector staff come 
and work together to create solutions which enable 
positive social change. In the case of Saint-Gilles, the 
location of which we speak is a beautiful, abandoned, 
art-deco building. Its character could undoubtedly 
enhance its function as a community center where to 
design, sow and grow seeds of social innovation. 
The community itself has been growing and continues 
to do so. At the first meeting of the street movement, 
when the location was not identified yet, more than 
50 people showed up. One could read in this a sign 
of support for the initiative. 50 people in a relatively 
small neighborhood coming together on a positive, 
constructive note around joint issues, also attracted the 
attention of other stakeholders such as civil servants 
and local policy makers to look for ways to tap into this 
energy and make use of the momentum generated.
The creation of a PIP generally benefits from starting 
in a bottom-up way, from the local community itself, 
yet facilitated by a third party - e.g. designers or design 
schools in our case - to help them express their needs 
and challenges, and transform their dynamics towards 
co-designing and co-producing solutions. When the 
need for public infrastructure arises, the public sector 
can be a strong enabler however in seeking and/or 
providing the right location.48 Many times however, 
there are already empty or underused public spaces 
and pre-existing resources that can thus find a new 
context and purpose of use. 
94
Furthermore, having worked first on weaving the 
community tissue and building capacity within the 
neighborhood of Saint-Gilles and then on the location 
has been advantageous to the process as it put people 
first. Hence it has been the community adopting their 
space on the basis of shared goals and needs, not the 
other way around. To put it in a simple metaphor: a 
community can grow a garden, but it is rather difficult 
to care for a garden without having a local community. 
Shaping and dealing with these preconditions, is part 
of the co-design process of the PIP and the services it 
will roll out.
In terms of the exhibition organized to celebrate 
the outcomes of the initial “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” 
project and the community of stakeholders who made it 
possible together, could also be regarded a touchpoint 
in the meta-service role of the PIP. It provided a 
venue and carefully crafted experience for the local 
community to engage with the project results to which 
they contributed, with the designers and design schools 
and as such also with each other to co-decide how to 
take the ideas further and implement them. 
“Enabling people to  
co-design and co-produce 
people-powered public 
services can be regarded a 
meta-service in its  
own right.”
A similar way to achieve this could be to organize a so-
called market of ideas. Within the context of a previous 
project “Design for togetherness” in Genk (B)49, the 
authors coached students to dress up an improvised 
booth during an evening market in the neighborhood 
in order to allow local community members to 
interact with prototypes, gather feedback from them 
to improve upon ideas etc. Other ways include digital 
spaces, online platforms for social innovation50, a 
public office, a street party, an sms’ street service, 
a design biennial or event embedded in the local 
community. Essentially, anything which stimulates and 
supports active communication and facilitates physical 
gathering and action, can help to physically ground 
neighborhood dynamics and initiative.
95
A stable ‘base-station’ - recognizable and accessible 
to all sharing the will and idea of improving their 
neighborhood, as a shared common good - takes such 
temporary initiatives one step further. 
3. PIP
3.1 Public Innovation Places & Design Schools
Public Innovation Places (PIP) can be considered 
enabling platforms where citizens, civil servants and 
policy makers can co-design sustainable solutions 
for societal challenges. The design schools, because 
of the freedom they are granted to research and 
experiment with new ways for design to be meaningful 
to society, have the possibility to work as a laboratory 
for social innovation and as such facilitate this kind of 
initiatives. This is basically one of the reasons why we 
started a DESIS lab within our research group Social 
Spaces CUO51, so that we could explore new modes of 
interaction between design and society in a sustainable 
way. This is a core value shared with the research group 
as such. From an educational and academic perspective, 
the lab’s activities allow to learn from the collaboration 
with other schools and from sharing experiences, 
how to better shape new interfaces and modes of 
interaction between design, design schools and society. 
As activities take place in a real-life context, they also 
nudge school projects and students to leave behind (at 
least some of) the naiveties commonly associated with 
them and step up the quality of work even thought it 
has a pioneering character.
PIPs can find support in design schools in various 
ways. As mentioned earlier, because of their freedom 
of action and ‘non-profit’ nature, schools often take on 
the role of initiator of projects, there where economic 
realities. As such they also prepare the ground for 
other players to enter the game and continue on the 
basis of their work. They can also offer a context for 
others to experiment and learn, e.g. local inhabitants, 
civil servants and policymakers become familiar with 
design for social innovation, its power, requirements 
and limitations. Involving design students also brings 
in an element of mixing generations of working across 
the young/old divide and hence improve mutual 
understanding and value. 
In the case of Welcome to Saint-Gilles the small 
PIP that just took off - in a bottom up way - has the 
potential to become a valuable catalyst of local 
initiative and a valuable medium in supporting the 
aftercare of the project. This will hopefully help 
to empower the inhabitants of the neighborhood 
to incrementally improve their quality of life and 
eventually reduce the sense of fatalism connected to 
the fact of always waiting for solutions to ‘descend 
from the heavens’, e.g.  in a top-down way. While 
several valuable ingredients to a PIP have been 
identified through the course of this and other similar 
projects, what makes certain recipes work and others 
fail, requires further experimentation, research and 
debate.
This is why the authors decided to study the nature 
of PIPs in a little more detail within the context of a 
course at the MAD Faculty this year, together with P&C 
partner institution: Parsons NY, The New School for 
Design.52 
In the next sections we will take a slightly more 
reflective look at PIPs through the lense of philosophy.
3.2 Freedom to experiment
The freedom to experiment is a key characteristic 
of PIPs. They provide people - across boundaries of 
disciplines or backgrounds, yet with common interests 
- with the space and freedom to explore new modes 
of interaction within society, one in which exceptions 
are welcomed. They are places where various options 
are explored in parallel to one another. Showcases - 
collections of innovative concepts and initiatives with 
a unique touch to it - are built as inspiration for others 
to adopt or built further upon and diverse expressions 
of shared (added) values.
When one looks at our cultural history, several other 
such contexts of free experimentation and expression 
come to mind. One such example is the rarity cabinet, 
or rather “Wunderkammer”.53
The Wunderkammer was a physical space where to 
collect different elements of reality, from the mineral, 
organic world but also from archeology, historical 
artifacts, artworks; in short, everything that was 
considered to be eccentric, beyond the everyday 
mainstream. The Wunderkammer was a “theatrum 
mundi”54, a heir to Guilio Camillo’s “Cabinet of the 
World”55, where the way in which the different objects 
- naturalia and artificialia56 - were presented, embedded 
in a sort of narrative, i.e. the story of the personal 
philosophy or “Weltanschauung” of the cabinet’s 
owner. The freedom to contextualize, creating personal 
collections on the basis of new connections represented 
a relevant change in the history of the Renaissance. 
Michel Foucault described the Wunderkammer’s 
mindset, which characterized the Renaissance’s 
“episteme”57, as that which allows true discovery and 
embodies the spirit of exploratory research. 
The Wunderkammer can be a metaphorical source of 
inspiration when addressing the topic of PIPs. That 
what appears to be the exception to today’s society 
finds in it a place to be nurtured and grown, so that it 
can become a kind of small-scale model, a seed for a 
new way of organizing or running society, an exception, 
a “rarity”, which could hence possibly finds its way into 
the mainstream in a near future.58
In this sense - returning to Foucault - one could also 
see PIPs as “heterotopias”, literally “other places” 
or “places of otherness”, alternatives to the ones 
imposed by the actual state of things, the predominant 
paradigm of thought, in this case that of top-down 
organized, often consumption-driven and individual-
oriented society.59 
3.3 PIP as places of exception
PIPs can be regarded as a kind of in-between spaces 
in which exceptions, alternatives to today’s market 
driven society are grown, in which people experiment 
with the preconditions for a new societal paradigm 
- participative, open, a-hierarchical. The exceptions to 
the current way of deciding upon the res publica which 
PIPs embody, could hence show new ways forward and 
possibly even become or introduce new rules. 
The idea of the exception as grounding the rule 
is something which we inherited from the notion 
of “state of exception” (“Ausnahmezustand”) in 
the philosophy of both Carl Schmitt60 and Walter 
Benjamin61. Both authors emphasize the way in which 
it is the exception that determines political action. The 
inside and the outside do not exclude each other, yet 
they determine each other.
In contemporary philosophy, the Italian philosopher 
Giorgio Agamben62 elaborates further upon this notion. 
According to him, since Roman Law, the establishment 
of the rule was based on the exception to the rule, 
namely the figure of the Homo Sacer, a man - both 
sacred and damned  at the same time - who was 
considered to be outside of law and, as such, could 
96
be killed by anybody without any legal repercussion. 
According to Agamben, it is this figure which delineates 
and thereby grounds Roman Law. In this respect, that 
which grounds the law does so from outside of it. 
Again, the established state of things - the rule - is 
grounded by what is outside of it, namely the exception. 
its practitioners and contexts of operations in which 
they are active, would benefit from a closer analysis of 
the consequences - both positive and negative - of its
