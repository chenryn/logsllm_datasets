### Web Browser Exploitation with BeEF
**BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)** is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser. Amid growing concerns about web-borne attacks against clients, including mobile clients, BeEF allows professional penetration testers to assess the actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened network perimeter and client system and examines exploitability within the context of the one open door: the web browser.

BeEF hooks one or more web browsers and uses them as bases for launching directed command modules and further attacks against the system from within the browser context. The BeEF framework generates a one-line JavaScript code that, when inserted into a website, will hook the website visitors and create a connection between the visitor's web browser and the BeEF server. This allows the attacker to run commands on the visitor's machine.

#### BeEF Installation in Kali Linux
- **Preinstalled Versions**: BeEF comes preinstalled in older Kali versions (2019.2 and older). If you are running one of these versions, no additional installation is required.
- **Newer Versions**: In mid-2019, Kali removed BeEF as a preinstalled exploitation tool, moving it from "kali-linux-default" to the "kali-linux-large" metapackage. If you have a fresh version of Kali Linux, you will need to install BeEF manually.

### Exercise 42: Browser Exploitation with BeEF
In this exercise, we will use BeEF to hook and control users who access the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) website, which is part of the Metasploitable virtual machine. We will add the BeEF script to a stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability. The BeEF hook will allow us to perform various tasks on the victim's machine, such as tricking the user into entering Facebook credentials, thinking they are relogging into Facebook, and many other commands.

#### Real-Life Scenario
In a real-life scenario, hackers might send a phishing email containing a link to a website. The hacker either exploits an existing XSS vulnerability or designs a website with a BeEF hook embedded in a JavaScript file.

#### Steps:
1. **Start Metasploitable Virtual Machine** in VirtualBox.
2. **Log in to Metasploitable** as `msfadmin/msfadmin`.
3. **Check IP Address**: Use `ifconfig` to find the IP address.
4. **Open Kali and Web Browser**: Go to the DVWA page in the Metasploitable VM.
5. **Reset Database**: Click on Setup, then Create/Reset Database.
6. **XSS Stored**: Click on XSS Stored.
7. **Start BeEF**: In Kali, search for BeEF and start it. Log in as `beef/beef`.

#### Manual BeEF Installation in Kali 2020.1
1. **Clone BeEF Repository**:
   ```bash
   sudo git clone https://github.com/beefproject/beef.git
   cd /opt/beef
   ```
2. **Install BeEF**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install
   ```
3. **Edit Configuration**:
   - Switch to root: `sudo su`
   - Edit `config.yaml` using a text editor like `mousepad`:
     ```bash
     mousepad config.yaml
     ```
   - Change the username and password, then save.
4. **Start BeEF**:
   ```bash
   ./beef
   ```

### Exercise 43: Hacking Windows 10 Using BeEF
If a user accesses a website loaded with a BeEF hook, the attacker can see information about the machine, such as the operating system and browser type. The attacker can then send a fake update to the victim's web browser. If the user allows the update, BeEF will send a reverse shell backdoor, giving the attacker a Meterpreter session and full control over the victim's machine.

#### Steps:
1. **Start Kali and Windows 10 Virtual Machines**.
2. **Start BeEF in Kali**:
   ```bash
   ./beef
   ```
3. **Copy Hook URL**.
4. **Modify Kali Website**:
   - Edit `/var/www/html/index.html` using `leafpad`:
     ```bash
     leafpad /var/www/html/index.html
     ```
   - Add the BeEF hook to the file and save.
5. **Place Malware File**:
   - Place the `reverse_https` malware file under `/var/www/html` and rename it to `update.exe`.
6. **Start Apache Web Server**:
   ```bash
   service apache2 start
   ```
7. **Open BeEF Webpage** in Kali: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/authentication` and log in.
8. **Access Kali Website from Windows 10**:
   - Open Firefox and go to `http://kali_ip_address`.
   - In Kali, check the BeEF page for the new online machine.
9. **Send Fake Update Notification**:
   - In BeEF, go to Commands > Social Engineering > Fake Notification Bar (Firefox).
   - Enter the Kali IP address, malware file name, and notification text.
10. **Set Up Metasploit**:
    - Start Metasploit and set it up to listen for incoming connections from the malware file.
11. **Trigger Update on Windows 10**:
    - Click on the install plugin, download `update.exe`, and run it.
    - Check Metasploit for the established Meterpreter session.

### Hooking Up a Mobile Phone
BeEF works with mobile phones (Android and iOS) through the web browser. You can also send malware to an Android phone as an APK file and convince the victim to run it, giving the attacker complete control over the mobile phone.

To test BeEF with a mobile phone, you can use an Android emulator on your PC or an external server with Ubuntu or Kali OS, loaded with BeEF and a website running the BeEF hook. Browsing the hooked website from the mobile phone will show the phone's information in the BeEF online browsers section.

### Detecting Trojans
A **Trojan horse**, or Trojan, is a type of malicious code or software that appears legitimate but can take control of your computer. It is designed to steal, damage, disrupt, or perform other harmful actions on your data or network.

#### How Trojans Work
You might receive an email from someone you know and click on what looks like a legitimate attachment. However, the email is from a hacker, and the file you clicked on installs malware on your device. When executed, the malware can spread to other files and damage your computer.

#### Types of Trojans
- **Backdoor Trojan**: Creates a backdoor on your computer, allowing an attacker to access and control it.
- **DDoS Attack Trojan**: Performs DDoS attacks by flooding a network with traffic from infected computers.
- **Downloader Trojan**: Downloads and installs new versions of malicious programs on already-infected computers.
- **Fake AV Trojan**: Behaves like antivirus software but demands money to detect and remove threats.
- **Info Stealer Trojan**: Steals data from your infected computer.
- **Mail Finder Trojan**: Steals email addresses from your device.
- **Ransom Trojan**: Demands a ransom to undo damage done to your computer.
- **Remote Access Trojan**: Gives an attacker full control over your computer via a remote network connection.
- **Rootkit Trojan**: Hides or obscures objects on your infected computer to extend the time a malicious program runs.
- **SMS Trojan**: Infects mobile devices and can send and intercept text messages.
- **Trojan Banker**: Targets financial accounts to steal account information.
- **Trojan IM**: Steals login and password information on instant messaging platforms.

#### Protecting Against Trojans
- Use up-to-date Anti-Virus/Anti-malware software.
- Use complex, unique passwords.
- Be cautious with email attachments; scan them first.
- Avoid unsafe websites.
- Do not open links in emails unless you are confident they come from a legitimate source.
- Do not click on pop-up windows promising free programs.
- Never open a link in an email unless you know exactly what it is.

#### Manual Trojan Detection
- Right-click the file and check its properties. If a file looks like a JPG or PDF but is executable, it may be a Trojan.
- Use the Resource Monitor in Windows 10 to see all processes using the internet and their ports.

#### Using Sandbox
- Use sandbox services like [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/) to analyze suspected files before running them on your machine.

### Gaining Access in Real Networks
All previous attacks, such as backdoors and BeEF, work similarly in real networks as in lab environments. The main difference is that by default, internal Wi-Fi routers do not accept incoming connections or do not know how to handle them if they do, as the incoming connections use the public IP address.

#### Configuring the Router
- **Public IP Address**: Check the public IP address using `whatsmyip.com`.
- **Port Forwarding**: Configure the router to forward incoming requests on specific ports to the Kali machine.
- **Metasploit**: Set up Metasploit to listen for incoming connections using the internal IP address of the Kali machine.
- **Router Settings**:
  - Connect to the router using `http://192.168.0.1` (or similar).
  - Log in and look for IP forwarding settings.
  - Add port 8080 and point it to the Kali machine's internal IP address.
  - Set up another rule for port 80 to allow the backdoor to be uploaded from the Kali web server to the victim's machine.

#### Setting Up BeEF for Web Browser Hookup from Outside
- **Change IP Address**: Modify the JavaScript to use the public IP address.
- **Router IP Forwarding**: Configure the router to forward connections on port 3000 (BeEF port) to the Kali machine's internal IP address.

### Website Penetration Testing
Web penetration testing involves using penetration testing techniques on a web application to detect vulnerabilities. It helps identify security flaws, threats, and weaknesses across the entire web application and its components (source code, database, back-end network).

#### Components of a Web Application
- **Server (hardware or virtual)**
- **Server Operating System**
- **Web Server Software (e.g., Apache, IIS)**
- **Database (e.g., MySQL)**
- **Web Application (e.g., PHP, Python)**

#### Information Gathering
- **Whois Lookup**: `http://whois.domaintools.com/`
- **W3dt.net**: Free information gathering tools.
- **Pentest-Tools.com**: Paid web site for info gathering tools.

#### Data to Collect
- **IP Address**
- **Domain Name Info**

By following these steps and guidelines, you can effectively conduct web penetration testing and protect against various types of Trojans and other malicious activities.
