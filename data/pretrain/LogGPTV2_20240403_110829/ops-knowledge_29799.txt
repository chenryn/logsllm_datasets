Question: "In an effort to bolster your web server's security against evasion attacks, you are considering deploying HIDS. A colleague claims that by installing HIDS, the server will be fully protected against path traversal attacks. Based on your understanding of how HIDS operates, which of the following would be the best counterargument to your colleague's claim?"
 "A": "HIDS is ineffective against path traversal attacks because it only analyzes network traffic and not the file system's interpretation of requests."
 "B": "To fully defend against path traversal attacks, HIDS must not only understand the contents of the end request but also how the underlying file system interprets these contents, which could still lead to parsing inconsistencies and evasion attacks."
 "C": "Path traversal attacks are not a concern for HIDS because they typically rely on exploiting the network layer, which HIDS is adept at monitoring and defending."
 "D": "Installing HIDS on the server would make the system more vulnerable to path traversal attacks, as it may introduce additional security flaws."
Answer: B
