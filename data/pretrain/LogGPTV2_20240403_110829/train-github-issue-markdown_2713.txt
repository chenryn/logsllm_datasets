### Describe the feature and motivation
There is no way currently, within OpenCV, to list existing devices to let the
user select them. This means that they must be obtained in a different manner
(either by re-implementing manually, or using a third-party library), which
may not match OpenCV's indexes and may not work on all platforms.
There is a workaround to try every indexes individually, but this has 4 main
issues:
  1. Some VideoCapture devices will freeze if opened and closed quickly or if it was already in use. 
    * The popular SD capture card `GV-USB2` (confirmed myself)
    * I've had reports that an `AverMedia` capture card is affected as well
  2. Some devices take a long time to boot, making this technique quite slow (like my `Logitech c920` webcam)
  3. The total amount of devices is unknown, and usable devices may not be sequential. So we have to guess how many devices maximum the user may have, trying to balance between time spent or risking missing some
  4. Even if you get all the IDs after this, you don't have access to the names to present to the user. (see #23537)
