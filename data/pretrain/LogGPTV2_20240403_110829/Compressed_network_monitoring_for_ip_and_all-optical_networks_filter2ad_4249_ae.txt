Figure 9: Linearity of the physical impairments met-
rics with respect to distance (number of spans on a
lightpath): after a simple transformation, all met-
rics are approximately linear, thereby allowing the
utilization of linear estimation.
Similarly, we show in Fig. 9 that μ2

(essentially) linearly related to the number of links, thereby

where μ10, μ00, σ00 are pre-computed constants that can
also be subtracted from the measurements.
Let y(k) denote the column-vector containing one of the
metrics of interest (yμ12 , yμ02 , yσ12 , or yσ02 ) for all light-
paths established in the network at timestep k. We denote
by x(k) the corresponding per-link metrics. Since the con-

Consequently, in the following, the nonlinear estimation
framework is used to estimate the quantities μ0, μ1, σ0 and
σ1. The linear framework is used to estimate the trans-
formed versions of μ0, μ1, σ0 and σ1, then μ0, μ1, σ0 and σ1
are determined by inverting (8)-(11). In both cases, BERs
are determined via Q factors using (6) and (7).
We now compare the performance of nonlinear estimation
in diﬀusion wavelet bases with that of the linear estima-
tor presented in [5]. Furthermore, we provide the following
lower bound for the nonlinear estimate. Assume that we
were given the possibility to observe lightpaths directly in
the diﬀusion wavelet basis. Then, the best (unachievable)
ns-term estimator would involve selecting the coeﬃcients
with the highest magnitudes in the diﬀusion wavelet basis
and setting all other coeﬃcients to zero. The performance
of this estimator provides a lower bound; we cannot directly
observe projections onto the wavelet basis functions and we

Figure 10: Fraction of estimable and estimated
lightpaths. The BERs of some lightpaths are not
estimable because none of their links is observed
through any other lightpath; among estimable light-
paths, some are not estimated at all because the es-
timates returned by the estimator were physically
meaningless (e.g., negative BER).
do not know, a priori, which ns terms have the highest mag-
nitude, so this bound is very loose in general.
Note that, because monitors are ﬁxed, it is possible that
some lightpaths established in the network are left com-
pletely unobserved, that is, that none of the links of these
lightpaths are measured at any time in the monitoring pe-
riod. These completely unobserved lightpaths are ignored
in our evaluations (since BER estimates for these lightpaths
are based on no information and can only be arbitrary). If a
lightpath uses a link that is part of another lightpath which
is directly observed, we call this lightpath an “estimable”
lightpath. It is possible that an estimator returns a physi-
cally meaningless estimate (BER) for an estimable lightpath
(e.g., a negative BER). We call lightpaths for which phys-
ically meaningful estimates are returned “estimated light-
paths”. We show in Fig. 10 the proportion of estimable
lightpaths to the total number of lightpaths in the network
over the simulation time, and the proportion of estimated
lightpaths (again, with respect to the total number of light-
paths in the network over the simulation time) for each of
the estimators we tested. The monitor placement algorithm
is seen to perform adequately: even if only 5 monitors are
used, more than 60% of the lightpaths are estimable. This
proportion rises to 90% if 15 monitors are used. The non-
linear estimator estimates the BER of all of the estimable
lightpaths, whereas the linear estimator consistently leaves
the BER of a small proportion (5–10%) of estimable light-
paths unestimated unless a very high number (35 and more)
monitors are installed in the network.
In optical networks, only the order of magnitude of the
BER is relevant and hence we work solely with log(BER)
to evaluate the performance of the estimators. We compare
in Fig. 11 the performance of the linear and the nonlinear
estimators in the diﬀusion wavelet framework for the rela-
tive (cid:2)2 error ||(y − yest)||2/||y||2 (top panel) and the relative

Also depicted is the lower bound on the nonlinear
estimation described in the text.
mean error |(cid:12)y − yest(cid:13)|/(cid:12)y(cid:13) (bottom panel), where y is the
vector containing the log of the BER for each lightpath, at
each time instant. We also give 5% conﬁdence intervals. The
performance improvement achieved by the nonlinear estima-
tion technique is largest when few monitors are available. In
particular, when 15 monitors or less are placed in the net-
work (out of a maximum of 42 monitors), corresponding to a
maximum of 90% of estimated lightpaths, the nonlinear es-
timation technique exhibits a signiﬁcant advantage over the
linear estimator in terms of (cid:2)2 norm. In terms of mean BER,
the nonlinear estimator is able to predict the true mean BER
over the network even with a very small number of monitors
(less than 1% error in mean on log(BER) with 5 monitors),
while the linear estimator requires 25 monitors to achieve
the same performance. As was the case for end-to-end de-
lays, the nonlinear estimator has a very low bias. When the
number of estimators increase the gap between the nonlinear
and linear estimation techniques closes and linear estimation
actually performs slightly better than the nonlinear estima-
tion. We emphasize that practical situations are really those
where the number of monitors is small, which is when our
nonlinear framework applies best and performs best.
Moreover, the nonlinear estimation technique applies to
more general situations than the linear estimation frame-
work. Indeed, for the linear estimation framework to apply,
we need to identify a linear relationship between link-level
(x) and lightpath-level metrics (y). For the case of light-
path BER estimation, we were able to deﬁne an approxi-
mately linear relationship for transformed metrics. This ar-
tiﬁcial construct is unnecessary in our nonlinear estimation
framework, since correlation between lightpaths is naturally
modeled through the diﬀusion operator. Finally, we give in
Fig. 11 lower bounds on the performance of the nonlinear
estimator. These lower bounds are substantially lower than
what is achieved by our nonlinear estimator, which is ex-
pected given we picked coeﬃcients directly in the diﬀusion
wavelet basis to construct the bound.
7. CONCLUSION
We have presented a framework for monitoring path met-
rics based on incomplete end-to-end measurements. The
core of the framework is the development of a basis in which
the path metric signal is compressible, which allows us to use
powerful nonlinear estimators from the theory of compressed
sensing. Diﬀusion wavelets provide an appealing mechanism
for developing the basis, because the speciﬁcation of a diﬀu-
sion operator allows us to create very general models for the
correlations between metrics on diﬀerent paths. Case stud-
ies involving the estimation of mean end-to-end delays and
the monitoring of lightpath BERs in all-optical networks
indicate the promise of our framework. Currently we are
investigating the development of alternate bases which can
better capture spatial localization of signal changes. We are
also developing theoretical bounds on the number of paths
that need to be measured to achieve a speciﬁed accuracy.
