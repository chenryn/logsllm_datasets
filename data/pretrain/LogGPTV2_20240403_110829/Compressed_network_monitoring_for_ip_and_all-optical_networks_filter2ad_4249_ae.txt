**Figure 9: Linearity of Physical Impairment Metrics with Respect to Distance**

In Figure 9, we demonstrate that the physical impairment metrics are approximately linear with respect to the number of spans on a lightpath. After a simple transformation, all metrics exhibit a linear relationship, which allows for the use of linear estimation techniques.

Similarly, we show that \(\mu_0^2\) is also (essentially) linearly related to the number of links, suggesting the following approximations:
\[
\begin{aligned}
y_{\mu_1^2} & = G x \mu_1^2 + \mu_{10}, \\
y_{\mu_0^2} & = G x \mu_0^2 + \mu_{00}, \\
y_{\sigma_1^2} & = G x \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_{10}, \\
y_{\sigma_0^2} & = G x \sigma_0^2 + \sigma_{00},
\end{aligned}
\]
where \(\mu_{10}\), \(\mu_{00}\), and \(\sigma_{00}\) are pre-computed constants that can be subtracted from the measurements.

Let \(y(k)\) denote the column-vector containing one of the metrics of interest (\(y_{\mu_1^2}\), \(y_{\mu_0^2}\), \(y_{\sigma_1^2}\), or \(y_{\sigma_0^2}\)) for all lightpaths established in the network at timestep \(k\). We denote by \(x(k)\) the corresponding per-link metrics. Since the constants \(\sigma_{10}\) and \(\mu_{10}\) can be precomputed and subtracted from \(y_{\sigma_1^2}\) and \(y_{\mu_1^2}\) respectively, we have a problem of the general form:
\[
y(k) = G(k)x(k).
\]

Consequently, in the following, the nonlinear estimation framework is used to estimate the quantities \(\mu_0\), \(\mu_1\), \(\sigma_0\), and \(\sigma_1\). The linear framework is used to estimate the transformed versions of these quantities, and then \(\mu_0\), \(\mu_1\), \(\sigma_0\), and \(\sigma_1\) are determined by inverting the equations (8)-(11). In both cases, Bit Error Rates (BERs) are determined via Q factors using equations (6) and (7).

### Performance Comparison

We now compare the performance of nonlinear estimation in diffusion wavelet bases with that of the linear estimator presented in [5]. Additionally, we provide a lower bound for the nonlinear estimate. Assume that we were given the possibility to observe lightpaths directly in the diffusion wavelet basis. Then, the best (unachievable) \(n_s\)-term estimator would involve selecting the coefficients with the highest magnitudes in the diffusion wavelet basis and setting all other coefficients to zero. The performance of this estimator provides a lower bound; however, we cannot directly observe projections onto the wavelet basis functions, and we do not know, a priori, which \(n_s\) terms have the highest magnitude, so this bound is very loose in general.

**Figure 10: Fraction of Estimable and Estimated Lightpaths**

In Figure 10, we show the fraction of estimable and estimated lightpaths. Some lightpaths' BERs are not estimable because none of their links are observed through any other lightpath. Among the estimable lightpaths, some are not estimated at all because the estimates returned by the estimator are physically meaningless (e.g., negative BER).

Note that, because monitors are fixed, it is possible that some lightpaths established in the network are left completely unobserved, meaning none of the links of these lightpaths are measured at any time during the monitoring period. These completely unobserved lightpaths are ignored in our evaluations (since BER estimates for these lightpaths are based on no information and can only be arbitrary). If a lightpath uses a link that is part of another lightpath which is directly observed, we call this lightpath an "estimable" lightpath. It is possible that an estimator returns a physically meaningless estimate (BER) for an estimable lightpath (e.g., a negative BER). We call lightpaths for which physically meaningful estimates are returned "estimated lightpaths."

The monitor placement algorithm performs adequately: even if only 5 monitors are used, more than 60% of the lightpaths are estimable. This proportion rises to 90% if 15 monitors are used. The nonlinear estimator estimates the BER of all of the estimable lightpaths, whereas the linear estimator consistently leaves the BER of a small proportion (5–10%) of estimable lightpaths unestimated unless a very high number (35 and more) of monitors are installed in the network.

### Performance Evaluation

In optical networks, only the order of magnitude of the BER is relevant, and hence we work solely with \(\log(BER)\) to evaluate the performance of the estimators. In Figure 11, we compare the performance of the linear and nonlinear estimators in the diffusion wavelet framework for the relative \(\ell_2\) error \(\frac{\|y - y_{\text{est}}\|_2}{\|y\|_2}\) (top panel) and the relative mean error \(\frac{|y - y_{\text{est}}|}{|y|}\) (bottom panel), where \(y\) is the vector containing the log of the BER for each lightpath at each time instant. We also give 5% confidence intervals.

The performance improvement achieved by the nonlinear estimation technique is largest when few monitors are available. Specifically, when 15 monitors or fewer are placed in the network (out of a maximum of 42 monitors), corresponding to a maximum of 90% of estimated lightpaths, the nonlinear estimation technique exhibits a significant advantage over the linear estimator in terms of \(\ell_2\) norm. In terms of mean BER, the nonlinear estimator is able to predict the true mean BER over the network even with a very small number of monitors (less than 1% error in mean on \(\log(BER)\) with 5 monitors), while the linear estimator requires 25 monitors to achieve the same performance. As was the case for end-to-end delays, the nonlinear estimator has a very low bias. When the number of monitors increases, the gap between the nonlinear and linear estimation techniques closes, and linear estimation actually performs slightly better than the nonlinear estimation. We emphasize that practical situations are those where the number of monitors is small, which is when our nonlinear framework applies best and performs best.

Moreover, the nonlinear estimation technique applies to more general situations than the linear estimation framework. For the linear estimation framework to apply, we need to identify a linear relationship between link-level (\(x\)) and lightpath-level metrics (\(y\)). For the case of lightpath BER estimation, we were able to define an approximately linear relationship for transformed metrics. This artificial construct is unnecessary in our nonlinear estimation framework, since correlation between lightpaths is naturally modeled through the diffusion operator. Finally, we give in Figure 11 lower bounds on the performance of the nonlinear estimator. These lower bounds are substantially lower than what is achieved by our nonlinear estimator, which is expected given we picked coefficients directly in the diffusion wavelet basis to construct the bound.

### Conclusion

We have presented a framework for monitoring path metrics based on incomplete end-to-end measurements. The core of the framework is the development of a basis in which the path metric signal is compressible, allowing us to use powerful nonlinear estimators from the theory of compressed sensing. Diffusion wavelets provide an appealing mechanism for developing the basis, as the specification of a diffusion operator allows us to create very general models for the correlations between metrics on different paths. Case studies involving the estimation of mean end-to-end delays and the monitoring of lightpath BERs in all-optical networks indicate the promise of our framework. Currently, we are investigating the development of alternate bases that can better capture spatial localization of signal changes. We are also developing theoretical bounds on the number of paths that need to be measured to achieve a specified accuracy.
