### S1-MME (Control Plane)
- Carries signaling messages between the base station and the MME.

### S1-U (User Plane)
- Carries user data between the base station and the Serving GW.

### X2, S1-MME, and S1-U
- Refer to 3GPP TS 33.401 for detailed specifications.

### Protection of S1 and X2 Control Plane
- To protect the S1 and X2 control plane as required by clause 5.3.4a, it is necessary to implement IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as specified by TS 33.210 [5].
- For both S1-MME and X2-C, IKEv2 certificates-based authentication according to TS 33.310 [6] must be implemented.
- **Note 1:** If the control plane interfaces are trusted (e.g., physically protected), there is no need to use protection according to TS 33.210 [5] and TS 33.310 [6].

### Protection of S1 and X2 User Plane
- To protect the S1 and X2 user plane as required by clause 5.3.4, it is necessary to implement IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as profiled by TS 33.210 [5], with confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection.
- **Note 2:** If the S1 and X2 user plane interfaces are trusted (e.g., physically protected), the use of IPsec/IKEv2 based protection is not needed.

### Protection of O&M Traffic
- To achieve such protection, IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as profiled by TS 33.210 [5] shall be implemented for all O&M related traffic, i.e., the management plane, with confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection.
- **Note 2:** If the S1 management plane interfaces are trusted (e.g., physically protected), the use of protection based on IPsec/IKEv2 or equivalent mechanisms is not needed.

### S1-AP (S1 Application Protocol)
- Designed by 3GPP for the S1 interface.
- Specified in 3GPP TS36.413.
- Necessary for several procedures between the MME and eNodeB.
- Supports transparent transport procedures from the MME to the user equipment.
- SCTP Destination Port: 36412

### Getting Started with S1-MME
- Only the S1 Setup Request is needed initially.
- Example script: `fake_mme.py`

### Working with S1AP
- After the S1 Setup Request, several messages can be sent.
- Tools:
  - S1AP Scanner (published in the past)
  - S1AP_enum (www.insinuator.net)
  - New scripts: `sctp_mitm.py`

### S1AP and X2AP Functions Overview
- **E-RAB Management Functions:** Setup, management, and modification.
- **Initial Context Transfer Function:** Establishes a S1UE context in the eNodeB to set up E-RABs, IP connectivity, and NAS signaling.
- **UE Capability Info Indication Function:** Provides UE capability information.
- **Mobility Functions:** Manage UE mobility in the LTE network during eNodeB or RAN changes.
- **Paging:** Enables the MME to page the UE.
- **NAS Signaling Transport**
- **S1 UE Context Release/Modification Functions:** Modify and release UE context information.
- **Status Transfer:** Transfers PDCP SN status information between two eNodeBs.
- **Trace Functions**
- **Location Reporting Functions**
- **LPPa (LTE Positioning Protocol Annex) Signaling Transport:** Transfers LPPa messages between eNodeB and E-SMLC.
- **S1 CDMA2000 Tunneling Functions:** Carries CDMA2000 signaling messages between the UE and the CDMA2000 RAT.
- **Warning Message Transmission**
- **RAN Information Management (RIM) Functions:** Transfers RAN system information between two RAN nodes.
- **Configuration Transfer Functions:** Requests and transfers RAN configuration information.

### Operations & Maintenance Network
- When the host 10.27.99.173 on VLAN 3 becomes available, the eNodeB starts searching for an NTP and tries to establish a TCP session with a management system.

### Nmap Results
- **Host 10.27.99.174:**
  - Scanned at 2015-12-28 19:16:02 CET for 842 seconds.
  - Open Ports:
    - 21/tcp: FTP
    - 22/tcp: SSH
    - 23/tcp: Telnet
    - 80/tcp: HTTP (WEBS - OSE web server)
    - 8443/tcp: tcpwrapped
    - 56834/tcp: Unknown

### LMT Software Installation
- Requires Windows XP or later.

### Local Maintenance Terminal Workflow
1. **Fault-State of BaseStation (NoService)**
2. **Engineer Moves On-Site**
3. **Connect to BTS with $tool**
4. **Access Debug Information**
5. **Adjust Configuration**

### Security Considerations
- Setting up and configuring eNBs should be authenticated and authorized to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- 4G BaseStations are network devices with IP connections, as per 3GPP TS 33.401.

### Element Manager
- **Observations:**
  - Outdated Java
  - No password prompt
  - Based on HTTP and GIOP
  - Transmits current configuration data of the BTS
  - Allows configuration changes

### Credentials
- **Username:** rbs / cellouser
- **Password:** rbs

### Webserver
- **Running:** WEBS - OSE web server
- **Features:**
  - EM Download
  - XML Configuration
  - Java JDK (various versions)
  - Not very load-resistant, leading to potential DoS

### Insights
- The device was not wiped.
- No IPSEC on S1 interface.
- Hardcoded and default credentials.
- Telnet in use.
- Unencrypted maintenance interface.

### Ownership
- Appears to be a BaseStation from the US.
- Logfile indicates S1 Connection failure for PLMN mcc:311 mnc:660.

### Using passwd
- Users: cellouser and rbs
- Changing the password for rbs also changes the password for cellouser.

### SSH Access
- Enabled, but the only supported key exchange algorithm is disabled by default in current SSH clients.
- Use: `ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 PI:EMAIL`

### Cell & UE Traces
- The eNodeB can create traces for cells and UEs.
- Found traces contain data on packet loss, but no "interesting" information.

### GIOP Remote Session
- The eNodeB attempts to establish a TCP session with 5.211.14.4.
- Sends a simple GIOP request, possibly Java IDL: Interoperable Naming Service (INS).

### IP Address: 5.211.14.4
- The only public IP address the device talks to.
- Located in Iran, despite the operator being MetroPCS, USA.
- Registered in 2012 for an Iranian telco.
- Possible explanations include shared/lent IP ranges or misuse of public IPs.

- Thank you for your attention!
