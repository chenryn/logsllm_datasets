From 3GPP TS 33.401
o
“In order to protect the S1 and X2 control plane as required by clause 5.3.4a, it is 
required to implement IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as specified by TS 
33.210 [5]. For both S1-MME and X2-C, IKEv2 certificates based authentication 
according to TS 33.310 [6] shall be implemented”
o
“NOTE 1: In case control plane interfaces are trusted (e.g. physically protected), 
there is no need to use protection according to TS 33.210 [5] and TS 33.310 [6].”
o
“In order to protect the S1 and X2 user plane as required by clause 5.3.4, it is 
required to implement IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as profiled by TS 
33.210 [5], with confidentiality, integrity and replay protection.”
o
“NOTE 2: In case S1 and X2 user plane interfaces are trusted (e.g. physically 
protected), the use of IPsec/IKEv2 based protection is not needed.” 
o
“In order to achieve such protection, IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as 
profiled by TS 33.210 [5] shall be implemented for all O&M related traffic, i.e. the 
management plane, with confidentiality, integrity and replay protection.”
o
“NOTE 2: In case the S1 management plane interfaces are trusted (e.g. physically 
protected), the use of protection based on IPsec/IKEv2 or equivalent mechanisms is 
not needed.”

S1-AP
o S1 Application Protocol (S1AP), designed by 
3GPP for the S1 interface
o Specified in 3GPP TS36.413
o Necessary for several procedures between 
MME and eNodeB
o Also supports transparent transport procedures 
from MME to the user equipment
o SCTP Destination Port 36412
30
Let‘s get Started!
o S1-MME: Basically, only the S1 Setup 
Request is needed.
o
fake_mme.py
31
Working with S1AP
o After S1 Setup Request, a couple of
messages can be sent.
o S1AP Scanner published in the past
o
S1AP_enum (www.insinuator.net)
o New scripts: sctp_mitm.py
32
S1AP and X2AP Functions Overview
o
E-RAB management functions (setup, management, modifying)
o
An ”Initial Context transfer” function to establish a S1UE context in the eNodeB to setup E-RABs, IP connectivity and 
NAS signaling.
o
UE Capability Info Indication function: providing UE capability information.
o
Mobility functions for UE, active in LTE network in case of change of the eNodeB or RAN (e.g. location change).
o
Paging: provides the capability for the MME to page the UE.
o
NAS signaling transport
o
S1 UE context release/modification functions: modify and release UE context information
o
Status transfer: transferring Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) SN, defined at [31],
o
status information between two eNodeBs.
o
Trace functions
o
Location Reporting functions
o
LPPa (LTE Positioning Protocol Annex) signaling transport: providing the transfer of LPPa messages between eNodeB
and E-SMLC.
o
S1 CDMA2000 tunneling functions: carrying CDMA2000 signaling messages between the UE and the CDMA2000 RAT.
o
Warning message transmission
o
RAN Information Management (RIM) functions: transferring RAN system information between two RAN nodes.
o
Configuration Transfer functions: requesting and transferring RAN configuration information

Operations & Maintenance Network
35
OAM Network
o After the host 10.27.99.173 on VLAN 3 
becomes available the eNodeB starts 
searching for an NTP
o It also tries to establish a TCP session to 
some management system
36

Local Maintenance Terminal
o The workflow
1.
Fault-State of BaseStation (NoService)
2.
Engineer moves on-site
3.
Engineer connects to BTS with $tool
4.
Engineer accesses debug information
5.
Engineer adjusts configuration
40
“Setting up and configuring eNBs shall be authenticated and 
authorized so that attackers shall not be able to modify the eNB
settings and software configurations via local or remote access. ”
o
But, anyhow: 4G BaseStations are yet another Network Device with IP 
connection.

What we see
o Totally outdated Java
o EM is not asking for a password
o EM is based on HTTP and GIOP
o
Transmits current configuration data of the
BTS
o
Configuration changes can be made
43
o Username: rbs / cellouser
o
Password: rbs
Well...
44
Webserver
o Running WEBS - OSE web server
o
EM Download
o
XML Configuration
o Java JDK  (1.1.6, 1.2.1, 1.3.1, 1.4.2, 1.5.0, 
1.6.0)
o Somehow, not very load resistant
 Leading to a DoS of the whole machine

Insights
46
What We’ve Seen so far
o The device was obviously not wiped
o No IPSEC on S1 interface
o Hardcoded & default credentials
o
rbs – rbs
o
cellouser - rbs
o Telnet in use
o Unencrypted maintenance interface
47
And the BS belongs to…?
o Looks like a BaseStation from the US

Using passwd
o We have the users cellouser and rbs
o
By the way, rbs is not in the passwd file
o While checking for use of hardcoded 
passwords in the management tool, we 
changed the user for rbs using passwd
o Afterwards cellouser’s password was also 
change to the password
49
SSH
o SSH access to the device is enabled
o Sadly the only supported key exchange 
algorithm is disabled by default in current 
ssh clients
o

Cell & UE Traces
o The eNodeB is able to create both traces for 
cells and UEs
o We found a set of traces on the device
o Sadly the traces seem to be purely cell 
traces
o
Containing data on packet loss etc.
o
No “interesting” information
51
GIOP Remote Session
o The eNodeB ties to establish a TCP session 
with 5.211.14.4
o When connected it sends a simple GIOP
request
o Seems to be: Java IDL: Interoperable Naming 
Service (INS)
52
IP Address: 5.211.14.4
o This is the only public IP address the device 
talks to
o Strangely (reminder of the operator: 
MetroPCS, USA) the IP address is located in 
Iran
o From the dates we’ve seen the eNodeB was 
initially provisioned and setup in 2013
o
The IP address range was registered in 2012 
for an Iranian telco
53
IP Address: 5.211.14.4
o Looks strange?
o Well, we can not disprove:
o
The IP address range might have been 
shared/let/lent
o
The operator might have misused public IPs
privately
o The port seems to be down
