ities of rain and snow, and so on. Any measurements taken at a
time and location that is not experiencing these weather events is
included towards our estimate of the baseline dropout probability.
Note that some weather events may have after-effects: for instance,
a “snow” event in the weather data from the NWS spans only the
time when snow is actively falling, not the potentially problematic
time when snow is on the ground. To account for such after-effects,
we also exclude the 24 hours after any of these 11 weather types
from our computation of the baseline.
We calculated a single baseline across the 8 years for each bin.
This simple definition of "baseline" dropout probability represents
the dropouts not due to weather for a bin. By considering 8 years of
observations, we were able to (a) observe sample hours of weather
conditions affecting various regions/link types on several occasions
and (b) avoid overfitting the baseline even when we were analyzing
per-state behavior and per-link-type behavior within each state.
Nearly 60% of all of ThunderPing’s sample hours, across all link
types and geographical areas, are included in the baseline.
We experimented with other approaches to calculate the baseline
probability of dropouts and found consistent results. For example,
we excluded other durations (4, 12, 48 hours) in the aftermath of the
11 weather types in Figure 2 from our computation of the baseline;
the results were similar. We also excluded hours with extreme
temperatures from the baseline and found consistent results.
For a given bin, given the observed baseline dropout probability
(λbaseline) and the observed dropout probability during weather
type w (λw ), we attribute the weather-induced dropout probability
to the difference between the two: λw − λbaseline. We refer to this
difference as the inflation of dropout probability (note that this value
can be negative if a weather condition correlates with a decrease
in dropout probability).
2This follows from the fact that var(λ1 − λ2) is approximately var(λ1) + var(λ2) when
Eq. (2) holds.
Controlling for baseline dropouts in this manner allows us to
explore the relative impacts that weather has, but it does not allow
us to attribute a specific cause. For instance, in Section 4.3, we
show that precipitation and dropout inflation are correlated, but we
cannot infer whether that is caused by water seeping into above-
ground wires, increased car accidents, and so on. Nonetheless, we
believe this to be a useful metric for many applications. Whatever
the specific cause, understanding what link types are more resilient
to different weather conditions in different regions of the country
can inform consumers deciding which ISP to use, service providers
anticipating user demand, or regulatory bodies seeking to ensure
nationwide availability.
3.3 Validating a weather baseline
Our notion of a weather baseline applies if and only if there are
no causes of dropouts that occur more often with weather but are
not themselves caused by the weather event. For example, if an ISP
happened to perform address reassignment at a particular time of
day when rain was more likely to occur, then it would appear that
rain caused more dropouts. To rule this out, we verify that weather
events do not positively correlate with common dropout periods.
The first question we must answer is: Are there any hours of the
week that have a significantly higher probability of dropout than
other hours of the week? To this end, we evaluate the probability of
dropouts in each hour of the week in the following manner: for each
hour of the week, we counted the number of dropouts (recall that
dropouts only occur at most once per hour per link) across all links
observed during that hour, then we divided that by the number
of hours in which the link was responsive. We did this for each
link type separately, as some link types may be more likely to be
renumbered [43]. Also, some link types may require maintenance
more often than others.
The results are shown in Figure 1(a). Hour 0 on the x-axis is Sun-
day midnight, UTC. As expected, the hourly probability of dropouts
significantly varies in a diurnal pattern over the course of each week.
Prior work suggests that the increased dropout probability during
weeknights could be attributed to ISPs performing administrative
maintenance [6, 12]. Interestingly, while each link type exhibits a
markedly different dropout probability, all links experience their
highest probability of dropouts in the evening, peak near midnight
Eastern Standard Time (indicated with vertical dotted black lines),
and decrease significantly until the early hours of the morning.
Given that we observe a diurnal variation in hourly likelihood of
dropouts, and the fact that weather conditions also have a known
diurnal pattern of occurrence [60], the next question we must an-
swer is: Does hourly weather occurrence positively correlate with
dropout probability? To answer this question, we count the total
number of responsive hours that we observed in each hour of the
week for each weather condition.
The results are shown in Figure 1(b). As expected, most weather
conditions, possibly except for snow, have a diurnal pattern in their
occurrence. Fortunately, none of the weather conditions have a
positive correlation with the hourly probability of dropouts. This
validates our use of a baseline to measure the relative impact of
various weather conditions.

(b) Weather types vary in their most prominent hours.
Figure 1: Weather conditions are not correlated with what appear to be administrative dropouts.
Baseline probability of dropout depends on link type. The investi-
gation into probability of dropout for each link type also provides
additional justification for the selection of a metric that is based
on the increase in failure probability due to weather. The dropout
probability is significantly different for each link type, with Fiber
being the lowest and Satellite being the highest (Figure 1(a)). With
this metric, the baseline failure rate will be removed from all link
types; including the diurnal variations in dropout probability.
4 WEATHER ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze our collected data to understand how
weather conditions affect dropouts.
4.1 Relative dropout rates
First, we analyze the relative rate of dropouts under various link
types and weather conditions, after omitting all hurricane periods.
We use categorical data from weather records (such as “thunder-
storm present”), to assign weather conditions for each hour. When
multiple weather condition occur in an hour, we count the hour
under all the conditions. We experimented with assigning the most
severe weather condition to each hour and obtained similar results.
The top of Figure 2 shows the number of responsive address-
hours for which we measured the various link- and weather-types.
Although there is a wide range in their absolute values (note the
log-scale of the y-axis), the overall shape of the histograms remains
mostly consistent across the different link types. This reflects the
fact that, in their deployment throughout the US, different link
types are exposed to very similar conditions, with one minor excep-
tion: we did not measure any fiber, WISP, or satellite links during
tornadoes. The top figure also explains the larger range of confi-
dence intervals of the bottom figure for severe weather types (such
as tornadoes and hail) that observed fewer address-hours.
The bottom of Figure 2 shows the difference in the dropout rate
during the presence of a weather condition and the baseline failure
rate. For example, the “Thunderstorm” bar for fiber shows that
fiber addresses experienced an inflated hourly dropout probability
of 0.003496 (+/- 0.000158). We obtained this statistic by observing
702,639 sample hours from fiber addresses in thunderstorm, of
which 3,195 were dropout hours (there were 44,266,075 hours in
baseline of which 46,538 were dropout hours). In the bottom of the
figure, we also include confidence intervals on all bars; they are
tight on almost all values, except tornadoes and hail.
Interpreting inflation in hourly P(Dropout). A value of zero sig-
nifies no observed difference with or without a particular weather
condition; positive values indicate increased probability of dropout
during that weather condition; and negative values indicate fewer
failures during that weather condition. Further, the inverse of the
inflation in hourly P(Dropout) yields the number of address-hours
in a certain weather condition that will likely result in an additional
failure. Thus, when fiber addresses receive 286 address-hours (or
12 days3) of thunderstorm, they will experience one dropout-hour
more than they would have in baseline. Figure 2 shows on the y-
axis the values that correspond to an additional failure once every
month (0.001389) and once every week (0.005952).
We make three key observations from Figure 2. First, most
weather conditions exhibit higher dropout probabilities across all
of the link types we measured, although the extent of the inflation
varies. Hail, thunderstorms, gale-force winds, heavy rain, and (for
the link types that experienced it) tornadoes are particularly dam-
aging; all yield a statistically significant increase in dropout proba-
bilities of more than 0.001389 (one additional failure per month).
Second, for each given link type, heavier rates of precipitation
(both rain and snow) yield higher probabilities of dropout. We
analyze precipitation further in Section 4.3. Interestingly, the prob-
ability of dropouts is greater during thunderstorms than during
heavy rain for all link types. This indicates that the causes of fail-
ures during thunderstorms extend beyond the rainfall, perhaps to
increased wind or power outages.
Finally, the inflation in dropout probabilities of wired link types
(cable, DSL, and fiber) are similar to one another, as are those of
wireless link types (WISP and satellite), but wired and wireless
link types are different from one another. For example, light rain
has almost no discernible difference in dropout probabilities for
wired links, but all forms of rain, including light rain, exhibit higher
dropout probability for wireless links. Conversely, gale-force winds
have a profound increase in dropout probabilities for wired links;
the lowest inflation in hourly P(Dropout) for all wired links is

SIGCOMM ’19, August 19–23, 2019, Beijing, China
This gives us an apples-to-apples comparison across states, even if
they experience weather conditions in varying amounts.

weather conditions (top, log-scale y-axis), and the additional (“inflated”) probability of dropout experienced in those link- and
weather-types (bottom).
for DSL (0.005082, corresponding to an additional failure every 8
days). However, wireless links are proportionally less likely to drop
out during a gale. It is not surprising that strong winds can cause
wired links to fail, for instance by knocking down above-ground
cables. Although wireless links are not affected in the same way, it
is surprising that higher failure rates would not be observed, given
that such strong winds could destroy or blow away satellite dishes.
We also investigated the inflation in hourly dropout probability
in the aftermath of weather conditions to check if failures are more
likely to occur in the hours after a weather event. Only satellite
links experienced statistically significant inflation in hourly dropout
probability exceeding one per month in the aftermath of weather
conditions, primarily in the hours after precipitation.
In Figure 3, we present the hourly dropout probability inflation
across all 50 U.S. states (and DC) for thunderstorms, rain (exclud-
ing hurricanes), snow, and gale-force winds (we omit other severe
weather conditions from Figure 2 since many states did not have
statistically significant results for them). We make two key observa-
tions. First, there is a high variation of increased dropout probability
across states. For example, during thunderstorms, North Dakota
experiences an average increased hourly dropout probability of
0.0124 (2.1 additional failures per week), while Washington D.C. in-
creases by only 0.0015 (0.9 additional failures per month). Moreover,
as shown by the 95% confidence intervals in the figure, these differ-
ences are statistically significant. We believe this to be an important
result because it shows the role that geography plays in network
outages.
Summary and ramifications. The results from Figure 2 collec-
tively show that different link types can experience weather in
different ways. It is not surprising that different link types would
differ in the magnitude with which they experience dropouts; but
the differing patterns of high inflation in dropout probability for
wired and wireless link types across weather patterns are sugges-
tive. These results have ramifications on network measurement
methodology: when performing outage analysis, it is important to
account for both link type and weather condition.
4.2 Geographic variation
Next, we investigate the extent to which different geographic re-
gions experience weather in different ways. Of course, different
states experience different amounts of weather (for instance, we did
not observe a statistically significant amount of snow in Florida).
As in Section 4.1, we present the inflated probability of hourly drop-
outs, comparing address-hours with a particular weather condition
for a state (e.g., snow) against baseline address-hours for that state.
Second, while the raw dropout inflation varies among states, the
relative impact of weather types is common across most states: the
increase in dropouts during thunderstorms tends to be greater than
in rain, which in turn tends to be greater than in snow. There are
a few notable exceptions. Louisiana and Mississippi have more in-
flated dropouts in snow than in thunderstorms, and Hawaii tends to
experience similar amounts of failures in rain as it does in thunder-
storms. By controlling for geography and the total amount of time
spent in weather, this result shows that some weather conditions
have more pronounced impact on dropouts.
Below Figure 3, we present a breakdown of the classified link
types in each state, weighted by responsive address-hours in prob-
ing. We consult this graph to determine whether the outliers in the
top graph are a direct function of the link types that are prevalent

data as in Figure 3 (which includes the confidence intervals), re-visualized here to show regional trends. Large geographic

and southern states in snow. (Note the different scales for each.)
in a state. North Dakota has a substantial and exceptional deploy-
ment of fiber: 50% of the link-type-classified responsive hours are
from fiber addresses. Although our sampling approach is based
on finding 100 addresses in each provider in a region, and thus
is not meant to sample the distribution of link types used by cus-
tomers, we note that this is consistent with published reports that
“60 percent of the households, including those on farms in far-flung
areas, have fiber” [41]. Although there are instances where top
and bottom graphs appear related—Vermont (VT) and Maine (ME)
show both a high vulnerability to thunderstorms and a relatively
large proportion of DSL compared to immediate neighbors CT, NH,
MA—it appears that geography is more important than link type at
determining the inflation in probability of dropout in precipitation.
Next, we look beyond individual states to see if there are re-
gional correlations of dropouts. In Figure 4, we show maps with
the hourly inflation in dropout probabilities during thunderstorms,
rain (excluding hurricanes), and snow. 4 For each U.S. state, this
figure presents the mean hourly inflation in dropout probability
values that we previously reported in Figure 3; we plot these values
During thunderstorms (Figure 4(a)) and rain (Figure 4(b)) Mid-
western states tend to experience greater inflation of dropouts than
other regions. (Maine is an outlier; its dropout inflation during
thunderstorm and rain is due to an abnormally powerful series
of storms in October 2017.) Recall from Figure 2 that WISP and
satellite links fail more often in thunderstorms and rain than other
link types. One possible explanation for higher dropout rates in the
Midwest would be that these states have more wireless links. This
hypothesis is confirmed in Figure 3, which shows that Midwestern
states have more satellite and WISP links than other states.
