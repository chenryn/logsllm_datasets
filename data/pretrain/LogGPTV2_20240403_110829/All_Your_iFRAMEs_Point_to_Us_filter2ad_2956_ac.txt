### Analysis of Malware Distribution via Web Servers and Advertisements

#### 1. Software Vulnerabilities on Web Servers
We begin by examining the software running on web servers for all landing sites that lead to malware distribution. Specifically, we collected "Server" and "X-Powered-By" header tokens from each landing page (see Table 1). Not surprisingly, a significant fraction of these servers were running outdated versions of software with known vulnerabilities. For example, 30% of servers with PHP scripting support reported a version with security vulnerabilities. These results reflect weak security practices among web site administrators. Running unpatched software with known vulnerabilities increases the risk of content control via server exploitation.

**Table 1: Server Version for Landing Sites**
| Srv. Software | Count | Up-to-date (%) | Old (%) |
|---------------|-------|----------------|---------|
| Apache        | 1,000 | 2.5            | 7.0     |
| Microsoft IIS | 115,000 | 2.5            | n/a     |
| Unknown       | 15,700 | n/a            | n/a     |

*Note: We could not verify the version of Microsoft IIS servers.*

#### 2. Malware Distribution via Advertisements
Today, the majority of web advertisements are distributed as third-party content to advertising websites. This practice is concerning because a web page is only as secure as its weakest component. Even if the web page itself does not contain any exploits, insecure ad content poses a risk to the advertising website. With the increasing use of ad syndication, the chances of inserting insecure content along the chain escalate, leading to web pages running advertisements to untrusted content. This provides an attractive avenue for distributing malware without compromising any web server.

To assess the extent of this behavior, we estimated the overall contribution of ads to drive-by downloads. We constructed malware delivery trees from all detected malicious URLs, following the methodology described in Section 4. For each tree, we examined every intermediary node for membership in a set of 2,000 well-known advertising networks. If any nodes qualified, we counted the landing site as being infectious via ads. Additionally, we weighted the landing sites associated with ads based on their frequency of appearance in Google search results compared to all landing sites.

**Figure 1: Percentage of Landing Sites Potentially Infecting Visitors via Malicious Advertisements**

On average, 2% of the landing sites delivered malware via advertisements. More importantly, the overall weighted share for those sites was substantialâ€”on average, 12% of the overall search results that returned landing pages were associated with malicious content due to unsafe ads. This result can be explained by the fact that ads target popular websites, thus having a much wider reach. Consequently, even a small fraction of malicious ads can have a major impact.

Another interesting aspect is that ad-delivered drive-by downloads appear in sudden, short-lived spikes. This is likely due to the centralized control of ads appearing on multiple websites, allowing malicious content to appear almost instantaneously. Once detected, these ads are removed simultaneously, disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Therefore, drive-by downloads delivered by other content injection techniques (e.g., individual web server compromises) have a more lasting effect compared to ad-delivered malware.

**Figure 2: CDF of the Number of Redirection Steps for Ads Delivering Malware**

Our results show that 70% of the landing sites delivering malware via ads use multiple levels of ad syndication. To understand how far trust would have to extend to limit ad-delivered drive-by downloads, we plotted the distribution of the path length from the landing site to the malware distribution sites. The edges connecting the nodes in these paths reflect the number of redirects a browser has to follow before receiving the final payload. For syndicated ads that delivered malware, the path length indicates the number of syndication steps before reaching the final ad, which in our case, is the malware payload.

**Figure 3: CDF of the Normalized Position of the Top Five Ad Networks Most Frequently Participating in Malware Delivery Chains**

Inspecting the delivery trees revealed a total of 5 unique ad networks participating in these trees. We further studied the relative role of different networks by evaluating the frequency of appearance of each ad network in the malware delivery trees. Our results show that five advertising networks appear in approximately 75% of all malware delivery trees. The graph shows that these advertising networks split into three categories:

- **Category 1 (Network I):** The advertising network appears at the beginning of the delivery chain.
- **Category 2 (Networks II-IV):** Advertising networks appear frequently in the middle of the delivery chains.
- **Category 3 (Network V):** In almost 50% of all incidents, the advertising network is directly delivering malware.

Finally, we provide an example from our data corpus. A landing page referring to a Dutch radio station's website showed a banner advertisement from a German advertising site. Using JavaScript, that advertiser redirected to a prominent advertiser in the US, which in turn redirected to another advertiser in the Netherlands. That advertiser redirected to another advertisement (also in the Netherlands) that contained obfuscated JavaScript, which, when unobfuscated, pointed to yet another JavaScript hosted in Austria. The final JavaScript was encrypted and redirected the browser via multiple IFRAMES to adxtnet.net, an exploit site hosted in Austria. This resulted in the automatic installation of multiple Trojan Downloaders. While it is unlikely that the initial advertising companies were aware of the malware installations, each redirection gave another party control over the content on the original web page, with predictable consequences.

#### 6. Malware Distribution Infrastructure
In this section, we explore various properties of the hosting infrastructure for web malware. Specifically, we examine the size of the malware distribution networks and the distribution of binaries hosted across sites. Such analysis is important as it sheds light on the sophistication of the hosting infrastructures and the level of malfeasance we see today. As with other recent malware studies, we hope this analysis will be of benefit to researchers and practitioners alike.
