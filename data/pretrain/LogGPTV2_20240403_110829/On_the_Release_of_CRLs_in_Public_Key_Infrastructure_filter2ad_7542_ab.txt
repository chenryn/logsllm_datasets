Figure 2: Probability of revocation vs. existence age
5.1 Empirical Model
In order to get the size of CRL at any time t, we must
know the behavior of the probability density function
(PDF) of certiﬁcate revocations over time. In the above,
empirically we already show that the percentage of re-
vocations decreases with elapsed time. Next statistically
we derive the underline PDF.
5.1.1 Underline PDF for Certiﬁcates Issued at a
Particular Time
We assume that there are α certiﬁcates issued at time X
with issued age β. To get start, we assume that α is a
constant number. Later we change α to a random num-
ber with a Poisson distribution to study the more general
case. From time X to time X +β, on average αb% of the
certiﬁcates will be revoked. At time X +β, all the certiﬁ-
cates issued at time X will be expired, no matter whether
they have been revoked or not. Let R(t) be the proba-
bility that any given certiﬁcate issued at time X will be
revoked in the interval [t, t + ∆t], where t is between X
and X + β. It also represents the revoked percentage,
which is the number of revocations occurred in the inter-
val [t, t + ∆t] divided by the total number of revocations
occurred between X and X + β (i.e., αb%). Following
the empirical distribution observed in Figure 2, we use
an exponential probability density function to model this
distribution.

R(t) = ke−kt

The most interesting ﬁnding is that most of the certiﬁ-
cate revocations occur at the ﬁrst few days after issued,
and the percentage of revocations decreases with elapsed
time. More than 30% of revocations occur within the
ﬁrst two days after certiﬁcates get issued. This distribu-
tion pattern is very robust, and it is insensitive to which
CRLs we investigated and which years we selected. It
still holds when we pool ﬁve CRLs together.
We use Maximum Absolute Deviation (MAD) to de-
termine the parameter k. The MAD is proposed by
Kolmogorov-Smirnov. It minimizes the largest gap be-
tween the cumulative relative frequency of a given data
set and that of its ﬁtted statistical distribution. In Figure
3, we present both the real empirical data and theoreti-
cally ﬁtted PDF4. The PDF ﬁts the empirical data very
well when the parameter k is equal to 0.26, which is ac-
cepted at a 99% conﬁdence interval.

5.1.2 First Case: A Model for Pooling Certiﬁcates
Issued at Different Time
In the previous section, we only consider the PDF of one
population of certiﬁcates issued at time X. Now consider
that CA issues certiﬁcates at different time. Each gener-
ation of certiﬁcates is composed of certiﬁcates issued at
a particular time with the same issued age β, where the
time interval between two successive generations is ∆t.
At any given time interval [t, t + ∆t], the revocation re-
quests CA received originate from different generations.
In order for CA to decide when to release the CRLs,
on daily basis CA must know: 1) The number of new
revocation requests; and 2) The size of the CRL if it de-
cides to release the CRL on that day. Based on the PDF
derived from the previous section, we build a model to
compute the total number of certiﬁcate revocations when
pooling revocations from different generations.
The number of new revocation requests The PDFs
of revocations from different generations of certiﬁcates
follow the same exponential probability density R(t) =
ke−kt as shown in Figure 4. Suppose that v is any time
in (0, β]. Let f (v) be the number of new certiﬁcate re-
vocations between day v and day v + ∆t, from all of the
valid generations.
f (v) = αb%R(v) + αb%R(v − ∆t) +
αb%R(v − 2∆t) + . . . +
αb%R[v − (n − 1)∆t]
(2)
where n is the number of generations in time period β;
that is, n = d β
∆t
Assuming that ∆t is one day, and that v is an integer,
where v is in (0, β], then we get the following equation.
e.
f (v) = αb%R(1)+αb%R(2) + . . . +αb%R(v)
= αb%ke−k+αb%ke−2k + . . . +αb%ke−vk
= αb%ke−k 1 − e−vk
1 − e−k
(3)
When v is in (β, ∞), we have
f (v) = αb%R(1)+αb%R(2) + . . . +αb%R(β)
= αb%ke−k+αb%ke−2k + . . . +αb%ke−βk
= αb%ke−k 1 − e−βk
1 − e−k

Figure 4: Model for pooling revocations from different

Equations 3 and 4 show that the number of new re-
vocation requests CA received on daily basis increases
with a decreasing rate as time elapses from day zero until
day β. After that, the number of revocation requests on
daily basis becomes a constant number. Figure 5 shows
the number of new certiﬁcate revocations on daily basis
in (0, 2β] for the case where α = 1000, b% = 10%,
k = 0.26, and β = 36 days. From now on we omit the
graph for (mβ, (m + 1)β], where m ≥ 2, because the
shape in those regions are the same as that in (β, 2β].

Considering the (β + 1) day, the revoked certiﬁcates
from the ﬁrst generation are expired, and thus removed
from the CRL. At this time, the number of valid genera-
tions is (β + 1) − 1 = β.
Considering the (β + 2) day, revocation from the ﬁrst
two generations are expired, and thus removed from the
CRL. At that time the number of valid generations is also
(β + 2) − 2 = β.
The rest may be deduced similarly. For any v ∈
(β, +∞), we have

creases with an increasing rate as time elapses from day
0 until the time reaches issued age β. After that, the size
of CRL becomes a constant number. The reason it is
not going to be inﬁnite is that at any time some revoked
certiﬁcates may be expired and removed from CRL. Fig-
ure 6 shows the daily CRL size in (0, 2β] for the case of
α = 1000, b% = 10%, k = 0.26, and β = 36 days.

revocations on daily basis
on day v, includes the new revocation requests on day
v as well as the valid historical revocation requests (oc-
curred before day v) whose expiration day is later than v.
Let F (v) be the valid cumulative number of certiﬁcate
revocations from time 1 to v, where “valid” means not
expired. This is also the size for the CRL if CA decides
to publish it on that day. For any time v ∈ (0, β], we

Equations 7 and 8 show that the majority of the cer-
tiﬁcate revocations occur at early stage of the issued
age of certiﬁcates, right after they were issued. Figure
7 shows the graph of percentage of certiﬁcate revoca-
tions in (0, 2β] for the case of α = 1000, b% = 10%,
