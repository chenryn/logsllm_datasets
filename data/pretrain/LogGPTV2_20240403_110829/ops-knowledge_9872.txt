User: Suppose we are building an online question-and-answer community, which needs to support users to ask, answer, like, and other operations. Please design a data model and use MongoDB as the data storage to implement CRUD operations corresponding to the data model.
Assistant: Data model: 1. User (User) - User ID (user_id): String type, which uniquely identifies a user. - Username (username): string type, displayed on the user's personal page. - Password (password): String type, used to verify the identity of the user. - Email (email): String type, used to retrieve the user's password or receive notifications from the system. - User profile (profile): a document type used to store user-related information, such as user avatar, gender, age, and so on. 2. Question - Question ID (question_id): String type, which uniquely identifies a question. - title (title): string type, used to briefly describe the problem. - Body (content): String type, used to describe the content of the question in detail. - Author ID (author_id): string type, identifying the creator of the question. - Create time (create_time): date type, used to record the time when the question was created. 3. Answer (Answer) - Answer ID (answer_id): String type, uniquely identifies an answer. - body (content): string type, used to describe the content of the answer in detail. - Author ID (author_id): string type, identifying the creator of the answer. - Create time (create_time): date type, used to record the time when the answer was created. - Question ID (question_id): String type, identifying the question to which the answer belongs. - Number of upvotes (upvote_count): Number type, indicating the number of upvotes received by the answer. 4. Upvote - User ID (user_id): String type, identifying the user who upvoted. - Answer ID (answer_id): string type, identifying the answer that has been liked. CRUD operation implementation: 1. Create user: ```python from pymongo import MongoClient client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/') db = client['qa'] def create_user(user): db.users. insert_one(user) ``` 2. Get user: ```python def get_user(user_id): return db.users.find_one({'user_id': user_id}) ``` 3. Create question: ```python def create_question(question): db.questions.insert_one(question) ``` 4. Get question: ```python def get_question(question_id): return db.questions.find_one({'question_id': question_id}) ``` 5 . Create an answer: ```python def create_answer(answer): db.answers.insert_one(answer) ``` 6. Get an answer: ```python def get_answer(answer_id): return db.answers.find_one({'answer_id ': answer_id}) ``` 7. Create an upvote: ```python def create_upvote(upvote): db.upvotes.insert_one(upvote) ``` 8. Get the number of upvotes: ```python def get_upvote_count(answer_id): return db.upvotes.count_documents({'answer_id': answer_id}) ``` 9. Get approval data: ```python def get_upvotes(answer_id): return list(db.upvotes.find({'answer_id': answer_id} )) ``` 10. Get a list of answers: ```python def get_answers(question_id): return list(db.answers.find({'question_id': question_id})) ``` 11. Get a list of questions: `` `python def get_questions(): return list(db.questions.find({}))```
