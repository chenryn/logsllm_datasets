User: If you need to upgrade a running application without interrupting the service and ensure data consistency, please provide a feasible solution.
Assistant: Here is one possible solution: 1. Deploy the application on multiple servers and use a load balancer to distribute the traffic. This way, even if one of the servers needs to be upgraded, the other servers can continue to provide service. 2. On the server to be upgraded, set up a redirection page that redirects all requests to another server. This process requires all users to be notified in advance of which address they should access during the upgrade. 3. During the upgrade, shut down the server to be upgraded and perform the update. After the update is complete, start the server again and reconnect to the system from the load balancer. 4. When all servers are updated, you can cancel the jump page and reconfigure the load balancer to redistribute traffic to each server. Key to the solution is ensuring service continuity during upgrades and providing clear guidance on how users should access the system. It is suitable for applications that require data consistency and can be distributed across multiple servers.
