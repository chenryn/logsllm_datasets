User: How to protect servers and systems from DDoS attacks and prevent sensitive data from being maliciously stolen?
Assistant: Here are some ways to prevent DDoS attacks and data leakage: 1. Choose a reliable hosting service provider or cloud service provider, and make sure that it has installed sufficient defense tools, such as load balancers, intrusion detection systems, and firewalls. 2. Update server and system software to ensure the latest security versions. Install and update antivirus software and other security tools, and perform regular security patches. 3. Implement network security policies, including strict access controls such as security groups, network isolation, etc. 4. A sound backup and disaster recovery plan. Regularly back up databases and other important data and ensure the availability and security of the backup data. 5. Use tools for defending against DDoS attacks, such as the black hole routing strategy of routers and professional anti-DDoS attack equipment, etc., to resist large-scale DDoS attacks. 6. Encrypt all sensitive data and employ advanced authentication technologies such as two-factor authentication. 7. Increase network monitoring and logging to quickly detect and respond to attacks. 8. Work collaboratively to share suspected attack tracking information with various service providers and take action to prevent future attacks.
