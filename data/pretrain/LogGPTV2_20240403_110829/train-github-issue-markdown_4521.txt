## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
https://github.com/caleb15/celeryPickleBugReproduction
# Expected Behavior
Error to not happen. If error is a result of our faulty user code, then I
would expect the celery queue to log a error and continue operating.
# Actual Behavior
We get a AttributeError and the queue dies. Upon celery restart the queue
continues to process events, but eventually hit the same error and dies again.
I can send a link to the sentry error event directly to a celery engineer if
one is interested. Otherwise the relevant info is below:

## What we have tried so far:
We have tried the following without success:
  * Updating python version from 3.6.8 to 3.7.7
  * Upgrading celery
  * Moving most tasks out of the default queue into other queues
  * pinpointing which task caused the error by looking through logs (we have been unable to pinpoint any specific task, the last task processed before error varies)
## [update] identification & cause of error:
Our staff engineer noticed the task responsible in the sentry breadcrumbs and
I figured out that the task was raising a ValidationError that I suspected was
not pickleable. We ignored the error and so far the queue hasn't died on us.
My suspicion was confirmed when a CI failure revealed that the error was
unpickleable:
    test_update_billing_add_ons_ignores_simultaneous_request_error (ff.mods.billing.tests.test_subscription_logic.UpdateBillingAddOnsTestCase) failed:
        ValidationError(b'\n\n
        simultaneous_request\n  A change for
        subscription 456ee8a3881160536ad68346fe91eede is already in
        progress.\n')
    Unfortunately, the exception it raised cannot be pickled, making it impossible
    for the parallel test runner to handle it cleanly.
    Here's the error encountered while trying to pickle the exception:
        AttributeError("can't set attribute")
    You should re-run this test with the --parallel=1 option to reproduce the
    failure and get a correct traceback.
