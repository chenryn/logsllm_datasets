## 190116 (AzSK v.3.10.0)
### Feature updates
Security Verification Tests (SVTs):
* Added support for scanning preview baseline controls for commands GRS/GSS/GACS/GAI using flag -UsePreviewBaselineControls (upbc)
  * This flag can be used solo or together with the -UseBaselineControls for each of these commands.
* Added control in subscription scan to validate mandatory tags at scopes as specified in org policy. Tags shall be validated for name and allowed set of values (or type).
  * To try this, use:  gss -s 'subscriptionId' -ControlIds 'Azure_Subscription_Config_Add_Required_Tags'
OMS product team migration/rebranding to ‘Log Analytics’:
  * Validated that all DevOps Kit OMS scenarios continue to work post transition to 'Log Analytics'.
(Preview) AzSK module for Azure DevOps (VSTS) 
  * Added automation for more controls for Azure DevOps (VSTS)
    *	AzureDevOps_Organization_SI_Review_InActive_Users
    *	AzureDevOps_User_AuthN_Disable_Alternate_Cred
    *	AzureDevOps_Build_SI_Review_InActive_Build
    *	AzureDevOps_Build_SI_Review_InActive_Release
    To try the new Azure DevOps scanning functionality, use the following:
    VSTS scanning is packaged in a separate module called AzSK.AzureDevOps!
    ``
    Install-Module AzSK.AzureDevOps -Scope CurrentUser  
    ``
    ``
    Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "AzSKtestvso"`
                                    -ProjectNames "AzSKDemoRepo"`
                                    -BuildNames "AzSKDemo_CI"`
                                    -ReleaseNames "AzSKDemo_CD" 
    ``
* Org-policy feature updates (non-CSE):
	* ARM Template Checker:
      *	Fixed an issue where the 'isEnabled' property was not being respected at individual control level.
      *	Org policy schema has been updated to include recently added properties to various AzSK objects. 
      *	No action needed from org policy owners.
      *	If needed, the Get-AzSKOrganizationPolicyStatus command can be used to validate that properties used in your policy are schema  compliant    
      *	Changed ‘org -> subscription’ mapping approach following deprecation of older approach by Application Insights product team. If   you need to upload/refresh your org -> subscription details, please use the new approach from the "Create Cloud Security Compliance Report…" section in AzSK organization policy docs at https://aka.ms/devopskit/docs.
