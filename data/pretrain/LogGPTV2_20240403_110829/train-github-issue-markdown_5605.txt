I was beating my head against the wall trying to figure out what I was doing
wrong because this clearly was not unrolling my loop.
`*for="field of fields"` of course needs to be `*for="#field of fields"` >_<
Silently failing here seems bad. The for directive should at least check at
runtime that it is receiving a valid variable declaration and throw if not.
I'll leave it to you all to figure out how to send back useful line numbers
and such ;)
