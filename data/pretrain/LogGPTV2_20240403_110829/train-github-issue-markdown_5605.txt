I was struggling to identify the issue in my code, as it was clear that the loop was not unrolling as expected. The problem turned out to be a simple syntax error: `*for="field of fields"` should have been `*for="#field of fields"`. 

It is concerning that this error was not caught and resulted in silent failure. Ideally, the `for` directive should include a runtime check to ensure that it is receiving a valid variable declaration. If the declaration is invalid, the system should throw an error.

Improving the error handling to provide useful line numbers and more detailed feedback would greatly enhance the debugging experience. I'll leave it to the development team to determine the best approach for implementing these improvements.
