User: I have a lovely Macbook now, and I'm enjoying coding on the move. I'm also enjoying coding in Python. However, I'd like to distribute the end result to friends using Windows, as an executable.
I know that Py2Exe does this, but I don't know how portable Python is across operating systems. Can anyone offer any advice? I'm using PyGame too.
Many thanks
Assistant: If you are planning to include Linux in your portability criteria, it's worth remembering that many distributions still package 2.6 (or even 2.5), and will probably be a version behind in the 3.x series as well (I'm assuming your using 2.x given the PyGame requirement though).
Versions of PyGame seem to vary quite heavily between distros as well.
