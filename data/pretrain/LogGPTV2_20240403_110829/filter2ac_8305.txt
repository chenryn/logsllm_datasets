### ATT&CK Technique: Drive-by Target (ID: T1608.004)

**Description:**

Adversaries may set up an operational environment to infect systems that visit a malicious website during normal browsing activities. This technique, known as a "Drive-by Target," involves compromising endpoint systems through the user's web browser when they visit adversary-controlled websites. 

In such scenarios, the user's web browser is often the primary target for exploitation, and the attack typically does not require any additional user interaction beyond visiting the site. However, adversaries may also use these websites for non-exploitation purposes, such as stealing application access tokens.

**Preparation:**

Before executing a Drive-by Compromise, adversaries must prepare the necessary resources to deliver the exploit to users who browse to the malicious site. This can involve:

1. **Acquiring Infrastructure:** Setting up new, adversary-controlled infrastructure.
2. **Compromising Existing Infrastructure:** Using previously compromised infrastructure.

**Execution:**

- **Exploitation:** The adversary stages the malicious content on the controlled or compromised infrastructure. When a user visits the site, the exploit is delivered to the user's browser, potentially leading to the compromise of the system.
- **Non-Exploitation Behavior:** In some cases, the website may be used to perform other malicious activities, such as stealing application access tokens, without directly exploiting the browser.

By carefully staging and delivering the malicious content, adversaries can effectively compromise systems through this drive-by method.
