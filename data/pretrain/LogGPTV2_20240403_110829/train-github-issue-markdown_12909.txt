Currently, the example 'with-typescript' is using an ugly 'concurrently' to
run asynchronously with next.js.  
I tried to modify the webpack loaders but no hope, next.js required files be
in filesystem/.next folder, not memory. Now I can't use my lovely CoffeeScript
for API constructionðŸ˜–. I have to launch external project for that.
