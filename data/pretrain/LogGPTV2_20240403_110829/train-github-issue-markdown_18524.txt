Hello,
I've been creating notifications with
https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/desktop-
environment-integration.md#notifications-windows-linux-macos
Can someone please confirm what I suspect:
  * There is no way to bind some kind of click handler to a notification, all clicking ever does it close the notification
  * There is no way to add actions/buttons to a notification.
If these are true then I think as they stand, notifications are not very
useful. If this functionality is not possible to implement, maybe it would be
better to provide a standardised BrowserWindow implementation?
As an aside - can anyone recommend a third party package for implementing
cross-platform rich notifications?
Thanks!
