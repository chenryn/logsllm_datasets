## Introduction
- **Data Sources:**

## Data
- **Vulnerability Data:**
  - Linux kernel vulnerabilities from 1999 to present.
  - Manually collected data for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD.

### BSD Kernel Vulnerabilities Over the Years
- **Observation by Theo:**
  - The number 20 was a very low estimate.
  - Are these numbers on equal footing?
  - Many eyeballs theory: Does it hold true in this case?

## Test by Audit
- **Silvio Cesare's Work (2002):**
  - [Presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-03/bh-us-03-cesare.pdf)
  - Indicated no significant quality difference between BSDs and Linux.
  - Limited time spent on BSDs compared to Linux.
  - Questions:
    - Has the situation changed since then?
    - Would more bugs be found with more time spent?
    - Bugs mostly related to integer overflows and information leaks.

### Test by Audit Redux
- **Audit Period:** April-June
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Common Attack Surface:
    - Syscalls
    - TCP/IP Stack
  - Somewhat Less Common Attack Surface:
    - Drivers (ioctl interface)
    - Compatibility Code
    - Trap Handlers
    - Filesystems
    - Other Networking (BT, WiFi, IrDA)

### Syscalls
- **Attack Surface Entry Point:**
  - Obvious attack surface.
  - Syscalls are how userland interacts with the kernel.
  - Number of syscalls:
    - FreeBSD: ~550
    - OpenBSD: ~330
    - NetBSD: ~480
  - Assumption: Well-tested, less likely to contain security bugs.

#### Sample Bug: `sendsyslog` System Call
- **Affected Version:** OpenBSD 6.1
- **Issue:** Unbound length passed to `malloc()` from userland.
- **Impact:** Triggers a kernel panic.
- **Conclusion:** Bugs in syscalls do occur, especially in newly added ones.

### TCP/IP Stack
- **Attack Surface Entry Point:**
  - IP, IPv6, UDP, TCP, ICMP, IPsec, etc.
  - Well-known and long-standing attack surface.
  - Assumption: Well-tested, less likely to find bugs.

#### Sample Bug: IPSEC `setsockopt()`
- **Issue:** Out-of-bound read leading to memory corruption.
- **Affected Versions:**
  - FreeBSD 11
  - NetBSD 7.1
- **Conclusion:** Bugs in the TCP/IP stack do occur, particularly in newer code and mbuf handling.

### Drivers
- **Attack Surface Entry Point:**
  - Numerous drivers for various devices.
  - Exposed entry points in `/dev`.
  - Operations: Open, Ioctl, Read, Write, Close
- **Conclusion:** Drivers are a common source of vulnerabilities due to their complexity and frequent updates.

This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of BSD kernel vulnerabilities, comparing different flavors and highlighting common and less common attack surfaces.
