User: How to shard the database and shard the MySQL database to improve the performance of the database and support higher concurrent visits?
Assistant: The sub-database and sub-table of the MySQL database are mainly to deal with the problems of large data volume, high access volume, and high data complexity, so as to improve the performance of the database and support higher concurrent access. The following are several steps for sub-database sub-table: 1. Determine the rules for sub-table According to business needs, determine how data should be sub-table, such as dividing by time, by user, etc. It should be noted that the rules for sub-tables need to be precise, simple and easy to understand, while taking into account performance and maintainability. 2. Split the data table According to the determined table division rules, the original data table is split into multiple small data tables. In this process, attention must be paid to ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data, and the association between various data tables must also be handled well. 3. Allocation of databases According to business needs, put each small data table in an appropriate database. When choosing a database, you need to pay attention to the load balancing between the databases to avoid a single point of failure. 4. Build an index After splitting the tables, it is recommended to build an index for the key fields of each table to improve query performance. 5. Using distributed database middleware, if you simply use sub-tables to solve the problem, it will increase the complexity of the application code. It is recommended to use distributed database middleware, such as Sharding-JDBC, MyCAT and other tools to automatically process sub-database and sub-table to avoid excessive code complexity. 6. Monitoring and optimization The database after sharding and sharding needs to be monitored and optimized, and performance problems are found to be solved in time to maintain the stability and availability of the database.
