**User:**
I have a web page developed using Python. Currently, I am able to retrieve the IP address of users who access our web page. We would like to obtain the MAC address of the user's PC as well. Is it possible to do this in Python, especially since we are using a Linux-based server?

**Assistant:**
In a web environment, you can only access the information that the user's browser sends to your server. The MAC address is not included in this data. Therefore, it is not possible to directly retrieve the MAC address of a user's PC through a web page, even if you are using a Linux-based server.
