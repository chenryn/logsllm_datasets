### 6.1 Evaluation of Botnet URL Signatures

#### 6.1.1 False Positive Rate
To evaluate the effectiveness of the generated botnet URL signatures, we use the pre-classified labels (spam or non-spam) provided by human users. The false positive rate for each signature is calculated as the fraction of non-spam emails matching the signature to the total number of non-spam emails. For CU signatures, the false positive rates range from 0.0001 to 0.0006. For RE signatures, the rates are between 0.0011 and 0.0014. The aggregated false positive rates vary between 0.0015 and 0.0020.

#### 6.1.2 Ability to Detect Future Spam
In Section 5, we demonstrated that URL signatures generated by AutoRE can detect 16% to 18% of spam on a monthly basis. To further evaluate the effectiveness of these signatures over time, we applied the signatures derived in November 2006 and June 2007 to the sampled emails collected in July 2007.

- **Table 2: Detection of Spam Emails Using Previous Signatures**
  - **November 2006:**
    - CU: 3 spam, 10 non-spam
    - RE: 2 spam, 0 non-spam
    - Total: 5 spam, 10 non-spam
  - **June 2007:**
    - RE: 43,778 spam, 561 non-spam
    - CU: 6,751 spam, 154 non-spam
    - Total: 50,529 spam, 715 non-spam

Signatures from November 2006 were not effective in detecting botnet spam sent in July 2007. In contrast, signatures from June 2007 matched 50,529 spam emails with a low false positive rate. This indicates that spam URL patterns evolve over time, and RE signatures are more robust than CU signatures.

#### 6.1.3 Regular Expressions vs. Keyword Conjunctions
We compared regular expressions and keyword conjunctions (e.g., `token1.*token2.*token3`) in terms of spam detection rate and false positive rate. Both types of signatures produce almost identical spam detection rates. However, regular expressions reduce the false positive rates by a factor of 10 to 30, as shown in Figure 9(b). This is because URL strings often contain human-readable English words and substring segments, making frequent keywords more prone to false positives.

#### 6.1.4 Domain-Specific vs. Domain-Agnostic Signatures
An important step in generating regular expressions is to merge domain-specific signatures into domain-agnostic ones through generalization. After generalization, AutoRE can detect 9.9-20.6% more spam without affecting the false positive rates. Generalization is crucial for detecting future botnet spam from new domains. For example, applying June 2006's domain-specific RE signatures to data in July 2007 identified only 2749 spam emails, while domain-agnostic RE signatures increased this number to 43,778.

### 6.2 Evaluation of Botnet IP Addresses
We evaluated the identified botnet IP addresses to determine if these hosts are indeed spammers and to quantify the total amount of spam received by Hotmail from them. Our evaluation leverages the email server log and human-classified labels on the sampled emails. Each record in the log contains aggregated statistics about the email volume and the spam ratio of each IP address on a daily basis, referred to as a session.

- **Figure 10: Spam Detection Performance Using Botnet IPs**
  - **(a)** False positive rate over the total identified IPs (sessions).
  - **(b)** Total botnet-based spam volume.

Although the identified botnet IPs constitute less than 0.5% of all IP addresses used as email servers, their total spam volume is significant, up to 6% of all spam received. By using a larger set of incoming emails, we expect the number of identified botnet hosts and the fraction of detected spam to increase.

### 6.3 Is Each Campaign a Group?
In the previous sections, we evaluated the signatures and the corresponding botnet IP addresses individually. We are now interested in determining whether each set of emails identified from the same spam campaign was correctly grouped together. To answer this, we examine the similarity between the corresponding destination Web pages, which have been shown to be strongly correlated with the spam campaign [2].

This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the applicability of using AutoRE signatures for botnet spam detection. Using a small number of automatically generated signatures, we detect 16-18% of total spam with a low false positive rate. These signatures are particularly effective in detecting "stealthy" spam that slips through sophisticated filtering systems. Compared to exact URLs or frequent keyword-based signatures, regular expressions are more robust for future spam detection and achieve a low false positive rate. Finally, domain-agnostic signatures are more effective in detecting future botnet spam than domain-specific ones.
