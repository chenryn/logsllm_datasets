User: I've read every other google source and SO thread, with nothing working.
Python 2.7.3 32bit installed on Windows 7 64bit. Download, extracting, and then trying to install PyCrypto results in "Unable to find vcvarsall.bat".
So I install MinGW and tack that on the install line as the compiler of choice. But then I get the error "RuntimeError: chmod error".
How in the world do I get around this? I've tried using pip, which gives the same result. I found a prebuilt PyCrypto 2.3 binary and installed that, but it's nowhere to be found on the system (not working).
Any ideas?
Assistant: This probably isn't the optimal solution but you might download and install the free Visual C++ Express package from MS. This will give you the C++ compiler you need to compile the PyCrypto code.
