User: I need to host multiple Django sites (quite a lot of sites actually) and currently I am using Apache+mod_wsgi but I want to switch to uWSGI. 
One of the nice features of uWSGI is cheaper mode that spawns processes as needed and shuts them down as needed as well. On the other hand, it seems that the way to make it run multiple sites is to use emperor mode. 
Can emperor mode be used together with cheaper subsystem? Are there any quirks/problems I should be aware of? Has anyone ever done this?
Assistant: There are no problems as each "vassal" can be configured with its special cheaper mode. In this way you can have QoS for your customers.
