5.1 Service Modeling with USDL

guages(e.g.OWL-S,WSMO,SoaML,SML,SaaS-DL),business-orientedservice
descriptions (e.g. ITIL and CMMI for Services), and conceptual and ontology-

following reasons (see Section 3 for a deeper comparison):
– It models the business, operational, and technical perspectives of service sys-
tems enabling to reason about the influence of pricing models, legal con-
straints, quality levels, business processes, and agents on service networks’
dynamism.
– A version of the model based on Semantic Web principles, called Linked-
USDL, was developed to provide the means for publishing and interlinking
distributed services for an automatic and computer-based processing.
Nonetheless,requirementR1identifiedinSection4isnotsupported.Inother
words, internal cause-effect relationships are not currently modeled with USDL.
We propose to model them using KPI (Key Performance Indicator) as often
recommended by ITIL and COBIT best practices, and suggested by Spohrer et.
al. in [21]. Our idea is expressed in the following example. Two services – s
a
and s – may establish a cause-effect relationship at the process level between
b
the KPI error rate of a process of service s with the KPI redo cost of a
a
process of service s . When a positive variation of the KPI of s occurs, it can

is an important aspect since a service network is more than the sum of its parts
only if the internal and external ’wiring’ of services are established. To support
requirement R3, and since time-bounds are a central variable in system theory
and provides a referent for the very idea of dynamics, we propose an extension
to USDL by using the formal time ontology proposed by Pan and Hobbs [22].

by allowing service systems to state their attractiveness to serve as the selecting

What is needed is to be able to represent and identify richer relationships
between services. This requirement goes well beyond what is offered by current
approaches. While other types of relationships are also important, e.g. between
services and actors, we follow the service-dominant logic [11] principal and con-
sider that any other type of relationship is always mediated by services. This
simplifies the construction and analysis of a network since all the nodes are ho-
mogeneous, i.e. they are services. Therefore, relations can occur between the
actors that operate inside two service systems connected by a relationship.
We adopted the OSSR model, a multi-layer relationship specification com-
posed of five layers: 1) role, 2) level, 3) involvement, 4) comparison, and 5)
association. The model enables to interconnect services and indicate the prop-
erties of the connection. For example, it enables to indicate that two services
maintain a relationship and one service is the consumer while the other is the
provider. It also enables to indicate if a relationship represents a high or low
involvement from its actors, or if a service is functionally dependent on another
service.

cause-effect relationships betweenservices(requirementR2).Toresolvethislim-
itation,andtobeconsistentwiththewaywehaveaddressedrequirementR1,we
rely on KPIs. For example, if a provider is competing by providing an efficient
service, then internal KPIs related with activities’ duration should be linked to
KPIs of the same type present in other services of the same network. In other
words, internal KPIs must be related to the KPIs of other service systems when
formingservicenetworks.RequirementR3willalsobeaddressedbyincludingthe
modeling of time in relationships indicating that they are often time-bounded.
6 Modeling Dynamic Behavior
Based on the limitations identified in Section 5, we present three extensions to
USDL and OSSR to model dynamic OSSN: 1) attractiveness, 2) cause-effect
relationships, and 3) time bounding.
TheattractivenessorpreferentialattachmentisexpressedbyaddingtoUSDL
the concept usdl-core:ValueProposition. It allows service systems to state
their value proposition by using a single KPI or a mathematical expression in-
volving several KPIs. If should be noticed that more complex structures have
beenproposed(see[24])tomodelavalueproposition.Nonetheless,inourwork,
we are particularly concerned in showing that value propositions are a corner
stone to simulate service systems dynamics rather than showing the complete-
ness of value proposition. Therefore, we opt to explore the utility of measurable
value propositions.
8 Jorge Cardoso et al.
While USDL does not foresee the definition of KPIs, its model is organized
into several clusters (e.g. service level and pricing) which provide a wealth of
variables which can be used as KPIs. For example, service level and quality of
service variables such as availability, reliability, and response time. The value

sionsusingusdl-sla:ServiceLevelExpression.Thecalculationoftheexpres-
sionyieldsthevalueproposition.WhiletheadditionofasingleconcepttoUSDL
seems simple, its implications are enormous. Preferential attachments [8] have
been shown to be the main distinguishing feature which leads random networks
to evolve into scale-free networks in particular domains such as the Web or so-
cial networks [10]. Thus, we can hypothesize that it can potentially be also a
key factor which influences and determines the topological evolution of service
networks.

Fig. 2. The structure of the OSSR model
To model cause-effect relationships, we use the concept of causality from the
area of System Dynamics (SD) [9] to express and quantify the impact that one
service has in other services. Internal and external relationships of an OSSN are
specified using the concept ossr:Relationship of the OSSR model (Figure 2).

Causality more than once. The concept can be thought as a ’wire’ connecting
twointernalorexternalservicesystemKPIsdescribedwithUSDL.Theconcept
Open Semantic Service Networks: Modeling and Analysis 9
Causality describes how a Cause event occurring in a service has an Effect
in the same or in another service. The concept Link connects two KPIs and
sets the sign of the link: Positive or Negative. A positive link indicates that
a change in a service KPI (increase or decrease) results in the same type of
change in another service KPI (increase or decrease). A negative link indicates
that a change in a service KPI results in the opposite change in another service
KPI. KPIs are described within the concepts Cause and Effect. For example,
if a service provider uses Invoice Reliability as a KPI to control the quality of
a service, it can be connected to the Response Time Delivery KPI of a service
customer. An increase of the first KPI originates an increase in the second KPI
since errors in the invoice require time to be resolved.
Since KPIs are often domain dependent and their semantics may not always
be clear to analysts, individual measures of performance in a cause-effects re-
lation are classified by the concept Category in one of five elements (c.f. [25]):
quality,time,cost,flexibility,andother.Thecategory’other’wasaddedtomake
the classification complete.
Time, one of the aspects identified by requirement R3, was modeled by
using the time ontology http://www.w3.org/2006/time by adding the class
time:Interval. This class contains the properties time:hasBeginning and
time:hasEndtodefinethebeginningandtheendofanintervalinwhichaservice
specification is valid. While it is a simple concept, the time ontology provides a
powerful mechanism to reason about the dynamics of service networks.

also seen as service systems. The network is bipartite and is represented by
SN, such as SN(t) = {S(t),C(t),R(t),f(t)}, where S(t) is the set of services
provided, C(t) is the set of service consumers, S(t) and C(t) are modeled with
