certutil [options] -URLcache [URL | CRL | * [delete]]
Where:
URL is the cached URL.

[-f] [-user] [-urlfetch] [-dc DCName] [-t timeout]
Tip
The ability to specify an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain [Domain] and to specify a domain controller (-dc) was added in Windows Server 2012. To successfully run the command, you must use an account that is a member of Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins. The behavior modifications of this command are as follows:1. If a domain is not specified and a specific domain controller is not specified, this option returns a list of domain controllers to process from the default domain controller.2. If a domain is not specified, but a domain controller is specified, a report of the certificates on the specified domain controller is generated.3. If a domain is specified, but a domain controller is not specified, a list of domain controllers is generated along with reports on the certificates for each domain controller in the list.4. If the domain and domain controller are specified, a list of domain controllers is generated from the targeted domain controller. A report of the certificates for each domain controller in the list is also generated.
For example, assume there is a domain named CPANDL with a domain controller named CPANDL-DC1. You can run the following command to a retrieve a list of domain controllers and their certificates that from CPANDL-DC1: certutil -dc cpandl-dc1 -DCInfo cpandl
certutil -dc cpandl-dc1 -DCInfo cpandl
-entinfo
Displays information about an enterprise Certificate Authority.

certutil [options] -scroots delete [readername]
[-f] [-split] [-p Password]
-DeleteHelloContainer
Deletes the Windows Hello container, removing all associated credentials that are stored on the
device, including any WebAuthn and FIDO credentials.
Users will need to sign out after using this option for it to complete.
CertUtil [Options] -DeleteHelloContainer
-verifykeys
Verifies a public or private key set.
certutil [options] -verifykeys [keycontainername cacertfile]
Where:
keycontainername is the key container name for the key to verify. This option defaults to machine keys. To switch to user keys, use -user.
-user
cacertfile signs or encrypts certificate files.
[-f] [-user] [-silent] [-config Machine\CAName]
Remarks
If no arguments are specified, each signing CA certificate is verified against its private key.
This operation can only be performed against a local CA or local keys.
-verify

certutil [options] -verify certfile [applicationpolicylist | - [issuancepolicylist]]

Where:
certfile is the name of the certificate to verify.
applicationpolicylist is the optional comma-separated list of required Application Policy ObjectIds.
issuancepolicylist is the optional comma-separated list of required Issuance Policy ObjectIds.
cacertfile is the optional issuing CA certificate to verify against.
crossedcacertfile is the optional certificate cross-certified by certfile.
CRLfile is the CRL file used to verify the cacertfile.
issuedcertfile is the optional issued certificate covered by the CRLfile.
deltaCRLfile is the optional delta CRL file.
[-f] [-enterprise] [-user] [-silent] [-split] [-urlfetch] [-t timeout]
Remarks
Using applicationpolicylist restricts chain building to only chains valid for the specified Application Policies.
Using issuancepolicylist restricts chain building to only chains valid for the specified Issuance Policies.
Using cacertfile  verifies the fields in the file against certfile or CRLfile.
Using issuedcertfile verifies the fields in the file against CRLfile.
Using deltaCRLfile verifies the fields in the file against certfile.
If cacertfile isn't specified, the full chain is built and verified against certfile.
If cacertfile and crossedcacertfile are both specified, the fields in both files are verified against certfile.
-verifyCTL
Verifies the AuthRoot or Disallowed Certificates CTL.
certutil [options] -verifyCTL CTLobject [certdir] [certfile]
Where:
CTLobject identifies the CTL to verify, including:
AuthRootWU - Reads the AuthRoot CAB and matching certificates from the URL cache. Use -f to download from Windows Update instead.
-f
DisallowedWU - Reads the Disallowed Certificates CAB and disallowed certificate store file from the URL cache. Use -f to download from Windows Update instead.
-f
AuthRoot - Reads the registry-cached AuthRoot CTL. Use with -f and an untrusted certfile to force the registry cached AuthRoot and Disallowed Certificate CTLs to update.
-f
Disallowed - Reads the registry-cached Disallowed Certificates CTL. Use with -f and an untrusted certfile to force the registry cached AuthRoot and Disallowed Certificate CTLs to update.
-f
CTLfilename specifies the file or http path to the CTL or CAB file.
certdir specifies the folder containing certificates matching the CTL entries. Defaults to the same folder or website as the CTLobject. Using an http folder path requires a path separator at the end. If you don't specify AuthRoot or Disallowed, multiple locations will be searched for matching certificates, including local certificate stores, crypt32.dll resources and the local URL cache. Use -f to download from Windows Update, as needed.
-f
certfile specifies the certificate(s) to verify. Certificates are matched against CTL entries, displaying the results. This option suppresses most of the default output.
[-f] [-user] [-split]
-sign
Re-signs a certificate revocation list (CRL) or certificate.
certutil [options] -sign infilelist | serialnumber | CRL outfilelist [startdate+dd:hh] [+serialnumberlist | -serialnumberlist | -objectIDlist | \@extensionfile]
certutil [options] -sign infilelist | serialnumber | CRL outfilelist [#hashalgorithm] [+alternatesignaturealgorithm | -alternatesignaturealgorithm]
Where:
infilelist is the comma-separated list of certificate or CRL files to modify and re-sign.
serialnumber is the serial number of the certificate to create. The validity period and other options can't be present.
CRL creates an empty CRL. The validity period and other options can't be present.
outfilelist is the comma-separated list of modified certificate or CRL output files. The number of files must match infilelist.
startdate+dd:hh is the new validity period for the certificate or CRL files, including:
optional date plus
optional days and hours validity period
If both are specified, you must use a plus sign (+) separator. Use now[+dd:hh] to start at the current time. Use never to have no expiration date (for CRLs only).
now[+dd:hh]
never
serialnumberlist is the comma-separated serial number list of the files to add or remove.
objectIDlist is the comma-separated extension ObjectId list of the files to remove.
@extensionfile is the INF file that contains the extensions to update or remove. For example:
[Extensions]
    2.5.29.31 = ; Remove CRL Distribution Points extension
    2.5.29.15 = {hex} ; Update Key Usage extension
    _continue_=03 02 01 86
hashalgorithm is the name of the hash algorithm. This must only be the text preceded by the # sign.
#
alternatesignaturealgorithm is the alternate signature algorithm specifier.
[-nullsign] [-f] [-silent] [-cert certID]
Remarks
Using the minus sign (-) removes serial numbers and extensions.
Using the plus sign (+) adds serial numbers to a CRL.
You can use a list to remove both serial numbers and ObjectIDs from a CRL at the same time.
Using the minus sign before alternatesignaturealgorithm allows you to use the legacy signature format. Using the plus sign allows you to use the alternate signature format. If you don't specify alternatesignaturealgorithm, the signature format in the certificate or CRL is used.
