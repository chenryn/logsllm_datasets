Certainly! Here is the optimized and more clearly structured version of your log line template:

**Template:**
```
NIFF: node node-<NODE_ID> has detected an available network connection on network <NETWORK_ADDRESS> via interface alt0
```

**Explanation:**
- `<NODE_ID>`: A placeholder for the specific node identifier (e.g., `203`).
- `<NETWORK_ADDRESS>`: A placeholder for the specific network address (e.g., `5.5.224.0`).

This format makes it clear that the placeholders represent specific, variable parts of the log message.
