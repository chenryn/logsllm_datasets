The (ARC) is based on the properties and 
entities of the events, their distribution and 
anomalous rate (compared to their normal 
behavior), previous occurrences and more.

Sophie’s Value 
Bridges between the detection and analysis worldSophie will do everything it can to save you the need to sift through the logs. 
As opposed to traditional log management solutions, Sophie:
 Proactively discovers abnormalities as-they-occur, catching the problems before they escalate
Saves time, automates the root-cause analysis, often accompanying it with insights and a recommended course of action
