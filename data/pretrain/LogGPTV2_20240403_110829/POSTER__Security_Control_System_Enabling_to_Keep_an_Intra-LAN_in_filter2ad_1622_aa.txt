Abstract 
The existing secure data aggregation approaches for wireless sensor networks  were not designed for authorization, 
energy  efficiency  and  proper  security,  leaving  them  prone  to  attacks.  In  this  paper,  we  introduce  the  secure  data 
aggregation using the access control and authentication (SDAACA) protocol. Using this protocol, we aim to detect 
two  severe  types  of  attacks:  sinkhole  and  Sybil  attacks  that  are  difficult  to  detect  by  existing  cryptographic 
approaches. The proposed SDAACA protocol consists of two novel algorithms: the secure data fragmentation (SDF) 
and the node joining authorization (NJA). The SDF algorithm hides the data from the adversary by fragmenting  it 
into small pieces. In the NJA algorithm, an authorization process is initiated before allowing any new node to join 
the  network.  Both  algorithms  help  improve  the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  parameters.  Moreover,  we  propose  an 
access  control  scheme  that  supports  accuracy,  energy  efficiency,  freshness  and  authentication  by  reducing  the 
communication  overhead  and  guaranteeing  the  communication  authenticity  process.  Furthermore,  the  proposed 
protocol  is  mapped  on  the  oil-refinery  plant  to  prevent  and  detect  both  sinkhole  and  Sybil  attacks  in  presence  of 
static  and  mobile  sensor  nodes.  Finally,  we  show  the  effectiveness  of  our  proposed  protocol  through  extensive 
simulations and a comparative study of other known secure data aggregation protocols.

1.  Introduction and Background Study 
Wireless  Sensor  Network  (WSN)  applications  have  emerged  as  a  promising  technology.  They  are  ubiquitous  and 
can  be  deployed  for  mission  critical  applications  such  as  military  surveillance,  smart  grid,  smart  purposes,  health 
care, target monitoring etc. [1-6]. During these applications, small low cost sensor nodes should be deployed at large 
scale [7-8]. Due to resource constraints, several problems such as depleted battery energy and limited computational 
capability  can  occur  [9-10].  The  sensors  consume  more  energy  in  transmission  compared  to  the  computational 
process  [11],  therefore  the  amount  of  transmission  overhead  should  be  reduced  as  low  as  possible  to  prolong  the 
Page 2 of 21network lifetime.  Large scale WSNs produce  a significant amount of data, creating  high  possibilities of redundant 
raw  data  or  a  data  compromise  by  malicious  sensor  nodes.  Therefore,  it  is  of  paramount  significance  to  design 
secure  and  efficient  data  processing  approaches  to  reduce  the  data  redundancy  and  amount  of  transmission.  The 
secure data aggregation is an indispensable paradigm to remove the data redundancy and preserve additional energy 
consumption [12-18].  
The  secure  access  control  is  very  important  for  successful  data  aggregation,  particularly  for  sensitive  applications 
where  a  marginally  different  result  may  lead  to  a  controversial  decision.  In  certain  applications  (e.g.,  forest  fire 
monitoring,  battlefield  surveillance  etc.),  such  aberration  deviating  from  the  perfect  outcome  may  lead  to  severe 
consequences.  Hence,  aggregation  accuracy  with  access  control  could  save  energy  and  improve  the  Quality  of 
Service  (QoS)  [19].  For  example,  the  sensor  networks  may  be  organized  for  a  particular  environment  such  as  a 
human  body  and  houses.  People  might  demand  privacy  protection  such  that  the  data  aggregation  in  these 
applications require secure access control to preserve the data privacy and integrity. Thus, such environments face 
limitations  for  the  architecture  design.  Data  aggregation  should  be  obtained  with  low  communication  and  high 
accuracy  as  much  as  possible  without  tampering  the  data  privacy.  However,  the  WSNs  inherit  some  restrictions. 
First, there are energy limitations due to smallness of the sensor design. Second, there is a susceptibility limitation 
due  to  the  deficiency  in  the  physical  fortification  and  open  nature  of  wireless  communication  channels.  Due  to 
resource  limitations  of  sensor  nodes,  symmetric  key  cryptography  is  a  better  choice  to  employ  as  compared  to 
asymmetric key cryptography. Therefore, many researchers started working on implementing data aggregation using 
symmetric key cryptographic protocols [20–21]. However, symmetric key cryptographic protocols are vulnerable to 
exploits [22]. To combat these limitations, the homomorphic encryption and Message Authentication Codes (MAC) 
are introduced to improve the authentication, integrity and confidentiality for secure data aggregation in WSNs [23]. 
However, the MAC only attempted to handle the message-authentication problem without addressing other security 
constraints  such  as  confidentiality.  In  addition,  communication  and  computational  overheads  were  not  properly 
handled, which could lead to additional energy consumption.  
The asynchronous-based synopsis diffusion approach (SDA) is introduced to address confidentiality and overcome 
the  problem  of  false  sub-aggregate  values  contributed  by  bargained  sensor  nodes  [4].  False  sub-aggregates  could 
create  large  errors  in  the  aggregate  computed  at  the  sink  station.  The  SDA  contribution  aims  to  enable  the  sink 
station  to  securely  calculate  the  predicate  count  or  sum,  even  in  the  presence  of  false  sub-aggregate  attacks.  The 
proposed attack-resilient algorithm calculates the true aggregate by reducing the effect of compromised nodes in the 
aggregation  hierarchy  in  order  to  maintain  the  integrity.  However,  Sybil  and  sinkhole  attacks  are  devastating  and 
completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the legitimate sensor nodes. In result to 
these attacks, the accuracy is compromised and excess energy is consumed. The secure data aggregation technique 
(SDAT) is proposed for improving the security and focusing on the compromising attacks that make the aggregation 
highly vulnerable [24]. Since WSNs are generally unattended without alter-resilient hardware, they can be extremely 
prone to such attacks. The SDAT also analyzes several filtering algorithms to determine the most robust scheme for 
handling collusion attacks and propose an improvement by deploying the initial approximation for those algorithms 
that makes them more robust from said collusion. 
Secure and energy-efficient data aggregation (SEEDA) is proposed to detect the behavior of malicious nodes to keep 
the  BS  safe  from  forged  aggregation  results  [25].    The  SEEDA  creates  trade-off  between  communication, 
computation,  and  security  to  fit  in  multiple  applications.  However,  this  scheme  attempted  to  protect  only  the  BS. 
The  energy-efficient  and  scalable  secure  data  aggregation  (ESSDA)  is  proposed  to  secure  the  data  aggregation  by 
deploying  a  secure  channel  and  slicing  technology  [26]. The  ESSDA  aims  to  save  energy  without  encrypting  and 
decrypting  the  data  which  makes  data  aggregation  vulnerable.  Fully-homomorphic  Encryption-based  Secure  Data 
Aggregation (FESA) addresses the end-to-end confidentiality and handles the arbitrary aggregation process over the 
encrypted data [27]. The existing approaches handle the confidentiality or energy efficiency, but do not address the 
accuracy and communication overhead during the secure data aggregation operation.  
In  this  paper,  we  present  an  access  control  scheme  that  quantifies  falsely  calculated  aggregated  data  and  supports 
secure authentication. Our proposed approach involves two novel algorithms: SDF and NJA. The SDF algorithm is 
used in our proposed scheme to hide the fragmented data from adversaries. This approach is unique as compared to 
the  other  existing  approaches  which  apply  traditional  algorithms  to  send  the  data  to  next  node  without 
fragmentation. Although these existing algorithms are indubitably impressive for ad-hoc networks, they are not fully 
suitable for tiny sensor nodes. As a result, they increase the overhead and reduce the network efficiency which is not 
desirable in WSNs. On the other hand, the NJA algorithm is used to enforce restrictions on a new node when joining 
the  network.  The  NJA  algorithm  authenticates  the  credential  of  each  node  prior  to  allowing  the  node  to  join  the 
Page 3 of 21network.  Thus,  both  algorithms  help  in  improving  the  Quality-of-Service  parameters.  Furthermore,  our  proposed 
approach  provides  the  energy  and  accuracy  models  that  quantify  the  energy  level  of  each  participating  node  and 
ensure the accurate data delivery.  As a result, these proposed  models  improve the  network lifetime and avoid any 
possible  data  loss  in  case  of  node  failure  due  to  energy  depletion.  The  Sybil  and  Sinkhole  attacks  are  particularly 
detected  using  data  set  for  those  attacks.  Finally,  our  approach  contributes  the  idea  of  the  intermediary  node  to 
reduce  the  communication  overhead.  The  intermediary  node  consists  of  three  units:  processing,  service,  and 
aggregating controls that function as a single unit to reduce the extra overhead of the network. 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  In  section  2,  system  model  and  design  objectives  of  the  proposed 
scheme  are  presented.  In  section  3,  secure  data  aggregation  using  access  control  and  authentication  model  is 
presented. In section 4, simulation setup and experimental results are discussed. Finally, we summarize our research 
findings with the future direction in section 5. 
2.  System Model and Design Objectives 
In  our  proposed  model,  one  of  our  design  objectives  is  to  generate  a  secure  aggregation  scenario  to  model  and 
simulate  the  security  issues  of  an  oil-refinery  plant  which  is  currently  facing  several  security  challenges.  The 
majority of these security challenges have a common factor of an unknown access vector. Because of that unknown 
access vector, there is no adequate forensic validation that exists to apply the procedure for intrusion. In other words, 
these challenges pose a significant threat to an oil-refinery plant by possibly affecting its main operational functions 
such as monitoring tools, system-controls, operational processes, architectures, network security, endpoints, etc. The 
network  is  vulnerable  to  several  security  threats  that  can  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  network  performance 
including operations, endpoints, and system-controls. It should be noted that the scenario is generated and simulated 
using the network simulator-3. This simulation resembles the realistic oil-refinery plant scenario depicted in Figure 
1.  
For the system model, we assume that a WSN has a clustered-based topology consisting of mobile and static sensor 
nodes with limited resources. The sensor nodes collectively accomplish the monitoring tasks. However, due to cost 
limitations,  the  sensor  nodes  are  not  equipped  with  tamper-resilient  hardware.  In  addition,  there  exists  stationary 
resourceful heterogeneous sensor nodes positioned on main locations that are directly connected  to the base station 
(BS). The aggregation process is performed in each cluster.  
We use  five types of sensor  nodes in the  WSN: cluster nodes,  BS, cluster head, aggregator, and  event-monitoring 
nodes. The cluster nodes can become a part of different clusters which are responsible to receive and transfer data to 
their respective head-nodes. The BS is the point where the aggregated results are received. We assume that the BS 
possesses  considerably  more  computational  memory  and  power  and  has  sufficient  energy  resources  (e.g.,  power 
gird)  as  compared  to  other  sensor  nodes.  The  BS  is  responsible  to  accomplish  the  data  visualization  and  analysis 
before it  forwards the collected aggregated data to the remote application  server. The remote application server is 
assumed  to  be  a  centralized  point  where  all  the  received  data  is  further  analyzed  at  a  relatively  wider  scale. 
Furthermore,  the  BS  defines  the  specific  roles  of  sensor  nodes  which  are  deployed  at  different  levels.  However, 
when the cluster node is leaving or joining the network, it is only required to inform the cluster head node but not 
the BS. The cluster head node informs the BS regarding the joining and leaving of the cluster. On the other hand, 
aggregating  nodes  are  static  which  are  deployed  prior  to monitoring  process  and  their  information  is  stored  at  the 
BS.  
The cluster head node serves as a coordinator among the other cluster nodes and it is responsible for forwarding the 
data  originated  from  other  clusters  to  the  BS.  Moreover,  it  also  performs  a  constant  data  aggregation  and  event-
monitoring operation. The aggregator node is responsible for forwarding the queries, aggregating the collected data 
by applying the access control and authentication procedures and forwarding the secure data to its head node of the 
cluster. The event-driven node uses a ‘‘slicing and assembling” approach as discussed in [7] for privacy protection. 
Therefore,  event-driven  nodes  are  responsible  for  decomposing  the  primitive  data  into  fragments  (explain  in 
Algorithm  1)  and  sending  the  fragments  to  one-hop  neighboring  nodes.  When  one-hop  neighboring  nodes  receive 
the  slices,  they  assemble  and  achieve  new  results  and  forward  to  the  next-hop  nodes.  We  use  different  types  of
