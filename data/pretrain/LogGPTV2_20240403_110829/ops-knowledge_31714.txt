It seems like your issue with Eclipse and PyDev might have been resolved by updating the Maven plugins, but it's not entirely clear why that would have solved the problem. Let's rephrase and organize your description to make it more coherent and professional.

**Issue Description:**

I encountered an issue with Eclipse where the editor stalled, but the menu was still functional. I closed Eclipse normally through the menu. Upon reopening, I received the following error:

```
Plug-in org.python.pydev was unable to load class org.python.pydev.editor.PyEdit.
```

**Environment Details:**
- **Eclipse Version:** Kepler Release 2 (Build id: 20140224-0627)
- **Java Version:** Java 8
- **PyDev Version:** Initially 4.5.4.20160129223, then updated to PyDev 5

**Steps Taken:**
- Rebuilt the workspace
- Cleaned the workspace
- Restarted Eclipse
- Updated PyDev to version 5

Despite these steps, the error persisted. Additionally, the Package Explorer also failed to load, displaying the following error:

```
Plug-in org.eclipse.jdt.ui was unable to load class org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.packageview.PackageExplorerPart.
```

**Exact Traceback:**

```
org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Plug-in org.python.pydev was unable to load class org.python.pydev.editor.PyEdit.

```

**Resolution:**

Surprisingly, the issue was resolved after updating the Maven plugins. Although it is not immediately clear why this update would affect the loading of the PyDev and JDT UI classes, it did solve the problem.

If anyone has a similar issue, you may want to try updating your Maven plugins as a potential solution.
