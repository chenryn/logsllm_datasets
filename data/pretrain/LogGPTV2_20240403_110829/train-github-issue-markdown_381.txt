**How to get the current entry point's name from within a loader?**
It is needed for a customized `file-loader` that uses
`loaderUtils.interpolateName` by default which obviously interpolates the
`[name]` to the currently required file name.
In `extract-text-webpack-plugin` the `[name]` is interpolated to the **entry
point name** and that's what I'm for in the customized `file-loader` _(the
purpose of which is to aid in toggling source-maps for`.less` files depending
on current environment)_
Hence the question. Thanks.
