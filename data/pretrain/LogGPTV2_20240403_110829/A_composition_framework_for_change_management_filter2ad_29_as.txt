A variety of tools and methods should be employed at the conclusion of each 
training session and/or afer implementation to identify gaps in the Knowledge 
Evaluation and Transfer of Learning categories. The following methods are ways 
that this can be accomplished: 
•  Training Efectiveness Survey: The Training Efectiveness Survey provides 
an opportunity for course participants to evaluate their training experiences 
in areas such as usefulness and relevance. The template contains a series of 
statements which the training participant can use to rate his/her experience 
of the training. 
• 
This survey is generally used to collect feedback on individual courses and 
can  be  given  in  hard  copy  form  or  electronically  to  collect  and  evaluate 
data from the Training Efectiveness Survey to identify patterns and gaps, 
generate metrics, and plan the need for future training opportunities. 
Feedback  from  Training  Instructors/Facilitators/Coaches:  Training 
instructors, facilitators, and coaches provide unique insight into the results 
and efectiveness of the training program. These individuals are intimately 
familiar with the objectives, content, and participants and can, therefore, 
identify topics of concern and areas which participants could benefit from 
additional training. They also are an excellent resource to identify strategies 
to  address  any  identified  training  gaps  and  needs.  This  feedback  can  be 
collected through informal one-on-one communications, or collected from 
a group through a facilitated session. 
•  End  User  Performance  of  New  System:  How  end  users  use  the  new 
solution is a good indicator of gaps in the Transfer of Learning category. 
Users who are not able to perform their new job functions or who struggle 
with navigating and using the new system can be identified when collecting 
performance data. Potential data points may include: number of help desk 
calls, time to complete a certain task, and the lack of end users using the 
new  system.  It  is  important  to  collect  and  monitor  this  data  in  order  to 
identify where training needs may still exist. 
Using  the  above  methods,  the  training  resources  working  with  the  OCM 
Practitioner can identify gaps that afect the new system performance. By 
doing this it can be determined on how to address these gaps with refresher 
training opportunities.

Coordinate Development and Delivery of  
Ongoing Training 
The ongoing training process should follow the guidelines set forth in the Training 
Plan. This efort includes both refresh training, which addresses training gaps, 
and new hire training, which provides training opportunities to new employees. 
The training resources working with the OCM Practitioner needs to determine 
the level of efort, responsibility, and timeline for: 
•  Training material updates 
•  Quality assurance (e.g., training material and training efectiveness) 
•  Material storage 
•  Training delivery and management 
The Training Plan should be used to identify and determine the best course for 
delivering ongoing training. For more information on planning, developing, and 
delivering  training,  review  the  Training  section  within  the  Executing  Process 
Phase chapter. Also consider: 
•  How many end users will need access to refresh or new hire training?  
If there is small number of end users expected to need refresh or new 
hire training, the OCM Practitioner may include a more informal process 
using one-on-one coaching delivery method. If refresh and new hire 
training needs are extensive, the OCM Practitioner may consider eLearning 
methods where content is available on demand in addition to the ongoing 
delivery of the training program documented in the Training Plan. 
•  What topics/areas should be included in refresh and new hire training?  
Training content will play a part in determining the extent of the ongoing 
training efort and delivery methods used. Multiple, complex topics may 
be best addressed in an instructor-led training efort, including classroom 
sessions or virtual classroom learning opportunities. Simple topics may 
be addressed with published help guides, job aids, or other tutorials. For 
refresh training, the OCM Practitioner should utilize the gaps in knowledge 
identified in training evaluation to determine the topics/areas of training. 
The  training  resources,  working  with  the  OCM  Practitioner,  should  continue 
to capture all training eforts during the Closing Process Phase in the Training 
Action Log that was started in the Executing Process Phase.

The objective of this chapter is to provide OCM Practitioners with supplementary 
resources that are useful for understanding, coordinating, and planning an OCM 
efort.  Additionally,  the  chapter  provides  material  helpful  to  understanding 
the relationship between the California Project Management Framework (CA-
PMF),  California  Organizational  Change  Management  Framework  (CA-OCM), 
and California Business Process Reengineering Framework (CA-BPR) over the 
Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC). 
1.1  Introduction 
The CA-OCM is a practical guide to help the OCM Practitioner and project team 
successfully manage an OCM efort. This chapter introduces useful resources 
that give the OCM Practitioner additional information about elements of the 
CA-OCM and how it ties to other related State of California frameworks, such 
as the CA-PMF. This chapter also includes references to OCM-related resources 
that the OCM Practitioner or those involved in an OCM efort can use to further 
their knowledge. 
The OCM Practitioner can refer to or use these resources at any point throughout 
the project; however, these may be particularly useful during project planning 
to help provide context for the activities. The multiple illustrations presented 
provide context around and promote coordination with project management 
and BPR.
