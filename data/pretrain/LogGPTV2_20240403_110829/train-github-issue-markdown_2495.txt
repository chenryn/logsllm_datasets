I am creating this so I can pin it & to help keep track of several related
issues/work-items.
## Things we know:
  * The grab handles are bright white/accent color/dark black
  * The grab handles are too narrow / the borders are too thick / why can't I use the area outside the window frame to resize?
  * #994 Split panes need an indicator to show which is focused
  * #1000 Literally anything having to do with panes
  * Click/Right click icon should display Minimize/Maximize/Close menu
  * When you click `Cascade Windows` , `Show windows stacked` etc is completely ignored by Terminal
  * #376, #545 Commandline applications can't receive mouse input
  * #4980 system theme light = light borders, even if terminal theme dark
  * The title bar isn't acrylic, but now since architectural changes _could_ be!
## Things related to tabs:
  * #1625 Has another giant bucket of work that's more specific to the non-client area (where the tabs are)
  * The area above the tabs isn't draggable
  * Can't pop/drag out tabs
  * Can't reorder tabs
  * #597 Without using tabs don't shrink/expand like browser tabs / I want to set a min width for my tabs / I want a fixed width for my tabs / I want tabs to expand to split the available space / any other possible tab sizing]
  * #3300 Tab bar doesn't grow when you resize the window, it only shrinks (Regressed in v0.6)
## Things that people want, but we _won't_ be able to fix:
  * #1753 Can only set "Opacity" of acrylic, not "Blur" / Can't have a non-acrylic transparency
## Things fixed in v0.6:
  * #2513 Double click to non-client area should maximize the Window.
  * #771 The default 'active' tab contrast is very low (especially light mode)
  * The tabs don't look as good as you'd like #702

  * #857 When the window is smaller than the sum of the width of the tabs, the tabs are cut off, without indication to scroll
## Things fixed in v0.5:
  * #1589 Alt+F4 doesn't close the Window (PR#2526)
## Things fixed in v0.3:
  * The non-client area looks wrong; PR #929, Issue #872

  * #564 draggable area in title bar (PR #1948)
  * When maximized on displays with a different DPI, the edges of the window are cut off. (Fixed by #1921)
  * #608 _the text of my tabs is too long_
  * I'm using the dark theme but am still seeing a white border and header are still white. (Might be fixed by #929)

  * Resizing the window causes the UI to disapper/reappear.
