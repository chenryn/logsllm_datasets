I am experiencing an issue with the TypeScript 1.7.6.0 text editor in Visual Studio 2015, where it no longer responds to keyboard inputs for numbers and letters. However, the Tab and Enter keys still function as expected.

This problem occurred unexpectedly, and I did not notice when exactly it began. To resolve the issue, I have already reset the Visual Studio settings and restarted my computer, but the text editor remains unresponsive.

Could you please assist me in troubleshooting this problem? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
