Text editor for typescript 1.7.6.0 in visual studio 2015 can not response to
keyboard inputs (numbers and words, but tab/enter still work).  
It just happened. I even have not notice when it happened. I have reset vs
settings and also restart the computer. It's still dead. Please help to check.
Thanks in advance.
