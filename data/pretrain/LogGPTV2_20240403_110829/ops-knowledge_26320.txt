User: I use grep to parse through my trading apps logs, but it's limited in the sense that I need to visually trawl through the output to see what happened etc.
I'm wondering if Perl is a better option? Any good resources to learn log and string parsing with Perl?
I'd also believe that Python would be good for this. Perl vs Python vs 'grep on linux'?
Assistant: on linux, you can use just the shell(bash,ksh etc) to parse log files if they are not too big in size. The other tools to go for are usually grep and awk. However, for more programming power, awk is usually used. If you have big files to parse, try awk.
Of course, Perl or Python or practically any other languages with file reading and string manipulation capabilities can be used as well.
