### Wachovia Bank and Money Laundering Scandal

**Date:** Monday, July 05, 2010

Wachovia Bank, now owned by Wells Fargo, recently reached a settlement with federal prosecutors over allegations that it facilitated the laundering of more than $378 billion by drug cartels through exchange houses in Mexico from 2004 to 2007. This violation is considered the largest breach of the Bank Secrecy Act in U.S. history.

Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $160 million in fines and penalties, which represents less than 2% of its 2009 profits. If the agreed amount is paid, the Justice Department will drop all related charges by March of the following year. According to Bloomberg News, no major U.S. bank, including Wells Fargo, has ever been indicted for violating the Bank Secrecy Act or any other federal law. Instead, the Justice Department typically resolves such criminal charges through deferred prosecution agreements, where the bank pays a fine and commits to not breaking the law again.

Some of the laundered funds were used to purchase DC-9 planes for smuggling drugs into Mexico. However, Wachovia was not the only financial institution involved. The aircraft purchases also relied on funds moved through Bank of America. Additionally, American Express Bank International in Miami has been fined twice for failing to detect drug money passing through its accounts.

### Western Union and Money Laundering

In February, Western Union, a company that facilitates wire transfers, agreed to pay $94 million to settle investigations by Arizona’s attorney general regarding money laundering. These activities highlight the widespread nature of the problem, as not just banks but also non-bank financial institutions have been implicated.

### Jyske Bank Fined for Money Laundering

**Date:** Monday, May 17, 2010

Jyske Bank, a Danish financial institution, was fined 1.7 million euros by Spanish financial authorities for violating Spain's money laundering regulations. The violations occurred at Jyske Bank's division in Gibraltar, where Spanish authorities claim they were denied access to crucial information. The bank was cited for failing to report transactions properly, unwillingness to investigate certain transactions, and having inadequate control procedures. This is the first time a Danish bank has been fined for violating another country’s money laundering rules.

### Vatican Bank and Money Laundering Allegations

**Date:** January 25, 2011

The Vatican Bank, officially known as the Instituto per le Opere di Religione (IOR), has come under scrutiny for money laundering. Italian authorities flagged a 23 million euro transfer from an IOR account for lacking required information under EU anti-money laundering laws. As a result, the funds were seized, the IOR account was frozen, and an investigation was launched.

The IOR, while not a traditional bank, serves as a fund deposit and transfer institution. It does not lend money or act as a business consultant but operates in currency, bond markets, and gold trading. The exact value of its holdings is unclear, but it is often reported to have around 5 billion euros in deposits. The IOR's secrecy, with accounts identified only by numbers, has been exploited for illicit purposes, including money laundering for Italian politicians and mafia bosses.

### UBS and Money Laundering Investigation

A banker from UBS’s wealth management group was one of 19 people arrested by Brazilian police in connection with an anti-money laundering investigation. The investigation also targeted Credit Suisse and AIG, a U.S. insurer. UBS confirmed that a Swiss employee in its wealth management and business banking division had been detained. The alleged scheme allowed Brazilian companies to avoid taxes by laundering money through Swiss banks and the U.S. insurance group.

### Barclays, UBS, HSBC, and RBS Involved in Nigerian Money Laundering

**Date:** October 13, 2010

Barclays, HSBC, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, and NatWest have been linked to a money laundering scam involving corrupt Nigerian politicians. A report by Global Witness, a non-governmental organization, accused these banks of facilitating corruption in Nigeria. The report states that between 1999 and 2005, the banks received millions of pounds from two former governors accused of corruption but failed to sufficiently investigate the sources of the funds.

### Impact on Security Professionals

The focus on attacks and the sensationalism surrounding them can overshadow the need for effective defensive strategies. Security professionals are frustrated with the industry's emphasis on offensive tactics and the lack of attention to developing robust defensive measures. The ongoing cycle of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) perpetuates the problem, making it difficult to achieve acceptable levels of information security.
