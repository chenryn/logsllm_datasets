Wachovia bank recently reached an agreement with federal prosecutors to settle 
charges that it allowed drug cartels to launder more than $378 billion through 
exchange houses it owned in Mexico from 2004 to 2007. Wachovia, now owned by 
Wells Fargo, was found to have committed the largest violation of the Bank Secrecy 
Act in U.S. history. 
Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $160 million in fines and penalties, which 
represents less than 2% of its 2009 profits. If Wells Fargo does pay the amount agreed 
upon, the Justice Department will drop all related charges next March. According to 
Bloomberg News, “No big U.S. bank--Wells Fargo included--has ever been indicted 
22 
for violating the Bank Secrecy Act or any other federal law. Instead, the Justice 
Department settles criminal charges by using deferred-prosecution agreements, in 
which a bank pays a fine and promises not to break the law again.” 
Some of the laundered drug money was used to buy DC-9 planes to 
smuggle drugs into Mexico. But Wachovia wasn’t the only bank to allow illicit funds to 
move through its accounts. The aircraft purchases also relied on monies that moved 
through Bank of America. And American Express Bank International in Miami has 
twice been fined for failing to detect drug money filtering through its accounts. 
Not just banks have profited from drug cartel money. In February, Western Union, 
which transfers money by wire, agreed to pay $94 million to settle investigations by 
Arizona’s attorney general. 
They were laundering money equal to one third of the GDP of Mexico yet claimed 
that no one noticed.

when I sent the DMs I assumed that since they were in the clear with 
no anonymization they were already being hoovered up by the illegal 
NSA/AT&T internet tap in SF.  They already had all this data.  This

Not just American banks of course: 
Jyske Bank fined for laundering  
Monday, 17 May 2010 
Danish bank 
Possible conflicts in banking regulations between Gibraltar and Spain have led to a 
considerable fine for Jyske Bank, according to bank management 
Spanish financial authorities have issued Jyske Bank a 1.7 million euro fine for violating 
the country’s money laundering regulations, reports Jyllands-Posten newspaper. 
Activities at Jyske Bank’s division in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar are at 
issue in the case, where the Spanish authorities assert they have been denied access to 
vital information. 
23 
In the decision to fine the bank, the violations were described as ‘very serious’ and Jyske 
Bank in Gibraltar was cited for failure to properly report, unwillingness to investigate 
certain transactions, and having inadequate control procedures. 
It is the first time a Danish bank has been fined for violations of another country’s money 
laundering rules. 
Unmasking the Vatican's bank 
Jan 25 2011 
ROME, Italy — When Pope Benedict XVI makes lofty statements about the role ethics 
plays in the economy, he speaks from experience. 
Within the Vatican is the only branch of the Instituto per le Opere di Religione (IOR), 
otherwise known as the Vatican bank. Its ATM uses Latin. 
Only Vatican employees and religious institutions are allowed to open accounts in the 
bank — which you’d think would make it the most moral bank in the world. 
So why is its chief, economist Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, under investigation for money 
laundering? 
Italy's Central Bank flagged a 23 million euro transfer from an IOR account in an Italian 
bank, the Credito Artigiano, to two other accounts as lacking some information now 
compulsory under EU-mandated anti-money laundering laws. So prosecutors seized the 
money, froze the IOR account, and opened an investigation. 
This embarrassing “misunderstanding” — as the Vatican called it in a note published in 
its newspaper, l'Osservatore Romano — managed to turn the spotlight again on an 
institution that has been involved in many murky affairs. 
“The IOR is not a bank in the normal definition of the term,” wrote Vatican spokesman 
Federico Lombardi in a recent letter to the Financial Times. In fact, it doesn't lend money 
or act as a consultant to businesses. 
“It is more a fund deposit and transfer institution than a bank,” said Carlo Marroni, a 
Vatican expert with Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's financial daily. IOR doesn't invest in the stock 
market, he thinks, “though they operate on the currency or bond market, or buy gold.” To 
trade in world markets it must go through other banks, such as the Credito Artigiano. 
It is hard to pin down the value of IOR’s holdings. “It doesn't publish a budget or an 
annual report,” Marroni said. “It is usually held that it has 5 billion euros in deposits, but 
I don't know how exact this figure is.” 
24 
Another often reported figure is that accounts turn a 13 percent yearly interest — tax-
free, like the Vatican itself. 
But, “I think it's much less than that,” said Marroni. A leaked document from 1987 
published in a recent book that made headlines here, “Vaticano Spa” — Spa being the 
acronym for publicly traded companies in Italian — showed that an IOR account yielded 
a 9 percent net interest. 
IOR's biggest asset, anyway, is its secrecy — all its accounts are identified only by 
number. This secrecy has been used for unholy goals. 
Some of them have been documented in full. The author of “Vaticano Spa,” Gianluigi 
Nuzzi, gained access to the archive left by the late Monsignor Renato Dardozzi, a key 
player at IOR from 1974 to the late 1990s. He used it to investigate the bank's 
involvement in money-laundering for Italian politicians and even mafia bosses. In a letter 
published by Nuzzi, the previous president of the Vatican Bank, Angelo Caloia, 
confessed worriedly to cardinal Angelo Sodano, John Paul II's “prime minister,” 
that IOR had served to “clean” bribes and that it held ciphered accounts for 
Catholic politicians, such as seven-time prime minister Giulio Andreotti. 
When Banco Ambrosiano head Roberto Calvi, know as “God's Banker,” died under 
Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982, the Vatican Bank was then the main shareholder 
of the Banco. 
The American head of IOR at the time, Illinois-born cardinal Paul Casimir 
Marcinkus, a former body guard to Pope Paul VI, resorted to Vatican immunity to 
avoid prosecution by Italian judges. He died in 2006 and has often been blamed for the 
scandals that plagued the bank in the 1980s. 
UBS remains strongly committed to promoting the development and implementation of 
anti-money laundering (AML) standards for the financial industry as a whole, thereby 
contributing to wider efforts against money laundering. As an example of this, UBS was 
one of the driving forces behind the launch of the Wolfsberg Group, which issued its first 
global AML principles in 2000.

A banker from UBS’ wealth management group was one of 19 people arrested by 
Brazilian police last night in connection with an anti-money laundering investigation that 
is also targeting the rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse and AIG, the US insurer.  
UBS confirmed that a Swiss employee in its wealth management and business banking 
division had been detained.  
It said that the bank was looking into the matter but declined to name the banker 
concerned or comment further.  
The arrest was made during an investigation into an alleged scheme that allowed 
Brazilian companies to avoid taxes by laundering money through Swiss banks and the US 
insurance group, a detective from Brazil’s federal police said.  
Clariden Leu, a private banking subsidiary of Credit Suisse, confirmed that one of its 
employees had also been detained. Credit Suisse decline to comment.  
In a statement, a federal judge named UBS, Credit Suisse and AIG as the financial 
institutions under investigation.  
AIG said that it was “not aware of any wrongdoing by any AIG employee”.

Barclays, UBS, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland Involved in Money Laundering for 
Corrupt Nigerian Politicians 
October 13, 2010  
Barclays, HSBC, UBS, others ‘fuel corruption in Nigeria’  
Barclays, HSBC, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS – have 
been linked to money laundering scam over which some corrupt 
Nigerian politicians were indicted. 
A report entitled ‘International Thief’ from Global Witness, a Non-
Governmental Organisation (NGO) that exposes the corrupt exploitation 
of natural resources and international trade systems, drives campaigns to 
end impunity, resource-linked conflict, and human rights and 
environmental abuses, accused the banks of fueling corruption in the 
world’s most-populous black nation. 
In a 40-page report published yesterday in www.globalwitness.org, Global 
Witness said that the five banks had taken millions of pounds between 
1999 and 2005 from two former governors accused of corruption 
(Diepreye Alamieyeseigha of Bayelsa State and Joshua Dariye of Plateau 
26 
State), but had failed sufficiently to investigate the customers or the source 
of their funds. 
WHISTLE-BLOWERS AND TEAM-PLAYERS (see excerpts from my column on the 
subject below) 
Either one counts on a CONTEXT that supports “truth-telling” or one has to build a 
context in which one can find trusted colleagues and tell the truth in a small group and 
develop strategies based on that truth and commitment. PRIVACY IS NOT AN ISSUE 
FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. THAT FOCUS IS RED HERRING. SECURE 
COMMUNICATIONS AMONG TRUSTED COLLEAGUES IS THE ISSUE. (See: 
Tunisia, Iran, Egypt, Syria for recent examples.) 
In my last conversation with Gary Webb, I asked if his work on “Dark Alliance” was 
worth it. He said: 
Was it worth it? Yes. The CIA admitted it. I know it was the truth, and that’s what 
kept me going. I knew I was right.  
My eyes were wide open. I knew what I was getting into. The kids suffered. I had 
the paper behind me – I thought. Support came from all sorts of places. Especially 
African Americans.  My wife was OK with it. She was used to me getting death 
threats. 
You get one chance in a lifetime to do the right thing. If you don’t do it, you 
surrender, and then they win.  These are the worst people on earth that you’re 
dealing with – they lie, plant stories, discredit and worse for a living and have the 
resources and the experience. But somebody’s got to do it. Otherwise they win. 
When he killed himself, I thought of this late-night conversation. Who in fact won?  
Since 9/11 the Media Complex has hammered at the loss of under 3000 lives as a 
criminal act justifying a global response that included  torture as a standard 
methodology, numerous wars and special forces activities, and the hoovering of 
American comms without warrants. The cartel wars have cost more than 35,000 
lives and some of the banks named above are complicit in their murders.  That you 
can read it here is an example of how free speech functions as a bleeder valve, so 
long as it does not lead to action. If it leads to action – e.g. MLK Junior, Malcolm X, 
Fred Hampton, etc. – it is not tolerated so easily. 
[Casa de Cambios, NAFTA, 22,000 Dead  by Kathleen Miller - August 4th 2010 
     Law enforcement officials often suggest money laundering is too complex a 
process for the average person to understand. Factor in an understandable concern 
27 
that interfering, even from afar, in the business of big banking could always affect 
one’s own bottom-line, and you can see why reports of financial crimes do not 
receive the same attention, in the press, from the public or the government, as say, 
Lindsay Lohan’s sentencing for too many DUIs.  
What we need perhaps is a simpler view of how the US-Mexico banking relationship 
supports transnational crime and how that relationship is nourished and sustained 
by NAFTA. We also need to understand what part  the wire transmitting operations 
know as “Casa de Cambios” (CDCs) play, and why, in the case of Wachovia’s laundering 
of millions in dirty dollars, these CDCs have been so critical to success.  
NAFTA, which created a unified trade bloc, also created a transnational financial bloc. 
During the last two decades, foreign institutions have been binging on a menu of mergers 
and acquisitions, acquiring significant interest and, in some cases, outright control of 
banks and other financial services providers in Mexico. 
Large, powerful US banks like Wachovia, Bank of America, American Express, 
Citigroup, Spain’s BBVA and London-based HSBC have been setting up shop in a nation 
burdened by a $39 billion per annum illegal drug industry, a history of corruption in both 
the private and public sectors, and ongoing civil unrest spawned by the quest for criminal 
control of Mexico’s drug trade. 
One important result is an opportunity for cash to move unimpeded from Mexico’s casa 
de cambios to their accounts in Mexican banks, and then to correspondent accounts in US 
banks. Drugs move from Mexico into the U.S., and drug money then moves south, 
through Mexico, and back to the U.S. or wherever the trafficker wants his ‘clean’ money 
to land.] 
February 7, 2009 (LPAC) In the mid-1990s, George Soros reportedly gave a $50 
million personal loan to the Colombia financiers, the brothers Gilinski -- Jaime and 
Isaac Gilinski, to support their takeover of the Banco de Colombia, which had been 
privatized. Soros reportedly gained about a 9% interest in that bank. The Gilinskis were 
majority owners of Banco de Colombia for about three years, then sold it, but may have 
retained a minority interest. Soros may have invested more in the bank after the 
Galinskis moved out of control. 
On October 4, 2000, PBS interviewer Juan Williams spoke with Carlos Toro, a 
childhood friend of Colombian drug cartel leader Carlos Lehder. Toro was an 
informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency who helped put Lehder and others in jail, 
and then went into the Witness Protection Program. 
"MR. TORO: The Colombian banking industry and also Colombian banks that had 
subsidiaries in Miami and Panama working very closely with us. 
28 
"In those days...we had Colombian banks, Banco De Colombia, Banco 
[unintelligible], Banco Cafetero [ph], Eagle National Bank of Miami. We were allies. 
In those days--and maybe Steve knows how Eagle National Bank was a powerful aid 
for us between 1980 and 1984. 
"MR. WILLIAMS: But the cartel did not own the bank. It was simply allied with 
the cartel. 
"MR. TORO: The cartel didn't own the bank in front of FDIC, but we own the 
bank...." 
In 2003, the Lubavitcher organization at Harvard University held a ceremony honoring 
the same Jaime Gilinski of Cali, Colombia, because he gave the money to build their 
headquarters; Alan Dershowitz spoke at the same or another ceremony honoring Gilinski, 
saying Gilinski's action would work against anti-semitism at Harvard. The Lubavitcher 
introducing Gilinski called him "the leader of Jewish communities throughout Latin 
America." 
On March 31, 2005, the Federal Reserve issued a cease and desist order to the Eagle 
National Holding Co. Of Miami, Florida, owner of Eagle National Bank of Miami, 
banning transactions between the company and other financial organizations 
controlled by the holding company's chairman, Jaime Gilinski; the Galinski 
companies are controlled by a trust owned by the Gilinski family. 
WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON SERIOUS WELL-INTENTIONED SECURITY 
PROFESSIONALS?

One security professional noted after Def Con 2010, “there are a lot of neat stories out of 
DefCon/BH this year.  But they all seemed to revolve around: 
- Attacks are sexy 
- The sky is continuing to fall 
I saw very few defensive technologies and techniques being presented.  I don't recall 
reading about _anything_ defensive in the press.  some stats about attacks, but that just 
paints a picture of how bad things are. GSM attacks, ATM attacks, social media attacks, 
etc all got many write-ups.  Honestly, I can't recall reading anything about defense.  
I'm pretty frustrated with the state of the industry right now.  Finding a single vuln will 
get you on national news.  Selling the same defensive tech for 20 years makes you a ton 
29 
of money.  Finding ways to actually deal with the fact that orgs are getting 0wned 
every day by ppl who are clearly targeting specific access is met with a test pattern. 
Another said the seemingly obvious:  
“The attack is sexy. Publicizing the attack is sexy and can perpetuate the FUD cycle as 
well.  :( 
IMHO the focus is still on "stuff" to be placed on top of a flawed underlying foundation.  
Ergo we never can really get to 'acceptable' levels of infosec unless either we a) rip out
