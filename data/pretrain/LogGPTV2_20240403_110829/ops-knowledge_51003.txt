User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows Server 2012 Drives Not Mapping After ISP Change Im new to setting up servers, Ive been reading my guide books but recently I ran into a problem that I can not solve. I work for a company with a small network  and they decided to change the ISP provider. Now the network drives will not map on the client machines using the script I created in the GP. Im running windows server 2012 as a DC, Im installed AD DS, DHCP, DNS, and File and Storage Services all on this one DC.
These are the error messages I am receiving on the servers dashboard

AD DS Errors


10020 Warning Microsoft-Windows-DHCP-Server
2089 Warning Microsoft-Windows-ActiveDirectory_DomainService
2213 Warning DFSR DFS Replication 
1400 Error ADWS Active Directory Web Services
2886 Warning Microsoft-Windows-ActiveDirectory_DomainService
4013 Warning Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service
1202 Error ADWS Active Directory web service 


DCHP Errors


10020 Warning Microsoft-Windows-DHCP-Server
1059 Error Microsoft-Windows-DHCP-Server


DNS Errors


4013 Warning Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service 


I tried to change the ip address in DHCP management and that didn't work I also tried to change the DNS settings.

Assistant: It sounds to me like you may have changed the DNS settings on the server and it cannot communicate with Active Directory. Set the Primary DNS server on the servers NIC to 127.0.0.1 (the loopback address - the sever itself) and leave the secondary blank as in the following image:

DNS settings

In DHCP management, under Scope options ensure that the DNS Server is set to the internal IP of the server, and router is set to the internal IP address of the ISP router. Restart the DNS and then the DHCP services and check for errors in the logs. Hopefully that resolves the internal connectivity issues.

If you then have internet issues you can set the DNS forwarders to the DNs servers provided by the ISP as per https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754941.aspx.

I hope that helps resolve the issues.
