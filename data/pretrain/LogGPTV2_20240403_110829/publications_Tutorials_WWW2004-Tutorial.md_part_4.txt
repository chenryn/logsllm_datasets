Semantic Annotation of Web
Services
Annotation of Web Services
To enhance the discovery, composition, and
orchestration of Web services, it is necessary to increase
the description of their interfaces.
One solution is to annotate WSDL interfaces with
semantic metadata based on relevant ontologies.
An ontology is a specification of a representational vocabulary
for a shared domain of discourse.
117
118
How to Annotate ?
Map Web service’s input & output data as well as
functional description using relevant data and
function/operation ontologies, respectively
How ?
Borrow from schema matching
Semantic disambiguation between terms in XML
messages represented in WSDL and concepts in
ontology

UDDI
UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery and
Integration
UDDI serves as a “Business and services” registry and
directory and are essential for dynamic usage of Web
services
A UDDI registry is similar to a CORBA trader, or it can
be thought of as a DNS for business applications.
Is a platform-independent framework for describing
services, discovering businesses, and integrating
business services by using the Internet.

1 Entry for multiple supplier quotes on all building materials
Categorization suggested for UDDI is useful but inadequate

Benefits Web Service
Discovery
Search engines can better “understand” the

More accurate searches
Additional information aids precision
Makes it possible to automate searches

Semantic Discovery: Overview
Annotation and Publication
WSDL file is annotated using ontologies and the annotations
are captured in UDDI
Discovery
Requirements are captured as templates that are
constructed using ontologies and semantic matching is done
against UDDI entries
Functionality of the template, its inputs, outputs, preconditions and
effects are represented using ontologies
Use of ontologies
brings service provider and service requestor to a common
conceptual space
helps in semantic matching of requirements and
specifications
138
139
Semantic Publication and Discovery
Use of ontologies enables
shared understanding
between the service provider
and service requestor
For simplicity of depicting, the ontology is shown with classes for both operation and data 139

Discovery
The Match Function
The Web service discovery and integration
process is carried out by a key operation:
The match function.
The matching step is dedicated to finding
correspondences between a service template (ST,
i.e., a query) and a service object (SO).
