Subject: Investigation and Resolution of Worker Loss Errors

Hello,

I recently investigated an unusual error affecting one of our tasks. We were consistently receiving the following error message, indicating that workers were being lost:

```
Task (...)[5832c7bd-fe9d-45cd-865e-b6beb4c09e47] raised unexpected: WorkerLostError('Worker exited prematurely: signal 15 (SIGTERM).',)
```

Initially, I searched for other processes that might have been terminating our workers, but the system logs did not provide any relevant information. Just as I was about to conclude my investigation, we disabled autoscaling due to unrelated issues. Surprisingly, this action completely resolved the errors.

For your reference, here are the versions of the relevant software components:
- Celery: 3.1.18
- Django: 1.7.8
- librabbitmq: 1.6.1

If you have any further questions or need additional details, please let me know.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
