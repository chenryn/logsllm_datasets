Hello,
I was investigating strange error which we have for one of our tasks. We
received regular errors about billard losing workers:
    Task (...)[5832c7bd-fe9d-45cd-865e-b6beb4c09e47] raised unexpected: WorkerLostError('Worker exited prematurely: signal 15 (SIGTERM).',)
I was searching for some other processes which could killed our workers but
system logs was empty and when I was going to give up we turned off autoscale
due to some other issues and these errors dissapered completely.
Celery 3.1.18  
Django 1.7.8  
librabbitmq 1.6.1
