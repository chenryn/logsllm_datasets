### Title: Botconf 2018 - Leaving No Stone Unturned: In Search of HTTP Malware Distinctive Features

#### Abstract:
When analyzing Command and Control (C&C) network traffic, we frequently encounter the use of the HTTP protocol. The messages in this traffic can be either obfuscated or sent as plain text, and they are often designed to mimic legitimate web browser traffic. However, in many cases, these messages are generated using standard libraries and tools. This raises the question: are there distinct features that can help differentiate between malware-generated HTTP requests and those from benign applications?

In our presentation, we will share the results of our comprehensive analysis aimed at identifying such distinctive features. We examined various aspects, including:

- **Header Appearance**: Misspellings, unusual names
- **Header Values**
- **General Payload Analysis**: Entropy, character distribution, etc.
- **Header Sequence Order**

Our dataset includes over 35,000 pcap files from CERT Polskaâ€™s sandbox environment and the Malware Capture Facility Project. These files encompass network traffic from approximately 190 different malware families, categorized into common types such as bankers, ransomware, downloaders, and spambots.

To identify distinctive features, we compared our findings against the HTTP traffic from Alexa's top 500 most popular domains worldwide. The results were surprising, even to us.

#### Key Points:
- **Non-Academic Presentation**: Our goal is to provide practical insights that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
- **Comparative Analysis**: We will also compare our findings with traffic generated by popular Windows HTTP libraries and tools.
- **Interesting Examples**: We will highlight particularly intriguing examples of HTTP anomalies found in both malware and benign traffic.
