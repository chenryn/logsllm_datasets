User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Let's Encrypt for intranet websites? Many companies have intranet websites that are not reachable via the internet. Usually they just use a self-signed certificate, which causes a bad habit for the users since they get used to just pressing OK on invalid CERT warnings.

Question: How can they generate a certificate for their HTTPS websites using Let's Encrypt? Does the LTS web browsers have the Let's Encrypt as CA? 

Isn't it a privacy issue that private domain names, like my-company-private-intranet-site.com, could be leaked?

Assistant: Let's Encrypt can only issue certificates for valid DNS names. So if your intranet uses a made-up domain name like intranet.mycompany.local then it won't work.

If you have a real DNS name like intranet.mycompany.com (even if it doesn't resolve externally to your intranet), then you can use Let's Encrypt to issue certificates for it. If the domain does resolve externally to a server that can respond on port 80 (which need not actually be part of your intranet, if you have split-horizon DNS), you can use the http-01 challenge.

Alternatively, you can use the dns-01 challenge (fully supported in Certbot 0.10.0 and later, as well as other clients such as dehydrated, getssl and acme.sh). Since this challenge works by provisioning DNS TXT records, you don't ever need to point an A record at a public IP address.

So your intranet does not need to be reachable from the Internet, but your domain name does need to exist in the public DNS under your control.

Let's Encrypt - and publicly trusted certificate authorities in general, due to Chrome's requirements - submit all issued certificates to public certificate transparency logs. As such, you should not expect your intranet (sub)domain name to remain secret if you obtain a certificate for it. Your intranet's security shouldn't be dependent on keeping its domain name secret anyway.
