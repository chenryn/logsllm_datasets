ABSTRACT
Internet exchange points (IXPs) are an important ingredi-
ent of the Internet AS-level ecosystem—a logical fabric of
the Internet made up of about 30,000 ASes and their mutual
business relationships whose primary purpose is to control
and manage the ﬂow of traﬃc. Despite the IXPs’ critical
role in this fabric, little is known about them in terms of
their peering matrices (i.e., who peers with whom at which
IXP) and corresponding traﬃc matrices (i.e., how much traf-
ﬁc do the diﬀerent ASes that peer at an IXP exchange with
one another). In this paper, we report on an Internet-wide
traceroute study that was speciﬁcally designed to shed light
on the unknown IXP-speciﬁc peering matrices and involves
targeted traceroutes from publicly available and geograph-
ically dispersed vantage points. Based on our method, we
were able to discover and validate the existence of about
44K IXP-speciﬁc peering links—nearly 18K more links than
were previously known.
In the process, we also classiﬁed
all known IXPs depending on the type of information re-
quired to detect them. Moreover, in view of the currently
used inferred AS-level maps of the Internet that are known
to miss a signiﬁcant portion of the actual AS relationships
of the peer-to-peer type, our study provides a new method
for augmenting these maps with IXP-related peering links
in a systematic and informed manner.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet AS-level ecosystem is a network of networks,

if they have established a commercial relationship for fee-
based (i.e., customer-provider) or settlement-free (i.e., peer-
to-peer) traﬃc exchange.1 This logical construct is largely a
reﬂection of the prevailing economic conditions under which
the key Internet players (e.g., service providers, content pro-
viders, business enterprises, Internet Exchange Points) have
to operate. Understanding its structure and the main forces
that shape this structure and its temporal evolution have
been of great interest to networking researcher for some time
(see for example [1, 2] and references therein). However, de-
spite signiﬁcant eﬀorts, the Internet’s AS-level ecosystem
has remained an elusive object, mainly because of the vari-
ous shortcomings of the available measurements that under-
lie most inference work to date. Among those measurements,
the most commonly-used ones are either traceroute-based,
or derived from BGP table dumps, or obtained from In-
ternet Routing Registries or other publicly available data
bases. While recent studies agree on the adequateness of
a combination of these measurements for correctly inferring
the number of ASes and adequately discovering and iden-
tifying the vast majority of customer-provider links, they
all conclude that even the most carefully inferred AS maps
currently in use still miss a substantial portion of AS connec-
tions of the peer-to-peer type, with estimates varying from
35% up to 95% [3, 4, 5, 6].
The key contribution of this paper is a ﬂexible and eﬃ-
cient approach that sheds new light on the substrate of the
AS-level ecosystem that consists of all known IXPs, their
member ASes, and all the peerings among those members.2
This IXP substrate is a critical component of the economic
fabric of the Internet; IXPs are the physical infrastructures
managed by third parties where member ASes can choose
to peer with one another for the purpose of exchanging traf-
ﬁc directly and essentially for free rather than at a cost via
some upstream service providers. With a few exceptions [7,
8, 4, 5], this substrate has been largely neglected in past AS-
related studies. Our approach consists of launching targeted
traceroutes from systematically selected sources to carefully
chosen destination and checking the resulting paths for indi-
cations that they went through an IXP. It enables us to (i)
classify known IXPs in terms of the information and eﬀorts
needed to discover them, (ii) check the accuracy of published
IXP membership lists, and (iii) obtain for the IXPs we dis-
cover new insights into their unknown peering matrices; that

sibling-sibling) exist but are not found at IXPs.

336is, which member ASes peer with one another at these IXP.
It is these peering links that have consistently eluded pre-
vious inference eﬀorts and are the most diﬃcult to detect
using readily available traceroute datasets, BGP routing ta-
ble dumps, or other publicly available information. At the
same time, some recent papers [4, 5] have hypothesized that
these very links may hold the key to solving the missing links
problem for the AS-level Internet. Our work shows that this
hypothesis is indeed true—we discover and validate the ex-
istence of about 44K IXP-related peering links or roughly
75% more than any previous study has reported. Moreover,
our approach leaves little room for signiﬁcantly improving
our ﬁndings concerning the IXP substrate of the AS-level
ecosystem. And where there is room for improvements, we
provide details of the eﬀorts required to achieve them.
A critical diﬀerence between our work and existing large-
scale traceroute studies such as CAIDA’s Skitter [9] (and
its successor, Archipelago, or Ark) or the European Dimes
project [10] is our exclusive focus on the IXP substrate of
the AS-level Internet. Although an explicit goal of Skitter-
or Dimes-like eﬀorts has been the comprehensive mapping
of the AS-level Internet as a whole, there has been an in-
creasing awareness within the networking community of the
limitations of such a pursuit. The main issue is the quality
of the obtained measurements.
In addition to well-known
problems with traceroute (e.g., IP aliasing), the AS-level
ecosystem has a rich set of policies by which individual ASes
enforce the prevailing business agreements with their neigh-
bors and hence impact what traﬃc crosses their networks.
Given that most of the existing large-scale traceroute stud-
ies pay little attention to these issues, it should come as
no surprise that the resulting measurements are more a re-
ﬂection of what traceroute can measure than what these
studies would like the tool to measure. This motivates our
approach to stay clear of general-purpose traceroute exper-
iments and target instead the IXP substrate where the eco-
nomic conditions and routing policies are largely dominated
by settlement-free peering agreements. This insight can be
put to good use when trying to launch traceroutes between
selected source-destination hosts for the main purpose of
yielding useful information about the IXP substrate as a
whole and the IXP-speciﬁc peering matrices in particular.
However, as is the case with most AS-related results, val-
idation remains a serious challenge, and our work on the
IXP substrate is not diﬀerent. We use here some direct and
indirect methods to tackle this problem. In the case where
the ground truth is available (e.g., existence of IXPs), we
use various types of available information (e.g., data bases,
routing registries, web sites, search engines, private commu-
nications) to check for obvious inconsistencies between our
ﬁndings and published reports or known facts. Despite our
eﬀorts, we ﬁnd that 55 out of 278 detectable IXPs remain
undetected by our method. We explain why they remain in-
visible and detail the eﬀort and information needed to detect
them. In the case where the ground truth is not available
(e.g., IXP peering matrices3, we device a mechanism to ex-
press our conﬁdence in the validity of IXP-related peering
link discovered by our method.
In addition, for a few se-
lected IXPs, we provide some absolute and relative compar-

isons of the number of validated links we found. We ﬁnd that
our method represents a signiﬁcant improvement over past
eﬀorts, and while there may exist room for improvements,
they are only signiﬁcant (and require substantial more ef-
forts) if typical peering matrices are not sparse.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sec. 2 dis-
cusses related work, including two studies on which we build
on. Sec. 3 describes the key ingredients of the IXP substrate
of the AS-level ecosystem, reviews the use of traceroute, and
lists the various sources of data we rely on. Sec. 4 describes
the speciﬁcs of our methodology for mapping the IXP sub-
strate. The experiments and results are described in Sec. 5,
and the validation eﬀorts are summarized in Sec. 6. We con-
clude in Sec. 8 with some lessons learned from our traceroute
study and what they tell us about future AS-speciﬁc work.
2. RELATED WORK
The Internet research community’s interest in the AS-level
ecosystem started largely with the empirical observation re-
ported in [11] that the node degree distribution of inferred
AS graphs exhibit a power-law distribution. While this orig-
inal claim was based on BGP-based data, later eﬀorts such
as Skitter [9] or Dimes [10] that relied on data obtained
from large-scale traceroute experiments conﬁrmed this ﬁnd-
ing. AS topology modeling has become a very active re-
search area, largely dominated by novel graph-theoretic ap-
proaches aimed at developing mathematical graph models
capable of reproducing the observed power-law node degree
distributions and possibly other graph-based statistics (e.g.,
see [12] and references therein). However, at the same time,
there has been increasing evidence that the available BGP-
and traceroute-based measurements are of insuﬃcient qual-
ity to support claims of inferred power-law distributions (or
other commonly-used statistics) with any statistical signif-
icance. There has been a growing literature detailing the
issues and problems associated with relying on BGP- and
traceroute-based measurements for inferring AS-level con-
nectivity [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. These data hygiene eﬀorts have
led to an increasing awareness of the inadequacy or even
futility of the dominant graph-theoretic treatment of the
AS-level ecosystem and its almost exclusive focus on purely
topology-related properties. But, they have also highlighted
the need for alternative approaches to AS-level topology
modeling; such as accounting for the critical forces at work in
this economic fabric of the Internet and providing a deeper
understanding of how these forces shape the structure and
evolution of the AS-level ecosystem.
While Internet practitioners and network operators have
advanced this more economic-based perspective for some
time[18, 19, 20], the research community has been slow in
adopting this view and making it the focal point of further
AS-topology modeling. An early study[7] argued for aban-
doning the pure graph-theoretic treatment in favor of a more
economic-oriented approach, and pointed towards the need
for a more careful treatment of IXPs and their role in this
economic fabric. IXPs are a focal point of the study by Xu
et al. [8] and play again a signiﬁcant role in the recent work
by He et al. [21, 4]. In fact, [4] builds on the work by [8],
but overcomes some of its limitations and also signiﬁcantly
extends its scope. By proposing to shed new light on the
IXP substrate, our objective is similar to that of [8] and [4],
and our basic approach is similar to theirs, with noticeable
exceptions: our focus is on the IXP substrate and not on the
337AS-level ecosystem as a whole. Thus, any AS-related results
we obtain are by-products of our IXP-centric work. More
importantly, because of our exclusive focus on IXPs, we pro-
vide a more comprehensive and complete picture of the IXP
substrate; in fact, our results provide a detailed account of
the information and eﬀorts needed to discover and map each
and every IXP and illustrate the cost-beneﬁt trade-oﬀs as-
sociated with improving our IXP-related ﬁndings.
The IXP substrate of the AS-level Internet is an exam-
ple where no central agency exists that contains all rele-
vant information. However, since IXPs have in general eco-
nomic incentives to attract business, IXP-related informa-
tion is publicly available in various forms. Many IXPs have
a website where they provide basic information about their
location and facilities; basic architecture, fees, and services;
list of AS members and total daily traﬃc. Two projects
that systematically gather this information, augment it with
knowledge obtained through personal communications, and
make the resulting databases publicly available are Packet
Clearing House (PCH) and PeeringDB (PDB). While
these eﬀorts provide a great service to and are of enormous
value for the Internet community, because all of the infor-
mation is provided on a voluntary basis, the quality of these
databases in terms of the accuracy and/or freshness of the
data is unknown.4 Nevertheless, some key players within
the Internet’s AS-level ecosystem require interested parties
to ﬁrst enroll in Peeringdb before starting any discussion
about potential peerings [22]. At the same time, since IXPs
treat peering arrangements in general as proprietary infor-
mation, the actual peering matrices of the IXPs are not part
of these databases and have remained in general unknown.
IXPs rarely publish their peering matrices, and if they do,
they typically report inferred peerings; e.g., links between
the IXP and its members that have seen non-zero traﬃc
over some time interval in the recent past.
3. THE IXP SUBSTRATE
The IXP substrate of the Internet’s AS-level ecosystem
consists of all known IXPs, their member ASes, and all the
peerings among those members. We now describe the basic
features of this substrate and list the diﬀerent data sources
we rely on in our mapping eﬀort.
3.1 A typical IXP architecture
Most of today’s IXPs are composed of a layer-2 device,
usually an Ethernet switch 5, where IXP members can plug
in their access routers to interconnect directly with one an-
other.
IXPs typically deploy several redundancy mecha-
nisms to ensure high resilience of their physical infrastruc-
tures, but these layer-2 mechanisms remain by and large
invisible to IP.
Fig. 1 shows the typical architecture of an IXP. In this
example, the IXP has six members, each represented by a
router. When two members decide to peer, they just have
to establish a BGP session between their routers. Since this
requires that both routers have interfaces in the same IP
4For example, as of 5/5/09, the PDB entry for AMS-IX, a
major IXP in Amsterdam, had 257 members, compared to
the 312 members given on the AMS-IX website.
5A single active IXP (i.e., IXNM) supports ATM and Frame
Relay in addition to Ethernet, and based on personal com-
munication with PCH [23], all three planned eﬀorts to build
an MPLS-based IXP [24] have failed.

subnet, the IXP will assign an IP address to the IXP-facing
router interface of each of its members from the IP preﬁx(es)
allocated to the IXP by the Internet Registry responsible for
the IXP. In Fig. 1, these IXP-facing interface IP addresses
for AS1 and AS4 are denoted by @IXP1 and @IXP4, respec-
tively. This general practice is crucial for identifying IXPs
in a traceroute path.
3.2 Identifying IXPs in traceroute
The basic method to identify an IXP in a traceroute path
and infer properties such as peerings among IXP members
is described in [8] and has been reﬁned and signiﬁcantly
extended in [4]. Our approach relies and builds on these
earlier eﬀorts, and we brieﬂy summarize them here for com-
pleteness. Key to the method’s success is knowing the IXP
preﬁxes. To illustrate, consider again Fig. 1 and assume
we are interested in whether or not AS1 and AS4 peer at
this IXP. Suppose that launching a traceroute probe from a
source within AS1 to a destination in AS4 yields a sequence
of IP addresses that contains the following contiguous sub-
sequence: @AS1, @IXP4, and @AS4. If we know the IXP
