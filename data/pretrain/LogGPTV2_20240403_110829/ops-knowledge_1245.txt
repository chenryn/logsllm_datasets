User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题view external: query (cache) denied on bind9/named Is this an attack? I get a lot of :

Assistant: No that's no hack ;) Obviously Your DNS server isn't set up well. Try adding

nameserver 127.0.0.1

to DNS server's /etc/resolv.conf and add your subnet (192.168.0.0/24) to /etc/bind/named.conf


acl internals { 127.0.0.0/8; 192.168.0.0/24; };
