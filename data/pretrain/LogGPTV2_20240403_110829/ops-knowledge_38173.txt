User: Right now I'm testing the waters with Apache Thrift, and I'm currently using a TThreadedServer written in Python, but when I run the server, it is not daemonized. Is there any way to make it run as a daemon, or is there another way to run thrift in a production environment?
Assistant: I think you are looking for this:
nohup hbase thrift start &
This is the only way I found to keep thrift working after my disconnect from Linuxsession.
