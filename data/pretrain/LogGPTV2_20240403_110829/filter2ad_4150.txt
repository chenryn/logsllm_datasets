ABSTRACT
While sensor-enabled devices have greatly enriched human
interactions in our daily life, discovering the essential knowl-
edge behind sensing data is a critical issue to connect the
cyber world and the physical world. This motivates us to
design an innovative sensor-aided social network system,
termed cyber-physical handshake. It allows two users to nat-
urally exchange personal information with each other after
detecting and authenticating the handshaking patterns be-
tween them. This work describes our design of detection and
authentication mechanisms to achieve this purpose and our
prototype system to facilitate handshake social behavior.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, sensor-enabled mobile phones have become es-
sential tools in the study of cyber-physical systems (CPSs)
[1]. CPSs enrich the interactions between the virtual and
the physical worlds and sensor-aided social networking has
been recognized as one of the main CPS applications [2, 3].
This work designs an innovative sensor-aided social net-
work system, termed cyber-physical handshake, to enable
natural information exchange after detecting and authenti-
cating the handshaking patterns between two persons. In
the physical world, the handshake behavior between two
people implies that a social link will be authenticated be-
tween them before they exchange personal information (e.g.,
exchanges of business cards). On the other hand, in the cy-
ber world, a handshake procedure is adopted by two nodes
to authenticate each other before they start data exchanges.
The work follows the concept of “handshakes” to design an
authentication mechanism based on sensing patterns to fa-
cilitate automatic data exchanges between two users after
they have a handshake, as shown in Fig. 1. Instead of gen-
erating and authenticating shared keys [4, 5], our system is

watch).
2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The basic idea of the cyber-physical handshake system is
to allow two users to exchange data if they have a handshake
with each other. When two users make friends with a hand-
shake in the physical world, the shaking waves perceived by
the two users’ sensor nodes will have high degree of similar-
ity in both frequency and time domains. We then use the
similarities to authenticate a handshake behavior. Fig. 1
shows our system architecture. Each user is equipped with
a smart phone and wears a watch-like sensor node with an
accelerometer on his/her wrists. Sensor nodes follow IEEE
802.15.4 to communicate with each other. Each sensor node
is associated with its user’s smart phone through bluetooth.
Each sensor node is responsible for detecting and reporting
handshaking samples to its user’s smart phone. The smart
phone will compute a value of similarity between the two
users’ samples. If the value of similarity is greater than a
predeﬁned threshold, it will exchange the user’s E-card with
the other user over the Internet.

[7], and a battery, as shown in Fig. 3. Each OS5000 has a 3-
axes accelerometer. We set Rs=40Hz. Jennic JN5139 has a
micro-controller and a built-in 2.4GHz/IEEE802.15.4 wire-
less module. The user device is a smart phone (HTC Touch
2 [8]) with a bluetooth and a WiFi/3G wireless modules.
We also conduct experiments to log shaking waves of a
handshake event and a non-handshake event for 7 seconds.
Fig. 4 shows the experimental results, where the two users’
sensing data have high degree of similarity in a handshake
event in both frequency distribution and time domain sam-
ples.

Phase 1: handshake detection. In this phase, we use
each sensor node to detect shaking events. We sample data
at a rate of Rs. For each sample (cid:23), we check if the shaking
condition j(cid:23) (cid:0) 1gj > (cid:28)s holds, where g is the gravity and (cid:28)s
is a predeﬁned threshold. If the number of shaking samples
per second detected is greater than Rs=2, the sensor node
will broadcast a con(cid:12)rm shaking message and enter the next
phase.
Phase 2: handshake capture. In this phase, the sen-
sor node logs the upcoming N samples and checks if it has
received a con(cid:12)rm shaking message recently.
If so, it ex-
changes these N samples with that sensor node and then
reports all these samples to its smart phone.

Phase 3: pattern authentication. In this phase, each
smart phone will compute the values of similarity in both
frequency and time domains to decide whether the two sam-
ples are resulted from the same handshake in the physical
∫
world. First, we compute the value of similarity in the fre-
quency domain between two samples, say a and b, by Wf =

Paa(f )(cid:2)Pbb(f ) is the magni-

tude squared coherence of the two samples. Here, we only
consider the coherence between 0 (cid:24) 5 Hz because the hand-
shake frequency of a human can hardly exceed this range.
If Wf (cid:21) Tf , we have a handshake match and enter the next
phase, where Tf is a predeﬁned threshold. Otherwise, if Tf(cid:0)
Wf  Tt, a handshake is detected and
we enter phase 4, where Tt is a predeﬁned threshold.

In this phase, the user
device will inform its sensor node to exchange user’s email
address with the other sensor. Then it sends a personal
E-card to that address over the Internet for further social
networking behaviors.
