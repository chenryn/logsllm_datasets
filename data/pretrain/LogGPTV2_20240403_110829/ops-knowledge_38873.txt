Question: An application is designed to restrict file access within a certain directory. The developer has implemented a security control to filter out '../' sequences to prevent path traversal attacks. However, an attacker attempts to access files outside the restricted directory. Which of the following input sequences could potentially bypass the implemented security control and result in a path traversal vulnerability?
"A": "Using the sequence '.../...//' to collapse into '../'",
"B": "Employing the sequence '/././' to navigate within the current directory",
"C": "Applying the sequence '////' to denote the root directory",
"D": "Inserting the sequence '%2e%2e%2f' to perform URL-encoded traversal"
Answer: A
