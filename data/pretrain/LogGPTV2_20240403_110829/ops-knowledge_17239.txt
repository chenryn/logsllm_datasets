User: How to achieve load balancing of HTTPS requests through Nginx reverse proxy? Please provide a configuration file and instructions.
Assistant: To implement load balancing of HTTPS requests through the Nginx reverse proxy, you need to follow the steps below to configure: 1. Install Nginx and enable the SSL module Install the SSL module on the Nginx server and generate an SSL certificate and key. The configuration file needs to have the following content: ``` http { ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m; ssl_session_timeout 5m; ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; #Select the protocol version ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM -SHA256:HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!RC4:!DHE; #Select encryption algorithm ssl_certificate /path/to/your/server.crt; #Certificate path ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/server.key; #Certificate Private key path} ``` 2. Configure the reverse proxy to forward all HTTPS requests to multiple backend servers. An IP address or a domain name can be used as an identifier for a backend server. ``` upstream backend { server backend1.example.com:443; server backend2.example.com:443; } server { listen 443 ssl; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass https://backend; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` This configuration forwards all HTTPS requests to a list of upstream servers named "backend". The 'proxy_set_header' exercise sets the necessary request headers for the target server to call the client IP address and the actual host header. 3. Configure the load balancing strategy to use the Nginx default load balancing strategy, and other strategies such as least_conn, ip_hash, etc. can also be used. After the above "upstream backend" block, add the following line: ``` upstream backend { least_conn; #Use the least connection load balancing strategy server backend1.example.com:443; server backend2.example.com:443; } ` `` This configuration will use the least connections load balancing strategy. Now, when an encrypted request comes to Nginx, it will be proxied to one of the servers behind it and will automatically balance the traffic to all servers.
