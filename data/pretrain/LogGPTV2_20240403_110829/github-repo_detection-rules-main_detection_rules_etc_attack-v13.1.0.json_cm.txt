### Bypass User Account Control (UAC)

**Description:**
Adversaries may attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) mechanisms to elevate process privileges on a system. UAC in Windows allows programs to request elevated permissions, which are tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high. If the UAC protection level is not set to the highest, certain Windows programs can execute elevated [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box.

**Examples:**
- **Rundll32:** Using `rundll32.exe` to load a specially crafted DLL that loads an auto-elevated COM object and performs file operations in protected directories.
- **Malicious Injection:** Injecting malicious software into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without user prompts.

**Bypass Methods:**
- **eventvwr.exe:** Can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script.
- **Lateral Movement:** If credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, UAC can be bypassed since it is a single-system security mechanism.

**Detection:**
- Monitor process launches and actions that could indicate a UAC bypass.
- Detect unusual loaded DLLs and process injection attempts.
- Monitor specific Registry keys for unauthorized changes, such as:
  - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command`
  - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe`

### Timestomp

**Description:**
Adversaries may modify the timestamps of files to obfuscate their activities. This technique, known as timestomping, changes the modify, access, create, and change times of a file to mimic other files in the same folder. This is often used to hide malware and tools by making them appear less conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools.

**Detection:**
- Use forensic techniques to detect modified file timestamps.
- Monitor file handle opens and compare timestamp values.
- Detect timestomping using file modification monitoring and log collection.

### Internet Connection Discovery

**Description:**
Adversaries may check for internet connectivity on compromised systems to determine if the system can communicate with their command and control (C2) servers. This can be done using various methods, such as `Ping`, `tracert`, and GET requests to websites.

**Detection:**
- Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that check internet connectivity.
- Correlate these checks with other suspicious activities to identify potential C2 communication attempts.

### Sudo and Sudo Caching

**Description:**
Adversaries may use `sudo` and sudo caching to elevate privileges on Linux and macOS systems. `Sudo` allows users to run commands with elevated privileges, and sudo caching can temporarily store credentials, allowing repeated use without re-prompting for a password.

**Configuration:**
- **Timestamp Timeout:** The time before `sudo` re-prompts for a password.
- **tty_tickets:** Treats each terminal session in isolation, affecting the timeout.

**Abuse:**
- Adversaries can monitor the `/var/db/sudo` file to check if the timestamp falls within the timeout range.
- Disabling `tty_tickets` can make scripting easier by issuing `echo 'Defaults !tty_tickets' >> /etc/sudoers`.

**Detection:**
- Use `auditd` to log every time a user's actual ID and effective ID differ.
- Enable logging for all input and output based on the `LOG_INPUT` and `LOG_OUTPUT` directives in the `/etc/sudoers` file.

### Archive via Custom Method

**Description:**
Adversaries may compress or encrypt data using custom methods before exfiltration. Custom archival methods, such as XOR encryption or custom implementations of well-known compression algorithms, can be used to avoid detection.

**Detection:**
- Custom archival methods can be very difficult to detect, as they often use standard programming concepts like bitwise operations.
- Monitor for unusual file creation and script execution that may indicate custom archival methods.

### Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure

**Description:**
Adversaries may modify cloud compute infrastructure to evade defenses. This can include creating, deleting, or modifying components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.

**Detection:**
- Establish centralized logging for cloud compute infrastructure activities.
- Monitor for suspicious sequences of events, such as the creation of multiple snapshots in a short period.
- Use valid change management procedures to introduce known identifiers to distinguish expected actions from malicious ones.

### Malvertising

**Description:**
Adversaries may purchase online advertisements to distribute malware. These ads can be placed prominently in search results and may target specific audiences. Malvertisements can trick users into clicking on ads that redirect them to malicious domains.

**Detection:**
- Monitor for suspicious ad clicks and redirections.
- Use automated detection and policy enforcement to identify and block malicious ads.
- Employ techniques to detect and block dynamic routing and typosquatting.

### Security Account Manager (SAM)

**Description:**
Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database. This requires SYSTEM-level access and can be done through in-memory techniques or by extracting the SAM from the Windows Registry.

**Tools:**
- `pwdumpx.exe`
- `gsecdump`
- `Mimikatz`
- `secretsdump.py`

**Detection:**
- Monitor for hash dumping activities, such as opening the SAM file or creating a dump of the Registry SAM key.
- Detect and log any unauthorized access to the SAM or Registry.

**Description:**
Adversaries may search public WHOIS data for information about victims, such as assigned IP blocks, contact information, and DNS nameservers. This information can be used for further reconnaissance, establishing operational resources, and initial access.

**Detection:**

**Description:**
Adversaries may exploit weak Registry permissions for services to execute their own malicious payloads. This can be done by changing the service's `binPath/ImagePath` to point to a different executable under their control.

**Detection:**
- Monitor for changes to service binary paths and failure parameters.
- Use tools like `Autoruns for Windows` to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence.
