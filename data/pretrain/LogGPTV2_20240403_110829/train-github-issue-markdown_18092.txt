**Type of Issue:**
- [x] Bug Report

### Current Behavior
The Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compiler is generating `.ngfactory.ts` files for the `@angular/material` package when using `platformBrowser().bootstrapModuleFactory`. To ensure successful compilation, I need to include the `@angular/material` directory in the `rootDirs` configuration.

### Expected Behavior
I expected the AoT compiler to process only the components, styles, and templates within my own project, excluding third-party libraries like `@angular/material`.

### Minimal Reproduction
To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. Edit the `tsconfig.json` file and change the `rootDirs` setting from:
   ```json
   "rootDirs": ["./dev", "./node_modules/@angular/material"]
   ```
   to:
   ```json
   "rootDirs": ["./dev"]
   ```

2. Attempt to compile the project. The AoT compiler will fail with approximately 20-30 errors similar to:
   ```
   Error: File 'C:/.../node_modules/@angular/material/button-toggle/button-toggle.ngfactory.ts' is not under 'rootDir'.
   ```

3. If you include the `@angular/material` directory in `rootDirs` and allow the compilation to complete, the resulting directory structure in the output folder will be poorly organized. Additionally, the application will fail in the browser with `404 Not Found` errors when trying to load files such as:
   - `/@angular/core/bundles/core.umd.js/src/linker/ng_module_factory.js`
   - `/@angular/common/bundles/common.umd.js/src/common_module.js`

4. The `app.module.ngfactory.ts` file contains suspicious-looking imports, such as:
   ```typescript
   import * as import87 from '../../node_modules/@angular/material/dialog/dialog-container.ngfactory';
   import * as import90 from '../../node_modules/@angular/material/tooltip/tooltip.ngfactory';
   ```

### Motivation for Changing the Behavior
The goal is to get the AoT compilation to work correctly without including third-party library directories in `rootDirs`, which leads to a poorly structured output and runtime issues.

### Environment
- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **IDE:** PhpStorm
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.1
