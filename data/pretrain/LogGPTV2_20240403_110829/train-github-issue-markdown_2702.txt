Hi,
After some googling and asking on IRC, there doesn't seem to be a global
defaults variable file where you can set things like accelerate and
gather_facts.
group_vars/all doesn't seem to work for variables at this level.
This means that for a big playbook with many plays you have to explicitly set
them for each play, this is probably suboptimal ?
