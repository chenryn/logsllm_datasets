## Abstract

With the advent of programmable radios, it is becoming easier for wireless nodes to manipulate carrier-sense behavior to gain an unfair share of bandwidth. This paper studies a solution for detecting such selfish carrier-sensing behavior in 802.11 networks using passive monitoring. Our approach involves deploying sniffers across the network to capture wireless traffic traces, which are then analyzed using a machine learning technique to infer carrier-sense relationships between nodes. Evaluations using both real testbeds and ns2 simulations demonstrate that our method provides an accurate estimate of selfishness with high confidence. The approach is completely passive and unobtrusive, requiring only the deployment of sniffers.

## 1. Introduction

The emergence of programmable radios has made it possible to manipulate various MAC layer parameters, allowing nodes to gain an unfair share of available bandwidth. For example, a node can set a higher Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) threshold to reduce its backoff period, thereby increasing its transmission opportunities. This can cause other nodes to back off more frequently, leading to collisions and reduced throughput. Experiments have shown that a selfish node can gain at least 5 Mbps more throughput than its fair share [17].

While there are efforts to develop new protocols and rules for spectrum use, it is essential to detect and police such selfish behavior. In this paper, we focus on detecting asymmetric or disabled carrier-sensing behavior in 802.11 networks using passive monitoring. Our goal is to detect such behavior regardless of the network topology or architecture.

### 2.1 Detecting MAC-Layer Misbehavior in 802.11

Several approaches have been proposed to detect MAC-layer misbehavior in 802.11 networks. Cagalj et al. [5] developed a distributed protocol that leads selfish nodes to behave optimally. Konoroski [13] used a game-theoretic scheme to detect deviations from ideal backoff mechanisms. Radosavac [19] employed the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to identify misbehaving nodes. DOMINO [21] can detect nodes that manipulate backoff windows but cannot distinguish between different types of misbehavior, such as backoff manipulation or carrier-sense disabling.

### 2.2 Use of Distributed Sniffers

Distributed sniffers have been used in previous studies to measure various network properties, such as congestion, protocol behavior, and security. For example, the DAIR system [2] uses distributed sniffers for troubleshooting. However, these studies do not focus on detecting carrier-sense manipulation. In this paper, we use a similar approach to merge individual traces into a unified trace and analyze them to identify selfish carrier-sense behavior.

## 3. Broad Approach

Our approach involves deploying a set of 'sniffers' across the network to collect traffic traces. These traces are then merged and analyzed using a machine learning technique to detect asymmetry in carrier-sense behavior between node pairs. If one node consistently senses the carrier while the other does not, this indicates potential selfish behavior. Our method is completely passive and unobtrusive, relying solely on the analysis of captured traffic.

## 4. HMM-Based Formulation

We use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the carrier-sense behavior of nodes. The HMM captures the probabilistic nature of carrier-sense events and allows us to infer the likelihood of selfish behavior. The details of the HMM-based formulation and the machine learning technique are provided in Section IV.

## 5. Experimental and Simulation-Based Evaluations

We evaluate our approach using both real testbeds and ns2 simulations. The results show that our method can accurately detect selfish carrier-sense behavior with high confidence. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of our approach, including the impact of radio implementation and the fidelity of the sniffers.

## 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a method for detecting selfish carrier-sense behavior in 802.11 networks using passive monitoring. Our approach, based on deploying sniffers and analyzing traffic traces with a machine learning technique, provides an accurate and unobtrusive way to detect such behavior. Future work will focus on addressing the challenges and limitations identified in this study.
