I haven't yet narrowed down a simple test case, but we recently saw a problem
where we're trying to load multiple spring bean definition files from jars
packaged in an ear using a well-known filename approach (e.g.
classpath*:beans.xml)
What we're seeing is that the same UrlResource is being returned multiple
times. While its harmless in that it only results in beans redefining
themselves with the same definition, it does cause a lot of noise in the logs
and increases our start up time just slightly. We've also seen cases where the
same URL is returned albeit with slightly different path represenatations (
/beans.xml vs. /./beans.xml)
It would be nice if findAllClassPathResources() ensured each unique resource
is returned once and only once. One simple change is just changing from List
to Set to hold the resources while enumerating. This fixes the first part
(same path multiple times) and fixing the second part should just be a matter
of normalizing the URL.
