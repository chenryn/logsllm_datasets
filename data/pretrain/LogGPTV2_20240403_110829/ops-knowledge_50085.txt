Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the text:

"During pattern analysis of the log, a reverse mapping check for `ns.marryaldkfaczcz.com` (IP: 173.234.31.186) failed. This may indicate a potential break-in attempt."

If you prefer a more generalized format, you can use:

"During pattern analysis of the log, a reverse mapping check for `<hostname>` (IP: `<IP address>`) failed. This may indicate a potential break-in attempt."
