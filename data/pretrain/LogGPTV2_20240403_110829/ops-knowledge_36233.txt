User: I know bit of all sed, awk , python , but not perl.
I need to parse around 100s of different files , find patterns , match multiple columns with each other and put in new files.
and i have to do that on regular basis.
I just want to know which tool will be best for that scenario.
based on that i will buy that books and get more advanced knowledge on that subject
Assistant: This thread is going to start a war on which is best :)
As you know python, you should definitely go with that. I myself have done a lot of text manipulation using python, where everything else tend to become complex.
Even though awk can do what you need, you won't like what you see in the code.
