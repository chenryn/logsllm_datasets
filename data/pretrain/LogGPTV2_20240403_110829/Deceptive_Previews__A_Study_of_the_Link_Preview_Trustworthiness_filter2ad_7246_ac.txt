### Analysis of Access Logs for Social Media Platforms

#### A. Redirection Techniques
To analyze how social media platforms handle URL redirection, we implemented both server-side (using 303 and 307 status codes) and client-side (via HTML tags or JavaScript) redirections. The results, summarized in Table V, show that all platforms correctly handle server-side redirections. Facebook is the only platform that supports both types of client-side redirections (HTML and JavaScript). Overall, the link previews generated do not differ significantly from those created when posting direct links.

#### B. Network Signatures
We analyzed incoming HTTP requests to identify unique signatures that can help determine if a request originates from a social media platform. To ensure our logs did not contain user activities, we limited post visibility where possible. Medium and Plurk, which do not support access restrictions, were manually verified to contain only platform-generated requests.

**Methodology:**
1. **User-Agent Strings:** We parsed log entries to extract user-agent strings and compared them against known browser strings. Unique substrings, such as "facebookexternalhit" for Facebook or "vkShare; +http://vk.com/dev/Share" for VK, were used to classify entries as bot traffic.
2. **IP Addresses and ASNs:** We resolved IP addresses to autonomous system numbers (ASNs) and searched for unique substrings in AS names. For example, Facebook's requests originate from AS 32934, named "Facebook, Inc." When the AS name matched a platform or a known provider, we classified the entry as a service provider.

**Results:**
- All 20 social media platforms use at least one user-agent string linked to their company or service, allowing for immediate traffic filtering.
- Seven platforms (Xing, Medium, Instagram, Messenger, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Slack) use multiple user-agent headers.
- Seven platforms (Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Messenger, Skype, Line, and KakaoTalk) use user-agent strings indistinguishable from browsers, but the analysis of IPs and ASes provides a stronger signal.
- Three instant messaging apps (WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Viber) request resources directly from users' phones, increasing the difficulty in distinguishing organic traffic. However, they include the app name in the user-agent string, allowing classification as bot traffic.

#### C. Link Preview Coherence
We investigated how social media platforms keep link previews up to date when a page changes over time. We generated unique URLs, posted them, and used a bot to periodically visit the preview pages over 14 days.

**Results:**
- Eight out of ten social networks requested the page only once on the submission date and never again.
- Twitter and Pinterest requested the web page multiple times over 14 days.
- Seven social networks requested associated resources only once at submission time, while Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn requested link preview images more regularly.

#### D. Key Takeaways
1. **Reliance on Meta Tags:** Social media platforms rely heavily on meta tags, especially Open Graph markup, for rendering previews. Inconsistent use of fields and templates can mislead users into making incorrect security decisions.
2. **Distinguishable Signatures:** Platform requests contain unique signatures that website owners can use to identify social media traffic, enabling potential cloaking attacks.
3. **Temporal Behavior:** Platforms fetch resources for link previews infrequently over 14 days, which is sufficient for a successful malicious campaign.

### IV. Malicious Content and User Awareness

#### A. Prior Work and Defenses
Previous studies have shown that adversaries can share malicious content on social media, such as phishing pages. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook have deployed defenses, including URL blacklisting and antivirus measures.

#### B. Experimental Setup
We shared links to two types of malicious content (Virut/EICAR and blacklisted URLs) to evaluate countermeasures and user awareness.

**Sharing Types:**
- **Direct Links:** Shared directly.
- **Resource Redirection:** Redirected through resources.
- **Client-Side Redirection:** Using HTML or JavaScript.
- **Server-Side Redirection:** Using 303 and 307 status codes.

**Observations:**
- **Social Networks:** Most platforms did not display previews for malicious content, with some exceptions.
- **Instant Messengers:** Similar behavior, with some platforms displaying previews and others blocking them.

**Key Findings:**
- **Countermeasures:** Platforms employ various methods to block or warn about malicious content.
- **User Awareness:** Users may still be at risk due to inconsistent handling of malicious links across different platforms.

This analysis provides insights into the behavior of social media platforms and highlights the need for consistent and robust defenses against malicious content.
