**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
In version 2.x Quick Fix imports have suffixed the imports with the correct
file extension now in 3.x I always have to add `.ts` etc manually which is
painful.
**Describe the solution you'd like**  
Add the feature back which automatically handled the file extensions.
