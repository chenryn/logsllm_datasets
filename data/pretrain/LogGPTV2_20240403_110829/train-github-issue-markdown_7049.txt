 **Elasticsearch version** : 5.0.0-alpha1
**JVM version** : 1.8.0_51
**OS version** : CentOS 6.6
**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :  
I try to install elasticsearch plugin such as elasticsearch-head and
elasticsearch-kopf. The example below occurs on both elasticsearch-head and
elasticsearch-kopf.
I run `./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install mobz/elasticsearch-head`, and I got
MalformedURLException: no protocol. It seems that elasticsearch-5.0.0-alpha1
asking for full URL.
If I supply another full URL to install:  
`./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-
head`  
I got this error message:  
`ERROR: `elasticsearch` directory is missing in the plugin zip`
Looks like there are some changes in the elasticsearch plugin module. Is this
a bug or expected behavior? Does the package require specific folder or
specific stuffs to be compatible to elasticsearch-5.0.0-alpha1?
Thanks!
