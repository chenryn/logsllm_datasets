User: How to use Ansible for batch deployment of servers?
Assistant: To use Ansible to deploy servers in batches, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Write Ansible's main configuration file ansible.cfg to specify specific configuration options used by Ansible. 2. Install Ansible on the Ansible host and configure the host list file hosts to specify the list of target servers to be deployed. 3. Create an Ansible playbook file and define tasks and actions, such as provisioning servers, installing software, copying files, etc. 4. Run the playbook file to apply the task to all target servers, use the command "ansible-playbook playbook.yml" to run the playbook file. 5. Manage and monitor servers as needed, use related Ansible modules such as OS or process, and combine other tools and plug-ins, such as Docker or Kubernetes for containerized deployment to improve efficiency and flexibility. Through the above steps, batch deployment and management of servers can be easily realized, eliminating the need for repeated manual operations and management processes, and improving efficiency and reliability.
