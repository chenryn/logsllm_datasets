**Abstract:**
This paper summarizes the panel discussion held at the 9th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems in Funchal, Madeira, from June 12-16, 2007. The panel addressed the question: "Are you still working on Inter-Enterprise System and Application Integration?" The discussion featured distinguished experts in process management, workflow, Web services, SOA, and the Semantic Web.

**Keywords:**
Inter-enterprise integration, business process management, workflow, Web service, SOA, semantic Web.

**We Are Creating Our Own Problems, e.g., Current Standardization Efforts Are Only Increasing Complexity!**

The complexity of building enterprise systems and the interoperability between them is a significant challenge. Setting up a modern middleware platform is inherently complex, especially when integrating software from different vendors. While the fundamental idea of web services is sound, the abundance of overlapping standards for web services composition has created a new "Tower of Babel." Standards are often proposed without clear semantics, and new standards frequently build upon existing ones before they are fully adopted. This situation, referred to as "Web Services Acronym Hell" (WSAH), highlights the need to focus on a few well-defined standards. The "Not Invented Here" syndrome, where organizations resist adopting established best practices and theories, exacerbates this problem. For instance, new process modeling languages are frequently proposed by individuals who may be unaware of foundational concepts such as bisimulation, true concurrency, Turing completeness, and Petri nets.

**Find Out What Is Really Going on Before (re)Designing a System!**

Reality often differs significantly from what is modeled or perceived. Regardless of the modeling language used (e.g., Petri nets, BPMN, UML), models are abstractions and may not accurately reflect reality. While some abstraction is inevitable, it is crucial to ensure that models are as close to reality as possible. Managers and system designers often rely on "PowerPoint" representations, leading to serious alignment issues. It is essential to invest more effort in understanding actual processes. Process mining, which leverages event logs, can be a valuable tool in this context. Detailed event logs, available in various systems, enable the analysis of run-time behavior.

**Do Not Specify More Than Strictly Needed!**

Organizations and individuals generally behave reasonably, but many systems and standards tend to over-specify processes. For example, BPEL, while powerful, is procedural and similar to classical workflow languages. It is unclear why organizations should agree on using BPEL, especially when subcontracting work to other entities. A more declarative language would be more appropriate. Trust in people and organizations implies that under-specification, rather than over-specification, of processes is preferable.

**Let’s Make Fuzziness Explicit!**

There is a gap between high-level modeling languages and executable languages. For instance, about 20% of the 600+ process models in the SAP reference model contain errors like deadlocks and livelocks. This disconnect between models and actual software highlights the challenges of transitioning from abstract diagrams to executable models. Current languages are either informal or have limited executable interpretations, making it difficult to support the modeling process adequately. A single language that can handle both precise and vague elements would be beneficial to avoid costly misinterpretations.

**If You Are Still Working on Inter-Enterprise System and Application Integration, Then You Should Re-evaluate and Re-assess Your Research Agenda, Because … The World Moved On**

The concept of an "application" is evolving. Applications no longer need to be locally installed and licensed; instead, they can be provided as services (SaaS). Additionally, the term "mash-up" is gaining momentum, representing the integration of existing web interfaces to create new functionalities. This development is part of the broader "Web 2.0" trend, which departs from traditional single-system user interfaces to integrate functions from multiple remote systems.

From an academic perspective, the topic of integration has failed to establish a clear, agreed-upon conceptual and working model. Unlike the success of relational database management systems in the database research community, the integration research community has not developed a solid foundation.

**SaaS (Software as a Service)**

SaaS is distinct from application hosting or web services. It allows multiple tenants to use the same software installation, with each tenant having unique data. Examples include eBay, where customers share the same functionality but have different data. SaaS also extends to middleware services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon SQS. Multi-tenant awareness is now extending to the design-time domain, allowing tenant-specific configurations within the same installation, as seen with Salesforce.com.

**Web 2.0**

Web 2.0 addresses the integration of existing web functionalities into new, combined forms. For example, Trulia and Zillow integrate real estate listings, maps, and financial information. Social networks like LinkedIn provide new types of functionality by leveraging explicit knowledge of social relationships.

**The World Really Moved On**

In summary, the nature of entities requiring integration has fundamentally changed, moving away from the idea that an entity represents a single organization or location. While it will take time for all systems to adopt the SaaS and Web 2.0 models, their widespread adoption across various domains suggests they will become mainstream.

**Meaning of ‘Integration’**

If you are still focused on integration, you need to re-evaluate what "inter-enterprise" and "application" integration mean in this new context. Consider whether it is worth developing a common conceptual model, similar to the success of relational database management systems.

**New World Order for Interactions Across Enterprise Information Systems in the Flat World**

As the world becomes more interconnected, the dominance of agriculture and manufacturing has given way to the dominance of services. Businesses are increasingly interdependent, outsourcing critical operations and relying on global partners. This interdependence has led to new business models, shifting from selling products to providing services.

Despite these changes, legacy enterprise applications have evolved slowly, while new applications have advanced rapidly. Interactions among applications have changed significantly, particularly in terms of process realization. We revisited old data mapping challenges in the context of Web Services and found that while using SAWSDL, we could reuse earlier work with little advancement. Understanding the four levels of interoperability—system, syntax, structure, and semantics—can help reduce unnecessary rework. These levels also apply to processes and process interoperability.

In [6], we outlined three types of inter-organizational workflows: process portal, process vortex, and dynamic trading processes. With the increasing importance of dynamic trading processes, we recognize the need to adapt to relevant events and optimize processes. Human and organizational roles in managing processes are becoming more sophisticated. IBM's notion of Services Science emphasizes the need to model both technical and human aspects of systems supporting services.

In the context of Services Science, we have outlined a Semantic Services Science framework to address these challenges.
