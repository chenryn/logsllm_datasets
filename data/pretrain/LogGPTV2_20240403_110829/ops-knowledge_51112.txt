User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can't connect to SSH/SFTP - but only in certain programs I'm using UltraEdit (Windows) to edit files on remote SFTP servers. For some reason I can no longer connect to one of those servers.

Here's what was changed:


The server was moved (and updated) from one VM to another - usually this only prompts about rsa fingerprint changed and then works with no other changes needed.
I've been trying out different software for mapping SSH/SFTP as a Windows drives.


The connection seemed to break after mapping the server in ExpanDrive (I'm almost certain that I continued working on the server after it was moved and updated).

Some points worth noting:


The problem only exists for this particular server as I can still connect to the other VMs (which are in the same network and have the same requirements to log in).
I can still connect to the server with PuTTY (after updating rsa fingerprint)
FileZilla SFTP also works as well
Some driver mappers work (SFTP Net Drive, sshfs), some don't (ExpanDrive, WebDrive)
I've removed all entries containing the server name in the registry.

Any idea what could be causing the connection issue in UltraEdit/drive mappers?

Assistant: Found out that my home computer has the same issue and I definitely did not mess around with SSH drive mappers there, so the issue had to be related to the server upgrade.

I am running UltraEdit v20.00 - tried running a trial of v22.10 which solved the issue.

I assume there are some SSH changes in the newer Debian version which are not supported by UltraEdit v20.00, but fixed in a later version (probably v21.30, see http://www.ultraedit.com/products/ultraedit/latest-changes.html "...improvements and fixes to the following: FTP/SFTP").

Most likely the same issue that prevents me from mapping drives in certain applications.
