User: I have a lovely Macbook now, and I'm enjoying coding on the move. I'm also enjoying coding in Python. However, I'd like to distribute the end result to friends using Windows, as an executable.
I know that Py2Exe does this, but I don't know how portable Python is across operating systems. Can anyone offer any advice? I'm using PyGame too.
Many thanks
Assistant: The Python scripts are reasonably portable, as long as the interpreter and relevant libraries are installed. Generated .exe and .app files are not.
