User: I'm working with OpenCV using Python on Linux.
I always installed OpenCV building the the Source with make. As you know there are many guides online which all say pretty much the same things.
Now i found some guys which say to install OpenCV using apt-get with the command

sudo apt-get install python-opencv

Which are the difference between the two methods ? Can i just use the apt-get command ? 
I looked around for an answer, but i still don't understand if i can avoid building OpenCV.
Assistant: Of course, it's much easier to use the apt-get variant.
Some drawbacks are, that you might not get the most recent version hence the apt-get package isn't updated as fast as the sources are. Furthermore you'll have a higher level of control according to modules that are going to be installed and the compile parameters, when using the "make way".
If you just want an easy way, use the apt-get install version. If you want control, flexibility and the most recent version, use the make version and compile the source code according to your needs.
