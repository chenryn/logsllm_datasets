In the latest version of Flutter the behaviour of button presses is wrong.
Sometimes taps are missed because there is a move threshold - pressing, moving
then releasing your finger on a button does not result in a click.
That must be deliberate, and I guess someone thought it was the correct
behaviour but it's not. The threshold is only a couple of mm too, so it's
quite common for taps to be missed.
Native Android apps have a better behaviour - they only cancel the click if
your finger is moved off the hit area for the button. If you keep your finger
on the button it will send a click even no matter how far you move it. This is
much nicer to use.
I've made a video showing the difference (not sure why the mouse cursor is
offset - ignore that).
