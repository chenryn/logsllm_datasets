Another issue is the time sensitivity of IP threats. An event
that originated from an IP address, like scanning activity or
a brute-force attack, will not last forever. If one scan feed
reports an IP address today and another feed reports the same
IP three months later, it would make little sense to consider
them as one scanning event and label the second occurrence as
being three months late. Unfortunately, there is no easy way
we can clearly distinguish events from each other. Here we
use a one-month window to restrict an event, assuming that
the same attack from one source will not last for more than 30
days; although arbitrary, it provides a reasonably conservative
threshold, and experimenting with other thresholds produced
similar overall results. More speciﬁcally, we calculate relative
latency by tracking the ﬁrst occurrence of IPs in all feeds
in a category, then recording the latency of the following
occurrences while excluding ones that occur after 30 days. By
just using the ﬁrst appearance of each IP as the base, we avoid
the uncertainty caused by multiple occurrence of indicators
and different valid periods used among feeds.
Figures 2a and 2b show the relative latency distribution
among feeds in the scan and brute-force categories, in hours.
We focus on just those feeds that have over 10% of their data
shared with others to ensure the analysis can represent the
latency distribution of the overall feed. There is one feed
in each category (PA Snort BlockList in scan and PA Brute-
Force in brute-force) that is excluded from the ﬁgure.
! Finding: From the distribution boxes we can see that Paid
IP Reputation in scan and Badips SSH in brute-force are
the fastest feeds in their category, as they have the lowest
median and 75th percentile latencies. On the other hand, PA
Analyst in scan and Badips Badbots in brute-force are the
slowest feeds. Figure 2a shows that all scan feeds except one
have their 25th percentile latency equal to 0, indicating these
feeds, across different sizes, all reported a signiﬁcant portion
of their shared data ﬁrst. A similar case also happens in the
brute-force category.
One may reasonably ask whether large feeds report data
sooner than small feeds. The result shows that this is not
always the case. FB Aggregator1 is the second smallest feed
in our scan category, yet it is no slower than several other feeds
which have over 10 times of its daily rate. Badips Badbots,
on the other hand, has the second largest rate in brute-force
category, but it is slower than all the other feeds in the brute-
force category. Feeds that are small in volume can still report
a lot of their data ﬁrst.
Another factor that could affect latency is whether feeds
copy data from each other. For example, 93% of Dangerrulez
Brute also appears in Badips SSH. If this is the case, we
expect Dangerrulez Brute will be faster than Badips SSH
on reporting their shared data. However, we compared the
relative latency between just two feeds and found Badips
SSH reported 88% of their shared indicators ﬁrst. We further
conducted this pairwise latency comparison between all feeds

Each box shows the latency distribution of shared IPs in the feed calculated in

median. (“Badips Username*” here is the abbreviation for feed name Badips

proportion of their indicators is still unique to the feed. When
we aggregate the data in each category, 73% of all scan feed
indicators are unique to a single feed and 88% of brute force
feed indicators are unique to one feed. For other categories,
over 97% of elements in the category are unique to a single
feed. This result agrees with previous work that most data in
threat intelligence feeds is unique [26, 42].
3.5 Latency
Feed latency measures how quickly a feed reports new threat
indicators. The sooner a feed can report potential threats, the
more valuable it is for consumers. The absolute latency of
an indicator in a feed is the time from the beginning of the
corresponding event until when the indicator shows up in the
feed. However, it is difﬁcult to know the actual time when
an event begins from the threat intelligence data. Instead, we
measure the relative latency, which is the delay of an indicator
in one feed to be the time between its appearance in that feed
and the ﬁrst seen among all the feeds.
Relative latency can only be calculated for indicators that
occur in at least two feeds. As discussed in Section 3.4, the
number of common indicators in the botnet, malware, exploit
and spam feeds is very low (fewer than 3% of elements occur
in more than one feed). Relative latency calculated for these
feeds is less meaningful. For this analysis, therefore, we focus

in scan, brute-force and malware (since Paid IP Reputation
shares non-trivial amount of data with a few small feeds in the
malware category), and did not see a clear latency advantage
between any two feeds. Note that this observation does not
prove there is no data copying, since the shared data between
two feeds might partially come from copying and partially
from the feeds’ own data collection. Furthermore, our latency
analysis is at a one-hour granularity.
3.6 Accuracy
Accuracy measures the rate of false positives in a feed. A false
positive is an indicator that data is labeled with a category to
which it does not belong. For example, an IP address found
in a scan feed that has not conducted any Internet scanning is
one such false positive. As well, even if a given IP is in fact
associated with malicious activity, if it is not unambiguously
actionable (e.g., Google’s DNS at 8.8.8.8 is used by malicious
and benign software alike) then for many use cases it must also
be treated as a false positive. False positives are problematic
for a variety of reasons, but particularly because they can have
adverse operational consequences. For example, one might
reasonably desire to block all new network connections to
and from IP addresses reported as hosting malicious activity
(indeed, this use is one of the promises of threat intelligence).
False positives in such feeds, though, could lead to blocking
legitimate connections as well. Thus, the degree of accuracy
for a feed may preclude certain use cases.
Unfortunately, determining which IPs belong in a feed and
which do not can be extremely challenging. In fact, at any
reasonable scale, we are unaware of any method for unam-
biguously and comprehensively establishing “ground truth”
on this matter. Instead, in this section we report on a proxy
for accuracy that provides a conservative assessment of this
question. To wit, we assemble a whitelist of IP addresses that
either should not reasonably be included in a feed, or that, if
included, would cause signiﬁcant disruption. We argue that
the presence of such IPs in a feed are clearly false positives
and thus deﬁne an upper bound on a feed’s accuracy. We
populate our list from three sources: unroutable IPs, IPs as-
sociated with top Alexa domains, and IPs of major content
distribution networks (CDNs).
Unroutable IPs. Unroutable IPs are IP addresses that were
not BGP-routable when they ﬁrst appeared in a feed, as es-
tablished by contemporaneous data in the RouteViews ser-
vice [44]. While such IPs could have appeared in the source
address ﬁeld of a packet (i.e., due to address spooﬁng), it
would not be possible to complete a TCP handshake. Feeds
that imply that such an interaction took place should not in-
clude such IPs. For example, feeds in the Brute-force category
imply that the IPs they contain were involved in brute-force
login attempts, but this could not have taken place if the IPs
are not routable. While including unroutable addresses in a
feed is not, in itself, a problem, their inclusion suggests a qual-
ity control issue with the feed, casting shade on the validity
of other indicators in the feed.
To allow for some delays in the feed, we check if an IP
was routable at any time in the seven days prior to its ﬁrst
appearance in a feed, and if it had, we do not count it as
unroutable. Table 2, column Unrt, shows the fraction of IP
indicators that were not routable at any time in the seven
days prior to appearing in the feed. This analysis is only
conducted for the IPs that are added after our measurement
started. The number of such IPs is shown in column Added,
