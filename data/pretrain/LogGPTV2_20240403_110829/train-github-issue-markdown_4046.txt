**Summary**
Apologies if this is not the right place to log this, but I seem to have the
exact same issue as described here:
#5894
but with VS2015 and the latest release of Typescript tools (1.8.6)
I've attached a sample project illustrating the issue. Essentially it's an
empty web application with a single app.ts typescript file in a src folder,
and a tsconfig.json file redirecting the output to a folder wwwroot.
**TypeScript Version:**  
1.7.5 (according to tsc -v from commandline - not really sure if Visual studio
uses the same?)  
Typescript tools for Visual Studio: 1.8.6.0
**Code**
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "noImplicitAny": false,
        "noEmitOnError": true,
        "removeComments": false,
        "sourceMap": true,
        "target": "es5",
        "outDir": "./wwwroot/"
      },
      "exclude": [
        "node_modules",
        "wwwroot"
      ]
    }

**Expected behavior:**
I can publish the project using File System publish method
**Actual behavior:**
The publish fails with the error message:
Copying file src\app.js to obj\Release\Package\PackageTmp\src\app.js failed.
Could not find file 'src\app.js'.
