### Private Key Pair File

It is possible to create a key pair in Visual Studio. In Visual Studio 2005, the C#, Visual Basic, and Visual J# integrated development environments (IDEs) allow you to generate key pairs and sign assemblies without using Sn.exe (Strong Name Tool). These IDEs provide a Signing tab in the Project Designer, making it easier to manage key pairs. The use of the `AssemblyKeyFileAttribute` to identify key file pairs has been deprecated in Visual Studio 2005.

### Using Strong Name Tool

The Sign Tool is a command-line utility that digitally signs files, verifies signatures, or timestamps files. It is not supported on Microsoft Windows NT, Windows Me, Windows 98, or Windows 95.

If you are not using the "Visual Studio Command Prompt" (accessed via Start > Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 > Visual Studio Tools > Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)), you can find `sn.exe` at `%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin\sn.exe`.

Here are some common `sn.exe` commands:

- **Create a new, random key pair and store it in `keyPair.snk`:**
  ```sh
  sn -k keyPair.snk
  ```

- **Store the key in `keyPair.snk` in the container `MyContainer` in the strong name CSP:**
  ```sh
  sn -i keyPair.snk MyContainer
  ```

- **Extract the public key from `keyPair.snk` and store it in `publicKey.snk`:**
  ```sh
  sn -p keyPair.snk publicKey.snk
  ```

- **Display the public key and the token for the public key contained in `publicKey.snk`:**
  ```sh
  sn -tp publicKey.snk
  ```

- **Verify the assembly `MyAsm.dll`:**
  ```sh
  sn -v MyAsm.dll
  ```

- **Delete `MyContainer` from the default CSP:**
  ```sh
  sn -d MyContainer
  ```

### Using the Assembly Linker (Al.exe)

The Assembly Linker (`al.exe`) is automatically installed with Visual Studio and the Windows SDK. To run the tool, it is recommended to use the Visual Studio Command Prompt or the Windows SDK Command Prompt (CMD Shell). These utilities simplify running the tool without navigating to the installation folder.

#### Accessing the Command Prompt

- **If you have Visual Studio installed:**
  - Click Start, then All Programs, then Visual Studio, then Visual Studio Tools, and finally Visual Studio Command Prompt.

- **If you have the Windows SDK installed:**
  - Click Start, then All Programs, then the folder for the Windows SDK, and then Command Prompt (or CMD Shell).

#### Command Syntax

```sh
al sources options
```

**Remarks:**

- All Visual Studio compilers produce assemblies. If you have one or more modules (metadata without a manifest), you can use `al.exe` to create an assembly with the manifest in a separate file.
- To manage assemblies in the cache, use the Global Assembly Cache Tool (`Gacutil.exe`).

**Example:**

- **Create an executable file `t2a.exe` with an assembly from the `t2.netmodule` module:**
  ```sh
  al t2.netmodule /target:exe /out:t2a.exe /main:MyClass.Main
  ```

### Using Assembly Attributes

You can directly insert strong name information into your code. Depending on where the key file is located, you can use either `AssemblyKeyFileAttribute` or `AssemblyKeyNameAttribute`.

**Compiler Options:**

- Use `/keyfile` or `/delaysign` to specify the key file or enable delayed signing.

**Safeguarding the Key Pair:**

- Protect the key pair from developers to maintain and guarantee the integrity of the assemblies. The public key should be accessible, but access to the private key should be restricted to a few individuals.
- When developing assemblies with strong names, each assembly that references the strong-named target assembly contains the token of the public key used to give the target assembly a strong name. This requires the public key to be available during the development process.
- You can use delayed or partial signing at build time to reserve space in the portable executable (PE) file for the strong name signature, but defer the actual signing until a later stage (typically just before shipping the assembly).

### Round Tripping

Round Tripping is a reverse engineering technique that allows an attacker to decompile an assembly from a certain application. `Ildasm.exe` can be used for this purpose, and `ILAsm` is used to recompile the assembly.

**MSIL Disassembler (Ildasm.exe):**

- This tool is a companion to the MSIL Assembler (`Ilasm.exe`). `Ildasm.exe` takes a PE file containing MSIL code and creates a text file suitable as input to `Ilasm.exe`.
- This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio and the Windows SDK.

**Importance of Obfuscation:**

- Round Tripping is a technique used to reverse engineer assemblies. To avoid this, it is advisable to apply obfuscation. There are various products available for this purpose, such as DeepSea, Crypto, or Dotfuscator.

**Using Obfuscation:**

- The most effective technique to prevent reverse engineering and tampering of assemblies is obfuscation. Visual Studio includes a version of Dotfuscator, which can be accessed via the Tools menu.

**Steps to Obfuscate Assemblies:**

1. Build the project in Visual Studio.
2. Go to Tools > Dotfuscator Community Edition.
3. A screen will prompt you to choose the project type; select "Create New Project" and click OK.
4. On the Input tab of the Dotfuscator interface, click "Browse and Add assembly to list."
5. Browse for the compiled application and add it to the list.

### ASP.NET Configurations

Securing resources in ASP.NET applications involves configuration settings in the `Web.config` file and IIS configurations. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive security framework.

**Secure Configuration Values:**

- Sensitive information saved in config files should be encrypted. For example, encryption keys stored in the `machineKey` element or connection strings with usernames and passwords for database logins.

**Lock ASP.NET Configuration Settings:**

- You can lock configuration settings in `Web.config` files by adding an `allowOverride` attribute to a `location` element.

**Configure Directories Using Location Settings:**

- Use the `<location>` element to establish settings for specific folders and files. The `path` attribute specifies the file or subdirectory.

**Configure Exceptions for Error Code Handling:**

- Properly handling and logging errors is crucial for analyzing potential attacks. Errors can be configured in the code or in the `Web.config` file.

**Input Validation:**

- Any data from external sources, including user inputs, data from web services, and database queries, should be validated. Defining a trust boundary can help visualize untrusted inputs. ASP.NET offers various types of validations, such as `RequiredFieldValidator`, `CompareValidator`, `RangeValidator`, `RegularExpressionValidator`, and `CustomValidator`.

### .NET Authentication Controls

In .NET, the `<authentication>` element in the configuration file configures the authentication mode. The appropriate mode depends on the application's design. The default setting in `Machine.config` is Windows authentication.

**Authentication Attributes:**

- `mode="[Windows|Forms|Passport|None]"`

**Types of Validation:**

- **Required entry:** `RequiredFieldValidator`
- **Comparison to a value:** `CompareValidator`
- **Range checking:** `RangeValidator`
- **Pattern matching:** `RegularExpressionValidator`
- **User-defined:** `CustomValidator`

**Forms Authentication Guidelines:**

- Set `mode="Forms"` on the `<authentication>` element.
- Configure Forms authentication using the child `<forms>` element.
- Recommendations:
  - Partition your website.
  - Set `protection="All"`.
  - Use small cookie timeout values.
  - Consider using a fixed expiration period.
  - Use SSL with Forms authentication.
  - If not using SSL, set `slidingExpiration="false"`.
  - Do not use the `<forms>` element on production servers.
  - Configure the `<machineKey>` element.
  - Use unique cookie names and paths.

**Classic ASP:**

- For classic ASP pages, authentication is usually performed manually by including user information in session variables after validation against a database.

**Code Review for .NET Managed Code:**

- .NET managed code is less vulnerable to common vulnerabilities found in unmanaged code, such as buffer overflows and memory corruption. However, there can still be issues affecting performance and security.
- **Code Access Security:**
  - Supports the execution of semi-trusted code, preventing several forms of security threats.
  - Use declarative security instead of imperative whenever possible.
  - Example of declarative syntax:
    ```csharp
    [MyPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, Unrestricted = true)]
    public class MyClass
    {
        public MyClass()
        {
            // The constructor is protected by the security call.
        }
        public void MyMethod()
        {
            // This method is protected by the security call.
        }
        public void YourMethod()
        {
            // This method is protected by the security call.
        }
    }
    ```
- **Exception Handling:**
  - Use exception handling for security purposes.
  - Avoid exception handling in loops.
  - Identify code that swallows exceptions.
  - Use exceptions for unexpected conditions, not for controlling the flow of the application.

**Tools:**

- **FxCop:**
  - An analysis tool that examines binary assemblies and has a predefined set of rules.
  - Some available security-related rules include:
    - `EnableEventValidationShouldBeTrue`
    - `ValidateRequestShouldBeEnabled`
    - `ViewStateEncryptionModeShouldBeAlways`
    - `EnableViewStateMacShouldBeTrue`
    - `EnableViewStateShouldBeTrue`
    - `ViewStateUserKeyShouldBeUsed`
    - `EnableCrossAppRedirectsShouldBeTrue`
    - `FormAuthenticationProtectionShouldBeAll`
    - `FormAuthenticationRequireSSLShouldBeTrue`
    - `FormAuthenticationShouldNotContainFormAuthenticationCredentials`
    - `CustomErrorPageShouldBeSpecified`
    - `DebugCompilationMustBeDisabled`

These tools and practices help ensure the security and integrity of your .NET applications.
