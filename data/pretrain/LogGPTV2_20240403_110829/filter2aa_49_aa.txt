## Introduction

"Get this and get it straight… Crime is a sucker’s road, and those who travel it wind up in the gutter, the prison, or the grave."
- Opening of the Philip Marlowe radio show

### Why Are We Doing This?

- **Phreaks as the Original Electronics "Hackers":** Phreaks were among the first to explore and exploit telephone systems.
- **It's a Way of Thinking:** Understanding the mindset of phreaks can provide insights into modern security challenges.
- **VoIP Wasn't Designed for Security:** The original design of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) did not prioritize security, leading to numerous vulnerabilities.
- **Mysteries of the Past Can Help You Understand the Present:** By examining historical exploits, we can better understand and mitigate current and future risks.

## User Dialing and Early Innovations

- **Strowger Switch:** Utilized alternating current pulses and a mechanical cylinder switch per digit, enabling the first user dialing by converting exchange names to numbers in small areas.
- **Carrier Growth Drives Innovation:**
  - **Burgeoning Operator Workforce Growth:** As the number of operators increased, so did the need for more efficient systems.
  - **Panel & Crossbar "Common Control":** These systems allowed the processing of numbers in the sender, followed by further processing.

## Information Leakage

- **Definition:** When a system designed for authorized use reveals sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
- **Rise of the Phreaks:**
  - **Social Engineering Operators and Phone Techs:** Phreaks used social engineering to gather information.
  - **In-band Clicks and Tones:** Exploiting in-band signals to gain access.
  - **Open Technical Journals and Exhaustive Dialing:** Using public information and brute force methods.
  - **Shared Knowledge:** Information was shared through looparounds and conference calls, and in underground papers.

### The World Finds Out

- **Secrets of the Little Blue Box, 1971 Esquire Article:** Introduced the world to "Phreaking" and notable figures like Joe Engressia, Mark Bernay, and John Draper.
- **ToS Violations:** Activities such as setting up joke lines were violations of Terms of Service.
- **Recommended Reading:** "Exploding the Phone" by Phil Lapsley.

## Evolution of VoIP

- **Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS):** Enabled more efficient signaling.
- **Personal Computers and Modems:** As personal computers became more common, modems allowed for IP-enabled transport of all data, including voice.
- **Analog Systems with IP Cards:** Analog systems were retrofitted with IP cards, and all-IP PBX systems were developed.
- **Virtualization:** Made PBX systems more accessible to a wider audience.

### Current Information Leakage

- **Ease of Access:** Curious individuals can experiment with VoIP systems using virtual machines or inexpensive trunk services.
- **Port Scanning, SIP Stack & OS Fingerprinting, and Extension Enumeration:** Common techniques for gathering information.
- **SIP & SDP Example:**
  ```plaintext
  INVITE sip:PI:EMAIL SIP/2.0
  Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 10.1.3.3:5060;branch=z9hG4bKb27061747269636b

### The Crypto That Time Forgot

  ```plaintext
  REGISTER sip:192.168.1.123 SIP/2.0
  Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.1.1:8166;branch=z9hG4bK-d8754z-0be76a4b680f6408-1---d8754z-;rport

### Information Gathering Tips

- **Google Searches, DNS Queries, Job Boards, and Voicemail:** These can reveal the type of phone system.
- **SIP OPTIONS or INVITE Requests:** Reveal key information such as User-Agent, Server, X-headers, and other header presence.
- **User or Extension Enumeration:**
- **Vulnerability Database Scan:** Helps identify potential vulnerabilities.

### SIP VoIP Info Gathering Tips

- **Port Scans:** Specify TCP and UDP, and scan for Asterisk AMI (port 5038).
- **Scan Slowly:** Use rate-based filters to avoid detection.
- **Use Multiple Tools and Modify Defaults:** For example, change the default User-Agent in SIPVicious.
- **Metasploit SIP Scanner:** Randomizes identifying fields.
- **Maintained Projects:** Viproy and Bluebox-ng are actively maintained.

### Asterisk User-Agents

- **Dataset Analysis:**
  - 15 million SIP entries.
  - 52,420 containing "Asterisk".
  - 10,776 are just "Asterisk PBX" (top server UA).
  - 1,156 are "Asterisk PBX 1.6.0.26-FONCORE-r78" (TrixBox).

**Special thanks to Daniel Abreu for help with ZMap data import to ElasticSearch w/Kibana.**

### Expected and Unexpected Findings

- **Expected:**
  - Insecure phones and MTAs.
  - Old SMB systems from Cisco, Nortel, Avaya, etc.
- **Unexpected:**
  - NORTEL-DMS100-SS7-ISUPbr.
  - 5,785 hits on "camera", 5,467 in China.
  - Top user-agent: 3.6 million "FRITZ!OS" MTAs deployed in Germany.
  - Many Huawei devices in Iran.

### Information Leakage Defense

- **Change Default SIP "User-Agent" String:**
  - In Asterisk, modify `sip_general_additional.conf` with `useragent=`.
  - In FreePBX Web GUI > Settings > Asterisk SIP Settings > Other SIP settings.
- **Block Bad User Agents and Use Rate Limiting.**
- **Add `alwaysauthreject=yes` to `sip_custom.conf` and ensure `username <> extension`.**
- **Implement Fail2ban to Block IPs:**
  - Trying to register to invalid extensions.
  - Having multiple registration failures.
  - Exceeding a reasonable message rate.
- **Use a Security Appliance to Block SIP Scans.**

## Exploitation

- **Definition:** The act of employing something to the greatest possible advantage, often for selfish purposes.
- **Historical Context:** Phreaks exploited weaknesses in the phone network to enable further exploration.
- **Modern Applications:** Exploitation now encompasses a wide range of activities, from fraud to unauthorized access.

### TrixBox

- **Immensely Popular Asterisk Front End:**
  - SourceForge Stats: 5.0 Stars (35 reviews).
  - Last Update: June 18, 2013.
