User: How to securely connect to a remote host via SSH for administration or file transfer?
Assistant: To securely connect to a remote host via SSH for management or file transfer, follow these steps: 1. Open a terminal or command line interface, and enter the ssh command followed by the IP address or domain name of the remote host, for example: ``` ssh user@192.168 .1.100 ``` Here, `user` is the username of the remote host, and `192.168.1.100` is the IP address of the remote host. 2. Enter a password for authentication. If the remote host has never been connected before, you will be prompted to confirm and save the SSH key of the remote host first. 3. Once connected, you can use terminal commands to manage or transfer files. For example, to upload a file via SSH, the following command can be used: ``` scp local_file.txt user@192.168.1.100:/remote/directory ``` This will upload the local file (local_file.txt) to /remote on the remote host /directory directory. 4. When you are done with your work, you can disconnect the SSH connection with the following command: ``` exit ``` This disconnects the connection to the remote host.
