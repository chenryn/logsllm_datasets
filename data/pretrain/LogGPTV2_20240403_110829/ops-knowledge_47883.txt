User: What is container technology? What technologies are included? How to use Docker to build a container?
Assistant: Container technology is a virtualization technology that can package an application and its related dependencies into a portable container to run and deploy in different environments. Common container technologies include: 1. Docker: build container images through Dockerfile, and operate containers through Docker commands 2. Kubernetes: a container cluster management system for automated container deployment, expansion, and operation 3. Mesos: manage distributed systems and Cluster management platform for application resources 4. rkt: a container virtualization engine designed based on Unix. The steps to build a container using Docker are as follows: 1. Install Docker 2. Create a Dockerfile to describe the mirror construction rules 3. Build a mirror through the Dockerfile 4 . Run Docker container Among them, Dockerfile can contain the following commands: FROM: base image MAINTAINER: maintainer information RUN: execute command ADD: add file COPY: copy file WORKDIR: working directory CMD: default container start command EXPOSE: expose port using command line The steps to build a Docker image are as follows: 1. Create a Dockerfile and define the image construction rules 2. Enter the directory where the Dockerfile is located, and execute the following command to build: docker build -t image_name . Among them, -t indicates the specified image name, and . indicates that the Dockerfile is in under the current directory. 3. After the build is complete, use the following command to start the container: docker run -itd --name container_name -p port:port image_name Among them, -itd means interactive container background startup, --name specifies the container name, -p specifies port mapping, image_name specifies the image name.
