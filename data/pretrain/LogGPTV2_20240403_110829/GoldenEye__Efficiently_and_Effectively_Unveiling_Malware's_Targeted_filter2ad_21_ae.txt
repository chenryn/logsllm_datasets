#### Introduction to GOLDENEYE and Its Functionality
GOLDENEYE is a dynamic analysis system designed to efficiently and effectively expose the targeted environments of malware. It achieves this by employing several new dynamic analysis techniques, such as parallel environment spaces construction and branch evaluation, which help in solving the technical challenges faced by targeted malware analysis.

#### Key Features and Capabilities
1. **Language and Keyboard Layout Detection:**
   - **GetKeyboardLayout:** GOLDENEYE can intercept and manipulate the results of API calls like `GetKeyboardLayout` to simulate different keyboard layouts. For example, it can make the malware believe it is running on a Ukrainian or Chinese system, thereby preventing infection if the malware is configured to avoid these environments.
   - **Bifrost Variants:** Some variants of Bifrost check the system language to determine if the OS is a Chinese system. GOLDENEYE can intelligently alter the query results to make the malware think it is running in its targeted environment.

2. **User Credentials:**
   - **Neloweg and Koobface:** Malware samples like Neloweg and Koobface target user credentials. Neloweg accesses the registry key `Microsoft/Internet Account Manager/Accounts`, which stores Outlook credentials. Koobface targets Facebook credentials. GOLDENEYE provides fake credentials, files, or registry entries to allow the malware to continue execution while capturing its malicious intentions.

3. **System Invariants:**
   - **Sality, Zeus, and Conficker:** These malware types use mutexes to prevent multiple infections. For instance, Sality uses a mutex named `uxJLpe1m`. The presence of such mutexes can disable the malware's execution. GOLDENEYE extracts this information, which is useful for malware prevention and analysis.

4. **Displayed Windows and Installed Libraries:**
   - **iBank Trojan:** This malware is sensitive to certain displayed windows and installed libraries. For example, iBank looks for the window "AVP.Root" (Kaspersky software) and accesses `avipc.dll` (Avira Anti-virus software). If these are detected, the malware attempts to kill the AV tools using the `AvIpcCall` function. GOLDENEYE helps in detecting such anti-AV behaviors.

5. **Hidden Dormant Functionality:**
   - **Qakbot:** This malware writes `qbothome qbotinj.exe` into the `CurrentVersion\Run` registry key. If the key does not exist, the malware enters a sleep routine. By changing the environment settings, GOLDENEYE can reveal hidden dormant functionalities, which can be useful for slowing down the spread of malware.

#### Distributed Deployment of GOLDENEYE
- **Performance Evaluation:**
  - **Case I:** Generate a parallel task for all environment-sensitive branches.
  - **Case II:** Generate a parallel task only when the branch evaluation cannot decide a branch after measuring the branch selection heuristics.
  - **Case III:** Do not generate a parallel task and do not conduct rolling back, using a single machine instead of distributed deployment.
- **Results:**
  - Case I and II expose over 30% more behaviors than Case III.
  - Case II has a lower standard deviation and higher utilization ratio, making it the most balanced configuration in terms of effectiveness and resource consumption.

#### Discussion
- **Path Selection/Prediction:**
  - The correctness of branch evaluation depends on the malware's behavior fitting the heuristics. Multi-round snapshot-and-recover analysis can be used but may cause higher overhead.
- **Taint Analysis:**
  - Taint analysis helps in preprocessing and speculative execution but can have limitations of over-tainting and under-tainting. However, GOLDENEYE's approach is still more lightweight and accurate.
- **Evasion Techniques:**
  - Malware can detect the existence of GOLDENEYE and inject APIs to mislead the analysis. However, GOLDENEYE's heuristics and rollback mechanisms can mitigate such evasion.
- **Environment-Uniqueness Malware:**
  - Some malware use environment primitives as decryption keys. While GOLDENEYE cannot fully analyze such malware, it can still provide valuable insights into the malware's behavior and potential decryption keys.

#### Conclusion
GOLDENEYE represents a significant step towards systematic environment-targeted malware analysis. It improves the performance trade-off compared to existing approaches and provides valuable insights into malware behavior. Further research is needed to address remaining challenges and enhance the system's capabilities.
