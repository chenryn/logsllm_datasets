### What problem does this feature solve?
Because large applications may have MANY custom directives in addition to
custom components, it makes sense to treat loading of external definitions
similarly.
Because the Vue.directive(name, bindOrUpdate) signature exists, we would have
to have another call signature, perhaps a 3rd argument?
### What does the proposed API look like?
    Vue.directive("my-attribute", null, function(resolve, reject){
      $.getScript("/vue/directives/my-attribute.directive.js").then(resolve, reject);
    });
