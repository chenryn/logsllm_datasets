Bug

**What is the current behavior?**
- Navigate to [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qjpBzw) (a modified version of the 'Controlled Components' documentation page that converts input characters to uppercase).
- Enter the letter 'a' into the input field; it will display as 'A'.
- Subsequently, enter the letter 'b'; the input will then show 'AAB'.

**What is the expected behavior?**  
The input should display 'AB'.

**Which versions of React, and which browser/OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
- The CodePen uses React version 15.6.1.
- The issue is specific to Firefox Mobile (tested on versions 53 and 54) and does not occur with the desktop version of Firefox.
- The bug only manifests when the input is converted to uppercase.
