We should have 'AB'
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
The CodePen uses React@15.6.1, and the bug only occurs with Firefox _mobile_
(not with the desktop version). I tested with FF53 and 54
The bug only occurs because i change the case.
