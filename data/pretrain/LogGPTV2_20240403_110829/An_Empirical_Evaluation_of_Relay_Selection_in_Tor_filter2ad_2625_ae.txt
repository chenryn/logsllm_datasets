is an indirect relationship between latency and bandwidth
when using TCP (as Tor does). Thus Coordinates actually
incorporates an (admittedly loose) proxy for bandwidth in
its selection.
Our results also indicate that the recently proposed LAS-
Tor relay selection strategy is unlikely to be effective on
the live Tor network. It is likely that the evaluation method
used by Akhoondi et al. of making HTTP HEAD requests
over LASTor paths did not realistically exercise the perfor-
mance of those paths: a HEAD request is generally less than
1 KB, while typical web pages are two orders of magnitude
larger [38]. Since LASTor does not take the bandwidth of re-
lays into account (we discuss proposed reﬁnements to LAS-
Tor that consider bandwidth next), its performance degrades
drastically when a realistic trafﬁc load is applied. We note
that our clean room implementation of LASTor does not in-
clude the AS awareness portion of the algorithm, although
Akhoondi et al. showed that AS awareness increased the la-
tency of instantiated paths so we believe it unlikely that its
inclusion would have improved performance.
Akhoondi et al. suggest reﬁnements to their basic LAS-
Tor strategy that omit relays whose bandwidth is less than
100 KBps from consideration. We evaluated this reﬁne-
ment, and showed that while this provides a signiﬁcant im-
provement in performance, LASTor still lags other strate-
gies. We present the details of this evaluation in the Ap-
pendix.
that
Finally, our results suggest
the addition of a
coordinate-based system to Tor may provide some incre-
mental advantage to relay selection. Tor+Coordinates ob-
tained a slight performance improvement over Tor under
most conditions, and rarely performed worse. Similarly the
performance of the Congestion-aware strategy suggests that
similar techniques provide a window of opportunity for in-
crementally improving Tor. While bandwidth remains the
most signiﬁcant indicator of performance, a layered ap-
proach which seeks to optimize latency and congestion as
well as throughput might be a beneﬁcial addition to Tor.
Since these techniques are largely orthogonal, future work
could explore the beneﬁts of further combination. Addi-
tional areas of future work include the development of de-
fenses to protect coordinate systems from manipulation.
8. Conclusion
We have shown the feasibility of building a topology
from Internet routing information that reasonably represents
the live Tor network and is reducible to a size viable for
emulation and other environments. Our models of the Tor
network enable whole-network comparative evaluation of
a set of relay selection methods. Our results indicate that
recently proposed algorithms that do not consider band-
width during relay selection result in poor performance.
The Congestion-aware strategy shows signiﬁcant promise,
especially in congested networks, and has little anonymity
14
impact. Our Tor+Coordinates selection method also offers
a modest improvement in both bandwidth and latency over
Tor’s default strategy. Additionally, we show the impor-
tance of full network evaluation when considering new re-
lay selection strategies, as performance in toto can differ
signiﬁcantly from the experience of a single client.
We anticipate that as emulation frameworks such as
Shadow and ExperimenTor mature and begin to support
larger topologies, the limitations of the 50-relay model can
be ameliorated by using larger models (such as our 1524-
relay model) for performance evaluation.

A LASTor proposed bandwidth
enhancement
We evaluated a variant of the bandwidth enhancement
proposed by Akhoondi et al. [2]. They reﬁne their ba-
sic LASTor strategy by restricting the relays chosen within
each gridsquare to only those relays that have a reported
bandwidth greater than 100 KBps. We implemented this re-
ﬁnement with one modiﬁcation due to the potentially small
number of relays per gridsquare in our emulation environ-
ment: we limit the set of paths to those in which a relay
meeting the 100 KBps bandwidth restriction is guaranteed
at each step.
Figure 13 shows the throughput and P-RTT of the modi-
ﬁed version of LASTor, under medium congestion with ho-
mogeneous clients. The proposed reﬁnement signiﬁcantly
increases the performance of LASTor (relative to the ver-
sion without the bandwidth constraint), but still results in
much worse performance than Tor and Tor+Coordinates.
