User: I am working in python on a GAE app. Beautiful soup, which the app uses, works fine on my dev server locally. When I try and upload it to google's servers however, I get the following error: "Error parsing yaml file: the library "bs4" is not supported".
I am not sure how to fix this. Does anyone have any idea?
Thank you.
File Structure:
app.yaml
main.py
static(DIR)
templates(DIR)
bs4(DIR)
Assistant: It seems uploading the whole directory where the bs4 module resides in to the GAE app folder would work.
