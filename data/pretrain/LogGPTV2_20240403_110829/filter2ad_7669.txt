## Abstract
This paper presents the traffic and delay patterns observed at short time-scales at the edge of a cellular mobile network. We find that high-rate sequential scanners in the Internet are a common source of traffic impulses, which introduce "noise" in one-way delay measurements.

## 1. Introduction
The primary motivation for this work was to use one-way delay measurements to detect drifts and hidden problems between measurement points. Higher-than-normal delay values can indicate capacity shortages or malfunctions in intermediate network elements. We analyzed one-way delays in the Core Network of an operational 3G mobile network in Austria, EU. The monitoring included all GGSNs and Edge Routers (ER) co-located at a single physical site. For a detailed description of the network structure and monitoring setup, refer to [1]. This study focuses on downlink traffic, i.e., traffic directed towards Mobile Stations (MS). The one-way delay was extracted using a methodology similar to that described in [2], where selected fields in the TCP/IP headers are hashed and matched across different sections. Here, we summarize our initial findings.

## 2. Findings
### 2.1 Delay Patterns
In Figure 1, we plot the delay samples through the Gi section (from the peering links to the GGSNs, as shown in [1, Fig. 1]) measured during one hour of moderate load. As expected, most delay samples are very low, below 1 ms. However, we also observe large delay values, up to 200 ms, concentrated into vertical lines (spikes) scattered uniformly throughout the day. Similar delay patterns were observed within the GGSN (not reported here due to space constraints; see [1, Fig. 3]). These delay spikes are likely associated with traffic bursts. The downlink traffic rate, measured in 1-second bins, shows spikes (positive impulses) scattered throughout the day. Manual inspection revealed that the primary cause of these traffic spikes is sequential scanning activity.

### 2.2 Impact of Sequential Scanners
Probe packets from high-rate sequential scanners arrive at local peering links in a pattern shaped by the address space allocation of the local network (see [1] for details). In Figure 2, we report the packet rate measured at different network sections for traffic originating from a single external IP address identified as a high-rate sequential scanner (referred to as "S"). The probe packets arrive in short-duration bursts, corresponding to a relatively high bitrate (undisclosed). We found several active scanners, both persistent and non-persistent, using different packet types (e.g., TCP SYN, UDP). When non-blocked ports are used, the scanning bursts penetrate into the Core Network, as public addressing is used for the MS.

### 2.3 Micro-congestion
Comparing Figures 2(a) and 2(b), we see that a significant fraction of the probe packets (up to 80%) is lost in the Gi path (ER → GGSN) due to micro-congestion caused by the scanning traffic itself. Comparing Figures 2(b) and 2(c), we see that only a fraction of the packets seen on Gi reach the Gn links, i.e., pass through the GGSN. The GGSN forwards only packets directed to active IP addresses, currently assigned to MS within active connections (PDP-contexts). Therefore, the penetration of scanning traffic into Gn varies with the time of day, being low at night and highest during peak hours when more MS are active. Notably, some MS respond to incoming probes (e.g., with ICMP "port unreachable"), causing backscatter traffic in the uplink.

### 2.4 Detailed Analysis of Scanning Bursts
Scanning bursts were clipped inside the Gi section due to hitting the capacity limit of some internal link. To illustrate this, we zoom into a sample scanning burst from source S. We divide the delay samples into two groups: scanning packets (identified by the IP address of S) and other traffic ("filtered"). These are plotted separately in Figure 3(a) against the time-axis. Focusing on the "scanning" samples, the delay pattern is consistent with a buffer that fills up rapidly (initial slope) and then remains persistently saturated (plateau). After the fill-up phase, most arriving packets are lost, while those entering the buffer experience an approximately constant delay equal to the buffer depletion time (≈ 20 ms in this case). Following this phase, we observe a cluster of delay samples around 200 ms, followed by an empty period of ≈ 200 ms where no packets are seen. This pattern is consistent with the so-called "coffee-break" event [2], indicating a temporary interruption of the packet forwarding process at some intermediate router. In our traces, such events occur only during large scanning bursts, suggesting that the observed coffee-breaks are not due to normal router dynamics but rather a symptom of short-term CPU congestion. Note that in Figure 3(a), the whole delay pattern described for the scanning packets is followed by the other traffic as well ("filtered" series), indicating that the micro-congested resources (buffer, CPU) are shared by all traffic. Thus, the scanning traffic causes a small impairment to other legitimate traffic.

### 2.5 Other Phenomena
Besides micro-congestion, we observed other interesting phenomena related to scanning traffic:
- **Traffic Notches:** The total traffic rate in the core network (Gi, Gn links) displays notches, i.e., negative impulses, when measured at small timescales (1 sec bins, see [1, Fig. 4]). Further investigations revealed a close correlation with the scanning process, suggesting that high-rate scanning bursts can locally reduce the arrival rate of legitimate traffic.
- **Uplink Packing:** The presence of scanning traffic in the downlink impacts the uplink traffic pattern. In Figure 3(b), we show the uplink traffic originated by all MS as observed at the peering links, measured as packet counts in 1 ms timebins. During scanning periods, uplink packets are transmitted in discontinuous bursts, corresponding to large distinct spikes in the packet count. A possible explanation is that the CPU at some internal node is kept busy by the scanning traffic for a few milliseconds, starving the uplink forwarding process. During such vacancy periods, arriving uplink packets are buffered, and when the CPU becomes available, they are forwarded at once, "packed" into a single burst. Most uplink packets are TCP ACKs, which could lead to TCP synchronization effects at small timescales.

## 3. Conclusions and Future Work
We found that Internet traffic contains large bursts of packets from high-rate sequential scanning activities. Large access networks employing public IP addressing, including 3G cellular networks, are permeable to such scanning bursts. The impact of these activities on the underlying network infrastructure may not be fully understood. Our initial observations, specific to the particular network under study, suggest that the network dynamics triggered by such traffic are non-trivial and warrant further investigation. We showed that scanning traffic introduces "shot-noise" into delay measurements due to micro-congestion events. This noise complicates the task of using delay statistics to validate the health status of network elements and should be considered when interpreting real-world delay measurements.
