## Abstract
QR (Quick Response) codes have gained popularity due to their large storage capacity, ease of generation and distribution, and fast readability. However, users typically cannot discern the content encoded in a QR code, often a URL, until after scanning it. This makes QR codes an ideal medium for attackers to conceal and launch attacks based on malicious URLs. We believe that enhancing the security features of QR code scanners is the most effective way to detect and prevent such attacks. Despite this, little attention has been given to the security features of QR code scanners in existing literature. In this paper, we investigate the current status of QR code scanners in terms of their detection of malicious URLs used in phishing and malware attacks. Our results show that existing scanners either fail to detect or poorly detect these attacks. To address this, we propose a solution called SafeQR, which leverages two existing security APIs—Google Safe Browsing API and Phishtank API—to enhance the detection rate of malicious URLs. Additionally, we designed and implemented a visual warning scheme to help users better understand and heed warnings. A user study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing QR code scanner methods.

## 1. Introduction
With the widespread adoption of smartphones, various services have been developed and integrated into these devices. Quick Response (QR) codes, one of these services, have become popular due to their easy generation, distribution, large storage capacity, and fast readability. They are commonly found on public signage, directing users to websites with more information about products, companies, or locations. According to a recent survey, 75% of retailers now offer customers this 2D technology to interact with and track potential buyers. Customers can scan QR codes using their smartphones or tablets to receive coupons, discounts, or other product-related information.

However, the machine-readable nature of QR codes means that users can only determine the encoded information by scanning them. This makes QR codes an ideal medium for attackers to conceal and launch attacks based on malicious contents, such as phishing URLs. Additionally, people's curiosity often leads them to scan unknown QR codes, making them a significant hidden security threat. Despite this, little attention has been paid to the security features of QR code scanners in the literature.

In this paper, we investigate the current status of QR code scanners in terms of their detection of malicious URLs used in phishing and malware attacks. Our results show that existing scanners either cannot detect or poorly detect these attacks. Therefore, we propose a solution called SafeQR, which enhances the detection rate of malicious URLs by leveraging the Google Safe Browsing API and Phishtank API. We also design and implement a visual warning scheme to better inform users of potential threats. Finally, we conduct a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing QR code scanner methods.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
- **Section 2** discusses the potential threats posed by QR codes and reveals the problems with existing QR code applications on Android phones.
- **Section 3** presents our approach to addressing these issues.
- **Section 4** details the methodology and design of the user study, along with the results.
- **Section 5** concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Potential Threats of QR Codes
QR codes typically direct users to websites of interest, providing further information or services. However, by scanning a carefully manipulated QR code, users may be redirected to a malicious website. Two critical types of attacks we focus on in this study are phishing and malware attacks.

- **Phishing**: Phishing tricks users into divulging sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity. A QR code can redirect users to a fake bank website, where they unknowingly provide their information to attackers.
- **Malware**: Malicious QR codes can redirect users to URLs containing malware. For example, users have been tricked into scanning a QR code and downloading a malicious application that sends multiple text messages to a premium-rate number, charging users $5 per message.

Other types of attacks, such as social engineering and cross-site attacks, are also possible but were not the focus of this study.

### 2.2 Defects of Existing QR Code Readers

#### 2.2.1 Security-Related Features of QR Code Apps
We investigated the security-related features of existing QR code scanners available on the Google Play Store. On June 6, 2012, we searched for QR code scanning apps using keywords like "QR code," "QR code reader," and "QR code scanner." We found 31 apps and installed them on an HTC Nexus One running Android 2.3.6. We then scanned QR codes with benign URLs from DMOZ and malicious URLs from PhishTank to evaluate the features of these scanners.

Table 1 summarizes the security-related features of the QR code scanners. Notably, 74.19% (23/31) of the apps included a user confirmation feature, which displays the decoded URL and allows users to decide whether to continue to the website. Two readers, QR Droid and QR Droid Private, also had a preview feature, showing a preview of the scanned website. Another app, QuickMark, provided usage data, including the total number of scans and the click rate.

Our study results indicate that while many QR code scanners include user confirmation features, they lack robust security warnings and preview capabilities, leaving users vulnerable to attacks.
