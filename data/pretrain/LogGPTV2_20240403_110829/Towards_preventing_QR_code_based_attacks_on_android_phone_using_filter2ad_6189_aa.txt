ABSTRACT 
QR  (Quick  Response)  code  has  become  quite  popular  in  recent 
years  due  to  its  large  storage  capacity,  ease  of  generation  and 
distribution,  and  fast  readability.  However,  it  is  not  likely  that 
users will be able to find out easily the content encoded, typically 
URLs,  until  after  they  scan  QR  codes.  This  makes  QR  codes  a 
perfect medium for attackers to conceal and launch their attacks 
based on malicious URLs. We believe that security hardening on 
QR code scanners is the most effective way to detect and prevent 
the  potential  attacks  exploiting  QR  codes.  However,  little 
attention  has  been  paid  to  the  security  features  of  QR  code 
scanners  so  far  in  literature.  In  this  paper,  we  investigated  the 
current  status  of  existing  QR  code  scanners  in  terms  of  their 
detection  of  malicious  URLs  exploited  for  two  well-known 
attacks:  phishing  and  malware.  Our  study  results  show  the 
existing  scanners  either  cannot  detect  or  can  very  poorly  detect 
those two attacks. Hence, we propose a QR code solution called 
SafeQR  that  enhances  the  detection  rate  of  malicious  URLs  by 
leveraging  two  existing  security  APIs  to  detect  phishing  and 
malware attacks: Google Safe Browsing API and Phishtank API. 
Additionally, a visual warning scheme was carefully designed and 
implemented to enable users to better heed warnings. A user study 
was  designed  and  conducted  to  investigate  the  effectiveness  of 
our scheme compared with the methods adopted by existing QR 
code scanners.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
As  smartphones  have  become  very  popular  recently,  more  and 
more services based on smartphones have been being developed 
and  adopted.  Quick  response  codes  (QR  codes),  as  one  of  such 
services, have been widely used due to their easy generation and

distribution, large storage capacity, and fast readability [1]. They 
are  often  found  on  public  signage,  usually  to  direct  users  to  a 
website  with  more  information  about  a  product,  company,  or 
location. According to a recent survey, 75% of retailers now offer 
customers this 2D technology to interact with and track potential 
buyers [2]. Customers can scan them with QR code scanners on 
their smart phone or tablet to receive coupons, discounts, or other 
information related to products or services. 
However,  due  to  the  fact  that  their  encoding  scheme  is  more 
machine-readable than human-readable, the only way for users to 
figure out what information is encoded in a QR code is to scan it. 
This makes QR codes a perfect medium for attackers to conceal 
and  launch  their  attacks  based  on  malicious  contents  embedded 
such  as  phishing  URLs  [3].  Besides,  people  often  cannot  resist 
their own curiosity to scan the codes they have come across. This 
innate obfuscation of QR codes and the curiosity make QR codes 
one  of  the  biggest  hidden  security  threats  [4].  So  far,  little 
attention  has  been  paid  to  the  security  features  of  QR  code 
scanners  in  literature.  In  this  paper,  we  investigated  the  current 
status of existing QR code scanners in terms of their detection of 
malicious  URLs  exploited  for  two  well-known  attacks:  phishing 
and  malware.  Our  study  results  show  that  the  existing  scanners 
either cannot detect or can very poorly detect those two attacks. 
Hence,  we  propose  a  QR  code  solution  called  SafeQR  that 
enhances the detection rate of malicious URLs by leveraging two 
existing  security  APIs  for  effectively  dealing  with  phishing  and 
malware attacks: Google Safe Browsing API and Phishtank API. 
Additionally,  our  solution  offers  an  effective  visual  warning 
scheme to help users better informed of imminent threats. Finally, 
an experiment involving a user study was designed and conducted 
to investigate the effectiveness of our scheme compared with the 
methods adopted by existing QR code scanners. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses 
the potential threats in QR codes, and reveals the problems of the 
existing  QR  code  applications  on  Android  phone.  Section  3 
presents our approach to tackle the existing problems. Section 4 
discusses the methodology and design of a user study developed 
to test the effectiveness of our approach as well as some results 
from the user study. Section 5 concludes the paper with our future 
research work. 
2.  BACKGROUND 
In this section, we first discuss the main potential threats brought 
about by QR codes, and then we present our study results which 
show that the vast majority of Android-based QR code scanners 
did  not  provide  users  any  security  information  for  the  scanned 
URLs.  
3412.1  Potential Threats of QR Codes 
Usually, a QR code directs users to the website of their interest, 
which can provide further information or services. By scanning a 
carefully manipulated QR code, however, they may be taken to a 
malicious website. Attackers can use QR codes for various types 
of attacks. However, two critical attacks we are interested in for 
this study are phishing and malware attacks.  
• 
Phishing: phishing is an activity that tricks people to divulge 
their sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy 
entity [5, 6]. A QR code can redirect users to a fake bank that 
looks  exactly  like  the  real  bank.  A  normal  user  cannot  see 
the differences and type in his or her information and hand it 
to the attackers [7-9]. 
•  Malware: A malicious QR code can be used to redirect users 
to  a  URL  containing  malware[3].  An  early  example  of 
malware  attacks  through  QR  code  was  that  people  were 
fooled  into  scanning  a  QR  code  and  downloading  a 
malicious application, which sent off multiple text messages 
to a number that charged users $5 per SMS message [10].  
There are other types of attacks such as social engineering [7, 11] 
and cross-site attacks [12]. Though interesting, a complete study 
to analyze these rather rare cases was out of purview of our study. 
2.2  Defects of Existing QR Code Readers 
QR  code  scanners  are  the  only  direct  way  to  detect  QR  code 
based  attacks.  In  this  study,  we  first  investigated  the  security 
related  features  of  existing  QR  code  scanners,  and  then  focused 
on the detection rates of existing QR code scanners with security 
indicators.  
2.2.1  Security Related Features of QR Code Apps 
Google  Play,  the  official  Android  Market,  is  used  as  a  reliable 
source  for  users  to  download  the  apps.  On  Jun  6,  2012,  we 
searched  for  QR  code  scanning  apps  from  Google  Play  market 
using  keywords  “QR  code”,  “QR  code  reader”,  and  “QR  code 
scanner,”  and  we  found  31  apps.  We  installed  them  in  a  HTC 
Nexus One with Android 2.3.6 and used them to scan QR codes 
with  benign  URLs  randomly  chosen  from  DMOZ  [13],  a 
manually  edited  directory,  and  QR  codes  with  malicious  URLs 
selected  from  PhishTank  [14],  a  blacklist  of  phishing  URLs,  to 
find out the features of these scanners.  
Table  1  shows  the  results  of  our  study  on  the  security  related 
features of those scanners.  Due  to  the  space  limitation,  we  only 
listed the software names. Though the names (Barcode Scanner) 
of No. 2 and No. 3 are the same, No. 2 scanner was developed by 
ZXing Team, while No. 3 was developed by George Android.              
As we can see from Table 1, 74.19% (23/31) of the apps had a 
feature  called  user  confirmation.  The  user  confirmation  feature 
provides  users  with  a  confirmation  page  that  displays  the  URL 
encoded 
to 
continue/discontinue to visit the website. This allows users to find 
out where they will visit, and thus offers a way to involve users to 
potentially  prevent  attacks  by  inspecting  the  decoded  URL. 
Interestingly, two readers, QR Droid and QR Droid Private, had 
an additional feature called preview. The preview feature provides 
the preview of the scanned website so that users will be able to 
figure  out  roughly  if  the  site  is  actually  the  one  that  they  are 
the  QR  code,  along  with  an  option 
in 
initially  interested  in  (this  is  especially  true  in  case  that  they 
actually  visited  the  site  previously.).  On  the  other  hand,  an  app 
called QuickMark had an interesting utility function based on the 
history of QR code usage. The function displays two usage data: 
Scan and Click Rate. The first is the total number of times that a 
QR code has been scanned using this app, and the second pertains 
to  the  number  of  times  a  QR  code  has  been  clicked  divided  by 
Scan.
