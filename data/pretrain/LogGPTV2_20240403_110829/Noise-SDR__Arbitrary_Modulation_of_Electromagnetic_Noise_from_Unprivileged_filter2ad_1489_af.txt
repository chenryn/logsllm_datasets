Fig. 14. Reception with USPR B210 of a GLONASS C/A Code sent at 800.875 MHz

research could try to inject the 1.6 GHz harmonic directly in the GNSS receiver.
ensure that the lock at reception is valid, we: (i) did not overfit the
lock/tracking parameters of the default configuration of the gnss-sdr
receiver, (ii) observed that the lock occurs only when transmission
is on, (iii) observed that the lock always corresponds to the expected
satellite for different choices of the tuning frequency. Third, Noise-
SDR could be used to modulate radio carriers intentionally emitted
by the circuit leveraging effects like Screaming Channels [42],
[43], and building a Second-Order Soft-TEMPEST [40], [41]. For
example, we were already able to leverage the carrier emitted by the
Near Field Communication (NFC) reader of a Nokia 3.1 to transmit
data with PSK31. Fourth, phase modulation and DSSS open new
directions for research on localization (e.g., Doppler of moving
targets) and/or undetectable secret transmissions (below the noise
floor and with cryptographically secure spreading codes [128]).
Fifth, Noise-SDR is a general approach that could be extended to
other types of physical leakage. Finally, leakage control could be
achieved without explicit code execution. For example, a website
could download and display an image to control the screen’s leakage,
or memory accesses could be triggered with GPU-accelerated
rendering in the browser [55], or by sending WiFi packets [129].
X. CONCLUSION AND REPLICABILITY
We have presented Noise-SDR, a software-defined fully-digital ap-
proach to obtain a high degree of control on electromagnetic leakage
compared to previous work. Despite some limitations on frequency
and bandwidth, Noise-SDR achieves arbitrary modulation in ampli-
tude, frequency, and phase. Like an SDR, Noise-SDR modulates a
generic baseband signal generated in software on an electromagnetic
leakage acting as carrier. This way, theoretical and practical
knowledge in radio communications (e.g., advanced techniques,
high-performance protocols, state-of-the-art tools) becomes readily
available to the attacker. Noise-SDR has a fundamental impact on
emission security for two main reasons. First, attackers can establish
advanced communication channels that were previously thought
unavailable to unprivileged software. Second, attackers can leverage
SDR tools to use existing high-performance radio protocols without
any knowledge or effort, or to design complex custom solutions.
To ensure the replicability of our results, Noise-SDR is open source
and available at: https://github.com/eurecom-s3/noise-sdr.
