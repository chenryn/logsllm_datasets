INTUITION UNDERLYING R2-F2
R2-F2’s primary objective is to infer wireless channels on
a target frequency band, given the wireless channels on a
different frequency band. In order to achieve this objective,
R2-F2 relies on the observation that the channels are the di-
rect result of the signal paths. While the channels change
Figure 3: Transforming Signal Paths to Channels on Two Frequency Bands:
(a) Consider two signal paths emerging
from 80◦ and 105◦ as shown. Their corresponding attenuations are: a1, a2, distances traversed are d1, d2, and phase offsets
due to reﬂectors (or lack there-of) φ1, φ2. (b)-(b’) Depicts the signal components of individual paths across angle-of-arrival.
We observe two spikes at 80◦ and 105◦ as expected scaled by the respective path amplitudes. The peaks differ only in phase.
(c)-(c’) Incorporates the windowing effect that causes the peaks to be convolved with sinc functions. The red and blue sinc
correspond to the red and blue path. Further, the width of the sincs changes with frequency. (d)-(d’) Depicts the superposition
of the sinc functions in both frequency bands. The two plots look very different – both due to the difference in shape of the sincs
as well as the difference in their phases. (e)-(e’) Denotes the wireless channels obtained after applying the Fourier Transform
on the two bands – two different sets of values.
across frequencies, the underlying paths stay the same. Thus,
if one could obtain a frequency-invariant representation of
signal paths from wireless channels on any given frequency,
one can recreate an estimate of the channels at any other fre-
quency of interest.
But what is a frequency-independent representation of sig-
nal paths that can be mapped to (and from) wireless chan-
nels? The answer to this question lies in Eqn. 3, which
deﬁnes wireless channels based on underlying propagation
paths. Speciﬁcally, wireless channels hi depend on four dis-
tinct attributes of signal paths: (1) Their attenuation an; (2)
Their frequency-independent phase φn, that distinguishes the
direct path from reﬂected paths; (3) Their angle of arrival θn;
(4) The distance they traverse dn. These four quantities, when
listed for each path, fully deﬁne the wireless channels on any
given frequency. More importantly, none of these parameters
depend on the frequency at which the channel is obtained.
In other words set of four-tuples of the form (an, φn, θn, dn)
is a natural representation of signal paths that is frequency-
invariant.
Now that we have a representation of signal paths, we
need to understand how to extract it given wireless chan-
nels on any frequency. To do so, observe that wireless chan-
nels in Eqn. 3 take the form of the familiar discrete Fourier
transform (parameterized by spatial angle-of-arrival cos θ).
In particular, this Fourier transform takes as input quantities
that depend directly on our signal path four-tuples. Since the
discrete Fourier transform is invertible, one might wonder if
we can simply apply the inverse Fourier transform to retrieve
the signal paths given wireless channels. Unfortunately, our
task is not this simple. This is because, upon inverting the
Fourier transform, we get quantities that depend not just on
our signal path four-tuples, but also the frequency. As a re-
sult, teasing apart signal four-tuples from wireless channels
requires removing this dependency on frequency.
To understand how to achieve this, it is instructive to study
how the same signal 4-tuples manifest as different wire-
less channels on two different frequencies, say 600MHz and
650MHz. We do so in the context of a speciﬁc example. Con-
sider Fig. 3(a) which depicts signals from the phone to the
base station traversing two paths. Let the corresponding sig-
nal path 4-tuples be: (a1, φ1, θ1 = 80o, d1 = 19.5m) and
(a2, φ2, θ2 = 105o, d2 = 23m). These undergo four distinct
transformations, inclusive of the Fourier transform, before
they become the overall wireless channels on the two fre-
quencies (from Fig. 3(a) to (e)-(e’)) as described below:
• Phase Variation (Fig. 3(a) to (b)-(b’)): We ﬁrst be-
gin by mapping the signal path 4-tuples to inputs of the
Fourier tranform. Recall from Eqn. 3 that these inputs are
simply the wireless channel components along individual
paths at the two frequencies. Fig. 3(b)-(b’) visualizes the
amplitude and phase of the signal components from the
two paths across angle-of-arrival. As expected, both these
plots have two spikes that correspond to the two paths,
scaled by their respective attenuations. In fact, the two

inversely with the wavelength of the two bands.
• Windowing Effect (Fig. 3(b)-(b’) to (c)-(c’)): Before we
can apply the Fourier transform, we need to account for
an effect that occurs since the cellular base station has a
limited number of antennas (5 in our example). Speciﬁ-
cally, this means that the base station samples the signal
from the two paths within a window of space (the space
between the ﬁrst and last antenna). Since the channels are
observed only within a window of space, the signal’s an-
gles of arrival are convolved with a sinc function. This is
a standard property of the Fourier transform: multiplying
by a window in one domain translates into a convolution
with a sinc in the other domain. Thus each impulse from
the corresponding angle as in Fig. 3(b) and (b’) is trans-
formed as a sinc function as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (c’).
The convolution with a sinc makes the signal look differ-
ent across frequencies. Speciﬁcally, the precise shape of
the sinc changes with the transmission frequency. This is
because the distances between antennas are measured rel-
evant to the wavelength of the transmission signal. Hence,
at higher frequency the distance between antennas seem
larger and the sinc narrower.
• Superposition (Fig. 3(c)-(c’) to (d)-(d’)): At this point,
the signals components from different paths super-impose
at the receiver. Thus, the base station gets a super-position
of the blue and red sincs in Fig. 3(b) and (b’), scaled by
their respective phases that (as described earlier) are dif-
ferent. This results in Fig. 3(d) and (d’) that now look sig-
niﬁcantly different.
• Fourier Transform (Fig. 3(d)-(d’) to (e)-(e’)): Finally,
we apply the Fourier transform to take our super-imposed
sincs in Fig. 3(d) and (d’) to the wireless channels sampled
at the ﬁve antenna locations, and shown in Fig. 3(e) and
(e’).
Thus, if we want to move from wireless channels to their
underlying signal paths, we must invert this whole process.
We need to: (1) Invert the Fourier transform; (2) Separate the
super-imposed sincs; and (3) Undo the windowing effect; (4)
Correct for the difference in phase between the two frequen-
cies. In the next section, we describe this process mathemat-
ically and formulate it as an L-2 minimization problem.
5. ALGORITHM
In this section, we formalize the discussion in §4. We be-
gin by formalizing mathematically the transform between
wireless channels and signal paths. We then invert the effects
of this transform by formulating the problem as an L-2 op-
timization whose solution results in the frequency-invariant
signal path characteristics. These paths are then used to infer
the channels on a desired band.
5.1 Transforming Physical Paths to Wireless Channels
Let us assume that the signal from the user to the K-
antenna base station arrives along N distinct paths. The an-
tennas are indexed by 0, 1, . . . , K − 1 and l is the inter-

antenna separation.3 Further, let us denote the signal path
4-tuple of the nth path to be (an, φn, θn, dn). The setup (with
just one path) is illustrated in Fig. 4.
We now present the mathematical formulations of the in-
dividual transforms described in §4, between our signal path
representation and wireless channels (see Fig. 3).
• Phase Variation: Since the Fourier transform described
in equation 3 operates on the cos θ domain, we discuss
the algorithm in terms of cos θ. Let us denote ψ = cos θ.
Then, the contribution of the nth path to the directional
representation of the signal at wavelength, λ1 can be given
by:
1(ψ) = ane−j 2πdn
Pn
λ1
+jφn δ(ψ − ψn),
(4)
where Pn
1(ψ) represents the signal component along di-
rection ψ and δ(.) is the impulse function. φn denotes the
phase accumulated by the nth path by virtue of undergo-
ing reﬂections, an is the amplitude of the path as received
on antenna 0 and ψn = cos θn. This representation corre-
sponds to the representation in Figs. 3(b) and (b’).
• Windowing Effect: As described before,
the signal
sensed by the antenna array along different spatial di-
rections is the inverse Fourier transform of the channel
measurements on the different antennas of the antenna ar-
ray. Since the antennas on the base station sample a ﬁnite
space, it is equivalent to applying a window on the an-
tenna domain of width L
, where L (= Kl) is the width

of the antenna array. This creates a sinc in the spatial di-
rection domain, i.e. the path directions get convolved with

This equation mathematically represents Fig. 3(d)-(d’).
• Discrete Fourier Transform: Finally, the channel mea-

of the signal arriving along spatial directions. In order to
represent this mathematically, observe that equation 6 can

Equation 7 follows from equation 8 by using the convolu-

The above four transformations can be summarized suc-
cinctly as a sequence of matrix operations. Speciﬁcally,
given that the antennas are positioned at K discrete loca-
tions in space, we can now represent the Fourier transform
by a matrix multiplication. Let us deﬁne F to be the K × K
Fourier matrix, such that Fij(cid:48) = e−j 2πilj(cid:48) ψ(cid:48)

the discretization on the variable ψ (ψ(cid:48) = 2

Observe that, in the vector notation, the ith component of S(cid:126)a(cid:48)

is nothing but P3(iψ(cid:48)). In summary, we now have a transform
that maps signal paths to channels.

trix and ψ(cid:48) = λ

5.2 From Wireless Channels to Paths
Now that we understand, how the channels are derived
from the underlying physical paths, the goal is to ﬁnd a way
to invert this mechanism. In other words, given channel mea-
surements, (cid:126)h1 on wavelength λ1, we need to identify the un-
derlying physical paths. We do so by inverting the individual
components of the transform – the Fourier Transform, win-
dowing and super-position and phase variations.
Inverting the Fourier Transform: The ﬁrst step is to in-
vert the effect of the Fourier transform, which is simply the
inverse Fourier transform on the channel measurements, (cid:126)h1.
This can be achieved by multiplying (cid:126)h1 by F−1.
Inverting Windowing and Superposition: Next, we need
to invert the superposition effect, stated in equation 6 and
the windowing effect from equation 5. These two effects are
jointly represented by the matrix multiplication, S(cid:126)a(cid:48)
1 in equa-
tion 9. The goal is to infer S and (cid:126)a(cid:48)
1, given the perceived
