Existing Works
Fig. 21(a), shows our classi(cid:27)cation error rate over di(cid:29)erent δav❕ for
all 5000 houses in Irish dataset with ρmal = 40%. To understand
how it compares with existing works, Table 3 describes perfor-
mance of other works in terms of various parameters such as False
alarms(FA), Missed Detection(MD), learning type (S=supervised,
SU=semi-supervised), and time to detection. Apart from this, we
also qualitatively compare the level of privacy intrusion and com-
plexity compared to other schemes.
Fig. 21(a) shows that the worst case false alarm (FA) and missed
detection (MD) rate for δav❕ = 350W is 18% and 9%. At δav❕ = 400

Figure 21: Classi(cid:27)cation Performance with Scalability (a) All
5000 houses over δav❕ (b) 200 houses over ρmal
(used in [9] over the same dataset,did not report ρmal ), our work
with FA = 13.8% and MD = 9.3% outperforms [9] at a high ρmal
value. At δav❕ = 600W, we have FA = 6% and MD = 5% out-
performing [1] that reported FA=9% and MD=8% but over a much
smaller set of 200 houses without scalability evidence and higher
δav❕ of 700W-800W that favors good performance. False alarms
increase with decreasing δav❕ and below 400 it increases more, be-
cause the standard deviation of the dataset usually range around
400W . To our best knowledge, only [19] using a synthetic data re-
ported lesser error rates than us. But this happens only if number
of users are less than, 25 making this comparison unfair and there-
fore not scalable. Apart from this, [11] reports detection of around
90%, but for δav❕ as high as 1200W to 1800W , which will facilitate
easy detection in our case anyway.
Fig. 21(b), shows our classi(cid:27)cation error rate over di(cid:29)erent ρmal
values for a smaller dataset of 200 houses in Texas. It can be seen
that missed detection and false alarm rates are less than 2% and 5%,
upto ρmal = 0.60. Above ρmal > 65%, the performance degrades,
but missed detection rates are still lower at 13% and 25%, where
other works fail completely. A smaller population is chosen since
realistic attack budgets may become a signi(cid:27)cant ρmal percentage
for the smaller micro-grids sizes, making such a study practical.

7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We conclude that Harmonic to Arithmetic Mean ratios is an ef-
fective light weight indicator of organized falsi(cid:27)cation over di(cid:29)er-
ent types of falsi(cid:27)cation attack and robust under higher fractions
of compromised meters while distinguishing legitimate changes
in the data to malicious ones and helps in consensus correction.
A semi-supervised folded gaussian trust model produces trust val-
ues, which identi(cid:27)es meters launching both organized or isolated
attacks within a few days of attack, while preserving lower missed
detections and false alarms rates, even when percentage of compro-
mised meters are signi(cid:27)cantly higher. We showed that the method
is generic and applicable across di(cid:29)erent real smart meter datasets.
In future, we will extend our work to attacks where δav❕  {(|xi − µ| + σ q N
khi❕h > |xi − µ| + σ 2
N −1 ) + µ)} − xi , and
B DAILY STANDARD DEVIATION
DISTRIBUTION
The Fig. 22, shows the probability bar plot for SDav❕ (T ) for the
Texas dataset. We see that in most cases under no attacks, the prob-
ability of SDav❕ (T ), being between 425W-475W, centered around
450W is 0.52. Probabilities of all other ranges are much lesser.
Hence, the mode of the distribution is a reasonable approximation
for σM R , under attacks being con(cid:27)rmed.

C STEALTHY PERSISTENT ATTACKS
Fig. 23, shows an example that our ratio metric may work even un-
der ultra-stealthy margins of false data. Here ρmal = 40% and δav❕
is as low as 50W , where our attack was implemented from the 41st
day. We estimated that this ρmal ,δav❕ will cause deviation less
than the ϵ with all the knowledge we possessed. Indeed, this works
well for most of the time, but is not guaranteed to escape detection
altogether, since all the meters whether compromised or not have
erratically changing data that is di(cid:28)cult to predict beforehand. In
future work, we will propose a mathematical detection criterion
for such stealthy attacks.
Targeted one sided attacks, may happen theoretically, where at-
tack only attacks datapoints greater than the mean, then the obser-
vations will reversed. Deductive attacks may show an increase in
ratio, but in this case it will be restricted to only attacking 36% of
the total datapoints which restricts the attack signi(cid:27)cantly.

D COST BENEFIT UNDER MISSED
DETECTION
The revenue of an adversary per day who has M undetected me-
δav ❕×M×η×E
1000
, where η is the number of
ters is given by: RR =
reports a day, and E = $0.12 is the average per unit (KW-Hour)
cost of electricity in USA. In [29, 30] mentioned that cost of com-
promising the smart meter is about $500, in the puerto rico attack.
Here, utility maintainance personnel asked for $300 − $700 from
di(cid:29)erent customers and hacked their meters that reported lesser
power consumption, and promised bene(cid:27)t over time. The optimal
laser probes used for those attacks vary around 400. Therefore,
for compromising 80 meters, the attack cost is about $40, 000. At
δav❕ = 300, we have missed detection of 42 meters, hence the
revenue for attacker is $36/day. At this rate, it would take about 3
years to recover the attack cost $40, 000. For δav❕ = 350, only 7 me-
ters remain undetected by our method, with an average revenue of
$6/day. At this rate, it will take 18 years to recover the attack cost.
In future, we will explore how to identify meters reliably which
have δav❕ < 300W. That study will be useful if the attacker de-
vises/o(cid:29)ers novel cheaper ways of attack. Also, note that in terms
of time to detection also our work is quicker (less than 10 days)
compared to existing works. Hence, an attacker who does not in-
tend to remain undetected, is not able to gain much attack revenue.
