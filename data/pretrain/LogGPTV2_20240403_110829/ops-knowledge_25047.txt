User: I had created an application in Python and then I tried to make an executable from it.
Works well in Ubuntu and Windows but only when on this system I have Python installed.
In other case (Tried only for Win) I get the error that "The application can't start because python34.dll is missing"
What I do (filename is curr.py, also I have icon.res for icon):

python C:\Python34\Scripts\cython-script.py --embed curr.py
in curr.c replace wmain by main (without doing it app won't be compiled at all)
gcc curr.c -o curr.exe -IC:\Python34\include -LC:\Python34\libs icon.res -lpython34 -mwindows --static

Of course, If I copy python34.dll to the app's folder everything is OK. 
Do I have another way?
Assistant: Just installed PyInstaller - it has the option to compile to one file.
