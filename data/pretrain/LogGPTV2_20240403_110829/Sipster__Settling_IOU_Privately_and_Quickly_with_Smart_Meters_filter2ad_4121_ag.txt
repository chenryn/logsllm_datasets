A PRIVACY-PRESERVING AGGREGATION
Bill generation is considered as a special case of aggregation [34].
Each user can mask the readings before submitting them to the
company. The masks can be obtained through collaboration among
all users [35], such that the aggregated masks can be canceled with
each other, but it incurs heavy communication overhead. Acs and
Castelluccia [3] employ a differential-privacy model in which the
user adds carefully designed noise to the reading to hide the real
value. The utility company can then obtain the sum of the noisy
readings. This can be seen as sacrificing data accuracy for privacy.
Garcia and Jacobs [31] homomorphically encrypt secret shares
of the measurements to each member in the aggregation group.
With homomorphism, every user can obtain an aggregated share
encrypted under the public key. The user then sends the decryption
result of the aggregated shares to the utility company, who finally
obtains the total consumption over all users without knowing in-
dividual measurements. Erkin and Tsudik [30] develop another
aggregation scheme using encryption as homomorphic commit-
ment. The scheme also first splits a value (specifically, the modulo)
into random shares among the users. An individual user reading is
committed with the exponent of the random term (which was the
modulo originally) being the share. Like other schemes, when all
commitments are combined, the random shares cancel each other.
To hide individual usage, all the above schemes aggregate in-
dividual consumption over either a long duration or a group of
users. In short, privacy-preserving data aggregation is a kind of
secure multi-party computation of secret values but is not related
to any subsequent payment according to those values. On the other
hand, our payment problem requires signatures certifying the secret
amounts and aims to achieve seemingly contradictory requirements
(e.g., unlinkability between payments and receipts and preventing
double claim of the same receipt).
B BASIC DEFINITIONS
Definition 1 (Existential Unforgeability). LetSS =(KGen,
Sign, Verify) be a signature scheme. We say that SS is (t, q, ϵ)-
EUF-CMA-secure if for all PPT adversaries A running in time t:
≤ ϵ
(cid:20) Verify(vk,(m∗, σ∗)) = 1 ∧ m∗ (cid:60) Q :
(vk, sk) ← KGen(1λ);(m∗, σ∗) ← ASign(sk,·)(vk)
(cid:21)
Pr
where Q = {m1, . . . , mq} denotes the set of queries to the signing
oracle. Whenever q = poly(λ) and ϵ(λ) = negl(λ), we simply say that
SS is EUF-CMA-secure.
A group sampler is a PPT algorithmIG that on input the security
parameter λ outputs a tuple (G, д, q) ← IG(1λ). It defines a poly(λ)-
bit representation for group elements in G of order q. For the sake
of simplicity, we omit the indication of IG hereafter, but we note
that in the following definitions, the probabilities are also taken
over the randomness of IG.
Definition 2 (Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem).
Given (д, дx , дy), compute дxy, where {д, дx , дy} ∈ G and (x, y) ←
Z2
q. Let the advantage of a PPT algorithm A in solving the computa-
tional Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem be:
AdvCDH
A
= Pr[(x, y) ← Z2
q : A(д, дx , дy) = дxy].
The CDH assumption requires that, for any PPT adversary A, the
advantage of solving the CDH problem AdvCDH
A is negligible.
Gap Diffie-Hellman (Gap-DH) groups (e.g., [12, 19]) are those
where the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem can be solved
in polynomial time, but no PPT algorithm can solve the CDH
problem with non-negligible probability, e.g., bilinear groups. Let
ODDH(·) denote an oracle machine that takes input (д, дx , дy , дz) ∈
G4, outputs 1 if z = xy and outputs 0 otherwise.
Definition 3 (Gap-Diffie-Hellman (Gap-DH) Problem). Given
(д, дx , дy) and access to a DDH oracle (ODDH(·)), compute дxy, where
{д, дx , дy} ∈ G and (x, y) ← Z2
q. Let the advantage of a PPT algo-
rithm A in solving the gap-DH problem AdvGap-DH
be:
q : AODDH(·)(д, дx , дy) = дxy].
A
Pr[(x, y) ← Z2
The gap-DH assumption requires that, for any PPT adversary A, the
advantage of solving the gap-DH problem AdvGap-DH
is negligible.
We assume that the gap-DH assumption holds in bilinear group
A
G1. The use of pairing groups enables such a DDH oracle.
C FORMAL SECURITY ANALYSIS
C.1 Privacy
First, we claim that Sipster satisfies privacy, namely the UC can-
not infer how many e-coins it receives from an RU, nor link any
spending of e-coin to a particular RU.
To define privacy, we introduce a user indistinguishability game
between an adversary A, acting as the malicious UC, and a chal-
lenger C, acting as both the RU and SMs. This definition guarantees
that a curious UC cannot differentiate users who made payments in
Sipster, even when UC can choose these target users and adaptively
induce them to perform payment-related operations of its choice.
Definition 4 (User Indistinguishability). The user indis-
tinguishability game between an adversary A and a challenger C
proceeds in steps as follows:
• Setup Phase: C runs the key generation algorithm of a digi-
tal signature scheme to obtain a verification/signing key pair
(vkSM, skSM), and gives the verification key vkSM to A. C
plays the role of the RU and N smart meter instances {SMi}i∈[N]
that share the same signing key skSM. The internal states
{τi}i∈[N] are initialized. C also initializes empty sets ID
(for recording corrupted IDs) and {RCi}i∈[N] (for storing re-
ceipts). C chooses a random permutation π : [N] → [N]. A
chooses a billing period t. It runs the setup algorithm for the
