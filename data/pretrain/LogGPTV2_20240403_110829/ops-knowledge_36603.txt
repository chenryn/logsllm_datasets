User: Python fails to quit when using Ctrl-C in Powershell/Command Prompt, and instead gives out a "KeyboardInterrupt" string. 
Recently I've reinstalled Windows 10. Before the reinstall Ctrl-C quit python (3.5/2.7) fine, with no output. 
Does anyone know why this has started happening? Whether it's just a simple setting?
The only difference I can think of is I'm now on python 3.6. Ctrl-D works in Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, and Ctrl-C works fine in an activated anaconda python2 environment for quitting python.
Assistant: In my case, I found out that right ctrl + c does the trick in anaconda3 powershell - so no remapping necessary - I'm on Windows 10.
