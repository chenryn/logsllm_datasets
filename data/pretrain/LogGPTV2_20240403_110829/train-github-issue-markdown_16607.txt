 **Describe the bug**
i have orbitcontroller.update() in the animate loop for damping  
and  
after doing orbitcontroller.enabled=false , i still cant tilt the camera,
my guess is , the update logic to prevent the camera from tilting /going
upside down is still running  
**Expected behavior**  
maybe in the update function when orbitcontroller.enabled=false , return early
?
