User: How to monitor application performance and status with Prometheus?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use Prometheus to monitor the performance and status of the application: 1. Install and configure Prometheus: Download the Prometheus binary file, unzip it and configure the crawl target (the address of the application) in the prometheus.yml file. 2. Add the Prometheus client library to the application: Integrate the Prometheus client library into the application and use the metrics it provides to monitor the application. 3. Provide indicators: Use the Prometheus client library to provide indicators. Custom metrics can be created based on the needs of the application, such as request latency, error types, database connections, etc. 4. Configure Prometheus rules: Configure Prometheus rules based on metrics, such as triggering an alert if the error rate reaches a certain threshold. 5. Start Prometheus: Start Prometheus and access its web interface, which will display the collected metrics. 6. Adding an alert: Use the Prometheus interface to add an alert rule that will trigger a notification when an alert is triggered, such as sending an email or SMS. 7. Analyze and visualize indicators: Use the query language (PromQL) and visualization tools (such as Grafana) provided by Prometheus to analyze and visualize indicators. With the steps above, you can start monitoring the performance and status of your application, and alerting and analyzing if necessary.
