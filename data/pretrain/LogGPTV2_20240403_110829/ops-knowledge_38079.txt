User: Since the signal module is not supported in the python version of Google App Engine, what is the simplest way to call a method and throw/catch an exception if the method does not return in less than 2 seconds?
Assistant: In loops, you can store the time the loop started and check how long it's been going on each iteration.
If you're not in a loop, things are a bit trickier. You could add the time-checking bit every few lines of code.  This, of course, makes for really ugly code, but without the ability to spawn threads that could run a timer in the background and interrupt the running code, there's not much of a way around it.
