### Title: Re-Certifying Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)

Microsoft's Active Directory Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implementation, known as Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), has often been overlooked by the cybersecurity community. AD CS is widely deployed and provides attackers with opportunities for credential theft, machine persistence, domain escalation, and subtle domain persistence. In this document, we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of certificates in Active Directory, outline potential attack vectors, and offer preventive, detective, and incident response guidance to help organizations secure their AD CS environments.

By presenting the most comprehensive guidance on securing AD CS, we aim to equip organizations with the information and tools they need to protect these complex, widely deployed, and often misunderstood systems.
