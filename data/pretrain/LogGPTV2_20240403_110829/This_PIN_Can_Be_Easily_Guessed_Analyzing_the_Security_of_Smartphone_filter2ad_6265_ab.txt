will also discuss any limitations of the study as well as ethical
considerations. Please refer to Appendix A for the speciﬁc
wording and layouts of the questions.
A. Study Protocol and Design
We conducted a user study of 4- and 6-digit PINs using
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) with n = 1220 participants
over a period of three weeks. To mimic the PIN creation
process in our browser-based study, participants were restricted
to mobile devices by checking the user-agent string.
We applied a 9-treatment, between-subjects study protocol
for the PIN selection criteria, e.g., 4- vs. 6-digit with or without
blacklisting. The speciﬁcs of the treatments are discussed in
detail in Section IV-B. At the end of the study, we collected
851 and 369 PINs, 4- and 6-digits respectively, for a total
of 1220 PINs as our core dataset. These PINs were all
selected, conﬁrmed, and recalled. We additionally recorded
all intermediate PIN selections, such as what would happen if
a selected PIN was not blacklisted and the participant did not
have to select a different PIN. For more details of different
kinds of PINs collected and analyzed, refer to Table VI.
All participants were exposed to a set of questions and
feedback prompts that gauged the security, memorability, and
usability of their selected PINs, as well as their attitudes
towards blacklisting events during PIN selection.
The survey itself consists of 10 parts. Within each part, to
avoid ordering effects, we applied randomization to the order
of the questions that may inform later ones; this information
is also available in Appendix A. The parts of the survey are:
1) Informed Consent: All participants were informed of the
procedures of the survey and had to provide consent. The
informed consent notiﬁed participants that they would be
required to select PINs in different treatments, but did not
inform them of any details about blacklisting that might
be involved in that selection.
2) Agenda: After being informed, participants were provided
additional
instructions and details in the form of an
agenda. It stated the following: “You will be asked to

complete a short survey that requires you to select a
numeric PIN and then answer some questions about it
afterwards. You contribute to research so please answer
correctly and as detailed as possible.”
3) Practice: Next, participants practiced with the PIN entry
screen, which mimics typical PIN selection on mobile de-
vices, including the “phoneword” alphabet on the virtual
PIN pad. The purpose of the practice round was to ensure
that participants were familiar with the interface prior to
selecting a PIN. There was clear indication during the
practice round that this was practice and that participants
would begin the primary survey afterwards.
4) Priming: After familiarization and before selection, par-
ticipants were further primed about mobile unlock au-
thentication and PINs using language similar to what iOS
and Android use during PIN selection. A visual of the
priming is in Figure 2. A lock icon was used to prime
notions of security, and users were reminded that they
will need to remember their PIN for the duration of the
study without writing it down. Participants must click “I
understand” to continue. The qualitative feedback shows
that the priming was understood and followed with some
participants even stating that they reused their actual PIN.
5) Creation: The participants then performed the PIN cre-
ation on the page shown in Figure 3. The PIN was entered
by touching the digits on the virtual PIN pad. As usual,
users had to enter the PIN a second time to conﬁrm it
was entered correctly. Depending on the treatment (see
Section IV-B), the users either selected a 4- or 6-digit PIN
and did or did not experience a blacklist event. In Figure 4
and Figure 5 we depicted the two blacklist warnings
which either allowed participants to “click through” the
warning (or not). The feedback was copied to directly
mimic the wording and layout of a blacklist warning used
by Apple since iOS 12.
6) Blacklisting Followup: After creation, we asked partici-
pants about their attitudes and strategies with blacklisting.
If the participants experienced a blacklist event, we
referred back to that event in asking followup questions.
Otherwise, we asked participants to “imagine” such an
experience. These questions form the heart of our quali-
tative analysis (see Section VI-F).
7) PIN Selection Followup: We asked a series of questions
to gauge participants’ attitudes towards the PIN they
selected with respect to its security and usability, where
usability was appraised based on ease of entry and mem-
orability (see Section VI-E). As part of this questionnaire,
we also asked an attention check question. We excluded
the data of 12 participants because we could not guarantee
that they followed our instructions completely.
8) Recall: On this page, participants were asked to recall
their earlier selected PIN. Although the two prior parts
formed distractor tasks we do not expect that the recall
rates measured here speak broadly for the memorability
of these PINs. As expected, nearly all participants could
recall their selected PIN.
9) Demographics: In line with best practice [32], we col-
lected the demographics of the participants at the very
end,
including age, gender, IT background, and their
current mobile unlock authentication.
10) Honesty/Submission: Finally, we asked if the participants
provided “honest” answers to the best of their ability. We
informed them that they would be paid even if they indi-
cated dishonesty. Using this information in combination
with the attention check described above, we excluded
the data of 12 participants to ensure the integrity of our
data. After afﬁrming honesty (or dishonesty), the survey
concluded and was submitted.
B. Treatments
We used 9 different treatments: 6 treatments for 4-digit
PINs and 3 treatments for 6-digit PINs. The naming and
description of each treatment can be found in Table III, as
well as the number of participants (non-overlapping, between-
subjects) exposed to each treatment.
1) Control Treatments: For each PIN length, we had a
control treatment, Control-4-digit and Control-6-digit, that
simply primed participants for mobile unlock authentication
and asked them to select a PIN without any blacklist in-
teraction. These PINs form the basis of our 4- and 6-digit
mobile-authentication primed PIN dataset. In total, we have
231 control 4-digit PINs and 127 control 6-digit PINs. We
decided to have a larger sample of 4-digit PINs to better
validate our methodology compared to other datasets.
We sometimes refer to two datasets, First-Choice-4-digit
and First-Choice-6-digit. These combine the control PINs
with those chosen by participants from other treatments in their
“ﬁrst attempt” before having been subjected to any blacklist.
The First-Choice-4-digit dataset contains 851 4-digit PINs
while First-Choice-6-digit consists of 369 6-digit PINs.
2) Blacklist Treatments: The remaining treatments consid-
ered PIN selection in the presence of a blacklist. There are
two types of blacklist implementations: enforcing and non-
enforcing. An enforcing blacklist does not allow to continue
as long as the selected PIN is blacklisted; the user must select
a non-blacklisted PIN. A non-enforcing blacklist warns the
user that the selection is blacklisted, but the user can choose
to ignore the feedback and proceed anyway. We describe
this treatment as providing the participant an option to click
through. Otherwise, the treatment uses an enforcing blacklist.
Visuals of the non-enforcing and enforcing feedback can be
found in Figure 4 and 5, respectively.
a) Placebo Blacklist: As we wanted to determine if the
experience of hitting a blacklist or the content of the blacklist
itself drive the results, we included a placebo treatment for
both 4- and 6-digit PINs (Placebo-4-digit and Placebo-6-
digit, respectively). In this treatment, the user’s ﬁrst choice
PIN was blacklisted, forcing a second choice. As long as the
second choice differed from the ﬁrst, it was accepted.
b) iOS Blacklist: For this treatment, we included the
blacklists used on Apple’s iOS 12. The 4-digit iOS blacklist
contains 274 PINs (2.74 % of the available 4-digit PINs), and

the 6-digit iOS blacklist contains 2910 PINs (0.291 % of the
available 6-digit PINs). These blacklists provide measurements
of real scenarios for users selecting PINs on iOS devices.
As iOS allows users to “click through” the blacklist warning
and use their blacklisted PIN anyway, we implemented our
blacklisting for the iOS condition in the same way (i.e., con-
ditions iOS-4-digit-wCt and iOS-6-digit-wCt). To understand
the effect of non-enforcing blacklists, we also had an enforcing
version of the iOS blacklist for 4-digits (iOS-4-digit-nCt).
c) Data-Driven Blacklists: We considered two 4-digit
blacklists that are signiﬁcantly (10x) smaller (27 PINs) and
(10x) larger (2740 PINs) than the iOS blacklist. The blacklists
were constructed using the 27 and 2740 most frequently
occurring PINs in the Amitay-4-digit dataset, and we refer
to them as DD-4-digit-27 and DD-4-digit-2740. When com-
paring these two data-driven blacklists and the one used in
iOS, it can be seen that they have different compositions.
While 22, i.e., 82 % of the PINs contained in DD-4-digit-
27 are blacklisted in iOS, there are also 5 PINs which are
not. Surprisingly, these PINs correspond to simple patterns
like 0852 which is a bottom-up pattern across the PIN pad
or 1379, the four corners of the pad chosen in a left-to-right
manner. Similar observations can be made when comparing the
iOS and the large DD-4-2740 blacklist. Of 274 PINs which are
rejected by iOS, 258, i.e., 92 %, are also blocked by our large
data-driven blacklist. The remaining 16 PINs all follow the
same repetitive aabb scheme, e.g., 0033, 4433, or 9955.
Interestingly, only one of those PINs, 9933, was selected in
our study which shows that double repetitions are presumably
not as common as Apple expects.
C. Recruitment and Demographics
Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we recruited a
total of 1452 participants. After excluding a portion due to
invalid responses to attention tests or survey errors, we had
1220 participants remaining. We required our participants to
be 18 years or older, reside in the US (as checked by MTurk),

and have at least an 85 % approval rate on MTurk. The IRB
approval required focusing on participants residing in the US,
but there may be a secondary beneﬁt to this: US residents
often do not have chip-and-PIN credit cards (although, they
do use 4-digit ATM PINs), in contrast to residents in Europe or
Asia, and thus may associate PIN selection more strongly with
mobile device locking. In any case, participants were explicitly
primed for the mobile device unlock setting. Participants
indicated they understood this instruction, and their qualitative
responses conﬁrm that this was indeed the case.
We also reviewed all of the participants’ responses for
consistency, including answers to attention check questions,
the honesty question, and speed of entry. We removed 12 who
provided inconsistent data but did not “reject” any participants
on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants were compensated
with $ 1 (USD) for completion; the survey took on average
5 minutes for an hourly rate of $ 12.
a) Demographics and Background: As
typical on
MTurk, our sample is relatively young and better educated than
the general US population. Of the participants, 619 identiﬁed
as male (51%) while 590 (48%) identiﬁed as female (1 %
identiﬁed as other or preferred not to say), and the plurality
of our participants were between 25 and 34 years old (47 %).
Most participants had some college (23 %) or a bachelor’s

degree. While 26 % described having a technical background,
71 % described not having one. We have the full details of the
demographics responses in Appendix B in Table IX.
b) Smartphone OS: We asked participants which oper-
ating system they use on their primary smartphone. Slightly
more than half, 698 (57 %), of the participants were Android
users, while 506 (42 %) were iOS users. We collected browser
user-agent strings during the survey, and conﬁrmed similar
breakdowns, suggesting most participants used their primary
smartphone to take the survey. A detailed breakdown can be
found in the Appendix C in Table X.
c) Unlock Schemes Usage: As we focus on mobile
authentication, we were interested in learning about the kind
of mobile authentication our participants use, recalling both
biometric and knowledge-based authentication may be in use
on a single device. We ﬁrst asked if a biometric was used and
then asked what authentication participants use instead or as
a backup for the biometric, e.g., when it fails. While Table IV
shows a compressed description, a detailed breakdown can be
found in the Appendix C in Table X. For knowledge-based
authenticators, considered here, PINs are the most common:
44 % described using a 4-digit PIN, 20 % using a 6-digit PIN,
and 3 % using a PIN longer than 6 digits. The second most
common form of knowledge-based authentication are Android
unlock patterns at 14 %, and 44 participants (or 4 %) reported
using an alphanumeric password. In our study, 140 participants
reported not using any locking method.
D. Ethical Considerations
All of the survey material and protocol was approved by
our Institutional Review Board (IRB). Beyond meeting the
approval of our institution, we worked to uphold the ethical
principles outlined in the Menlo Report [43].
In practicing respect for persons and justice, beyond in-
forming and getting consent, we also sought to compensate
participants fairly at least at the minimum wage of the munic-
ipality where the oversight was performed. Since some of our
treatments may frustrate participants, e.g., where the blacklist
was quite large (DD-4-digit-2740), we also compensated those
who returned the survey and notiﬁed us of their frustration.
Additionally, as we are dealing with authentication informa-
tion, we evaluated the ethics of collecting PINs and distributing
blacklists in terms of beneﬁcence. With respect to collecting
PINs, there is risk in that participants may (and likely will)
expose PINs used in actual authentication. However, there is
limited to no risk in that exposure due to the fact that PINs
are not linked to participants and thus cannot be used in a
targeted attack. A targeted attack would need proximity and
awareness of the victim, of which, neither is the case for this
study. Meanwhile, the beneﬁt of the research is high in that
the goal of this research is to improve the security of mobile
authentication. Similarly, distributing blacklists increases so-
cial good and scientiﬁc understanding with minimal risk as a
determined attacker likely already has access to this material.
Finally, we have described our procedures transparently and
make our methods available when considering respect for law
and public interest. We also do not access any information
that is not already publicly available.
E. Limitations
There are a number of limitations in this study. Foremost
among them is the fact that the participant sample is skewed
towards mostly younger users residing in the US. However, as
we described previously, there may be some beneﬁt to studying
PINs from US residents as they are less familiar with chip-
and-PIN systems and may be more likely to associate PINs
directly with mobile unlocking. We argue that our sample
provides realizable and generalizable results regarding the
larger ecosystem of PIN selection for mobile authentication.
Further research would be needed to understand how more
age-diverse [31] and location-diverse populations select PINs.
Another limitation of the survey is that we are asking
participants to select PINs while primed for mobile authen-
tication and there is a risk that participants do not act the
same way in the wild. We note that similar priming is used in
the authentication literature for both text-based passwords for
desktop [41], [40] and mobile settings [28], and these results
generalize when compared to passwords from leaked password
datasets [42]. We have similar results here. When compared
to the most realistic dataset previously available, Amitay-4-
digit, the most common 4-digit PINs collected in our study
are also present in similar distributions to Amitay [2]. Also, in
analyzing the qualitative data, a number of participants noted
that they used their real unlock PINs.
While this presents strong evidence of the effectiveness
of mobile unlock priming, we, unfortunately, do not have
any true comparison points, like what is available for text-
based passwords. There is no obvious analog to the kinds of
attacks that have exposed millions of text-based passwords
that would similarly leak millions of mobile unlock PINs.
Given the available evidence, we argue that collecting PINs
primed for mobile unlock authentication provides a reasonable
