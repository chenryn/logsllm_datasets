### Study Protocol and Design

We conducted a user study to evaluate 4- and 6-digit PINs using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) with 1,220 participants over a three-week period. To simulate the PIN creation process, participants were restricted to mobile devices by verifying the user-agent string.

The study employed a 9-treatment, between-subjects design for different PIN selection criteria, such as 4- vs. 6-digit PINs with or without blacklisting. The specific details of these treatments are elaborated in Section IV-B. At the end of the study, we collected 851 4-digit PINs and 369 6-digit PINs, totaling 1,220 PINs. These PINs were selected, confirmed, and recalled. We also recorded all intermediate PIN selections, including those that would have been chosen if a selected PIN was not blacklisted and the participant did not need to select a different PIN. For more information on the types of PINs collected and analyzed, refer to Table VI.

Participants were asked a series of questions and provided feedback prompts to assess the security, memorability, and usability of their selected PINs, as well as their attitudes towards blacklisting events during PIN selection.

The survey consisted of 10 parts, with randomization applied to the order of questions within each part to avoid ordering effects. The survey structure is as follows:

1. **Informed Consent**: Participants were informed about the survey procedures and required to provide consent. The informed consent stated that they would be asked to select PINs under different conditions but did not disclose any details about potential blacklisting.

2. **Agenda**: After providing consent, participants received additional instructions and an agenda, which stated: "You will complete a short survey that requires you to select a numeric PIN and then answer some questions about it. Your participation contributes to research, so please answer accurately and in detail."

3. **Practice**: Participants practiced with the PIN entry screen, which mimicked typical PIN selection on mobile devices, including the "phoneword" alphabet on the virtual PIN pad. This practice round ensured familiarity with the interface before selecting a PIN.

4. **Priming**: Participants were primed about mobile unlock authentication and PINs using language similar to iOS and Android. A visual lock icon was used to emphasize security, and participants were reminded to remember their PIN without writing it down. They had to click "I understand" to proceed.

5. **Creation**: Participants created their PIN on the page shown in Figure 3, entering it twice to confirm. Depending on the treatment, participants either selected a 4- or 6-digit PIN and may or may not have experienced a blacklist event. Blacklist warnings, as depicted in Figures 4 and 5, were designed to mimic the wording and layout used by Apple since iOS 12.

6. **Blacklisting Follow-up**: Participants were asked about their attitudes and strategies regarding blacklisting. If they experienced a blacklist event, follow-up questions referred back to that event. Otherwise, they were asked to imagine such an experience.

7. **PIN Selection Follow-up**: Questions gauged participants' attitudes towards the security and usability of their selected PINs, focusing on ease of entry and memorability. An attention check question was included, and data from 12 participants who failed this check were excluded.

8. **Recall**: Participants were asked to recall their selected PIN. Although the previous parts served as distractor tasks, the recall rates measured here do not broadly reflect the memorability of the PINs. As expected, nearly all participants could recall their PIN.

9. **Demographics**: Participants' demographics, including age, gender, IT background, and current mobile unlock authentication, were collected at the end of the survey.

10. **Honesty/Submission**: Participants were asked if they provided honest answers to the best of their ability. They were informed that they would be compensated regardless of their response. Using this information and the attention check, data from 12 participants were excluded to ensure data integrity. After confirming honesty, the survey concluded and was submitted.

### Treatments

We used nine different treatments: six for 4-digit PINs and three for 6-digit PINs. The naming, description, and number of participants exposed to each treatment are detailed in Table III.

1. **Control Treatments**: For each PIN length, a control treatment (Control-4-digit and Control-6-digit) primed participants for mobile unlock authentication and asked them to select a PIN without any blacklist interaction. These PINs form the basis of our 4- and 6-digit mobile-authentication primed PIN dataset. We have 231 control 4-digit PINs and 127 control 6-digit PINs. The First-Choice-4-digit dataset contains 851 4-digit PINs, and the First-Choice-6-digit dataset consists of 369 6-digit PINs.

2. **Blacklist Treatments**: The remaining treatments involved PIN selection with a blacklist. There are two types of blacklist implementations: enforcing and non-enforcing. An enforcing blacklist does not allow continuation until a non-blacklisted PIN is selected, while a non-enforcing blacklist warns the user but allows them to proceed. Visuals of the non-enforcing and enforcing feedback can be found in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

   - **Placebo Blacklist**: This treatment, for both 4- and 6-digit PINs, blacklisted the user's first choice, forcing a second choice. The second choice was accepted as long as it differed from the first.
   
   - **iOS Blacklist**: This treatment used the blacklists from Apple's iOS 12. The 4-digit iOS blacklist contains 274 PINs (2.74% of available 4-digit PINs), and the 6-digit iOS blacklist contains 2,910 PINs (0.291% of available 6-digit PINs). We implemented the iOS condition with and without the ability to "click through" the blacklist warning.
   
   - **Data-Driven Blacklists**: Two 4-digit blacklists, significantly smaller (27 PINs) and larger (2,740 PINs) than the iOS blacklist, were constructed using the most frequently occurring PINs in the Amitay-4-digit dataset. These blacklists, DD-4-digit-27 and DD-4-digit-2740, were compared to the iOS blacklist to observe differences in composition.

### Recruitment and Demographics

Using MTurk, we recruited 1,452 participants, of whom 1,220 remained after excluding invalid responses to attention tests or survey errors. Participants were required to be 18 years or older, reside in the US, and have at least an 85% approval rate on MTurk. The IRB approval focused on US residents, who often do not use chip-and-PIN credit cards and may associate PINs more strongly with mobile device locking. Participants were explicitly primed for the mobile device unlock setting, and their qualitative responses confirmed this understanding.

Participants' responses were reviewed for consistency, including attention check questions, the honesty question, and speed of entry. Data from 12 participants with inconsistent responses were removed. Participants were compensated $1 (USD) for completion, with the survey taking an average of 5 minutes, resulting in an hourly rate of $12.

**Demographics and Background**: Our sample was relatively young and better educated than the general US population. Of the participants, 619 identified as male (51%), 590 as female (48%), and 1% as other or preferred not to say. Most participants were between 25 and 34 years old (47%). Educational backgrounds included some college (23%), bachelor's degree (39%), and master's or doctoral degree (12%). While 26% described having a technical background, 71% did not. Detailed demographics are provided in Appendix B, Table IX.

**Smartphone OS**: Slightly more than half (57%) of the participants were Android users, and 42% were iOS users. Browser user-agent strings confirmed that most participants used their primary smartphone to take the survey. A detailed breakdown is available in Appendix C, Table X.

**Unlock Schemes Usage**: We asked participants about their mobile authentication methods, including biometric and knowledge-based authentication. PINs were the most common knowledge-based authenticators: 44% used a 4-digit PIN, 20% used a 6-digit PIN, and 3% used a PIN longer than 6 digits. The second most common form was Android unlock patterns (14%), and 4% reported using an alphanumeric password. 140 participants reported not using any locking method. A detailed breakdown is provided in Appendix C, Table X.

### Ethical Considerations

All survey materials and protocols were approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). We upheld ethical principles outlined in the Menlo Report [43], ensuring respect for persons and justice by informing and obtaining consent, and compensating participants fairly. We also compensated participants who returned the survey and expressed frustration, particularly in treatments with large blacklists.

Collecting PINs and distributing blacklists were evaluated for ethical considerations. While there is a risk that participants may expose PINs used in actual authentication, the risk is minimal as PINs are not linked to participants and cannot be used in targeted attacks. The research aims to improve the security of mobile authentication, and distributing blacklists increases social good and scientific understanding with minimal risk. Our procedures are transparent, and we do not access any information that is not already publicly available.

### Limitations

Several limitations exist in this study. The participant sample is skewed towards younger US residents, which may benefit the study as they are less familiar with chip-and-PIN systems and more likely to associate PINs with mobile unlocking. However, further research is needed to understand how more age-diverse and location-diverse populations select PINs.

Additionally, participants were primed for mobile authentication, and there is a risk that their behavior in the study may differ from real-world behavior. Similar priming is used in the authentication literature, and our results generalize when compared to existing datasets. Many participants noted using their real unlock PINs, providing strong evidence of the effectiveness of mobile unlock priming. However, we lack true comparison points, such as those available for text-based passwords. Given the available evidence, we argue that collecting PINs primed for mobile unlock authentication provides a reasonable and generalizable dataset.
