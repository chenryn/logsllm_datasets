User: I want to create a shortcut for IDLE on my mac so that I don't need to go through the terminal. Is there a way to do this? I was trying Automator but I'm not that familiar with it. 
Thanks.
Assistant: You can use a shell script to do what you need on osx.
Instructions to open a python interpreter in terminal:

First create a file called python.command
Open the file in any text editor and copy and paste the following
#!/bin/bash
python
If you want to open the IDLE Standalone App do the following (repeat step 1,2 but paste the following) but make sure your path is correct:
#!/bin/bash
open -a /Applications/Python\ 2.7/IDLE.app
