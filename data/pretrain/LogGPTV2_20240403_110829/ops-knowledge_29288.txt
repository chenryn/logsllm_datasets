I have been using the `python-dns` module and recently attempted to set it up on a new Linux installation. However, I encountered an issue where the module is not being loaded, even after multiple attempts to clean up and reinstall.

### Details

- **Python Version:**
  ```sh
  $ python --version
  Python 2.7.3
  ```

- **pip Version:**
  ```sh
  $ pip --version
  pip 1.0 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
  ```

- **Installation Attempt:**
  ```sh
  $ sudo pip install dnspython
  Downloading/unpacking dnspython
    Downloading dnspython-1.11.1.zip (220Kb): 220Kb downloaded
    Running setup.py egg_info for package dnspython

  Installing collected packages: dnspython
    Running setup.py install for dnspython

  Successfully installed dnspython
  Cleaning up...
  ```

- **Import Error:**
  ```sh
  $ python
  Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import dns
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ImportError: No module named dns
  ```

- **Additional Information:**
  - The firewall is installed on the new machine. I have tried disabling it, but the issue persists.
  - I also tried using `py3dns`, but it did not work either.
  - I was getting an error while using `import dns.resolver`.

### Resolution

After several attempts, I managed to resolve the issue by installing the `pubdns` module instead. This module solved my problem, and I can now proceed with my DNS-related tasks.

Thank you for your assistance.
