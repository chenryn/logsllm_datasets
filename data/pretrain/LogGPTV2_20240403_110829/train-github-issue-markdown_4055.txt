We have a web service architecture where any service (API - Int/Impl) could be
exposed as a web service. Because of this we have very granular deployment
artifacts where each service builds down to a JAR. That way we can pick and
chose what JARs create a web service implementation (into a WAR). Because of
this we have duplicated property file imports and context file imports, but we
know it is going to happen because each individual service needs to be
buildable, runnable, and testable...and then it might be composed into a
larger service.
The example from this thread:  
http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?36482-Preventing-Spring-Context-
to-be-loaded-more-than-once&highlight=duplicate+context+files
Is a perfect example:  
http://piotrga.wordpress.com/2007/03/21/preventing-spring-context-to-be-
loaded-more-than-once/
We might Service B (which is it's own WAR), Service C (which is it's own WAR),
and also a Service A (which has dependencies on Service B/C) and therefore
pulls in duplicate import statements for the same context file.
The following is a post that I made, without a response, describing the same
issue with the property-placeholder.  
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8949174/does-spring-ignore-duplicate-
property-placeholder-files
Since we are aware of the duplicates, we don't want to have exceptions thrown
when encountering duplicate bean ids. We don't receive these errors/issues,
but we can see that the duplicate files are loaded and override each other.
It would be beneficial if both the import and property-placeholder had the
capability to ignore-duplicate-files, or via a property in a custom
ApplicationContext (like we extend XmlWebApplicationContext) which would allow
the ignore-duplicate-files for properties or bean context files.
