Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of assigning and running tasks in stage 26.0. The tasks are identified by their TIDs (1229 and 1230). The system is also computing and storing data in memory (rdd_42_25, rdd_42_27, rdd_42_26, rdd_42_28, and rdd_42_29). The system is also recording the time taken for each task (boot, init, and finish). Task 25.0 in stage 26.0 (TID 1225) has been completed and the result sent to the driver.
