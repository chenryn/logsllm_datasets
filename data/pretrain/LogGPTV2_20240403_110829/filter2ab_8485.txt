**ATT&CK ID:** G1006  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Earth Lusca

Earth Lusca has been observed to add a registry key to load malware as a Print Processor. Specifically, the following registry key is created:

```
HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors\UDPrint
```

The value `Driver` is set to `spool.dll` with the data `spool.dll /f`.

This technique allows the malware to be executed in the context of the print spooler service, providing it with elevated privileges and persistence on the system.
