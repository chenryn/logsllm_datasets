of the classiﬁer for further improvement and adaptability. This
quality of a classiﬁer is also important if our model is to be
incorporated in a browser and be used by users. Therefore,
we opt for the Random Forest algorithm, as it combines the
strength of ensemble learning with the interpretability qualities
of decision trees. Furthermore, decision trees tend to be robust
with regard to outliers, while the ensemble technique of Ran-
dom Forest protects the model against overﬁtting. Moreover,
after the trees have been constructed in the learning phase, the
classiﬁcation is usually very quick in the detection phase.
2) Dataset handling:
a) Train and test dataset: The set of instances used in
the learning phase of the model is referred to as the training
set, for which we reserve 2/3 of our dataset of 6,000 pages.
As follows, 1/3 of the set is isolated and used after the model
is built, in order to adequately evaluate our classiﬁer. Since
these instances are used to test a classiﬁer, they are referred
to as the test set.
b) Data transformation: In order not to overﬁt the clas-
siﬁer, we remove outliers and extreme values from our training
set using an interquartile range ﬁlter, which is conﬁgured to
operate on a per feature basis.
c) Omitted features: Our initial set of features con-
tained two additional features, which, however, were omitted
after manual and algorithmic selection.
One of these features was based on the detection of
WHOIS entries that make use of anonymizing services, such as
WhoisGuard [11]. We expected parked domain owners to have
a higher incentive to anonymize their personal association with
their domains, as opposed to regular domain owners. However,
when manually inspecting the features of the training set, we
found that this feature was not very discriminative for parked
domains. Furthermore, since it required searching for speciﬁc
strings related to anonymizing services, the feature is also less
robust. For these reasons, the feature was removed from our
ﬁnal model.
To further improve our feature selection, a backwards
greedy stepwise search was conducted on the remaining feature
set. The search started with the complete feature set, and
removed features one by one until a better classiﬁcation result
was achieved. The algorithm found that another feature was
reducing the performance of the classiﬁer. This particular fea-
ture counted the number of times the parked domain name was
passed along with HTTP request parameters. The reasoning
behind this feature was that, often, the domain name is sent
as a parameter in a request to a third-party. Parked domains
do this in order to enable the parking service to return content
or ads relevant to the given domain, as described by Wang et
al. [31]. Nevertheless, the feature was found to confuse our
classiﬁer and was thus omitted from the model.
3) Evaluation: After transforming the data and selecting
the best performing features, we built a model from our train-
ing set using Random Forest with 10-fold cross validation. As
a model’s performance is not determined by its effectiveness on
the training set, but on its ability to classify unknown instances,
our test set was used for evaluation purposes. The trained
VI. RELATED WORK
In concurrent work, Alrwais et al. [15] investigated the
domain parking industry, focusing on the fraudulent practices
in their monetization chain. In their work, the authors reg-
istered themselves both as domain owners and advertisers,
effectively operating at both ends of the domain parking
ecosystem. This allowed them to connect the dots and detect
any discrepancies between what they knew to be true and
what the domain parking services claimed as true. Using this
method, the authors uncovered several fraudulent practices
including the presence of click fraud, where their advertising
campaigns were charged for receiving visitors through clicks,
even though the visitors were the researchers’ crawlers which
were conﬁgured to never “click” on any ads.
While Alrwais et al. focus their investigation on the abuse
against advertisers, we instead focus on the abuse against
users landing on parked domains, as well as domain owners
whose trademarks are being diluted because of the absence of
trademark-infringing checks from the domain parking services.
Though our work is orthogonal to their work, we both arrive
at the same conclusion: Domain parking services are currently
unlegislated and that allows for a lot of abuse, towards all
third-parties of the domain parking ecosystem: users landing
on parked pages, advertisers paying for ads, and holders
of popular trademarks and domain names. To that extent,
a client-side countermeasure, like the parked-page classiﬁer
we propose in this paper, can protect the user-part of this
ecosystem while we hopefully transit to a more legislated
domain parking industry.
In 2010, Almishari et al. [14] developed a classiﬁer for
“ads-portal” domains, which they used to identify typosquat-
ting abuse of domain parking services. They observed that in
2008, 50% of parked pages were residing on typosquatting
domains. Now, 6 years later, we witness that parking services
have a signiﬁcantly smaller, albeit still substantial, typosquat-
ting portfolio. The classiﬁer they developed leveraged several
HTML features similar to the ones proposed in this paper. For
instance, they focused on the dominant presence of anchor and
image elements and the numerous parameters passed along
with these URLs. However, they did not incorporate HAR
features, which are able to identify the dynamic and external
nature of parking pages. Furthermore, they did not take into
account redirections and no in-depth frame analysis was made.
In terms of performance, they incorporated keyword-based
features to increase the accuracy of the classiﬁer, a strategy
that we deliberately avoided in order to ensure robustness.
Domain parking was also recently mentioned by Li et
al. who studied generic malicious web infrastructures [23].
Interestingly, the authors observed that domains hosting ma-
licious Trafﬁc Distribution Systems (TDS), were monetized
through parking services after the TDS had been taken down.
Even after a take down, these domains keep on receiving a
large amount of trafﬁc since numerous malicious doorways
(typically compromised websites) are still redirecting users to
the TDS domain.
Prior to the aforementioned research, domain parking was
only mentioned in research regarding cybersquatting. One of
the oldest studies of typosquatting by Wang et al. [31] proposed
a series of typosquatting models and showed that, in 2006,
51% of all the possible typosquatting domains of websites in
the Alexa top 10,000 were registered and active. The authors
uncovered that 59% of the active typosquatting domains were
hosted at 6 major domain parking companies and reported
that inappropriate adult content was encountered on typos of
children’s websites.
In a later study, Moore and Edelman tried to identify the
entities responsible for typosquatting [25]. The researchers
observed that name servers belonging to parking companies
have up to 4 times more typosquatting domains than average.
In terms of advertising, they identiﬁed Google as the prime
source for PPC ads on typosquatted domains. Furthermore,
they encountered abusive domains to be serving ads for the au-
thoritative domain (self-advertising) and for competitors. Ad-
ditionally, they measured a similar concentration phenomenon
as to what we noted in the domain parking ecosystem: 63%
of typosquatting domains that were using Google PPC ads,
belonged to only 5 different publisher IDs. In our study, we
observed that not only Google maintains almost complete
control of advertising in domain parking services, but that they
do so while claiming that domain parking pages are spam [19].
In a very recent content-based typosquatting study, Agten
et al. [12] veriﬁed that parked pages are still
the most
prominent monetization strategy for typosquatting domains.
More speciﬁcally, ad parking was witnessed in 51% of ob-
servations. Furthermore, they detected malicious redirections
towards malware, scams and adult content. Taking into account
the observations from our research,
these
redirections were initiated by parking services that hosted the
typosquatting domains.

VII. CONCLUSION
Despite existing for over ten years, managing millions
of domain names, and making yearly revenues of multiple
millions of dollars, domain parking services have received little
attention so far.
In this paper, we mapped the ecosystem of domain parking
services by identifying popular parking services, the types of
parked domains, the owners of these parked domains, and the
advertising content that users are exposed to when they land
on the pages of parked domains. In this process, we identiﬁed
multiple types of abuse including malware, inappropriate ad-
vertising, and scams that could cost users their personal details
and hundreds of dollars. Next to the abuse affecting users, we
also discovered a signiﬁcant fraction of typosquatting domains
being monetized through domain parking, and witnessed the
lack of controls by successfully parking an obviously abusive
domain with all domain parking services on which we could
get a parking account.
Motivated by the discovered abuse, we designed and built
a parked-page classiﬁer which can be used to, among others,
block parked pages, or alert users that
they are currently
interacting with a parked page. Instead of hardcoding parking
signatures, we compiled a list of generic and robust features
that are characteristic of parked pages and showed that our
classiﬁer has a very high accuracy with only minimal false
positives.
