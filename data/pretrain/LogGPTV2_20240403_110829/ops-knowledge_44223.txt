User: I have a program in C that communicates via UDP with another program (in Java) and then does process manipulation (start/stop) based on the UDP pkt exchange.
Now this C program has been legacy and I want to convert it to Python - do you think Python will be a good choice for the tasks mentioned?
Assistant: Remember as well, you can leave parts of your program in C, turn them into Python modules and build python code around them - you don't need to re-write everything up-front.
