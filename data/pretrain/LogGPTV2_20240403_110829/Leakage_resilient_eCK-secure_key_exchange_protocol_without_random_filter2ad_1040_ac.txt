Security Analysis. In the following, we show that the proposed protocol is an
eCK secure protocol in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.
Theorem 1. Suppose that the (t, q, BDDH)-Bilinear DDH assumption and
(t, q, DLIN)-Decision linear assumption hold in bilinear groups (G, g, GT , p, e), the
hash function H is (t, CR)-secure, and a (t, πPRF)-secure πPRF family with index
{IGT , fGT } where IGT := {(U, V, α)|(U, V, α) ∈ G2 × Zp} and fGT := (U, V, α) →
U r1+αr2V with (r1, r2) ∈R Z2

Proof of Theorem 1. Due to space limitation, we here only provide the sketch
of the proof. We will present the details of the proof in the full paper [19].
EstablishParty(pkm, skm, Pm) with skm = ∅ while registering a public key pkm
for dishonest party Pm. Namely, we allow arbitrary public key registration.
In the security experiment, the adversary is allowed to query
In order to complete the proof of Theorem 1, we must provide the security
proofs for all freshness related cases as Deﬁnition 2:. However, applying the
Propositions 1 and 2 from [11], the security can be reduced to the following two
cases:
3 This can be achieved by performing the computation in steps 2(e) and 2(f) (resp.
steps 3(c) and 3(d)) on a smart card, where the long-term keys are stored. In this
case, the intermediate values would not be exposed due to e.g. malware attacks on
the PC, which we model with StateReveal query.

5 Conclusions
We have presented an eﬃcient eCK-secure key exchange protocols without ran-
dom oracles (and without NAXOS trick), that the security against chosen public
key attacks based on the plain public key assumption (i.e. without KOSK as-
sumption). An open question here is how to construct an eCK secure protocol
without πPRF, we leave out this for future work.
