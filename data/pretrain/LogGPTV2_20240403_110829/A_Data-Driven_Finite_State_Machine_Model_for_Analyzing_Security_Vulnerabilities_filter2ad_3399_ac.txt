### Attack Vector: Sendmail setuid() GOT Entry Manipulation

When the Sendmail program is initiated, the `addr_setuid` (the Global Offset Table entry for the `setuid()` function) is loaded into memory. During the execution of `setuid()`, the value of `addr_setuid` is used as a function pointer to call `setuid()`. According to the predicate depicted by pFSM3, the system should verify whether the value of `addr_setuid` has remained unchanged since it was initially loaded into memory. If the value of `addr_setuid` has been altered (i.e., tampered with), the program should not call the function at the corrupted address. However, the implementation of Sendmail does not perform this check (IMPL_ACPT in pFSM3), and accepts any value of `addr_setuid`. As a result, when `setuid()` is called, the control flow jumps to the malicious code (Mcode) indicated by the tampered `addr_setuid`.

#### Operation 1: Writing Debug Level
- **Action**: Write the debug level `i` to `tTvect[x]`.
- **Steps**:
  - Convert `str_x` and `str_i` to integers `x` and `i`.
  - Check if `x` is within the valid range (0 ≤ x ≤ 100).
  - Set `tTvect[x] = i`.

#### Operation 2: Manipulating the GOT Entry
- **Action**: Modify the GOT entry for the `setuid()` function (i.e., `addr_setuid`).
- **Steps**:
  - Load `addr_setuid` into memory during program initialization.
  - When `setuid()` is called, use the value of `addr_setuid` as the function pointer.
  - The system should check if `addr_setuid` has been changed (pFSM3). If it has, the program should reject the call. However, the current implementation does not perform this check, leading to the execution of malicious code (Mcode).

### FSM Model and Propagation Gates
The FSM model uses propagation gates (triangles between FSMs) to depict the causality of exploiting vulnerabilities in two operations. For example, in Figure 3, operation 1 (writing the debug level) is a precondition for operation 2 (executing Mcode), denoted by the upper propagation gate. The lower propagation gate (Execute MCode) can be a precondition for other operations.

### Example: NULL HTTPD Heap Overflow Vulnerability
Null HTTPD is a multithreaded web server for Linux and Windows platforms. While constructing the FSM model for a known vulnerability, we discovered a new, previously unknown heap overflow vulnerability (Bugtraq ID 6255).

#### Known Vulnerability
- **Function**: `ReadPOSTData`
- **Buffer**: `PostData` (allocated with size `1024 + contentLen`)
- **Issue**: No check for negative `contentLen` values, leading to buffer overflow if `contentLen` is negative (e.g., -800).

#### New Vulnerability
- **Logic Error**: In source code Line 11, the termination condition for `recv` (source code Line 4) is incorrect (`||` should be `&&`).
- **Impact**: A malicious user can supply a correct `contentLen` but an arbitrary length string input to overflow the `PostData` buffer.

#### Further Analysis
- **Heap Layout**: `PostData` is allocated on the heap, followed by a free memory chunk (chunk B).
- **Double-Linked List**: Free chunks are organized as a double-linked list by GNU-libc.
- **Predicate Check**: pFSM3 checks that `B->fd` and `B->bk` are not overwritten to arbitrary values due to the buffer overflow.
- **Implementation Flaw**: The actual implementation does not check `B->fd` and `B->bk` when `PostData` is freed, allowing the attacker to overwrite the GOT entry of `free()` to point to malicious code (Mcode).

### Conclusion
The FSM-based approach not only helps in analyzing known vulnerabilities but also in discovering new ones. By ensuring proper checks and validations, such vulnerabilities can be mitigated, enhancing the security and reliability of software systems.
