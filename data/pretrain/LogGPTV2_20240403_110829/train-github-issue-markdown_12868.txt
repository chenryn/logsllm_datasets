It's common case for continuous deployment to change elasticsearch's client
and index independently. This leads to the case when
`fieldValueFactorFunction` is added to the client but index is not rebuilt
yet. I use `missing` property. Unfortunately FieldValueFactorFunctionParser
demands to have a field in a mapping, it throws exception otherwise. This
means we can't deploy an client before index is updated despite having
`missing` property set. The suggestion here is to look as `missing` in case of
field in the document or mapping are missing.
