## Abstract:
Mobile applications often include privacy settings that allow users to control how their data is shared. However, these settings are frequently difficult to locate and understand, even in popular apps like Facebook. More concerning, they are often set by default to share user data, thereby exposing personal information without proper consent. This paper presents the first systematic study on this issue, conducted through an in-depth analysis of user perceptions of privacy settings.

We conducted two user studies involving nearly one thousand participants to understand privacy settings from the user's perspective and identify hard-to-find settings. We then selected 14 unique features that characterize hidden privacy settings and developed a novel technique called semantics-based UI tracing to extract these features from mobile apps. Using these features, we trained a classifier to automatically detect hidden privacy settings, which was implemented into a tool called Hound. Hound achieved an accuracy of 93.54% on our labeled dataset.

When applied to 100,000 latest apps from Google Play and third-party markets, Hound found that over a third (36.29%) of the identified privacy settings were "hidden." Our analysis revealed that these settings are difficult to discover and understand primarily due to problematic categorization on the app's user interfaces and confusing descriptions. Additionally, while more privacy options have been offered over time, the usability issues persist and have become more severe, with originally easy-to-find settings now harder to locate. Among all hidden privacy settings, 82.16% are set to leak user data by default. We provide suggestions for improving the usability of these privacy settings at the end of our study.

## I. Introduction
Many mobile applications (apps) utilize user information to provide better services. To obtain user consent, they often include various privacy settings, such as those for sharing location information or enabling friends to find the user via their phone number. Although these settings offer users control over their privacy, there are frequent complaints about the difficulty in locating them within the app's user interface (UI). This can be a serious privacy concern, especially when the settings are configured by default to expose user data.

For example, in October 2016, Facebook was awarded the "Big Brother" award [1] as the "biggest privacy-offender of the year." Critics pointed out that many of its privacy settings are opt-in by default for collecting sensitive data (e.g., location, friend list) and are deeply hidden within the UI. For instance, the "Nearby Friends" setting, which allowed the app to share the user's location with friends by default, was placed under "Location" in "Account Settings," which is not a typical place for privacy settings. This problem is pervasive, affecting prominent apps like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Spotify.

In this paper, we report the first large-scale measurement study on hidden privacy settings, providing insights into their prevalence, privacy implications, and the fundamental causes of their problematic designs. We conducted two user studies to identify the unique features of hard-to-locate configurations and developed an automatic analysis tool called Hound to detect these hidden settings.

## II. Understanding Hidden Privacy Settings
To understand privacy settings from the user's perspective, we designed two user studies. The first study aimed to gauge users' perceptions of data exposure controlled by privacy settings. The second study determined whether these settings are presented in an easy-to-find manner. From the feedback, we identified the root causes of why these settings are difficult to find, which helped us develop methods to detect them in apps.

### A. Privacy Settings in Mobile Apps
Privacy settings are essential for obtaining user consent for data collection and enabling users to balance protection and usability. For example, LinkedIn allows users to disable targeted advertising through "Advertising preferences (Choose whether LinkedIn can use cookies to personalize ads)."

To understand the privacy settings and the data they protect, we manually analyzed 200 popular apps (top 100 apps in English from Google Play and top 100 apps in Chinese from Baidu Market). These apps fall into 37 different categories, and we extracted all settings under the "Privacy Settings" UI. We collected around 600 settings and classified them into six categories based on the data they protect: on-device data, personal profile, social connections, behaviors, posted content, and anti-spam settings. Only on-device data can be secured by system permissions; for other categories, users must rely on the settings to control data leakage.

**User Study 1: User Perspective of Privacy Settings**
To understand whether users care about the private data protected by these settings, we conducted an online survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The survey asked participants to rate their level of concern if the data protected by specific settings were leaked. For example, "Facebook accesses your location even when you are NOT using the app. What do you feel about if this case happens?"

The survey involved 269 participants, and 265 had used Facebook for over a month. The median age was 29, with 44.15% male and 55.85% female. 60.38% held a Bachelor's or higher degree. After removing 65 careless responses, we found that 83.5% of participants cared about (i.e., felt "Very upset" or "Upset") the data covered by at least one privacy setting, and 61.5% cared about the data protected under more than half of the settings. Additionally, 71.0% of participants thought that the data protected by privacy settings were as important as or more important than those covered by system permissions.

### B. Hidden Privacy Settings
To understand why some privacy settings are difficult to find, we conducted a second user study involving 732 participants over 100 days. The results showed that nearly half (47.12%) of the settings were considered hidden, and about one-tenth (9.64%) were never successfully found by any participants. From the participants' feedback, we identified six root causes of the difficulty in finding these settings.
