Thank you for the amazing work.
I am using Tensorboard to visualize my training, and it works just fine.
But when I need to change the frequency of loss scalers, I can't find api to
do this. I want to more scalers log, maybe log end of every batch. Now I can
only get one log during an epoch. Thanks a lot.
    tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir = log_dir,
        histogram_freq = 1,
        write_graph = True,
        write_images = False,
        embeddings_freq = embeddings_freq,
        embeddings_layer_names = None,
        embeddings_metadata = "w2v_metadata.tsv")
