User: py2exe is great, and I use it whenever I want to package up a python program to run on a Windows system.
My question is, is there an equivalent tool that I can use to package up the program on Windows, but that I can then run on Linux?
Assistant: I really doubt that you can do something like that at all. 
What you could do is just configure yourself 3 build VMs one for Windows, one for MacOS and one for Linux that have everyhing you need to run your program.
Then use either a combination of py2exe/py2app/pyinstaller to generate a distribution for each of the platforms. You will have 3 different pacakges but each one of them will be nicely packed and with no need to install anything else on the client machines.
