impossible to transmit any package correctly. However, due
to frequency hopping, the link probably recovers in the next
slot. Hence, this type of failure can be seen as transient. Figure
17 shows how a link recovers from transient errors for two
different failure rates. Recall that the recovery probability is
w.l.o.g. always assumed to be 0.9. In both cases, the link
returns to its steady-state almost immediately.
The quick recovery implies that transient errors usually have
little effect on the network performance, since they only effect
a transmission if they happen to occur during that transmission.
In that case the message is retransmitted in the next cycle.
Hence, WirelessHART is assumed to be stable and robust
against transient errors.
Unlike frequency interferences, temporary physical obstruc-
tion (losing Line of Sight) may cause link failures for a random
period of time, since frequency hopping does not help in this
case. One possibility of modeling such failures is to assume
that the number of cycles which are affected by the failure is
geometrically distributed.
Consider the example network, as shown in Figure 12,
where different links carry different workloads. Link e3 (con-
necting n3 and the Gateway) for example is shared by four
paths (3, 7, 8, and 10). If it suffers a failure, all four paths
will be affected. When we assume that the failure lasts one
cycle (400 milliseconds), Table III compares the reachability
probabilities with a failure that lasts one cycle with those of
links in steady-state for the affected paths. From the table,
it can be seen that the reachability of longer paths drops
more than the reachability of shorter paths. Moreover, the
reachability of paths that do not pass by the affected link does
not change (and is hence not included in the table). If the
random failure lasts even longer (i.e. 2 or 3 cycles), it will
deﬁnitely degrade the performance severely. Hence, random
link failures may impair the system’s robustness and control
loop stability.
When the link failure duration is long compared to the
control loop or reporting interval, it is regarded as permanent.
Under such circumstances, it can not be solved by the current
routing graph. However, the failed link needs to be removed
from the routing graph, and the messages should be routed via
other intermediate nodes to establish new paths to the gateway.
Another alternative countermeasure may be to identify the

physically).
D. Fast control
In the previous evaluation, the reporting interval Is = 4 was
used for all paths. From the delay distribution in Figure 14,
one can identify the longest delay to be 1400ms, which may
be not acceptable in some control scenarios. In this section,
alternative Is values will be discussed to speed up the control
response.
To make it more concrete, take a one hop path as example.
Considering the unique link with π(up) = 0.903, Figure 18
shows the reachability probabilities of all received messages
that are represented by blocks. Observing four consecutive
cycles, when the reporting interval is one, every cycle produces
a message that reaches the gateway with probability 0.903.
When the reporting interval becomes 2, two messages that
are generated at the ﬁrst and third cycle separately, reach
the gateway with probability 0.99 during the same reporting
interval. Finally, when the reporting interval is four, only the
message that is generated in the ﬁrst cycle reaches the gateway
with probability 0.999.
Consider a fast control scenario with Is = 2, which means
that a control loop lasts only two cycles and the reporting
frequency is doubled, compared to the regular control as
discussed above. Figure 19 compares the reachability prob-
abilities for all ten paths with two different reporting intervals
for different link availabilities.

Messages reach situation with different reporting intervals
It can be seen that the reachability probabilities with fast
control (in red) are lower than those with regular control, and
the difference between them also increases with decreasing
link availabilities. Moreover, we can observe that the impact
of fast control is higher for paths with a higher hop-count, like
the 3-hop path number 10.
In conclusion we can state that if the reporting interval
becomes longer, less messages are received by the controller,
but each of them has a higher probability to actually reach
the gateway. Note that, while a shorter reporting interval can
speed up the control loop and provide fresher data for real-
time monitoring, it also introduces more communication and
power overhead, as well. Therefore, it is important to achieve
a good balance by selecting an appropriate Is according to
real application requirements.
E. Performance Prediction
In this section, we consider a scenario where a new node
joins the network and show how to take routing decisions
through performance prediction.
In the WirelessHART network, as shown in Figure 20, node
3 connects to the gateway along path 1, which has m hops;
node 4 connects to the gateway along path 2, which has n
hops. When a new node 5 joins the network topology, it has
to establish a route through the mesh network to the gateway.
This can be done by connecting to an existing path within its
communication range, e.g. path 1 or path 2.
Since the performance of the existing paths can be ei-
ther measured in the real system or analyzed as proposed
in Section V, we are able to predict
the performance of
the composition path using Equation (12). However, before
the peer path (e.g. path 3) has been established, the cycle
probabilities of the peer path gp(x) are unknown and need to
be established in the following way:
The performance of a 1-hop path is determined by the
transition probabilities of its link model. Since the recovery
transition probability prc is assumed to be a ﬁxed value, the
performance solely depends on the failure probability. Using
Equation (2) and Equation (1), the probability pf l can be
Fig. 20. A new node joins the network
derived from the received Signal-to-noise ratio. This ratio can
be conveniently measured by transmitting pilot packages via
the link.
Once both link transition probabilities prc and pf l are
known, the cycle probabilities of the peer path can be com-
puted according to Equation (12).

[0.6573, 0.2485, 0.0707, 0.0180] Rβ = 99.45%
Coming back to the example, we assume that path 1 involves
2 hops and path 2 involves 1 hop, and that their links have the
same stationary availability π(up) = 0.83. Assume that the
SNR of the channel between node 3 and node 5 is measured
and normalized to Eb/E03 = 7, while the SNR of the channel
between node 4 and node 5 is measured and normalized to

With these path parameters, the performance of the two ex-
isting paths and the two peer paths can be analyzed. We denote
the compositional path via node 3 as path α and the other
compositional path via node 4 as path β. The corresponding
cycle probability functions and reachability probabilities can
be derived and are summarized in Table IV for a reporting
interval of Is = 4.
The reachability probabilities of both paths are about the
same, i.e. Reα ≈ Rβ. Hence, we further compare their delay
measures. Since path α consists of 3 hops and path β only
has 2 hops, path α needs one more slot in the communication
s + 1, and the expected
schedule. As a consequence, F α
delay of path α will be longer than that of path β, i.e. E[τ]α =
E[τ]β +10(ms). Hence, to achieve a better performance, path
β is preferred.
s = F β

wireless solutions in industry and process automation is still
at the initial phase. In 2007, WirelessHART was approved by
the IEC as the ﬁrst international standard speciﬁcally aimed
at wireless control for factory automation industry.
Most of the recent research focuses on ﬁnding routing and
scheduling algorithms or on network simulation, however,
the performance of WirelessHART networks has not received
much attention, yet. This paper presents a general model for
WirelessHART networks and speciﬁcally takes into account
the possibly different physical layer of each link. Moreover it
allows to analyze networks with different reporting intervals.
Based on this model, different quality of service measures can
be computed, namely reachability, delay and utilization.
To facilitate the analysis of WirelessHART networks, we
have developed a tool to automatically derive the underlying
DTMC of a network for a speciﬁed communication schedule,
routing graph and reporting interval and to directly compute
measures of interest. The tool was developed in Java SE
Runtime Environment version 1.6 using the Eclipse Indigo
platform.
We have evaluated a typical WirelessHART network and
analyzed the inﬂuence of link availability, hop count and the
size of the reporting interval and the network stability.
The evaluation shows that although the performance of
WirelessHART network is inﬂuenced by these factors, it is
capable to deliver reliable service under typical
industrial
environments. As a control system, the stability of control
loops is a critical issue. Future work will strive to include the
computed reachability probabilities directly into the control
loop, in order to analyze the stability of a control loop.
