during the time window (about 70%), it also appears that a few occurred a lot

Global picture. Analysis of pseudo-events properties provide us with the fol-
lowing global picture. BGP dynamics are mostly made of short termed instabil-
ities producing limited path exploration. This would suggest that classic solu-
tions for BGP dynamics regulation such as MRAI timers [29] or route ﬂap damp-
ing [34] are eﬃcient (see gaps on Fig. 4a at 30 s and 60 s, most likely due to MRAI
eﬀects, pointing out its ability to limit path exploration). However, results also
point out that instabilities are recurrent. In such situations, classical mechanisms
are ineﬀective by design. To be tackled, recurrent instabilities would require
advanced contention mechanisms, able to learn and recognize them, which we
intend to investigate as part of our future work.
4.2 Second Use Case: Anomaly Detection
We now show how information provided by primary paths can be leveraged for
anomaly detection. Speciﬁcally, we use as reference the list of noteworthy BGP
212
T. Green et al.
events published by a well-known alert service, BGPmon [4], which classiﬁes
events as either (i) AS or country-level outages, (ii) hijacks and (iii) leaks, and
for each event reports the inferred starting time. We argue that the usefulness of
pseudo-events is better assessed by focusing on AS-level outages (i.e., an outage
on AS x is an event impacting preﬁxes originated by AS x) and hijacks (a hijack
on AS x by AS y is identiﬁed whenever AS y has originated some route for a preﬁx
p, such that p is a preﬁx, or a more speciﬁc preﬁx, legitimately originated by AS
x). Notice indeed that country-level outages and leaks would require to use IP
geolocation databases or AS relationships databases respectively: clearly, the use
of diﬀerent databases than BGPmon would be a further source of uncertainty,
which would unnecessarily fuzz the comparison.
Considering the same period of our dataset (January 1st to March 31st 2017),
BGPmon lists 2369 events (1716 outages and 653 hijacks). Since we are using
diﬀerent (and fewer) vantage points than BGPmon, we need to remove non
observable events. We perform this sanitization using BGP updates. For each
event starting at time tBGP mon we deﬁne a time window as |t − tBGP mon| , then we compare it to the path in the update

As reported in Table 3b, for 173 (56.5%) hijacks we agree with BGPmon.
For 133 (43.5%) hijacks we disagree with BGPmon, either explicitly (37 hijacks)
or implicitly (96 hijacks). Investigating the reasons for this important number
of disagreements, we discover that 103 of them have occurred in March and
impacted the same origin AS (AS 13489) and preﬁx (2800::/12)1. In other words,
during March this very preﬁx and origin AS was hijacked 103 times, moreover
by tens of diﬀerent ASes originating preﬁxes all more speciﬁc than 2800::/12.
Analyzing Regional Internet Registries (RIR) statistics ﬁles which summarize
the current state of Internet number resource allocations and assignments, and
executing whois requests on RIR’s databases, it appears that 2800::/12 is not
allocated nor assigned (at the time of writing). This preﬁx, which started being
originated by AS13489 on March 3rd (according to our dataset) should not have
therefore been routed (it was no longer routed at the time of writing). On the
contrary, the RIR’s databases also indicates that 11622 preﬁxes more speciﬁc
than 2800::/12 have legitimately been allocated or assigned. This more likely
illegitimate origination of 2800::/12 by AS13489 would therefore have triggered
hijacks detection by BGPmon for any legitimate update related to any more
speciﬁc preﬁx than 2800::/12. As a conclusion, we are reassured in the relevance
of primary paths for hijack detection. The remaining 30 hijacks are marked as
disagreement, though reasons of disagreement are still uncertain and require
further investigation.
1 We are aware that this preﬁx was used in Czyz et al. [11]. We believe that the
events are unrelated because they do not match either the involved parties, the time
window, or the methodology described.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper discusses the concepts of primary paths (most used inter-domain
paths in a time period) and pseudo-events (primary path unavailability peri-
ods). Using three months of BGP updates at a collector, we verify our assump-
tion to hold, and show how to take advantage of the inter-domain stability by
augmenting the stream of BGP updates with primary paths, thus creating a new
stream of pseudo-events. This new stream exhibits interesting characteristics for
BGP dynamics analysis, as shown on two use cases. First, it helps us in build-
ing tomographic views of the inter-domain structure, uncovering or conﬁrming
many temporal and topological characteristics. Second, our comparison with the
BGPmon alert service indicates that the knowledge of the primary path can be
used for anomaly detection. It enables to promptly detect any deviation from
this nominal behavior, and is also helpful in characterizing the type of deviation.
Therefore, primary paths provide a powerful repository to interpret BGP
updates, and this paper just scratches the surface of their usage. As part of
our ongoing work, we are investigating their topological properties (to correlate
pseudo-events), analyzing temporal properties of structural pseudo-events (to
characterize primary paths turnover), with the purpose of proposing an online
framework to detect and mitigate BGP events.
