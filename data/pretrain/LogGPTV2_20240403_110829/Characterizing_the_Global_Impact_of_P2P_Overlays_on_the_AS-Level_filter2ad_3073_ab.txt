ASes that host most peers, and (ii) the constraint imposed by valley-free routing
over the hierarchical structure of the AS-level underlay.
To further investigate the underlying causes for the observed skewed nature
of observed load on transit ASes, we examine the distribution of the number of
unique AS-paths (associated with overlay connections) that pass through each
transit AS. The shape of this distribution is very similar to Figure 1(b) (not
shown), suggesting that the number of crossing connections for individual ASes
is primarily determined by the underlay shape and routing rather than connectiv-
ity and footprint of the overlay. Figure 1(c) validates this observation by showing
a scatterplot of the number of crossing AS-paths (x-axis) and number of over-
lay connections (y-axis) through each transit AS. This ﬁgure essentially relates
the previous two distributions and conﬁrms that the observed load on individual
transit ASes depends primarily on the number of unique AS-paths crossing those
ASes. Note that once the number of cross AS-paths exceeds a certain threshold
(a few hundreds), the observed load increases at a much faster pace.
Identity and Evolution of Transit ASes: To investigate the observed load
by transit ASes from a diﬀerent angle, we examine and present the identity
of the top-10 transit ASes that carry the highest number of crossing overlay

Fig. 2. (a) Distribution of AS-path length between connected edge ASes, (b) Distri-
bution of AS-path length for all overlay connections
connections (and their evolution over time) in Figure 1(d). For each of the four
overlay snapshots, the transit ASes are rank-ordered (highest load ﬁrst), and the
ﬁgure depicts their standings in these rank-ordered lists over time. We observe
that only four transit ASes (i.e., AT&T, AOL, Level3, and Cogent) remain in
the top-10 list across all four snapshots and that the changes in the other transit
ASes is more chaotic. This is due to the fact that ranking of transit ASes is af-
fected by a combination of factors including changes in the topology of AS-level
underlay, in routing policies, and in the location of peers. Disentangling these
diﬀerent factors and trying to identify the root causes for the observed churn
among the top-10 transit ASes over time remains a challenging open problem.
AS-Path Length: One way to quantify the impact of an overlay on the AS-
level underlay is to characterize the length of AS-paths for individual overlay
connections. Figure 2(a) shows the empirical density of the length of all AS-
paths between edge ASes for each of the four snapshots. We observe that around
40% of the paths are three AS-hops long, while 80% of the paths in each overlay
are at most 4 AS-hops long.
Figure 2(b) depicts the empirical density of AS-path length across all overlay
connections for each of the four snapshots. In essence, this plot can be viewed as
a weighted version of Figure 2(a) described above where the length of each path
is weighted by the number of overlay connections crossing it. The ﬁgure shows a
very similar pattern across all overlay snapshots despite the changes in the num-
ber of peers and their connections. The two ﬁgures are very similar, however the
average path length across the overlay connections is slightly shorter indicating
that a slightly higher fraction of connections are associated with shorter paths.
(e.g., for G-07, the average length of all AS-paths is 3.2 hops while the average
path length across overlay connections is 3.7 hops.)
Propagation of Traﬃc through the AS-Level Hierarchy: An interesting
way to quantify the load that an overlay imposes on the AS-level underlay is
to determine the fraction of load that is propagated upward in the AS-level
hierarchy towards the top-tiered ASes. Table 2 gives the percentage of paths

and percentage of overlay connections whose top AS is a tier-1, tier-2, and tier-3
AS, respectively, in each overlay snapshot. The columns marked “Path” give the
percentage of the relevant AS-paths reaching each tier while the columns marked
“Conn” represent the percentage of the overlay connections (i.e., aggregate load)
reaching each tier. We note that more than half of the paths reach a tier-1 AS,
and roughly 40% of the paths peak at a tier-2 AS across all four snapshots.
The percentage of connections that reach a tier-1 AS is even higher than that
for paths, indicating that a larger fraction of connections are mapped to these
paths. At the same time, a lower percentage of connections reach a tier-2 AS (16%
to 37%) compared to paths that peak in tier-2 ASes. Interestingly, the percentage
of connections that reach a tier-1 AS decreases over time while the percentage of
connections that peak in a tier-2 AS is increasing. A plausible explanation of this
trend is the increasing connectivity over time between ASes in the lower tiers
which reduces the fraction of connections that have to climb the hierarchy up to
tier-1 ASes. A closer examination (not shown here) conﬁrmed that this shift in
traﬃc towards lower tiers is indeed primarily due to the presence of shortcuts
between lower-tier ASes in the AS topology (e.g., more aggressive peering at
Internet exchange points over time). In particular, the observed shift has little
to do with changes in the overlay topology, mainly because the connectivity of
the Gnutella overlay has not become signiﬁcantly more localized over time.
4 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we studied the problem of quantifying the load that a particular
overlay imposes on the AS-level underlay. We identiﬁed the challenging aspects
of this problem and described existing techniques to address each of these as-
pects. Relying on an existing set of best practices, we presented a methodology
for mapping the load of an application-level overlay onto the AS-level underlay.
We illustrated our methodology with an example of a real-world P2P overlay
(i.e., Gnutella). While our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the
interactions between application-level overlays and the AS-level underlay in to-
day’s Internet, a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of our results to known
overlay-speciﬁc issues, known underlay-related problems (e.g., incomplete AS
graph, ambiguous AS relationships), and known BGP-related diﬃculties (e.g., ,
limitations of the C-BGP simulator) looms as important next step.
As part of our future work, we plan to investigate how changing the geo-
graphical location of peers and their connectivity aﬀect the load imposed on
10

the AS-level underlay. Furthermore, we plan to derive realistic traﬃc models for
diﬀerent P2P application and incorporate them into our methodology. Finally,
we intend to examine pricing models that are used by ISPs to determine how
structure and workload of an overlay aﬀect the revenues of the various ISPs in
the AS hierarchy of the underlay.
