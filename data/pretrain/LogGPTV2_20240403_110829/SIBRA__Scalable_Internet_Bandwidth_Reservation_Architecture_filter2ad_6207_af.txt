a link’s bandwidth.
is still
important for some types of low-
bandwidth connections: email, news, and SSH trafﬁc
could continue as best-effort trafﬁc, totaling 3.69% of
the Internet trafﬁc [22]; similar the case for DNS trafﬁc
totaling 0.17% of the Internet trafﬁc [22]. In addition,
very short-lived ﬂows (that is ﬂows with a lifetime less
than 256 ms) with very few packets (the median ﬂow
contains 37 packets [39]) are unlikely to establish SIBRA
reservations, simply to avoid the round-trip time of the
reservation setup. Such ﬂows sum up to 5.6% of the
Internet trafﬁc [39] and can thus also be categorized under
best-effort.
• Finally, regarding the amount of bandwidth for steady
paths and connection-establishment trafﬁc, we conducted
an experiment using the inter-AS trafﬁc summary by a
DDoS detection system at one of the largest tier-1 ISPs.
With a 10-day recording of this data, we found that only
0.5% of the 1.724× 1013 packets were connection estab-
lishment packets. To enable communication guarantees
for low-bandwidth trafﬁc, including bandwidth reserva-
tion request packets, we designed SIBRA to allocate ten-
fold of the amount measured.
Since it is hard to specify the actual bandwidth proportions
precisely, we use 80%, 15%, and 5% as initial values and note
that these values can be re-adjusted at any point in the future.
in addition to the
parameter choice, SIBRA’s statistical multiplexing between
the trafﬁc classes helps to dynamically balance the trafﬁc.
We expect that in particular the long-lived reservations are not
We recall from Section III-D that,

neighbors (medium colors) potentially buying guaranteed bandwidth.

using the AS topology from CAIDA9 in the following setting.
We considered a set of initial adopters, tier-1 ISPs selected
uniformly at random. Potential adopters in the next deployment
round are the neighbors of the deploying nodes, as depicted
in Figure 9, such that there is always a contiguous region
of deploying ASes. We consider rational potential adopters,
which deploy SIBRA only if they can monetize the guaranteed-
bandwidth service by selling it to their neighbors. Such neigh-
bors would buy the service if the trafﬁc they originate can
use DILLs up to their destinations. Thus, we compare the
trafﬁc originating at a buyer neighbor AS that can use DILLs,
compared to the total amount of trafﬁc originating at
the
same neighbor AS. Since trafﬁc information between ASes is
usually conﬁdential, we approximate the trafﬁc using a model
introduced by Chan et al. [11]: the trafﬁc between a source and
a destination AS is represented by the product of the ASes’
IP spaces. We obtained the data on the AS-IP-space mapping
from CAIDA10.
When the set of initial deployers consists of three ASes,
next round adopters could monetize SIBRA on a percentage
of trafﬁc between 40% – 48%. Four initial adopters lead to
potential SIBRA trafﬁc of 47% – 49%, and ﬁve initial adopters
to 50% – 52%. We conclude that deployment starting at the
Internet core greatly leverages the incremental deployment of
SIBRA.
VII. USE CASES
With the ﬂexible lifetime of DILLs, ranging from tens of sec-
onds to weeks on-demand, SIBRA brings immediate beneﬁts
to applications where guaranteed availability matters. These
applications comprise critical infrastructures, such as ﬁnancial
services and smart electric grids, as well as business applica-
tions, such as videoconferencing and reliable data sharing in
health care. As discussed above, setting up leased lines in these
cases may take several weeks and may become prohibitively
expensive: it is costly to install leased lines between each pair
of domains, and also to connect each domain through a leased
line to a central location in order to build up a star topology.
Critical
instance
transaction processing from payment terminals, would become
more reliable when using SIBRA DILLs: since DILLs guar-
antee availability even in the presence of adversarial trafﬁc,
payment requests and their conﬁrmations would always obtain
a guaranteed minimum bandwidth. DILLs could also be used
for remote monitoring of power grids: a minimum guaran-

always fully utilized, in which case best-effort trafﬁc can be
transmitted instead.
B. Per-ﬂow stateless operations are necessary
To understand the amount of per-ﬂow storage state required
on the fastpath, we investigate the number of active ﬂows per
second as seen by a core router in today’s Internet. We used
anonymized one-hour Internet traces from CAIDA, collected
in July 2014. The traces contain all the packets that traversed
a 10 Gbps Internet core link of a Tier-1 ISP in the United
States, between San Jose and Los Angeles.
Figure 10 depicts our ﬁndings as the number of active
ﬂows on the core link at a granularity of one second, for a
total duration of 412 seconds. We observe that the number
of ﬂows varies around 220 000, with a boundary effect at the
beginning of the data set. These ﬂows sum into a throughput
between 3 and 4 Gbps — a link load of 30% to 40%. A
large core router switching 1 Tbps (with 100 such 10 Gbps
links) would thus observe 22×106 ﬂows per second in the
normal case, considering a link load of only 40%. In an attack
case, adversaries could greatly inﬂate the number of ﬂows
by launching connections between bots, as in Coremelt [38].
Schuchard et al. already analyzed attacks that can exhaust the
router memory [34]. All these results suggest storing per-ﬂow
state in the fastpath, on the line card, becomes prohibitively
expensive, even more so when the core link load increases.
C. Case study: achievable ephemeral bandwidth on core links
A central point of SIBRA is to guarantee a sufﬁcient amount
of bandwidth using today’s infrastructure, even for reservations
that span multiple ISDs. A central question is how much
bandwidth an end-domain could minimally obtain if globally
all domains attempt to obtain their maximum fair share. To
investigate this point, we considered a scenario with Australia
as destination, and all non-Australian leaf ASes in the world
reserving ephemeral bandwidth to Australia. We picked Aus-
tralia because with its 24 million inhabitants, it represents
a major economy, and it already experienced infrastructure
congestion in today’s Internet [3]. While its geographical
location hinders laying new cables, Australia is well-suited for
our study aiming to determine a lower bound on the amount
of bandwidth SIBRA core links can expect. Other countries,
especially those situated on larger continents, typically feature
higher-bandwidth connectivity, as laying cables on land is
easier than in the ocean.
Fig. 11: Australia submarine link map, including link capacities.
Figure 11 illustrates the current submarine link map of
Australia, including the name and capacity of the links.11 The
entire trafﬁc traverses these links. For simplicity, we assume
guaranteed bandwidth is split equally between leaf ASes. In
practice, however, the bandwidth is proportional to the size of
the steady paths of the leaf ASes (Section III). We considered
two cases: (i) the worst case, i.e., when all reservations are
squeezed over the same link — in our case, we chose the
highest-bandwidth cable, namely the Australia-Japan Cable
(6 Tbps), and (ii) the best case, i.e., when the reservations
are distributed across all cables (totaling 15.04 Tbps). In con-
trast to other architectures, SIBRA’s underlying architecture,
SCION, enables the use of multi-path communication for the
trafﬁc between a source and a destination, along several core
links.
We have determined the number of leaf ASes in the world,
using the AS topology from CAIDA9, and counted 32 428 non-
Australian leaf ASes using the AS number and location12.
After the analysis, we found that each non-Australian leaf
AS obtains a fair share of (i) 185.02 Mbps (148 Mbps for
ephemeral
trafﬁc), or (ii) 463.86 Mbps (371.08 Mbps for
ephemeral trafﬁc). We thus conclude that SIBRA’s fair sharing
scheme offers a substantial amount of bandwidth through an
efﬁcient use of the current Internet
infrastructure. In case
this amount is insufﬁcient, an AS could purchase additional
bandwidth for a speciﬁc destination from its core AS.
The prospects are even brighter: considering the planned
undersea physical infrastructure development, the capacity of
the cables connecting Australia with the rest of the world
would increase by 168 Tbps by the beginning of 2018. With
such an increase, the fair share on SIBRA’s core links becomes
5.64 Gbps per leaf AS in case (ii).

Capability-based mechanisms [7, 19, 24, 30, 32, 44, 46]

trafﬁc. Network capabilities are access tokens issued by on-
path entities (e.g., routers and destination) to the source.
Only packets carrying such network capabilities are allowed
to use a privileged channel. Capability-based schemes, how-

of Capability attacks [8] and against attacks with colluding
hosts or legitimate-looking bots [21, 38]. To address DoC
attacks, TVA [46] tags each packet with a path identiﬁer
which is based on the ingress interface of the traversing
ASes. The path identiﬁer is used to perform fair queueing of
the request packets at the routers. However, sources residing
further away from the congested link will suffer a signiﬁcant
disadvantage. Portcullis [32] deploys computational puzzles
to provide per-computation fair sharing of the request chan-
nel. Such proof-of-work schemes, however, are too expensive
to protect every data packet. Moreover, Portcullis does not
provide the property of botnet-size independence. Floc [24]
fair-shares link bandwidth of individual ﬂows and differentiates
between legitimate and attack ﬂows for a given link. However,
such coarse-grained per-AS fair sharing may not always be
effective; in particular, low-rate attack ﬂows can often not be
precisely differentiated. CoDef [25] is a collaborative defense
mechanism in which a congested AS asks the source ASes
to limit their bandwidth to a speciﬁc upper bound and to
use a speciﬁc path. Source ASes that continue sending ﬂows
that exceed their requested quota are classiﬁed as malicious.
CoDef does not prevent congestion in the ﬁrst place, but
instead retroactively handles one congested link at a time.
Since congestion can still occur on links, sources cannot be
given a guarantee for reaching a destination. STRIDE [19]
is a capability-based DDoS protection architecture that builds
on several concepts from SCION [9, 48]. Although STRIDE
shares similarities with SIBRA (steady paths and ephemeral
paths), STRIDE lacks intra-core and inter-ISD communication
guarantees; STRIDE’s intra-domain guarantees are built on
the assumption of congestion-free core networks. Moreover,
STRIDE lacks monitoring and policing mechanisms, as well
as an implementation.
Resource allocation. Several queuing protocols [31, 35, 37]
have been proposed to approximate fair bandwidth allocation
at routers. Their correctness, however, relies on the trustwor-
thiness of the routers and ﬂow identiﬁers. The Path Computa-
tion Element (PCE) architecture [13, 40] computes inter-AS
routes and enables resource allocation across AS boundaries in
Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Trafﬁc
Engineered networks. However, the discovery of inter-AS PCE
path fragments discloses information about other cooperating
AS, such as the internal topology. Some ASes will be reluctant
to share this information due to conﬁdentiality reasons.
Resource reservation. RSVP [47] is a signaling protocol for
bandwidth reservation. Because RSVP is not designed with
security in mind, the reservation may fail due to DDoS attacks.
RSVP requires the sender (e.g., a host or an AS when RSVP
aggregation is used as speciﬁed in RFC 3175) to make an
end-to-end reservation to the receiver(s), causing a quadratic
number of control messages (in the number of entities) in the
network and quadratic state on the intermediate routers.
X. CONCLUSIONS
Through hierarchical decomposition of resource reservations,
SIBRA is the ﬁrst scalable architecture that provides inter-
domain bandwidth guarantees — achieving botnet-size inde-
pendence and resolving even sophisticated DDoS attacks such
as Coremelt [38] and Crossﬁre [21]. SIBRA ends the arms
race between DDoS attackers and defenders, as it provides
guaranteed resource reservations regardless of the attacker’s
botnet size. A salient property of SIBRA is that it can be built
without requiring per-ﬂow state in the fastpath of a router,
resulting in a simple router design and high-speed packet
processing. We anticipate that SIBRA becomes a game changer
in the battle against large-scale DDoS attacks.
