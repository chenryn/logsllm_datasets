User: Is it possible to lookup what code called (delay(), apply_async(), apply(), etc.) a task from within the task's code?  Strings would be fine.  Ideally, I would like to get the caller's stack trace.
Assistant: Short answer is no and that is by design.
Long answer is yes, you can always send in unneeded information to the worker whose sole purpose is to identify the caller and the caller's state.
