Evidence connecting that identity to an action
Least Privilege
If you ever take a certification exam, you may see this as principle of least privilege (PoLP) and even principle of least authority (PoLA). It is a concept that reduces the accidental or purposeful attack surface of an organization. There are several ways through access management you can use this concept to protect your ecosystem. In IT, we learn from others' mistakes.
About a decade ago, I was an administrator on a network with about 12,000 machines and 9,000 users. We used Group Policy in Windows to control the working environment. It was a way to centralize management of users' settings, applications, and operating systems in an Active Directory environment. We had someone new to the organization who was full of great ideas but was not aware of or willing to follow the change management procedures we had put in place to safeguard the network.
He changed a major feature in Group Policy that had catastrophic results. In the Event Viewer on a Windows machine you can configure your security logs. He checked the box to not overwrite security logs and pushed it out to 12,000 machines using Group Policy objects. If you've been IT for a while, you might be cringing. Within 24 hours, he had locked out 9,000 users on our network by filling up the allotted log space for successful and failed logon/logoff events. Thankfully, we were able to fix the problem within about 30 minutes after we had figured out what had happened. At first, we had thought we were under attack. Through nonrepudiation, we knew which admin had been logged into the system when the change occurred.
Here are the morals of this story:
If you're not sure what you're doing, then ask.
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
If you limit who has access to critical systems, you reduce your attack surface.
Most devices have mechanisms built in where you have standard end‐user and administrator accounts. Administrator accounts are for users who need full access to all areas of the machine where user accounts are restricted; users can run applications but do not have full administrative access.
One reason this principle works so well is that it will make you do internal research on what privileges at what level are actually needed. Unfortunately, the path of least resistance in many organizations has been the overuse of accounts with deep and far‐reaching privilege. The consequences of a network administrator opening an email attachment that launches malware while logged into the domain administrator's account are that the malware will have administrator's privilege on the domain and unrestricted access to the network. If the network administrator is logged into a standard end‐user account, the malware only has access to the user's data, and the potential compromise scope is much smaller.
You should default to creating a separate standard user account for every user including administrators, and every account should use at least single‐factor authentication. This enables you to control what the users can install and websites they can visit. Too many organizations allow all users on their network administrative privileges, and it creates a massive attack surface. Administrators should always log in using their standard user account and then use the Run As Administrator feature to run those programs they need elevated privileges to use. There are far too many breaches that get traced back to administrators opening email and clicking a link that leads to a malicious download that compromises an asset that spreads through a network and steals everything. Not only do organizations lose intellectual property, but they end up fined for violations of compliance, which can lead to a loss of millions in a single breach.
One of the best ways to start implementing the PoLP is to start with a privileged audit. A user account created to use a database does not need admin rights like a programmer building the database. You do not want to hinder your end users; you want to give them only enough access to perform their required job.
Do an audit of privilege on a regular basis. This is not a one‐and‐done exercise. It is operational. Who has access to what, and who has changed jobs and retained access to their old permissions?
Start every account as low as possible. Only add higher permissions if needed/requested and only for the time needed. An auditor may need elevated privileges but only for the duration of the audit.
Separation of duties (SoD) is a strategic function of least privilege. You have one person write the check and one person sign the check. By having more than one person accomplish a task, it can help prevent fraud or errors. In the Group Policy story earlier, SoD was part of that process. If the employee had followed procedures for change management, I could have told him why it was a really bad idea.
By implementing least privilege, you can even improve operational performance, reduce the chance of unauthorized behavior, reduce the attack surface, and reduce the chances of malicious software propagating since it might need elevated processes to run. One of the biggest benefits of implementing least privilege is that it makes it easier to meet compliance requirements. Many compliance regulations such as PCI‐DSS, HIPAA, FISMA, and SOX require that organizations apply least privilege to ensure proper data management and security.
The Federal Desktop Core Configuration requirements by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) say that federal employees must log into PCs with standard privileges. PCI‐DSS 3.0 7.2.2 requires assignment of privileges to individuals based on job classification and function.
Single Sign‐On
Working in our modern‐day environments requires us to log into multiple programs to get our jobs done. We have to log into customer management databases, share resources in cloud applications, check email, and create documentation online. It can be a headache for the average user to remember all those usernames and passwords. To alleviate that issue, we use single sign‐on (SSO) applications. SSO is another form of access control between multiple, interrelated software systems.
Benefits of single sign‐on can include the reduction of password fatigue or having end users write their passwords on sticky notes and put them on their monitor or under the keyboard. It can save time typing in passwords over and over and ideally reduce help‐desk issues of people calling in because they went on vacation and forgot their password and locked themselves out. One of the big criticisms of SSO is the access to many different resources from just one login. To combat this issue, we have to focus on protecting the “keys to the kingdom” and combine this with strong verification like multifactor authentication.
The CIA triad shown in Figure 8.1 is used to find the right balance for an organization based on priorities. Some organizations like the military's preference toward confidentiality, where organizations such as Amazon might lean toward availability. After all, the military does not want its secrets leaked, and you cannot purchase from a website if the site is down.
Figure 8.1: CIA triad
Confidentiality is a set of rules that limit access to information, integrity is the assurance that the information is accurate, and availability is giving the right information access to the right people. Network and security IT administrators have to find a balance between protecting the environment and meeting compliance without hindering the workflow of the end users. If you tighten controls too tight, users cannot do their job, but if controls are too lax, it results in a vulnerability. If you're not careful, end users will start saving their credentials in their browser for easy login into their favorite banking or shopping websites. They may even save their corporate credentials, which could be catastrophic if the machine is ever accessed by non‐authorized individuals.
As a security leader in your organization, you have decisions to make. The problem with making decisions today is your enterprise will mostly likely change tomorrow. Most of the processes we use in IT are cyclic, always subject to reevaluation. When your security maturity model reaches the point where building and documenting AAA, least privilege, and SSO into your management process, every individual from CEO to the security administrator needs his or her access configuration audited. In Figure 8.2, you see a simple matrix of users' needs when it comes to accessing their network. Once you know what users need to perform their role, it becomes easy to build that role for them.
Figure 8.2: Evaluating users' needs in your network
JumpCloud
According to Zach DeMeyer at JumpCloud, “Generally endpoint management solutions have focused solely on managing the system, not including identities and access.” JumpCloud is a cutting‐edge blend of SSO and management of permissions in a network. Users' identities are at the core of JumpCloud as a directory as a service. You create a central, authoritative version of each identity so employees can use a single set of credentials throughout all the resources they need to access. You can set up password complexity and expiration features to ensure policies are met and then, once set up, bind those users to any of the resources connected to JumpCloud from their host system to applications to networks.
To get started, go to jumpcloud.com and create your user account. Your first ten users are completely free, forever. After that, there is a small charge per user. Once your user account is validated through your email, you have access to the central console where you can set up credentials for platform, protocol, or location. You can use JumpCloud to enforce policies, set password requirements including multifactor authentication, and streamline access to most IT resources. Lab 8.1 shows how to create a user, and Lab 8.2 shows how to create a system.
LAB 8.1: CREATING A USER
Open your browser and log into the JumpCloud web interface.
On the Users tab, click the green box with the plus sign (see Figure 8.3).
Figure 8.3: How to create a user in JumpCloud
Define the new user's first name, last name, username, and email address. If you have audited this user's needs, then you will know if you need to enable admin/sudo permissions or require multifactor authentication. In Figure 8.4, you see the New User dialog box. This is where you can add the initial password for the user.
Figure 8.4: The New User dialog box
For each user, you have the ability to add that person to user groups for access permissions, what systems each has permission to sign into, and what directories each needs access to. You will have to build these next to tie them together.
LAB 8.2: CREATING A SYSTEM
Open the systems menu, second from the top. Click the green box with the plus sign to open the New System instructions.
Mac, Windows, and Linux systems are bound to the JumpCloud platform when you install the system agent. Once it is installed, you can remotely and securely manage a system and the accounts on those systems and set policies. The agent is small and checks in through port 443 and reports event data. Align the system you need to manage with the platform at the type of New System.
Each of these will have specific instructions and connection keys. In the case of Windows, you have an agent to download as well as a connect key (see Figure 8.5). When you double‐click the Windows executable, you will be asked for the key during the install process.
Figure 8.5: Download the Windows Agent and use the connect key to complete the installation.
Copy and paste the connect key into the install file to bind the JumpCloud agent to your system. In a few moments, you will see the hostname displayed in Systems page.
After the asset has successfully checked in, you can apply policies to that asset. By default, Windows has 22 policies you can configure. Figure 8.6 shows a few of them. One best practice is to set up a lock screen.
Figure 8.6: Configuring Windows policies
The lock screen can help you not fall victim to donut day. Donut day is when you leave your computer unlocked, step away or turn your back for a moment, and someone takes advantage of you being logged in. That person will send an email to everyone saying, “I'm bringing the donuts tomorrow!” Everyone knows you left the machine unlocked. Some organizations I've worked for had a prank where they would change our wallpaper to My Little Pony and called it getting pwned. You must lock your computer, and if you forget, a policy can do it for you. It can be an expensive lesson to bring donuts for 250 people. In Figure 8.7, you see the Windows Lock Screen policy and the ability to set the timeout in seconds. Again, you have to balance the CIA triad with usability. I have seen an executive, frustrated with the lockout policy, place a “perpetual drinking bird” next to his keyboard to peck his keyboard and simulate activity so he didn't have to type in his password every 60 seconds.
Figure 8.7: Windows Lock Screen policy
Now that you have a user, a system, and a policy, it's time to evaluate groups, applications, and directories. Each of these will have its own impact on the security posture of your organization. With groups, you have the ability to provide your users and admins access to resources while pulling them into a central management portal. To add another layer of security, giving users the ability to use SSO to sign into an application will enhance these processes. Finally, building a directory will allow you to synchronize user accounts and enable JumpCloud to act as a single authoritative directory of users.
The goal is to work your way through the CIS controls. CIS Control 5 is controlling IM and AM. With controlled use of the correct privileges on computers, networks, and applications, you protect information and assets from theft and misuse. It becomes even more important because you have to deal with the monumental outside threat but also insiders doing things they shouldn't be doing. It can be a daunting task, but it is essential.

Solarwinds Kiwi
When I was growing up, my older brother was a Trekkie, a Star Trek fan. James T. Kirk, the captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, would make entries into a captain's log. The captain's log has been a form of record keeping since the first captains sailed the seas. The log was used to inform the captain's superiors, either owners of the ship or governmental entities, what was happening while exploring or completing a mission or to record historical facts for future generations. Our networks work the same way. Every device on your network generates some type of log‐in some type of language. Some of it is human readable, and some looks like gibberish. Some logs are more useful than others, and we should understand which ones need to be preserved for future analysis. You don't need to log everything, but what you do log should be purposely collected and managed.
CIS Control 6 is the maintenance, monitoring, and analysis of audit logs. Our organizations are evolving quickly, and we have to learn to deal with log data in the big data cloud era. Analyzing audit logs is a vital part of security, not just for system security but for processes and compliance. Part of the process of log analysis is reconciling logs from different sources and correlation even if those devices are in different time zones. If you look at a basic network topology, you will have many types of devices, including routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and workstations. Each of these devices that helps connect you to the rest of the world will generate logs based on its operating systems, configuration, and software. Examining logs is one of the most effective ways of looking for issues and troubleshooting issues occurring on a system or an application.
Synchronization and the ability to correlate the data between these devices are vital to a healthy environment. When I first started in IT, you could get away with occasionally using logs for troubleshooting. Attackers can hide their activities on machines if logging is not done correctly; therefore, you need a strategic method of consolidating and auditing all your logs. Without solid audit log analysis, an attack can go unnoticed for a long time. According to the 2018 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 87 percent of compromises took minutes or less to occur, and 68 percent went undiscovered for months. The full report was based on detailed analysis of more than 53,000 security incidents, including 2,216 data breaches. You can download the full details at verizonenterprise.com/DBIR2018.
Windows Event Viewer
A Windows event log is one of the first tools to use to learn to analyze problems. As a security administrator, you must ensure that local logging is enabled on systems and networking devices. The process that can create an audit log is usually required to run in privileged mode so that users cannot stop or change it. To view logs on a Windows asset through a graphic user interface (GUI) like you see in Figure 9.1, you have to open the Event Viewer.
Figure 9.1: Windows Event Viewer displaying logs
Events are placed into three different categories, each of which is related to a log that Windows keeps. While there are a lot of categories, the majority of troubleshooting and investigation happens in the application, system, or security log.
Application The application log records events related to Windows components like drivers.
System The system log records events about programs installed.
Security When security logging is enabled, this log records events related to security, such as logon attempts and resources accessed.
In Lab 9.1 you'll learn how to examine the Windows security logs.
LAB 9.1: EXAMINING WINDOWS SECURITY LOGS
On a Windows system, use the Windows+R key combination to open the Run menu.
Type eventvwr in the Open field and press Enter.
There are three panes on the Event Viewer screen. The pane to the left is the hierarchy of log files. The pane to the right shows the actions you can take. For a granular view of the logs, you use the large center pane. Open each level of logs by clicking the arrow to the left of the folder or file in the left pane.
Under Windows Logs, click Security. In the center of the page, a list of all security events that have been recorded on this machine is displayed. As you see in Figure 9.2, these are audit successes recorded on this host. To the left, you see actions you can take on these logs, including filtering them for critical events or warnings as well as examining the log properties.
Figure 9.2: Security logs on a Windows machine
When you're familiar with the security logs, open the Application and System folders. These logs will help you understand what applications are running on your machine, what they are doing, and whether they are having difficulties. The System folder is an excellent place to filter critical events such as configuration changes or power loss, as displayed in Figure 9.3.
Figure 9.3: Critical warning on a Windows machine
Windows PowerShell
A shell is typically a user interface that accesses the tools behind the GUI of an operating system. It uses a command‐line interface (CLI) rather than moving and clicking a mouse. It's called a shell because it is the layer outside the operating system's kernel. To use a CLI successfully, you have to be familiar with the proper syntax and commands.
Windows PowerShell is a proprietary Windows command‐line shell designed specifically for administrators. My favorite feature of a command shell is the ability to speed up the processes by using command‐line completion, a lifesaver for those of us who are horrible typists. In the command shell, type a few characters of a command and press the Tab key a couple of times until the item you want appears. Another feature of PowerShell is the ability to save sequences of commands that you might want to reuse in the future. This feature allows you to press the up arrow to cycle through previous commands.
PowerShell introduced the cmdlet (pronounced “command‐let”). It is a simple, single‐function command‐line tool built into the shell. A cmdlet is a specific order you give the OS to perform an action like “run this program.” There are more than 200 cmdlets that are written as a verb‐noun pair. For example, you can type the command Get‐Help, and this will give you a description of a cmdlet.
Searching logs using PowerShell has an advantage over Windows Event Viewer. You can check for events on remote computers much quicker, which is extremely valuable if you ever do server management. PowerShell will help you generate reports, and since we are all so busy, any automation can help. In Lab 9.2, you'll use Windows PowerShell to review logs.
LAB 9.2: USING WINDOWS POWERSHELL TO REVIEW LOGS
On a Windows system, use the Windows+R key combination to open the Run menu. Type in powershell and press Enter.
To get a list of event logs on the local machine, as shown in Figure 9.4, type the following command:
Figure 9.4: Getting a list in PowerShell of available locations of logs
Get-EventLog -List
To get the system log in its entirety on the local computer, type in the following command:Get-EventLog -LogName System
The Get‐EventLog command generates a massive list. To narrow down the view, you can display only the last 20 entries in the system log, as shown in Figure 9.5, by pressing the up arrow and adding the following syntax:
Figure 9.5: Retrieving the index, time, type, source, and message of the last 20 system logs
Get-EventLog -LogName System ‐Newest 20
You can specify system log entries related to disk source, as shown in Figure 9.6, by entering the following command:
Figure 9.6: Disk errors and warnings in system logs
Get-EventLog -LogName System  -Source Disk
Windows enables most log files by default, although you might need to define what level of logging you need. Turning on verbose logging, the most detail possible should be done only during a specific event or while trying to track an active, known security incident. If you aren't careful, the volume of logs can take up many terabytes of disk space. Systems have been known to crash because well‐meaning system administrators enabled verbose logging for all systems and then forgot to disable it when troubleshooting was completed. Be sure to put a sticky note on your monitor to remind yourself to revert logging levels after you're done troubleshooting.
Great logging is about pulling out the necessary critical events and alerts from an otherwise overwhelming amount of information. The problem for most admins is not about getting enough information, but getting useful information out of an overwhelming deluge of data.
To enable a security audit policy to capture load failures in the audit logs, open an elevated Command Prompt window by right‐clicking the Cmd.exe shortcut and selecting Run As Administrator. You could also press Windows+R to open the Run box. Type cmd and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run the command as an administrator. In the elevated Command Prompt window, run the following command:
Auditpol /set /Category:System /failure:enable
As you see in Figure 9.7, you should get a success message that you are now logging all security audit logs. You will have to restart the computer for the changes to take effect.
Figure 9.7: Elevated command prompt turning on security audit logs
After you have collected the logs you need and so you do not fill up all the storage on your asset, do not forget to run the following command:
Auditpol /set /Category:System /failure:disable
Searching logs using PowerShell has an advantage over Windows Event Viewer. You can check for events on remote computers much quicker, which is extremely valuable if you ever do server management. There is no need to physically connect to a computer to collect the logs. By using the PowerShell parameter ‐ComputerName, you can connect and pass a command to the remote computer you choose and collect the information you want. If you want to pull all system logs off the computer named PC1, you can by using the following command:
Get-EventLog -ComputerName PC1 -LogName System
One of the integral parts of understanding these logs and their access to remote regions of your network is their IP address. The Internet has run out of IPv4 addresses, and the landscape of the Internet is quickly evolving. IPv4 is the technology that allows us to connect our devices to the web with a unique, numerical IP address consisting of 4 octets separated by a decimal with no number over 255. It looks like 192.168.1.0. Sending data from one computer to another and generating logs while doing so requires an IP address on both devices.
But we are in transition. With so many applications and with the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), we are starting to see more and more IPv6 addresses in our logging. Google collects statistics surrounding IPv6 adoption globally, and the latest numbers indicate that more than 25 percent of Google users access their resources with IPv6. For home users and small businesses, this may take another few years to become an issue, but nearly all modern devices support this new technology.
What you will start seeing in your logs will be a logical network IPv6 address of 128 bits as opposed to the 32 bits in an IPv4 address. IPv6 is written in hexadecimal as opposed to dotted decimal, and the numbers are grouped together in eight groups of four instead of four groups of three. There are some shortening techniques. For example, if the IPv6 address has a grouping of 0000, it will display as ::. Just be aware, if you ever start to see your source address of your logs displaying 32 hexadecimal characters instead of your usual 12, something on your network is using IPv6.
BareTail
Historically, system administrators would drop down into a shell to run tail ‐f to follow logs in real time. Developed by Bare Metal Software, BareTail is an amazing, free, tiny tool that packs quite an impact. You can monitor your logs in real time in a GUI that allows you to navigate between multiple tabs to organize your streams of logs, highlighting and filtering those parts that are important. You can leave it running, and it refreshes constantly.
When you decide you need a tool to watch the flow of your logs, go to www.baremetalsoft.com/baretail to grab the tool. It downloads as baretail.exe, but it does not “install” as a permanent file. You can move this file and run it from any location with extremely flexible configuration options. I usually keep it on a USB.
Once you open BareTail, the first option under the main menu is Open. Click the Open File option to open a dialog box to navigate to the program logs you want to monitor. In Figure 9.8, you see the path to Nexpose to troubleshoot issues or verify confirmed vulnerabilities on your system.
Figure 9.8: Opening a file location to view the log
To look for specific words or strings, open the Highlighting menu next to the Open menu. You have the ability to filter, change the foreground color and/or background color, and type into the string location the keywords you are most interested in. In Figure 9.9, you see that in nse.log, I have targeted the word vulnerable, and I am ignoring if it is displayed in uppercase or lowercase. In this log, if you scroll down some, you may see Vulnerable or Not Vulnerable when it examines a possible vulnerability on an asset. It will find the word you are searching for inside other words if necessary. When you click OK, the highlighted filters you create will stay activated in the log for as long as you have it open.
Figure 9.9: Applying a filter to nse.log to find “vulnerable” assets
Syslog
The amount of digital data we produce is astounding. According to www.internetlivestats.com, Google alone processes more than 40,000 searches every single second. When you click a link, you generate a log. Around the globe, every second of the day, computer networks are generating logs. According to the same website, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day. Honestly, without searching Google to define quintillion, I don't know how many digits that is. So I just Googled it. It's a billion billion, or 18 zeros after the 1.
Some of these logs are routine, and some of these indicate poor network health or a malicious attempt to breach your network. Log files contain a wealth of information to reduce exposure to intruders, malware, and legal issues. Log data needs to be collected, stored, analyzed, and monitored to meet and report on regulatory compliance standards such as HIPAA, FISMA, FERPA, PCI DSS, or the newest global compliance standard focused on privacy, GDPR. This is an incredible and overwhelming task.
Syslog is a way for network devices to send a message to a logging server. It is supported by a wide range of devices. It can be used to log different types of events. Syslog is an awesome way to consolidate logs from many different sources, in different formats, and in massive volumes into a single location. If you don't have a log management strategy in place to monitor and secure connected devices, the results can be difficult to overcome if at all.
Using a syslog server to collect and store syslog messages provides a reliable central repository for log data. Syslog uses UDP communication to send messages to a central collector, also known as a syslog server. Syslog messages are used to troubleshoot network problems, establish forensic evidence, and prove compliance. Forwarding syslog messages to a central syslog server helps you correlate events across your network.
Typically, most Syslog servers have the following components:
Syslog Listener A Syslog server needs to receive messages sent over the network. A listener process gathers syslog data sent over UDP port 514. UDP is not connection oriented, so messages aren't acknowledged. In some cases, network devices will send Syslog data over connection‐oriented TCP 1468 to ensure and confirm delivery.
Database Large networks can generate a huge amount of Syslog data. Most Syslog servers will use a database to store syslog data to search and query.
Management Software With so much data, it is like looking for a specific needle in a haystack. Use a syslog server that automates part of the work. Syslog servers should be able to generate alerts, notifications, and alarms in response to select messages. If you read the Verizon report, you know you have 16 minutes from compromise before the first click on a phishing campaign. As a security administrator, you need to be able to work quickly.
A log management solution aggregates, indexes, parses, and generates metrics. Syslog messages are generated by operating systems and applications—as well as processes on printers, routers, and switches—and are configured to be sent to your syslog server. If your network includes Windows systems, the syslog server can help you manage Windows event log information.
Logs where there are many login attempts on a single account from diverse geographic locations or other suspicious system activities is a situation any administrator will want to investigate. Proactive, automated detection of unusual activity is critical. Cybersecurity is incredibly dynamic, and we do not know every single potential attack pattern in advance, so monitoring for this type of activity is not an easy task. If you don't analyze your logs to see what's going on, you'll never be able to detect suspicious activity.
A baseline is a starting point you can use for comparisons. Create a baseline that represents normal activity on your system so you're aware when there are anomalies occurring. A few failed login attempts by a user might be considered normal, but hundreds or thousands of failed login attempts might point to a brute‐force or malicious attack.
Consolidating and centrally managing all your logs is different from logging each and every event. The big question of what events to record and how much you need to log is a problem best addressed by an audit. With the right coordination, an auditor along with your legal department focused on compliance with a technical CISO's perspective can give consideration as to what the right level of information is. These questions typically need to be answered for every component of your system and be well documented so you are able to easily scale in the future. For most assets, you will probably stick with their defaults. The only major operating system that does not have built‐in support for sending syslog is Microsoft Windows. Windows includes PowerShell, and PowerShell can use the .NET Framework to send UDP packets to a syslog server.
Another crucial thing to think about is your data retention needs. How long do you need to keep the logs? Do you need them for troubleshooting? Are there regulatory or audit requirements that require you to keep the logs for a certain period of time?
When I was teaching CISSP for ISC2, one of the best tools they gave us to teach with was 250 retired questions. I remember one specifically concerning logs:
“You are a system administrator. Your organization's security policy states that you keep logs for 3 years. You have kept logs for 5 years. You have been subpoenaed for 5 years of logs. What do you legally have to give the authorities?”
The answer is you have to turn over everything you have. We have to trust that the management team has put security policies in place for a reason. If we disagree with the policy, it is our responsibility as cyber professionals to pursue a discussion with the chain of command until either we understand why the policy is in place or we change the policy. Otherwise, the violation of keeping records too long could open up potential damaging and sometimes legal issues.
Your daily log volume might already be substantial, but it can increase exponentially when a device fails. The resulting log messages could easily quintuple the number of log messages that get generated.
Log files come in a variety of formats. Some formats follow more traditional standards, while others are completely custom. Your log solution should be able to parse and present the data in a comprehensive form in near real time, and it should allow you to define custom parsing rules. Parsing is breaking down a log into smaller, better digestible messages and putting them into their own groups so that you can analyze and even visualize them in order to identify data inconsistencies.
SolarWinds Kiwi
SolarWinds Kiwi Syslog Server has a free edition where you can collect, view, and archive syslog messages. It is easy to set up and configure how it receives, logs, displays, and forwards syslog messages from network devices, such as routers, switches, Unix hosts, and other syslog‐enabled devices.
The free version of Kiwi will allow you to get statistics in real time from five sources, with summaries available in the console. You will also be able to receive and manage syslog messages from network devices and view syslog messages in multiple windows.
Just like any other software, you will want to make sure that your system meets the hardware and software requirements and that you've opened the appropriate ports so communication can occur. In Kiwi Syslog Server, you will need Windows 7 or newer, Internet access, and at least 4 GB of disk space. Kiwi Syslog Server uses the ports listed in Table 9.1.
