'Such is the way of ALLAH. HE creates what HE pleases. When HE decrees a thing

When Jihad becomes J1H4D
•
Jihad what does the word mean? “Literally 'struggle,' it includes both the 
inward spiritual struggle against human desires and the outward struggle 
against injustice, oppression and the rejection of the truth by non-believers, 
which leads to 'holy war' only when sanctioned by the legitimate political 
authority.

“The funny thing is that so many of the real Al Qaeda websites are hosted in the US,” he says. 
“One simple reason is it’s one of the cheaper places to host. They circulate via mailing lists and 
these sort of out of bounds methods where they can be found. They’re all in Arabic. Not many 
westerners know Arabic, and everything’s fine until some journalist figures out where the website 
is.”

(GIMF), the second version of the Mujahideen Secrets encryption tool was released online 
approximately two days ago, on behalf of the Al-Ekhlaas Islamic Network.

“Those who think that we can stop online terrorism by removal of websites 
are either naive or ignorant about cyberspace and its limitations for 
interference,” says Gabriel Weimann, professor of communication at Haifa 
University in Israel and author of Terrorism on the Internet 
(http://bookstore.usip.org/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=134280).

“As a short answer, there is a need for strategy and not tactics, there is a 
need for a multimeasured approach, and not just “Let's kill those websites.’ 
They reemerge within days or even hours.”

The teams, and the lone gunmen cyber jihadists in this post are : Osama 
Bin Laden's Hacking Crew, Ansar AL-Jihad Hackers Team, HaCKErS 
aLAnSaR, The Designer - Islamic HaCKEr and Alansar Fantom. None of 
these are known to have any kind of direct relationships with terrorist 
groups, therefore they should be considered as terrorist sympathizers.

The U.S. General Accounting Office reports that financing for Al-Qaeda 
operations come from many sources including subscription/membership 
fees, false contracts, counterfeiting/forging currency, robbing state 
banks/bank employee and kidnapping. The Treasury Department has even 
linked three Yemeni honey companies to Osama bin Laden's terrorism-
financing operation.

Western intelligence agencies believe Khan has become the kingpin of a 
heroin-trafficking enterprise that is a principal source of funding for the 
Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorists. A Western law-enforcement official in Kabul 
who is tracking Khan says agents in Pakistan and Afghanistan, after a tip-off 
in May, turned up evidence that Khan is employing a fleet of cargo ships to 
move Afghan heroin out of the Pakistani port of Karachi. The official says at 
least three vessels on return trips from the Middle East took arms like 
plastic explosives and antitank mines, which were secretly unloaded in 
Karachi and shipped overland to al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters.

• Let's discuss what cyber jihad isn't. Cyber jihad is 
anything but shutting down the critical infrastructure of a 
country in question, despite the potential for blockbuster 
movie scenario here. It's news stories like these, 
emphasizing on abusing the Internet medium for 
achieving their objectives in the form of recruitment, 
research, fund raising, propaganda, training, compared 
to wanting to shut it down.

“The authors point to a 2004 Pentagon statement on military doctrine, indicating that the United States 
might respond to a cyberattack with the military use of nuclear weapons in certain cases. “For 
example,” the Pentagon National Military Strategy statement says, “cyberattacks on U.S. 
commercial information systems or attacks against transportation networks may have a greater 
economic or psychological effect than a relatively small release of a lethal agent.” “
