Question: A company argues that using TCP for their live video streaming service is the best choice because it guarantees the correctness of the data packets received. Which of the following would be the best counterargument to this claim?
"A": "TCP is preferred for applications where data needs to be retransmitted until the packets are correctly received, regardless of any time delays this may introduce.",
"B": "While TCP ensures data packet correctness, the indefinite waiting for packet retransmission can lead to unacceptable delays in a live video streaming context.",
"C": "TCP's 3-way handshake adds a level of security which is crucial for protecting the video content from unauthorized access.",
"D": "UDP might cause video quality degradation due to its non-guaranteed delivery, which is not desirable for a premium service."
Answer: B
