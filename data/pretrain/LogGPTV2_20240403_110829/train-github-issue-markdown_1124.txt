**Current behavior**  
Due to script tags being stripped from component templates, there is no way to
implement JSON-LD tags.  
Further discussion on this topic can be found here and #2766
**Expected/desired behavior**  
Using angular-universal and on sites implementing pure client side rendering,
there needs to be a way for users of angular2 to implement JSON-LD tags for
SEO purposes. At the moment this is not possible.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Google recommend JSON-LD for structured data. The alternative of using micro
data is also not a very good idea as this data would be disseminated
throughout the templates of many, if not all components.
