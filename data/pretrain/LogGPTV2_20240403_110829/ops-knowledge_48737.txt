You can use debugging tools, such as GDB, Windbg, etc. to debug the program and gradually locate the problem. 5. Compare data before and after: Compare the data before and after the crash to find data problems. 6. Increase the monitoring and warning mechanism: when troubleshooting, it is necessary to find and deal with the fault in time. Monitoring and warning mechanisms can be added to realize automatic alarms. 7. Coordinating teamwork: Coordinating the internal cooperation of the team, with a clear division of labor, each taking responsibility, and improving work efficiency.
