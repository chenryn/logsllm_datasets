What is the correct process to update typings for the "master" and the
“types-2.0” branch:
This project has a “master” branch, and a “types-2.0” branch.
What is the correct process to make a change to a typings file ?  
1]  
First create the fix as a PR in the “master” branch and then duplicate the
code changes in a new PR on the ”types-2.0″ branch ?
2]  
Or create a PR in the “master” branch and also create a PR on the “types-2.0”
branch which does a merge ?
3]  
Or ?
I could not find this information on the Wiki yet ? Maybe an idea to add
something here about the process?
