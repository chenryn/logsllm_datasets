Another  difference  that  is  not  covered  within  this  paper  is  the 
difference in the time dependent variance of the traffic volume: 
Different QoS classes will have different daily peak hours. As 
an  example  Figure  1  shows  this  difference  in  the  daily  link 
utilization  chart  for  one  backbone  link.  The  time  dependent 
behavior  of  traffic  matrices  is  particularly  important  for  the 
choice  of  the  traffic  matrix  that  is  actually  used  for  traffic 
engineering  or  network  planning:  For  non-best-effort  traffic 
classes  the  traffic  profile  might  follow  business  hours  and  a 
traffic  matrix from a different time interval has to be used for 
network planning or traffic engineering purposes.  
and  equation  (R)  cannot  be  fulfilled  exactly.  We  therefore 
combine parallel links to one link with the sum of the parallel 
links capacities and their average utilization. 
2.2  Integrated Model with QoS class traffic 
In this section we extend (TG) to a system that can be used to 
estimate traffic matrices per QoS class. Unlike in the previous 
section we now assume that the full traffic matrix  *t
 is given. 
In Deutsche Telekom’s IP/MPLS backbone network we use the 
LDP method to obtain  *t
 - other methods as discussed in the 
tunnel 
introduction 
(RSVP-TE 
or  Netflow 
measurements) could also be used. 
If we intend to apply (TG) for different QoS classes, QoS class 
specific link utilizations are a prerequisite. But there may not be 
QoS class specific link utilizations available for all links in the 
network:  For  example  in  case  of  Cisco  routers  QoS-class 
specific link utilizations require the use of the Modular QoS CLI 
(MQC) whose availability depends on the IOS software release 
and the hardware (line card types) in use. For a QoS-class traffic 
matrix estimation method that can be implemented in practice it 
is reasonable to assume 
counters 
•  QoS-class link utilizations are available for a subset of 
all links and 
End-to-End loads are available for the sum of all QoS 
classes 
•

If there are q QoS classes in the network and we denote by 
 the traffic matrix and the link utilization vector for the 
and 
QoS class l (l =1,…,q), and by  Aˆ  the routing matrix reduced to 
subset  of  links  whose  QoS-class  specific  link  utilizations  are 
available, the following set of equation holds analog to (R):

The initial estimate for the QoS class specific traffic matrix  EQt

3.1  Estimation convergence 
Dependent  on the initial estimate vector  EQt
, problem (TGQ) 
may  result  in  negative  values  for  individual  traffic  matrix 
entries. In this case we apply an iterative procedure where the 
negative elements per origin-destination (o-d) relation are set to 
0 and the negative volume is added to the values of the positive 
entries.  After  this  modification,  the  sum  over  the  QoS  classes 
per o-d relation is unchanged and all entries of the traffic matrix 
are non negative. This result is used as a new start vector  EQt
for  the  next  iteration  with  equation  (TGQ).  The  diagram  in 
Figure  3  shows  that  the  iteration  scheme  converges:  The 
percentage of the negative traffic matrix volume is reduced from 
2 % to 0.02 % after only 20 iterations. 
3.2  Estimation accuracy 
For analyzing the estimation accuracy we assume given traffic 
matrix  values  for  all  QoS  classes.  This  given  vector  of  traffic 
matrices is denoted by  *
Qt
. We use a random number generator 
to  set  the  values  in  the  range  between  0  and  100000.  In  a 
simulation,  the  traffic  of  the  four  QoS  classes  is  routed 
according to the IGP metrics of our backbone network. From the 
routed traffic we can then calculate the link utilizations 
 for 
each link k and QoS class l. The traffic matrix  *t
 of the total 
traffic  is  calculated  from  the  sum  over  the  given  QoS  traffic 
matrices.  Finally,  Qt
Qx   as  a 
solution  of  (TGQ)  and  we  calculate  the  relative  error  E  as 
measure for the estimation accuracy.

If we take into consideration all elements of the traffic matrices, 
the mean relative error is dominated by the small elements. As 
the contribution of these elements to the overall traffic volume 
is very small, we focus on the mean relative error Eα of those 
elements  that  are  larger  than  the  (1-α)  quantile  of  the  traffic 
matrix element distribution function.  
Figure 4 we compare Eα from the (TGQ) method (normal lines) 
with results from a tomography model with a start vector from 
the  gravity  model  (TG  model:  dashed  lines,  same  color).  The 
tomography model (TG) is applied to each QoS class separately.  
The  results  show  that  the  mean  relative  error  is  reduced  by  a 
factor  of  2.5  compared  to  results  from  the  (TG)  estimation. 
Nevertheless, a mean relative error in the range between 30 % 
and 100 % indicate that further improvements are needed.
