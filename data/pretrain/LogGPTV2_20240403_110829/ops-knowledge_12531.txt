User: So I installed pydiction into vim for autocompleting my python code in windows. No problemo. Worked like a charm. 
Tried the same thing with my Ubuntu setup, creating the .vim/after/ftplugin directory in my home folder and updating the vimrc with the correct path of the pydiction dictionary but I fail every time. Why is that ? I follow the readme.txt closely , I even found a webpage that describes the process on ubuntu again repeating the same things , nothing. 
Each time I tab after i type "raw" while it worked in windows in ubuntu it reports "Dictionary Completion (^K^N^P) Pattern not Found". Tried other keyword , same problem. Anyone has an idea why this happens ?
Assistant: Sounds like it's having a problem with your complete-dict file. I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 and it works fine for me. Make sure your complete-dict file actually has content in it, in this case make sure it has the word 'raw' in it.
