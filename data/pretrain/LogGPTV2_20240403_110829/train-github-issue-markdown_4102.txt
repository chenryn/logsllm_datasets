### Version
2.6.10
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/mpqx6y8r/2/
### Steps to reproduce
Run the JSFiddle with the browser console open.
A `created` hook on the Vue component will attempt to log to the console the
return value of `this.Pet.getSpecies()` and `this.WaitingList.frontPerson()`.
However, Vue will fail the second call since this array method (class
ExtendArray extends Array) has been stripped during data registration. The
same does not happen with plain Objects (class ExtendObject extends Object).
### What is expected?
Console output:
'Pet: Dog',
'WaitingList: Jack'
### What is actually happening?
Console output:
'Pet: Dog',
'TypeError: this.WaitingList.frontPerson is not a function'
