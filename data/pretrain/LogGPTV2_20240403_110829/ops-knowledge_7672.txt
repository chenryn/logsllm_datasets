User: How can I completely uninstall Anaconda from MacOS Sierra and revert back to the original Python? I have tried using conda-clean -yes but that doesn't work. I also remove the stuff in ~/.bash_profile but it still uses the Anaconda python and I can still run the conda command.
Assistant: This is one more place that anaconda had an entry that was breaking my python install after removing Anaconda. Hoping this helps someone else.
If you are using yarn, I found this entry in my .yarn.rc file in ~/"username"
python "/Users/someone/anaconda3/bin/python3"
removing this line fixed one last place needed for complete removal. I am not sure how that entry was added but it helped
