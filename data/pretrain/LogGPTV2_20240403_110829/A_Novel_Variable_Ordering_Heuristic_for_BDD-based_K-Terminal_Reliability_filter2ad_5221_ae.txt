signiﬁcantly lower |Fmax| than the current state-of-the-art.
Since the decomposition method’s complexity mainly de-
pends on |Fmax|, the application of the new heuristic can
bring enormous improvements in time and space. Particularly,
the strength of the new heuristic is revealed on irregular
structures. There the bfs heuristic often causes comparatively
high |Fmax| rendering any BDD-based reliability method
inefﬁcient. Instead, the new heuristic ﬁnds orderings yielding
signiﬁcantly lower |Fmax| and thus carries along enormous
improvements. Taking into account that each Boolean formula
has a canonical ROBDD representation [22], we can also
expect similar improvements by applying the new heuristic
within other BDD-based approaches. For regular structures
such as grid networks, no signiﬁcant improvements can be
expected with the new heuristic since the bfs heuristic already
generates orderings yielding minimal |Fmax| values. However,
the new heuristic also yields the same |Fmax| values as the
bfs and thus no considerable adverse effects upon performance
occur. These facts are supported by our measurements on both
regular and irregular structures of different scales. Such a
comparison has not yet been found in the literature, as the KLY
and decomposition method were compared based on runtimes
obtained from different computer architectures (see [11], [24]).
Furthermore, no extensive experiments were carried out on
irregular networks such as randomized networks. Hence the
conclusion that the decomposition method generally performs
better than the KLY method is not legitimate. Our results
reveal
the decomposition method is only superior in
regular networks of bounded treewidth Fmax. With regard to
the bfs heuristic, the KLY method performs better on some un-
regular structures. However, when applying the new heuristic
to both the KLY and decomposition method, we can conclude
that with respect to undirected networks, the decomposition
method performs far better than the KLY method.
Thus, our future goal is to extend the generality of the decom-
position method, meaning that it should also be applicable to
directed networks.
According to our current knowledge, no dynamic heuristic
that are applicable to BDD-based reliability analysis brought
mentionable improvements. Hence, another future work is
to investigate existent and conceive new dynamic ordering
strategies for the decomposition method.
