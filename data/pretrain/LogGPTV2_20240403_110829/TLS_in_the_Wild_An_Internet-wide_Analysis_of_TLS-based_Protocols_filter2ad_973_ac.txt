### Data Collection and Analysis

#### Data Collection
During our measurements, the information we save is limited to data from the SSL/TLS handshake, without analyzing any subsequent connection payload. This data collection has been approved by the campus administration. For capability measurements, only automatic server capability replies were recorded, which do not contain any personally identifiable information. Additionally, the University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) considers IP addresses, which were also recorded, as non-personally identifiable.

#### Unusual Traffic on Standard Ports
While analyzing TLS extensions sent by clients, we observed 4,584 connections that included the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension, used for negotiating protocols such as HTTP2 and SPDY. Further examination revealed that 2,703 of these connections, directed to six servers, contained values indicating they were HTTPS servers running on ports 993 and 110. Manual verification showed these to be Squid proxy servers operating on non-standard ports. The remaining 1,881 connections, involving 780 hosts, all had a destination port of 5223. The ALPN values in these cases indicated `apns-security-v1` and `apns-security-v2`, terminating at nodes for the Apple Push Notification Service. We are unsure of the specific software causing these connections. Additionally, our dataset includes 3,728 certificates from 9,082 connections to 110 servers, suggesting their use in the Tor service. These servers were excluded from further analysis.

#### OCSP Stapling
Another interesting finding is the adoption of OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) stapling by email servers. OCSP stapling allows TLS servers to provide proof that their certificate is valid and not revoked, as part of the TLS handshake if the client supports the extension. We identified 836 connections using OCSP stapling, terminating at 64 different servers. The majority (706 connections and 58 servers) were on port 993 (IMAPS).

### Security Analysis

#### Use of STARTTLS vs. Direct SSL/TLS
Email and chat protocols can be secured with SSL/TLS either through dedicated ports or by upgrading a TCP connection via STARTTLS. Table I shows the number of hosts supporting SSL/TLS directly. Table III provides details on STARTTLS support and usage. Our data indicates that, depending on the application-layer protocol, about 30 to 51% of servers offer STARTTLS. While popular servers often support this extension, there is a significant number of servers without it, particularly for SMTP, IMAP, and POP3. In many cases, connections are not upgraded even when the server supports it.

#### SSL/TLS Versionsâ€”Deployment and Use
Ideally, only the latest version of TLS (1.2) should be used, as previous versions, especially SSL 3, have known vulnerabilities. Table IV shows the frequency of different SSL/TLS protocol versions chosen by servers in active scans and observed in passive monitoring. Only 0.03% of scanned servers supported only SSL 3, while the rest preferred stronger TLS versions. However, 1.74% of connections in our passive dataset used SSL 3, suggesting either a preference for less secure servers or outdated clients.

#### Cipher Use
In SSL/TLS, the server selects the symmetric cipher based on a list provided by the client. To determine supported ciphers, multiple connections would be required, which is impractical. Instead, we analyzed passively monitored data to see which ciphers are actually negotiated. 

### Summary of Findings
- **Data Collection**: Limited to SSL/TLS handshake data, approved by campus administration.
- **Unusual Traffic**: Identified non-standard use of ALPN and OCSP stapling.
- **STARTTLS Usage**: Varies by protocol, with significant gaps in actual implementation.
- **SSL/TLS Versions**: Most servers prefer TLS 1.2, but some legacy SSL 3 usage persists.
- **Cipher Use**: Analyzed through passive monitoring to identify commonly negotiated ciphers.

This structured approach provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the data collection, unusual traffic, and security analysis findings.
