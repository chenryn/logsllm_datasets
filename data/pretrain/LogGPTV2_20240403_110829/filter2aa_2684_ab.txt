Homebrew
Homebrew
Homebrew is a term frequently applied only to video games that 
are produced by consumers on proprietary game platforms; in 
other words, game platforms that are not typically user-
programmable, or use proprietary hardware for storage.
Sometimes games developed on official development kits, such 
as Net Yaroze or PS2 Linux are included in the definition. Some, 
however, also refer to all non-commercial, "home-developed" 
games for open architectures as homebrew games, though 
these typically go under more frequently used labels, such as 
freeware.
