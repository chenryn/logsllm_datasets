ABSTRACT
We present ConXsense, the ﬁrst framework for context-
aware access control on mobile devices based on context
classiﬁcation. Previous context-aware access control systems
often require users to laboriously specify detailed policies or
they rely on pre-deﬁned policies not adequately reﬂecting
the true preferences of users. We present the design and
implementation of a context-aware framework that uses a
probabilistic approach to overcome these deﬁciencies. The
framework utilizes context sensing and machine learning to
automatically classify contexts according to their security
and privacy-related properties. We apply the framework
to two important smartphone-related use cases: protection
against device misuse using a dynamic device lock and pro-
tection against sensory malware. We ground our analysis on
a sociological survey examining the perceptions and concerns
of users related to contextual smartphone security and ana-
lyze the eﬀectiveness of our approach with real-world context
data. We also demonstrate the integration of our framework
with the FlaskDroid [7] architecture for ﬁne-grained access
control enforcement on the Android platform.

that make use of this information are becoming increasingly
popular. Examples include location-based applications like
Foursquare and Tencent WeChat, augmented reality appli-
cations like Layar, Wikitude, Google Goggles and HERE City
Lens among many more. Even mainstream applications like
social network apps support context-based enhancements.
The improved sensing capabilities of modern smart de-
vices also provide an attractive attack surface against the
contextual privacy of users, as the recent development of
sensory malware shows: malicious code, typically a Trojan
Horse appearing to be a legitimate app, uses the sensors
of the device to extract sensitive information from the sur-
roundings of the user. Context-aware access control can be
used to encounter this threat by limiting the access of un-
trusted 3rd-party applications to context information.
Various context-aware access control mechanisms and sys-
tems have been proposed. Some of these works are based on
modiﬁcations of the RBAC model [12, 13] in which context-
awareness is realized through roles that are triggered based
on context parameters. Other approaches use explicit poli-
cies conditioned on contextual parameters [33, 2, 11, 5] or
rules for expressing higher-level contextual preferences [21].
All of these works are based on user-deﬁned or pre-deﬁned
policies. User-deﬁned policies are very laborious to set up
and maintain. This can be encountered with pre-deﬁned
policies provided by system administrators or app vendors,
but these are inaccurate and inﬂexible: they cannot ade-
quately capture and adapt to the highly personal and dy-
namic nature of individual users’ contexts and privacy pref-
erences. In our work, we overcome these deﬁciencies by using
automatic context classiﬁcation as a basis for access control
decisions instead of static access control policies.
Furthermore, improved sensing capabilities also provide
better possibilities to encounter threats arising from the con-
text, like the threat of physical device misuse. Current static
device locking methods severely deteriorate device usability
with unnecessary password prompts in low-risk contexts,
causing many users to leave their device unprotected [38].
Some earlier works attempted to improve device locking by
using context information to probabilistically determine a
level of conﬁdence in the user’s authenticity [31, 19]. We
take a diﬀerent approach: we do not try to authenticate
users, but adjust device locking criteria according to the
perceived security risk level of a context.
293To ground our work we use an interdisciplinary approach
in which a sociological study is used to identify the concerns
and perceptions of smartphone users in diﬀerent contexts.
Contributions. Our contributions are as follows:
• We introduce ConXsense, the ﬁrst context-aware ac-
cess control framework for smartphones that uses con-
text proﬁling and automatic, adaptive and per-
sonalized context classiﬁcation for making con-
text-aware access control decisions.
• We apply our framework to two important smartphone
use cases: protecting against device misuse, and
defending against sensory malware. ConXsense,
however, is also applicable to a wide range of other
security and privacy-related use cases.
• We apply context proﬁling and machine learning
techniques on real-world data collected in a user study
and evaluate the eﬃciency of automatic context clas-
siﬁcation in addressing the aforementioned threats.
• We integrate ConXsense with the FlaskDroid [7] ar-
chitecture for ﬁne-grained access control enforcement
on the Android platform in order to realize the ﬁrst
adaptive, personalized and context-aware access con-
trol system of its kind for mobile devices.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. A descrip-
tion of the problem and the ConXsense framework is given
in Sections 2 and 3. In Section 4 we introduce the results of
a sociological study on users’ concerns and perceptions re-
lated to smartphones and present use cases addressing these
concerns in Section 5. The design and implementation of our
context model are described in Sections 6 and 7. The results
of a user study evaluating the performance of context clas-
siﬁcation are presented in Section 8, and Section 9 shows its
integration with the FlaskDroid architecture. After summa-
rizing related work in Section 10, we conclude with outlines
of future work in Section 11.
2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
While the idea of context-aware access control is not new
[12, 21, 13, 11], currently proposed solutions mostly rely on
policies specifying access control rules conditioned on values
of contextual parameters.
User-speciﬁed policies have the potential to correctly re-
ﬂect the user’s true security and privacy preferences, but
the amount of work required to set up and maintain a com-
prehensive set of context-dependent policies is high. Av-
erage users of mobile devices are hardly willing to spend
signiﬁcant amounts of time maintaining their policy set. In
addition, it is questionable, whether regular users are capa-
ble to fully understand the implications of the policy set-
tings they deﬁne. A study concerning location sharing poli-
cies [33] showed that the initial accuracy of location disclo-
sure rules speciﬁed by users was only 59% and improved
to 65% after users modiﬁed the rules based on a review of
concrete enforcement decisions resulting from these rules. A
recent study on the users’ willingness to share their data
with prominent single-sign on services [3] showed that the
majority of users did not correctly understand the sharing
implications of a sign-on dialog directly presented to them.
These results suggest that the users’ practical ability to con-
trol their security and privacy settings is limited.

ConXsense
An approach to tackle this problem of complexity and
required user eﬀort is to simplify things for users by pre-
deﬁned policies provided by administrators or app vendors.
While this eﬀectively reduces the user’s burden, it fails to ad-
dress the individual needs and privacy preferences of users.
Pre-deﬁned policies are by necessity only generalizations and
not capable of accurately capturing concrete contexts and
situations in individual users’ lives. Also the fact that the
privacy preferences of users may vary signiﬁcantly from per-
son to person can be very diﬃcult to address using pre-
deﬁned policies.
It seems also unlikely that the privacy and security impli-
cations of pre-deﬁned policies would be fully understood by
regular users. This may lead to undesired situations: users
under- or overestimating the level of privacy and security
protection that the pre-deﬁned policy provides to them.
User- or pre-deﬁned policies alone are not suﬃcient to
capture the highly dynamic and highly personal nature of
a user’s context (i.e., the ambient environment the device
ﬁnds itself in) due to the problems outlined above. We aim
at encountering these deﬁciencies by designing a context-
aware access control framework that captures and adapts to
the user’s perception of the context and performs automatic
context classiﬁcation for making ﬁne-grained context-aware
access control decisions without the need for users to explic-
itly deﬁne contextual constraints. In the following section
we describe the ConXsense framework in more detail.
3. FRAMEWORK DESCRIPTION
The ConXsense framework provides context-aware access
control decisions by performing automatic classiﬁcation of
the context with regard to its security-relevant properties.
The classiﬁcation is based on machine learning models and
user feedback providing ground truth information for train-
ing these models. Figure 1 shows a high-level overview of
the framework.
The framework architecture is driven by context data ob-
served with the sensors of the mobile device. The data are
fed to a Proﬁler to calculate features describing the context.
The Proﬁler implements a context model and aggregates pro-
ﬁles for relevant objects (e.g., signiﬁcant places of the user
PolicyEnforcementDynamic ContextClassificationProfilerMobile Device ContextAccess ControlLayerContextDataClassification +ConfidenceValueApplicationAccess RequestAccess DecisionUser feedbackSystem APIGround Truth DataContextFeaturesClassifierEnforcement Model294or devices the user encounters) in the model. The Proﬁler
evaluates incoming observations based on the proﬁles and
the context model, and periodically calculates feature vec-
tors characterizing the current context of the user.
Apart from sensed context data, the framework obtains
input through user feedback. This feedback can be derived
from explicit user interaction (e.g., feedback given through
the device’s UI) or by monitoring the user’s actions.
The Classiﬁer uses the context feature vectors and user
feedback events to train and update the context classiﬁca-
tion models. Once the models have been trained, they are
used to classify new observations with regard to the context’s
security and privacy-relevant properties. The classiﬁcation
estimate of the Classiﬁer and its associated conﬁdence value
are forwarded to the Access Control Layer, which takes them
into account when making access control decisions. The
framework can be used to address any use case for which
contextual factors play a role, and it can accommodate any
sensors, resources, functionalities, communication links or
other data objects for which the Access Control Layer pro-
vides enforcement support.
In the following, we instantiate the ConXsense framework
for protecting the privacy of the user. We consider two cen-
tral use cases we identiﬁed and demonstrate the applicabil-
ity and eﬀectiveness of our approach by evaluating it with
real-world contextual data obtained from a user study.
4. USER SURVEY
To investigate smartphone users’ perceptions and con-
cerns with regard to their smartphones in diﬀerent contexts,
we conducted a user survey following a Mixed Methods [40]
approach commonly applied in sociological studies. We de-
signed a statistical-quantitative survey [41] using quantita-
tive questions to identify facts by statistical analysis [1] com-
bined with open-ended, qualitative questions for investigat-
ing the underlying reasons for the users’ perceptions.
The survey was answered by 122 participants aged 18-56
including people from diﬀerent household types and repre-
senting diﬀerent organizational positions. The participants
were recruited using word-of-mouth, electronic communica-
tions like e-mail and social networks, targeting particularly
smartphone users, to obtain a cross-sectional sample of dif-
ferent age groups and backgrounds. Thus, the set of respon-
dents in our sample is representative of the target group of
our framework, namely active smartphone users.
The survey contained questions on which contexts and
contextual factors users deem relevant for their perceptions
of contextual privacy and security. The answers to the open-
ended questions conﬁrmed our initial assumptions that two
major context-related concerns dominate the users’ minds.
Firstly, people are concerned about device misuse, i.e., that
their device is stolen and/or misused without their knowl-
edge. The second concern relates to privacy exposure: users
fear that private or conﬁdential context information related
to their life is revealed to unauthorized parties.
In some earlier studies on contextual behavior patterns of
mobile device users, two central contexts have been used:
“home” and “work” [43]. Also lifetime studies in social sci-
ences suggest that these contexts are the most important
contexts in average users’ lives [37]. Therefore, we included
dedicated questions about these context types as prototypes
of very familiar contexts. Tables 1 and 2 show the results.
