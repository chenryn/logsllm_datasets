## üìù Provide a description of the new feature
I am a big fan of PowerToys, especially Fancy Zones. I love that feature, but
sometimes I have to turn off Fancy Zones and go back to resizing my windows
using the default Window+Arrow Keys because that way Windows adds a splitter
in between the two windows and I can easily resize them.
_What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the scenario
this would be used?_
When the window is in the zone and gets resized horizontally or vertically,
also resize the adjacent window. I am guessing this should be fairly
straightforward to implement since the feature already exists in Windows 10
(or maybe even earlier versions) when we have 2 windows snapped, one on the
left and the other on the right.

Please, please add this feature.
