In my previous text editor, I was able to select a piece of text or code, and all other occurrences of that selection would be highlighted within the view. From there, I could quickly navigate to each occurrence using a simple shortcut. The editor would place the selection into a finder, allowing me to jump between the results seamlessly.

It would be fantastic to have this feature in Atom as well.
