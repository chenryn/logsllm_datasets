User: As a network security engineer, you need to do security testing on the company's network to ensure its security. Please provide a plan for network penetration testing.
Assistant: The following is a plan for a network penetration test: 1. Determine the scope of the test: determine the scope of the test network, computers and applications, and list the goals of the test. 2. Collect intelligence: use various tools and means to collect information on the network and the target, and understand the target domain name, IP address, network topology, system, and common vulnerabilities. 3. Vulnerability scanning: select an appropriate vulnerability scanning tool to scan the hosts in the network, find vulnerabilities and list important vulnerabilities. 4. Authentication: Test the strength of user and administrator logins, authentication, and access controls, test password policies, password complexity, and password generation. 5. Malware Attacks: Use malware analysis to test the security of networks and systems, and to check the effectiveness of antivirus software, intrusion detection, and other protective measures. 6. Social engineering: Attempt to test employee security awareness and vigilance using username and password reset techniques or the art of guessing passwords. 7. Application attack: Test the actual vulnerabilities of web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities. 8. Assess exploitability of vulnerabilities: Evaluate discovered vulnerabilities to determine their potential for exploitation, including aspects such as credibility, complexity, and impact. 9. Identify fixes: List all discovered vulnerabilities and propose fixes. 10. Writing reports: Write detailed penetration testing reports and include detailed remediation measures so that administrators can repair security vulnerabilities in real time. 11. Maintain Penetration Tests: Penetration tests are regularly maintained and repeated as needed to ensure continued security of the network and systems.
