test [36]. The standard Turing tester communicates with an un-
known subject for ﬁve minutes, and decides whether it is a human
or machine. Classifying Twitter users is actually more challenging
than it appears to be. For many users, their tweets are less likely to
form a relatively consistent context. For example, a series of suc-
cessive tweets may be hardly relevant. The ﬁrst tweet is the user
status, like “watching a football game with my buds.” The second
tweet is an automatic update from his blog. The third tweet is a
news report RSS feed in the format of article title followed by a
shortened URL.
For every account, the following classiﬁcation procedure is ex-
ecuted. We thoroughly observe the log, and visit the user’s home-
page (http://twitter.com/username) if necessary. We carefully check
tweet contents, visit URLs included in tweets (if any), and decide
if redirected web pages are related with their original tweets and
if they contain spam or malicious contents. We also check other
properties, like tweeting devices, user proﬁle, and the numbers of
followers and friends. Given a long sequence of tweets (usually
we check 60 or more if needed), the user is labeled as a human if
we can obtain some evidence of original, intelligent, speciﬁc and
human-like contents. In particular, a human user usually records
what he is doing or how he feels about something on Twitter, as he
uses Twitter as a micro-blogging tool to display himself and inter-
44,431,923 tweets in the training set, and 3,918,172 tweets in the
test set.
act with friends. For example, he may write a post like “I just saw
Yankees lost again today. I think they have to replace the starting
pitcher for tomorrow’s game." The content carries intelligence and
originality. Speciﬁcity means that the tweet content is expressed
in relatively unambiguous words with the presence of conscious-
ness [36]. For instance, in reply to a tweet like “How you like
iPad?", a speciﬁc response made by human may be “I like its large
touch screen and embedded 3G network”. On the other hand, a
generic reply could be “I like it".
The criteria for identifying a bot are listed as follows. The ﬁrst is
the lack of intelligent or original content. For example, completely
retweeting tweets of others or posting adages indicates a lack of
originality. The second is the excessive automation of tweeting,
like automatic updates of blog entries or RSS feeds. The third is
the abundant presence of spam or malicious URLs (i.e., phishing
or malware) in tweets or the user proﬁle. The fourth is repeatedly
posting duplicate tweets. The ﬁfth is posting links with unrelated
tweets. For example, the topic of the redirected web page does not
match the tweet description. The last is the aggressive following
behavior. In order to gain attention from human users, bots do mass
following and un-following within a short period of time. Cyborgs
are either human-assisted bots or bot-assisted humans. The crite-
rion for classifying a cyborg is the evidence of both human and bot
participation. For example, a typical cyborg account may contain
very different types of tweets. A large proportion of tweets carry
contents of human-like intelligence and originality, while the rest
are automatic updates of RSS feeds. It represents a usage model,
in which the human uses his account from time to time while the
Twitter widget constantly runs on his desktop and posts RSS feeds
of his favorite news channel. Lastly, the uncertain category is for
non-English users and those without enough tweets to classify. The
samples that are difﬁcult and uncertain to classify fall into this cate-
gory, and are discarded. Some Twitter accounts are set as "private"
for privacy protection, and their web pages are only visible to their
friends. We do not include such type of users in the classiﬁcation
either, because of their inaccessibility.
3.3 Data Analysis
As mentioned before, Twitter API functions support detailed user
information query, ranging from proﬁle, follower and friend lists to
posted tweets. In the above crawl, for each user visited, we call API
functions to collect abundant information related with user classi-
ﬁcation. Most information is returned in the format of XML or
JSON. We develop some toolkits to extract useful information from
the above well-organized data structures. Our measurement results
are presented in the question-answer format.
Q1. Does automation generate more tweets? To answer Ques-
tion 1, we measure the number of tweets posted in a user’s life-
time 5. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the tweet counts, corresponding to the human, bot and cyborg
category. It is clear that cyborg posts more tweets than human and
bot. A large proportion of cyborg accounts are registered by com-
mercial companies and websites as a new type of media channel
and customer service. Most tweets are posted by automated tools
(i.e., RSS feed widgets, Web 2.0 integrators), and the volume of
such tweets is considerable. Meanwhile, those accounts are usu-
ally maintained by some employees who communicate with cus-
tomers from time to time. Thus, the high tweet count in the cyborg
category is attributed to the combination of both automatic and hu-
man behaviors in a cyborg. It is surprising that bot generates fewer
tweets than human. We check the bot accounts, and ﬁnd out the
following fact. In its active period, bot tweets more frequently than
human. However, bots tend to take long-term hibernation. Some
are either suspended by Twitter due to extreme or aggressive activi-
ties, while the others are in incubation and can be activated to form
bot legions.
Q2. Do bots have more friends than followers? A user’s tweets
can only be delivered to those who follow him. A common strategy
shared by bots is following a large number of users (either targeted
with purpose or randomly chosen), and expecting some of them
will follow back. Figure 2 shows the scatter plots of the numbers
5It is the duration from the time when his account was created to
the time when our crawler visited it.

Followers / Friends
Figure 3: CDF of ratio of Followers over Friends
of followers and friends for the three categories. For better illus-
tration, the scale is chopped and a small amount of extraordinary
points are not included. In Figure 2, there are three different groups
of users: group I where the number of one’s followers is clearly
greater than the number of its friends; group II where the situation
is reverse; and group III where the nodes stick around the diagonal.
In the human category, as shown in Figure 2(a), the majority of
the nodes belong to group III, implying that the number of their
followers is close to that of their friends. This result complies with
[27], revealing that human relationships are typically reciprocal in
social networks. Meanwhile, there are quite a few nodes belonging
to group I with far more followers than friends. They are usually
accounts of celebrities and famous organizations. They generate
interesting media contents and attract numerous subscribers. For
example, the singer Justin Timberlake has 1,645,675 followers and
39 friends (the ratio is 42,197-to-1).
In the bot category, many nodes belong to group II, as shown in
Figure 2(b). Bots add many users as friends, but few follow them
back. Unsolicited tweets make bots unpopular among the human
world. However, for some bots, the number of their followers is
close to that of their friends. This is due to the following reason.
Twitter imposes a limit on the ratio of followers over friends to sup-
press bots. Thus, some more advanced bots unfollow their friends
if they do not follow back within a certain amount of time. Those
bots cunningly keep the ratio close to 1. Figure 3 shows the ratio
of followers over friends for the three categories. The human ratio
is the highest, whereas the bot ratio is the lowest.
Q3. Are there any other temporal properties of Twitter users
helpful for differentiation among human, bot, and cyborg? Many
research works like [11] and [9] have shown the weekly and diurnal
access patterns of humans in the Internet. Figures 4(a) and 4(b)
present the tweeting percentages of the three different categories
on daily and hourly bases, respectively. The weekly behavior of
Twitter users shows clear differences among the three categories.
While humans are more active during the regular workdays, from
Monday to Friday, and less active during the weekend, Saturday
and Sunday, bots have roughly the same activity level every day
of the week.
Interestingly, cyborgs are the most active ones on
Monday and then slowly decrease their tweeting activities during
the week; on Saturday cyborgs reach their lowest active point but
somehow bounce back a bit on Sunday. Such a cyborg activity
trend is mainly caused by their message feeds and the high level of
news and blog activities at the start of a week. Similarly, the hourly
behavior of human is more active during the daytime, which mostly
overlaps with ofﬁce hours. The bot activity is nearly even except a
little drop in the deep of night. Some more advanced bots have the
setting of “only tweet from a time point to another,” which helps
save API calls [37]. Thus, they can tweet more in the daytime to
better draw the attention of humans.
Figure 5 shows account registration dates grouped by quarter.
We have two observations from the ﬁgure. First, the majority of
accounts (80.0% of humans, 94.8% of bots, and 71.1% of cyborgs)
were registered in 2009. It conﬁrms the dramatic growth of Twitter
in 2009. Second, we do not ﬁnd any bot or cyborg in our ground
truth dataset earlier than March, 2007. However, human registra-
tion has continued increasing since Twitter was founded in 2006.
Thus, old accounts are less likely to be bots.
Q4. How do users post tweets? manually or via auto piloted
tools? Twitter supports a variety of channels to post tweets. The
device name appears below a tweet preﬁxed by “from.” Our whole
dataset includes 41,991,545 tweets posted by 3,648 distinct de-
vices. The devices can be roughly divided into the following four
categories. (1) Web, a user logs into Twitter and posts tweets via the
website. (2) Mobile devices, there are some programs exclusively
running on mobile devices to post tweets, like Txt for text mes-
sages, Mobile web for web browsers on handheld devices, Twit-
terBerry for BlackBerry, and twidroid for Android mobile OS. (3)
Registered third-party applications, many third-parties have devel-
oped their own applications using Twitter APIs to tweet, and reg-
istered them with Twitter. From the application standpoint, we
can further categorize this group into sub groups including website
integrators (twitpic, bit.ly, Facebook), browser extensions (Tweet-
bar and Twitterfox for Firefox), desktop clients (TweetDeck and
Seesmic Desktop), and RSS feeds/blog widgets (twitterfeed and
Twitter for Wordpress). (4) APIs, for those third-party applications
not registered or certiﬁcated by Twitter, they appear as “API" in
Twitter.
Figure 6 shows the makeup of the above tweeting device cat-
egories. Among them, the website of Twitter is the most widely
used and generates nearly half of the tweets (46.78%), followed
by third-party devices (40.18%). Mobile devices and unregistered
API tools contribute 6.81% and 6.23%, respectively. Table 1 lists
the top ten devices used by the human, bot, and cyborg categories,
and the whole dataset6.
More than half of the human tweets are manually posted via
6The whole dataset contains around 500,000 users, and the human,
bot and cyborg categories equally contain 1,000 users in the train-
ing dataset.
