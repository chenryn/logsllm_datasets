**ATT&CK ID:** M1047  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Audit

Administrators should conduct a comprehensive audit of all access lists and the permissions granted for web applications and services. This initial audit should cover all resources to establish a baseline. Subsequently, periodic audits should be performed on new or updated resources to ensure ongoing security. Any suspicious accounts or credentials identified during these audits should be thoroughly investigated and, if necessary, removed.

To enhance security, enable advanced auditing on ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services). Specifically, check and configure the success and failure audit options in the ADFS Management snap-in. Additionally, enable the "Audit Application Generated" events on the AD FS farm via Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to monitor and log relevant activities.
