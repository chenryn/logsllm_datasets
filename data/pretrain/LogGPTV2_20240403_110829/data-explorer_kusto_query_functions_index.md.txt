# Function Types

Functions in Kusto are reusable queries or query parts. Kusto supports two main types of functions:

1. **Built-in Functions**: These are hard-coded functions defined by Kusto and cannot be modified by users.

2. **User-Defined Functions**: These are created and managed by users and are divided into two subtypes:
   - **Stored Functions**: These are user-defined functions that are stored and managed as database schema entities, similar to tables. For more information, see [Stored Functions](../../query/schema-entities/stored-functions.md). To create a stored function, use the [.create function command](../../management/create-function.md).
   - **Query-Defined Functions**: These are user-defined functions that are defined and used within the scope of a single query. The definition of such functions is done using a `let` statement. For more information on how to create query-defined functions, see [Create a User-Defined Function](../let-statement.md#create-a-user-defined-function-with-scalar-calculation).

For more detailed information on user-defined functions, refer to [User-Defined Functions](./user-defined-functions.md).
