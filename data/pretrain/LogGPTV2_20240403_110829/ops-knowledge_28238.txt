User: How to use Ansible to manage and automate server configuration? Provides a basic Playbook example.
Assistant: Ansible is an automation tool that helps administrators manage and deploy server configurations quickly and easily. Here is a basic example Playbook to install Nginx and create a simple web page: ``` --- name: Install and configure Nginx hosts: web-servers become: yes tasks: - name: Install Nginx apt: name : nginx state: present - name: Start Nginx service service: name: nginx state: started - name: Create webpage copy: dest: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html content: "<html><body>< h1>Welcome to my page!</h1></body></html>" ``` In this Playbook example, there are three tasks: 1. Install Nginx 2. Start Nginx service 3. Create a simple web page in Before the task, we declared that this Playbook will run in the "web-servers" host group, and use sudo privileges when executing the task. Now we can run this Playbook with the following command: ``` ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml ``` This command will automatically connect to each host in the web-servers group and execute the task. After that, we can visit the IP address of the host in the browser and see a simple welcome page. It's worth noting that this playbook example is very basic and only demonstrates some of Ansible's capabilities. In practical applications, the tasks and variables in the Playbook will be more complex and detailed in order to automate more tasks.
