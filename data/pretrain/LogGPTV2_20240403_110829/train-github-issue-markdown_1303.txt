I'm experiencing an issue where running the `npm config get prefix` command causes a delay of about 1-2 seconds. I am using [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage my Node.js versions, and nvm internally uses this `npm` command whenever a new bash shell is opened. 

Could anyone confirm if they are also encountering a similar delay, or suggest any potential solutions?
