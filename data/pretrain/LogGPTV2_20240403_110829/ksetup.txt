ksetup
Performs tasks related to setting up and maintaining Kerberos protocol and the Key Distribution Center (KDC) to support Kerberos realms. Specifically, this command is used to:
Change the computer settings for locating Kerberos realms. In non-Microsoft, Kerberosâ€“based implementations, this information is usually kept in the Krb5.conf file. In Windows Server operating systems, it's kept in the registry. You can use this tool to modify these settings. These settings are used by workstations to locate Kerberos realms and by domain controllers to locate Kerberos realms for cross-realm trust relationships.
Initialize registry keys that the Kerberos Security Support Provider (SSP) uses to locate a KDC for the Kerberos realm, if the computer is isn't a member of a Windows domain. After configuration, the user of a client computer running the Windows operating system can log on to accounts in the Kerberos realm.
Search the registry for the domain name of the user's realm and then resolves the name to an IP address by querying a DNS server. The Kerberos protocol can use DNS to locate KDCs by using only the realm name, but it must be specially configured to do so.
