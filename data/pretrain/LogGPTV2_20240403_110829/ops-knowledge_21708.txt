User: I have a git folder with several ipython notebook files in it. I've just got a new comp and installed ipython. When I open some files, it works fine, others, however, display this error:
Error loading notebook, bad request.
The log looks like:
2014-07-16 00:20:11.523 [NotebookApp] WARNING | Unreadable Notebook: /nas-6000/wclab/Ahmed/Notebook/01 - Boundary Layer.ipynb [Errno 5] Input/output error
WARNING:tornado.access:400 GET /api/notebooks/01%20-%20Boundary%20Layer.ipynb?_=1405434011080 (127.0.0.1) 3.00ms referer=linktofile
The read/write and owner permissions are the same for each of the files. The files open fine on my other computers, it's just this new one. Any ideas?
Cheers,
James
Assistant: Errno 5 is a low level error usually reported when your disk has bad sectors.
I don't think the error is related to the file or ipython, check your disk with an appropriate tool (fsck if you are using Linux).
