Subject: Issue with Opening IPython Notebooks on New Computer

Dear Support,

I recently set up a new computer and installed IPython. I have a Git repository containing several IPython notebook files. While some of these files open without any issues, others display the following error:

```
Error loading notebook, bad request.
```

The log provides the following details:

```
2014-07-16 00:20:11.523 [NotebookApp] WARNING | Unreadable Notebook: /nas-6000/wclab/Ahmed/Notebook/01 - Boundary Layer.ipynb [Errno 5] Input/output error
WARNING:tornado.access:400 GET /api/notebooks/01%20-%20Boundary%20Layer.ipynb?_=1405434011080 (127.0.0.1) 3.00ms referer=linktofile
```

The read/write and owner permissions are consistent across all the files. These files open without any problems on my other computers, so the issue seems to be specific to this new setup.

Could you provide any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this?

Best regards,
James

**Response:**

Hi James,

Thank you for reaching out. The `Errno 5` is typically associated with low-level input/output errors, which can indicate issues with the disk, such as bad sectors.

Given that the problem is specific to your new computer and the files work fine on other machines, it's likely that the issue is related to the storage device on your new setup. Here are a few steps you can take to diagnose and potentially resolve the problem:

1. **Check Disk Health:**
   - If you are using Linux, you can use the `fsck` tool to check and repair file system errors. For example:
     ```sh
     sudo fsck /dev/sdXn
     ```
     Replace `/dev/sdXn` with the appropriate device identifier for your disk partition.
   - On Windows, you can use the `chkdsk` utility. Open Command Prompt as an administrator and run:
     ```sh
     chkdsk C: /f /r
     ```
     Replace `C:` with the drive letter of the affected partition.

2. **Verify File Integrity:**
   - Ensure that the files were copied correctly to the new computer. You can compare the file sizes and checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA256) between the original and copied files to verify their integrity.

3. **Check for Hardware Issues:**
   - If the disk check does not resolve the issue, there might be a hardware problem with the storage device. Consider running a SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) test to check the health of your hard drive or SSD.

4. **Update Software:**
   - Ensure that your IPython and Jupyter Notebook installations are up to date. You can update them using pip:
     ```sh
     pip install --upgrade ipython jupyter
     ```

If the issue persists after trying these steps, please let me know, and we can explore further troubleshooting options.
