User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx doesn't start using systemctl I have defined a custom error_log for a virtual server inside it's directory like so:

server {
        listen 80;
        server_name www.example.com;
        root   /home/www.example.com;
        error_log /home/www.example.com/error.log;
}


this is my nginx.conf:

user  nginx;
pid  /run/nginx.pid;
worker_processes  1;


Nginx starts as root with it's commands with no problems:

nginx -t
nginx 


But when I try to start it using systemctl it won't start and status shows this:

nginx: [emerg] open() "/home/www.example.com/error.log" failed (13: Permission denied)


This is my nginx.service :

[Unit]
Description=The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
After=syslog.target network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/run/nginx.pid
ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t

I have almost tried anything like changing the user:group of the web directory to nginx:nginx. Even if I remove the error_log it starts using systemctl but it can't access the web directory although it's running under the same user.

I can't figure out why nginx can't access that directory when it's started with systemctl while it has access when it's started directly.

I'm on centos 7.

Assistant: SELinux is probably not allowing nginx to access the/home directory. Try changing the root to /var/www as a test. Also when you are starting up nginx run journalctl -x in a different session to see the error messages and post them here.
