User: Python for Windows by default comes with IDLE, which is the barest-bones IDE I've ever encountered.  For editing files, I'll stick to emacs, thank you very much.
However, I want to run programs in some other shell than the crappy windows command prompt, which can't be widened to more than 80 characters.  
IDLE lets me run programs in it if I open the file, then hit F5 (to go Run-> Run Module).    I would rather like to just "run" the command, rather than going through the rigmarole of closing the emacs file, loading the IDLE file, etc.  A scan of google and the IDLE docs doesn't seem to give much help about using IDLE's shell but not it's IDE.  
Any advice from the stack overflow guys?  Ideally I'd either like

advice on running programs using IDLE's shell
advice on other ways to run python programs in windows outside of IDLE or "cmd".

Thanks,

Click on the system box (top-left) in the command prompt and click properties. In the layout tab you can set the width and height of the window and the width and height of the screen buffer. I recommend setting the screen buffer height to 9999 so you can scroll back through a long output.
