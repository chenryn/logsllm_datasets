4.3 Unlabeled MPLS Path Estimation
Finally, we examine the performance on prior Ark data that does
not have MPLS labels. We train our classiﬁer using a subset of la-
beled June 2008 Ark data, and then test on the prior months (March,
April, and May 2008) for which we have no ground truth. We
present our results with respect to the four most frequently encoun-
tered ASes in our training set. In Table 3, we ﬁnd the results of
our MPLS path detection in terms of the percentage of observed
paths for a given autonomous system that we estimate to include an
MPLS tunnel. The table shows the percentage of inferred MPLS
tunnels as gross characteristics consistent with the labeled June
2008 data. The level of variability in our inference is consistent
with the variability that we see in the labeled MPLS data.
While our pre-June 2008 data does not contain uniform-mode
MPLS labels, we do have the ability to examine paths that are found
in both unlabeled pre-June 2008 data and labeled June 2008 data.
Using the June 2008 MPLS labels as ground truth, we can examine
performance of our inference methodology on an intersection of
these two sets. Figure 19 shows the performance of our inference
technique on unlabeled Ark data from March, April, and May 2008.
As expected, the classiﬁer performance is more accurate for time
frames closer to the labeled set (i.e., May dataset), when compared
with the more temporally distant unlabeled set (i.e., March dataset).

5. RELATED WORK
The literature on MPLS largely falls into three categories. The
ﬁrst are studies that describe methods for expanding and enhancing
MPLS beyond the original RFCs describing the protocol. Exam-
ples include methods for improving reliability and fault tolerance
(e.g., [15, 25]) and extension for a wide range of label switched
paths including photonic networks (i.e., GMPLS [11]) and wireless
networks (e.g., [23]). The second category are studies that describe
methods for employing MPLS to meet various operational objec-
tives within a given network infrastructure. The most prominent
among these are studies that describe a wide variety of trafﬁc en-
gineering methods based on MPLS (e.g., [17, 37]).
In the third
category are studies describing new routing algorithms that can be
used in conjunction with MPLS to establish paths with target char-
acteristics (e.g., [35]).
Details of the MPLS protocol are described in various RFCs
which are all linked from the IETF’s MPLS working group home-
page [3]. The main MPLS architectural reference is RFC 3031 [31],
and the most relevant standards document to our study is RFC
4950, which deﬁnes the ICMP extensions that enable label stacks
to be returned to clients [12]. Beyond RFC documents, Davie and
Rekhter wrote a comprehensive textbook reference on MPLS that
broadly treats the protocol [16]. There are also numerous online
references and notes on practical aspects of MPLS conﬁguration
and management (e.g., [34])
We are aware of no prior studies on Internet-wide MPLS deploy-
ment characteristics. Perhaps the most relevant empirical studies
were by Sherwood et al. in [32, 33]. The former study describes
a method for measuring router-level topologies that includes the
capability to discover MPLS nodes using ICMP extensions. That
study provides a small set of measurements on routers that respond
with MPLS labels. The latter study also discusses certain aspects
of MPLS, again in the context of router-level topology discovery.
Our study differs from theirs in its speciﬁc focus on MPLS and the
longitudinal characterization of its deployment.
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
MPLS offers compelling capabilities for trafﬁc engineering,
multi-services networks and improved network robustness. In this
paper, we describe a longitudinal study of the prevalence and char-
acteristics of MPLS deployments in the open Internet. The goal of
our work is to establish a comprehensive baseline for the evolution
and current status of MPLS deployments since they have important
implications for issues such as quality of service and network neu-
trality. We use the large traceroute archive from the Ark project
as the basis for our work. Over the past 3 years, this data set has in-
cluded MPLS label stacks, which enable direct evaluation of MPLS
tunnels conﬁgured in uniform mode. We note again that our direct
observations likely underestimate MPLS deployments due to the
inability to empirically identify pipe-mode tunnels.

Figure 19: Comparison of the MPLS path detection of unlabeled data using June 2008 labels. (Left) - March 2008 Ark Dataset,

The summary ﬁndings of our analysis show an increasing trend
in MPLS deployments over the past three years and the wide use
by tier-1 providers, implying that it is increasingly likely that pack-
ets will encounter an MPLS tunnel on end-to-end paths. We also
ﬁnd that tunnels are likely to span the entire edge-to-edge distance
of a transit provider, with typical transit times on the order of tens
of milliseconds. Lastly, our examination of the use of trafﬁc clas-
siﬁers indicates that while multiple classes are not uncommon, the
diversity of classes has not changed over the past three years.
We develop an MPLS tunnel inference method that is based on
the observation that for certain conﬁgurations, RTTs for internal
hops will all be similar. Our inference method uses Bayesian data
fusion to efﬁciently identify MPLS paths based on RTTs. Using the
labeled data, we demonstrate that this method can indeed identify
MPLS paths with high accuracy.
In future work, we plan to investigate MPLS deployments in ad-
ditional traceroute data archives using our Bayesian inference
method. A short term target is the Skitter data set, which would
give us the opportunity to investigate MPLS deployments over a
longer time period. We also plan to expand our survey by con-
ducting more targeted investigations using distributed infrastruc-
tures such as Planetlab.
