### Agencies and Network Traffic Interception

Agencies generally do not adequately address the interception of network traffic by other organizations.

### What Constitutes a Private Communication?

For the purposes of criminal or anti-terrorism law, what defines a private communication, especially those transmitted over a network? The only explicit definition found in the selected legislation is in the Criminal Code of Canada. According to the Code, a private communication is defined as "any oral communication or telecommunication that is made under circumstances in which it is reasonable for the originator to expect that it will not be intercepted by any person other than the intended recipient." Telecommunications are further defined as "the emission, transmission, or reception of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, or intelligence of any nature by any wire, cable, radio, optical, or other electromagnetic system, or by any similar technical system." Although not explicitly mentioned, network communications would almost certainly fall within this definition. It is the expectation of the originator that no one other than the intended recipient will intercept the message that determines whether the communication is considered private.

### Distinguishing Between Public and Private Personal Information

It is useful to distinguish between personal information that is public and that which is private. Personal information is defined as any information about an identifiable individual recorded in any form, including identifying numbers, symbols, or addresses. This definition is broad and likely includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Some personal information, such as financial or medical data, should be considered private. Conversely, some personal information, like names, street addresses, and phone numbers in a phone book, resides in the public domain and would likely not be considered private, though there are exceptions, such as unlisted phone numbers. In a network context, the equivalent information would be user names, domains, and corresponding addressing information published in public key certificates. While personal, this information is likely to be considered public.

### Privacy of Communication Content

Is the issue primarily about keeping the content of a particular communication private? There is little debate that the user-entered portion of a communication would be considered personal and private. If the originator does not want the contents of the message to be read by anyone other than the intended recipient, they can use encryption. Criminal law specifically mentions the electronic or other treatment of radio-based communications to prevent intelligible reception by anyone other than the intended recipient. Although there is no specific mention of similar treatment for other forms of telecommunication, if an individual takes steps to protect the communication, a reasonable expectation of privacy for the content of network communications is created.

### Packet Header Information

The situation is less clear when it comes to packet header information. Are headers an integral part of the communication, or are they separate from the content? An argument can be made that at least part of the header, such as the destination address in an email or the URL of a website, is generated in response to user input and should be considered private. However, certain information in network communications, such as routing and handling data, must be public. In conventional mail, this would be analogous to the addressing on the outside of an envelope, which is generally available to the public.

### Privacy of Communication Fact

Is the issue then about keeping the fact that a particular communication has occurred private? Simply intercepting the fact of a communication (i.e., traffic data) can lead to the development of a detailed user profile through traffic analysis, revealing personal, private information even if the data is public. Traffic data is defined as any computer data relating to a communication, generated by a computer system, indicating the communication's origin, destination, route, time, date, size, duration, or type of underlying service. In a telephone context, traffic data is generally a list of dialed numbers. In a network context, the range of possibilities extends from the header portion of network traffic to the address and subject lines of an email and web URLs. The only consistent element across differing views is that traffic data will contain IP addresses.

### Legal Implications

There seems to be an effort in certain legislation to distinguish between 'traffic' data and content. For example, the Council of Europe (COE) Convention on Cybercrime refers to interception and real-time access to traffic data. U.S. Code contains provisions for pen registers and trap and trace devices, which monitor and identify specific phone numbers without capturing the content of the communication. This distinction implies that traffic data is not considered private communication.

If the originator wants to disguise the fact that they initiated a particular message, they can use pseudonymizing techniques. These techniques increase the expectation of privacy, but many provide mechanisms for re-associating the communication with the originator in certain circumstances. Even anonymizing techniques might not be sufficient if the disclosure of encryption keys can be forced, potentially requiring providers of anonymizing services to retain records to re-associate anonymized traffic with the originator.

### Expectation of Privacy in Malicious Activity

What expectation of privacy does an individual involved in malicious activity have?
