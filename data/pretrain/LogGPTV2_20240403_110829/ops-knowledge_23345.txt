User: I have found that ultramysql meets my requirement. But it has no document, and no windows binary package.
I have a program heavy on internet downloads and mysql inserts. So I use gevent to solve the multi-download-tasks problem. After I downloaded the web pages, and parsed the web pages, I get to insert the data into mysql.
Is monkey.patch_all() make mysql operations async?
Can anyone show me a correct way to go.
Assistant: Postgres may be better suited due to its asynchronous capabilities
