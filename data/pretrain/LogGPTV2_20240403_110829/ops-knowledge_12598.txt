User: How can i get system idle time (no keys pressed - mouse moved) in C or Python?
EDIT: My program suspend a counter when idle time > 10 sec
Assistant: Is your application GUI-driven?
If so, you could start a timer when the GUI comes up and then have keyboard and mouse callbacks at the top level.  Every time the keyboard or mouse callback is triggered, reset the timer.  Otherwise when the timer goes off, it's handler code should suspend your counter.
If not, ignore this...  ;-)
