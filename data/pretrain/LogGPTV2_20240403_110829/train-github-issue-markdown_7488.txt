Currently types packages do not allow peerDependencies while the actual
packages can have peerDependencies. In this case react-redux allows redux to
match `^2.x.x || ^3.x.x || ^4.x.x`. The typings for redux v4 however have
changed so typescript is throwing `All declarations of 'Dispatch' must have
identical type parameters.`
Adding `"paths": { "redux": ["node_modules/redux"] }` to my tsconfig did not
solve this problem so I'm wondering what the current approach is to typings
for peerDependencies that have their own typings.
