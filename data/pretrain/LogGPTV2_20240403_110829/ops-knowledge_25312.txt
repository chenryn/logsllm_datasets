User: How to use Git version control to manage system configuration files and perform continuous integration and continuous deployment?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use Git version control to manage system configuration files and perform continuous integration and continuous deployment: 1. Create a Git warehouse to manage configuration files. You can use online Git repository services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, or create a Git repository locally. 2. Add the configuration files that need to be managed to the repository. These files may include application configuration, database configuration, server configuration, etc. 3. Create a branch for each development branch in the Git repository, such as develop, master, etc. All developers will work in these branches. 4. Create a new branch for each new feature or fix. Before making any changes, make sure to create a new branch from the corresponding development branch. 5. Have team members use Git to make changes in their local copies and push to relevant branches. Make sure to follow Git flow and code review best practices. 6. Perform continuous integration and continuous deployment. Integration tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI, etc. can be used to automatically build and test the code and deploy it to the test or production environment. Build and test on each branch, and merge it into the master branch after passing the tests. 7. Regularly clean up the Git warehouse and delete the merged branches. The above are the basic steps for using Git version control to manage system configuration files and perform continuous integration and continuous deployment. Through this process, teams can better manage code and configuration files and ensure that all changes are tested and successfully deployed to production.
