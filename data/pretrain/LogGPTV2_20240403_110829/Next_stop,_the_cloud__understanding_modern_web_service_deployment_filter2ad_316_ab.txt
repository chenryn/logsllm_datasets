### Cloud Usage Analysis

#### Domain and Subdomain Distribution
| Provider | Domains (%) | Subdomains (%) |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| EC2 only | 3,277 (8.1%) | 34,721 (86.1%) |
| EC2 + Other | 184 (0.5%) | 1,858 (4.6%) |
| Azure only | 293 (0.7%) | - |
| Azure + Other | - | - |
| EC2 + Azure | - | - |
| **Total** | 40,333 (100.0%) | 40,333 (100.0%) |
| **EC2 total** | 38,291 (94.9%) | - |
| **Azure total** | 2,335 (5.8%) | - |

- 225 (4%) of the domains on Alexa’s top 1 million list have a subdomain that uses EC2 and/or Azure.
- Under these domains, there are a total of 713,910 cloud-using subdomains.
- These numbers represent lower bounds on cloud usage, as our analysis approach does not flag domains that use a layer of indirection (e.g., via services like CloudFlare) before requests are sent to EC2 or Azure.

#### Breakdown of Cloud Usage
- **EC2 Only**: A subdomain is marked as EC2 only if it always resolves to IP addresses within EC2.
- **Azure Only**: Similarly, a subdomain is marked as Azure only if it always resolves to IP addresses within Azure.
- **Hybrid Usage**: Subdomains are marked as EC2+Azure, EC2+Other, or Azure+Other if they resolve to IP addresses associated with the appropriate subset of EC2, Azure, and other.
- **Domains**: Domains are counted as EC2 only if all of their subdomains only use EC2; similarly for Azure. Domains are marked as EC2+Azure, EC2+Other, or Azure+Other if they have subdomains associated with the indicated subset of EC2, Azure, and other.

#### Key Findings
- The vast majority (94.9%) of cloud-using domains use EC2, with most of these domains also using other hosting for some of their subdomains (i.e., EC2 + Other).
- Only 5.8% of domains use Azure.
- A small fraction (0.7%) of cloud-using domains use both EC2 and Azure.
- The distribution of Alexa ranks for cloud-using domains is skewed: higher-ranked domains are more likely to be cloud-using than lower-ranked domains. Specifically, 42.3% of cloud-using domains have ranks in the first 250,000 sites versus only 16.2% of the bottom 250K domains.
- The most frequent prefix used by cloud-using subdomains in our Alexa subdomains dataset is "www" (3.3% of all cloud-using subdomains). Other top prefixes (each <1%) include: m, ftp, cdn, mail, staging, blog, support, test, and dev.
- The majority of subdomains are hosted either only in the cloud or only elsewhere, although a small fraction (3%) appear to be hosted both on EC2 and other providers, which we might call a hybrid-cloud deployment.

### High Traffic Volume Domains
- We complement the above with an analysis of the top domains seen in the packet capture, as measured by traffic volume.
- Using Bro, we extract hostnames within HTTP requests and common names within the server certificates embedded in HTTPS flows.
- Aggregating the hostnames and common names by domain, we find 13,604 unique cloud-using domains: 12,720 use EC2 and 885 use Azure.
- Of these 13,604 domains, 6,902 were also identified as cloud-using via the Alexa dataset; the remainder were not in the Alexa top 1 million.
- Table 5 lists the highest 15 such domains in terms of traffic volume. A few tenants are responsible for a large fraction of the traffic. Most notably, dropbox.com accounts for almost 70% of the combined HTTP(S) traffic volume.
- This also explains why HTTPS (used by dropbox.com) dominates HTTP in terms of volume (though not number of flows, refer to Table 2).

### Summary and Implications
- A substantial fraction of the world’s most popular websites rely in whole or in part on public IaaS clouds, especially EC2.
- Most cloud-using domains have some subdomains hosted on a cloud service while other subdomains are hosted elsewhere.
- A small but noticeable fraction of subdomains use both a cloud and other hosting solutions.
- Traffic volume appears to be dominated by a few cloud tenants.
- Depending on how tenants deploy their services (e.g., how many and which regions they use), these observations have implications for the availability of web-based cloud-resident services. We explore the underlying deployments in more detail in §4.

### Traffic Patterns
- Our packet capture enables us to analyze not only who is running on the cloud but also the traffic patterns between clients in our university and cloud-resident web services.
- **Flow-level properties**: Figures 3a and 3b show CDFs of the number of HTTP and HTTPS flows, respectively, per-domain across our entire packet capture. We observe that ≈50% of domains have fewer than 1,000 HTTP flows, and more than 80% of domains have fewer than 1,000 HTTPS flows. The top 100 cloud-using domains are responsible for about 80% of the HTTP flows.
