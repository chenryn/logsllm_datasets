I'm reopening this issue (see #3494). @zcbenz closed it, citing that macOS
doesn't support hiding the separator. However; it seems to be working on El
Capitan (10.11.16).
On OSX, I have a menu that collapses as shown (when a user disables SSL):

On Windows, it looks like this:

The code responsible for this action looks like:
    sslmenu.items.forEach((item) => {
      item.visible = assets.CA.enabled
    })
Clearly, changing the visibility of a separator on OSX works while Windows
does not.
