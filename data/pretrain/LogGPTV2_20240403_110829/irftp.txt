**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `irftp` command is used to send files over an infrared link.

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure that the devices intended to communicate over the infrared link have their infrared functionality enabled and are functioning correctly.
- Verify that an infrared link has been established between the devices.

**Syntax:**
```sh
irftp [drive:\] [path] [/h] [/s]
```

**Parameters:**

- **drive:\**
  - Specifies the drive that contains the files you want to send over the infrared link.

- **[path]**
  - Specifies the location and name of the file or set of files you want to send. If you are sending multiple files, provide the full path for each file.

- **/h**
  - Enables hidden mode. In this mode, files are sent without displaying the Wireless Link dialog box.

- **/s**
  - Opens the Wireless Link dialog box, allowing you to select the file or set of files to send without specifying the drive, path, and file names on the command line. The Wireless Link dialog box will also open if you use the `irftp` command without any parameters.

**Examples:**

- To send `c:\example.txt` over the infrared link, type:
  ```sh
  irftp c:\example.txt
  ```

- To send a file in hidden mode, type:
  ```sh
  irftp c:\example.txt /h
  ```

- To open the Wireless Link dialog box and select the file to send, type:
  ```sh
  irftp /s
  ```
