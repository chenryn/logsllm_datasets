User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Installing gnome on Linode with Ubuntu 9.10 x64 - remote VNC/RDP I'm a self confessed Linux newbie, having lived and worked mostly within the Windows world for most of my life. I'm making the effort to try moving my virtual host from a Windows box to a Linode instance to try and better learn Linux, and one of the uses I occasionally have with my current Windows VPS is to RDP into it and browse the internet.

I'm aware that this is probably not best practice (from either performance or security), and most of the time I will be learning from the shell, but I do occasionally need to boot into a GUI.

Because of this, I'd like the ability within my Ubuntu installation on Linode to start/stop Windows X and Gnome at will after SSHing in (startx? gdm?), so I've tried:


apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
Reboot
startx


But I've got an error that no amount of googling has helped me with so far, which I'm assuming is something to do with the fact the box is headless and X needs some more configuration that is beyond me at the moment:

root@local:~# startx
hostname: Unknown host

Can anyone give me any pointers as to how to go from here and get VNC/RDP setup? (RDP would be preferred?).

Thanks.

Assistant: there isn't really a rdp server for linux. However NX is an excellent free, and flexible way to run a persistant, fast remote desktop. this is a complete, step by step guide to setting it up. then you can use the free client from nomachine.com to connect to it.
