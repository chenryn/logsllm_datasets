Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
A bunch of async child chunks in my application require a common dependency
(which lives within my repo). The common dependency also has its own 3rd party
dependencies (in node_modules). Webpack creates two output chunks which
**both** include the 3rd party dependencies:
  * childA~childB~childC
  * vendors~childA~childB~childC
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
  * Use default chunk-splitting behavior
  * Have several async child chunks
  * Have a large common 1st party (non-node_modules) dependency between those chunks
  * 1st party common dependency has large 3rd party dependencies
**What is the expected behavior?**  
The 3rd party code should only be present in one chunk, not both.
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**  
Webpack: v4.0.0-beta.0  
Node: 8.x
