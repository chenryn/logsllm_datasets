secedit /import
Imports security settings (.inf file), previously exported from the database configured with security templates.
Important
Before you import an .inf file to another computer, you must run the secedit /generaterollback command on the database on which the import will be performed.
secedit /generaterollback
You must also run the secedit /validate command on the import file to verify its integrity.
secedit /validate
Syntax
secedit /import /db  /cfg  [/overwrite] [/areas [securitypolicy | group_mgmt | user_rights | regkeys | filestore | services]] [/log ] [/quiet]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
/db
Required. Specifies the path and file name of the database containing the stored configuration against which the import is performed. If the file name specifies a database that hasn't had a security template (as represented by the configuration file) associated with it, the /cfg  option must also be specified.
/overwrite
Specifies whether the security template in the /cfg parameter should overwrite any template or composite template that is stored in the database, instead of appending the results to the stored template. This option is only valid when the /cfg  parameter is also used. If this parameter isn't also specified, the template in the /cfg parameter is appended to the stored template.
/cfg
Required. Specifies the path and file name for the security template that will be imported into the database for analysis. This option is only valid when used with the /db  parameter. If this parameter isn't also specified, the analysis is performed against any configuration already stored in the database.
/areas
Specifies the security areas to be applied to the system. If this parameter is not specified, all security settings defined in the database are applied to the system. To configure multiple areas, separate each area by a space. The following security areas are supported:securitypolicy: Local policy and domain policy for the system, including account policies, audit policies, security options, and so on. group_mgmt: Restricted group settings for any groups specified in the security template.user_rights: User logon rights and granting of privileges.regkeys: Security on local registry keys.filestore: Security on local file storage.services: Security for all defined services.
/log
Specifies the path and file name of the log file to be used in the process. If you don't specify a file location, the default log file, \Documents and Settings\\My Documents\Security\Logs\.log is used.
/quiet
Suppresses screen and log output. You can still view analysis results by using the Security Configuration and Analysis snap-in to the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

Examples
To export the security database and the domain security policies to an .inf file, and then to import that file to a different database to replicate the policy settings on another computer, type:
secedit /export /db C:\Security\FY11\SecDbContoso.sdb /mergedpolicy /cfg NetworkShare\Policies\SecContoso.inf /log C:\Security\FY11\SecAnalysisContosoFY11.log /quiet
To import just the security policies portion of the file to a different database on another computer, type:
secedit /import /db C:\Security\FY12\SecDbContoso.sdb /cfg NetworkShare\Policies\SecContoso.inf /areas securitypolicy /log C:\Security\FY11\SecAnalysisContosoFY12.log /quiet
