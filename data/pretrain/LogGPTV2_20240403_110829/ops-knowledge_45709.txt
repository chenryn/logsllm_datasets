User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SAMBA 4.1.6 create public share I just upgraded Ubuntu server to 14.04 which took samba up to 4.1.6.  My public share (local home network so not worried about security so much as family getting to files simply and anonymously), has stopped working, i.e. it will now ask for username and password.

when I run testparm I get:

Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
rlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)

I can not seem to get my windows (W7) machine to be able to anonymously access the share.  Not sure what is wrong with my config here.

Assistant: You have to be careful about the options. 

valid users=nobody, for example, does not mean that the user nobody is allowed log in. It means that no other user but nobody can log in. 

Since you are obviously fine to allow guest access, just remove valid users=nobody from the global section. 

Furthermore, while you have correctly set map to guest = bad user, you also have to check which user takes the role of guest on your system. Apparently, you have just assumed it's nobody but that's not necessarily the case. If you are not sure, you can specify it manually with guest account = nobody. Needless to say, nobody has to exist on your system! 

Next, you need to make sure that the share has the respective POSIX permissions for nobody. For example, if your file permissions allow nobody to read the files in the share but not to modify them, then the writeable option in smb.conf is not going to override that. 

Now we get to the share portion of your smb.conf, we can make this a lot simpler. If you wish to map all actions to the guest account, you don't need to use force user and force group. Just use the parameter guest only = yes instead. Together with guest ok = yes this will have the effect that all connections will be mapped to the correct guest account, in our case nobody. 

Result (for full guest access): 

# chmod -R a+rwX /srv/samba/share

/etc/samba/smb.conf
