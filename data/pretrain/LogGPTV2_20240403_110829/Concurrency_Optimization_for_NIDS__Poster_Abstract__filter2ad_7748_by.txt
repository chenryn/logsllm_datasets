Xenoamicin-related MFs were discovered by the substructures (spectral patterns) they shared Additionally, an aminosugar substructure motif 
revealed many potentially novel natural products Furthermore, integration of the discovery of mass spectral motifs by MS2LDA with automatic 
substructure annotation using MAGMa supports and accelerates substructure annotations Finally, the introduction of MotifDB, a repository for 
annotated spectral patterns (Mass2Motifs) from MS2LDA, reinforces substructure discovery by capturing community knowledge that will be reused 
by seeding MS2LDA with structurally annotated Mass2Motifs In conclusion, substructure annotation is a promising avenue to overcome challenges 
of metabolite annotation in complex metabolite mixtures

Identification of metabolites in large-scale 1H NMR data from human biofluids remains challenging due to the complexity of the spectra and their 
sensitivity to pH and ionic concentrations In this work, we test the capacity of three analysis tools to extract metabolite signatures from 968 
NMR profiles of human urine samples Specifically, we studied sets of co-varying features derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the 
Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA) and Averaged Correlation Profiles (ACP), a new method we devised inspired by the Statistical total correlation 
spectroscopy (STOCSY) approach We used our previously developed metabomatching (Rueedi et al 2017) method to match the sets generated by 
these algorithms to NMR spectra of individual metabolites available in public databases We concluded that both ISA and ACP can robustly identify 
about a dozen metabolites, half of which were shared, while PCA did not produce any signatures with robust matches

Learning from Experience: Non Trivial Issues and Solutions in LC-MS- Based Metabolomics Analysis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ilana Rogachev, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel
CO-AUTHORS: Maxim Itkin, Adam Jozwiak
It is likely that most if not all metabolomics specialists employing LC-MS-based technology encounter samples displaying un-predictable behavior 
in the LC column or during MS ionization While plenty of troubleshooting information is provided by instrument vendors they mostly concern 
with common LC-MS problems Quite the reverse, solutions for uncommon problems originating from specific extracts or metabolites is barely 
accessible In this presentation, I have composed a set of non-standard problems, engaged in our lab following more than 15 years of research in the 
HR LCMS-based metabolomics field Examples of such challenges include retention time shifts of metabolites in the presence of highly abundant 
compounds, absence of molecular ion in the MS chromatogram, and more Based on our past experience, I will provide several solutions and 
furthermore tips for predicting potential technical hitches prior to experimentation

and Comprehensive Identification with Lipostar

The polar lipidome of freshwater microalgae has been already investigated [1], mostly by liquid-chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution 
mass spectrometry (HRMS) [2] However, studies focused on method development for the chromatographic separation of glycosylglycerolipids, 
ie sulfoquinovosyldiacyl- and sulfoquinovosyl-monoacyl-glycerols, (SQDG, SQMG), monogalactosyldiacyl- and monogalactosylmonoacyl- 
glycerols, (MGDG, MGMG), digalactosyldiacyl- and digalactosylmonoacyl- glycerols (DGDG, DGMG), are lacking Due to glycosylglycerolipids high 
abundance in microalgae [1], in this study, a chromatographic optimization of both glycosylglycerolipids and phospholipids was carried out for the 
comprehensive characterization of spirulina microalgae lipidome A Kinetex-EVO C18 column was used on a ultrahigh-performance LC system 
coupled by electrospray ionization source to a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap HRMS Firstly, different chromatographic conditions were evaluated 
based on resolution, peak capacity, and peak shape, on a mixture of lipid standards The optimized conditions were used for the analysis of spirulina 
microalgae HRMS and MS/MS spectra were analyzed by Lipostar software [3] Lipostar was implemented in order to both improve the identification 
of phospholipids and to allow the identification of glycosylglycerols, resulting in the identification of 205 lipids [4] Finally, a targeted method was 
developed for the selective enrichment of SQDG and SQMG from spirulina microalgae, increasing the number of identified compounds References:

Engineering candidate sets for annotation using Extended Metabolic Models (EMMs)
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Soha Hassoun, TUFTS UNIVERSITY, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Neda Hassanpour, Alden, Nicholas, Kyongbum Lee
A major challenge in metabolomics analysis lies in resolving the chemical identities of detected features Computational annotation tools 
recommend one or more candidate chemical structure that best explains the spectral signature These approaches often rely on a candidate set 
that is typically culled from a large database such as PubChem However, not all such compounds are biologically relevant to the sample under 
study and there are many biologically relevant yet unknown compounds (“dark matter”) that are not catalogued at all We propose a novel method 
for systematically engineering candidate datasets that can be used during annotation Our central premise is that promiscuity of enzymes towards 
substrates within the sample is responsible for a large number of detected measurements To create an EMM, a reference metabolic model, 
cataloged in KEGG, BIGG, or BioCyc, for the organism(s) associated with the sample, is augmented with promiscuous metabolic products Such 
products are derived using PROXIMAL, a tool for predicting promiscuous products EMM metabolites with masses that match to measurements, 
within a small ppm, are considered for the candidate set We demonstrate the utility of our approach in annotation using an untargeted LC-MS 
dataset for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells Our test case shows that our EMMA (EMM Annotation) workflow creates a candidate set that is 
enzymatically relevant to the sample and that includes metabolites beyond what is already catalogued in PubChem Further, we experimentally 
confirm the identification of 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, a metabolite that is currently not part of the known catalog of CHO cell metabolites

High false positive rates in GC-MS metabolomics peak detection is a common issue that impedes automated analysis of large-scale data Many 
algorithms are available for peak detection but performance differs depending on algorithmic approach and data acquisition method This makes it 
difficult to compare between algorithms without extensive manual intervention We present a parameter optimizing, multi-algorithm peak detection 
workflow for GC-MS metabolomics which automatically evaluates the detected peaks’ quality using machine learning-based classification First, 
the classifier is trained to distinguish between real compound-related and false positive peaks Then the algorithm parameters are scored based 
on detected peaks quality and optimized accordingly This procedure is repeated for two peak detection algorithms and both algorithms are run in 
parallel on the entire data set with the optimized parameters The qualitative information returned by the classifier for every peak is used to merge 
individual algorithm results into one final high-confidence peakset Using this approach, we show that automated detection and evaluation of 
peak quality is possible with sensitivity of 90% on a standard compound mixture The information generated by the classifier allows: Optimization 
of individual peak detection algorithms parameters to increase performances, an objective way to assess peak detection algorithm performance, 
optional exclusion of peaks which are of intermediate to low quality We demonstrate that this workflow automatically recovers over 90% of the 
compounds identified in biological data by manual curation, so less than 10% of the peaks need user attention The workflow is suitable for large-
scale studies

A Metabolite Identification Guide for the Assignment of Unknown Signals in NMR Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Silke Heinzmann, Helmholtz Center Munich, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin
Identification of molecular features is still a bottleneck in non-targeted metabolomics Generally, only signals that are highlighted in a study in 
response to an intervention or associated to a (disease) phenotype are identified However, when aiming to name and count the metabolites that 
are visible by NMR spectroscopy, an answer is difficult Which and how many metabolites do we see in a given sample? Is there a set of metabolites 
that is present in most samples? How can we organize a straightforward workflow for the identification of metabolites? Here, we show a workflow for 
the identification of metabolites based on two-dimensional NMR analyses and structural correlation analyses First, we collect as much information 
as possible via NMR spectroscopy by acquisition of 1- and 2-dimensional experiments This information is then submitted to in-house and online 
databases (eg HMDB) In a second step, the CLASSY (ie cluster analysis statistical spectroscopy) method is used to cluster all peaks of the NMR 
spectrum, first locally (ie peaks that derive from the same molecule) and then globally (ie clusters that are biologically related) Thereby, known 
metabolites do cluster with unassigned peaks and facilitate structure elucidation by giving a suggestion on pathway relationships or chemical 
classes With this approach, we have identified several signatures from host-microbial co-metabolism and food metabolites that require microbial 
putrefaction processes The cluster analysis method gave valuable hints towards identification of previously not reported metabolites

Multi-feature based data processing of Data Independent acquisition metabolomics data without retention time information
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Stephen Tate, SCIEX, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Pradeep Narayanaswamy, Adam Lau, Lyle Burton
Mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography is the most popular method for untargeted metabolomics that detects thousands of 
features from complex samples, but only a fraction of them are annotated Each analyte can give rise to multiple features like in-source fragments 
(ISF), adducts, and different charge states Chromatography retention times (RT) of the metabolites is important orthogonal information required for 
avoiding pitfalls due to many features having similar mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios which can interfere with known compounds Recent advances in MS 
instrumentation with data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode like SWATH® acquisition gave unbiased MS/MS data capturing of all the features that 
are generated from metabolites Using multiple features, we developed a scoring model for confident identification of the metabolites LC-MS often 
produces multiple features along with due to adducts [Na, K, Li, NH4, Acetate, Formate, Cl etc], multiply charged, dimers and in-source fragments 
We developed a prediction model to generate in-silico MS/MS spectra for other features (ISF) based on the MS/MS of known features of M+H/M-H 
and then matched the observed fragments of in-silico spectra for sequence coverage against MS/MS spectra of molecular ion (M+H/M-H) to 
enhance the scoring of metabolites In complex mixtures, two or more peak groups that represent product ions are located at different RT intervals 
along with the expected peak group To address this challenge, we developed a model that correlates the peak groups across the SWATH windows 
for multiple features to identify right metabolite and reduce the false positive identifications

Targeted metabolomics – analytical method development and validation of free fatty acids in mammal’s plasma and tissue by 
gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Anna Bauer, Max Delbrück Center, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Raphaela Fritsche, Jennifer Kirwan
Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) are lipolysis byproducts primarily derived from adipose tissue High levels of plasma FFA have toxic effects on organs 
related to cardio metabolic disease Furthermore, lifelong exposure of populations to dietary fatty acids has raised concerns about the potential 
links between cognitive disorders and nutrition However, the association of FFAs with cognitive impairments or dementia is still unknown but 
there is obviously great interest in this field of research given the potential implications for human health In order that this area of research can be 
better studied, a well validated, quantitative analytical method is required A short and simple method by gas chromatography coupled to a mass 
spectrometer was developed to determine 21 FFA The optimized methodology entailed the formation of trimethylsilyl derivates using N-Methyl-N-
(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide after a one-step derivatization at 37 °C Compared to existing methods, the aim of this method was to develop a 
rapid qualitative and quantitative method for individual FFA suitable for both plasma and tissues of various types The analytical method is currently 
being fully validated according to European medicine guideline using external calibration curves All standard parameters important for a well 
validated method have been measured and optimized including precision (intra and inter-day), stability and reproducibility, limit of detection and 
lower and upper limits of quantification This is designed to work on an automated derivatization system, including the use of pooled quality control 
samples to both measure and reduce the technical variation in the analyses to a minimum

A complete workflow for improved untargeted metabolome annotation and identification using ultra high-resolution accurate 
mass and LC-MSn Orbitrap-based mass spectrometry
PRESENTING AUTHOR: David Peake, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Reiko Kiyonami, Ioanna Ntai, Amanda Souza, Ralf Tautenhahn
Compound identification is the most significant bottlenecks faced by researchers in untargeted metabolomics today The gold standard for 
structure elucidation in organic synthesis is a consensus of information from multiple analytical methods (2D-NMR, FTIR, UV-VIS and other methods) 
to characterize milligrams of purified material For identification of nanogram levels of metabolites in human plasma using mass spectrometric 
methods, confident annotation of known metabolites requires very high resolution, accurate mass measurement coupled with LC-MS and MS/
MS analysis SRM1950 (NIST) human pooled plasma extract was separated on a reversed-phase C18 column and LC-MS analyses were performed 
using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer Mass spectral data were acquired using 120K resolution MS and data dependent MS2 at 30K resolution 
Identifications were confirmed by spiking standards into the plasma extract and neat standard run under the same conditions Orbitrap-based mass 
analyzers offer many analytical advantages including ultra-high resolution, very high mass accuracy and precision, and multiple methods of ion 
activation with MSn capabilities for structure elucidation By combining accurate mass measurement, isotopic pattern, fine isotope structure and 
high quality mass spectra including fragmentation data with multiple structure database and mass spectral library searches one can achieve high 
confidence in metabolite annotations These concepts are illustrated with the analysis of NIST SRM1950 human plasma Using an automated and 
flexible data processing pipeline, it is possible to obtain consensus between all data sources giving higher confidence in metabolite annotation 
Ultimately, proof of identification requires comparison of a reference standard with the analyte under the same analytical conditions

Detecting Low Abundant Endogenous Cardiac Steroids from Biological Fluids Using a Structure-Based MSn Approach on an 
Orbitrap Tribrid MS
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sally Webb, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Reiko Kiyonami, Michael G. Harrington, Alfred N. Fonteh, Roger Biringer, Andreas Huhmer
Endogenous cardiac steroids are specific inhibitors of the sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase) and play important biological roles such as regulating 
cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, fibrosis, immunity, carbohydrate metabolism, and nervous and mental functions Detecting endogenous 
cardiac steroids from biological fluids is very challenging because of their low concentration (ng/ml) ranges and lack of authentic standards 
We have developed a novel structure-based MSn discovery approach which enables rapid annotation of cardiac steroid class compounds by 
identifying basic steroid sub-structure shared by cardiac steroid class compounds using MS2 and MS3 spectral tree data We applied this approach 
to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and were able to detect some endogenous cardiac steroids using complementary information of MS2 and 
MS3 data A Thermo Scientific™ Orbitrap ID-X™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer was used and MSn data was collected using an MS2 data directed data 
dependent approach Thermo Scientific™ Mass Frontier™ 80 software and Thermo Scientific™ Compound Discoverer™ 30 software was used for data 
processing with mzCloud™ spectral library and ChemSpiderTM database employed for the structural annotation of detected cardiac steroid class 
compounds Three cardiac steroid-like compounds were detected from a CSF sample using the structure-based approach Although the signals of 
these steroid class compounds are relatively low, both MS2 and MS3 data were being collected on these compounds, improving the sensitivity and 
selectivity of our workflow A targeted PRM assay of three detected putative cardiac steroids was used to multiple CSF samples for verifying they 
could be detected reproducibly from other CSF samples

Innovations in Unknown Identification for Metabolomics and Lipidomics

NIH has funded a new consortium charged with “catalyzing the field of compound identification to dramatically increase the number of identified 
biomedically-relevant metabolites in untargeted metabolomics” This presentation will explore innovations in identifying unknown metabolites 
and lipids; the primary focus will be on innovations at UF, but will include a perspective on innovations from the twelve other centers within the 
consortium Innovations for identifying unknown metabolites and lipids include two promising strategies, ion mobility and LC/MS/MS/NMR Ion 
mobility/mass spectrometry can separate isomeric metabolites, lipids (including eicosanoids and steroids) that are not resolved by chromatography 
and not readily differentiated by MS/MS Furthermore, determining an unknown’s collision cross section can help determine its structure We 
are developing software for processing LC/MS/MS data (including ion mobility data) that provides a wide coverage of lipids and improved lipid 
annotations Integrating LC/MS/MS with microflow NMR could provide the ideal platform for identification of unknown metabolites and lipids 
Although MS/MS is more sensitive and functions on the chromatographic timescale, the structural information provided by 1H NMR is invaluable, 
despite its lower sensitivity and longer timescale By digitizing the LC effluent using segmented flow, the timescale of LC and NMR is decoupled 
and “smart” selection of LC segments (based on MS/MS data) allows targeted NMR analysis Initial experiments are focused on differentiating lipid 
isomers, with extension to structure elucidation of unknown metabolites Experimental details and recent application of these strategies will be 
highlighted, along with a perspective on their impact in untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics

Combining Mass Difference Networks with Spectral Meta Data Analysis for Structural Characterization
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kris Morreel, Plant Systems Biology, VIB, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Sandrien Desmet, Atsushi Fukushima, Rebecca Dauwe, Geert Goeminne, Yvan Saeys, Wout Boerjan
Mass difference networks, such as Candidate Substrate Product Pair (CSPP) networks, implement knowledge on biochemical conversions for 
the structural characterization of unknowns This typically occurs via network propagation in which nodes and edges represent m/z features and 
enzymatic conversions Including Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID)-spectral similarities enhances both the efficiency and the reliability of this 
approach Here, we present RDynLib, an R package that (i) associates different types of CID spectra, ie MS/MS and MSn, to the CSPP network, 
and (ii) provides a set of functions to improve the elucidation of especially the unknown unknowns via a combined CSPP / CID spectral meta data 
analysis RDynLib is based on the alignment of chromatograms from different MS instruments following the prior archiving of all recorded CID 
spectra into the DynLib database The benefit of a CID spectral meta data analysis is demonstrated by matching the CID spectra against several 
freely available CID spectral databases

The majority of metabolites are not available as authentic reference material, making confident identification of most molecules in complex samples 
unachievable Also, the cost of synthesizing/purchasing standards and collecting experimental data on each individually, represents a major 
roadblock A promising approach to expand publicly available databases is through in silico calculation of molecular attributes We developed the in 
silico Chemical Library Engine (ISiCLE), a Python-based pipeline, designed to calculate chemical properties, including nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) chemical shifts, by employing density functional theory (DFT) Using ISiCLE, we investigated the accuracy required for identification of 11,000 
chloroform and water-soluble metabolites found in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) Of these, 90% can be correctly identified in a pure 
sample when errors of 1H and 13C chemical shifts reach at least 07 ppm and 6 ppm, respectively Furthermore, to decrease the calculated chemical 
shift error, it is possible to consider explicit solvation of metabolites This is especially critical for polar molecules, due to their strong interaction with 
polar solvents We built an automated solvation module of ISiCLE to evaluate explicit and implicit solvation at varying levels of theory This method 
generates a large solvation box, filled with a solvent of interest, surrounding the analyte, and subsequently optimizes the whole system Then, an 
optimum finite number of solvent shells is determined, and the remaining system is simulated with an implicit solvation model (ie, COSMO) We 
anticipate this automated solvation pipeline will enable efficient and rapid identification and delineation of metabolites in custom solvent conditions

Automated Screening of GC×GC-TOFMS Metabolomics Data Using Scripting
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Seo Lin Nam, University of Alberta, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Seo Lin Nam, A. Paulina de la Mata, James Harynuk
Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry is an analytical platform with high separation efficiency and 
is a powerful tool for the hybrid target/non-target analysis of complex mixtures However, the amount of data generated from such comprehensive 
techniques is massive and nearly impossible to handle manually The difficulty and complexity of data analysis is the major bottleneck in GC×GC-
TOFMS analysis, rather than the usual culprits of sample preparation or instrumental time The challenge of data processing is holding GC×GC-
TOFMS back from more widespread use In order to speed up and simplify data analysis, script-based filtering of peaks is a promising tool Scripting 
is a programming language of logic rules using mass spectrometric and/or retention properties for target compounds such as fragmentation 
patterns and/or the presence/absence of specific ions The use of scripting can help to quickly find and visualize compounds of interest and 
particular chemical classes in a sample of thousands of peaks For environmental and petroleum work, there are numerous scripts that have been 
published to aid with, for example, the identification of halogenated species Presented herein is the recent progress towards the development of a 
suite of scripts that classifying peaks in GC×GC-TOFMS data from metabolomics studies This includes the identification of fatty acid methyl esters,
