### Xenoamicin-Related Motifs and Substructure Annotation

Xenoamicin-related motifs (MFs) were identified through shared substructures (spectral patterns). Additionally, an aminosugar substructure motif revealed numerous potentially novel natural products. The integration of mass spectral motif discovery using MS2LDA with automatic substructure annotation via MAGMa enhances and accelerates the substructure annotation process. The introduction of MotifDB, a repository for annotated spectral patterns (Mass2Motifs) from MS2LDA, further reinforces substructure discovery by capturing community knowledge. This knowledge can be reused by seeding MS2LDA with structurally annotated Mass2Motifs. In conclusion, substructure annotation is a promising approach to overcome the challenges of metabolite annotation in complex mixtures.

Identifying metabolites in large-scale 1H NMR data from human biofluids remains challenging due to the complexity of the spectra and their sensitivity to pH and ionic concentrations. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of three analysis tools—Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA), and Averaged Correlation Profiles (ACP)—to extract metabolite signatures from 968 NMR profiles of human urine samples. Specifically, we analyzed sets of co-varying features derived from these algorithms and matched them to NMR spectra of individual metabolites available in public databases using our previously developed metabomatching method (Rueedi et al., 2017). Our results showed that both ISA and ACP could robustly identify about a dozen metabolites, with half of them being shared, while PCA did not produce any signatures with robust matches.

**Co-Authors:** Maxim Itkin, Adam Jozwiak

Metabolomics specialists employing LC-MS-based technology often encounter samples displaying unpredictable behavior in the LC column or during MS ionization. While instrument vendors provide troubleshooting information, it primarily addresses common issues. Solutions for uncommon problems, such as those arising from specific extracts or metabolites, are rarely accessible. In this presentation, I will discuss a set of non-standard problems encountered in our lab over more than 15 years of research in HR LC-MS-based metabolomics. Examples include retention time shifts of metabolites in the presence of highly abundant compounds and the absence of molecular ions in the MS chromatogram. Based on our experience, I will provide several solutions and tips for predicting potential technical hitches before experimentation.

The polar lipidome of freshwater microalgae has been studied using liquid-chromatography (LC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). However, methods for the chromatographic separation of glycosylglycerolipids, such as sulfoquinovosyldiacyl- and sulfoquinovosyl-monoacyl-glycerols (SQDG, SQMG), monogalactosyldiacyl- and monogalactosylmonoacyl-glycerols (MGDG, MGMG), and digalactosyldiacyl- and digalactosylmonoacyl-glycerols (DGDG, DGMG), are lacking. Given the high abundance of these lipids in microalgae, we optimized the chromatographic conditions for the comprehensive characterization of spirulina microalgae lipidome. We used a Kinetex-EVO C18 column on an ultrahigh-performance LC system coupled with electrospray ionization to a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap HRMS. Different chromatographic conditions were evaluated based on resolution, peak capacity, and peak shape, using a mixture of lipid standards. The optimized conditions were then applied to the analysis of spirulina microalgae. HRMS and MS/MS spectra were analyzed using Lipostar software, resulting in the identification of 205 lipids. Finally, a targeted method was developed for the selective enrichment of SQDG and SQMG, increasing the number of identified compounds.

### Engineering Candidate Sets for Annotation Using Extended Metabolic Models (EMMs)

**Co-Authors:** Neda Hassanpour, Alden, Nicholas, Kyongbum Lee

A major challenge in metabolomics analysis is resolving the chemical identities of detected features. Computational annotation tools recommend candidate chemical structures, but these often rely on a candidate set culled from large databases like PubChem. Not all such compounds are biologically relevant, and many biologically relevant yet unknown compounds ("dark matter") are not cataloged. We propose a novel method for systematically engineering candidate datasets for annotation. Our central premise is that enzyme promiscuity towards substrates within the sample is responsible for many detected measurements. To create an EMM, a reference metabolic model (cataloged in KEGG, BIGG, or BioCyc) for the organism(s) associated with the sample is augmented with promiscuous metabolic products derived using PROXIMAL. EMM metabolites with masses matching measurements within a small ppm are considered for the candidate set. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using an untargeted LC-MS dataset for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Our test case shows that our EMMA (EMM Annotation) workflow creates a candidate set enzymatically relevant to the sample, including metabolites beyond what is already cataloged in PubChem. We experimentally confirmed the identification of 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, a metabolite not previously known in CHO cell metabolites.

High false positive rates in GC-MS metabolomics peak detection impede automated analysis of large-scale data. Many algorithms are available for peak detection, but their performance varies depending on the algorithmic approach and data acquisition method. This makes it difficult to compare between algorithms without extensive manual intervention. We present a parameter-optimizing, multi-algorithm peak detection workflow for GC-MS metabolomics that automatically evaluates the quality of detected peaks using machine learning-based classification. First, the classifier is trained to distinguish between real compound-related and false positive peaks. Then, the algorithm parameters are scored based on the quality of detected peaks and optimized accordingly. This procedure is repeated for two peak detection algorithms, which are run in parallel on the entire dataset with the optimized parameters. The qualitative information returned by the classifier for each peak is used to merge individual algorithm results into a final high-confidence peakset. Using this approach, we show that automated detection and evaluation of peak quality is possible with a sensitivity of 90% on a standard compound mixture. The information generated by the classifier allows for the optimization of individual peak detection algorithm parameters, an objective way to assess peak detection algorithm performance, and the optional exclusion of peaks of intermediate to low quality. We demonstrate that this workflow automatically recovers over 90% of the compounds identified in biological data by manual curation, reducing the need for user attention to less than 10% of the peaks. The workflow is suitable for large-scale studies.

### A Metabolite Identification Guide for the Assignment of Unknown Signals in NMR Metabolomics

**Presenting Author:** Silke Heinzmann, Helmholtz Center Munich, Germany  
**Co-Author:** Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin

Identifying molecular features remains a bottleneck in non-targeted metabolomics. Typically, only signals highlighted in a study in response to an intervention or associated with a (disease) phenotype are identified. However, naming and counting the metabolites visible by NMR spectroscopy is challenging. Which and how many metabolites do we see in a given sample? Is there a set of metabolites present in most samples? How can we organize a straightforward workflow for the identification of metabolites? Here, we present a workflow for the identification of metabolites based on two-dimensional NMR analyses and structural correlation analyses. First, we collect as much information as possible via NMR spectroscopy by acquiring 1- and 2-dimensional experiments. This information is then submitted to in-house and online databases (e.g., HMDB). In the second step, the CLASSY (cluster analysis statistical spectroscopy) method is used to cluster all peaks of the NMR spectrum, first locally (peaks that derive from the same molecule) and then globally (clusters that are biologically related). Known metabolites cluster with unassigned peaks, facilitating structure elucidation by suggesting pathway relationships or chemical classes. With this approach, we have identified several signatures from host-microbial co-metabolism and food metabolites that require microbial putrefaction processes. The cluster analysis method provided valuable hints for identifying previously unreported metabolites.

### Multi-Feature Based Data Processing of Data-Independent Acquisition Metabolomics Data Without Retention Time Information

**Presenting Author:** Stephen Tate, SCIEX, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Pradeep Narayanaswamy, Adam Lau, Lyle Burton

Mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography is the most popular method for untargeted metabolomics, detecting thousands of features from complex samples, but only a fraction of them are annotated. Each analyte can give rise to multiple features, such as in-source fragments (ISF), adducts, and different charge states. Chromatography retention times (RT) of metabolites are important orthogonal information required to avoid pitfalls due to many features having similar mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios, which can interfere with known compounds. Recent advances in MS instrumentation with data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode, such as SWATH® acquisition, provide unbiased MS/MS data capturing all features generated from metabolites. Using multiple features, we developed a scoring model for confident identification of metabolites. LC-MS often produces multiple features due to adducts [Na, K, Li, NH4, Acetate, Formate, Cl, etc.], multiply charged, dimers, and in-source fragments. We developed a prediction model to generate in-silico MS/MS spectra for other features (ISF) based on the MS/MS of known features (M+H/M-H) and then matched the observed fragments of in-silico spectra for sequence coverage against MS/MS spectra of molecular ion (M+H/M-H) to enhance the scoring of metabolites. In complex mixtures, two or more peak groups representing product ions are located at different RT intervals along with the expected peak group. To address this challenge, we developed a model that correlates the peak groups across the SWATH windows for multiple features to identify the right metabolite and reduce false positive identifications.

### Targeted Metabolomics: Analytical Method Development and Validation of Free Fatty Acids in Mammalian Plasma and Tissue by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry

**Presenting Author:** Anna Bauer, Max Delbrück Center, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Raphaela Fritsche, Jennifer Kirwan

Plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) are lipolysis byproducts primarily derived from adipose tissue. High levels of plasma FFAs have toxic effects on organs related to cardio-metabolic disease. Furthermore, lifelong exposure to dietary fatty acids has raised concerns about potential links between cognitive disorders and nutrition. However, the association of FFAs with cognitive impairments or dementia is still unknown, but there is great interest in this field of research given the potential implications for human health. To better study this area, a well-validated, quantitative analytical method is required. We developed a short and simple method using gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer to determine 21 FFAs. The optimized methodology entailed the formation of trimethylsilyl derivatives using N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide after a one-step derivatization at 37 °C. Compared to existing methods, the aim was to develop a rapid qualitative and quantitative method for individual FFAs suitable for both plasma and tissues of various types. The analytical method is currently being fully validated according to European medicine guidelines using external calibration curves. All standard parameters important for a well-validated method, including precision (intra- and inter-day), stability and reproducibility, limit of detection, and lower and upper limits of quantification, have been measured and optimized. This method is designed to work on an automated derivatization system, including the use of pooled quality control samples to measure and reduce technical variation in the analyses to a minimum.

### A Complete Workflow for Improved Untargeted Metabolome Annotation and Identification Using Ultra-High-Resolution Accurate Mass and LC-MSn Orbitrap-Based Mass Spectrometry

**Co-Authors:** Reiko Kiyonami, Ioanna Ntai, Amanda Souza, Ralf Tautenhahn

Compound identification is the most significant bottleneck in untargeted metabolomics today. The gold standard for structure elucidation in organic synthesis is a consensus of information from multiple analytical methods (2D-NMR, FTIR, UV-VIS, etc.) to characterize milligrams of purified material. For the identification of nanogram levels of metabolites in human plasma using mass spectrometric methods, confident annotation of known metabolites requires very high resolution, accurate mass measurement coupled with LC-MS and MS/MS analysis. SRM1950 (NIST) human pooled plasma extract was separated on a reversed-phase C18 column, and LC-MS analyses were performed using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Mass spectral data were acquired using 120K resolution MS and data-dependent MS2 at 30K resolution. Identifications were confirmed by spiking standards into the plasma extract and neat standard runs under the same conditions. Orbitrap-based mass analyzers offer many analytical advantages, including ultra-high resolution, very high mass accuracy and precision, and multiple methods of ion activation with MSn capabilities for structure elucidation. By combining accurate mass measurement, isotopic pattern, fine isotope structure, and high-quality mass spectra, including fragmentation data, with multiple structure database and mass spectral library searches, one can achieve high confidence in metabolite annotations. These concepts are illustrated with the analysis of NIST SRM1950 human plasma. Using an automated and flexible data processing pipeline, it is possible to obtain consensus between all data sources, giving higher confidence in metabolite annotation. Ultimately, proof of identification requires comparison of a reference standard with the analyte under the same analytical conditions.

### Detecting Low Abundant Endogenous Cardiac Steroids from Biological Fluids Using a Structure-Based MSn Approach on an Orbitrap Tribrid MS

**Presenting Author:** Sally Webb, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Reiko Kiyonami, Michael G. Harrington, Alfred N. Fonteh, Roger Biringer, Andreas Huhmer

Endogenous cardiac steroids are specific inhibitors of the sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase) and play important biological roles, such as regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, fibrosis, immunity, carbohydrate metabolism, and nervous and mental functions. Detecting endogenous cardiac steroids from biological fluids is challenging due to their low concentration (ng/ml) ranges and lack of authentic standards. We developed a novel structure-based MSn discovery approach that enables rapid annotation of cardiac steroid class compounds by identifying basic steroid sub-structures shared by cardiac steroid class compounds using MS2 and MS3 spectral tree data. We applied this approach to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and were able to detect some endogenous cardiac steroids using complementary information from MS2 and MS3 data. A Thermo Scientific™ Orbitrap ID-X™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer was used, and MSn data was collected using an MS2 data-directed, data-dependent approach. Thermo Scientific™ Mass Frontier™ 8.0 software and Thermo Scientific™ Compound Discoverer™ 3.0 software were used for data processing, with mzCloud™ spectral library and ChemSpider™ database employed for the structural annotation of detected cardiac steroid class compounds. Three cardiac steroid-like compounds were detected from a CSF sample using the structure-based approach. Although the signals of these steroid class compounds are relatively low, both MS2 and MS3 data were collected, improving the sensitivity and selectivity of our workflow. A targeted PRM assay of three detected putative cardiac steroids was used to verify their reproducible detection from other CSF samples.

### Innovations in Unknown Identification for Metabolomics and Lipidomics

The NIH has funded a new consortium aimed at "catalyzing the field of compound identification to dramatically increase the number of identified biomedically-relevant metabolites in untargeted metabolomics." This presentation will explore innovations in identifying unknown metabolites and lipids, focusing on innovations at the University of Florida and providing a perspective on innovations from the twelve other centers within the consortium. Innovations for identifying unknown metabolites and lipids include two promising strategies: ion mobility and LC/MS/MS/NMR. Ion mobility/mass spectrometry can separate isomeric metabolites, lipids (including eicosanoids and steroids) that are not resolved by chromatography and not readily differentiated by MS/MS. Determining an unknown's collision cross-section can help determine its structure. We are developing software for processing LC/MS/MS data (including ion mobility data) that provides wide coverage of lipids and improved lipid annotations. Integrating LC/MS/MS with microflow NMR could provide the ideal platform for the identification of unknown metabolites and lipids. Although MS/MS is more sensitive and operates on the chromatographic timescale, the structural information provided by 1H NMR is invaluable, despite its lower sensitivity and longer timescale. By digitizing the LC effluent using segmented flow, the timescale of LC and NMR is decoupled, and "smart" selection of LC segments (based on MS/MS data) allows targeted NMR analysis. Initial experiments are focused on differentiating lipid isomers, with extension to structure elucidation of unknown metabolites. Experimental details and recent applications of these strategies will be highlighted, along with a perspective on their impact in untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics.

### Combining Mass Difference Networks with Spectral Meta Data Analysis for Structural Characterization

Mass difference networks, such as Candidate Substrate Product Pair (CSPP) networks, implement knowledge on biochemical conversions for the structural characterization of unknowns. This typically occurs via network propagation, where nodes and edges represent m/z features and enzymatic conversions. Including Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID)-spectral similarities enhances both the efficiency and reliability of this approach. Here, we present RDynLib, an R package that (i) associates different types of CID spectra, i.e., MS/MS and MSn, to the CSPP network, and (ii) provides a set of functions to improve the elucidation of especially the unknown unknowns via a combined CSPP/CID spectral meta-data analysis. RDynLib is based on the alignment of chromatograms from different MS instruments following the prior archiving of all recorded CID spectra into the DynLib database. The benefit of a CID spectral meta-data analysis is demonstrated by matching the CID spectra against several freely available CID spectral databases.

The majority of metabolites are not available as authentic reference material, making confident identification of most molecules in complex samples unachievable. The cost of synthesizing/purchasing standards and collecting experimental data on each individually represents a major roadblock. A promising approach to expand publicly available databases is through in silico calculation of molecular attributes. We developed the in silico Chemical Library Engine (ISiCLE), a Python-based pipeline designed to calculate chemical properties, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, by employing density functional theory (DFT). Using ISiCLE, we investigated the accuracy required for the identification of 11,000 chloroform and water-soluble metabolites found in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). Of these, 90% can be correctly identified in a pure sample when errors of 1H and 13C chemical shifts reach at least 0.7 ppm and 6 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, to decrease the calculated chemical shift error, it is possible to consider explicit solvation of metabolites. This is especially critical for polar molecules due to their strong interaction with polar solvents. We built an automated solvation module of ISiCLE to evaluate explicit and implicit solvation at varying levels of theory. This method generates a large solvation box filled with a solvent of interest, surrounding the analyte, and subsequently optimizes the whole system. Then, an optimum finite number of solvent shells is determined, and the remaining system is simulated with an implicit solvation model (i.e., COSMO). We anticipate this automated solvation pipeline will enable efficient and rapid identification and delineation of metabolites in custom solvent conditions.

### Automated Screening of GC×GC-TOFMS Metabolomics Data Using Scripting

**Presenting Author:** Seo Lin Nam, University of Alberta, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** A. Paulina de la Mata, James Harynuk

Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS) is an analytical platform with high separation efficiency and is a powerful tool for the hybrid target/non-target analysis of complex mixtures. However, the amount of data generated from such comprehensive techniques is massive and nearly impossible to handle manually. The difficulty and complexity of data analysis are the major bottlenecks in GC×GC-TOFMS analysis, rather than the usual culprits of sample preparation or instrumental time. The challenge of data processing is holding GC×GC-TOFMS back from more widespread use. To speed up and simplify data analysis, script-based filtering of peaks is a promising tool. Scripting is a programming language of logic rules using mass spectrometric and/or retention properties for target compounds, such as fragmentation patterns and/or the presence/absence of specific ions. The use of scripting can help quickly find and visualize compounds of interest and particular chemical classes in a sample of thousands of peaks. For environmental and petroleum work, numerous scripts have been published to aid with, for example, the identification of halogenated species. Presented herein is the recent progress towards the development of a suite of scripts that classify peaks in GC×GC-TOFMS data from metabolomics studies, including the identification of fatty acid methyl esters, and other classes of compounds.
