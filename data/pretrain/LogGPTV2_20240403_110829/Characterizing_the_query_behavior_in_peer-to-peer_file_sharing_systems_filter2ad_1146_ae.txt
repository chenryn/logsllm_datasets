### Analysis of Query Interarrival Time and Session Characteristics

**Figure 9. Distribution of Time After Last Query for Active Sessions by Region**

- **Time After Last Query (sec)**: The x-axis represents the time in seconds after the last query.
- **Peers in Europe**: This figure shows the distribution of the time after the last query for active sessions in Europe.

**Correlation Analysis**

1. **Query Interarrival Time and Number of Queries per Session**:
   - For North American peers, there is no significant correlation between query interarrival time and the number of queries per session.
   - For European peers, sessions with many queries have smaller interarrival times compared to sessions with fewer queries (see Figure 8(b)).
   - This suggests differences in the internet service provider pricing models or other environmental factors, leading to longer connection periods for North American peers with many queries compared to similar European sessions.
   - Conclusion: Query interarrival time should be conditioned on the number of queries per session for European peers but not for North American peers.

2. **Correlation with Time of Day**:
   - **Figure 8(c)**: The CCDF of query interarrival time for European peers, broken down by important daily time periods.
   - Queries issued during peak hours (all daily periods except 03:00-04:00) have longer interarrival times than those issued during non-peak hours.
   - Example: 94% of queries issued between 03:00 and 04:00 have an interarrival time below 100 seconds, while this fraction is only 85% for sessions starting between 11:00 and 12:00.
   - Similar results are observed for other geographical regions.
   - Conclusion: Query interarrival time is significantly correlated with the time of day.

3. **Modeling Conditional Distributions**:
   - A bimodal distribution composed of a lognormal body and a Pareto tail fits well with the measured query interarrival times (see Figure A.1(c)).
   - Parameters for the conditional distributions are summarized in Table A.4.

**Time After Last Query Analysis**

1. **Geographical Region**:
   - **Figure 9(a)**: The CCDF of the time after the last query, broken down by geographical region.
   - Only a small fraction of peers close the connection within 12 seconds after the last query.
   - Distributions are similar for North American and European peers, but Asian peers tend to close sessions faster.
   - Example: The fraction of sessions with a time after the last query of more than 1000 seconds is 20% for Europe and North America, but only 10% for Asia.
   - Conclusion: There is a significant correlation between the time after the last query and the geographical region.

2. **Number of Queries per Session**:
   - **Figure 9(b)**: The smallest and greatest values for the time after the last query are observed for sessions with a single query and 8 or more queries, respectively.
   - Conditional distributions for 2 queries and 3 to 7 queries are nearly identical for 99% of the sessions.
   - Combining these distributions, we observe a positive correlation between the time after the last query and the number of queries per session for 90% of the sessions.
   - Conclusion: The distribution of the time after the last query must be conditioned on the number of queries per session.

3. **Time of Day for European Peers**:
   - **Figure 9(c)**: Sessions sending the last query in non-peak hours (e.g., 03:00-04:00) have a shorter time after the last query compared to sessions in peak hours.
   - Example: For sessions sending the last query between 03:00 and 04:00, the time after the last query is below 10,000 seconds for more than 99% of the sessions, while it is below 91% for other times.
   - Similar trends are observed for North American peers.
   - Conclusion: The time after the last query is significantly correlated with the time of day.

- The time after the last query, conditioned on geographical region, time of day, and number of queries per session, is well modeled by a lognormal distribution. Parameters for the conditional distributions are provided in Table A.5.

### Query Popularity Distribution

**Hot Set Drift**

- **Figure 10**: The CCDF of the observed distributions for North American peers.
- For about 80% of the days, the number of top 10 queries found in the top 100 on the subsequent day is not larger than 4, indicating a significant hot set drift.
- Even the top 100 queries change significantly from day to day.
- Conclusion: The query popularity distribution cannot be calculated over the entire trace; the hot set drift must be considered.

**Geographical Influence**

- **Table 3**: The cardinality of the intersection between the query sets of North American and European peers is about 2.8% for a single day and not more than 6% for a 4-day period.
- The relative cardinality of the intersection of the query sets from all three continents is about 0.001% to 0.02%.
- Conclusion: Peers from different geographical regions issue different queries, but there is a small intersection that should be considered in an accurate workload model.

**Methodology for Calculating Query Popularity Distributions**

- To account for geographical correlations, queries for each day are divided into seven sets: one for queries issued only from a single geographical region, three for queries issued by peers from two geographical regions, and one for queries issued by peers from all three regions.
- Queries are ranked by their frequency for each day and each subset.
- The average frequency for a query with rank i is calculated for all days, preserving the hot-set drift and obtaining an average distribution of query popularity for a single day.

**Popularity Distributions**

- **Figure 11**: The pmf of the popularity distributions for queries issued only by North American peers, only by European peers, and by both North American and European peers.
- On a log-log scale, the curves are nearly linear, indicating a Zipf-like distribution.
- The skew in the Zipf-like distribution (i.e., the slope of the line) is somewhat different for each region:
  - αNA=0.386 for North America
  - αE=0.223 for Europe
- The popularity distribution for queries issued by both North American and European peers has a flattened head and is fit by two different Zipf-like distributions:
  - αI,body=0.453 for queries ranked 1 to 45
  - αI,tail=4.67 for queries ranked 46 to 100
- Smaller Zipf parameters indicate that caching of responses will be more effective in systems using aggressive automated re-query features.

**Synthetic Workload Generation**

- For North American peers, a query is in the set of North American queries with a probability of 0.97 and in the intersection set with a probability of 0.03.
- The query is then chosen by a Zipf-like distribution with the parameter determined by Figure 11 for the corresponding set.
- Example: Using only North America and Europe, the query set is chosen with the specified probabilities, and the query is selected based on the appropriate Zipf parameter.

| Asian Peers | 776 | 299 | 153 |

| Intersection (North American & Asian) | 41 | 15 | 5 |
| Intersection (European & Asian) | 28 | 10 | 5 |
| Intersection (All Three) | 17 | 4 | 2 |
