Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). To investigate
the effect of behavioral and physiological features on the
performance of the system, we repeat the mRMR algorithm
separately on each feature group and report the ROC for FAR
and FRR in Figure 14. The area-under-curve (AUC) values for
models using behavioral features, physiological features and
both categories are 87.59%, 95.43%, and 98.31% respectively.
Fig. 15: The EERs are stable in the one-day short-term period.
Physiological features perform signiﬁcantly better (smaller
FAR) than behavior features especially when FRR is small.
This indicates when the system gives more “accept” decisions
(smaller FRR), the model using behavioral features quickly
becomes misjudging and accepts wrong users. This is because
behavioral features are less distinctive than physiological fea-
tures and thus more acceptance results in higher FAR.
From the results above, we conclude that the proposed
physiological features of HVS play the essential role in differ-
entiating users. Besides, traditional behavioral features based
on saccades and ﬁxations is less important but still contributes
to the authentication. Therefore, both feature categories should
be used in OcuLock.
D. Short-term and Long-term Performance
The physical and mental states of human users change
over time. In this section, we investigate the impacts of time
on authentication performance. We ﬁrst conduct a short-term
study at different
time of a day. We aim to evaluate the
impacts of eye fatigue and strains. Five subjects (Two subjects
were group members and the rest three were from the general
public) were recruited for this experiments. Since they worked
on their personal computers extensively during the day, it
is expected that their eye fatigue and strain increase with
time. We started the ﬁrst experiment at 10 AM and continued
four more experiments until 6 PM. Samples from the 10
AM experiment were set as original. We used the optimal
comparator trained in Section VIII-A (AB Test and SVM-
poly) to continuously compare samples from later experiments
with original ones. Figure 15 illustrates the one-day short-term
EER for three models trained using physiological features,
behavioral features and both physiological and behavioral

models including physiological features is much more stable
than the model only using behavioral features.
features (as categorized in Table I). It is interesting to observe
that there is no signiﬁcant ﬂuctuation of EERs. This suggests
the negligible impacts of eye fatigue and short-term cognitive
states on our HVS-based authentication. The average EER
for the model only using physiological features is 47% less
than the average EER for the model only using behavioral
features. Combining both feature categories further reduces
EERs during the day down to 3.71%. This indicates that
low-level HVS features, especially HVS biostructure, can be
uniquely triggered in VR HMD, and outperform traditional eye
gaze behavior features.
One weakness of gaze biometric is that the performance
degrades quickly as time passes by because eye movement
is highly dependent on the cognitive states and gaze patterns
constantly change. We performed a long-term over a two-
month period to investigate the stability of OcuLock. The
ﬁrst set of records collected from the recruited 5 users were
set as original. Then we kept collecting records from these
subjects once every three days and evaluated the consistency
of authentication results. The EERs results are demonstrated
in Figure 16. EERs for the model using physiological features
slowly increase from 8.51% at the ﬁrst day to 10.64% at the
25th day and remain stable after that. In contrast, EERs for
the model using behavioral features quickly and continuously
raise from 17.42% all the way up to 30.96%. Two subjects
were our group members and their knowledge of the system
may bias performance stability. However, we did not observe
noticeable difference in performance stability between these
group members and others. This is because the biostructural
information represented by physiological features are less
susceptible to change over time, and it cannot be controlled by
subjects. In OcuLock, we utilize this fact to achieve a far more
stable EER performance than existing eye gaze biometric by
combining both feature categories. Since using both feature
categories still slowly increases EER (3.17% to 6.18% over
2 months), VR users can strike a tradeoff between EOG
update frequency and authentication accuracy. When users
cannot accept the accuracy after 2 or more months, they can
record new EOG ground truth samples based on their current
physiological and behavioral features.
IX. SECURITY ANALYSIS
In this section, we investigate the security of the system
against two types of attacks discussed in Section III: imper-
sonation attack and statistical attack.
11
Fig. 17: The ROC curves (left) and EERs (right) under
impersonation attack for three stimuli.
A. Impersonation Attack
Impersonation attack is the most simple and popular type of
attacks in which the adversaries are not required to have prior
knowledge about the legitimate user’s HVS information. They
simply try to be the owner and follow the standard authenti-
cation procedure. Since OcuLock is unobservable, adversaries
also cannot obtain much information to assist the attacks by
observing owner’s authentication action. What they can see are
only minor head and body motions. To emulate impersonation
attacks, one user is assigned as the legitimate user and the
others become attackers to perform “attack attempts”. This
process is repeated for all users in the test set. The system
is then evaluated using ROC curves, EER and F1 scores.
ROC. Figure 17 reports how well our system performs
against the impersonation attack using ROC curves. During the
authentication process, the comparator of OcuLock produces
probability values indicating chances that
the input signal
belongs to the owner or the attacker. An authentication decision
is then produced by comparing probability values with a
predeﬁned threshold. The ROC could be built by varying this
threshold and recording the false acceptance rate and false
rejection rate. The ROC gives an overall picture about the
system security at every comparator threshold.
In Figure 17, the AUC values for ROC curves correspond-
ing to three stimuli are 97.62%, 96.08% and 98.31%. For all
stimuli, the ROC curves of the comparator stay closely to the
top-left corner where both FAR and FRR are minimized. The
derived AUC values are close to the 1.0 mark even though
the curve for City-Street stays a little lower than the others.
The shape of the ROC curves and the AUC values indicates
OcuLock performs well
in terms of false acceptance and
rejection for all model thresholds.
EER and F1 score. EER values are depicted in Figure
17, where City-Street shows an EER of 7.32% with STD of
1.48%, while the EER of Fixed-Route is 5.27% with STD of
1.41% and Illusion is 3.55% with STD of 1.34%. Similarly,
we calculate the F1 scores for these stimuli and ﬁnd a strong
correlation to EER,
i.e., 98.32%, 97.89% and 98.33% for
Fixed-Route, City-Street and Illusion respectively.
The resistance to impersonation attacks depends on the
stimuli, i.e., it is better in Illusion but a little worse in City-
Street. This is due to the fact that the HVS activities when
viewing different stimuli are different. The City-Street allows
subjects to freely scan through the picture, where subjects tend
to conduct “smooth pursuit eye movements” whose speed is
voluntarily controlled and not reﬂecting extraocular muscle

statistical attack for three stimuli.
conditions. Also after scanning the entire picture, subjects
would reduce eye movements and stare at one point, which
generate more silent segments in their EOG signal records.
With less information conveyed by the records, it is harder for
the comparator to differentiate subjects. Thus City-Street has
the lowest F1 scores and highest EER. On the contrary, the
Fixed-Route and Illusion both require subjects to continuously
follow a dynamic target jumping at a given speed allowing
more HVS activities to be produced. Hence their EOG signal
records consistently contain more low-level HVS information
and are easier to distinguish.
B. Statistical Attack
Statistical attack is a stronger form of attack in which
the adversaries are assumed to have some knowledge about
the statistics from a group of users. The attacker calculates
the probability density function of features from users and
then use the most probable feature values to generate the
forgery.Statistical attacks have been performed for behavior
biometrics [48], [32], [33], [34].
To simulate statistical attack, we assume the attacker gains
insights into the statistics of all enrolled users in the system
(but not the exact record of the victim). The attackers are also
able to forge fake EOG signals with desired feature values.
We then follow the procedure suggested by [48] to generate
forged features from real feature values. First, the attackers
reconstruct a histogram approximating the distribution of the
values of one given feature from all users. Each histogram
comprises 5 bins of equal size. Fake values of the feature are
then created by sampling uniformly from the bin in which
the feature value has the highest probability. This procedure
is repeated for all features to create one fake sample. We
performed the statistical attack using the fake records and
records from all 70 subjects. During the test, all the subject’s
records were compared with each other, which generated 45
positive samples. Meanwhile her records were attacked by the
fake records, which generated 1500 negative samples. With 70
subjects, the testing set contained 3,150 positive samples and
10,5000 negative samples. Then the ROC curves, EERs and
F1 scores were recorded.
ROC. Figure 18 reports the FARs and FRRs for the model
at various thresholds. The AUC for curves from Fixed-Route,
City-Street and Illusion are 96.11%, 94.78% and 96.23%
respectively. In all stimuli, the curves stay close to the upper-
left corner where both FAR and FRR are minimized suggesting
the resistance of the model against statistical attack. The AUC
score for City-Street is lower than the other two, which is

consistent with our previous conclusion about the uncertainty
nature of this stimulus. The AUC score for statistical attack is
lower than impersonation attack by a small amount suggesting
this type of attack is stronger but does not severely affect the
model performance.
EER and F1 score. Figure 18 reports the EER of the
model. As expected, Illusion has the lowest EER at 4.97%
while the EER for City-Street is the highest at 7.93% due to
the random exploration behavior in this stimulus. The EERs in
all stimuli are on average 1.08% higher than EERs from the
Impersonation attack. The comparator model attains F1 scores
of 97.62%, 96.59%, 97.55% in Fixed-Route, City-Street, and
Illusion respectively, which is on average 0.92% lower than
F1 scores for models under impersonation attack.
Compared with the reported results in impersonation attack,
the performance for the comparator model under statistical at-
tack are worse suggesting statistical attack are more powerful.
However, our authentication system still achieve promising
scores in both F1 score and EER. We surmise that
the
resistance of our model against statistical attack is because the
feature values among different people spread widely, which
makes it harder to predict feature values for a speciﬁc person
based on the statistical information.
X. USER EXPERIENCE
Gathering subjects’ opinions towards system usability is
necessary as an authentication system requires extensive in-
teraction with users. To gather the subjects’ opinions towards
OcuLock, all 70 subjects participating in the experiments were
given paper-form questionnaires in person immediately after
the experiments. The questionnaire includes several questions
on subjects’ experience of the authentication system. Each
subject was asked to ﬁlled out
the questionnaire and the
answers were scored from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
Table II quantiﬁes the subjects’ feelings towards OcuLock.
Most users preferred stimuli with explicit moving targets to
follow (Q1, Q3) over complicated static scene where they have
to subjectively scan through (Q2). This indicates the desirabil-
ity to design stimuli with dynamic and attractive patterns. In
addition, subjects preferred the duration of authentication to be
at around 4 seconds and should not be more than 8 seconds.
Our system can provide acceptable performance within this
time frame, as discussed in Section VIII-B.
We further conducted another survey of the subject’s opin-
ions towards several potential authentication methods for VR
HMD. After describing all methods to subjects in detail, opin-
ion scores were recorded on four criteria: security, reliability,

signals through EOG.
Eye-based Authentication. Existing eye-based authenti-
cation systems were designed for smartphones and PCs and
focused on the uniqueness of eye globe movement. Most of
them collected the gaze pattern stimulated by visual stimuli
via video cameras or other types of eye trackers and then
crafted a set of features for authentication [3], [23], [19],
[47], [15]. These features include scanpath and more detailed
statistics such as acceleration and duration of saccades [12]. A
system using reﬂexive eye movements was developed to enable
fast authentication [45]. Saccades and ﬁxations triggered by
implicit stimuli during nornal viewing were utilized to support
continuous eye-based authentication [56]. EOG was also used
to identify the saccades and ﬁxations to differentiate users [22],
[1]. While these systems build the foundation for OcuLock,
they only focused on the gaze pattern in using smartphones
and PCs and the support of long-term performance stability has
not be validated. In this paper, we explore HVS as a whole to
utilize low-level physiological and behavioral features of HVS
triggered by immersive VR content and leverage the stability
of HVS biostructure to achieve a low variability over a two-
month evaluation.
EOG Applications. EOG has been widely used for human
computer interaction. Barea et al. [2] designed a wheelchair
system controlled by eye movements collected from EOG
signals. Chen et al. [7] developed EOG-based interfaces to
control robots. Qvarfordt et al. [42] proposed a system that
explores users’ interest based on eye-gaze patterns. Ding et
al. [10] implemented a human-computer interface using EOG
signals as input. These works validate the promise of adopting
EOG in personal computing systems. However, they do not
harness EOG as a source of information that presents unique
features of HVS. Instead, we take the ﬁrst step to utilize EOG
to explore the whole HVS for VR HMD authentication.
XII. DISCUSSION
A. Advanced Attacks
Replay attack is a common attack for biometric authenti-
cation system. In OcuLock, the authentication action is fully
covered by HMD. It is unlikely, if not impossible, for an
attacker to directly record EOG signals and replay the record
as what have been done in replay attacks for voice or face
biometric. In some cases, stronger adversaries might obtain the
owner’s EOG templates, e.g., by measuring electromagnetic
emanations while the system is processing critical information.
To spoof the system, the attackers can use two ways to feed
the stolen template into the EOG sensing system. First, the
attackers leverage the voltage generators to produce the exact
same EOG signals of the owner according to the template.
The generated signals are directly sent to the EOG electrodes
through wire connections. However, considering the ever-
growing lightweight sensors on modern VR headsets, we can
prevent it by adopting existing sensing-based or learning-based
liveness detection methods [50], [35]. Second, if the attackers
are even aware of the liveness detection, the upgraded attacking
method can be building the artiﬁcial eyes that contain all HVS
functionalities. However, such an artiﬁcial eye is currently
unavailable in the market and building it from scratch is indeed
non-trivial. Hence we do not consider it as a typical attack.
