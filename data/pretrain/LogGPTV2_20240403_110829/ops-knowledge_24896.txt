User: Please explain and differentiate between traditional virtualization and container virtualization, and list their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Traditional virtualization refers to installing a virtualization software on a server, called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), which simulates a hardware environment on which each virtual machine can install an operating system and applications. Container virtualization is virtualization at the operating system level. Multiple containers can be created on the operating system kernel. Each container has its own file system, application, and configuration, but shares a copy of the operating system kernel. The advantages of traditional virtualization include that multiple different operating systems can be run on a physical server, and resource isolation and security can be easily realized; the disadvantage is that it requires high performance and resource overhead, and the virtual machine starts slowly, which is not suitable for real-time response. and high-performance computing scenarios. The advantages of container virtualization include fast startup speed, less resource usage, and good isolation, which is suitable for deploying distributed microservice architecture and fast cloud application services; the disadvantage is that it is difficult to achieve isolation between different operating systems due to the limitation of the host operating system kernel and diversification. In addition, the isolation between containers is not thorough enough, and when a container is attacked, it will affect the entire host environment.
