If msxsl.exe is unnecessary, then block its execution to prevent abuse by
adversaries[2]                 | 1.
Monitor for:
a.
DLL/PE ﬁle events, speciﬁcally creation of these binary ﬁles as well as
the loading of DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not
recognized or not normally loaded into a process[3]
b.
execution and arguments of msxsl.exe and wmic.exe. Command
arguments used before and after the script invocation may also be
useful
in determining the origin and purpose of the payload being
loaded. The presence of msxsl.exe or other utilities that enable proxy
execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and
reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes
may be suspicious[4]
2.
Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets or accounts
3.
Routinely check ﬁrewall,
IDS,
IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual activity                   | 1.
Inventory (enumerate & assess)

Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.
Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.
Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations
5.
Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
6.
Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.
Fortify non-impacted critical assets
8.
Use signature detection to quarantine oﬀending processes[3]                           |  |  |
| 2 | (E) Eradication | (R) Recovery      | (L) Lessons/Opportunities |  |  |
| 3 | 1.
Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.
Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.
Reset any compromised passwords
4.
Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle
5.
Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle PRIOR to system recovery
6.
Patch asset vulnerabilities                 | 1.
Restore to the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) within the RTO (Recovery Time
Objective)
2.
Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.
Resolve any related security incidents
4.
Restore aﬀected systems to their last clean backup                   | 1.
Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.
Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.
Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.
Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.
Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a
chain of behavior that could lead to other activities                           |  |  |
