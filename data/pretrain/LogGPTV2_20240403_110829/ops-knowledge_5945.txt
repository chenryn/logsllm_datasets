User:  Please describe the function and principle of virtualization technology (Virtualization), and give examples of common virtualization technologies today.
Assistant: Function and principle: Virtualization technology refers to dividing a physical computer into multiple virtual computers, and each virtual computer has its own operating system, application program and hardware resources. Virtualization technology can run multiple virtualized operating systems without changing the original computer hardware configuration, thereby improving hardware utilization and system maintainability. Its principle is realized through a virtual machine monitor (VMM), which is equivalent to a virtual computer hardware platform and can provide a series of virtual hardware resources for a virtual machine. Common virtualization technologies: 1. Server virtualization: Use virtualization software such as VMware and VirtualBox to divide a physical server into multiple virtual servers to improve hardware utilization and operation and maintenance efficiency. 2. Desktop virtualization: Separate a physical host into multiple virtualized desktop environments to provide multiple virtual machine desktops that meet different user needs. 3. Storage virtualization: Through storage virtualization technology, multiple storage devices are aggregated to form a unified storage pool for application programs. 4. Network virtualization: Through SDN (Software-defined networking) technology, traditional physical network devices are virtualized into virtual network devices, so as to build, manage and apply enterprise networks more flexibly.
