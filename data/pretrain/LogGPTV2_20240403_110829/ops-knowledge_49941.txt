User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I limit concurrent sftp / port forwarding logins I have ssh set up so my users can only access sftp and port forwarding, how can I limit the number of concurrent logins on a per user basis?

In my sshd_config file, I have UsePAM set to yes, and in /etc/security/limits.conf file, I have:

username             -       maxlogins       1


I also tried:

username             hard    maxlogins       1


Neither of these works and the users can still log in multiple times.

Assistant: Surprisingly, the maxlogins directly only applies to shell logins, i.e. ones handled by sshd. (Secure SHell).  Since you are interested in SFTP / portforwarding, you'll have to use something else.

You can modify the script given at this related question to detect sftpserver processes, or scponly.  It should also work for detecting excessive port forwarding.  Unfortunately it's not as clean as a simple directive.

Script: How can I disconnect ssh users, or limit the number of ssh logins?
