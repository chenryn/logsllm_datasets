### Important Notes
- **Is flying safe?** Yes.
- **Will planes fall out of the sky after this talk?** No.
- **Is flying safe after this talk?** Yes.
- **Is some of this talk illegal?** Yes.
- **Disclaimer**: Do not attempt any of the actions discussed here.

---

### Pilots in the Audience
- Is anyone here a pilot?

---

### Our Focus
- **Not Focusing On**:
  - Airport physical security
  - Cockpit door security
  - X-Ray security
- **Focusing On**:
  - Computers used by Air Traffic Control (ATC)
  - How airplanes report their position to ATC
  - NextGen ATC

---

### Why This Topic?
- ATC is primarily focused on moving planes through the air.
- Network security of ATC equipment is often overlooked.
- The question arises: who would want to hack a radar scope?

---

### Some ATC Background
- **ATC**: Air Traffic Control
- **VOR**: VHF Omni-directional Range
- **Transponders**
- **Flight Plans**

### What is ATC?

---

### VOR
- **Definition**: VHF Omni-directional Radio Range

---

### Airplane Transponder
- Source: Wikipedia

---

### Mode-S Transponders
- **Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR)**: Paints the skin of the aircraft.
- **Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR)**: Asks the plane's transponder to send out a signal and data, time-based.
- **Unconfirmed ALT**: Gets unconfirmed altitude from the plane.
- Source: Wikipedia

---

### How do Flight Plans Work?
- **Process**:
  1. Pilot submits a requested route.
  2. Route goes into a central computer.
  3. Real flight plan gets printed out at ATC.

### Interesting Attacks in the Past
- **D.B. Cooper**
- **9/11**
- **People trying to fake their own death**

---

### Who Was D.B. Cooper?
- **Legendary Skyjacker**
- **$200,000 ransom**
- **Parachuted out the back of a 727 in flight**
- **Never found**
- Source: Wikipedia

---

### 9/11
- **Key Fact**: The hijackers turned off the transponders.
- **Mitigation**: No country-wide solution has been developed yet.
- **ADIZ in DC**: Only defense currently in place.

---

### Faking Your Own Death
- **Case Study**:
  - A pilot tried to bluff ATC about an emergency.
  - Set the plane on autopilot and parachuted out.
  - Plane was intercepted by F-16s and crashed.
  - Pilot was eventually caught.

### Proposed Attack
- **DOS on an ATC Tower**:
  1. Obtain a fake ID (illegal).
  2. Get an aviation medical using the fake ID (also illegal).
  3. Get issued a student pilot certificate with a certificate number.
  4. Log into duat.com.
  5. Create and submit multiple flight plans.
  6. All flight plans get printed at the tower.

### Radio Jamming
- **Attack Method**: Jam the ATC tower frequencies.

---

### State of Airline Insecurity
- **Overview**: A step back to look at the broader picture.

---

### FAA Insecurity
- **Report**: ATC_Web_report.pdf
- **Included on the CD**

---

### Test Results
- **Summary**: Wow!

---

### FAA Network Infrastructure
- **Critical Connection**: The connection that should never happen.

---

### IDS Sensors
- **Importance**: Who needs IDS?

---

### Leaked Data from Report
- **Document**: ATC_Web_report.pdf
- **Insight**: Now we know which networks are vulnerable.

---

### Future Directions
- **IDS Implementation**: By February 2010.
- **NextGen ATC**
- **ADS-B**

---

### NextGen ATC
- **Transition**:
  - From proprietary hardware to commercial off-the-shelf hardware.
  - Phasing out radar.
  - Airplanes' transponders will report latitude, longitude, and altitude in clear text.
  - **ADS-B**: Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast

---

### ADS-B Insecurity
- **Concerns**:
  - Unencrypted packets containing "who am I" and "where am I" information.
  - GPS as the backbone of NextGen.
  - GPS satellites failing faster than expected.
  - Potential for faking ADS-B transmissions.
  - Lack of radar to verify true positions.

---

### Call to Action
- **Listen to ATC**
- **View ADS-B broadcasts**
- **Become a Pilot**

---

### Conclusion
- **ATC Background**
- **DOS on a Tower**
- **State of Airline Security**
- **Future Directions**
- **ADS-B**
