Our Focus
 We are not going to focus on:
 Airport physical security
 Cockpit door security
 X-Ray security
 Our focus:
 Computers used by ATC
 How airplanes report their position to 
ATC
 NexGen ATC

Why?
 ATC is busy moving planes through 
the air
 ATC not focused on network 
security of equipment being used
 Who would want to hack a radar 
scope?

Mode-S Transponders
 Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR)
 Paint the skin
 Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR)
 Asks planes transponder to send out a signal 
and data, time based
 Get unconfirmed ALT from plane

How do Flight Plans Work?
 Pilot submits a requested route
 Goes into a central computer
 Real flight plan gets printed out at 
ATC

Some interesting attacks in the past
 D.B. Cooper
 9/11
 People trying to fake their own 
death

Who Was D.B. Cooper?
 Legendary Skyjacker
 $200,000
 Parachuted out the 
back of a 727 in 
flight
 Never found

9/11
 I only want to focus on one fact:
 They turned the transponder off
 We have not developed anything to 
mitigate that attack country wide
 ADIZ in DC only defense

Faking Your Own Death
 A Pilot tried to bluff ATC about an 
emergency
 Set plane on autopilot
 Parachuted out of plane
 Plane intercepted by F16s
 Plane crashed
 Pilot got caught

A DOS on an ATC Tower
1.
Get a fake ID (Of course this is 
illegal)
2.
Get an aviation medical using fake 
id (also illegal)
3.
Get issued a student pilot 
certificate with certificate number
4.
Log into duat.com
5.
Create multiple flight plans and 
submit
6.
All flight plans get printed at tower

 NextGen ATC

NextGen ATC
 Converting from proprietary 
hardware to commercial off the 
shelf hardware
 Phasing out radar
 Airplanes transponder will report 
Lat., Long., and Alt. in clear txt
 ADS-B

ADS-B Insecurity
 Who am I and where am I in one 
unencrypted packet
 GPS will be the backbone of 
NextGen
 Oh, and GPS sats are failing faster than 
expected
 One could easily fake an ADS-B 
transmission
 No radar to verify true position
