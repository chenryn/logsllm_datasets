### Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

Currently, it appears that the application requires a full restart to apply changes to environmental variables, such as the `PATH`. Simply opening a new "cmd" tab does not reflect these changes.

To address this, I propose adding an option to refresh the environmental variables when a new "cmd" tab is opened. Alternatively, a "Refresh Environmental Variables" entry could be added to the drop-down menu. This would allow users to update the environmental variables without needing to restart the entire application, enhancing usability and efficiency.
