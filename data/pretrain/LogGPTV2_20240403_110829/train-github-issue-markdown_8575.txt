# Description of the new feature/enhancement
It seems that I have to restart the application to apply changed environmental
variables (such as PATH). Opening a new "cmd" tab did not reflect the changes.
How about adding an option to read environmental variables again when opening
a new "cmd" tab? Or a "Refresh environmental variables" entry in the drop-down
menu.
