lation to create a national ﬁrearms registry, in response to the
Christchurch shooting. Within the United States, California,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, and
New York currently have ﬁrearm registration requirements for
some subset of ﬁrearms, depending on the state [19].
Cryptographic building blocks. Our encrypted registry sys-
tem relies on secure computation, secret sharing and structured
encryption. Secure two-party computation was introduced by
Yao [52] and secure multi-party computation by by Gold-
wasser, Micali and Wigderson [28]. Formal deﬁnitions of
security for MPC in the standalone setting were given by
Canetti
in [13]. Secret sharing was introduced by Shamir
in [45]. We also make use of structured encryption and,
speciﬁcally, of dictionary, multi-map and (NoSQL) database
encryption schemes. Structured encryption was introduced
by Chase and Kamara as a generalization of indexed-based
symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) constructions [22].
SSE was introduced by Song, Wagner and Perrig [46] and
formalized by Curtmola et al. [22]. In the standard setting
of structured encryption (STE), the client encrypts its data,
stores it in on an untrusted server, and performs queries on
the encrypted structure. In this work, however, the client also
needs the ability to allow other parties to query its encrypted
data. This multi-user setting considered in [22], [29], [42],
[43].
Federated encrypted databases. Our system has some su-
perﬁcial similarities to federated encrypted databases like

the US is Los Angeles county with a population of 10 million. Assuming an
average of 5 guns per person, this county would have 50 million guns

Conclave [49] and SMSQL [6]. These are systems that also
leverage MPC to privately query multiple databases. Their
goal, however, is to support private queries on the union of
disjoint databases, each of which is held by different parties.
On the other hand, in our setting, queries are executed over a
single local database (after it has been found using the global
dictionary). Furthermore, in our system, 2PC and MPC are
not used to process the databases but, roughly speaking, to
generate tokens that, in turn, are used to query the STE-
encrypted databases. To summarize, our system is designed
to enable a party to efﬁciently ﬁnd the local database it needs
to query, whereas federated encrypted databases are designed
to query the union of multiple databases owned by different
parties.
III. PRELIMINARIES
Notation. The set of all binary strings of length n is denoted
as {0, 1}n, and the set of all ﬁnite binary strings as {0, 1}∗.
The output y of an algorithm A on input x is denoted by x ←
A(x). When we wish to make A’s random coins r explicit,
we write y ← A(x; r). Given a sequence s of n elements, we
refer to its ith element as si. If S is a set then #S refers to its
cardinality. Throughout, k will denote the security parameter.
Dictionaries & multi-maps. A dictionary DX with capacity n
is a collection of n label/value pairs {((cid:96)i, vi)}i≤n and supports
get and put operations. We write vi
:= DX[(cid:96)i] to denote
getting the value associated with label (cid:96)i and DX[(cid:96)i] := vi
to denote the operation of associating the value vi in DX with
label (cid:96)i. A multi-map MM with capacity n is a collection of
n label/tuple pairs {((cid:96)i, vi)i}i≤n that supports Get and Put
operations. We write vi := MM[(cid:96)i] to denote getting the tuple
associated with label (cid:96)i and MM[(cid:96)i] := vi to denote operation
of associating the tuple vi to label (cid:96)i. Multi-maps are the
abstract data type instantiated by an inverted index. In the
encrypted search literature multi-maps are sometimes referred
to as indexes, databases or tuple-sets (T-sets).
Document databases. A document database DB of size n
holds n records {r1, . . . , rn} each of which is a collection
of ﬁeld/value pairs ﬁeld:value. Here, we consider databases
that support boolean queries, i.e., queries of the form ϕ =
(cid:0)ﬁeld1 = value1 ∧ ﬁeld2 = value2 ∨ ﬁeld3 = value3
(cid:1).
Basic cryptographic primitives. A symmetric-key encryption
scheme is a set of three polynomial-time algorithms SKE =
(Gen, Enc, Dec) such that Gen is a probabilistic algorithm that
takes a security parameter k and returns a secret key K;
Enc is a probabilistic algorithm that takes a key K and a
message m and returns a ciphertext c; Dec is a deterministic
algorithm that takes a key K and a ciphertext c and returns m
if K was the key under which c was produced. Informally,
a private-key encryption scheme is secure against chosen-
plaintext attacks (CPA) if the ciphertexts it outputs do not
reveal any partial information about the plaintext even to an
adversary that can adaptively query an encryption oracle. In
addition to encryption schemes, we also make use of pseudo-
random functions (PRF), which are polynomial-time com-
putable functions that cannot be distinguished from random
functions by any probabilistic polynomial-time adversary. We
refer the reader to [35] for formal security deﬁnitions.
Secret sharing. A threshold secret sharing scheme SS =
(Share, Recover) consists of two efﬁcient algorithms [45].
Share takes as input a secret s, a threshold t and total number
of shares n and outputs n shares s1, . . . , sn. Recover takes
as input t out of n shares and outputs s. A secret sharing
scheme SS is secure if no efﬁcient adversary can learn any
partial information about the secret s given any set of r < t
shares. We refer the reader to [25] for formal deﬁnitions.
Secure multi-party computation. Secure multi-party com-
putation [52] allows n parties to securely compute a function
over their joint inputs without revealing any information about
their inputs beyond what can inferred from the output. In our
work, we make use of two-party secure computation (2PC) and
of multi-party secure computation (MPC). For modularity and
conciseness, we describe our protocol in the (F f
MPC)-
hybrid model which functions like a real-world protocol
execution except that all parties also have access to ideal
2PC and MPC functionalities denoted by F f
MPC.
We only consider security against semi-honest adversaries so,
in practice, these ideal functionalities can be instantiated with
standard semi-honest two-party and multi-party protocols. We
refer the reader to [25] for an overview of MPC and standard
security deﬁnitions.

(Init, Token, Query, AddToken, Add, Resolve)
structures DS consists of six efﬁcient algorithms. Init takes
as input a security parameter 1k and outputs an encrypted
dictionary EDS and a secret key K. Token takes as input a
key K and a query q and outputs a token tk. Query takes as
input an encrypted structure EDS and a token tk and outputs
a ciphertext ct. AddToken takes as input a key K and an
update u and outputs an add token atk. Add takes as input an
encrypted structure EDS and an add token atk and outputs a
(cid:48). Resolve takes as input a key
new encrypted structure EDS
K and a ciphertext ct and outputs a value v.
In this work, we also rely on STE schemes that include a
ResKey algorithm that takes as input a secret key K and a
query q and outputs a restricted key Kq which can be used to
resolve the encryption of v. We refer to such schemes as STE
schemes with restricted resolve.
Security. There are two adversarial models for STE: persistent
adversaries and snapshot adversaries. A persistent adversary
observes: (1) the encrypted data; and (2) the transcripts of the
interaction between the client and the server when a query is
made. A snapshot adversary, on the other hand, only receives
the encrypted data after a query has been executed. Persistent
adversaries capture situations in which the server is completely
compromised whereas snapshot adversaries capture situations

where the attacker recovers only a snapshot of the server’s
memory.
The security of STE is
formalized using “leakage-
parameterized” deﬁnitions following [20], [22]. In this frame-
work, a design is proven secure with respect to a security
deﬁnition that is parameterized with a speciﬁc leakage proﬁle.
Leakage-parameterized deﬁnitions for persistent adversaries
were given in [20], [22] and for snapshot adversaries in [5].2
The leakage proﬁle of a scheme captures the information
an adversary learns about the data and/or the queries. Each
operation on the encrypted data structure is associated with
a set of leakage patterns and this collections of sets forms
the scheme’s leakage proﬁle. We recall the informal security
deﬁnition for STE and refer the reader to [5], [20], [22] for
more details.
Deﬁnition III.1 (Security vs. persistent adversary (Infor-
mal)). Let Λ = (cid:0)LS,LQ,LU
(cid:1) = (cid:0)patt1, patt2, patt3
(cid:1) be
a leakage proﬁle. A structured encryption scheme STE for
data structures DS is Λ-secure if there exists a PPT simula-
tor that, given patt1(DS) for an adversarially-chosen struc-
ture DS, patt2(DS, q1, . . . , qt) for adaptively-chosen queries
(q1, . . . , qt), and patt3(DS, u1, . . . , ut) for adaptively-chosen
updates (u1, . . . , ut) can simulate the view of any PPT adver-
sary. Here, the view includes the encrypted data structure and
the tokens of the queries.
Encrypted dictionaries & multi-maps. When the data struc-
ture DS in the deﬁnitions above is a dictionary, then ΣDX
is a dictionary encryption scheme. Similarly, if DS above is
a multi-map then ΣMM is a multi-map encryption scheme.
Also, note that dictionary encryption schemes are a special
case of multi-map encryption schemes since dictionaries are
just multi-maps with single-item tuples. There are many well-
known practical multi-map encryption schemes that achieve
different
tradeoffs between query and storage complexity,
leakage and efﬁciency [5], [10], [11], [16], [17], [17], [22],
[24], [27], [31]–[34], [44], [47]. We note that all these con-
structions either implicitly have a ResKey algorithm or can
be trivially modiﬁed to have one. From a security point of
view, we require that, given a value v, one can simulate a
ciphertext ct and a key KR such that Resolve(KR, ct) outputs
v and that the ciphertexts output by Query be computationally
indistinguishable form random. Again, these properties are
trivially achievable by the mentioned schemes.
Encrypted document databases. Encrypted multi-maps can
be combined with standard symmetric encryption to yield an
encrypted document database. This is equivalent to the notion
of index-based searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). For
completeness we recall the details in Appendix A.
2Even though parameterized deﬁnitions were introduced in the context
of SSE and STE, they can be (and have been) applied to other primitives,
including to fully-homomorphic encryption, property-preserving encryption,
oblivious RAM, secure multi-party computation and functional encryption.
IV. OVERVIEW OF LEGISLATION
Our design is based directly on legislation that
is cur-
rently being drafted by Sen. Wyden’s ofﬁce. This proposal
envisions a national ﬁrearm registry instantiated as a system
of distributed, decentralized, and locally managed encrypted
databases. The following details and requirements strictly
come from drafted legislation.
Under this system, each county in the United States stores li-
cense and registration data in its own database. Each State then
operates a server, which stores and maintains the availability
of all of county databases corresponding to the state. The state
server should not have any other responsibility outside of this
role and does not act as a authorized user of the system nor
should it have access to any of the data it stores.
In order to ensure the security and privacy of the data, each
county designates a local ofﬁcial who is responsible for an
encryption key. This key is required in order to view, query,
update, and encrypt any registration data corresponding to
the county. No additional parties may access any licensing
or registration data from a county without this key. The local
ofﬁcial must also upload any new licensing or registration data
to the system.
Authorized users of the system include, but are not limited
to, other local county ofﬁcials, law enforcement personnel,
and ﬁrearm distributors. These individuals are permitted to
query the system for registration and licensing data but may
not delete or update this data, unless they are the county’s des-
ignated local ofﬁcial. At minimum the data collected includes
basic personal information about a licensed ﬁrearm owner,
including their license number, and information about their
individual ﬁrearms (speciﬁcally, the make, model, caliber, and
serial number). The legislation dictates that bulk queries (in the
sense of being overly broad) and attempts at collecting large
amounts of information from the system must be prohibited
and reported. The system must therefore have some means of
rate limiting queries while protecting the privacy of the data.
Given that different regions in the United States differ in
infrastructure and have varying levels of Internet connectivity,
the legislation makes an explicit requirement that authorized
users must be able to make queries, even if the key held by
the county’s local ofﬁcial is ofﬂine. Ofﬂine access, however,
must be bounded by some predetermined time. Once the key
has been ofﬂine beyond this time, any data pertaining to
this county should be entirely inaccessible. Another important
feature of the system is that counties should have the ability
to retract their database from the system at any point.
The system is voluntary in the sense that States can elect
to participate by operating a server and counties can elect
to participate by storing a database within the State server.
This allows for local laws to dictate participation and ac-
commodates for changes to those laws, if a state or county’s
constituents choose to later opt out of the system, without
affecting the ability for other states or counties to participate.
To understand the type of data collected, we additionally
reviewed existing ﬁrearm registration forms from New York

[41], Washington D.C. [39], and the ATF [12]. Ultimately in
our empirical evaluation, we based our sample record off of the
minimum data requirements from this draft legislation since it
contained the intersection of common attributes among these
forms. Throughout this process, we have been in conversation
with Sen. Wyden’s ofﬁce in order to understand the priorities
of the legislation and the infrastructure constraints that must
be accounted for when designing a system across counties in
all 50 states. In our evaluation, we speciﬁcally chose virtual
machines that would reﬂect the different resources available at
the state and county level. Based on feedback from their ofﬁce,
we also explicitly included a cost analysis in our evaluation to
understand the monetary feasibility of running a system like
this at scale.
V. PROTOCOL
In this
section we describe the design of our en-
crypted registry system and its usage. The protocol
Ω = (InitGlobal, InitLocal, Add, Find, Query, OﬄineQuery)
consists of six protocols which we describe at a high-level
below. We provide in Appendix C the detailed pseudo-code
of the protocol (see Figures 5 and 6 in the Appendix). We
stress that the protocol we propose is one of many possible
ways to instantiate the requirements outlined in Section IV but
that this design received positive feedback from members of
the team responsible for drafting the legislation.
Parties. The system is designed to be executed among: a large
(constant) number of parties P1, . . . , Pθ, three backups B(i)
1 ,
B(i)
for each party Pi, two custodians C1 and C2,
2
and a server S. While the legislation envisions that every
state hosts a server for its counties, in our model we only
include a single server S for ease of exposition and because
it captures the worst-case scenario from a security point of
