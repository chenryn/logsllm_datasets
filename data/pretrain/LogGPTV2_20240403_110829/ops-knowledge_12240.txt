User: I have installed two different python versions (3.1 and 2,7) And this is now causing a headache. The default installation is the 3.1 which have the PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH set. Problem is that when I try to run scons from the 2.7 installation (via Python27/Scripts/scons.bat) I get various import errors that reference to the Python31/lib/ folder.
Are there any good solutions for this, except changing PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH for the whole system. Shouldn't scons be able to work with two versions of python installed?
Not sure if this is a SuperUser or a SO question, but my guess that most people experienced with Python and Scons hangs here, and not in SU.
Assistant: Try to set PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH in the scons.bat scripts to the right values for each Python installation respectively.
