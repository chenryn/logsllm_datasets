### Issue with `tabIndex` Typing in `ChipProps`

#### Description
The TypeScript typings for `ChipProps` include a `tabIndex` property of type `number | string`. This is incompatible with the `tabIndex` property inherited from `HTMLElement` via `HTMLDivElement`, which expects a `number`.

#### Expected Behavior
- The `tabIndex` property in the `ChipProps` interface should either be of type `number` or removed entirely, as it is already inherited from the base `HTMLAttributes` interface.

#### Current Behavior
- When compiling, the following error is encountered:
  ```
  ERROR in /node_modules/material-ui/Chip/Chip.d.ts(4,18):
  error TS2430: Interface 'ChipProps' incorrectly extends interface 'HTMLAttributes'.
  Types of property 'tabIndex' are incompatible. Type 'ReactText' (which includes 'string') is not assignable to type 'number'.
  ```

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Add the `Chip` component to any TypeScript project.
2. Compile the project using `tsc`.

#### Environment
- **Material-UI**: 1.0.0-beta.9
- **React**: 15.6.1

#### Additional Notes
- I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
