Typscript typings for ChipProps includes tabIndex of type: number | string
which is incompartible with the overriding tabIndex property extended from
HTMLElement via HTMLDivElement.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
No error. Property tabIndex?: number | string on interface ChipProps should
either be tabIndex?: number or removed completely since its inherited by
virtue of extension.
## Current Behavior
Receive the error message  
`ERROR in /node_modules/material-ui/Chip/Chip.d.ts
(4,18): error TS2430: Interface 'ChipProps' incorrectly extends interface
'HTMLAttributes'. Types of property 'tabIndex' are
incompatible. Type 'ReactText' is not assignable to type 'number'. Type
'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Add Chip to any typescript project and compile with tsc
