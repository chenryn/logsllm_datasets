The primary objectives of clustering algorithms in ad hoc wireless networks are to:
1. Enable scalable communication as the number of nodes increases.
2. Manage node mobility effectively [7].

In a cluster-based ad hoc wireless network, scalability is achieved through a two-tiered communication architecture: intra-cluster and inter-cluster communications (as shown in Figure 1(a) and 1(b), respectively). Each cluster can be visualized as a unit disk with a radius equal to the transmission range of the Cluster Head (CH). This structure inherently forms a clique, where any node within the cluster can communicate directly or via the CH, ensuring efficient local communication. 

Only CHs and Gateways (GWs) participate in inter-cluster communication, which makes system-wide information dissemination more efficient compared to flat flooding.

### Clustering Algorithm Overview

A typical clustering algorithm begins with a distributed clusterhead selection process. Nodes use heartbeat diffusion to probe their one-hop neighborhood. A node \( v \) identifies itself as a CH if it meets a qualifying policy, such as having the lowest Node ID (NID) within its one-hop neighborhood. The CH and its neighbors form a cluster. Nodes that can hear from multiple CHs qualify as GWs, facilitating inter-cluster communication. Multiple clusters can form simultaneously, and the clustering process may continue iteratively until all nodes, except isolated ones, are affiliated with clusters.

### Our Cluster-Formation Algorithm

Our cluster-formation algorithm [16] builds on previous work [15, 7] and offers several unique features:

1. **Partial Overlap and Robust Connectivity:**
   - The algorithm ensures that clusters partially overlap, allowing GWs to connect directly to multiple CHs.
   - It increases the likelihood of having multiple gateway candidates, enhancing robustness.

2. **Deputy Clusterheads and Backup Gateways:**
   - The algorithm leverages high population density to create Deputy Clusterheads (DCHs) and Backup Gateways (BGWs).
   - This setup improves resilience against both node and link failures.

3. **Gateway Affiliation:**
   - Unlike previous algorithms, our approach ensures each GW is affiliated with one and only one cluster, preventing ambiguity in failure detection.

4. **Open-Ended Iteration:**
   - The algorithm does not specify an explicit termination rule for cluster formation, allowing it to handle newly arriving hosts in the same manner as existing unaffiliated nodes.

5. **Integration with Failure Detection Service (FDS):**
   - After the initial cluster formation, the first round of the FDS is integrated with the clustering algorithm.
   - Both marked and unmarked nodes transmit heartbeats at each heartbeat interval, serving multiple purposes:
     - Marked nodes participate in local FDS.
     - Unmarked nodes within established clusters but not yet recognized by CHs can subscribe to the group membership service.
     - Unmarked nodes outside clusters trigger additional cluster formation.

### Failure Detection Service (FDS)

#### 4.1 Completeness and Accuracy

Extensive research has led to well-defined completeness and accuracy properties for abstract failure detector models [13, 14]. For ad hoc networks, we aim to provide probabilistic guarantees for these properties:

- **Completeness:** Every node failure will be reported to every operational node.
- **Accuracy:** No operational node will be suspected by other operational nodes.

Operational nodes are those that are neither crashed nor partitioned from the network. Due to message loss, deterministic accuracy is challenging, but the clustering approach facilitates probabilistic accuracy. By executing the FDS locally in each cluster and forwarding results only when a failure is detected, the problem is simplified. Reducing false detection at the local level enhances system-level accuracy.

Similarly, achieving probabilistic completeness requires ensuring that failure reports:
1. Reach every member of the cluster where the failure is detected.
2. Traverse the backbone to reach every CH.
3. Reach all cluster members via their CHs through inter-cluster communication.

#### 4.2 Localized Failure Detection

During cluster formation, a self-elected CH identifies cluster members and broadcasts a cluster organization announcement. Each cluster member then has an initial view of the local membership, and the CH knows which nodes to expect during FDS execution. The FDS executes at the start of each heartbeat interval and consists of the following rounds:

1. **Heartbeat Exchange (fds.R-1):**
   - Every node in the cluster sends a heartbeat message to the CH, containing the senderâ€™s NID and a mark indicator.
   - The CH broadcasts its heartbeat, which is heard by all cluster members.
   - Non-CH nodes broadcast to their one-hop neighbors, creating a heartbeat diffusion.

2. **Digest Exchange (fds.R-2):**
   - Each node sends a digest to the CH, listing the nodes from which it received or overheard heartbeats.
   - The CH broadcasts its digest to all cluster members, resulting in a digest diffusion.

3. **Health-Status-Update Broadcast (fds.R-3):**
   - The CH analyzes the collected heartbeat and digest information to identify failed nodes.
   - It broadcasts an update on the cluster health status, indicating any newly detected failed nodes.

**Failure Detection Rule:**
- A node \( v \) is determined to have failed if:
  1. The CH receives neither \( v \)'s heartbeat nor its digest.
  2. None of the digests reflect awareness of \( v \)'s heartbeat.

**CH-Failure Detection Rule:**
- A CH is judged to have failed if:
  1. The DCH receives neither the CH's heartbeat nor its digest.
  2. None of the digests reflect awareness of the CH's heartbeat.
  3. The DCH does not receive the health status update from the CH.

False detection due to message loss is rare due to the exploitation of time, spatial, and message redundancies. After a CH failure, the DCH takes over and broadcasts the health status update.

### Intra-Cluster Completeness Enhancement

While fds.R-3 lacks redundancy, potential completeness issues can arise if some nodes do not receive the failure update. Additionally, after a CH failure, the DCH may not reach all cluster members. To address these issues, we enhance intra-cluster completeness by leveraging inherent message redundancy, as illustrated in Figure 2. Digest collection in fds.R-2 significantly reduces the probability of missed updates, even for nodes out of the DCH's transmission range.

By integrating these features, our algorithm ensures robust and reliable failure detection in ad hoc wireless networks.
