User: How to use AWS Elastic Load Balancer to achieve application load balancing, and provide implementation steps and precautions.
Assistant: Implementation steps: 1. Create an Elastic Load Balancer: Create an Elastic Load Balancer in the AWS console. During the creation process, you need to select the availability zone, protocol, listening port, and target group. Target groups point to EC2 instances or Auto Scaling groups. 2. Configure health checks: ELB will periodically perform health checks on the instances in the target group. If an instance is marked as unhealthy, the ELB will not route traffic to that instance. You can choose to manually configure the health check, or you can use the AWS default health check. 3. Configure the load balancer: adjust the performance of the Elastic Load Balancer by removing instances or expanding instances through configuration. Scale up instances to ensure that requests are distributed evenly. Notes: 1. Instances must be added to the same Subnet, otherwise ELB will not be able to evenly distribute traffic to the instances. 2. The instance must be configured with a security group to ensure that the ELB can forward traffic to each instance. 3. The load balancer may initially filter instances that respond slowly. These instances are marked as unhealthy. Adjust the health check settings to make sure this is properly addressed here. 4. CloudWatch can be used to monitor ELB to avoid over budget or performance issues. 5. The load balancer will become the failure bottleneck of the system. If you accidentally set up a large volume of traffic and incremental upload or download requests, consider multiple load balancers or use a more advanced implementation such as Auto Scaling.
