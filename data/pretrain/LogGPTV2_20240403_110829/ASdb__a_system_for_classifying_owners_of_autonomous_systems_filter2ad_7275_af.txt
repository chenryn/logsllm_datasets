Table 11: Category-based (layer 1) Precision and Coverage for External Data Sources—At least one data source achieves a 100%
precision on 11 out of 16 NAICSlite categories on the Uniform Gold Standard set. When using the intersection of at least two data sources that
agree on classification—occurring in only 33% of ASes in the Uniform Gold Standard—nearly all NAICSlite categories achieve 100% precision.
In the Gold Standard set, 60% of ASes have two sources which agree on a classification, and overall precision is 96%. The denominators of the
provided fractions denote coverage. Note that given their relatively poor coverage and performance in comparison to other data sources (as
well as prohibitive cost) we drop ZoomInfo and Clearbit from our evaluation.
