ABSTRACT
For more than a decade, unsolicited trafﬁc sent to unused regions
of the address space has provided valuable insight into malicious
Internet activities. In this paper, we explore the utility of this traf-
ﬁc, known as Internet Background Radiation (IBR), for a differ-
ent purpose: as a data source of Internet-wide measurements. We
collect and analyze IBR from two large darknets, carefully decon-
structing its various components and characterizing them along di-
mensions applicable to Internet-wide measurements.
Intuitively,
IBR can provide insight into network properties when trafﬁc from
that network contains relevant information and is of sufﬁcient vol-
ume. We turn this intuition into a scientiﬁc investigation, examin-
ing which networks send IBR, identifying components of IBR that
enable opportunistic network inferences, and characterizing the fre-
quency and granularity of trafﬁc sources. We also consider the in-
ﬂuences of time of collection and position in the address space on
our results. We leverage IBR properties in three case studies to
show that IBR can supplement existing techniques by improving
coverage and/or diversity of analyzable networks while reducing
measurement overhead. Our main contribution is a new framework
for understanding the circumstances and properties for which unso-
licited trafﬁc is an appropriate data source for inference of macro-
scopic Internet properties, which can help other researchers assess
its utility for a given study.

unused regions of the address space, known as Internet Background
Radiation (IBR), to address this challenge.
Monitoring unused portions of the IPv4 address space reveals
that IBR is of considerable volume, incessant, and originates from
a variety of services [41, 48]. This unsolicited trafﬁc is caused by
scanning (e.g., searching for hosts running a vulnerable service),
misconﬁgurations (e.g., a typo in the IP address for a mail server),
backscatter (responses to packets with forged source IP addresses,
including spoofed DoS attack), bugs, etc. Historically, researchers
have used this trafﬁc to study worms, DoS attacks, and scanning.
More recently, instead of studying malicious activities, researchers
have leveraged IBR to learn about hosts and networks generating
unsolicited trafﬁc [12,15,20,22,24,32,44]. The pervasively sourced
components of IBR make a darknet—a region of the address space
exclusively dedicated to collecting IBR—the potential recipient of
trafﬁc from all networks connected to the global Internet: botnets
employ machines worldwide to perform scans; misconﬁgurations
can occur in any network; and many networks host services that
are potential victims of DoS attacks (causing backscatter). Casado
et al. [15] ﬁrst proposed using IBR (and other types of “spurious”
network trafﬁc, such as SPAM emails) to illuminate regions of the
address space where traditional techniques fail to provide visibility
(e.g., in the presence of NAT). Recent studies of censorship events,
IPv4 address space utilization, and ﬁltering policies have veriﬁed
this beneﬁt [22, 24, 44].
However, these studies focused on isolated events or speciﬁc
components of IBR. It is unclear if the same analysis techniques
work on similar events or with different collections of IBR (e.g.,
using different times or IBR vantage points). More broadly, these
studies do not provide insight into which properties are amenable
to analysis using IBR and whether the networks themselves must
have certain characteristics to allow IBR-based inferences.
To evaluate IBR’s utility as an Internet-wide data source, we be-
gin by evaluating properties that support opportunistically measur-
ing many networks. In Section 4, we quantify the large number and
diversity of sources, which facilitate insight into many networks. In
Section 5, we analyze the components of IBR, through which we
can glean considerable information from packet-level data (e.g., the
operating system from TCP options).
In Section 6, we evaluate
IBR’s persistent nature, which permits repeated observations and
often predictable temporal behavior.
In the context of inferring global properties of Internet networks,
IBR also has fundamental limitations and challenges. Although
IBR originates from many sources, we lack control over who sends
it and when. In particular, the mix of popular applications changes
regularly [41], which reduces the predictability of IBR. Addition-
ally, IBR is unidirectional; since a darknet does not respond to un-
solicited trafﬁc we cannot infer ﬂow-level information. Moreover,
packets with spoofed source addresses will lead to inaccurate infer-
ences; as a result, IBR needs to be sanitized. Section 3 provides a
summary of our sanitization technique, which we previously veri-
ﬁed [22].
The case studies we present in Section 8 highlight the strengths
and weaknesses of using IBR as a data source for Internet-wide
measurement. Our experience suggests that IBR is useful:
(1)
When the presence of a source in darknet trafﬁc provides additional
context. For example, although we ﬁnd fewer open resolvers than
active probing, we know that attackers are actively using the ones
found in IBR. (2) To obtain a large sample. We could easily cal-
culate uptime for over half-a-million sources, to determine that a
common technique for inferring uptime is invalid for certain oper-
ating systems. (3) For hosts unreachable through active probing.
We can determine the uptime for NATed clients, which are unlikely
to respond to external probes. (4) To reduce measurement over-
head. We can identify ﬂapping and non-ﬂapping routes without
sending packets. Such an analysis could focus active probing on
routes that have recently changed.
2. RELATED WORK
We are far from the ﬁrst to analyize Internet Background Ra-
diation. Pang et al. performed the ﬁrst major characterization of
IBR [41], with the aim of identifying and ﬁltering out malicious
trafﬁc. Brownlee detected new activities in IBR based on inter-
arrival time [14], while Wustrow et al. examined IBR from multiple
darknets over several years to discover which destination addresses
received a disproportionate amount of IBR, which is useful before
assigning IP addresses [48]. We have different goals than these
prior characterizations of IBR, however, leading us to consider dif-
ferent aspects: we ask “who sends IBR?” and “how often do we re-
ceive IBR?” instead of “why do we receive IBR?” or “where is IBR
destined?” In particular, we focus on the quantity and frequency of
sources sending IBR instead of the volume of packets or bytes. For
this reason, another difference from previous IBR characterization
studies is that we remove spoofed packets from IBR before per-
forming our analyses (spoofed source IP addresses represent fake
sources).
There have been a number papers that use IBR to provide proof-
of-concept of a measurement technique [12,20–22,24], or examine
the applicability of a certain type of trafﬁc to Internet-wide mea-
surement [32, 44]. The primary goal of our three case studies is
not to lengthen this list, but to demonstrate the effects of IBR’s na-
ture on our ability to extract Internet-wide properties. Casado et al.
considered (but did not quantify) the nature of unsolicited trafﬁc in
their proposal for its utilization in opportunistic measurement [15].
However, this paper provides a more comprehensive view of IBR
as a measurement data source. We put other related work into this
framework in Table 4.
3. DATASETS
Our primary datasets are collections of IBR. To assist in analyz-
ing IBR, we also use a mapping of IP addresses to preﬁxes, ASes
and geographic locations, and a classiﬁcation of the types of Au-
tonomous Systems (ASes).
IBR Trafﬁc. A darknet or network telescope is a collection of
routed but unused IP addresses, i.e., all trafﬁc these addresses re-
ceive is unsolicited. Darknets capture—but do not respond to—
IBR. Both UC San Diego and Merit Network operate large dark-
nets, which we call UCSD-NT and MERIT-NT respectively. UCSD-
NT observes trafﬁc destined to more than 99% of IP addresses in
a contiguous /8 block. MERIT-NT covers about 67% of a different
/8 block.
We study packet traces captured from July 31 to September 2,
2012 and July 23, 2013 to August 25, 2013. We choose these time
periods because they align with the ICMP-ping based census con-
duced by ISI [29]. We refer to these 34-day periods as the 2012
census and 2013 census, respectively. We label our datasets based
on the collection site and the year: UCSD-12, UCSD-13, and
MERIT-13 (which are 5.1, 4.0 and 1.5 TB of compressed data,
respectively). To perform a longitudinal analysis spanning several
years, in Section 7.1 we also use ﬂow-level datasets—a summary
of pcap data (i.e., protocol, source IP, destination IP, source port,
destination port, ﬂags, TTL, and number of packets)—collected by
UCSD-NT from April 2008 to January 2015.
We use two darknets to study how position within the address
space inﬂuences our results. Comparing UCSD-NT and MERIT-
NT is not straightforward since the darknets are different sizes. For
a fair comparison, we construct the dataset partial-UCSD-13,
which is the trafﬁc to a subset of IP addresses in UCSD’s dark-
net. Speciﬁcally, we include trafﬁc to an IP address UCSD.B.C.D
if the IP address MERIT.B.C.D is part of MERIT-NT. As a result,
approximately the same number1 of destination IP addresses con-
tributes to partial-UCSD-13 and MERIT-13. We explore dif-
ferences between UCSD-12 and UCSD-13 to study how the time
of collection inﬂuences our results.
Including spoofed IBR trafﬁc, i.e., trafﬁc with a forged source
IP, in our analyses would likely lead to incorrect inferences. We
apply previously published techniques [22] to obtain a list of un-
routed networks and remove spoofed trafﬁc from the pcap datasets.
The primary technique identiﬁes spikes in unrouted addresses ob-
served per hour. From these spikes we develop heuristics to exclude
spoofed trafﬁc. The heuristics also remove almost all trafﬁc with
source IP addresses in known dark blocks, providing validation (the
validation results of “de-spooﬁng” in UCSD-12 and UCSD-13 are
available elsewhere [21, 22]). As a result, we reduce the number
of /24 blocks that appear to send us trafﬁc from ≈10M to ≈3M.
As a ﬁnal step, we exclude all trafﬁc from unrouted IP addresses,
which may exist due to failed egress ﬁltering by remote networks
or spoofed sources missed by our heuristics. We apply similar tech-
niques to the ﬂow-level data spanning several years.
Preﬁxes. To analyze networks at the preﬁx level, we map source
IP addresses to BGP announced preﬁxes. We consider a preﬁx an-
nounced if, on the ﬁrst day of the dataset, it is visible by 95% of
the ASes peering—and providing a full routing table—with Route-
views and RIPE RIS collectors, based on RIB data.2 For each IP
address we use the most-speciﬁc preﬁx.
Autonomous Systems. We use CAIDA’s Preﬁx-to-AS mapping
dataset (pfx2as) to map IPv4 addresses to AS numbers [10]. CAIDA
extracts this dataset from BGP announcements captured by Route-
views. Speciﬁcally, we use the mapping produced on the ﬁrst day
of the IBR datasets. To label ASes as transit/access providers, con-
tent providers, or enterprise networks, we use a dataset provided
by CAIDA developed using a scheme similar to that proposed by
Dhamdhere and Dovrolis [25].
Geolocation. We use historical MaxMind country-level databases
to geolocate the .0 address of each /24 block in our IBR datasets.
Since MaxMind updates the database regularly (to reﬂect changes
in the address space), we use the databases produced on August 1,
2012 and August 16, 2013 for the 2012 census and 2013 census
periods, respectively.
1A handful of IP addresses in UCSD-NT’s /8 matching the
MERIT.B.C.D criterion are not darknet addresses.
2 We choose the same threshold as previous work [36].
