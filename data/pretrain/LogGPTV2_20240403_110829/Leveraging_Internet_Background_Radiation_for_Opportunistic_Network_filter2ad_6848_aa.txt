## Abstract
For over a decade, unsolicited traffic sent to unused regions of the address space has provided valuable insights into malicious Internet activities. In this paper, we explore the utility of this traffic, known as Internet Background Radiation (IBR), for a different purpose: as a data source for Internet-wide measurements. We collect and analyze IBR from two large darknets, carefully deconstructing its various components and characterizing them along dimensions applicable to Internet-wide measurements.

Intuitively, IBR can provide insight into network properties when traffic from that network contains relevant information and is of sufficient volume. We turn this intuition into a scientific investigation, examining which networks send IBR, identifying components of IBR that enable opportunistic network inferences, and characterizing the frequency and granularity of traffic sources. We also consider the influences of the time of collection and position in the address space on our results. We leverage IBR properties in three case studies to show that IBR can supplement existing techniques by improving coverage and/or diversity of analyzable networks while reducing measurement overhead. Our main contribution is a new framework for understanding the circumstances and properties for which unsolicited traffic is an appropriate data source for inference of macroscopic Internet properties, which can help other researchers assess its utility for a given study.

## 1. Introduction
Obtaining data from a diverse set of hosts and networks is a major challenge in Internet measurement research. We explore the potential of an unconventional data source, unsolicited traffic sent to unused regions of the address space, known as Internet Background Radiation (IBR), to address this challenge.

Monitoring unused portions of the IPv4 address space reveals that IBR is of considerable volume, incessant, and originates from a variety of services. This unsolicited traffic is caused by scanning (e.g., searching for hosts running a vulnerable service), misconfigurations (e.g., a typo in the IP address for a mail server), backscatter (responses to packets with forged source IP addresses, including spoofed DoS attacks), bugs, etc. Historically, researchers have used this traffic to study worms, DoS attacks, and scanning. More recently, instead of studying malicious activities, researchers have leveraged IBR to learn about hosts and networks generating unsolicited traffic. The pervasively sourced components of IBR make a darknet—a region of the address space exclusively dedicated to collecting IBR—the potential recipient of traffic from all networks connected to the global Internet: botnets employ machines worldwide to perform scans; misconfigurations can occur in any network; and many networks host services that are potential victims of DoS attacks (causing backscatter). Casado et al. first proposed using IBR (and other types of "spurious" network traffic, such as SPAM emails) to illuminate regions of the address space where traditional techniques fail to provide visibility (e.g., in the presence of NAT). Recent studies of censorship events, IPv4 address space utilization, and filtering policies have verified this benefit.

However, these studies focused on isolated events or specific components of IBR. It is unclear if the same analysis techniques work on similar events or with different collections of IBR (e.g., using different times or IBR vantage points). More broadly, these studies do not provide insight into which properties are amenable to analysis using IBR and whether the networks themselves must have certain characteristics to allow IBR-based inferences.

To evaluate IBR’s utility as an Internet-wide data source, we begin by evaluating properties that support opportunistically measuring many networks. In Section 4, we quantify the large number and diversity of sources, which facilitate insight into many networks. In Section 5, we analyze the components of IBR, through which we can glean considerable information from packet-level data (e.g., the operating system from TCP options). In Section 6, we evaluate IBR’s persistent nature, which permits repeated observations and often predictable temporal behavior.

In the context of inferring global properties of Internet networks, IBR also has fundamental limitations and challenges. Although IBR originates from many sources, we lack control over who sends it and when. In particular, the mix of popular applications changes regularly, which reduces the predictability of IBR. Additionally, IBR is unidirectional; since a darknet does not respond to unsolicited traffic, we cannot infer flow-level information. Moreover, packets with spoofed source addresses will lead to inaccurate inferences; as a result, IBR needs to be sanitized. Section 3 provides a summary of our sanitization technique, which we previously verified.

The case studies we present in Section 8 highlight the strengths and weaknesses of using IBR as a data source for Internet-wide measurement. Our experience suggests that IBR is useful:
1. When the presence of a source in darknet traffic provides additional context. For example, although we find fewer open resolvers than active probing, we know that attackers are actively using the ones found in IBR.
2. To obtain a large sample. We could easily calculate uptime for over half-a-million sources, to determine that a common technique for inferring uptime is invalid for certain operating systems.
3. For hosts unreachable through active probing. We can determine the uptime for NATed clients, which are unlikely to respond to external probes.
4. To reduce measurement overhead. We can identify flapping and non-flapping routes without sending packets. Such an analysis could focus active probing on routes that have recently changed.

## 2. Related Work
We are far from the first to analyze Internet Background Radiation. Pang et al. performed the first major characterization of IBR, with the aim of identifying and filtering out malicious traffic. Brownlee detected new activities in IBR based on inter-arrival time, while Wustrow et al. examined IBR from multiple darknets over several years to discover which destination addresses received a disproportionate amount of IBR, which is useful before assigning IP addresses. We have different goals than these prior characterizations of IBR, leading us to consider different aspects: we ask "who sends IBR?" and "how often do we receive IBR?" instead of "why do we receive IBR?" or "where is IBR destined?" In particular, we focus on the quantity and frequency of sources sending IBR instead of the volume of packets or bytes. For this reason, another difference from previous IBR characterization studies is that we remove spoofed packets from IBR before performing our analyses (spoofed source IP addresses represent fake sources).

There have been several papers that use IBR to provide proof-of-concept of a measurement technique, or examine the applicability of a certain type of traffic to Internet-wide measurement. The primary goal of our three case studies is not to lengthen this list, but to demonstrate the effects of IBR’s nature on our ability to extract Internet-wide properties. Casado et al. considered (but did not quantify) the nature of unsolicited traffic in their proposal for its utilization in opportunistic measurement. However, this paper provides a more comprehensive view of IBR as a measurement data source. We put other related work into this framework in Table 4.

## 3. Datasets
Our primary datasets are collections of IBR. To assist in analyzing IBR, we also use a mapping of IP addresses to prefixes, ASes, and geographic locations, and a classification of the types of Autonomous Systems (ASes).

### IBR Traffic
A darknet or network telescope is a collection of routed but unused IP addresses, i.e., all traffic these addresses receive is unsolicited. Darknets capture—but do not respond to—IBR. Both UC San Diego and Merit Network operate large darknets, which we call UCSD-NT and MERIT-NT, respectively. UCSD-NT observes traffic destined to more than 99% of IP addresses in a contiguous /8 block. MERIT-NT covers about 67% of a different /8 block.

We study packet traces captured from July 31 to September 2, 2012, and July 23, 2013, to August 25, 2013. We choose these time periods because they align with the ICMP-ping-based census conducted by ISI. We refer to these 34-day periods as the 2012 census and 2013 census, respectively. We label our datasets based on the collection site and the year: UCSD-12, UCSD-13, and MERIT-13 (which are 5.1, 4.0, and 1.5 TB of compressed data, respectively). To perform a longitudinal analysis spanning several years, in Section 7.1, we also use flow-level datasets—a summary of pcap data (i.e., protocol, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, flags, TTL, and number of packets)—collected by UCSD-NT from April 2008 to January 2015.

We use two darknets to study how position within the address space influences our results. Comparing UCSD-NT and MERIT-NT is not straightforward since the darknets are different sizes. For a fair comparison, we construct the dataset partial-UCSD-13, which is the traffic to a subset of IP addresses in UCSD’s darknet. Specifically, we include traffic to an IP address UCSD.B.C.D if the IP address MERIT.B.C.D is part of MERIT-NT. As a result, approximately the same number of destination IP addresses contribute to partial-UCSD-13 and MERIT-13. We explore differences between UCSD-12 and UCSD-13 to study how the time of collection influences our results.

Including spoofed IBR traffic, i.e., traffic with a forged source IP, in our analyses would likely lead to incorrect inferences. We apply previously published techniques to obtain a list of unrouted networks and remove spoofed traffic from the pcap datasets. The primary technique identifies spikes in unrouted addresses observed per hour. From these spikes, we develop heuristics to exclude spoofed traffic. The heuristics also remove almost all traffic with source IP addresses in known dark blocks, providing validation. As a result, we reduce the number of /24 blocks that appear to send us traffic from ≈10M to ≈3M. As a final step, we exclude all traffic from unrouted IP addresses, which may exist due to failed egress filtering by remote networks or spoofed sources missed by our heuristics. We apply similar techniques to the flow-level data spanning several years.

### Prefixes
To analyze networks at the prefix level, we map source IP addresses to BGP-announced prefixes. We consider a prefix announced if, on the first day of the dataset, it is visible by 95% of the ASes peering—and providing a full routing table—with Routeviews and RIPE RIS collectors, based on RIB data. For each IP address, we use the most-specific prefix.

### Autonomous Systems
We use CAIDA’s Prefix-to-AS mapping dataset (pfx2as) to map IPv4 addresses to AS numbers. CAIDA extracts this dataset from BGP announcements captured by Routeviews. Specifically, we use the mapping produced on the first day of the IBR datasets. To label ASes as transit/access providers, content providers, or enterprise networks, we use a dataset provided by CAIDA developed using a scheme similar to that proposed by Dhamdhere and Dovrolis.

### Geolocation
We use historical MaxMind country-level databases to geolocate the .0 address of each /24 block in our IBR datasets. Since MaxMind updates the database regularly (to reflect changes in the address space), we use the databases produced on August 1, 2012, and August 16, 2013, for the 2012 census and 2013 census periods, respectively.

| Dataset | Announced | 2012 | 2013 |
|---------|-----------|------|------|
| **IP Addresses** | 2.61B | 2.66B | 148M (5.7%) | 133M (5.0%) | 109M (4.1%) | 111M (4.2%) |
| **/24 Blocks** | 10.2M | 10.4M | 3.13M (31%) | 3.15M (30%) | 2.65M (26%) | 2.76M (27%) |
| **Prefixes** | 175k (39%) | - | - | - | - | - |
| **ASes** | 46k | 24.3k (55%) | 24.2k (54%) | 19.3k (44%) | 19.8k (45%) | - |
| **Countries** | 236 | 232 (98%) | 410k | 452k | 44k | 245 |
| **Observed ASes** | 198k (48%) | 205k (45%) | 170k (38%) | 234 (96%) | 233 (99%) | 231 (98%) |

Table 1: The number (and percentage of announced resources) of IP addresses, /24 blocks, prefixes, ASes, and countries observed in each dataset is consistent across sites (UCSD-NT vs. MERIT-NT) and years (2012 vs. 2013).
