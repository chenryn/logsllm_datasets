It sounds like you're encountering an issue while trying to run Twisted example code using the `twistd` command. The error message indicates that the `twistd` command is unable to find a variable named `application` in your `.tac` file, which is required for the application to run.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed and professional way to address your problem:

### Problem Description
You are attempting to run Twisted example code, but it crashes when using the `twistd` command instead of `python`. Specifically, you are seeing a `KeyError: 'application'` error, indicating that the `twistd` command cannot find the `application` variable in your `.tac` file.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Ensure the Correct File Format**:
   - When using `twistd`, you need to have a `.tac` (Twisted Application Configuration) file. This file should define an `application` object.
   - Ensure that your `.tac` file contains the following structure:
     ```python
     from twisted.application import service, internet
     from twisted.internet.protocol import Factory
     from echoserv import EchoFactory  # Assuming this is your protocol factory

     # Create the application object
     application = service.Application("EchoServer")

     # Define the service
     echo_service = internet.TCPServer(8000, EchoFactory())
     echo_service.setServiceParent(application)
     ```

2. **Check the Command Syntax**:
   - The correct command to run your `.tac` file with `twistd` is:
     ```sh
     twistd -ny echoserv.tac
     ```
   - Note that the file extension should be `.tac` and not `.py`.

3. **Verify the File Content**:
   - Open your `echoserv.tac` file and ensure it contains the `application` variable as shown in the example above.
   - If your file is named `echoserv.py`, you need to rename it to `echoserv.tac` or create a new `.tac` file with the appropriate content.

4. **Read the Documentation**:
   - For more details, refer to the Twisted documentation, specifically the "Using Application" HOWTO, which provides comprehensive information on creating and running Twisted applications.
   - You can find the documentation [here](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/application.html).

5. **Environment and Version Compatibility**:
   - You mentioned using Python 2.7.2 and Twisted versions 11.0.0 and 12.0.0. While these versions are quite old, they should generally work if the `.tac` file is correctly configured.
   - Consider updating to a more recent version of Python and Twisted if possible, as they may offer better support and fewer bugs.

### Example of a Correct `.tac` File
Here is a complete example of a `.tac` file for a simple echo server:

```python
from twisted.application import service, internet
from twisted.internet.protocol import Factory
from echoserv import EchoFactory  # Replace with the actual import path

# Create the application object
application = service.Application("EchoServer")

# Define the service
echo_service = internet.TCPServer(8000, EchoFactory())
echo_service.setServiceParent(application)
```

### Summary
- Ensure your `.tac` file defines the `application` variable.
- Use the correct command syntax: `twistd -ny echoserv.tac`.
- Refer to the Twisted documentation for more details.
- Consider updating to more recent versions of Python and Twisted.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully run your Twisted application.
