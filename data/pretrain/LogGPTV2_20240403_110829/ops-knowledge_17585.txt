User: I am trying to use twisted but when i try to run some of the example code provided with the twisted package, it seems to always crash when i use "twistd" instead of "python"
for example, using the example code given with twisted, 
if i run to command : twisted -ny echoserv.py
Unhandled Error

Failed to load application: 'application'
Could not find 'application' in the file. To use 'twistd -y', your .tac
file must create a suitable object (e.g., by calling service.Application())
and store it in a variable named 'application'. twistd loads your .tac file
and scans the global variables for one of this name.

Please read the 'Using Application' HOWTO for details.



I was using Twisted version 11.0.0 but then i tried 12.0.0 but i have the same problem.
The version of python i am using is 2.7.2
Any ideas on what to do would be helpful. I have been trying to deal with this problem for a few days now. thanks!
