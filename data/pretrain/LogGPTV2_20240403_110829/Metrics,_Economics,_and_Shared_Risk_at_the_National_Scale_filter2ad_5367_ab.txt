### Mandatory Reporting of Communicable Diseases and the Role of the CDC

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) play a critical role in managing public health, including the mandatory reporting of communicable diseases. This system enables longitudinal analysis of disease incidence and prevalence, facilitating the identification of excess cases or outbreaks. The CDC also deploys specialized teams to manage and contain disease outbreaks.

The CDC is established and funded through legal frameworks and tax revenue. While it was not present at the inception of modern public health systems, it has become an essential component. Key questions arise regarding the extent to which the rule of law should mandate reporting, enforce treatment, and implement quarantine measures. Additionally, the publication of comprehensive reports, such as an internet-equivalent of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), and the formal prediction of epidemics, whether for influenza or other pathogens, are crucial. Publicly identifying areas with high disease incidence or prevalence is also a significant aspect of their work.

### Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)

ISACs were established under Presidential Decision Directive #63 in 1998. Each ISAC is sector-specific, covering areas such as financial services, information technology, energy, and electric power. These centers are voluntary associations of private and public entities that report to a sector coordinator, who in turn reports to a relevant cabinet-level department, such as the Treasury for the Financial Services ISAC.

Data sharing within ISACs is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and antitrust laws. The data is shared in a nominally anonymous manner, more akin to unattributed rather than truly anonymous. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks to take over these ISACs, raising concerns about the balance between government control and private sector autonomy in protecting critical infrastructure.

### Regulatory Information Sharing

Regulatory sharing is a form of information exchange, particularly around disclosure. California's Senate Bill #1386 (SB1386) mandates that firms disclose when they may have lost personally identifiable data. Similar laws exist in other states, such as Idaho, New York, New Jersey, Georgia, and Indiana. Other regulatory examples include the FTC Safeguards Rule, which requires due care in handling data, and the Federal Information Systems Management Act (FISMA).

### Metrics and Security

Metrics for security are not straightforward. Process-based metrics are effective only in stable attack environments, which is not the case in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Damping down change to achieve stability is a policy question. Goal-based metrics, on the other hand, must be indirect because security is a means, not an end. An ordinal scale may suffice, but the adequacy of this approach is debatable.

### Ends vs. Means: Security and Reliability

If a system is insecure, it is unreliable. Therefore, security is necessary for reliability, though it is insufficient on its own. As systems mature, security becomes a subset of reliability. Similarly, regulation is necessary for predictability, but it is also insufficient. The challenge is to regulate for predictability without stifling innovation or the motivation to improve.

### Security Spending

Security spending is a significant concern. Richard Berner, Chief US Economist at Morgan Stanley, noted that increased security spend could consume the entire productivity growth of the US economy over the next decade. This would erase the "peace dividend" and crowd out other investments.

### Calibrating Security Spend

The Meta Group recommends that IT budgets allocate 5% to security, with specific allocations for hardware, software, services, and staff. For example, manufacturing might allocate 3%, while banks might allocate 8%.

### The Value of Information

Information is often more valuable than the hardware that processes it. To determine the value of information, one can consider replacement value, black market prices, and future value. For instance, building a brand from scratch, the cost of continuity breaks, and the value of intellectual property like patents and proprietary algorithms.

### Pre-emption and Surveillance

Pre-emption against invisible threats requires intelligence and surveillance. This necessitates a sensor fabric that is always on, shifting the default from freedom (permit) to safety (deny). The social and economic costs of such surveillance are significant.

### Data Illustration

To illustrate these points, we can look at the number of known incidents, vulnerabilities, and hosts. The product of hosts and vulnerabilities can model the total number of open holes, showing a steep increase in opportunities for exploitation. This data helps in understanding the scale of the problem and the need for robust security measures.
