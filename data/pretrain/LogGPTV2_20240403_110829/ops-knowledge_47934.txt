User: I have installed the new python release and would like to run .py files from the terminal.
How is this done from the terminal? I dont want to include the path in each command to run a .py file.
Assistant: Since you have installed a working python, the easiest way to run python files from the terminal is to cd your terminal to the directory where the file is located and then just type python my_code.py in the terminal.
