All Our Powers Combined
Connecting Academics, Engineers, and Hackers
Security
Centered around conferences (DEFCON, HITCON, etc), CTF, and open-source 
projects.
Full of students, hackers, etc.
Labor of love.
Striving for fulfillment.
Enthusiast Community
Enthusiasts
Operates primarily out of university research labs.
Full of professors, postdocs, PhD researchers.
Labor of love + overhead.
Striving for innovation.
Academic Community
Enthusiasts
Academia
Operates primarily out of for-profit companies.
Full of brilliant engineers, hackers, etc.
Labor of love + profit.
Striving for usefulness.

Why?
Why me?
Created at UIUC in 2000.
Open-sourced in 2003.
Adopted by Apple in 2005.
Continued use by academia and industry.
Nested success stories in spin-off projects!

Complications Arise
Research?
Academic meaning: invention, 
innovation, or understanding 
(novel research).
Industry meaning: finding bugs in 
software (vulnerability research).
Industry research...
-
finding a new bug
-
developing a new technique
-
developing a new tool
-
actionable results
Academic research...
-
finding a new class of bug
-
developing a new technique
-
applying a technique in a new way
-
demonstrating potential
Academics must present at academic conferences to survive.
-
constant need for novelty => short attention span
-
papers become very hard to approach
Different goals of “research” limit interactions.
-
little cross-attendance between academic conferences, industry conferences, and enthusiast 
conferences
This causes friction.
-
Tweet wars (printf turing-completeness, Cloak&Dagger, symbolic execution)
-
Duplicated effort.
Terminology differences — Effects
Better interaction venues:
-
USENIX WOOT (Workshop on Offensive Technologies)
-
USENIX Enigma
-
CSAW
-
NDSS BAR (Binary Analysis Research) Workshop
More cross-pollination of ideas.
-
internships to industry, engineers going back to grad school
Assume good faith!
-
Example: Cloak & Dagger
Terminology differences — Solutions?
Come to the BAR!
Paper deadline: Dec 15, 2017
Workshop: Feb 18, 2018
Audience:
-
Academics
-
Industry
-
Enthusiasts (CTFers and tool builders)
Explicitly includes a disucssion session!

Academic prototypes...
-
written by graduate 
students under 
extreme deadlines
-
minimalistic 
demonstration of 
concept
-
completely 
unsupported or 
undocumented
Industry prototypes...
-
written by 
professionals
-
well-designed
-
well-documented
-
decently supported
Enthusiast prototypes...
-
written by some 
random hacker
-
often 
better-supported than 
academic prototypes
Documentation seems...
-
very important for enthusiasts
-
moderately important for industry people
-
slightly important for academics
Functionality seems...
-
very important for industry
-
moderately important for enthusiasts
-
slightly important for academics
(This is a bad feedback mechanism...)
angr Observations
There is hope for angr!
-
increasingly effective community support on slack
-
perseverance by enthusiast community members
-
continued adoption (and adaptation) by industry
But what about the general case?
-
In the US: NSF Transition To Practice grants
-
Google Summer of Code, Mozilla Open Source Grants, etc
-
Idea: “community service” homework, such as documentation.

The Real World
CTF means different things to different people.
-
an incredible test of skill
-
an awesome opportunity to stay capable and relevant
-
an irrelevant game where kids play with toys
-
a waste of time
CTF takes time.
-
hard for industry
-
either ignored or actively discouraged by many professors!
CTF
It is up to us in decision-making roles to support CTF.
-
CTF is a first-order priority at ASU.
More participants in industry and academia should strive for leadership positions 
in CTF.
Also, problem is resolving itself...
-
academics noticed Shellphish in the CGC.
-
CTFers dominating pwn2own, etc.
CTF         — Solutions?
Conclusion —
Overall Solutions
Talk with each other.
Learn from each other.
Do better with community integration.
Ask?

If a grad school or visiting internship is something that interests you, let me know!
Communities have different motivations for collaboration.
Academics:  reproducibility, impact, but need better incentives
Industry: profit motive
Enthusiasts: enthusiasm
Pull Request ghosting — deciding partway through the implementation of a pull 
request that your company wants to keep the modifications proprietary.
Workarounds?
-
moving target (Linux kernel)
-
GPL (other drawbacks)
