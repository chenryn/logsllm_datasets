#### Research Perspectives
- **Academic Research:**
  - **Definition:** Invention, innovation, or understanding through novel research.
  - **Goals:** Discovering new classes of bugs, developing new techniques, and demonstrating potential.
  - **Requirements:** Presenting at academic conferences to maintain relevance and funding.
  - **Challenges:** Constant need for novelty, leading to complex and hard-to-approach papers.
- **Industry Research:**
  - **Definition:** Finding bugs in software (vulnerability research).
  - **Goals:** Identifying new bugs, developing new tools, and achieving actionable results.
  - **Challenges:** Limited cross-attendance between academic and industry conferences, leading to duplicated efforts and misunderstandings.

#### Friction and Solutions
- **Friction Points:**
  - **Tweet Wars:** Disagreements over topics like printf turing-completeness and symbolic execution.
  - **Duplicated Efforts:** Lack of communication leads to redundant work.
- **Better Interaction Venues:**
  - **USENIX WOOT (Workshop on Offensive Technologies):** Fosters collaboration between academics, industry, and enthusiasts.
  - **USENIX Enigma, CSAW, NDSS BAR (Binary Analysis Research) Workshop:** Provide platforms for cross-pollination of ideas.
- **Cross-Pollination:**
  - **Internships and Grad School:** Encouraging internships and professionals returning to graduate school.
  - **Assume Good Faith:** Example: Cloak & Dagger, where good faith assumptions led to better outcomes.

#### Terminology and Documentation
- **Documentation Importance:**
  - **Enthusiasts:** Very important.
  - **Industry:** Moderately important.
  - **Academia:** Slightly important.
- **Functionality Importance:**
  - **Industry:** Very important.
  - **Enthusiasts:** Moderately important.
  - **Academia:** Slightly important.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** The current system often fails to provide effective feedback, leading to suboptimal results.

#### angr Observations
- **Community Support:** Increasingly effective support on Slack, perseverance by enthusiasts, and continued adoption by industry.
- **General Case Solutions:**
  - **NSF Transition To Practice Grants:** Funding for transitioning academic research to practical applications.
  - **Google Summer of Code, Mozilla Open Source Grants:** Additional funding and support for open-source projects.
  - **Community Service Homework:** Encouraging tasks like documentation as part of coursework.

#### CTF and Its Role
- **Perceptions:**
  - **Skill Test:** An incredible test of skill.
  - **Opportunity:** A chance to stay capable and relevant.
  - **Criticism:** Seen by some as an irrelevant game or a waste of time.
- **Challenges:**
  - **Time Constraints:** Difficult for industry professionals.
  - **Academic Attitudes:** Often ignored or discouraged by professors.
- **Solutions:**
  - **Leadership Roles:** More participants in industry and academia should take on leadership roles in CTF.
  - **Recognition:** Academics have noticed the impact of CTF, such as Shellphish in the Cyber Grand Challenge and CTFers dominating pwn2own.

#### Conclusion
- **Overall Solutions:**
  - **Communication:** Talk with each other and learn from each other.
  - **Community Integration:** Improve integration and collaboration across communities.
