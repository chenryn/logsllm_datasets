To extract the relevant information from the log entry using a Grok expression, you can use the following pattern:

```
%{MONTHDAY} %{HOUR}:%{MINUTE}:%{SECOND} %{HOSTNAME:hostname} %{DATA:program}\[%{NUMBER:PID}\]: Connection closed by %{IP:client_ip} \[preauth\]
```

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the components:
- `%{MONTHDAY}`: Matches the day of the month (e.g., "10").
- `%{HOUR}:%{MINUTE}:%{SECOND}`: Matches the time in the format `HH:MM:SS` (e.g., "06:55:48").
- `%{HOSTNAME:hostname}`: Matches the hostname (e.g., "LabSZ").
- `%{DATA:program}\[%{NUMBER:PID}\]`: Matches the program name and its PID (e.g., "sshd[24200]").
- `Connection closed by %{IP:client_ip} \[preauth\]`: Matches the specific message, including the client IP address (e.g., "173.234.31.186 [preauth]").

This Grok expression will help you parse and extract the necessary fields from the log entry.
