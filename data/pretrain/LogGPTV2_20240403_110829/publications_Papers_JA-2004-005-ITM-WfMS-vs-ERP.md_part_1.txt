### Abstract

Two critical classes of information systems, Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, have been widely used to support e-business process redesign, integration, and management. While both technologies facilitate business process automation, data transfer, and information sharing, their technological approaches and features differ significantly. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of these two classes of information systems in both industry and academia, which hinders their effective application. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between WfMSs and ERP systems, discussing how they can be used independently or in conjunction to develop intra- and inter-organizational solutions. Additionally, we explore the roles of WfMSs and ERP systems in the next generation of IT architecture based on web services. Our findings should help businesses make informed decisions regarding the adoption of WfMSs and ERP systems in their e-business strategies.

**Keywords:** Workflow Management System, Enterprise Resource Planning Systems, Enterprise Application Integration, Business Process Management.

### Introduction

Modern enterprise infrastructure and organization require robust support for critical business processes. As business processes are the fundamental building blocks of an organization's success, information technologies that focus on process management and improvement are essential for fulfilling corporate visions and enhancing competitive positions. Over the past two decades, special attention has been given to two distinct solutions: Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.

Both WfMSs and ERP systems focus on business processes but employ different approaches. A WfMS is based on a process specification and execution paradigm (Figure 1(a)). It first creates a workflow model to specify organizational business processes, and then workflow instances are generated to execute the steps described in the model. During execution, workflow instances can access legacy systems, databases, applications, and interact with users.

In contrast, ERP systems are built around prefabricated applications (Figure 1(b)). To better align these applications with organizational needs, ERP systems must be configured by setting various parameters. The more parameters an ERP application has, the more flexible it is in configuring business processes. However, the workflow model in conventional ERP systems is not explicitly specified; it is embedded in the applications and parameter tables.

Figure 1 illustrates one of the key differences between WfMSs and ERP systems. Understanding these differences can be facilitated by distinguishing between flow logic and function logic. Function logic deals with specific tasks, such as updating a customer record or calculating order discounts, while flow logic combines multiple functions in a sequence to solve complex problems, such as processing an order. In ERP systems, both flow and function logic are embedded in applications and parameter tables. In contrast, WfMSs explicitly separate the two. Flow logic is captured in a graphical workflow model, and function logic is handled by the applications, data, and people invoked by the model. Thus, WfMSs enable developers to manage the flow among system components (applications, data, people) separately from the workflow model. WfMSs are process-centric, focusing on managing flow logic, while ERP systems are data-centric, focusing on managing function logic through a common, homogeneous data infrastructure across the organization to support multiple applications.

We can use the analogy of programming languages to illustrate this difference. Working with a WfMS is similar to programming in a non-procedural high-level language, where developers work directly with a graphical representation of the business workflow model. The WfMS development platform then generates the necessary application components and database linkages to execute the workflow. Working with ERP systems is like working with a 3rd generation procedural language, where it is necessary to deal directly with applications and data.

Recently, ERP vendors have begun integrating WfMSs into their systems to facilitate customization and deployment. For example, Baan acquired COSA and integrated its standalone workflow system into its ERP solution. Oracle has added a WfMS that allows self-service ERP applications to be integrated into various workflows, automatically processing and routing information, supporting personalized business rules, and modeling and maintaining business processes using a graphical workflow builder. These integrative approaches leverage the strengths of both technologies.

This paper analyzes the similarities and differences between WfMSs and ERP systems, which is crucial because both technologies play significant roles in current and future organizational capabilities for managing business processes within and across organizations. As more companies adopt a process-centric approach to application management, these technologies will become increasingly indispensable.

One issue is that ERP and WfMS technologies are often managed by different groups within an organization, leading to a lack of understanding and communication between these groups. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of integration in academic institutions, where ERP teaching and research are primarily conducted in Information Systems Departments within Colleges of Business, while WfMS teaching and research are mostly done in Computer Science Departments within Colleges of Arts and Science. There is a need for a holistic view of these two technologies in both business and academic organizations.

The paper is organized as follows:
- **Section 1:** Presents the technological evolution of the systems.
- **Section 2:** Compares the two systems on three dimensions: domain scope, technological scope, and system implementation.
- **Section 3:** Discusses how the two types of systems can be used independently and together to address intra- and inter-organizational application integration.
- **Section 4:** Addresses the implications of our analysis on research and education.
- **Section 5:** Concludes and summarizes the key findings.

### 1. Systems Evolution and Maturity

The evolution of WfMSs and ERP systems has followed distinct trajectories, and both are at different levels of maturity. ERP systems have found stronger acceptance and deployment worldwide compared to WfMSs.

Workflow management systems emerged in the 1980s, but some consensus suggests that office information systems (OIS), an important field in the 1970s, are their predecessors. The first OIS prototypes were developed in the late 1970s, including the SCOOP project, which aimed to automate office procedures, and Officetalk, which provided a visual electronic desktop metaphor and personal productivity tools for information manipulation and sharing.

In the 1980s, due to several failures in office automation projects, interest in OIS declined, and research shifted towards flexible groupware systems. WfMSs were introduced during this period. Advances in transaction processing and integrated office systems made workflow systems popular in the 1990s. While Alonso et al. noted their innovation and popularity, WfMSs had not yet matured into a well-proven and stable technology. Research prototypes included METEOR, MOBILE, ADEPT, and Exotica, and commercial products included IBM MQSeries Workflow, Staffware, TIBCO InConcert, and COSA Workflow. General information on WfMSs can be found at the websites of the Workflow and Reengineering International Association and the Workflow Management Coalition.

Historically, the origin of ERP systems can be traced back to the 1960s, when organizational information systems focused on handling traditional inventories. In the 1970s, the focus shifted to material requirements planning (MRP), which helped translate master production schedules into raw material requirements. In the 1980s, the concept of MRP-II emerged, optimizing entire plant production processes. Technological advances enabled the development of software systems to manage functional areas such as finance and human resources, leading to the implementation of Blumenthal's integrated architecture and framework, which can be seen as the foundation of ERP systems. Today, various ERP systems are available, including Baan, CSC, JD Edwards, Oracle, PeopleSoft, and SAP. General information on ERP systems can be found at TechRepublic’s website.

By analyzing the historical evolution and maturity of the two systems, we observe that ERP systems evolved steadily from the 1960s to a high point in the mid-to-late 1990s, with major success stories globally. This progressive evolution led to a trusted and well-known product in the industry, with high credibility, a strong market position, and a significant advantage over competitors. Furthermore, ERP systems were in a mature state when organizations needed to solve critical problems, such as the Y2K problem and the replacement of outdated legacy systems.

The stronger acceptance of ERP systems is reflected in industry buying patterns. According to Aberdeen Group's estimates, spending in the Business Process Management software sector (which includes workflow systems) reached $2.26 billion in 2001. In comparison, ERP systems revenue was $21.5 billion in 2000, according to IDC. The cycles of popularity of OIS and WfMSs in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s generated confusion among managers and end-users, leading to reluctance in adopting workflow systems. However, WfMSs are expected to play a key role in future efforts, especially in systems integration. This paper aims to clarify this confusion by comparing the systems and discussing their future roles.

### 2. WfMS and ERP Systems

Considering the evolution and maturity paths of the systems, we now turn our attention to the conceptual differences between WfMSs and ERP systems. Our goal is not to provide a comprehensive analysis of all factors involved in selecting and implementing these systems, which is beyond the scope of a single paper. Instead, we focus on the major differences in the technologies themselves and what they can do for a business. We compare the two technologies along three main dimensions: domain scope, technological scope, and system implementation. Each dimension highlights key differences in the systems, summarized in Table 1.

| **Dimension** | **WfMS** | **ERP Systems** |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Domain Scope** | Customized processes | Embedded processes with some customization |
|                | Domain independence | Domain specific |
|                | Ad-hoc and dynamic domains | Static domains |
|                | No international settings | International settings |
| **Technological Scope** | Process-centric | Data-centric |
|                        | Supports workflows involving humans, IT applications, and transactional workflows | Transactional workflows |
|                        | Homogeneous environments with common data infrastructures |
