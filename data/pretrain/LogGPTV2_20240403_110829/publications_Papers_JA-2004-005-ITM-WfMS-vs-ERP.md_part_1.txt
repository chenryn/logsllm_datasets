Abstract. Two important classes of information systems, Workflow Management Systems
(WfMSs) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, have been used to support e-
business process redesign, integration, and management. While both technologies can help with
business process automation, data transfer, and information sharing, the technological approach
and features of solutions provided by WfMS and ERP are different. Currently, there is a lack of
understanding of these two classes of information systems in the industry and academia, thus
hindering their effective applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison
between these two classes of systems. We discuss how the two types of systems can be used
independently or together to develop intra- and inter-organizational application solutions. In
particular, we also explore the roles of WfMS and ERP in the next generation of IT architecture
based on web services. Our findings should help businesses make better decisions in the
adoption of both WfMS and ERP in their e-business strategies.
Keywords: Workflow Management System, Enterprise Resource Planning Systems, Enterprise

Introduction
Today’s enterprise infrastructure and organization require the support of critical business
processes. Since business processes are the fundamental building blocks of an organization’s
success, information technologies that focus on process management and improvement have
been good candidates to help organizations to fulfill their corporate visions and to improve their
competitive positions. In the past two decades, special interest has been given to two distinct
solutions that improve business processes: Workflow Management and Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) systems.

Figure 1. WfMS and ERP systems
Both classes of systems focus on business processes, but the approaches taken by them are
different. A WfMS is implemented based on a process specification and execution paradigm
(Figure 1 (a)). Under a WfMS, a workflow model is first created to specify organizational
business processes, and then workflow instances are created to carry out the actual steps
described in the workflow model. During the workflow execution, the workflow instances can
access legacy systems, databases, applications, and can interact with users.
ERP systems are implemented around the idea of prefabricated applications as shown in
Figure 1 (b). To achieve better “fit” between the prefabricated applications and the needs of the
organization, ERP systems must be configured by setting various application parameters. The
more parameters an ERP application has, the more flexibility in configuring the business
process. However, the workflow model in conventional ERP systems is not explicitly specified
because it is embedded in the applications and the parameter tables.
Figure 1 represents one of the key differences between WfMS and ERP systems. One way to
better understand these differences is to distinguish between flow logic and function logic.
Function logic deals with a specific task, such as updating a customer record or calculating order
discounts, while flow logic deals with combining many functions in some sequence to solve
more complex problems such as processing an order. In ERP systems, flow logic and function
logic are both embedded in applications and parameter tables. In contrast, a WfMS separates the
two explicitly. Flow logic is captured in a workflow model, usually graphically represented, and
3
function logic is captured in the applications, data, and people the model invokes. Thus, a WfMS
enable developers to separate the flows among a system’s components (applications, data,
people) from the workflow model. Workflow systems are process-centric, focusing on the
management of flow logic. On the other hand, ERP systems are data-centric, focusing on
managing function logic via a common homogeneous data infrastructure across the organization
to support multiple applications.
We can use the analogy with programming languages to illustrate this difference. Working
with a WfMS is similar to programming in a non-procedural high-level language where
developers are working directly with a graphical representation of the business workflow model.
The WfMS development platform then generates necessary application components, database
linkages, etc. to execute a workflow process. Working with ERP systems is like working with a
3rd generation procedural language, where it is necessary to deal directly with applications and
data.
The recent trend from ERP vendors is to integrate a WfMS into ERP systems. For example, in
order to facilitate the customization and deployment of ERP systems, some vendors are making
their systems workflow-driven with the integration of workflow components. For example, Baan
bought COSA [1] and integrated the COSA stand-alone workflow system into its ERP solution.
Oracle has added a WfMS that allows any of its self-service ERP applications to be integrated in
various workflows that automatically process and route information, support personalized
business rules, and model and maintain business processes using a graphical workflow builder.
These integrative approaches take advantage of the strengths of both technologies.
This paper analyzes the similarities and differences between WfMS and ERP systems, which
is important because both technologies have a major role to play in the current and future
organizational capabilities to manage business processes within and across organizations. As
more and more companies are switching to a process-centric approach to application
management, these technologies will become increasingly indispensable.
One of the problems is that ERP and WfMS technologies are often managed by different
groups within an organization. There is often little understanding of the other group’s technology
and little communication between groups. This problem is propagated by the lack of integration
in academic institutions. ERP teaching and research is mainly done in Information Systems
Departments within Colleges of Business, while WfMS teaching and research is mostly done in
Computer Science Departments within Colleges of Arts and Science. There is a need for these
two technology camps in both business and academic organizations to have a holistic view of
these two technologies.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 presents the technological evolution of the
systems. In section 2, the two systems are compared on three dimensions: domain scope,
technological scope, and system implementation. Section 3 discusses how the two types of
systems can be used independently and together to address intra- and inter-organizational
application integration. Section 4 addresses implications of our analysis on research and
education. Finally, section 5 presents our conclusions and summarizes the key findings.
1 Systems Evolution and Maturity
The evolution of WfMS and ERP systems has taken two distinct trajectories, and further, both
are presently at different levels of maturity. For instance, ERP systems have found stronger
acceptance and deployment around the world than WfMS.

Workflow management systems appeared in the 80’s, but there is some consensus that the
office information systems (OIS) field, an important field in the 70’s, is the predecessor of
workflow systems [2]. The first OIS prototypes were developed in the late seventies. The pioneer
systems included the SCOOP project [3], which was oriented to the automation of office
procedures, and Officetalk [4], which provided a visual electronic desktop metaphor, a set of
personal productivity tools for manipulating information, and a network environment for sharing
information.
In the 80’s, due to several failures in office automation projects and installations [5], interest in
office information systems declined, and research efforts were redirected towards flexible
groupware systems and models [6]. WfMSs were initially introduced during this time period.
Advances in transaction processing and integrated office systems made workflow systems
popular in the 90’s. While Alonso et al. [7] pointed out that they were innovative and had gained
a high level of popularity, WfMS had not yet matured into a well-proven and stable technology.
Research prototypes include METEOR [8], MOBILE [9], ADEPT [10], and Exotica [11];
commercial products include IBM MQSeries Workflow, Staffware, TIBCO InConcert, and
COSA Workflow. General information on WfMSs can be found at the web sites of the Workflow
and Reengineering International Association [12] and the Workflow Management Coalition [13].
Historically, the origin of ERP systems can be traced back to the 60’s when the focus of
organizational information systems was mainly on handling traditional inventories. In the 70’s,
the systems focused on material requirements planning (MRP) [14]. These systems helped
translate master production schedules into the planning of raw material requirements. In the 80’s
came the concept of MRP-II, which involved optimizing an entire plant’s production processes.
New technological advances facilitated the development of software systems to manage
functional areas such as finance and human resources, and made possible the implementation of
the conceptual model proposed by Blumenthal [15]. This model described an integrated
architecture and framework for organizational information systems, which can be seen as the
seed of ERP systems. Important progress has been made since then, and currently various ERP
systems are available, including Baan, CSC, JD Edwards, Oracle, PeopleSoft, and SAP. General
information on ERP systems can be found at the TechRepublic’s web site [16].
By analyzing the historical evolution and maturity of the two systems, we can observe that
ERP systems emerged from a steady progression that can be traced from the 60’s to a high point
in the mid-late-90’s, with major success stories around the world. This progressive evolution has
lead to a trusted and well-known product in the industry, with high credibility, a good position in
the market, and a strong advantage over competitive systems. Furthermore, ERP systems were in
a mature state, and WfMS were not, at the time organizations needed to solve critical problems,
such as the Y2K problem and the replacement of outdated legacy systems.
The stronger acceptance of ERP systems is reflected in industry buying patterns. According to
Aberdeen Group's estimates, the spending in the Business Process Management software sector
(which includes workflow systems) has reached $2.26 billion in 2001 [17]. In comparison, ERP
systems revenue was $21.5 billion in 2000, according to the research company International Data
Corp. (IDC) [18]. The cycles of popularity of OIS and WfMS – in the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s – has
certainly generated confusion among managers and end-users and provoked a certain reluctance
to adopt workflow systems. However, it appears that WfMS will have a key role in future efforts,
especially in the systems integration area. This paper will help clear up this confusion by
comparing these systems and discussing their future roles.

2 WfMS and ERP systems
Keeping in mind the evolution and maturity paths of the systems under study, we now turn our
attention to the conceptual differences between the two systems. Our goal is not to do a
comprehensive analysis of all factors involved in selecting and implementing WfMS and ERP
systems, which is clearly beyond the scope of a single paper. Instead, we focus on the major
differences in the technologies themselves and what they can do for a business. Thus, we do not
discuss factors such as costs, human issues, etc.
We compare the two technologies along three main dimensions: domain scope, technological
scope, and system implementation. Each dimension helps compare the two systems from a
specific point of view. We picked these three dimensions because they highlight the key
differences in the systems. The major differences are summarized in Table 1.
