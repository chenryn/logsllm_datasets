Here is a minimal working example.
    module MWE
    module A
        struct S
            x
        end
        export S
    end
    module B
        using ..A
        f(x::S) = x  # stops "working" if I comment it out
        S() = S(1)
    end
    end  # module
    MWE.A.S()  # works!
I tried to find if the issue is already posted but I couldn't find any. I
checked the MWE with 1.1.0-DEV.98 and 1.0.0.
