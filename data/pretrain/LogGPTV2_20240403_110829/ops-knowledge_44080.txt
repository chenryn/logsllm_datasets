User: Is there a way to do multiple calls in the same "session" in Popen? For instance, can I make a call through it and then another one after it without having to concatenate the commands into one long string?

Sounds like you're using shell=True. Don't, unless you need to. Instead use shell=False (the default) and pass in a command/arg list.

Any reason you can't just create two Popen instances and wait/communicate on each as necessary? That's the normal way to do it, if I understand you correctly.
