attacker needs to pre-record speech, including voice com-
mands for both activation and recognition. Speech synthesis
and Voice conversion are techniques that alleviate this limita-
tion. Speech synthesis (Text-to-speech, TTS) is a technique to
generate natural speech sound from the text. Wavenet [17]
is one example that creates synthesized voices by using
deep learning models. Voice conversion aims to convert an
attacker’s voice to a victim’s voice in real time. We do not
need to prepare text, unlike in TTS. These attacks offer an
effective way to generate synthetic speech in a manner such
that the generated output is perceived as a sentence uttered
by a target. In [15], the author demonstrated that an attacker
can successfully execute a voice impersonation attack by
using an off-the-shelf voice-conversion tool, even against
state-of-the-art voice veriﬁcation systems. They reveal that
the attacker can convert his/her voice if they collect just a
few minutes’ worth of audio.
While these attack techniques aim at impersonating the
victim’s voice, our goal focuses on the different attack
vector, i.e., secretly delivering the voice signal to the target
voice assistant device. As our attack is agnostic to the voice
content, voice presentation attack techniques can be directly
mounted on our attack.
3 THREAT MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
In this section, we describe the Audio Hotspot Attack
threat model by making several assumptions to evaluate the
threat.
Target of the attack
The goal of an attacker is to manipulate the target
voice assistance device without being noticed by people.
Although the attack is applicable to various voice assistance
systems in principle, a smart speaker is used herein as an
example of the target device. Because smart speakers can
control smart home devices, the attack vector ranges are

to use this device anywhere. The circuit contains ampliﬁer and ampliﬁed
modulator. The details of the circuit are presented in Fig. 5.
widespread. We evaluated the attack using two smart speak-
ers, Amazon Echo and Google Home. For these devices, an
attacker must activate the device with a wake-up word, and
then transmit a voice command. In this study, we assume
that the target device is not moving (i.e., it is set on a ﬁxed
place, for example, on the table). This assumption is natural
in the case of smart speakers.
Attacker’s equipment
As shown in Figure 1, the Audio Hotspot Attack has
linear attack and cross attack. An
the two attack modes:
attacker needs to setup a parametric loudspeaker for the
linear attack, and two parametric loudspeakers for the cross
attack. The parametric loudspeaker that performs the attack
is small and portable. The attacker also needs to carry a
smartphone in order to generate malicious voice commands
from the parametric loudspeakers. Figure 4 shows an ex-
ample of a device setup used by an attacker to execute an
attack.
Speaker recognition
As mentioned in Section 2, modern devices equipped
with voice assistance systems such as smartphones or smart
speakers have increasingly adopted the speaker recognition
functionality. If the owner of a device has turned on this
functionality, an attacker may not be able to succeed in the
attack even when he/she has successfully transmitted an
inaudible voice command to the target device.
Here, the attacker collects voice samples by being in close
physical proximity to the target, by making a phone call, or
by searching for clips online. For the purposes of this work,
we assumed that an attacker was able to bypass the speaker
recognition by leveraging voice presentation attacks, which
are discussed in Section 2.3. As shown in Section 7.2.3,
there are some methods that detect presentation attacks
(PAD method). We assume that the voice assistance systems
do not have a PAD method. We conﬁrm that presentation
attacks are successful on practical devices, i.e., Google Home
and Amazon Echo, before the experiments.

software used, together with their settings.

TABLE 1
Fig. 5. Circuit diagram. The circuit ﬁrst applies AM to the input sound-
wave, using the generated ultrasonic wave as a carrier wave. Next,
the sound pressure of the AM wave will be ampliﬁed. The ampliﬁed
soundwave will be the output for the parametric loudspeaker.
4.1 Materials
4.1.1 Experiment room
Sound wave dynamics depend on the material makeup of
the room. As these attacks were performed using sound
waves, the choice of the experiment room was key. Oth-
erwise, the obtained results will be valid only for a speciﬁc
environment. To overcome this concern, we used a room
designed for acoustic experimentation. To eliminate the ef-
fects of the material makeup of the room, all wall and ceiling
surfaces were made of sound-absorbing material (Appendix
B, Figure 2).
The average sound pressure level (SPL) of the room was
around 12 dB(A). Here, dB(A) denotes A-weighted SPL,
which is applied to instrument-measured sound levels. A-
weighting is used because the human ear is less sensitive to
lower audible frequencies.
4.1.2 Target devices
Following the assumption that the target device is station-
ary, Google Home and Amazon Alexa are the primary target
devices used for the analysis. These devices were chosen
because they accounted for more than 95% of the smart
speaker market share in 2018 [18].
4.1.3 Equipment used for the experiments
Table 1 shows a list of equipment used for the experiments.
While there are several commercial parametric loudspeaker
products, we intended to take a white-box approach. That
is, as the details of the board and elements are publicly
available on the manufacturers’ websites, we can obtain the
technical speciﬁcations of the speaker, such as frequency
response. To this end, the Switch Science Super direc-
tional speaker [19] was adopted as a primary parametric
loudspeaker. The kit comprises two printed circuit boards
(PCBs). One PCB has an AM circuit, an ampliﬁer circuit, an
audio input (3.5 mm stereo mini jack), and a power input
(DC 12V/1A). Figure 5 presents a diagram of the circuits.
Another PCB implements 49 ultrasonic ceramic transducers
connected in parallel. The ﬁrst PCB applies the AM to
the input sound wave and then ampliﬁes the signal level.
The ampliﬁed signal is transmitted to the second PCB, i.e.,
ultrasound transducers. Another parametric loudspeaker—
directional speaker ACOUSPADE—is also used, to study the
maximum distance at which the attack can succeed. The
sound level meter is capable of measuring the SPL of 28–
138 dB(A) for a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The

4.2 Voice generation
To generate a malicious voice speech command, we used
Amazon Polly [26], a cloud service that turns text into
natural sounding speech. As the basis for the analysis,
the voice named “Ivy” was used, which is a female, US
English accent. The voice parameters (e.g., speaking rate or
fundamental frequency) were set to default values. All voice
assistance systems that were tested to check whether they
accept synthesized voice commands. As speech synthesis
services can change in the future, we plan to make our data
available to any researchers who wish to replicate or extend
our work.
5 EVALUATION OF THE ATTACK
We evaluated attack feasibility using the following aspects:
maximum successful attack distance, noise tolerance of the
attack, and the impact of voice commands. For simplicity,
and to evaluate the impact of these factors, we applied
a linear attack. For the cross attack, we evaluated attack
feasibility using the parameters obtained through the lin-
ear attack experiments. The attack success depends on the
type of voice command (i.e., activation or recognition).
Therefore, for each attack mode, we applied both types of
voice commands. In general, activation commands (“wake-
up words”) are more likely to succeed.
5.1 Distance versus Attack success rate
The aim of this study was to clarify how the distance
between the target device and adversary’s parametric loud-
speaker affected the success rate of the Audio Hotspot
Attack. Throughout the experiments, the SPL of the output
power from the parametric loudspeaker was ﬁxed. In par-
ticular, the audible sound of the parametric loudspeakers
was adjusted to 60 dB(A), and the SPL of the ultrasound
was 100 dB at a point 3 m away from the parametric
loudspeaker. Figure 6 presents the experimental setup. The
distance measured was between the parametric loudspeaker
and the microphone of the voice assistance systems.

Fig. 7. Distance versus attack success rate. Noise SPL is set to 60
dB(A). For Google Home, the longest distance was 3.5 m. Activation
voice commands were more likely to be accepted compared to recogni-
tion voice commands.
To measure the distance, we used the experiment room
(described in section 4.1.1). We extended the study to three
different locations, including a hallway, seminar-room, and
outdoors.
5.1.1 Measurement within the experiment room
The distance between the target device and the parametric
loudspeaker was altered from 0.1 m to 5 m in increments
of 50 cm (i.e., 0.1, 0.5, 1.0,..., 5.0 m). By adjusting the output
power of the dynamic speakers, we were able to adjust the
SPL of the noise measured in the room to 60 dB(A) with
error bounds within 1 dB(A). Notably, a SPL of 60 dB(A)
corresponds to an environment where a person’s speech is
heard at a distance of 1 m. Thus, the noise level was fairly
high. This setting was purposively chosen to conservatively
evaluate attack success rate (i.e., a higher attack success
rate could be expected in quieter settings). We note that the
1/f noises better suited to emulate a realistic environment
than the white noise because it is natural that signals with
the lower or higher frequencies have more or less power
respectively.
For a given distance, a pair of activation and recog-
nition voice commands were generated. This process was
repeated 25 times. For each voice command, we noted if
the command was accepted by the voice assistance system
by observing the response of the device. For the activation
commands, “Ok Google” for Google Home and “Alexa” for
Amazon Echo were used. For the recognition voice com-
mands, “What’s on my next schedule?” for Google Home and
“What’s on my schedule?” for Amazon Echo2 were used.
The attack success rates were calculated, and the results
are shown in Figure 7. For a certain range of distances,
the attack was highly successful for both devices. This was
particularly true for Google Home, the longest distance
was 3.5 m. Activation voice commands were more likely to
be accepted than recognition voice commands. This makes
sense given the fact that the recognition voice commands
are much more variable than activation voice commands. In
the short distance, the success rate becomes low because the
acoustic sound was too loud to be properly processed by
the voice assistance systems. Finally, Google Home featured
a higher attack success rate than Amazon Echo. As these
commercial products are black box in nature, their behaviors
can be difﬁcult to interpret. It is possible that circuits and
software used for Amazon Echo are somehow resistant to
the Audio Hotspot Attack; therefore, they will be investi-
gated in future studies.
5.1.2 Extended measurement in practical environments.
Next, we studied the distances of successful attacks using
different locations: a hallway, a seminar room, and outside.
The hallway and the room have much higher reverberation
compared to the room dedicated for acoustic experiments.
We used a commercial parametric loudspeaker product [21],
as listed in Table 1. The parametric loudspeaker can emit
full frequency-range speech with the audible SPL of 62–
63 dB(A) at a distance of 3 m. For reference, the location
photos are shown in Appendix B. Note that for these
locations, we did not add synthesized noise sounds. The
average SPL measured in the hallway was 39.3 dB(A), the
seminar room was 55.2 dB(A), and the average outside SPL
was 52.5 dB(A). The conditions outside were as follows:
the weather on the day was ﬁne, with temperature was
23.2 ◦C (73.8 ◦F), a humidity of 36%, and a wind speed of
6 m/s southward. Note that, we do not use synthesized
noise in this measurement, to evaluate the effect of noise
on realistic environments. The purpose of the experiment
was to determine the longest distance at which the attack is
still effective, with the effectiveness being determined using
the following criteria: if three consecutive voice commands
are all accepted for a given distance, the attack is regarded
as effective for the distance. For each location, the starting
distance was 1 m and the tests were repeated until there was
an attack failure. Tables 2 summarize our results.
The hallway experiment demonstrated that the attack
was effective at a distance of 10+ m. The seminar room
and outside experiment demonstrated that the attack was
effective to a distance of 4+ m. The difference in the at-
tack success distances reﬂects the respective noise levels
within each location. These results indicated that the Audio
Hotspot Attack was feasible in three real-world scenarios.
We can succeed in the attack in two environments with
reverberation, i.e., the hallway and inside the room. We
also showed that the experiment was successful outside
the room. In addition, the attack success distances achieved
were much longer than the state-of-the-art inaudible voice
2. At the time of the experiment, Alexa did not support the ‘next’
voice command for the calendar.

that the maximum distance for Amazon Echo averaged 1.65
m with a background noise of 55 dB SPL.
5.2 Noise tolerance
We studied how the noise affects the attack success rate.
For this study, we used the experiment room, as described
in Section 4.1.1. Because we were examining the effects of
noise, the sound generated by the parametric loudspeaker
was ﬁxed at 60 dB(A) and the distance between the para-
metric loudspeaker and the target device was 1.5 m.
5.2.1 Stationary noise
Using the dynamic speaker, we generated 1/f noise with an
