## Abstract
Control-plane protocols in cellular networks are inherently complex, involving interactions across multiple layers, domains (circuit-switched and packet-switched), and systems (3G and 4G). This work introduces signaling diagnosis tools to identify and analyze problematic interactions. We uncover six instances of such issues, which can be attributed to both design flaws in the 3GPP standards and operational errors by carriers. These control-plane issues can be more severe than data-plane failures, potentially leading to service outages in 4G or degraded performance in 3G. We provide root cause analysis, propose solutions, and summarize key lessons learned.

## 1. Introduction
Cellular networks serve as large-scale wireless infrastructures for mobile data and voice services. A key feature of these networks is their control-plane protocols, which are more complex than those in the Internet. These protocols follow a layered architecture and operate at both the network infrastructure and end devices, providing essential functionalities such as mobility support, radio resource control, and session management for data and voice.

In this paper, we examine the interactions among critical control-plane protocols in cellular networks. Our goal is to identify and address problems that arise during inter-protocol communications. While each individual protocol may be well-designed, the proper interaction among them in a networked environment is not guaranteed.

There are two main challenges:
1. **Limited Accessibility**: Unlike the Internet, cellular networks are closed systems, making it difficult to access signaling exchanges from carriers or devices during normal operations.
2. **Complex Interactions**: Control-plane interactions in cellular networks are more complex, spanning cross-layer, cross-domain, and cross-system scenarios. Both packet switching (PS) and circuit switching (CS) are used to support data and carrier-grade voice services, and inter-system switching between 3G and 4G is common due to hybrid deployments and user mobility.

To address these challenges, we developed CNetVerifier, a tool that uses model-checking methods with cellular-specific heuristics to analyze these interactions. Our findings include six instances of problematic interactions, categorized into necessary but problematic cooperations and independent but coupled operations. We validate these findings with traces collected from two US carriers and assess their real-world impact through a two-week user study. We also propose and evaluate solutions to mitigate these issues.

## 2. Background
The cellular network architecture consists of base stations (BSes) and a core network. BSes provide radio access to user devices, while the core network connects them to the wired Internet or public telephony network. Figure 1 illustrates the network architecture and main protocols for both 3G and 4G.

### 2.1 4G LTE Network
The 4G LTE network primarily supports PS data services and includes three core elements:
1. **MME (Mobility Management Entity)**: Manages user mobility, such as location updates and paging.
2. **4G Gateways**: Route PS packets between the Internet and 4G BSes.
3. **HSS (Home Subscriber Server)**: Stores user subscription information.

### 2.2 3G Network
The 3G network supports both CS and PS services and includes:
1. **MSC (Mobile Switching Center)**: Handles CS services, such as voice calls.
2. **3G Gateways**: Forward PS data packets.
3. **HSS**: Similar to its counterpart in 4G.

### 2.3 Layered Structure
Cellular network protocols adopt a layered structure, similar to the Internet. The data plane handles actual data and voice transfer, while the control plane provides signaling functions to facilitate data-plane operations. Key control-plane functions include:
1. **Connectivity Management (CM)**: Manages voice calls and data sessions.
2. **Mobility Management (MM)**: Provides location updates and mobility support.
3. **Radio Resource Control (RRC)**: Controls radio resources and routes signaling messages.

### 2.4 Major Procedures
#### Attach/Detach
A mobile device must attach to the cellular network before using any service. This process is managed by MM, GMM, and EMM protocols. Once attached, the device is registered until it detaches, either by the device (e.g., powering off) or the network (e.g., resource constraints).

#### Data and Voice Services
Both data and voice services are essential. For data services, the device establishes a bearer with the core network via EPS Bearer activation (4G) or PDP Context activation (3G). For voice services, 3G uses CS, while 4G uses VoLTE or CSFB.

#### Radio Resource Control (RRC)
RRC controls radio resources and ensures an established RRC connection for communication. It uses an IDLE and CONNECTED state machine, with additional sub-states for optimization and energy efficiency.

#### Mobility Management
Cellular networks support intra-system handover (within 3G or 4G) and inter-system switch (between 3G and 4G). Mobility support is realized through location area updates, routing area updates, and tracking area updates.

## 3. Methodology
We developed CNetVerifier, a tool that analyzes control-plane protocol interactions. The tool uses model-checking methods and cellular-specific heuristics to collect and validate protocol traces. We applied the tool to examine cross-layer, cross-domain, and cross-system interactions.

## 4. Findings
Our study identified six instances of problematic interactions, summarized in Table 1. These issues span two categories:
1. **Necessary but Problematic Cooperations**:
   - **S1**: Temporary out-of-service during 3G→4G switching.
   - **S2**: Temporary out-of-service during the attach procedure.
   - **S3**: User device gets stuck in 3G.
2. **Independent but Coupled Operations**:
   - **S4**: Delayed outgoing call/Internet access.
   - **S5**: PS rate decline during ongoing CS service.
   - **S6**: Temporary out-of-service after 3G→4G switching.

## 5. Root Cause Analysis
### 5.1 Necessary but Problematic Cooperations
- **S1**: Shared states between 3G and 4G are unprotected and deleted during inter-system switching.
- **S2**: Higher-layer protocols make unrealistic assumptions about lower layers.
- **S3**: Inconsistent policies for CS and PS domains in 3G and 4G.

### 5.2 Independent but Coupled Operations
- **S4**: Location updates are prioritized over outgoing calls/data requests.
- **S5**: Shared channel configuration for both data and voice leads to rate reduction.
- **S6**: Failure propagation between systems causes temporary out-of-service.

## 6. Solutions and Evaluation
We propose and evaluate solutions to address the identified issues. These solutions aim to improve the robustness and efficiency of control-plane interactions in cellular networks.

## 7. Conclusion
Control-plane protocol interactions in cellular networks are complex and can lead to significant service disruptions. By using CNetVerifier, we have uncovered and analyzed six instances of problematic interactions. Our findings highlight the need for better design and operational practices to ensure reliable and efficient cellular network performance.
