INTRODUCTION
ABSTRACT
Control-plane protocols are complex in cellular networks. They
communicate with one another along three dimensions of cross
layers, cross (circuit-switched and packet-switched) domains, and
cross (3G and 4G) systems. In this work, we propose signaling di-
agnosis tools and uncover six instances of problematic interactions.
Such control-plane issues span both design defects in the 3GPP
standards and operational slips by carriers. They are more damag-
ing than data-plane failures. In the worst-case scenario, users may
be out of service in 4G, or get stuck in 3G. We deduce root causes,
propose solutions, and summarize learned lessons.

1.
The cellular network serves as a large-scale wireless infrastruc-
ture to support mobile data and voice services. A salient feature of
its design has been its control-plane protocols. Compared with the
Internet, these components provide more complex signaling func-
tions. They follow the layered protocol architecture (see Figure
1 for an illustration), and run at both the network infrastructure
and the end device. Together, they provide control utilities vital to
3G/4G networks, including mobility support, radio resource con-
trol, session management for data and voice, etc..
In this paper, we examine protocol interactions in cellular net-
works. We focus on a set of critical components on the control
plane (see Table 2 for the list). Our goal is to uncover problems dur-
ing inter-protocol communications. Although each signaling pro-
tocol may be well designed individually, proper interactions among
them in the networked environment are not guaranteed.
There are two challenges. First, compared with the Internet, cel-
lular networks are still closed systems. Signaling exchanges are
not readily accessible from carriers, nor from devices during nor-
mal operations. Second, patterns of inter-protocol communication
on the control plane are much richer than their Internet counter-
parts. In addition to the inter-layer case, they exhibit in both cross-
domain and cross-system scenarios in cellular networks. Since

both data and carrier-grade voice are indispensable services, both
packet switching (PS) and circuit switching (CS) are used. Signal-
ing protocols thus regulate both PS and CS domains. Moreover,
Inter-system switching between 3G and 4G is also common due to
hybrid deployment, user mobility, or CSFB (CS Fallback)-based
calls. Signaling protocols consequently need to work cross 3G and
4G systems. In a nutshell, interactions among control-plane pro-
tocols are common in 3G/4G systems. They span three dimen-
sions: between layers of the protocol stack (cross-layer1), between
CS and PS domains (cross-domain), and between 3G and 4G sys-
tems (cross-system).
In this work, we devise CNetVeriﬁer, a tool to analyze all such
cases (§3). Our tool adapts model-checking methods with cellular-
speciﬁc heuristics. It further instruments the device to collect proto-
col traces for validation. We apply the tool and delve into all above
three dimensions. Our study yields interesting ﬁndings (§4). We
show two classes of problematic interactions among signaling pro-
tocols. They are exempliﬁed using six concrete instances, spanning
cross-layer, cross-domain, and cross-system dimensions (see Ta-
ble 1). In the ﬁrst class (§5), we show that some inter-protocol com-
munications are necessary yet troublesome. The necessity of sig-
naling synergy is partly driven by the requirement for carrier-grade
voice support, partly by inter-system switching in hybrid 3G/4G
deployments, and partly by mobility management. However, inter-
actions among signaling protocols are not always designed and op-
erated right: (S1) a user device is temporarily out of service because
its vital context in 4G is shared but not well protected (being deleted
after inter-system switching); (S2) Users are denied network access
right after being accepted because higher-layer protocols make un-
realistic assumptions on lower layers; (S3) 4G users get stuck in
3G because inconsistent policies are used for CS and PS domains
in 3G and 4G. The second class (§6) concerns independent op-
erations by protocols. We discover that, some are unnecessarily
coupled and have unexpected consequence: (S4) outgoing calls are
delayed for unjustiﬁed location updates because cross-layer actions
are “improperly” correlated and prioritized; (S5) PS data sessions
suffer from rate reduction (51%− 96% drop observed) when trafﬁc
in both domains shares the same channel; (S6) User devices are out
of service when the failure is propagated to another system. We
validate most instances with traces collected from our tool when
running tests over two US carriers. We further conduct a two-week
user study to assess their real-world impact (§7). We propose and
evaluate solutions that help to resolve above issues (§8 and §9).
2. BACKGROUND
The cellular network architecture consists of base stations (BSes)
and a core network. The BSes provide radio access to user devices
(e.g., phones), whereas the core network connects them to the wired
Internet or the public telephony network. Figure 1 illustrates the
network architecture and main protocols for both 3G and 4G.
The 4G LTE network offers PS data service only. It has three
core elements: (1) MME (Mobility Management Entity) to manage

for a slight abuse of deﬁnition.

user mobility (e.g., location update or paging), (2) 4G gateways
that route PS packets between the Internet and the 4G BSes, and
(3) HSS (Home Subscriber Server), which stores user subscription
information. In contrast, the 3G network supports both CS and PS
services. Its core network consists of: (1) MSC (Mobile Switch-
ing Center), which pages and establishes CS services (i.e., voice
calls) with mobile devices, (2) 3G Gateways, which forward PS
data packets, and (3) HSS, which is similar to its counterpart in 4G.
Similar to the Internet, cellular network protocols have adopted
the layered structure. The protocol family spans both data and con-
trol planes. The data plane is responsible for actual data and voice
transfer. The control plane provides a variety of signaling func-
tions to facilitate the data-plane operations. Speciﬁcally, three ma-
jor functions are provisioned at three sub-layers: (1) Connectivity
Management (CM), which is responsible for creating and mandat-
ing voice calls and data sessions; (2) Mobility Management (MM),
which provides location update and mobility support for call/data
sessions; (3) Radio Resource Control (RRC), which controls radio
resources and helps to route signaling messages.
Attach/detach cellular networks.
The mobile device must at-
tach to the cellular networks before using any cellular network ser-
vice2 (e.g., data or voice service). It happens when the device pow-
ers on. The attach procedure is mandated by Mobility Management
control protocols (i.e., MM, GMM and EMM) running on mobile
devices, 3G MSC, 3G Gateways and 4G MME, respectively. Once
it completes, the mobile device is “registered” until being detached.
The detach procedure can be triggered either by the device (e.g., the
phone powers off) or the network (e.g., under resource constraints).
Once detached, the device enters the “deregistered” (i.e., "out-of-
service") state and cannot access any cellular service.
Data and voice services.
Both are essential services offered by
cellular networks. To enable any data service, the mobile device
has to ﬁrst establish a bearer with the core network. This proce-
dure is done via “EPS Bearer activation” in 4G or “PDP Context
activation” in 3G, which is mandated by Evolved Session Man-

agement (ESM in 4G) or Session Management (SM in 3G). Once
it succeeds, the core network assigns an IP address, reserves re-
sources to meet QoS requirements and establishes the routing path
for the device. In fact, the information vital to data sessions (e.g.,
IP address and QoS parameters) is stored at both the device and the
3G/4G gateways via the 3G PDP (or 4G EPS bearer) context.
In 3G, the voice service is supported via CS and handled by
the Call Control (CC) protocol at the mobile device and MSC. In
4G, the voice service is designed to run over PS via Voice-over-
LTE (VoLTE) [2]. However, due to the high deployment cost and
complexity of VoLTE, most 4G operators adopt another voice solu-
tion, Circuit-Switched Fallback (CSFB), which switches 4G users
to legacy 3G and accesses CS voice service in 3G [5].
Radio resource control (RRC). RRC is responsible for control-
ling radio resources between the device and the BS. An established
RRC connection is the prerequisite for any communication (data,
voice or signaling) between the device and the core network. A
RRC state machine is used for this purpose. Two states of IDLE
and CONNECTED denote whether the RRC connection has been es-
tablished or not. For goals of optimization and energy efﬁciency,
3G and 4G also offer multiple connected sub-states. Speciﬁcally,
3G uses FACH and DCH. The former supports low-rate communi-
cation with less radio resource and power consumption, whereas
the latter consumes more but sends packets at higher speed. In con-
trast, 4G supports three modes of continuous reception, short and
long discontinuous reception.
Mobility management. The cellular network supports two types
of mobility: (1) intra-system handover, where the user stays within
3G or 4G only and updates its location during roaming. It is done
by one of the following procedures: location area update via MSC
(3G CS), routing area update via 3G Gateways (3G PS) or tracking
area update via MME (4G); (2) inter-system switch, where the user
device switches between 3G and 4G. Once the switch succeeds, the
device updates its location to the new serving network via the above
procedure. For signaling protocols, mobility support is realized
