User: Anybody know how this can be done?  I took a look at cx_Freeze, but it seems that it doesn't compile everything necessary into one binary (i.e., the python builtins aren't present).
Assistant: The standard freeze tool (from Tools/freeze) can be used to make fully-standalone binaries on Unix, including all extension modules and builtins (and omitting anything that is not directly or indirectly imported).
