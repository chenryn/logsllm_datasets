Hello everyone,

I recently attempted to use the BART summarization code and encountered a question regarding the `finetune.py` script. Specifically, I would like to know if it is possible to load a `SummarizationTrainer` checkpoint as a `BartForConditionalGeneration` model within the evaluation script.

Thank you for your assistance.
