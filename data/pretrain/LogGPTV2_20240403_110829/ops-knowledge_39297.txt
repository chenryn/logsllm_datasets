User: I use eclipse to write python codes using pydev. So far I have been using dropbox to synchronize my workspace. 
However, this is far from ideal. I would like to use github (or another SCM platform) to upload my code so I can work with it from different places. 
However, I have found many tutorials kind of daunting... Maybe because they are ready for projects shared between many programers
Would anyone please share with me their experience on how to do this? Or any basic tutorial to do this effectively?
Thanks
Assistant: I use bitbucket coupled with mercurial. That is my repository is on bitbucket and i pull and psuh to it from mercurial within eclipse
For my backup i have an independent carbonite process going to net back all hard disk files. But I imagine there is a clever free programatic way to do so. If one knew how to write the appropriate scripts.
Glad the first suggestion was helpful .you are wise to bite the bullet and get this in place now. ;)
