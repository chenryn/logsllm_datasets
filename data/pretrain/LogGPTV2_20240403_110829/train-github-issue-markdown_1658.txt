It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could
add JSX like capabilities. I mean add tiny syntactic sugar to enable XML like
constructs inside dart code. It just makes code so much easier to
read/develop/debug/maintain and also easier for powerful GUI builders to
integrate with editable code.
Looking for something like DSX:

The current issue with DSX is about proper integration with Flutter tools as
to provide a great developer experience with debugger, auto-complete, etc.
working on .dsx files.
Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-
complete is a non starter for me. If anybody wants to help, what I need is to
figure out a way to add full preprocessing support (with source map) to Dart
Tools and VS Code Dart plug in. Once the tools support that DSX or any other
transpiling language (any language that is a superset of Dart but compiles
everything down to Dart) would just work.
If you can and would like to help, let me know.
