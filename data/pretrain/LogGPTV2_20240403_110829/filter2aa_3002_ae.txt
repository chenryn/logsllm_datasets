### Defendant's Device and Copyright Infringement

The defendant trafficked in a device that did not facilitate copyright infringement. *Id.*; see also *Storage Tech.*, 421 F.3d 1307 (same).

### Rejection of Infringement Nexus Requirement

We decline to adopt an infringement nexus requirement. While we appreciate the policy considerations expressed by the Federal Circuit in *Chamberlain*, we cannot follow its approach because it is contrary to the plain language of the statute. Additionally, the Federal Circuit failed to recognize the rationale for the statutory construction we have proposed. Its approach is based on policy concerns that are best directed to Congress or for which there appear to be other reasons that do not require such a convoluted interpretation of the statute’s language.

#### Statutory Inconsistencies

If we were to follow *Chamberlain* and impose an infringement nexus requirement, we would have to disregard the plain language of the statute. There is significant textual evidence showing Congress’s intent to create a new anti-circumvention right in § 1201(a) distinct from infringement. This evidence includes:

1. Congress’s choice to link only § 1201(b)(1) explicitly to infringement.
2. Congress’s provision in § 1201(a)(3)(A) that descrambling and decrypting devices can lead to § 1201(a) liability, even though such devices may only enable non-infringing access to a copyrighted work.
3. Congress’s creation of a mechanism in § 1201(a)(1)(B)-(D) to exempt certain non-infringing behavior from § 1201(a)(1) liability, a mechanism that would be unnecessary if an infringement nexus requirement existed.

Though the clarity of the statute’s text makes this unnecessary, see *United States v. Gallegos*, 613 F.3d 1211, 1214 (9th Cir. 2010), we note that the legislative history supports the conclusion that Congress intended to prohibit even non-infringing circumvention and trafficking in circumventing devices. Imposing a § 1201(a) nexus to infringement would deprive copyright owners of an important enforcement tool to ensure they are compensated for valuable non-infringing access, such as when movies or music are made available online, protected by an access control measure, in exchange for direct or indirect payment.

The *Chamberlain* court reasoned that if § 1201(a) creates liability for access without regard to the remainder of the Copyright Act, it “would clearly affect rights and limitations, if not remedies and defenses.” 381 F.3d at 1200. This perceived tension is relieved by our recognition that § 1201(a) creates a new anti-circumvention right distinct from the traditional exclusive rights of a copyright owner. Therefore, § 1201(a) does not limit the traditional framework of exclusive rights created by § 106, or defenses to those rights such as fair use.

#### Additional Interpretive Considerations

Although we need no further evidence of Congress’s intent, the parties, citing *Chamberlain*, proffer several other arguments, which we review briefly to address their contentions. *Chamberlain* relied heavily on policy considerations to support its reading of § 1201(a). As a threshold matter, we stress that such considerations cannot trump the statute’s plain text and structure. *Gallegos*, 613 F.3d at 1214. Even if these considerations were permissible, they would not persuade us to adopt an infringement nexus requirement. *Chamberlain* feared that § 1201(a) would allow companies to leverage their sales into aftermarket monopolies, in tension with antitrust law and the doctrine of copyright misuse.

Concerning antitrust law, we note that there is no clear issue of anti-competitive behavior in this case because Blizzard does not seek to put a direct competitor who offers a competing role-playing game out of business, and the parties have not argued this issue. If a § 1201(a)(2) defendant in a future case claims that a plaintiff is attempting to enforce its DMCA anti-circumvention right in a manner that violates antitrust law, we will then consider the interplay between this new anti-circumvention right and antitrust law.

*Chamberlain* also viewed an infringement nexus requirement as necessary to prevent “absurd and disastrous results,” such as the existence of DMCA liability for disabling a burglary alarm to gain access to a home containing copyrighted materials. 381 F.3d at 1201. The Federal Circuit was concerned that, without an infringement nexus requirement, § 1201(a) would allow copyright owners to deny all access to the public by putting an effective access control measure in place that the public is not allowed to circumvent. 381 F.3d at 1200. Both concerns appear to be overstated, but even accepting them, arguendo, as legitimate concerns, they do not permit reading the statute as requiring the imposition of an infringement nexus. As § 1201(a) creates a distinct right, it does not disturb the balance between public rights and the traditional rights of copyright owners under the Copyright Act. Moreover, § 1201(a)(1)(B)-(D) allows the Library of Congress to create exceptions to the § 1201(a) anti-circumvention right in the public’s interest. If greater protection of the public’s ability to access copyrighted works is required, Congress can provide such protection by amending the statute.

In sum, a fair reading of the statute, supported by legislative history, indicates that Congress created a distinct anti-circumvention right under § 1201(a) without an infringement nexus requirement. Thus, even accepting the validity of the concerns expressed in *Chamberlain*, those concerns do not authorize us to override congressional intent and add a non-textual element to the statute. See *In Re Dumont*, 581 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2009). Accordingly, we reject the imposition of an infringement nexus requirement.

### Analysis of MDY’s Violation of §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1)

#### Blizzard’s § 1201(a)(2) Claim

**1. WoW’s Literal Elements and Individual Non-Literal Elements**

We agree with the district court that MDY’s Glider does not violate DMCA § 1201(a)(2) with respect to WoW’s literal elements and individual non-literal elements because Warden does not effectively control access to these WoW elements. First, Warden does not control access to WoW’s literal elements because these elements—the game client’s software code—are available on a player’s hard drive once the game client software is installed. Second, as the district court found, WoW’s individual non-literal components may be accessed by a user without signing on to the server. For example, a user may call up and listen to the roar a particular monster makes within the game or call up a virtual image of that monster. Since a player need not encounter Warden to access WoW’s individual non-literal elements, Warden does not effectively control access to those elements.

Our conclusion is in accord with the Sixth Circuit’s decision in *Lexmark International v. Static Control Components*, 387 F.3d 522 (6th Cir. 2004). In *Lexmark*, the plaintiff sold laser printers equipped with an authentication sequence, verified by the printer’s copyrighted software, that ensured only the plaintiff’s own toner cartridges could be inserted into the printers. The defendant sold microchips capable of generating an authentication sequence that rendered other manufacturers’ cartridges compatible with the plaintiff’s printers. The Sixth Circuit held that the plaintiff’s § 1201(a)(2) claim failed because its authentication sequence did not effectively control access to its copyrighted computer program. The mere purchase of one of the plaintiff’s printers allowed access to the copyrighted program, and any purchaser could read the program code directly from the printer memory without encountering the authentication sequence. The authentication sequence thus blocked only one form of access: the ability to make use of the printer. However, it left intact another form of access: the review and use of the computer program’s literal code. The Sixth Circuit explained that just as a lock on the back door of a house does not control access to a house whose front door does not contain a lock, a technological measure that restricts one form of access but leaves another route wide open does not naturally extend to a technological measure that controls access “effectively” under § 1201(a)(2).

Here, a player’s purchase of the WoW game client allows access to the game’s literal elements and individual non-literal elements. Warden blocks one form of access to these elements: the ability to access them while connected to a WoW server. However, analogously to the situation in *Lexmark*, Warden leaves open the ability to access these elements directly via the user’s computer. We conclude that Warden is not an effective access control measure with respect to WoW’s literal elements and individual non-literal elements, and therefore, MDY does not violate § 1201(a)(2) with respect to these elements.

**2. WoW’s Dynamic Non-Literal Elements**

We conclude that MDY meets each of the six textual elements for violating § 1201(a)(2) with respect to WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements. Specifically, MDY (1) traffics in (2) a technology or part thereof (3) that is primarily designed, produced, or marketed for, or has limited commercially significant use other than (4) circumventing a technological measure (5) that effectively controls access (6) to a copyrighted work. See 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2).

The first two elements are met because MDY “traffics in a technology or part thereof”—that is, it sells Glider. The third and fourth elements are met because Blizzard has established that MDY markets Glider for use in circumventing Warden, thus satisfying the requirement of § 1201(a)(2)(C). Indeed, Glider has no function other than to facilitate the playing of WoW. The sixth element is met because, as the district court held, WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements constitute a copyrighted work. See, e.g., *Atari Games Corp. v. Oman*, 888 F.2d 878, 884-85 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (the audiovisual display of a computer game is copyrightable independently from the software program code, even though the audiovisual display generated is partially dependent on user input).

To “circumvent a technological measure” under § 1201(a) means to “descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner.” 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(3)(A) (emphasis added). A circuit split exists with respect to the meaning of the phrase “without the authority of the copyright owner.” The Federal Circuit has concluded that this definition imposes an additional requirement on a § 1201(a)(2) plaintiff: to show that the defendant’s circumventing device enables third parties to access the copyrighted work without the copyright owner’s authorization. See *Chamberlain*, 381 F.3d at 1193. The Second Circuit has adopted a different view, explaining that § 1201(a)(3)(A) plainly exempts from § 1201(a) liability those whom a copyright owner authorizes to circumvent an access control measure, not those whom a copyright owner authorizes to access the work. *Corley*, 273 F.3d at 444 & n.15; see also *321 Studios v. MGM Studios, Inc.*, 307 F. Supp. 2d 1085, 1096 (N.D. Cal. 2004) (same).

We find the Second Circuit’s view to be the sounder construction of the statute’s language and conclude that § 1201(a)(2) does not require a plaintiff to show that the accused device enables third parties to access the work without the copyright owner’s authorization. Thus, Blizzard has satisfied the requirements of § 1201(a)(2) with respect to WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements.
