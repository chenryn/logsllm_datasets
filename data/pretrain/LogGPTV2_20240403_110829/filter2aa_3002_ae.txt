defendant trafficked in a device that did not facilitate copy-
right infringement. Id.; see also Storage Tech., 421 F.3d 1307
(same).
5. We decline to adopt an infringement nexus requirement
[16] While we appreciate the policy considerations
expressed by the Federal Circuit in Chamberlain, we are
unable to follow its approach because it is contrary to the
plain language of the statute. In addition, the Federal Circuit
failed to recognize the rationale for the statutory construction
that we have proffered. Also, its approach is based on policy

Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 32 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
concerns that are best directed to Congress in the first
instance, or for which there appear to be other reasons that do
not require such a convoluted construction of the statute’s lan-
guage.
i. Statutory inconsistencies
Were we to follow Chamberlain in imposing an infringe-
ment nexus requirement, we would have to disregard the plain
language of the statute. Moreover, there is significant textual
evidence showing Congress’s intent to create a new anti-
circumvention right in § 1201(a) distinct from infringement.
As set forth supra, this evidence includes: (1) Congress’s
choice to link only § 1201(b)(1) explicitly to infringement; (2)
Congress’s provision in § 1201(a)(3)(A) that descrambling
and decrypting devices can lead to § 1201(a) liability, even
though descrambling and decrypting devices may only enable
non-infringing access to a copyrighted work; and (3) Con-
gress’s creation of a mechanism in § 1201(a)(1)(B)-(D) to
exempt certain non-infringing behavior from § 1201(a)(1) lia-
bility, a mechanism that would be unnecessary if an infringe-
ment nexus requirement existed.
Though unnecessary to our conclusion because of the clar-
ity of the statute’s text, see United States v. Gallegos, 613
F.3d 1211, 1214 (9th Cir. 2010), we also note that the legisla-
tive history supports the conclusion that Congress intended to
prohibit even non-infringing circumvention and trafficking in
circumventing devices. Moreover, in mandating a § 1201(a)
nexus to infringement, we would deprive copyright owners of
the important enforcement tool that Congress granted them to
make sure that they are compensated for valuable non-
infringing access — for instance, copyright owners who make
movies or music available online, protected by an access con-
trol measure, in exchange for direct or indirect payment.
The Chamberlain court reasoned that if § 1201(a) creates
liability for access without regard to the remainder of the

Copyright Act, it “would clearly affect rights and limitations,
if not remedies and defenses.” 381 F.3d at 1200. This per-
ceived tension is relieved by our recognition that § 1201(a)
creates a new anti-circumvention right distinct from the tradi-
tional exclusive rights of a copyright owner. It follows that
§ 1201(a) does not limit the traditional framework of exclu-
sive rights created by § 106, or defenses to those rights such
as fair use.
12 We are thus unpersuaded by Chamberlain’s read-
ing of the DMCA’s text and structure. 
ii. Additional interpretive considerations
Though we need no further evidence of Congress’s intent,
the parties, citing Chamberlain, proffer several other argu-
ments, which we review briefly in order to address the par-
ties’ contentions. Chamberlain relied heavily on policy
considerations to support its reading of § 1201(a). As a
threshold matter, we stress that such considerations cannot
trump the statute’s plain text and structure. Gallegos, 613
F.3d at 1214. Even were they permissible considerations in
this case, however, they would not persuade us to adopt an
infringement nexus requirement. Chamberlain feared that
§ 1201(a) would allow companies to leverage their sales into
aftermarket monopolies, in tension with antitrust law and the
doctrine of copyright misuse.
13 Id. (citing Eastman, 504 U.S.
at 455 (antitrust); Assessment Techs., 350 F.3d at 647 (copy-
12Like the Chamberlain court, we need not and do not reach the rela-
tionship between fair use under § 107 of the Copyright Act and violations
of § 1201. Chamberlain, 381 F.3d at 1199 n.14. MDY has not claimed that
Glider use is a “fair use” of WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements. Accord-
ingly, we too leave open the question whether fair use might serve as an
affirmative defense to a prima facie violation of § 1201. Id. 
13Copyright misuse is an equitable defense to copyright infringement
that denies the copyright holder the right to enforce its copyright during
the period of misuse. Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp v. Am. Med. Ass’n, 121
F.3d 516, 520 (9th Cir. 1997). Since we have held that § 1201(a) creates
a right distinct from copyright infringement, we conclude that we need not
address copyright misuse in this case.

right misuse)). Concerning antitrust law, we note that there is
no clear issue of anti-competitive behavior in this case
because Blizzard does not seek to put a direct competitor who
offers a competing role-playing game out of business and the
parties have not argued this issue. If a § 1201(a)(2) defendant
in a future case claims that a plaintiff is attempting to enforce
its DMCA anti-circumvention right in a manner that violates
antitrust law, we will then consider the interplay between this
new anti-circumvention right and antitrust law.
Chamberlain also viewed an infringement nexus require-
ment as necessary to prevent “absurd and disastrous results,”
such as the existence of DMCA liability for disabling a bur-
glary alarm to gain access to a home containing copyrighted
materials. 381 F.3d at 1201. In addition, the Federal Circuit
was concerned that, without an infringement nexus require-
ment, § 1201(a) would allow copyright owners to deny all
access to the public by putting an effective access control
measure in place that the public is not allowed to circumvent.
381 F.3d at 1200. Both concerns appear to be overstated,
14 but
even accepting them, arguendo, as legitimate concerns, they
do not permit reading the statute as requiring the imposition
of an infringement nexus. As § 1201(a) creates a distinct
right, it does not disturb the balance between public rights and
the traditional rights of owners of copyright under the Copy-
right Act. Moreover, § 1201(a)(1)(B)-(D) allows the Library
of Congress to create exceptions to the § 1201(a) anti-
circumvention right in the public’s interest. If greater protec-
14The Chamberlain court’s assertion that the public has a constitutional
right to appropriately access copyright works during the copyright term,
381 F.3d at 1200, cited Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 204-05 (2003).
The Eldred decision, however, was quoting the Supreme Court’s previous
decision in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., which
discussed the public’s right of access after the copyright term. 464 U.S.
417, 429 (1984) (“[T]he limited grant [of copyright] . . . is intended to
motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of
a special reward, and to allow the public access to the products of their
genius after the limited period of exclusive control has expired.”).

tion of the public’s ability to access copyrighted works is
required, Congress can provide such protection by amending
the statute. 
In sum, we conclude that a fair reading of the statute (sup-
ported by legislative history) indicates that Congress created
a distinct anti-circumvention right under § 1201(a) without an
infringement nexus requirement. Thus, even accepting the
validity of the concerns expressed in Chamberlain, those con-
cerns do not authorize us to override congressional intent and
add a non-textual element to the statute. See In Re Dumont,
581 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[W]here the language
of an enactment is clear or, in modern parlance, plain, and
construction according to its terms does not lead to absurd or
impracticable consequences, the words employed are to be
taken as the final expression of the meaning intended.”).
Accordingly, we reject the imposition of an infringement
nexus requirement. We now consider whether MDY has vio-
lated §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1).
E. Blizzard’s § 1201(a)(2) claim
1. WoW’s literal elements and individual non-literal 
elements
[17] We agree with the district court that MDY’s Glider
does not violate DMCA § 1201(a)(2) with respect to WoW’s
literal elements
15 and individual non-literal elements, because
Warden does not effectively control access to these WoW ele-
ments. First, Warden does not control access to WoW’s literal
elements because these elements — the game client’s soft-
ware code — are available on a player’s hard drive once the
game client software is installed. Second, as the district court
found: 
15We also agree with the district court that there are no genuine issues
of material fact on Blizzard’s § 1201(a)(2) claim regarding WoW’s literal
elements.

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 36 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
[WoW’s] individual nonliteral components may be
accessed by a user without signing on to the server.
As was demonstrated during trial, an owner of the
game client software may use independently pur-
chased computer programs to call up the visual
images or the recorded sounds within the game client
software. For instance, a user may call up and listen
to the roar a particular monster makes within the
game. Or the user may call up a virtual image of that
monster.
Since a player need not encounter Warden to access WoW’s
individual non-literal elements, Warden does not effectively
control access to those elements.
Our conclusion is in accord with the Sixth Circuit’s deci-
sion in Lexmark International v. Static Control Components,
387 F.3d 522 (6th Cir. 2004). In Lexmark, the plaintiff sold
laser printers equipped with an authentication sequence, veri-
fied by the printer’s copyrighted software, that ensured that
only plaintiff’s own toner cartridges could be inserted into the
printers. Id. at 530. The defendant sold microchips capable of
generating an authentication sequence that rendered other
manufacturers’ cartridges compatible with plaintiff’s printers.
Id. 
The Sixth Circuit held that plaintiff’s § 1201(a)(2) claim
failed because its authentication sequence did not effectively
control access to its copyrighted computer program. Id. at
546. Rather, the mere purchase of one of plaintiff’s printers
allowed “access” to the copyrighted program. Any purchaser
could read the program code directly from the printer memory
without encountering the authentication sequence. Id. The
authentication sequence thus blocked only one form of access:
the ability to make use of the printer. However, it left intact
another form of access: the review and use of the computer
program’s literal code. Id. The Sixth Circuit explained:
20018
MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 37 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
Just as one would not say that a lock on the back
door of a house “controls access” to a house whose
front door does not contain a lock and just as one
would not say that a lock on any door of a house
“controls access” to the house after its purchaser
receives the key to the lock, it does not make sense
to say that this provision of the DMCA applies to
otherwise-readily-accessible copyrighted works. Add
to this the fact that the DMCA not only requires the
technological measure to “control access” but
requires the measure to control that access “effec-
tively,” 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2), and it seems clear
that this provision does not naturally extend to a
technological measure that restricts one form of
access but leaves another route wide open.
Id. at 547.
[18] Here, a player’s purchase of the WoW game client
allows access to the game’s literal elements and individual
non-literal elements. Warden blocks one form of access to
these elements: the ability to access them while connected to
a WoW server. However, analogously to the situation in Lex-
mark, Warden leaves open the ability to access these elements
directly via the user’s computer. We conclude that Warden is
not an effective access control measure with respect to
WoW’s literal elements and individual non-literal elements,
and therefore, that MDY does not violate § 1201(a)(2) with
respect to these elements.
2. WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements
[19] We conclude that MDY meets each of the six textual
elements for violating § 1201(a)(2) with respect to WoW’s
dynamic non-literal elements. That is, MDY (1) traffics in (2)
a technology or part thereof (3) that is primarily designed,
produced, or marketed for, or has limited commercially sig-
nificant use other than (4) circumventing a technological mea-
20019
MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 38 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
sure (5) that effectively controls access (6) to a copyrighted
work. See 17 US.C. § 1201(a)(2).
The first two elements are met because MDY “traffics in a
technology or part thereof” — that is, it sells Glider. The third
and fourth elements are met because Blizzard has established
that MDY markets Glider for use in circumventing Warden,
thus satisfying the requirement of § 1201(a)(2)(C).
16 Indeed,
Glider has no function other than to facilitate the playing of
WoW. The sixth element is met because, as the district court
held, WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements constitute a copy-
righted work. See, e.g., Atari Games Corp. v. Oman, 888 F.2d
878, 884-85 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (the audiovisual display of a
computer game is copyrightable independently from the soft-
ware program code, even though the audiovisual display gen-
erated is partially dependent on user input).
16To “circumvent a technological measure” under § 1201(a) means to
“descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or other-
wise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological mea-
sure, without the authority of the copyright owner.” 17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(a)(3)(A) (emphasis added). A circuit split exists with respect to the
meaning of the phrase “without the authority of the copyright owner.” The
Federal Circuit has concluded that this definition imposes an additional
requirement on a § 1201(a)(2) plaintiff: to show that the defendant’s cir-
cumventing device enables third parties to access the copyrighted work
without the copyright owner’s authorization. See Chamberlain, 381 F.3d
at 1193.The Second Circuit has adopted a different view, explaining that
§ 1201(a)(3)(A) plainly exempts from § 1201(a) liability those whom a
copyright owner authorizes to circumvent an access control measure, not
those whom a copyright owner authorizes to access the work. Corley, 273
F.3d at 444 & n.15; see also 321 Studios v. MGM Studios, Inc., 307 F.
Supp. 2d 1085, 1096 (N.D. Cal. 2004) (same). 
We find the Second Circuit’s view to be the sounder construction of the
statute’s language, and conclude that § 1201(a)(2) does not require a plain-
tiff to show that the accused device enables third parties to access the
work without the copyright owner’s authorization. Thus, Blizzard has sat-
