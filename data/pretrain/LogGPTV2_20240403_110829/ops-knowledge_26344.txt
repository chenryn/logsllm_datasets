User: i have a python script, that submits an job to the SGE (Sun Grid Engine).
When the job is done i want to access the output file, generated from the SGE job.
i see with "ls" in the directory that the file is already existing and the job is done, but python needs about 20-30 seconds to get access to that file...
is there a way to detect new created files faster ??
my problem is to differ between "need time to access the file" or "file is not existing"
i tried:
os.path.exist(path)
os.access(path,os.R_OK)
does not solve my problem =(
Assistant: created a sleep timer which checks every second for access..
after some time (~15s), access is granted and file is usable!
