User: I am currently working on an application for Google App Engine, and I need some advice to detect the number of online users in the application. How can I do this? 
I am using a session library. Do I need to overwrite the session methods (create_session, destroy_session increment/and decrement a value in datastore) or is there another method that I can use?
Assistant: HTTP is stateless, so there's no inherent definition of "online user". You could count the number of non-destroyed sessions you've created, but unless you've got a cron job that destroys old sessions, this won't give an accurate picture.
You basically need to decide how much time without a new page request counts as "online" and query for the sessions that have been updated in that range of time.
