**Abstract:**

The threat of soft error-induced system failures in high-performance computing systems has become more prominent as we adopt ultra-deep submicron process technologies. In this paper, we propose two techniques, namely Soft Error Mitigation (SEM) and Soft and Timing Error Mitigation (STEM), to protect combinational logic blocks from soft errors. Our first technique, SEM, is based on distributed and temporal voting of three registers, which offloads the soft error detection overhead from the critical path of the system. Our second technique, STEM, adds timing error detection capability to ensure reliable execution in aggressively clocked designs, enhancing system performance by operating beyond the worst-case clock frequency. We also present a specialized low-overhead clock generation scheme that supports our proposed techniques. Timing-annotated gate-level simulations using 45 nm libraries for a pipelined adder-multiplier and DLX processor show that both our techniques achieve near 100% fault coverage. For the DLX processor, even under severe fault injection campaigns, SEM achieves an average performance improvement of 26.58% over a conventional triple modular redundancy (TMR) voter-based soft error mitigation scheme, while STEM outperforms SEM by 27.42%.

**1. Introduction**

Nano-sized transistors, coupled with deployment in hazardous environments, have magnified the reliability concerns plaguing modern computing systems. Rapid advancements in VLSI technology have fueled the increasing apprehension about system hardware being susceptible to a myriad of faults. Many fault tolerance techniques have been proposed at different levels of the design hierarchy, ranging from the design of hardened latches to system-level fault-tolerant architectures [1, 2, 8, 11]. These techniques strive to provide high degrees of fault coverage by providing redundancy in either the information, spatial, or temporal domains.

In the past, single event upsets (SEUs) were a major concern primarily in space applications, creating hard threats like loss of control and resulting in catastrophic failures. An SEU is induced when a high-energy particle, either from cosmic radiation or decaying radioactive materials, strikes the silicon substrate. If enough charge is deposited by the strike, it causes a bit flip in the memory cell or a transient pulse in the combinational logic, the latter referred to as a Single Event Transient (SET). Radiation-induced SETs have widths in the range of 500 ps to 900 ps in the 90 nm process, compared to 400 ps to 700 ps in the 130 nm process [13]. As a result, terrestrial applications also require fault tolerance techniques to ensure their dependability.

In current and future technologies, the problem of soft errors in combinational circuits is becoming comparable to that of unprotected memory elements [14]. Providing fault tolerance capabilities for random and complex logic is expensive, both in terms of area and power. Techniques such as duplication and comparison, and temporal triple modular redundancy (TMR) and majority voting, have been proposed to mitigate the soft error rate (SER) in logic circuits [10]. These approaches incur performance overhead, even during error-free operation. Additionally, at this juncture, when static power is comparable to dynamic power, logic replication is not a viable alternative.

Increasing system-wide integration forces designers to adopt worst-case design methodologies, which require safety margins to be added to individual system components to address parameter variations, including intra-die and inter-die process variations, and environmental variations, such as temperature and voltage variations [4, 5]. These additional guardbands are becoming non-negligible in nanometer technologies. Designers conservatively add these safety margins to salvage chips from timing failures and shortened lifetimes. Most systems are characterized to operate safely within vendor-specified operating frequencies. When they are operated beyond this rated frequency, timing errors that lead to system failure may occur.
