 Trademarks —A logo, symbol or mascot used for marketing a brand
 Patents — A temporary monopoly for producing a specific item such as a toy, which must be novel and
unique to qualify for a patent
 Copyright — Exclusive use of artistic, musical or literary works that prevents unauthorized duplication,

 Import/export controls. Every country has laws around the import and export of hardware and software. For
example, the United States has restrictions around the export of cryptographic technology, and Russia requires a
license to import encryption technologies manufactured outside the country.
 Trans-border data flow. If your organization adheres to specific security laws and regulations, then you should
adhere to them no matter where the data resides — for example, even if you store a second copy of your data in
another country. Be aware of the applicable laws in all countries where you store data and maintain computer
systems. In some cases, data might need to remain in the country. In other cases, you need to be careful with your
data because the technical teams might be unaware of the security and compliance requirements. The EU-US
Privacy Shield (formerly the EU-US Safe Harbor agreement) controls data flow from the EU to the United States.
The EU has more stringent privacy protections and without the Safe Harbor act, personal data flow from the EU to
the United States would not be allowed.
 Privacy. Many laws include privacy protections for personal data. The new GDPR has strong privacy rules that
apply to any organization anywhere that stores or processes the personal data of EU citizens; in particular,
individuals must be told how their data is collected and used, and they must be able to opt out. The privacy
guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) require organizations to avoid
unjustified obstacles to trans-border data flow, limit personal data collection, protect personal data with
reasonable security, and more.
1.5 Understand, adhere to, and promote professional ethics
As a CISSP, you must understand and follow the (ISC)² code of ethics, as well as your organization’s own code.
 (ISC)² Code of Professional Ethics. Take the time to read the code of ethics available at www.isc2.org/Ethics. At a
minimum, know and understand the ethics canons:
 Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.
This is “do the right thing.” Put the common good ahead of yourself. Ensure that the public can have faith
in your infrastructure and security.
 Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally. Always follow the laws. But what if you find
yourself working on a project where conflicting laws from different countries or jurisdictions apply? In such
a case, you should prioritize the local jurisdiction from which you are performing the services.
 Provide diligent and competent service to principles. Avoid passing yourself as an expert or as qualified
in areas that you aren’t. Maintain and expand your skills to provide competent services.
12
 Advance and protect the profession. Don’t bring negative publicity to the profession. Provide competent
services, get training and act honorably. Think of it like this: If you follow the first three canons in the code
of ethics, you automatically comply with this one.
 Organizational code of ethics. You must also support ethics at your organization. This can be interpreted to mean
evangelizing ethics throughout the organization, providing documentation and training around ethics, or looking
for ways to enhance the existing organizational ethics. Some organizations might have slightly different ethics than
others, so be sure to familiarize yourself with your organization’s ethics and guidelines.
1.6 Develop, document, and implement security policy, standards,
procedures and guidelines
Develop clear security policy documentation, including the following:
 Policy. This is the high-level document, often written by the management team. Policy is mandatory. It is purposely
vague. For example, a policy might require you to ensure the confidentiality of company data but not specify the
method for doing so.
 Standards. These are more descriptive than policies and document the standards to be used by the company for
things such as hardware and software. For example, an organization might standardize on virtual machines and
not physical servers.
 Procedures. These are the step-by-step documents that detail how to perform specific tasks, such as how to
restore a database. The person following the procedure uses the document to perform the task. Procedures are
mandatory. If you have a procedure for restoring a database, then that procedure needs to be followed for every
database restore.
 Guidelines. These are recommended but optional. For example, your organization might have a guideline that
recommends storing passwords in an encrypted password vault. It is a good idea to do that. But somebody might
choose to store passwords in their brain or using another secure storage mechanism.
 Baselines. Although baselines are not explicitly mentioned in this section of the exam, don’t forget about them.
Baselines automate implementation of your standards, thereby ensuring adherence to them. For example, if you
have 152 configuration items for your server builds, you can configure all of them in a baseline that is applied to
every server that is built. Group Policy objects (GPOs) are often used to comply with standards in a Windows
network. Configuration management solutions can also help you establish baselines and spot configurations that
drift away from them.
1.7 Identify, analyze, and prioritize Business Continuity (BC) requirements
Business continuity is the goal of remaining fully operational during an outage. ISO/IEC 27031 covers business continuity in
detail (it provides a framework to build on, along with methods and processes covering the entire subject). Business
continuity requires a lot of planning and preparation. The actual implementation of business continuity processes occurs
quite infrequently. The primary facets of business continuity are resilience (within a data center and between sites or data
13
centers), recovery (if a service becomes unavailable, you need to recover it as soon as possible), and contingency (a last
resort in case resilience and recovery prove ineffective).
 Develop and document scope and plan. Developing the project scope and plan starts with gaining support of the
management team, making a business case (cost/benefit analysis, regulatory or compliance reasons, etc.), and
ultimately gaining approval to move forward. Next, you need to form a team with representatives from the
business as well as IT. Then you are ready to begin developing the plan. Start with a business continuity policy
statement, then conduct a business impact analysis (as explained in the next bullet), and then develop the
remaining components: preventive controls, relocation, the actual continuity plan, testing, training and
maintenance). Be familiar with the difference between business continuity (resuming critical functions without
regard for the site) and disaster recovery (recovering critical functions at the primary site, when possible).
 Conduct a business impact analysis (BIA). Identify the systems and services that the business relies on and figure
out the impacts that a disruption or outage would cause, including the impacts on business processes like accounts
receivable and sales. You also need to figure out which systems and services you need to get things running again
(think foundational IT services such as the network and directory, which many other systems rely on). Be sure to
prioritize the order in which critical systems and services are recovered or brought back online. As part of the BIA,
you will establish the recovery time objectives (RTOs) (how long it takes to recover), the recovery point objectives
(RPOs) (the maximum tolerable data loss), and maximum tolerable downtime (MTD), along with the costs of
downtime and recovery.
1.8 Contribute to and enforce personnel security policies and procedures
In many organizations, the number one risk to the IT environment is people. And it’s not just IT staff, but anyone who has
access to the network. Malicious actors routinely target users with phishing and spear phishing campaigns, social
engineering, and other types of attacks. Everybody is a target. And once attackers compromise an account, they can use
that entry point to move around the network and elevate their privileges. The following strategies can reduce your risk:
 Candidate screening and hiring. Screening candidates thoroughly is a critical part of the hiring process. Be sure
to conduct a full background check that includes a criminal records check, job history verification, education
verification, certification validation and confirmation of other accolades when possible. Additionally, contact all
references.
 Employment agreements and policies. An employment agreement specifies job duties, expectations, rate of pay,
benefits and information about termination. Sometimes, such agreements are for a set period (for example, in a
contract or short-term job). Employment agreements facilitate termination when needed for an underperforming
employee. The more information and detail in an employment agreement, the less risk (risk of a wrongful
termination lawsuit, for example) the company has during a termination proceeding. For instance, a terminated
employee might take a copy of their email with them without thinking of it as stealing, but they are less likely to do
so if an employment agreement or another policy document clearly prohibits it.
 Onboarding and termination processes. Onboarding comprises all the processes tied to a new employee
starting at your organization. Having a documented process in place enables new employees to be integrated as
quickly and consistently as possible, which reduces risk. For example, if you have five IT admins performing the
various onboarding processes, you might get different results each time if you don’t have the processes
14
standardized and documented; a new hire might end up with more access than required for their job. Termination
is sometimes a cordial process, such as when a worker retires after 30 years. Other times, it can be a high-stress
situation, such as when a person is being terminated unexpectedly. You need to have documented policies and
procedures to handle all termination processes. The goal is to have a procedure to immediately revoke all access
to all company resources. In a perfect world, you would push one button and all access would be revoked
immediately.
 Vendor, consultant, and contractor agreements and controls. When workers who are not full-time employees
have access to your network and data, you must take extra precautions. Consultants often work with multiple
customers simultaneously, so you need to have safeguards in place to ensure that your company’s data isn’t mixed
in with data from other organizations, or accidentally or deliberately transmitted to unauthorized people. In highsecurity organizations, it is common to have the organization issue a computing device to consultants and enable
the consultant to access the network and data only through that device. Beyond the technical safeguards, you must
also have a way to identify consultants, vendors and contractors. For example, maybe they have a different security
badge than regular full-time employees. Perhaps they sit in the same area or their display names in the directory
call out their status.
 Compliance policy requirements. Organizations have to adhere to different compliance mandates, depending
on their industry, country and other factors. All of them need to maintain documentation about their policies and
procedures for meeting those requirements. Employees should be trained on the company’s compliance mandates
at a high level upon hire and regularly thereafter (such as re-certifying once a year).
 Privacy policy requirements. Personally identifiable information about employees, partners, contractors,
customers and other people should be stored in a secure way, accessible only to those who require the information
to perform their jobs. For example, somebody in the Payroll department might need access to an employee’s
banking information to have their pay automatically deposited, but no one else should be able to access that data.
Organizations should maintain a documented privacy policy that outlines the types of data covered by the policy
and who the policy applies to. Employees, contractors and anyone else who might have access to the data should
be required to read and agree to the privacy policy upon hire and on a regular basis thereafter (such as annually).
1.9 Understand and apply risk management concepts
Risk management involves three primary steps: identify threats and vulnerabilities, assess the risk (risk assessment), and
choose whether and how to respond (often the choice is risk mitigation). As part of managing overall risk, the IT team strives
to secure the IT environment, provide information to the management teams so that they can make informed decisions,
and enable the management team to sign off on the IT environment based on the goals and requirements. Risk
management also has a financial component: The management team must balance the risk with the budget. In a perfect
world, the company would spend the minimum amount of money and time to minimize risk to an acceptable level for the
organization.
 Identify threats and vulnerabilities. Threats and vulnerabilities are linked. A threat (such as a hacker taking over
a client computer) is possible when a vulnerability (such as an unpatched client computer) is present. That is a
known threat. But unknown threats also exist, such as when a hacker is aware of a bug that nobody else knows
about in your anti-virus software and can remotely compromise your computer.
15
 Assess risk. You have a risk when you have a threat and a vulnerability. In those cases, you need to figure out the
chances of the threat exploiting the vulnerability and the consequences if that does happen. Be familiar with the
approaches:
 Qualitative. This method uses a risk analysis matrix and assigns a risk value such as low, medium or high.
For example, if the likelihood is rare and the consequences are low, then the risk is low. If the likelihood is
almost certain and the consequences are major, then the risk is extreme.
 Quantitative. This method is more objective than the qualitative method; it uses dollars or other metrics
to quantify risk.
 Hybrid. A mix of qualitative and quantitative. If you can easily assign a dollar amount, you do; if not, you
don’t. This can often provide a good balance between qualitative and quantitative.
 Respond to risk. You must formulate a plan of action for each risk you identify. For a given risk, you can choose
risk mitigation (reduce the risk), risk assignment (assign the risk to a team or provider for action), risk acceptance
(accept the risk) or risk rejection (ignore the risk).
Outside of the three primary steps for applying risk management, you should familiarize yourself with some of the details
for those three steps:
 Countermeasure selection and implementation. You can use a software or hardware solution to reduce a
particular risk by implementing a countermeasure, sometimes referred to as a “control” or a “safeguard.” Suppose
you have a password policy that a legacy application cannot technically meet (for example, the app is limited to 10
characters for the password). To reduce the likelihood of that password being compromised, you can implement
any of several countermeasures: For instance, you can require that the password be changed more frequently than
other (longer) passwords, or mandate that the password be stored in a secure password vault that requires twofactor authentication. For your exam preparation, don’t just understand the words and definitions; understand
how you implement the concepts in your environment. You don’t have to provide a step-by-step technical
configuration, but you must understand the implementation process — where you start, the order of the steps you
take and how you finish.
 Applicable types of controls. Be familiar with the 6 types of controls:
 Preventive. This type of control is intended to prevent a security incident from happening. For example,
