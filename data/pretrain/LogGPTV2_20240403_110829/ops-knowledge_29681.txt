User: Please explain the common network attack methods? How to avoid these attacks?
Assistant: Common network attack methods are as follows: 1. DDoS attack: flooding the server with a large amount of traffic, making it unable to work normally, so that its service is unavailable. 2. SQL injection attack: use input loopholes, inject malicious code, bypass authentication and other restrictions, access and manipulate the database. 3. XSS attack: Inject malicious scripts into the website, tamper with website content, steal user information, etc. 4. Cross-site request forgery: The attacker sends a forged request to the server to tamper with user data or control user accounts through the user's logged-in status. 5. E-mail fraud: By forging e-mails, defrauding user information, allowing users to pay or share sensitive information. The methods to avoid these attacks are as follows: 1. Build a firewall to limit access to prevent network intrusion and DOS attacks. 2. Strengthen system security, close loopholes, avoid SQL injection, XSS attacks and CSRF attacks. 3. Strengthen password management, strengthen password policies, and prevent password disclosure and guessing. 4. Email filtering technology prevents email fraud and verifies sender identity and email content. 5. Improve employee security awareness, strengthen social engineering and fraud prevention training.
