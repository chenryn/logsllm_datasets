Run once pods are not well accounted for by the current quota system, because
run-always pods can absorb the quota and prevent jobs from running (builds,
scheduled tasks). We discussed today a "pods per unit time" measure with "max
run once pods" that allow for users to run short jobs in parallel or over a
longer time.
Since run always pods are typically "run up to N pods that run 24 hours a
day", it's natural to want to state "run up to 3 pods at most 6 hours a day".
Whether that is 6 hours for one pod or 2 hours for each of 3, the end metric
would be applied. This may be continually refilling (useful).
