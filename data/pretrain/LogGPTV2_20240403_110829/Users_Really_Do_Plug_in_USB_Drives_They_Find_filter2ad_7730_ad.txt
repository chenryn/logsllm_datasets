TABLE IX: SeBIS Results—We compare items with different (p < 0.1) responses to items in the SeBIS in both Egelman and
Peer’s study [4] and the USB experiment and between the school survey and the USB experiment. College students appear to
have different security knowledge proﬁles than a general population.
Questionc
I set my computer screen to automatically lock if I don’t use it for a prolonged
period of time.
I use a password/passcode to unlock my laptop or tablet.
I manually lock my computer screen when I step away from it.
I use a PIN or passcode to unlock my mobile phone.
I do not change my passwords, unless I have tor.
I use different passwords for different accounts that I have.
I do not include special characters in my password if it’s not requiredr.
When someone sends me a link, I open it without ﬁrst verifying where it goesr.
I submit information to websites without ﬁrst verifying that it will be sent securely
(e.g., SSL, “https://”, a lock icon)r.
When browsing websites, I mouseover links to see where they go, before clicking
them.
If I discover a security problem, I continue what I was doing because I assume
someone else will ﬁx itr.
When I’m prompted about a software update, I install it right away.
I try to make sure that the programs I use are up-to-date.

C. Social Media Response
During the experiment, we monitored social media sites (e.g.,
Facebook and Reddit) for any descriptions of the experiment.
At 11 am on the second day, a student posted a picture of
one of the ﬂash drives with attached keys to Facebook. Later
that day, at 1 pm, a user posted on the university sub-Reddit
about ﬁnding multiple drives on campus and stated that they
reported the incident to an IT group. Commenters conﬁrmed
the presence (and non-maliciousness) of the ﬂash drives and
speculated about the purpose of the study. Two users warned
readers to avoid plugging the devices into their computers. The
next day, a purported IT worker posted about the “Final Exam
Answers” and encouraged users not to plug in the drives.
We note that while news of the experiment spread quickly
and despite IT workers recommending against connecting the
drives, the attack was still largely successful.
D. Altruistic Experiences
Twice during the experiment, users returned ﬂash drives to
the researchers who were attempting to drop them. We consider
these incidents an effective display of altruism that underscores
the conclusions of this paper.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we showed that the anecdote that users will
pick up and plug in ﬂash drives they ﬁnd is true. In a controlled
experiment at the University of Illinois, we ﬁnd that the attack
both effective with an estimated 45%–98% of dropped drives
connected and expeditious with the ﬁrst drive connected in
under six minutes.
Users pick up the drives with altruistic intentions based
on the types of the drives that were connected, the ﬁles that
were opened, and the number of unconnected drives that were
returned to us. However, we simultaneously note that nearly
half of users are overtaken by curiosity, ﬁrst opening vacation
photos instead of the prominently placed résumé (which would
have reasonably included contact information). Contrary to
previous belief, intriguing drive labels do not increase the
attack’s success rate, but we do ﬁnd that by attaching keys to
the drive, more users return the drives and that by providing
a return label, users contact the owner directly instead of
connecting it.
The users who connect the drives do not belong to a unique
subpopulation—they are neither technically incompetent rela-
tive to their peers nor particularly risk loving compared to the
general population. Surprisingly, they are more risk averse than
the general population in all but one DOSPERT category—
recreational risk. Instead, we ﬁnd that many of the users believe
their computers will protect them and they are either not aware
of or are more tolerant of the actual risks of plugging in a
USB drive.
This evidence is a reminder to the security community that
less technical attacks remain a real-world threat and that we
have yet to understand how to successfully defend against
them. We need to better understand the dynamics of social
engineering attacks, develop better technical defenses against
them, and learn how to effectively teach end users about these
risks.
