User: Please install and configure Elasticsearch on a set of servers for data storage and retrieval.
Assistant: The following are the steps to install and configure Elasticsearch on a group of servers: 1. Preparatory work Before installing Elasticsearch, you need to check whether the Java environment has been installed. Elasticsearch requires Java 8 or higher to run. You can check the Java version by running the following command: ``` java -version ``` If the output contains information about Java 8 or above, Java is already installed. If Java is not installed, you need to download and install Java first. 2. Download and install Elasticsearch You can download the latest version of Elasticsearch from the official website of Elasticsearch. Once the download is complete, extract the zipped file into the target folder and rename it elasticsearch. 3. Configure Elasticsearch Enter the elasticsearch directory and edit the config/elasticsearch.yml file. Modify the following configuration items as needed: ``` cluster.name: To form an independent cluster, you need to set the same cluster name. node.name: Each node has its own name, which is randomly generated by default. It is recommended to assign an independent name to each node. path.data: Data storage directory. http.port: Elasticsearch's HTTP service listening port. discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: Set communication information between nodes, specify access node information. In addition, you need to create a data directory under the elasticsearch directory to store data. ``` 4. Start Elasticsearch You can run the following command to start Elasticsearch: ``` bin/elasticsearch ``` If everything is normal, you can visit http://localhost:9200/ in the browser, and the following information will be displayed: ``` { "name": "My Node Name", "cluster_name": "my_cluster_name", "version": { "number": "7.5.0", "build_flavor": "default", "build_type": "tar", " build_hash": "e9ccaed468e2fac2275a2a0ce710ba659748f56c", "build_date": "2019-11-26T01:06:52.518245Z", "build_snapshot": false, "lucene_version": "8.3.0", "minimum_ wire_compatibility_version": "6.8.0", "minimum_index_compatibility_version": "6.0.0-beta1" }, "tagline": "You Know, for Search" } ``` 5. Use Elasticsearch to send data to Elasticsearch through HTTP request to realize data storage. For example, the following request could create a document named 1 in an index named test: ``` POST /test/_doc/1 { "name": "John Doe", "text": "Hello World" } ` `` Data can be retrieved from the index using the following request: ``` GET /test/_search { "query": { "match": { "text": "Hello" } } } ``` Steps to install and configure Elasticsearch above. It can be modified and expanded according to actual needs.
