User: Briefly explain the principles and functions of DNS in the Internet, and the role of DNS cache.
Assistant: DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that resolves the correspondence between domain names and IP addresses on the Internet. On the Internet, each website has a unique IP address, but people are more accustomed to using domain names to access websites. The role of DNS is to query the corresponding IP addresses based on domain names, so that users can access websites through easy-to-remember domain names. The principle of DNS is to decompose the domain name into multiple parts, and query them one by one from right to left until the final IP address is found. The specific process is: the client requests the DNS server and asks for the IP address of the target host; if the DNS server knows the target IP address, it returns immediately; if it does not know, it sends an inquiry to the root server and returns the address of the next-level DNS server ; Inquire in turn until the target IP address is found, and then return to the client. The function of DNS cache is to reduce the time-consuming of DNS query. When a DNS server queries a specific domain name for the first time, it needs to query a higher-level DNS server to obtain the target IP address, and this process takes time. However, if the DNS server caches the query results, the next time a user queries the same domain name, it can directly query the cache results without re-querying, thereby shortening the query time. The cache time can be set, and generally the cache time is short to ensure the accuracy of the query.
