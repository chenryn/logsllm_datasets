I encountered an issue with the cursor visibility while using Atom on Ubuntu 14.04, which I installed from the WebUpd8 PPA. Here are the steps and observations:

1. I clicked on a row in the editor, and the cursor appeared.
2. I typed some text in English.
3. I switched the keyboard layout to Russian and continued typing.
4. The cursor remained visible during this process.
5. When I switched the keyboard layout back to English, the cursor disappeared.

System: Ubuntu 14.04
Atom: Installed from WebUpd8 PPA

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there is a known solution for this issue.
