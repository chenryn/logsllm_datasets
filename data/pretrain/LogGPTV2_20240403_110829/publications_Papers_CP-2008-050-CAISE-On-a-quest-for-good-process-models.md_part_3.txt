**Adjusted R² and CC Metric Evaluation:**
The adjusted R² value for the model is 45% (Nagelkerke’s coefficient of determination). To evaluate the Cross-Connectivity (CC) metric, it was integrated into the existing analysis. The following conclusions were drawn:

1. **Relation with Score:**
   - Similar to the five model factors identified in the original analysis, the CC metric exhibits the expected relationship with the score.

2. **Correlation Significance:**
   - Unlike the density and average connector degree factors, the correlation between the score and the CC metric (0.549) is not significant at a 95% confidence interval. The P-value of 0.065 slightly exceeds the 0.05 threshold.

3. **Explanatory Power:**
   - A regression model with significantly better explanatory power for the variation in scores can be developed by including the CC metric. The adjusted R² increased from 45% in the original model to 76% in the new regression model.
   - This improvement is achieved by combining the #or-joins, density, average connector degree, mismatch factors, and the CC metric.

A visualization of this regression model is provided in Figure 3.

**Implications:**
- The CC metric, on its own, is slightly less powerful as an indicator of process model understandability compared to the two best candidate metrics. However, when combined with existing metrics, it provides a superior explanation of the variation in understandability across models.

### Related Work

This section provides a brief overview of related work on business process metrics, which can be categorized into two main areas: process model metrics inspired by software measurement and experimental work on process model metrics. We focus particularly on metrics that consider overall structural aspects of the process model beyond simple count metrics. For a comprehensive overview, refer to [9,12,20,33].

**Early Development and Software Quality Metrics:**
- The early development of process model metrics was heavily influenced by software quality metrics, which aim to produce designs that are less error-prone, easier to comprehend, and easier to maintain. A survey of existing software metrics can be found in [14,35].
- Several studies have demonstrated the significant correlation between software quality metrics and errors in software design (e.g., [3,5,15,31,32]).
- In the 1990s, some works were primarily rooted in software quality measurement. For instance, Daneva et al. [10] introduced complexity indicators for Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs) based on visual attributes such as function cohesion, event cohesion, and cohesion of a logical connector. Their validation with 11 EPCs suggested that these metrics help identify error-prone model fragments.
- Morasca [25] proposed a set of simple metrics for software specifications designed with Petri-nets, focusing on size, length, structural complexity, and coupling without empirical validation.
- Reijers and Vanderfeesten extended this research by introducing a coupling-cohesion metric for guiding workflow process design [27,28], based on data flow and network structure rather than the process model itself.
- Vanderfeesten, Cardoso, and Reijers [34] proposed a weighted coupling metric, which assigns weights to different types of connections between activities in the process model. Although it lacks a thorough cognitive foundation, it served as a blueprint for the CC metric.
- Cardoso developed the Control Flow Complexity (CFC) metric [7], which was validated against Weyuker’s complexity axioms [6] and tested for its correlation with perceived complexity [8]. Unlike the CC metric, CFC does not consider connections between different model elements but focuses on routing elements in isolation.

**Experimental Approach:**
- Mendling et al. adopted an experimental approach to process model metrics, driven by the explanatory power of metrics in empirical settings. They tested 28 business process metrics, including size, density, structuredness, coefficient of connectivity, average connector degree, control flow complexity, and others, as error predictors on over 2000 process models [20,22]. All metrics, except for density and the maximum degree of a connector, were confirmed to be correlated with error-proneness as expected. Additionally, a logistic regression model was able to correctly classify 90% of the process models.
- A survey on the understandability of process models by Mendling, Reijers, and Cardoso [23] provided further insights, which are detailed in Section 3.2.

**Cognitive Dimensions:**
- While the metrics used in these experiments are theoretically motivated, most are not explicitly grounded in cognitive research. The CC metric, however, considers hard mental operations as defined in the cognitive dimensions framework [11] as the primary factor driving the understanding of a process model.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we motivated, formalized, and validated the Cross-Connectivity (CC) metric for process models. The metric quantifies how tightly the nodes in a process model are connected, using a weakest-link metaphor. It assumes that a higher value is associated with easier model understanding, implying a lower error probability. Our evaluation shows that the CC metric performs similarly well as the best available alternative model metrics. Moreover, our results suggest that the CC metric adds a new cognitive perspective to process model quality, enhancing explanatory power when combined with existing metrics.

Reflecting on the development of business process model metrics, it is clear that this is a field in progress. Initially, proposals for process model metrics were highly conceptual, based on the idea that if metrics are useful for analyzing software programs, they should also be applicable to process models. Today, we have advanced to the stage where model metrics are being empirically tested for their real-world effectiveness. The strong performance of the CC metric indicates that a more cognitive theoretical stance is needed to advance the field of process model measurement.

Overall, feedback from empirical validations has improved the quality of process model metrics. Recent works, such as [20,22] and this paper, perform much better in explaining the variation in understanding and the occurrence of errors in process models. In future work, we aim to evaluate model quality metrics on a larger scale, considering a wider set of real-world models. We are collaborating with consultancy companies that practice process modeling daily. Given that most empirical research has been conducted with EPC models, we are particularly interested in BPMN and Petri-net process models. Additionally, we are investigating other factors that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of process model quality, such as the visual layout of the process model graph and the importance of preliminary knowledge about the domain captured in the model. Our ultimate goal is to develop a set of concrete guidelines for process modelers, supported by solid theoretical foundations and empirical evidence, to help create better process models in practice.
