A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
This is my first time using Superset and I followed the instructions here  
https://superset.apache.org/installation.html#start-with-docker
### Expected results
I was able to clone and run `docker-compose up` successfully.  
I opened `http://localhost:8088` on my browser and entered `admin` for both
username and password.
### Actual results
I got an `Invalid login. Please try again.` message
