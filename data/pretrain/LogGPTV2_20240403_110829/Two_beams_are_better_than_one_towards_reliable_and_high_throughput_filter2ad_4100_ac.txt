if multiple paths exist in practical mmWave channels, and if so,
how strong are they? There are numerous measurement studies
that indicate the presence of strong multipath at both 28 GHz and
60 GHz [5, 18, 30, 44–46]. These studies show that in a typical de-
ployment, reflectors like metals, concrete walls, and tinted glass
strongly reflect signals while attenuating them by about 5-6 dB
(𝛿 ≈ 0.5). In addition, we perform a measurement study of reflector
strengths at various indoor (5m-10m link) and outdoor (10m-80m
link) locations (Overall 10K data points). At each location, we per-
form a full 120o scan to identify the distribution of signal strength
across space. Shown in Fig. 4(a), common reflectors cause 1-10 dB
attenuation (relative to the direct path) with a median attenuation
of 7.2 dB indoors and 5 dB outdoors. Fig. 4(b) shows a particular
data point where signal strengths along all angles are evaluated
during user motion. Sometimes, reflectors as strong as the direct
path exist and can be utilized to establish a multi-beam link.
3.3 Creating constructive multi-beam
So far, we have established that constructive multi-beam is the
optimal beamforming technique for a typical mmWave channel. To
achieve optimal beamforming, we need to estimate the channel h[𝑛]
at each antenna at the gNB, the complexity of which scales with
the total number of antennas. In sub-6 GHz communication, the
channel at each antenna is readily measured as each antenna could
be connected to a separate RF chain. In contrast, mmWave hardware
usually consists of a single RF chain attached to a large phased
array with many antennas. Performing channel estimations for
each antenna element is intractable in practical mmWave systems.
The intuition behind constructive multi-beam is that it opti-
mally uses the available multipath. We make the key observation
492
(10)
The denominator ensures that the TRP is conserved by enforcing
∥w∥ = 1. We then appropriately quantize the beamforming vector
phases & amplitudes to be compatible with our phased array. In [34],
a sub-optimal multi-beam is created by splitting the array into
sub-arrays, each responsible for a particular component beam. In
contrast, mmReliable utilizes phase and amplitude control to create
the optimal channel-dependent multi-beam.
■ Estimating parameters for constructive multi-beam: Reli-
ably estimating the parameters to establish a multi-beam is integral
to maintaining its constructive nature. In the two-beam case, we
need to estimate 𝛿 (relative attenuation, 𝛿 ∈ R+) and 𝜎 (relative
phase shift, 0 < 𝜎 ≤ 2𝜋) of the reflected path w.r.t. the direct path.
We already know the directions 𝜙1, 𝜙2 of the two paths from the
beam-training phase. We denote the narrow-band complex wireless
channel along each path as ℎ1 and ℎ2, respectively. If the gNB mea-
sures both ℎ1 and ℎ2, then it can estimate the relative amplitude
and phase shift using their ratio. A simple method would be to
measure each beam’s channel one-by-one by setting the beam to
𝜙1 and then 𝜙2, as suggested in [34]. However, hardware offsets
such as Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and Sampling Frequency
Offset (SFO) cause time-varying and sometimes unpredictable chan-
nel phases, making these channel estimates unreliable [14, 47, 48].
The channel magnitude is the one thing that remains fixed despite
these offsets. Therefore, we develop an estimation method using
channel magnitude alone. First, we observe that only the relative
channel between the two beams is of interest to us, which means
that we can treat ℎ1 as a reference and assume ℎ1 ∈ R+ without
loss of generality. Then, we observe that the magnitudes 𝑝1 = |ℎ1|2
and 𝑝2 = |ℎ2|2 are already available from the initial beam-training
phase. Now, we develop a method to estimate their ratio using just
two extra channel probes. Shown in Fig. 5, the gNB uses two RS
to probe two 2-beam patterns: first it sets the beam 𝑤(𝜙1, 𝜙2, 1, 0),

where { ˆ𝛿, ˆ𝜎} are the estimates of the relative amplitude and phase
respectively between the two multi-beam paths. Thus, our algo-
rithm estimates the required parameters using only two consecutive
RS probes for the two-beam case. The algorithm can be generalized
to any 𝐾 multi-beam by performing two probes for each additional
beam and solving Eq. (12) to yield 𝐾 − 1 relative channels w.r.t ℎ1.
In [14], the authors develop a similar technique, albeit for mea-
suring the per-element channel in a phased array. The channel
probing overhead in [14] is proportional to the number of anten-
nas 𝑁 (≈ 5𝑁 ). In contrast, our solution to measure the per-beam
channel requires 2(𝐾 − 1) + 𝐾 probes for 𝐾 beams (including the
𝐾 estimates from the beam-training phase) and is independent of
the number of antenna elements in the phased array; making it
tractable for large arrays.
■ Handling wideband channels: Typically, the Channel State
Information (CSI) is measured across multiple frequency subcarriers
over a wide bandwidth. The CSI is readily available for the 5G NR
system from the reference signal [1]. Even for 802.11ad commercial
routers, the CSI can be extracted in the firmware [2, 14, 49]. The
prior analysis can easily be extended to multiple subcarriers by
simply treating each subcarrier’s channel independently. We denote
h1(𝑓 ) and h2(𝑓 ) as the wideband CSI across frequency index 𝑓 . We
first estimate h1(𝑓 ), h2(𝑓 ) using Eq.(12). Then, we formulate an
optimization problem that maximizes the average received signal
strength overall frequencies to jointly estimate { ˆ𝛿, ˆ𝜎} as:
{ ˆ𝛿, ˆ𝜎} = arg max
(13)
We solve the above to obtain a closed form solution (⟨·, ·⟩ is the

which reduces, as expected, to ˆ𝛿𝑒 𝑗 ˆ𝜎 = ℎ2/ℎ1 for a narrowband chan-
nel (e.g. in IEEE 802.11ad 60 GHz standard [32]). The optimal phase,
amplitude, & angle will change over time as the user moves. We pe-
riodically estimate these parameters using our tracking algorithm
discussed in the next section.

4 Proactive multi-beam tracking
Once a constructive multi-beam is established, mmReliable main-
tains it over time to honor the goal of reliable mmWave commu-
nication. The purpose of beam maintenance is to keep a high-
throughput link even when the user is mobile or sees a random
blockage. One choice for beam maintenance could be to period-
ically repeat the set of procedures in Section 3.3 to re-establish
constructive multi-beam with a mobile user. However, it will re-
quire repeating the beam-training phase, which incurs significant
delays and probing overhead (Section 2.2). We observe that the ef-
fect of blockage and mobility is embedded naturally in the form of
variations in the wireless channel. Thus, our approach is to leverage
OFDM channel estimate and reference signaling to maintain a multi-
beam link and avoid impending blockage and mobility events while
the communication link is active. We show the overall functioning
of mmReliable using a flow-chart in Fig. 6. mmReliable continu-
ously monitors the OFDM channel to identify blockage or mobility
on a per-beam basis. User mobility is tracked in the background,
and the multi-beam is refined periodically with a low-overhead.
When the beam is no longer recoverable by tracking alone (due to
accumulated errors in tracking over time), mmReliable re-calibrates
the system using the beam training phase.
4.1 Proactive Blockage Mitigation
Mobile blockers interact with the multi-beam system by suddenly
occluding one or more active beams. mmReliable analyzes the rate
of change of amplitude per beam to detect such events. Empiri-
cal evaluation shows that typical blockage events cause per-beam
amplitude to degrade by 10 dB in just 10 OFDM symbols. Once a
blockage event is detected, mmReliable responds by re-purposing
the power on the blocked beam to other unblocked ones. Since
there are always multiple beams active, there is no significant im-
pact on link reliability, even if one is blocked. Said differently, the
transceiver reduces the number of beams whenever blockage is
detected along some paths. It is rare that all paths are blocked si-
multaneously; nonetheless, in case of a complete outage, the radio
can initiate a new beam training phase to search for other alternate
paths or perform a handover [24].
4.2 Proactive User-Mobility Management
When the user is mobile, the initial multi-beam may no longer be
supported. A mere angular movement of 14o would cause a 20dB
loss in signal strength leading to outage. A natural solution is to re-
quest a new beam training to locate the new user position, but beam

training causes high overhead in tedious scanning. We propose to
proactively track the user mobility using channel measurements
and refine the beam periodically. Traditional in-band tracking based
on single-beam is not applicable to mmReliable since each beam
in multi-beam may undergo different angular deviation making it
challenging for tracking as shown in Figure 7.
Our insight is that we can track each beam by observing the
gradual changes in per-beam power. We propose a model driven
approach to estimate per-beam angular deviation from the per-
beam power measurements, 𝑃𝑘(𝑡) given by
𝑃𝑘(𝑡) = 𝐺𝑇 (𝜙𝑘 + 𝜑𝑘(𝑡)) + 𝐺𝑅 + 𝑃𝑇 − 𝑃ℎ (in dB).
(15)
where 𝐺𝑇 (𝜙𝑘 + 𝜑𝑘(𝑡)) and 𝐺𝑅 are transmit and receive gain re-
spectively, where initial angle 𝜙𝑘 changes by 𝜑𝑘(𝑡) over time, 𝑃𝑇 is
transmit power, and 𝑃ℎ is power decay due to channel impairments.
We take the difference 𝑃𝑘(𝑡0) − 𝑃𝑘(0) to find the relative change in
the per-beam power as:
𝑃𝑘(𝑡0) − 𝑃𝑘(0) = 𝐺𝑇 (𝜙𝑘 + 𝜑𝑘(𝑡0)) − 𝐺𝑇 (𝜙𝑘)
(16)
where we assume that the channel loss 𝑃ℎ (due to path loss or
reflection loss) and receiver gain 𝐺𝑅 of omni-user is static for the
small duration of user motion. Now, to estimate 𝜑𝑘(𝑡0), our insight
is that the direct path power correlates with the beam pattern at
the gNB, which is a function of spatial angle:
𝐺𝑇 (𝜃) =
sin(𝑁𝜃/2)
𝑁 sin(𝜃)
(17)
where 𝑁 is the number of antennas in a uniform linear array and 𝜃 is
spatial angle. Therefore, we can use an inverse function to estimate
the angle from the measured per-beam power. However, the beam
pattern is usually symmetric, and two possible values 𝜑(𝑡0) and
−𝜑(𝑡0) could have caused the observed change in 𝐺𝑇 . To deal with
the ambiguity of the direction of motion, mmReliable tries one of
the two possibilities using reference signal probing in the hope that
it improves the SNR. If the probe doesn’t improve SNR, possibly
the other angle is correct, and thus, mmReliable refines the beam to
that angle. The refinement adds an overhead of only one additional
probe in addition to 2(𝐾 −1) probes required for constructive multi-
beam for the K-beam case. mmReliable periodically estimates the
value of the per-beam angle, phase, and amplitude and updates the
beam pattern at the gNB to realign towards the user.
4.3 Superresolution: Per-Beam Tracking
Here we describe how mmReliable estimates the per-beam power
required for the tracking algorithm. A simple solution would be
to scan single-beams in all 𝐾 directions and observe the corre-
sponding signal strengths. But, such scanning is intractable due
to high overhead in acquiring fine-grained power estimates for
efficient tracking. Our idea is to estimate per-beam power using

the channel impulse response (CIR) of the current multi-beam in
the background without any tedious scanning. When receiving a
multi-beam transmission, it can be shown that the signal at the
receiver consists of a superposition of a delayed and attenuated ver-
sion of each individual transmit beam. If we consider the delay and
attenuation experienced by beam-index 𝑘 as 𝛿𝑘 and 𝛼𝑘 respectively,
