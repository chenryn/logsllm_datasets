After  the  POD  controller  is  applied  to  the  system,  the 
dominant  eigenvalues  are  listed  in  Table  IV  for  each  input 
signal  separately.  It  shows  that  all  input  signals  have  the 
potential  to  improve  power  system  stability,  hence  all  are 
possible input signals for the POD controller.

The  damping  performance  of  each  signal  is  plotted  in 
figure  7.  As  can  been  seen,  using  power  flow  at  bus  8  as 
input  provides  the  best  control  performance.  The  order  of 
priority  of  the  input  signals  to  the  POD  controller  is 
determined  as  (from  high  priority  to  low  priority):

the voltage signals are out of the candidate signals list for the 
POD  Controller.  The  three  power  flow  signals  are  instead 
chosen as input signals to the POD controller. 
D. Stateful Data Delivery Service for POD Controller 
A SDDS based POD controller, called State Aware POD 
(SAPOD)  controller,  is  presented  in  this  section.  The 
SAPOD enables the controller to switch different input data 
based  on  SP  information  on  link  latency  and  choose  the 
proper  signal  input  for  the  POD  controller  as  described  in 
Section III. 
This  SAPOD  controller  is  used  in  the  experiment  as 
shown  in  Figure  8.  SAPOD  contains  three  POD  blocks,  as 
shown  in  Figure  6,  and  one  selector  which  decides  which 
input  signal  is  used  according  to  SP  command.  The  output 
signal of the SAPOD is connected to the POD signal input of 
the SVC voltage regulator as shown in Figure 5.

C. Latency Effect on the POD Controller 
To find the effect of latency on the control performance, 
a transport delay is added between the measured signal and 
POD  signal  input  port.  By  means  of  testing,  latency 
requirement  of  each  input  signal  is  obtained.  The  detailed 
latency requirement of the POD controller is given in Table 
V. When the latency exceeds the specified requirement, the 
POD controller is not able to control the oscillations.

As  shown  in Table  V,  voltage  signals  have  the  strictest 
requirement on data delivery latency even to such a degree

with power flow, using voltage signals as input do not give 
better control performance as shown in figure 7. Therefore,

E. Experiment Setup 
The  power  system,  SAPOD  controller,  and  SP  are  all 
modeled in SIMULINK Tool. 
Figure 9.  Stateful data delivery service provider and SAPOD. 
SP  identifies  the  real  time  latency  of  each  input  signal 
and  chooses  the  signal  which  has  the  highest  priority  and 
fulfills  the  latency  requirement  listed  in  Table  V.  Only  the 
chosen  signal  output  is  used  to  obtain  the  SAPOD  output 
signal.  It  should  be  mentioned  SP  might  take  some 
processing time to switch from one input signal to another. 
Therefore, a switching latency of 1 second is introduced in 
the model. 
F. Result 
In  the  experiment,  the  latency  of  the power  flow  signal 
from bus 8 stays 0.2s until 103s simulation second. Then it 
increases to 0.5s. The latency of the power flow signal from 
bus  7  stays  0.4s  all  the  time.  Firstly,  we  test  the  system 
without  the  SDDS.  Only  one  signal, 
8BP ,  is  used.  Two 
communication latency scenarios are tested, 200 and 500 ms. 
The  results  are  shown  in  the  upper  half  and  lower  half  of 
Figure  10  respectively.  From  the  result,  we  find  that  the 
power system is stable after the fault, when the input signal

has  latency  of  200ms.  However,  when  the  input  signal  has 
larger latency such as 500ms, the system is unstable. In this 
case,  the  simulation  is  stopped  at  115.7  s  due  to  one 
generator losing synchronization. In this case, POD without 
SDDS is not able to keep the system stable. 
Figure 10. Power flow at bus 9 when POD input latency is 200ms and 
500ms (only power flow at bus 8 is used as POD input). 
The result of using SAPOD and SP is presented in Figure 
11.  From  top  to  bottom,  figures  present  power  flow 
measured at bus 9, SAPOD signal selected number, latency

experiment. According to Table V, signal 2 cannot fulfill the 
QoS requirement after 103 s. Therefore, the SP switches the 
input signal of ASPOD from signal 2 to signal 1 at 104 s (1s 
for switching delay). The power flow measured from bus 9 
shows that the system is well damped by SAPOD instead of 
instability as in the first case with POD without SDDS. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper has presented a Stateful Data Delivery Service 
for power system applications. The SDDS focuses on using 
real  time  data  link  performance  information  to  provide 
power  system  application  with  data  according  to  their  QoS 
requirements. The paper describes how the SP interacts with 
a power system application in detail. In the study, we have 
used a POD controller as a candidate application to verify the 
773
latency  exceeds 
in  cases  where 
design and show the benefits of the SDDS. The result shows 
the  SDDS  can  increase  the  reliability  of  the  application 
performance  compared  to  an  application  without  data  link 
state  awareness 
the 
requirements.  The  success  of  the  SDDS  provides  a  new 
thinking  of  power  system  application  design.  Except  using 
the single input signal (or single group of input signals) with 
high  tolerant  range  of  QoS,  using  multi-input  signals  (or 
multiple groups of input signals) can increase the tolerance 
of  application  to  latency  problems,  complete  data  source 
failure, and some data link failure cases. To the applications 
similar to POD in this paper, they can be modified as a state 
awareness application simply.
