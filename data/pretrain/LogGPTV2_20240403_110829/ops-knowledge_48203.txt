User: I am very very new to Python. I am trying to get a python program to run by writing 'python hello.py' but every time I do that I get a Syntax Error. Why is that?
However when I open the file and click on run module, it works. Why won't it work if I type 'python hello.py'
Is there anyway I can navigate to the directory where the file is stored and then run it? I tried placing my file in directly in the Python23 folder :P didnt work anyway 
Please help me. I have Python 2.3.5
Assistant: I'm guessing that you're running python hello.py within the Python REPL. This won't work; python hello.py is something that starts Python that you'll need to run in your system shell.
