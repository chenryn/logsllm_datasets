Abstract
Commercial threat intelligence is thought to provide un-
matched coverage on attacker behavior, but it is out of reach
for many organizations due to its hefty price tag. This paper
presents the ﬁrst empirical assessment of the services of com-
mercial threat intelligence providers. For two leading vendors,
we describe what these services consist of and compare their
indicators with each other. There is almost no overlap be-
tween them, nor with four large open threat intelligence feeds.
Even for 22 speciﬁc threat actors – which both vendors claim
to track – we ﬁnd an average overlap of only 2.5% to 4.0%
between the indicator feeds. The small number of overlapping
indicators show up in the feed of the other vendor with a delay
of, on average, a month. These ﬁndings raise questions on
the coverage and timeliness of paid threat intelligence.
We also conducted 14 interviews with security profession-
als that use paid threat intelligence. We ﬁnd that value in this
market is understood differently than prior work on quality
metrics has assumed. Poor coverage and small volume appear
less of a problem to customers. They seem to be optimiz-
ing for the workﬂow of their scarce resource – analyst time –
rather than for the detection of threats. Respondents evaluate
TI mostly through informal processes and heuristics, rather
than the quantitative metrics that research has proposed.
1 INTRODUCTION
Cyber threat intelligence (TI) has acquired a strong presence
in the market for security services. TI is, simply put, infor-
mation on attacker behavior that can be used to adapt one’s
defenses to the threat landscape. A well-known form of TI
are indicators of compromise (IOCs): machine-readable data
feeds with resources – typically IP addresses, domains, or
ﬁle hashes – that have been observed in malicious behavior.
Commercial vendors also regularly release analyst-focused
reports which go beyond indicators and paint a picture of the
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of speciﬁc actors.
While organizations can generate limited forms of TI from
their internal systems, they increasingly turn to procuring TI
from external sources. Roughly speaking, there are three
sources of TI: open, shared and paid. Open TI (OTI) typi-
cally consists of public lists of indicators, such as Abuse.ch
[1], AlienVault [3], and Malwaredomains.com [12]. Here,
threat intelligence is often another name for abuse feeds and
blacklists. Shared TI (STI) is sourced via trusted communi-
ties where members exchange their own threat information,
and where there is no payment associated with this exchange.
The community can be formalized, such as the membership
in an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), or
it can be informal, where membership is based on personal
trust relationships. The third source is paid TI (PTI). A 2019
survey amongst 1,908 IT and security professionals in North
America and the U.K. found that 44% of respondents say that
the primary source of threat intelligence in their organization
is purchased [31]. The commercial market for TI products
and services is valued at over USD 5 billion globally and
predicted to triple in the next ﬁve years [22].
Despite its importance, the commercial market for TI is
largely uncharted territory in academic research. In light of
the high fees and license restrictions associated with PTI,
this is understandable. The nearest work, conducted by Li
et al. [21], was not focused on PTI speciﬁcally, but did in-
clude two edge cases of paid services. These services did not
provide original TI sources, but helped curate and aggregate
otherwise free or low-end indicator feeds. They were priced
in the range of USD 1-10k per year. In this paper, we focus
on high-end, original TI sources from market leaders, which
charge around USD 100-650k per year (Section 5.2). Except
for the edge cases, prior research has analyzed only open
sources in the form of abuse feeds and blacklists. Recent
work [21, 15] conﬁrmed the results of earlier studies [39, 25,
19]: the feeds are highly heterogeneous, overlap among any
two feeds is often very small and never more than 10%, and
the feeds are dominated by ‘singletons’; entries that do not
appear in any other feeds. This also explains why, in order
to achieve better coverage of their threats, network defenders
combine on average 7.7 TI sources [31].
No prior work has analyzed what TI services the high-

end vendors in the commercial market offer, how their data
compares to OTI and how customers evaluate PTI. This lack
of insight also affects ﬁrms facing security investment make
decisions. The subscription fees of the market leaders usually
range in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year [20].
Buyers have to decide if these substantial costs are worth it
compared to open or shared TI. According to research ﬁrms
Gartner and Forrester, purchasers are struggling to compare
services [20, 14]. Prior work [21, 33, 29, 24, 27, 15] assumed
that buyers are in need of quantitative metrics on criteria like
coverage, volume, accuracy, and timeliness. This assumption,
however, has not been empirically validated via a user study.
This paper reports on a mixed-method study that sheds
light on the market for paid TI and reduces the information
asymmetry currently confronting buyers. We present the ﬁrst
qualitative and quantitative analysis of commercial TI ser-
vices. Using grounded theory, we analyze 14 interviews with
PTI customers to understand what sources they are buying,
how they use them and how they evaluate added value in the
absence of independent analyses. We complement this user
study with a high-level quantitative analysis of services of two
market leaders, comparing these to several open TI feeds.
With this approach, we aim to answer the following ques-
tions: (i) What do paid TI services consist of? (ii) How is
paid TI different from open TI? (iii) How do customers use
TI and perceive value? We make the following contributions:
(cid:4) We present the ﬁrst empirical analysis of paid TI from
market leaders, comparing the data of two leading vendors
to each other and to OTI.
(cid:4) We demonstrate that there is almost no overlap between
paid and open TI sources, signaling that they capture a
different part of the threat landscape. Surprisingly, there
is also little overlap among the two paid feeds, although
they focus on the same topic areas. Even when tracking
the same 22 threat actors, only 2.5 % to 4.0% of indica-
tors are found by both vendors, depending on the type of
indicator. Timeliness, as measured on the small overlap
among sources, shows delays of more than a month be-
tween sources. These ﬁndings suggest serious issues with
coverage and timeliness of commercial TI.
(cid:4) We ﬁnd that customers use TI less exclusively for network
detection than is often assumed. Other use cases include
understanding of the threat landscape, informing business
decisions, awareness programs, and threat hunting.
(cid:4) Where prior work has assumed that customers work with
metrics like coverage in order to evaluate TI, we ﬁnd a
different logic in practice. Customers value the better
curated and more selective paid TI sources over other
sources – especially the larger and potentially more noisy
open sources – because they consume less analyst time.
Surprisingly, the fact that smaller sets may also imply
more false negatives, i.e., limited coverage, is much less a
concern. Costs hardly play a role at all.
2 BACKGROUND
A major challenge in an organization’s risk management pro-
cess is to identify and understand all relevant threats. For
many cybersecurity threats, their existence, likelihood and
impact are not known to the organization. Threat intelligence
services claim to address this by providing the necessary infor-
mation to identify risks, aid in their quantiﬁcation, guide the
selection of controls, provide indicators to detect adversaries,
and show possible courses of action.
To a limited extent, TI can be extracted from an organi-
zation’s own security controls. Think of ﬁrewall logs that
observe external IP addresses involved in brute-forcing SSH
passwords or of spam ﬁlters that contain emails with phishing
URLs. Such IP addresses and URLs are typically referred to
as indicators of compromise (IOCs). The downside of pro-
ducing in-house TI is that any single organization will only
observe a small fraction of the threat landscape. Another chal-
lenge is that extracting the most relevant signals, rather than
the most obvious ones, requires resources and expertise. For
this reason, many organizations acquire external sources of
threat intelligence, like open sources or sharing communities.
Compared to OTI and STI, paid threat intelligence makes
a different value proposition. It does not only contain in-
dicators and information observed from an ongoing threat
somewhere else (e.g., an IP address that has brute-forced or
phished a different organization), but insights based on active
research, proprietary vantage points, and potentially insider
information by a specialized provider. PTI is often perceived
as being of higher quality and providing better and earlier
warning. To protect value and exclusivity, vendors typically
vet their customers, so that adversaries cannot readily see that
their activities were detected. Vendors also typically provide
integration into products, like a malware detection middlebox.
This provides them with unique visibility across the networks
of their clients, where they have probes for monitoring and
middleboxes for protection. The vendors in this market typ-
ically claim that with these vantage points and cloud-based
aggregation and analysis of data, they can track advanced
attacks and threat actors. Vincenzo Iozzo, Senior Director
at CrowdStrike, a key player in this market, articulated this
advantage as follows: “If you [the attacker] get detected
on one machine, all of your offensive infrastructure has to
be scrapped” [17]. Later in this paper, we explore the ex-
tent to which this advantage allows PTI vendors to uncover
offensive infrastructure.
In general, assessing quality of TI data through metrics is
very hard, as there is no ground truth on global maliciousness
[25]. Below we brieﬂy describe some quality characteristics
and metrics that were developed in earlier work, as these
concepts return at various points in the paper.
Coverage pertains to the proportion in which the TI ac-
tually observes the attacks it promises to observe – i.e., the
proportion to which the intended indicators are actually con-

tained in the feed [21, 29]. The opposite is how much relevant
information it fails to provide, which is the rate of false nega-
tives [24, 27, 25].
Accuracy is the proportion of indicators in a feed that
actually belong in the feed. This pertains to the degree of
true positives. Its opposite is the degree of false positives [21,
24, 27] and this a major factor in the value of a data-source.
Depending on the organization, even a relatively low number
of false positives may lead to notiﬁcation fatigue and thereby
reduce the feed value.
Timeliness of information in a feed pertains to the time
gap between an attack vector occurring and its associated
indicators being included in the feed [28]. Some authors
refer to this as latency [21], or speed [24]. Timeliness may
be essential for the value of a feed used in active defense
mechanisms, e.g., intrusion detection middle boxes, but for
forensics purposes this is less critical.
Ingestibility relates to the structure and consistency of
structure in a feed [28], i.e., how well it can be automatically
processed.
Relevance of a TI feed [28], also referred to as ﬁtness [29],
describes how well the indicators and contents of a feed ﬁt an
organization’s use case. A TI feed rarely attempts to cover
all malicious activity but often focuses on a certain type of
threat. A feed may hence be of low value if it is not relevant
to an organization.
In summary, assessing the quality of TI feeds is a difﬁcult
subject for OTI, and–due to limited availability–even more so
for PTI. In the remainder of the paper, we will produce some
of these metrics for PTI, replicating the approach of [21]
(Sections 5 & 6), while also using interviews with users to see
how organizations assess the value of PTI with or without
such metrics (Section 6).
3 ETHICS
Research on PTI data is hindered by high fees and license
restrictions. Firms who buy a subscription are not allowed to
share the data with third parties, including researchers. We
were able to overcome this barrier when one of the authors
was set up as an intern in an organization that has a subscrip-
tion to the TI of two market leaders. These two vendors
are included in Gartner’s market overview [20] and they are
positioned among the most expensive suppliers. The analy-
sis of the data was conducted on the organization’s premises
and within the conditions of their vendor license agreements.
Only the aggregate results of the analysis were shared with
the rest of the author team. The organization was willing to
collaborate with our study on condition that we would not
name them nor the vendors included in the study, and that
we would not include characteristics of the feeds that would
make the vendors easily identiﬁable. Hence, some numbers
are reported as ranges rather than exact counts.
Our second data source consists of interviews with 14 secu-
rity professionals who work with paid threat intelligence. We
received approval from our Institutional Review Board for this
human-subjects research. All respondents explicitly gave their
consent to have their interview transcribed and used in this
study. To enable our respondents to talk about their use and
evaluation of PTI without risking reputational repercussions
for themselves or their organizations, we have anonymized
their identities. To provide context for speciﬁc quotes, we
describe a respondent’s role and sector. Respondents were
provided with information on the research objectives and
the interview protocol before the interview. Afterwards they
could check and correct quotes attributed to them.
4 METHODOLOGY
We use a mixed-methods approach, combining a qualitative
user study with a quantitative analysis of the TI data. To
answer the ﬁrst question – what does paid TI consist of? –
we report on the answers from our respondents, rather than
impose our own deﬁnition of TI. We complement these an-
swers with a high-level description of the feeds and reports
that were provided by two market leaders from 2013-2018.
For the second question – how PTI compares to OTI – we
analyzed indicator feeds of the two market leaders and four
open feeds. The third question – how do customers use TI
and perceive its value? – we answered based on our inter-
views. We answer the questions consecutively in Sections 5,
6, and 7. Here, we describe the data collection and analysis.
A high-level overview is presented in Table 1.
