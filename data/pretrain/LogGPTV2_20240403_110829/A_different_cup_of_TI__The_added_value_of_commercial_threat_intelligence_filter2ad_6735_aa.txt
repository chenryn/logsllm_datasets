## Abstract

Commercial threat intelligence (TI) is often touted for its comprehensive coverage of attacker behavior, yet it remains out of reach for many organizations due to its high cost. This paper presents the first empirical assessment of the services provided by commercial TI vendors. We analyze the offerings of two leading providers and compare their indicators with each other and with four large open-source TI feeds. Our findings reveal almost no overlap between the commercial feeds and the open-source feeds, and even for 22 specific threat actors that both vendors claim to track, the average overlap in indicators is only 2.5% to 4.0%. Furthermore, the few overlapping indicators typically appear in the feed of the other vendor with a delay of about one month. These results raise questions about the coverage and timeliness of paid TI.

We also conducted 14 interviews with security professionals who use paid TI. Our findings indicate that the value of TI in this market is understood differently than previously assumed. Poor coverage and small volume appear to be less of a concern for customers, who seem to prioritize optimizing the workflow of their scarce analyst resources rather than the detection of threats. Respondents evaluate TI primarily through informal processes and heuristics, rather than the quantitative metrics proposed in prior research.

## 1. Introduction

Cyber threat intelligence (TI) has become a significant component of the security services market. TI is, in essence, information on attacker behavior that can be used to adapt defenses to the evolving threat landscape. A common form of TI includes indicators of compromise (IOCs), which are machine-readable data feeds containing resources such as IP addresses, domains, or file hashes observed in malicious activities. Commercial vendors also provide analyst-focused reports that go beyond IOCs, detailing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of specific threat actors.

While organizations can generate some forms of TI from their internal systems, they increasingly rely on external sources. There are three primary sources of TI: open, shared, and paid. Open TI (OTI) typically consists of public lists of indicators, such as those provided by Abuse.ch, AlienVault, and Malwaredomains.com. Shared TI (STI) is sourced through trusted communities where members exchange threat information without financial transactions. The third source is paid TI (PTI). A 2019 survey of 1,908 IT and security professionals in North America and the U.K. found that 44% of respondents use purchased TI as their primary source. The global market for TI products and services is valued at over USD 5 billion and is expected to triple in the next five years.

Despite its importance, the commercial TI market remains largely unexplored in academic research. Previous studies have focused on open and shared TI, but there has been no comprehensive analysis of high-end, original TI sources from market leaders, which charge around USD 100-650k per year. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing the first qualitative and quantitative analysis of commercial TI services, comparing the data of two leading vendors to several open TI feeds, and understanding how customers use and evaluate TI.

## 2. Background

A key challenge in an organization's risk management process is identifying and understanding all relevant threats. Threat intelligence services aim to address this by providing the necessary information to identify risks, quantify them, guide the selection of controls, provide indicators for detecting adversaries, and suggest possible courses of action.

To a limited extent, TI can be extracted from an organization's own security controls, such as firewall logs and spam filters. However, any single organization will only observe a small fraction of the threat landscape, and extracting the most relevant signals requires significant resources and expertise. Therefore, many organizations turn to external sources of TI, such as open sources or sharing communities.

Paid TI offers a different value proposition compared to open and shared TI. It not only provides indicators and information observed from ongoing threats elsewhere but also insights based on active research, proprietary vantage points, and potentially insider information. PTI is often perceived as being of higher quality and providing better and earlier warnings. Vendors typically vet their customers to protect value and exclusivity and provide integration into products like malware detection middleboxes, giving them unique visibility across their clients' networks.

Assessing the quality of TI data is challenging, as there is no ground truth for global maliciousness. Key quality characteristics include:

- **Coverage**: The proportion of attacks that the TI actually observes.
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of indicators that actually belong in the feed.
- **Timeliness**: The time gap between an attack occurring and its indicators being included in the feed.
- **Ingestibility**: The structure and consistency of the feed.
- **Relevance**: How well the indicators and contents of a feed fit an organization's use case.

## 3. Ethics

Research on PTI data is hindered by high fees and license restrictions. To overcome these barriers, one of the authors interned at an organization with subscriptions to two leading TI vendors. The analysis was conducted on the organization's premises under the conditions of their vendor license agreements. The organization agreed to collaborate on the condition that their identity and the vendors' identities would remain anonymous, and that we would not include characteristics of the feeds that would make the vendors easily identifiable.

Our second data source consists of interviews with 14 security professionals who work with paid TI. The study received approval from our Institutional Review Board, and all respondents gave explicit consent for their interviews to be transcribed and used in the study. Their identities were anonymized to protect them and their organizations from reputational repercussions.

## 4. Methodology

We used a mixed-methods approach, combining a qualitative user study with a quantitative analysis of TI data. To answer the first question—what does paid TI consist of?—we relied on the responses from our interviewees, complemented by a high-level description of the feeds and reports provided by the two market leaders from 2013 to 2018. For the second question—how does PTI compare to OTI?—we analyzed indicator feeds from the two market leaders and four open feeds. The third question—how do customers use and perceive the value of TI?—was answered based on our interviews. The data collection and analysis methods are described below, and a high-level overview is presented in Table 1.
