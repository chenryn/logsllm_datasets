# Bug report
## Describe the bug
I'm doing a `router.push` using url, as, and passing query object in options
parameter.
When the page is rendered from the server side, the query string is processed
fine. However, when using `router.push`, query seems to be ignored.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
https://github.com/hgezim/nextjs-scrolll-custom-route-bug
  1. Clone https://github.com/hgezim/nextjs-scrolll-custom-route-bug/
  2. Checkout `query_param` branch
  3. Run `npm run dev`
  4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/recipes/diet-halal?cuisine=greek`
  5. Notice in the dev console that the query is set to `query L7: Object { cuisine: "greek", filter: "diet-halal" }`.
  6. Click the button labeled 95 on the page.
  7. Notice that `cuisine` isn't picked up here and it only shows `filter` parameter as part of query in dev console: `query L7: Object { filter: "diet-halal" }`
## Expected behavior
I expect the log statement to look the same when I press button `95`, namely:
`query L7: Object { cuisine: "greek", filter: "diet-halal" }`  
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
