in reality, everyone possesses different biometrics. Therefore, if we
used all of our personal biometrics, then fuzzy signatures should in-
tuitively be secure since it would be extremely hard to impersonate
someone. But obviously, collecting vast amount of biometrics from
a user will make the signing procedure very expensive and dras-
tically decrease user experience. The question is then, how much
entropy does a specific biometric have, and can it be used to securely
and efficiently instantiate fuzzy signatures?
This section can be divided into two parts: we first provide an
easy-to-state sufficient condition for “fuzzy signature compatible”
biometrics, and then we establish an experimental method to show
that a given biometric satisfies this condition.
6.1 Preparation
What is required from fuzzy biometrics? As we have seen in Secs. 4.2
and 5.4, the concrete values of FNMR and ConFMR of the fuzzy biomet-
rics dictate the applicability to fuzzy signatures. Recall the former
and latter correspond to the correctness and security of fuzzy sig-
natures, respectively:
False Non-Matching Rate (FNMR): Informally, this was the proba-
bility that two honestly generated fuzzy biometrics x and
x′ from the same user are “far”. Formally, FNMR := Pr[x ←
X, e ← Φ : x + e (cid:60) AR(x)].
Conditional False Matching Rate (ConFMR): Informally, this was the
collision probability of fuzzy biometrics conditioned on the
sketch being identical. Formally, ConFMR := Pr[x, x′ ←
X,(c, a) ← Sketch(x),((cid:101)c , ˜a) ← Sketch(x′) : x′ ∈ AR(x)| c =
(cid:101)c ], where recall Sketch is a deterministic algorithm. In par-
ticular, the probability is only over the randomness used to
sample x and x′.10
Observe that the values of FNMR and ConFMR are determined
uniquely by the following factors: the distribution X of fuzzy bio-
metrics, the definitions of the linear sketch, and the acceptance
region AR used by the linear sketch. Furthermore, observe that
X is implicitly defined by the concrete type of biometrics being
used, and the linear sketch only depends on the definition of AR
(or equivalently to the lattice as explained in Sec. 5). Therefore, AR
is the only parametric term that we can experimentally tune that
would affect the values of FNMR and ConFMR. Namely, the choice
of AR, which roughly is a metric for deciding whether two fuzzy
biometrics x and x′ are “similar", is the main term that determines
FNMR and ConFMR. As a rule of thumb, we like to define AR to be
efficiently computable and to reflect the actual closeness metric
of the underlying fuzzy biometric. For instance, if the closeness is
measured by the Euclidean metric, the hexagon AR may be better
than the square AR as in Fig. 9. (See also Sec. 5.3).
In real-world applications of fuzzy signature, we can typically
tolerate correctness error of at most 5% and security level of at least
112-bits. We can tolerate the correctness to be much larger than
the security level since we can simply retry till signing succeeds.
To summarize thus far, once we fix a (set of) biometrics, e.g.,
iris, fingerprint, and finger-vein, used by the fuzzy signature and a
description of the linear sketch scheme, the remaining issue is to
10For simplicity, we omit the randomness of the public parameter ppLS
.

considered to be close (left) or far (right) depending on AR.

define an appropriate acceptance region AR and show that the fuzzy
biometric provides FNMR ⪅ 5%(≈ 2−4.32) and ConFMR ⪅ 2−112.11 In
the following, we show how to experimentally estimate the values
of FNMR and ConFMR for a given definition of AR.
What kind of fuzzy biometrics is required for the experiment? For the
experiments, we assume a natural type of biometric dataset to be
provided: S = { x
is the j-th fuzzy
biometric of the i-th user.12 That is, S contains (ℓ + 1) fuzzy bio-
metrics from N users. Such a dataset can be collected in practice
by scanning each user i’s biometrics (ℓ + 1)-times. Looking ahead,

definition of AR for the specific dataset S. However, it is clear that
such an AR is overfitting to the particular dataset S and will not
generalize to unseen fuzzy biometrics X. Moreover, since typically,
such an AR cannot be computed efficiently we will not be able to
efficiently construct an associating linear sketch scheme or perform
the experiments explained below. Therefore, in practice, we use
natural definitions of AR as those explained in Sec. 5.
6.2 Estimating FNMR of Biometrics
We first estimate FNMR byFNMR. Given a dataset S of the above type,
we empirically calculateFNMR as follows:
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:8)x ∈ ¯S(i) | x (cid:60) AR(x
i∈[N](cid:12)(cid:12) ¯S(i)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where we assume AR is efficiently computable. It is easy to see that
the numerator counts all the fuzzy biometric of each user that does
not lie inside the acceptance region AR(x
6.3 Estimating ConFMR of Biometrics
Difficulty of estimation. We next estimate ConFMR byConFMR. Com-
putingConFMR experimentally turns out to be much harder com-
pared to computingFNMR. The main reason is the value of ConFMR
that we wish to evaluate is much smaller than FNMR; while we only
11Note that we need the additional condition that a linear sketch scheme with respect
to AR is efficiently constructible. We intentionally keep this requirement implicit to
make the presentation simple.

that ConFMR is smaller than 2−112 to be cryptographically useful. In
fact, even if we waived the condition c = c′, it is still non-trivial to
estimate ConFMR, which is by definition FMR, since the event we are
trying to check happens with probability only 2−112. According to
the rule of three [13], more than 3 · 2112 independent impostor bio-
metrics (i.e., pairs of x, x′ from different users such that x′ ∈ AR(x))
are required in the dataset S to conclude that FMR is smaller than
2−112 with 95% confidence. However, collecting such S is highly im-
practical.13 This is in sharp contrast to FNMR where we only needed
to assume that the dataset S contains more than 3·(1/5%) ≈ 3·24.32
pairs of biometrics x, x′ from the same user such that x′ ∈ AR(x) to
get a meaningful estimate. We note that estimating FMR, let alone
ConFMR, is generally a difficult problem in biometrics due to the
difficulty in collecting sufficient data, e.g., [5, 6].
Our approach. We divide the problem of estimating ConFMR into
two subproblems as follows:
(1) First, evaluate (cid:103)FMR. Namely, ignore the condition c = c′
on the sketch in ConFMR and simply estimate FMR, where
FMR := Pr[x, x′ ← X : x′ ∈ AR(x)].
(2) Then, show that FMR and the value of sketch are uncorrelated.
Namely, experimentally show that ConFMR can be approxi-
mated by FMR.
By individually solving the two subproblems, we eventually esti-
mate the valueConFMR by(cid:103)FMR. The details of the solution to the
individual subproblems follow.
Subproblem item 1. As mentioned before, the value FMR is typi-
cally too small to perform a simple estimation as we did for FNMR.
To overcome this issue, we borrow techniques from extreme value
analysis (EVA), a statistical method for evaluating very rare events
by using only an “extreme” subset of the dataset S [4, 30].
We explain how to estimate FMR using EVA below. First, define
a continuous function called scaled acceptance region sAR(w, x)
defined for all x ∈ X and w > 0 such that sAR(1, x) := AR(x)
and sAR(w, x) is an isotropic scaling of the original set AR(x) by
a factor w. A pictorial example is provided in Fig. 10. Notice that
although sAR(1, x) does not include many points from the dataset
¯S, we can increase them by enlarging w and considering a larger
set sAR(w, x). Also, define the scaled false matching rate function
sFMR(w) := Pr[x, x′ ← X : x′ ∈ sAR(w, x)], where we have
sFMR(1) := FMR by definition. In the following, we estimate the
probability distribution sFMR (w), denoted assFMR(w), and then in-
directly estimate the desired(cid:103)FMR by plugging in w = 1 intosFMR(w).
Note that this is different from how we were able to directly estimate
FNMR through the dataset S.
Figure 10: The bold gray area sAR(1, x)
is the original set AR(x). The triangles are
the fuzzy biometrics in ¯S that are different
from x. The shaded area sAR(w , x) is the
set AR(x) scaled by a factor w.

The core of EVA is how to estimate a probability distribution
sFMR(w) in the extremely rare setting w ≈ 1. The high level idea
is as follows. We first hypothesize that sFMR(w) can be explained
by a particular class of natural probability density function when
w is smaller than some appropriately chosen w∗. For instance, in
our case, the class we consider is the family of power distributions
Fpow = { awb }a,b >0.14 So as not to interrupt the explanation of
EVA, we provide rational behind the choice in Rem. 1. Now, since
awbdw for some unknown values of a and b,
sFMR(w∗) = ∫ w∗
we first estimatesFMR(w∗) from the dataset S, and then further
Finally, once a and b are computed via the MLA, we obtainsFMR(1)
by computing∫ 1
estimate a and b via the maximal likelihood analysis (MLA) [2].
Here, notice we can properly estimate sFMR(w∗) from the dataset S
for an appropriate value of w∗ since enough points in the dataset S
will lie in the region sAR(w∗, x) for large enough w∗ (see Fig. 10).
0 awbdw. Note that the main idea behind EVA is to
only use an appropriately chosen small w∗ so that we can focus on
estimating the range where sFMR(w) has extremely small values,
rather than estimating the entire function sFMR(w). Specifically, if
we use a too large w∗, we may be able to estimate sFMR(w) well
in its entirety, however, it will not produce good estimates when
conditioning on sFMR(w) with small values. The appropriate choice
of w∗ is dataset dependent and we discuss this in Rem. 1.
We now provide a more formal description of the above proce-
dure. First, consider the function k(w) defined as
(i) | x ∈ sAR(w, x
k(w) = 
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){ x ∈ ¯S\ ¯S

Since the dataset S is discrete, we can efficiently compute a sequence
of positive reals w1 < w2 < · · · , where each wn is the smallest w
satisfying k(wn) = n. We then pick an appropriate w∗ ∈ { wn }n as
explained in Rem. 1, and denote k∗ := k(w∗), that is, w∗ = wk∗. Also
set kmax = limw→∞ k(w), where by definition kmax is the number
by k∗/kmax. Then, by the hypothesis that the probability density
function sFMR(w) for small w ≤ w∗ follows f (w) = awb for some
positive reals a and b, we have

13Looking ahead, in our experiment, we consider settings where we only need to show
2−28 since we use 4 independent biometrics. However, this is still difficult to collect in
practice.
14Note that the class Fpow is not itself a probability density function. We only assume
that the probability density function of sFMR(w) for the narrow range w ∈ [0, w∗]
can be explained by Fpow.

Remark 1 (Choice of w∗ and Fpow). When using EVA, the par-
ticular choice of w∗ is data specific, and we typically check whether the
choice was reasonable by plotting the estimated function (see Sec. 7.1
for a concrete example). Noticing that w∗ and k∗ are in one-to-one re-
lation, we can choose k∗ instead. The concrete choice of k∗ may be data
