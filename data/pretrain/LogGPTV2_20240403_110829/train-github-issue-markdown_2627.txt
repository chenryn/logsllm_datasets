**Current behavior**
(ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" do not trigger when used with `[form]` directives.
                           Add 
**Expected/desired behavior**  
It would be nice to have native support for (ngSubmit) for `[form]` directives
also like `` elements have currently.
  * **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I've `paritculars` ControlArray which contains `ControlGroup` with fields
item, unit, quantity... .  
I was building an interface where user will enter some values and upon
submitting the from it will be instantly displyed in tabular view above the
form. Something like grid but not actually grid. Thats the use case.
