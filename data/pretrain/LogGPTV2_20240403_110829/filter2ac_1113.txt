**ATT&CK ID:** T1587  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Develop Capabilities

Adversaries may develop their own capabilities in-house to support various stages of their operations, rather than purchasing, freely downloading, or stealing them. This process involves identifying specific development requirements and creating tailored solutions, such as malware, exploits, and self-signed certificates. By developing these capabilities internally, adversaries can ensure that the tools they use are customized to their needs and are less likely to be detected by standard security measures. These in-house capabilities can be employed throughout multiple phases of the adversary lifecycle, providing a more flexible and effective approach to their malicious activities.
