the client is not already connected, the user can create a dial-up connection to an ISP before initiating 
the L2TP/IPsec connection. 
SSTP-based connections are established with the following process: 
1. The SSTP client establishes a TCP connection with the SSTP server between a dynamically-
allocated TCP port on the client and TCP port 443 on the server.  
2. The SSTP client sends an SSL Client-Hello message, indicating that the client wants to create an 
SSL session with the SSTP server.  
3. The SSTP server sends its computer certificate to the SSTP client.  
4. The SSTP client validates the computer certificate, determines the encryption method for the SSL 
session, generates an SSL session key and then encrypts it with the public key of the SSTP server’s 
certificate.  
5. The SSTP client sends the encrypted form of the SSL session key to the SSTP server.  
6. The SSTP server decrypts the encrypted SSL session key with the private key of its computer 
certificate. All future communication between the SSTP client and the SSTP server is encrypted with 
the negotiated encryption method and SSL session key.  
7. The SSTP client sends an HTTP over SSL request message to the SSTP server.  
8. The SSTP client negotiates an SSTP tunnel with the SSTP server.

Step 2: PPP Connection Setup 
The PPP connection process follows the four phases described in the "Point-to-Point Protocol" section 
of this chapter. 
Step 3: Remote Access VPN Client Registration 
Each remote access VPN client sends a DHCPInform message to obtain additional TCP/IP 
configuration parameters and performs name registration. 
To obtain additional TCP/IP configuration parameters, the client performs the following process: 
1. The client sends a DHCPInform message on the PPP link to the VPN server. 
2. The VPN server, configured with the DHCP Relay Agent routing protocol component and at least one 
IPv4 address of a DHCP server, relays the DHCPInform message to the DHCP server. 
3. The DHCP server sends back a DHCPAck message that contains the requested options. 
4. The VPN server relays the DHCPAck message to the client. 
The principal use of the DHCPInform message is to obtain TCP/IP configuration parameters that are 
not obtained using IPCP, such as the DNS domain name assigned to the VPN connection. Only remote 
access VPN clients running Windows send the DHCPInform message. 
Before nodes on the intranet can resolve the names of remote access VPN clients while they are 
connected, the names and IPv4 addresses of the clients must be registered in the DNS and network 
basic input/output system (NetBIOS) namespaces of the private network. Because a remote access 
VPN client is typically assigned a different IPv4 address every time it connects, names in the 
namespaces should be dynamic, rather than static. Dynamic name registration for remote access 
clients consists of the following: 
The remote access VPN client sends DNS dynamic update messages to its configured DNS server to 
register its DNS names. 
The client also sends NetBIOS name registration messages to its configured WINS server to register its 
NetBIOS names.

Site-to-Site VPN Connections 
Routing and Remote Access in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 supports demand-dial 
routing (also known as dial-on-demand routing) over both dial-up connections (such as analog phone 
lines or ISDN) and VPN connections. Demand-dial routing forwards packets across a PPP link, which is 
represented inside Routing and Remote Access as a demand-dial interface. You can use demand-dial 
interfaces to create on-demand connections across dial-up, non-permanent, or permanent media. 
Demand-dial routing is not the same as remote access. Remote access connects a single computer to 
a network, whereas demand-dial routing connects entire networks. However, both use PPP as the 
protocol through which they negotiate and authenticate the connection and encapsulate the data sent 
over it. With Routing and Remote Access in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003, you can 
enable remote access and demand-dial connections separately. However, they share the following 
attributes: 
Dial-in properties of user accounts 
Security (authentication protocols and encryption) 
Windows or RADIUS authentication, authorization, and accounting 
IPv4 address assignment and configuration 
PPP features, such as MPPC and MPPE 
Although the concept of demand-dial routing is fairly simple, the actual configuration is relatively 
complex due to the following factors: 
Connection endpoint addressing  
The connection must be made over public data networks, such as the analog phone system or the 
Internet. You specify the endpoint of the connection using a phone number for dial-up connections 
and either a host name or an IPv4 address for VPN connections. 
Authentication and authorization of the caller  
Anyone who calls the router must be authenticated and authorized. Authentication is based on the 
caller's set of credentials, which are passed to the router while the connection is being established. 
The credentials that are passed must correspond to a Windows user account. The router authorizes 
the connection based on the dial-in properties of the Windows user account and the remote access 
policies for the organization network. 
Differentiation between remote access VPN clients and calling routers  
Both routing and remote access capabilities coexist on the same computer running Windows 
Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003. Both remote access clients and demand-dial routers can 
initiate a connection. For demand-dial connections, the computer initiating the demand-dial 
connection is the calling router. The computer answering the connection attempt of a calling router 
is the answering router. The computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 
must be able to distinguish between a connection attempt from a remote access client and one 
from a calling router.  
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 421 
The computer identifies the connection attempt as a remote access connection unless the 
authentication credentials include a user name that matches the name of a demand-dial interface 
on the answering router. 
Configuration of both ends of the connection  
You must configure both ends of the connection to enable two-way communication, even if only one 
end of the connection always initiates a demand-dial connection. If you configure only one end of 
the connection, packets will route in only one direction. 
Configuration of static routes  
You should not use dynamic routing protocols over on-demand demand-dial connections. 
Therefore, you must add routes for address prefixes that are available across the demand-dial 
interface as static routes to the routing tables of the demand-dial routers. 
Configuring a Site-to-Site VPN Connection 
To configure a site-to-site VPN connection, you must do the following: 
Enable and configure Routing and Remote Access on the answering router. 
Use the same procedure as described in the "VPN Server Support" section of this chapter. 
Configure a demand-dial interface on the answering router. 
Enable and configure Routing and Remote Access on the calling router. 
Use the same procedure as described in the "VPN Server Support" section of this chapter. 
Configure a demand-dial interface on the calling router. 
Configuring a Demand-dial Interface 
From either the answering router or the calling router, perform the following steps: 
1. In the console tree of the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, right-click Network Interfaces, and 
then click New Demand-dial Interface. 
2. On the Welcome to the Demand-Dial Interface Wizard page, click Next. 
3. On the Interface Name page, type a name for the demand-dial interface, and then click Next. 
4. On the Connection Type page, click Connect using Virtual Private Networking (VPN), and then 
click Next. 
5. On the VPN Type page, click Automatic selection, Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), or 
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) (as needed), and then click Next. 
6. On the Destination Address page, type the IPv4 address of the other router's Internet interface, and 
then click Next. 
7. On the Protocols And Security page, select the Route IP packets on this interface and Add a 
user account so that a remote router can dial in check boxes, and then click Next. 
8. On the Static Routes for Remote Networks page, click Add to add static routes that are assigned 
to the demand-dial interface and that represent the address prefixes of the site across the site-to-site 
VPN connection (as needed). Click Next. 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 422 
9. On the Dial In Credentials page, type the password of the user account used by the calling router in 
Password and Confirm password, and then click Next. 
This step automatically creates a user account with the same name as the demand-dial interface that 
you are creating. You are also configuring the router to use this account name in its dial in 
credentials. When a calling router initiates a connection to an answering router, the calling router is 
using a user account name that matches the name of a demand-dial interface. Therefore, the 
answering router can determine that the incoming connection from the calling router is a demand-dial 
connection, rather than a remote access connection. 
10. On the Dial Out Credentials page, type the user name in User name, the user account domain 
name in Domain, and the user account password in both Password and Confirm password. 
If this router might call the other router, for a two-way-initiated, router-to-router VPN connection, 
configure the name, domain, and password when this router is acting as the calling router. If this 
router never calls the other router, you can type any name in User name and skip the rest of the 
fields. 
11. On the Completing the Demand-Dial Interface Wizard page, click Finish. 
Connection Example for a Site-to-Site VPN 
The complete configuration required for a site-to-site VPN connection is best illustrated by example. 
Figure 14-8 shows an example configuration of two offices that must connect to each other's networks 
across the Internet by using a site-to-site VPN connection. 
Figure 14-8  Example configuration for connecting two offices across the Internet 
The Seattle office has a computer that is running Windows Server 2008 and that acts as both a remote 
access VPN server and a demand-dial router. All computers in the Seattle office are connected to the 
172.16.1.0/24 network (subnet mask 255.255.255.0). The Seattle router (Router 1) has an Internet 
interface that is assigned the public IPv4 address 131.107.21.178.  
The New York office has a computer that is running Windows Server 2008 and that acts as both a 
remote access VPN server and a demand-dial router. All computers in the New York office are 
connected to the 172.16.2.0/24 network (subnet mask 255.255.255.0). The New York router (Router 2) 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 423 
has an Internet interface that is assigned the public IPv4 address 157.60.234.17. All computers in both 
offices are in the example.com domain. 
To configure demand-dial routing for the site-to-site VPN connection for this example, you must perform 
the following steps: 
Configure and enable Routing and Remote Access on Router 1. 
Configure a demand-dial interface on Router 1 with the following settings: 
Name: DD_NewYork 
Destination Address: 157.60.234.17 
Routes: 172.16.2.0 with the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 
Dial In Credentials: User account name of DD_NewYork with the password of 
h8#dW@93z~[Fc6$Q (example password) 
Dial Out Credentials: User account name of DD_Seattle, domain name of example.com, and the 
password of 7%uQv45l?p!kWy9* (example password) 
Configure and enable Routing and Remote Access on Router 2. 
Configure a demand-dial interface on Router 2. 
Name: DD_Seattle 
Destination Address: 131.107.21.178 
Routes: 172.16.1.0/24 
Dial In Credentials: User account name of DD_Seattle with the password 7%uQv45l?p!kWy9* 
Dial Out Credentials: User account name of DD_NewYork, domain name of example.com, and the 
password of h8#dW@93z~[Fc6$Q 
Because you have configured a two-way initiated site-to-site VPN connection, you can initiate the 
connection by performing the following steps on either Router 1 or Router 2: 
1. In the tree of Routing and Remote Access, click Routing Interfaces. 
2. In the details pane, right-click the demand-dial interface, and then click Connect. 
Figure 14-9 shows the resulting demand-dial routing configuration in terms of the demand-dial 
interfaces, static routes, and user accounts for the Seattle and New York offices.

Figure 14-9  Resulting example configuration for a site-to-site VPN connection 
This example shows a correct configuration for demand-dial routing. The user name from the user 
credentials of the demand-dial interface on the calling router must match the name of a demand-dial 
interface on the answering router in order for the incoming connection attempt to be considered a 
demand-dial connection. This relationship is summarized in Table 14-1.

The Connection Process for Site-to-Site VPNs  
A site-to-site VPN connection uses the same connection process as a remote access connection, as 
described in "The Process for Setting Up a Remote Access VPN Connection" section of this chapter, 
with the following exceptions: 
Both routers request an IPv4 address from the other router.  
The calling router does not register itself as a remote access client.

Using RADIUS for Network Access Authentication 
You can configure a VPN server running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 to perform its 
own authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for VPN connections or to use Remote 
Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS). RFCs 2865 and 2866 define RADIUS, a widely deployed 
protocol that enables centralized AAA for network access. 
Originally developed for dial-up remote access, RADIUS is now supported by VPN servers, wireless 
access points (APs), authenticating Ethernet switches, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) access servers, 
and other types of network access servers.  
RADIUS Components 
A RADIUS AAA infrastructure consists of the following components: 
Access clients  
Access servers (RADIUS clients)  
RADIUS servers  
User account databases  
RADIUS proxies  
Figure 14-10 shows these components. 
Figure 14-10  The components of a RADIUS infrastructure 
The following sections describe these components in detail. 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

Access Clients 
An access client requires access to a network or to another part of the network. Examples of access 
clients are dial-up or VPN remote access clients, wireless clients, or LAN clients connected to an 
authenticating switch. Access clients do not use the RADIUS protocol. 
Access Servers 
An access server provides access to a network. An access server using a RADIUS infrastructure is also 
a RADIUS client, sending connection requests and accounting messages to a RADIUS server. 
Examples of access servers are the following: 
Network access servers (remote access servers) that provide remote access to an organization 
network or to the Internet. An example is a computer that is running Windows Server 2008 or Windows 
Server 2003 and Routing and Remote Access and that provides either dial-up or VPN-based remote 
access to an organization's intranet.  
Wireless APs that provide physical access to an organization's network by using wireless-based 
transmission and reception technologies.  
Switches that provide physical access to an organization's network by using LAN technologies such as 
Ethernet.  
RADIUS Servers 
A RADIUS server receives and processes connection requests or accounting messages sent by 
RADIUS clients or RADIUS proxies. During a connection request, the RADIUS server processes the list
