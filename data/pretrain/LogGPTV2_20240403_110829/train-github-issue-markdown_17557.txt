### Bug report
**Bug summary**
Code that used to work flawlessly for replacing tick locations and labels on a
log axis now seems to merely add to the default labels, so both now appear in
the plot.
**Code for reproduction**
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    # set the axis limits
    xmin = -100   # min temperature to plot
    xmax = 40    # max temperature
    ymin = 100   # min pressure
    ymax = 1000  # max pressure
    plt.axis([xmin, xmax, ymax, ymin])
    plt.semilogy()
    # make lists of tick values and tick labels
    plist = range(ymin,ymax,100)
    plabels = []
    for p in plist:
        plabels.append(str(p))
    plt.yticks(plist,plabels)
    x = [xmin, xmax]
    y = [ymin, ymax]
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.show()
**Actual outcome**

**Expected outcome**
There should be no overwriting of custom labels with the default scientific
notation labels. It did work correctly about a year ago, but I cannot say what
version of Matplotlib was being used at that time.
