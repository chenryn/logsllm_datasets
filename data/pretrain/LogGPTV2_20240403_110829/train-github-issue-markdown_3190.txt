I have referenced the create-react-app sample and added additional pages. However, each time I click on a router link, the following warning is thrown:

> Warning: Material-UI: You can only instantiate one class name generator on the client side. If you do otherwise, you take the risk of having conflicting class names in production.

### Expected Behavior
The above warning should not appear.

### Current Behavior
Every time a route link is clicked, the warning is displayed.
