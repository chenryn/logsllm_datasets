Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses. Some network devices are designed with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the device's functionality are encapsulated within a single file. Adversaries can alter this file either in storage, to be loaded during a future boot, or in memory during runtime. This technique allows them to persistently modify the device's behavior or compromise its security.
