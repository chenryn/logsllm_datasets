User: I'm used to ending the python interactive interpreter using Ctrl-d using Linux and OS X.  On windows though, you have to use CTRL+Z and then enter.  Is there any way to use CTRL+D?
Assistant: You can change the key set that Idle should be using.  

Under Options->"Configure IDLE..."
go to the "Keys" tab.  
On the right you can select the
    "IDLE Classic Unix" key set.
