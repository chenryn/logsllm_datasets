User: I would like to write some Python code in Windows using QtPy. But before I do that I'd like to know that I can use the code I wrote in Python. I understand that the complied program won't work due to different platforms but will there be any issues with regards to the *.py files I write in windows vs linux?
I've been trying to install QtPy on my Mint installation and I just don't know what the problem is. Which is why I wanna go this route.
I'd also like my code to work on the raspberry pi.
Could you guys advise me to this end?
Thanks!
Assistant: Mostly, yes, as long as you keep to using the tools Python provides you and don't write code that is platform specific.
Use os.path.join() to build paths, for example. Open files in binary mode when you deal with binary data, text mode when it's text data. Etc.
Python code itself is platform agnostic; the interpreter on Linux can read python code written on Windows just fine and vice versa.
The general rule of thumb is to pay attention to the documentation of the modules you are using; any platform specific gotchas should be documented.
