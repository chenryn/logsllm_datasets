I am in the process of setting up a multi-node Kubernetes (k8s) cluster using Docker. I encountered an issue while attempting to mount a volume, specifically a secret. Initially, I received the following error:

```
Unable to mount volumes for pod "service-registry-eccye_default": exit status 32
```

Yesterday, @cjcullen on Slack suggested that I should run the kubelet with the `--containerized` flag. After adding this flag and restarting the server, I now encounter a different error:

```
Unable to mount volumes for pod "service-registry-4b682_default": fork/exec /nsenter: no such file or directory
```

It appears that this issue has been reported before (see #8734), but it was never resolved.
