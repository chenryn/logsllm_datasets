I'm setting up a docker-multinode k8s. I'm trying to mount a volume (in this
case, a secret). Originally, I was getting this issue:  
`Unable to mount volumes for pod "service-registry-eccye_default": exit status
32`  
I was on Slack yesterday, and @cjcullen pointed out that I should be running
the kubelet with the `--containerized` flag. I have added it and restarted the
server and now I'm having this error:  
`Unable to mount volumes for pod "service-registry-4b682_default": fork/exec
/nsenter: no such file or directory`
It looks like this issue was brought up in the past (#8734), but never
resolved.
