in Algorithm 1, the application sends a heartbeat mes-
sage to the watchdog process. As long as the heartbeat
message is received, the watchdog process signals the
watchdog relay, and resets its internal timer.
If the
timer in the watchdog process is not reset before it
expires, it is assumed that a failure or corruption of
the IRIS application has caused it to miss resetting its
watchdog. The watchdog relay in Fig. 3 is opened and
the operator alerted to the fault.
Independent of the watchdog relay, the IRIS appli-
cation also controls two functional relays. At the end of
each imaging loop, the application signals both relays
to open or close, depending on the position of the tu-
mor. In addition, each of the three relays has a built-in
timeout circuit, as shown in Fig. 3. To remain oper-
ational, the relays are required to receive an open or
close signal within a predetermined timeout period. If
no signal is sent within the timeout period, the relay
is opened automatically, and the circuit must be reset
before operation can continue.
The relay conﬁguration shown in Fig. 3 is conser-
vative by nature. Since the functional relay circuit
and timers are supplied as third-party components,
we assume that their failure modes cannot be deter-
mined with the utmost conﬁdence by simply using the
schematic and speciﬁcation documents made available
to us. Therefore, we decided to add additional relays
including one controlled by the watchdog process. The
triple-redundant conﬁguration in Fig. 3 can tolerate
two relay failures where they are stuck in the closed
position, or two timer failures.

Data and Result Checking. The fault coverage
achieved by the watchdog process and the timers is
limited since critical results of the application software
are not checked. In fact, the application may be only
partially failed and produce errors, and yet be able
to reset its timer. To improve the fault coverage, we
continuously monitor aspects of application behavior
crucial to treatment quality. Such online monitoring is
a general technique to detect hazardous system condi-
tions via run-time analysis of previously speciﬁed safety
constraints [3]
A critical failure in the IRIS application is one where
the pattern recognition software fails to locate the
marker when the signal quality is poor, or when back-
ground clutter mimics the target. Therefore, we antic-
ipate the possibility that tracking will fail, and include
an online monitoring system to automatically detect
and respond to such failures.
We monitor for two classes of tracking failures—
recoverable and unrecoverable. A recoverable failure
is a transient or intermittent loss of tracking for which
automatic recovery is expected. In the case of an un-
recoverable failure where tracking quality continues to
degrade, the tracking software must be manually re-
initialized. The purpose of having these two failure
classes is to improve treatment eﬃciency while main-
taining safety. When a recoverable failure occurs, the
treatment is temporarily halted by the linac beam
hold oﬀ mechanism. Treatment resumes automatically
when the tracking is deemed satisfactory. By contrast,
when an unrecoverable failure occurs, a tracking inter-
lock is enabled and the treatment beam permanently
halted. The tracking failure must be cleared by the
operator to resume treatment.
Several indicators can be used to detect the occur-
rence of a tracking failure. The ﬁrst indicator we con-
sider is the pattern recognition score (PRS). The PRS
is a measure of the certainty with which the tracking
software could ﬁnd the target within a single image.
For the IRIS system it is the highest correlation of the
template within an image sub-window. Since the pixel
with the highest PRS is assumed to be the location of
the target, the score gives us a measure of the quality
of the match. When doing stereo tracking, the corre-
lation score is computed for both images, but we need
only consider the image with the lower score. This sim-
pliﬁcation is justiﬁed because 3D accuracy is generally
limited by the imager which is tracking more poorly.
The second indicator we consider is the distance be-
tween rays (DBR). The DBR is a measure of consis-
tency of tracking between the two imagers. Once the
image location of the marker has been determined, the
marker is known to lie on a corresponding ray in 3D

space. Therefore, when the location is known in both
images, the three dimensional position of the marker
is reconstructed by intersecting two corresponding 3D
rays. Usually the two rays do not intersect exactly;
instead there is gap. The DBR refers to this gap be-
tween the rays, and it is small when the marker is being
tracked properly in both images, but may become large
when one or both imager has identiﬁed the wrong loca-
tion for the marker. Thus, a large DBR is an indication
of poor tracking.
The last indicators we consider are the instantaneous
velocity (IV) and the instantaneous acceleration (IA).
The IV and IA are measures of tracking stability over
a short period of time. Poor localization of the target
within an image often causes sudden jumps in the com-
puted target location whereas we expect the motion of
the markers to vary smoothly during good tracking.
The velocity and acceleration at time k can be com-
puted as:
v(k) = |x(k) − x(k − 1)|
a(k) = |x(k) − 2x(k − 1) + x(k − 2)|.

where x(k) is the position of the marker. Both v(k) and
a(k) are compared against a priori deﬁned threshold
values to detect a tracking failure.
Fig. 4 shows an example of how a tracking error is
detected. This ﬁgure was generated by executing the
cylindrical marker tracking algorithm retrospectively
on a pre-recorded clinical ﬂuoroscopy image sequence.
The tracking failure is caused by a low signal to noise
ratio of the images themselves. We did not inject arti-
ﬁcial faults in the tracking algorithm.
At each frame, the position of the marker is shown
with respect to the PRS and IV indicators described
above. It can be seen that the position of the marker
follows the rhythmic pattern of human respiration for

a while, but becomes irregular after six breathing pe-
riods. This irregularity is caused by the pattern recog-
nition software no longer tracking the marker accu-
rately. As a result, the PRS falls and the IV value
increases. During a tracking failure, the IV does not
reﬂect the motion of the tumor, but rather the insta-
bility of the pattern recognition software when a target
is not nearby.
Once a tracking failure is detected, it must be clas-
siﬁed as a recoverable failure or not. The following
simple techniques can be used for this classiﬁcation.
(cid:127) An error counter is incremented after each viola-
tion of the IV or IA threshold, and once the error
count reaches a speciﬁed value, the tracking failure
is considered unrecoverable.
(cid:127) Two threshold values, one high and one low, are
associated with each IV and IA measure.
If a
tracking error trips the low threshold value but not
the higher one, the failure is termed recoverable.
If, however, the high threshold value is exceeded,
the tracking failure is termed unrecoverable.
The appropriate values for the above thresholds have
not been decided yet, and is a matter for future re-
search.
Operator Interaction. Anecdotal evidence sug-
gests that it takes an observant, trained operator be-
tween 2 and 10 seconds to respond to a tracking er-
ror. Online monitoring of tracking quality improves
the response rate to errors signiﬁcantly, and can often
detect a failure within one or two images. However,
not all tracking failures can be detected automatically.
Early studies suggest that about 65 % of the tracking
failures can be automatically detected within 1.5 sec-
onds [4]. Therefore, safety is enhanced by using both
online monitoring and operator intervention to detect
and recover from tracking failures.

An overview of the complete procedure is shown in
ﬁgure 5. First, the operator initiates tracking in the
software. As tracking proceeds, the online monitor
tries to detect tracking failures automatically.
If the
error is judged to be a recoverable error, the software
does not treat the patient for this image frame. If the
error is judged to be unrecoverable, the software inter-
locks the system and waits for the operator to clear
the error.
In addition, the operator has the option
to engage a manual interlock at any time during the
treatment.
Thus, in the current implementation of IRIS, pa-
tient treatment is performed under both automatic and
manual monitoring with a human in the loop.
4 Summary
We have described design techniques aimed at en-
suring the safe operation of IRIS, a respiratory-gated
imaging and radiation therapy system. The safety fea-
tures include watchdog processes and timers to detect
control-ﬂow failures aﬀecting the application and an
online monitoring scheme to detect and classify track-
ing failures. We discussed several simple indicators to
detect the occurrence of tracking failures. The current
implementation of IRIS allows for operator interven-
tion along with automated online monitoring to detect
and recover from tracking failures.
