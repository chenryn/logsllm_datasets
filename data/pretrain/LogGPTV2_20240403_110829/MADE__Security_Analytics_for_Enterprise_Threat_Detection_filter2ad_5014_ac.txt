### Analysis and Observations

1. **Parameter Values**
   - Malicious domains have, on average, twice as many parameter values as legitimate ones.

2. **Domain URLs**
   - 16.15% of all URLs to malicious domains are domain URLs, compared to only 3.79% for legitimate domains.

3. **User-Agent (UA) String Features**
   - **Distinct UAs**: Count the distinct UAs seen under a given domain and statistics per host.
   - **Empty UAs**: Fraction of HTTP requests with empty UA.
   - **Popularity of UAs**: Build a history of UAs observed over a month-long period and consider a UA as popular if it has been used by at least 10 hosts.
   - **Unpopular UAs**: 15.2% of malicious domains and only 1.5% of legitimate domains are contacted solely through unpopular UAs.
   - **OS and Browser**: Windows XP is 5 times more vulnerable than other OSes, and IE is twice as vulnerable as other browsers.

4. **Result Code Features**
   - **Failed Connections**: Malicious domains tend to have more failed connections (4xx/5xx) due to their short lifetimes and quick takedown by hosting providers/registrars.
   - **Enterprise Proxies**: Tend to block access to unknown domains, resulting in a high number of failed connections (code 404).

5. **Web Referer Features**
   - **Empty Referers**: 24.5% of malicious domains were visited without referer, compared to only 4.3% for other domains.
   - **Referer Domains**: A large number of referer domains or a high ratio of referer domains to hosts suggest that the domain might be exploited by malware or used as a central point to coordinate compromised sites.

6. **Content-Type Features**
   - **Content Types**: Legitimate domains have about twice as many content types as malicious ones.
   - **Empty Content Types**: 41.35% of malicious domains and only 8.98% of legitimate domains have empty content types.

### Conclusion

The features listed above provide a comprehensive set of metrics for detecting malicious domains. These features can be used to build robust machine learning models for enterprise threat detection. The analysis confirms that malicious domains exhibit distinct patterns in terms of user-agent strings, result codes, referers, and content types, which can be leveraged for effective detection.
