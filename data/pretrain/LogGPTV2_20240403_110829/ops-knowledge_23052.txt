User: Several processes with the same name are running on host. What is the cross-platform way to get PIDs of those processes by name using python or jython?

I want something like pidof but in python. (I don't have pidof anyway.)
I can't parse /proc because it might be unavailable (on HP-UX).
I do not want to run os.popen('ps') and parse the output because I think it is ugly (field sequence may be different in different OS).
Target platforms are Solaris, HP-UX, and maybe others.
Assistant: For jython, if Java 5 is used, then you can get the Java process id as following:
from java.lang.management import *
pid = ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName()
