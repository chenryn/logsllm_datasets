## Abstract:
In a broadcast encryption system, a broadcaster can encrypt a message to a group of authorized receivers, and each authorized receiver can use their private key to decrypt the ciphertext, while unauthorized users cannot. Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) is a variant where any string representing the user's identity (e.g., email address) can be used as their public key. IBBE has applications in pay-TV systems, distribution of copyrighted materials, and satellite radio communications. However, existing IBBE systems do not simultaneously ensure confidentiality and anonymity. In this paper, we propose a generic IBBE construction using an anonymous identity-based encryption (IBE) primitive with robust properties, which ensures both confidentiality and anonymity under chosen-ciphertext attacks. Our construction maintains constant public parameters size, private key size, and decryption cost, independent of the number of receivers.

## 1. Introduction

Broadcast encryption (BE), introduced by Fiat and Naor [16], allows a broadcaster to encrypt a message for a group of users, and only authorized users can decrypt it. BE is widely used in practice due to its efficiency in computational cost and communication load compared to traditional point-to-point encryption.

Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) [12, 28] is a type of public-key BE where each user's public key is a string representing their identity (e.g., email address). The private keys are generated by a private key generator (PKG) based on the identities. IBBE supports exponentially many potential receivers.

While confidentiality is a primary goal of encryption schemes, anonymity, which aims to hide the receiver's identity, is also important in many applications. Traditional IBBE schemes, however, do not provide anonymity because the receiver set \( S \) is transmitted as part of the ciphertext.

### 1.1 Our Contributions

We propose a generic IBBE scheme from a generic anonymous IBE construction, which is the first IBBE scheme to simultaneously provide confidentiality and anonymity against chosen-ciphertext attacks under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. Our scheme maintains constant public parameters size, private key size, and decryption cost, making it more efficient than existing IBBE schemes.

### 1.2 Related Work

Since the introduction of BE by Fiat and Naor [16], many BE schemes have been proposed, but they do not ensure the anonymity of receivers. Barth et al. [5] presented two anonymous BE constructions in the public key setting with chosen-ciphertext security. Fazio et al. [15] and Libert et al. [23] proposed outsider-anonymous BE constructions, but these are in the public key setting.

The first IBBE scheme with fixed-size ciphertext and private key was proposed by Delerablee [12]. Many IBBE schemes with different properties have since been proposed, but none of these schemes can provide both confidentiality and anonymity simultaneously. We address this gap in our work.

### 1.3 Bilinear Groups

Bilinear groups are the underlying algebraic structure for many IBBE schemes, including ours. A bilinear group is defined by a tuple \((p, G, G_T, e)\), where \(G\) and \(G_T\) are multiplicative cyclic groups of prime order \(p\), and \(e: G \times G \to G_T\) is a map with the following properties:

- **Bilinearity**: \(e(u^a, v^b) = e(u, v)^{ab}\) for all \(u, v \in G\) and \(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_p\).
- **Non-degeneracy**: \(e(g, g) \neq 1_{G_T}\), where \(g\) is a generator of \(G\).
- **Computability**: There exists an efficient algorithm to compute \(e(u, v)\) for all \(u, v \in G\).

### 1.4 Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Assumption

The Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) problem in a bilinear group \((p, G, G_T, e)\) is as follows: Given a tuple \((g, g^a, g^b, g^c, Z)\) for \(a, b, c \leftarrow_R \mathbb{Z}_p\), output 1 if \(Z = e(g, g)^{abc}\) and 0 otherwise. The DBDH assumption holds if all probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) algorithms have a negligible advantage in solving the DBDH problem.

## 2. Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption

An identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) scheme consists of four algorithms: Setup, Extract, Enc, and Dec.

- **Setup(1^\(\lambda\))**: On input of a security parameter \(\lambda\), it outputs the public parameters \(params\) and a master secret key \(msk\).
- **Extract(msk, ID)**: On input of a master secret key \(msk\) and an identity \(ID\), it outputs a private key \(sk_{ID}\) for the identity \(ID\).
- **Enc(params, S, M)**: On input of the public parameters \(params\), a receiver set \(S\), and a message \(M \in M\), it outputs a ciphertext \(CT\).
- **Dec(sk_{ID}, CT)**: On input of a private key \(sk_{ID}\) and a ciphertext \(CT\), it outputs either a message \(M\) or an error symbol \(\bot\).

The correctness property requires that, for all \(ID \in S\), if \((params, msk) \leftarrow \text{Setup}(1^\lambda)\), \(sk_{ID} \leftarrow \text{Extract}(msk, ID)\), and \(CT \leftarrow \text{Enc}(params, S, M)\), then \(\text{Dec}(sk_{ID}, CT) = M\) with overwhelming probability.

### 2.1 Security Notions

We review the security notions for an IBBE scheme, including indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA), anonymity under chosen-ciphertext attacks (ANO-CCA), and weakly robust against chosen-ciphertext attacks (WROB-CCA).

#### 2.1.1 IND-CCA Game

- **Setup**: Challenger \(C\) runs \((params, msk) \leftarrow \text{Setup}(1^\lambda)\) and sends \(params\) to adversary \(A\), keeping \(msk\).
- **Phase 1**: Adversary \(A\) adaptively issues extraction and decryption queries.
- **Challenge**: Adversary \(A\) submits two distinct equal-length messages \(M_0, M_1 \in M\) and a receiver set \(S^*\). Challenger \(C\) flips a random coin \(\beta \in \{0, 1\}\) and returns the challenge ciphertext \(CT^* \leftarrow \text{Encrypt}(params, S^*, M_\beta)\).
- **Phase 2**: Adversary \(A\) continues to issue queries with restrictions.
- **Guess**: Adversary \(A\) outputs a guess \(\beta'\). The advantage is defined as \(\text{Adv}_{A, \text{IBBE}}^{\text{IND-CCA}} = |\Pr[\beta' = \beta] - 1/2|\).

#### 2.1.2 ANO-CCA Game

- **Setup**: Same as in the IND-CCA game.
- **Phase 1**: Same as in the IND-CCA game.
- **Challenge**: Adversary \(A\) submits a message \(M^*\) and two distinct sets \(S_0, S_1\) with \(|S_0| = |S_1|\). Challenger \(C\) flips a random coin \(\beta \in \{0, 1\}\) and returns the challenge ciphertext \(CT^* \leftarrow \text{Encrypt}(params, S_\beta, M^*)\).
- **Phase 2**: Adversary \(A\) continues to issue queries with restrictions.
- **Guess**: Adversary \(A\) outputs a guess \(\beta'\). The advantage is defined as \(\text{Adv}_{A, \text{IBBE}}^{\text{ANO-CCA}} = |\Pr[\beta' = \beta] - 1/2|\).

#### 2.1.3 WROB-CCA Game

- **Setup**: Same as in the IND-CCA game.
- **Query Phase**: Same as Phase 1 in the IND-CCA game.
- **Output**: Adversary \(A\) outputs a message \(M\), a receiver set \(S^* = \{ID_1, ID_2, \ldots, ID_t\}\), and a challenge ciphertext \(CT^* \leftarrow \text{Encrypt}(params, S^*, M)\). It is required that \(A\) has not issued an extraction query on \(ID^* \notin S^*\). Adversary \(A\) wins if \(\text{Dec}(sk_{ID^*}, CT^*) \neq \bot\).

We define the advantage as the probability that \(A\) wins. An IBBE scheme is WROB-CCA secure if for all PPT adversaries \(A\), the advantage is negligible.
