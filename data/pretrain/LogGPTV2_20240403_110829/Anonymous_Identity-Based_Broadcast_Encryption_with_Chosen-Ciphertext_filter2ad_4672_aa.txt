Abstract. In a broadcast encryption system, a broadcaster can encrypt
a message to a group of authorized receivers S and each authorized
receiver can use his/her own private key to correctly decrypt the broad-
cast ciphertext, while the users outside S cannot. Identity-based broad-
cast encryption (IBBE) system is a variant of broadcast encryption sys-
tem where any string representing the user’s identity (e.g., email address)
can be used as his/her public key. IBBE has found many applications
in real life, such as pay-TV systems, distribution of copyrighted materi-
als, satellite radio communications. When employing an IBBE system,
it is very important to protect the message’s conﬁdentiality and the
users’ anonymity. However, existing IBBE systems cannot satisfy conﬁ-
dentiality and anonymity simultaneously. In this paper, using an anony-
mous identity-based encryption (IBE) primitive with robust property as
a building block, we propose a generic IBBE construction, which can
simultaneously ensure the conﬁdentiality and anonymity under chosen-
ciphertext attacks. Our generic IBBE construction has a desirable prop-
erty that the public parameters size, the private key size and the decryp-
tion cost are constant and independent of the number of receivers.

Broadcast encryption (BE), introduced by Fiat and Naor [16], is one kind of one-

of users who are listening to a broadcast channel, and only the authorized users

can get the message. At present, BE causes a wide spread attention in theory
and practice. As BE can save most computational cost and communication load
relatively to repeatedly utilize point-to-point traditional encryption.
Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) [12,28]
is a special kind of
public-key BE, in which the public key of each user can be any string just repre-
senting the user’s identity (e.g., email address) and the private keys of users are
generated by a private key generator (PKG) according to their identities. It is
the same as in the identity-based encryption [8]. There exists a desired property
is that IBBE can support exponentially many users as potential receivers.
While an encryption scheme aims to protect the message’s conﬁdential-
ity, another security requirement, namely, anonymity, which aims to hide the
receiver’s identity and it is a desirable security property in many application
scenarios. Anonymity comes from the key privacy concept, which was ﬁrst intro-
duced by Bellare et al. [6]. It captures the property that an eavesdropper cannot
tell which public key the ciphertext is created under. However, the receiver set
S in the traditional IBBE scheme is transmitted as a part of the ciphertext.
Obviously, it cannot hide the receivers’ identities. Therefore, traditional IBBE
schemes are unable to obtain the anonymity requirement.
1.1 Our Contributions
In this paper, we propose a generic identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE)
scheme from a generic anonymous IBE construction, which is the ﬁrst IBBE
scheme simultaneously provide conﬁdentiality and anonymity against chosen-
ciphertext attacks under Decisional Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman (DBDH) assump-
tion. In addition, the public parameters size, the private key size and the decryp-
tion cost are constant and independent of the number of receivers is more eﬃcient
than the existing IBBE schemes.
1.2 Related Work
Since broadcast encryption (BE) was introduced by Fiat and Naor [16], many
BE schemes have been proposed, e.g., [9,12,13,17,28]. However, these schemes
cannot ensure the anonymity of receivers. To address this problem, in 2006,
Barth et al. [5] presented two anonymous BE constructions in the public key
setting with chosen-ciphertext security. Their ﬁrst construction is a generic BE
construction in the standard model, where the decryption cost is linear with the
number of receivers. As it need try to ﬁnd an appropriate ciphertext component
for decryption. Their second construction is an improved construction in which
only a constant number of cryptographic operations is required for decryption,
whereas the security proof relies on the random oracle model [7]. In PKC 2012,
Fazio et al. [15] proposed two outsider-anonymous broadcast encryption con-
structions with sub-linear ciphertexts, which are adaptive CPA and CCA secure
in the standard model, respectively. In the same year, Libert et al. [23] presented
Generic Anonymous Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption
209
several anonymous broadcast encryption constructions with adaptive CCA secu-
rity in the standard model and gave an united security deﬁnition for anonymous
BE scheme. However, all of these constructions are in the public key setting.
In 2007, the ﬁrst IBBE scheme with ﬁx-size ciphertext and private key was
proposed by Delerablee [12]. Specially, their scheme supports a ﬂexible number
of possible users. That is, the number of users are not determined in the system
setup phase. Since then, lots of IBBE schemes with diﬀerent properties have been
proposed, e.g., [19,21,24,25,28,30,31,33,34,37,40]. When identity-based encryp-
tion is incorporated to the multi-receiver setting, many multi-receiver identity-
based encryption schemes [3,4,10] have been proposed. However, among all of
these IBBE and multi-receiver identity-based encryption schemes, the receivers’
identities are transmitted as a part of the ciphertext. Obviously, these schemes
cannot provide anonymity.
Therefore, many anonymous identity-based broadcast encryption schemes,
e.g., [20,26,38] and anonymous multi-receiver identity-based encryption schemes,
e.g., [11,14,22,29,35,36,39] have been successively proposed. However, none of
these schemes can achieve conﬁdentiality and anonymity simultaneously against
chosen-ciphertext attacks. In this paper, we have solved this problem.
1.3 Bilinear Groups
We brieﬂy review the concept of bilinear groups which is the underlying algebraic
structure of many IBBE including ours.
We assume there is a probabilistic algorithm G which takes as input a security
parameter λ and outputs a tuple (p, G, GT , e), where G and GT are multiplicative
cyclic groups of prime order p (of bit-length λ), and e : G × G → GT is a map,
which has the following properties: Bilinearity: e(ua, vb) = e(u, v)ab for all
u, v ∈ G and ∀a, b ∈ Zp. Non-degeneracy: e(g, g) (cid:5)= 1G, where g is a generator
of G. Computability: There exists an eﬃcient algorithm to compute e(u, v) for
∀u, v ∈ G.
1.4 Decisional Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman Assumption
The decisional BDH (DBDH) problem in a bilinear group (p, G, GT , e) is
as follows: Given a tuple (g, ga, gb, gc, Z) for a, b, c ←R Zp as input, out-
put 1 if Z = e(g, g)abc and 0 otherwise. For a probabilistic algorithm
A, we deﬁne its advantage in solving the DBDH problem as AdvDBDHA
=
|Pr[A(g, ga, gb, gc, e(g, g)abc) = 1] − Pr[A(g, ga, gb, gc, Z) = 1]|, where g is a ran-
dom generator in G and Z ←R GT . We say that the DBDH assumption holds if
all probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) algorithms have a negligible advantage
in solving the DBDH problem.
2 Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption
We shall review the deﬁnition and security notions for identity-based broadcast
encryption [18] as follows.

K. He et al.
An identity-based broadcast encryption scheme, associated with message
space M, consists of a tuple of four algorithms (Setup, Extract, Enc, Dec):
Setup(1λ): On input of a security parameter λ, it outputs the public parameters
params and a master secret key msk.
Extract(msk, ID): On input of a master secret key msk and an identity ID, it
outputs a private key skID for the identity ID.
Enc(params, S, M): On input of the public parameters params, a receiver set
S and a message M ∈ M, it outputs a ciphertext CT .
Dec(skID, CT ): On input of a private key skID and a ciphertext CT , it outputs
either a message M or an error symbol ⊥.
The correctness property requires that, for all ID ∈ S, if (params, msk) ←
Setup (1λ), skID ← Extract (msk, ID) and CT ← Enc (params, S, M), then
Dec (skID, CT ) = M with overwhelming probability.
Remark. Identity-based encryption is a special case of identity-based broadcast
encryption, when the size of the receiver set is only one.
Next, we shall review the security notions for an IBBE scheme. First, we
review the model of indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-
CCA), which means that the ciphertext does not leak any information of the
message. Then, we review the model of anonymity under chosen-ciphertext
attacks (ANO-CCA), which means that the ciphertext does not leak any iden-
tity in the receiver set. Last, we review the model of weakly robust against
chosen-ciphertext attacks (WROB-CCA), which guarantees that the decryption
attempts to fail with high probability when the “wrong” private key is used.
Respectively, these security models are deﬁned by the following games between
a PPT adversary A and a challenger C.
The IND-CCA Game:
Setup: Challenger C runs (params, msk) ← Setup(1λ), and then sends the
public parameters params to adversary A and keeps the master secret key msk
itself.
Phase 1: Adversary A adaptively issues the following queries:
– Extraction Query: On input of an identity ID, challenger C returns skID ←
Extract(msk, ID) to adversary A.
– Decryption Query: On input of an identity ID and a ciphertext CT ,
challenger C returns m ←Dec(skID, CT ) to adversary A, where skID ←
Extract(msk, ID).
Challenge: Adversary A submits two distinct equal-length messages M0, M1
∗ to challenger C. It is required that A has not issued

Phase 2: Adversary A continues to adaptively issue queries as in Phase 1 subject
to the following restrictions: (i) A cannot issue Extraction Query on ID, where
ID ∈ S
∗.
Guess: Adversary A outputs a guess β

Setup: It is the same as in the IND-CCA Game.
Phase 1: It is the same as in the IND-CCA Game.
Challenge: Adversary A submits a message M

to challenger C. It is required that |S0| = |S1| and adversary A has not issued
Extraction Query on ID ∈ S0(cid:8)S1, where S0(cid:8)S1 denotes S0∪S1−S0∩S1. Then
challenger C ﬂips a random coin β ∈ {0, 1} and returns the challenge ciphertext

Phase 2: Adversary A continues to adaptively issue queries as in Phase 1 with
the restrictions as follows: (i) Adversary A cannot issue Extraction Query on
ID, where ID ∈ S0(cid:8)S1; (ii) Adversary A cannot issue Decryption Query on
(ID, C
Guess: Adversary A outputs a guess β
Deﬁnition 2. We deﬁne adversary A’s advantage in the above ANO-CCA Game

Remark. Note that the deﬁnition captures not only outsider attacks but also
insider attacks. In other words, even when an identity ID ∈ S0∩ S1 is corrupted,
the anonymity of any non-corrupted ID ∈ S0(cid:8)S1 is still preserved.
The WROB-CCA Game:
Setup: It is the same as in the IND-CCA Game.
