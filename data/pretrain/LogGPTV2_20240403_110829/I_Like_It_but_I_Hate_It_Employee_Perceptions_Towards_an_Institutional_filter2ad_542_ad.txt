Figure 2: Comparing Concerns about Impact on Personal
and Institutional Security in the Event of a Lost Device.
This finding appears intuitive. In the event of the loss (i.e., not
targeted theft) of a token, there is typically no discernable way
to identify the owner or perhaps even the organization that the
token belongs to (unless an individual places extra information on
the token itself, such as a name sticker, etc.), thus making it more
difficult to initiate a detrimental security incident. However, if a
personal phone is lost, personal security immediately becomes more
of a concern due to the often sensitive, and personal nature of an
individual’s data stored on or accessible via a cellphone. In contrast,
individuals are only moderately concerned about compromising
organizational security if a device of either kind is misplaced.
This is a somewhat interesting contrast, as if an attacker would
be able to gain access to a cellphone (beyond the lock screen), they
would be able to view information about which institutions or re-
sources any second-factor apps are attached to. Even further, if an
attacker would have access to the device during a ’DuoPush’ sce-
nario, they would be able to view a logo of the institution, along with
the user name attached to the account at that institution (hence the
redaction of information in Appendix A.3). This, perhaps, reveals a
lack of employee comprehension of possible security risks associ-
ated with the loss of a personal device on a university network, or
more generalizable, an institutional network.
We also queried the participants about any self-reported per-
ception and behavior changes in their phone usage after adopting
the DuoMobile system. Specifically, we asked them if they felt
any additional responsibility when using their personal devices to
keep the institution secure, and if they had changed any of their
phone security habits (such as using a passcode etc.) after adopting
DuoMobile. For the latter, only 3 of our participants reported any
form of phone security change after adopting DuoMobile. When
exploring any perceived added responsibility, 6% of our participants
reported a definite perceived increase in the burden of responsibil-
ity, 14.9% reported a slight increase, and 11.3% were unsure. The
remaining 67.7% reported feeling no more responsibility to keeping
their institution secure than before.
Note that the university did not enforce any additional security
policies on the phones of employees who installed the DuoMobile
app. Unlike many institutions which may enforce some form of
passcode requirements, device encryption, or more if an institu-
tional email or other institutional software is added to a mobile
phone [52], DuoMobile does not currently mandate any minimum
security settings for smartphones, at least at Penn State.
Finally, we asked to which degree participants believed that the
physical token and the DuoMobile application were contributing
to institutional security. Though there was some variation within
the responses, the mean comparisons were exactly even, indicating
that our participants felt, collectively, that the physical token and
DuoMobile contributed to the security of the institution equally.
5 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION
In this section, we complement our previous findings with qualita-
tive observations derived from open-ended parts of the survey. We
also add selected responses from the participants. Implications of
this study are discussed throughout.
5.1 2FA System Usability
Although there have been numerous user studies on token-based
2FA systems in the past, our study is the first to our knowledge to
conduct a usability study on the often-proposed 2FA authenticator
app in an institutional setting. As such, it is somewhat difficult
for us to compare our results to previous work, as the varying
factors between a token-based system and the DuoMobile app are
large. As we have now seen, the transition between a token-based
2FA system and a digital 2FA system (DuoMobile) presents many
different usability challenges. As such, previous studies describing
usability metrics concerning 2FA tokens may not be as applicable
as desired, partially due to fundamental differences in how token
systems operate compared to mobile phone-based 2FA apps.
In previous token-based systems, the institutions provided to-
kens for nearly all employees, and these were maintained by local
IT staff in the event of any issue. Due to their simplistic nature,
there were not many usability challenges tied to this original au-
thentication method. However, when introducing DuoMobile, the
onus of responsibility for second-factor authentication is shifted
almost entirely on to the employee. In this new, BYOD-centric au-
thentication system, the employee is responsible for downloading
and learning how to use a new app, as well as linking their work
profile to this app. This touches a number of usability, privacy and
security concerns, both from an app perspective and from a system
perspective. This unique interaction of factors makes comparing
these two systems directly a challenge.
Prior to examining our outcome measures of ease of use, rela-
tive advantage, and compatibility, a deeper analysis exploring the
method of enrollment in the DuoMobile system (pre-deadline/early
adopters vs. deadline mandated) played a major role in determining
how DuoMobile was (negatively) perceived with regards to relative
advantage and compatibility. One of the strengths of our study is its
ability to explore perceptions not only about a novel technical sys-
tem introduction, but also conditions within the institution leading
up to this adoption. In line with research on technology adoption
within organizations [44], it is clear that employee’s perception of
how voluntary or involuntary a mandated technology adoption
is will ultimately have a major impact on how this technology is
perceived overall. Universities and organizations should strive to
make employees feel as though they are a part of a newer, more
secure system rather than make users feel forced and obligated to
change their routines, especially when authenticating to a system.
In comparing the factors of ease of use, relative advantage, and
compatibility, we found that our participants considered the phys-
ical token system easier to use than the new DuoMobile system.
However, participants still reported finding the token very incon-
venient in terms of compatibility. When comparing ease of use and
compatibility, the participants noted that the new DuoMobile sys-
tem was more compatible with their workflow for authentication.
What we note here, and what is, in many ways, a theme of this
study, is a dichotomy between finding one system easier to use
than the other (token-based), but also realizing and appreciating
the benefits of a newer system (DuoMobile).
One explicit expression of this was given by one of the partic-
ipants who noted the following: “The tokens are inconvenient. I
was first resistant to using my personal phone for 2FA, but it was
a lot more convenient so I gave in.” In many instances within the
responses, the participants noted that they ultimately found the
DuoMobile authentication to be more convenient than the token,
primarily because they seldom had to worry about losing track of
their mobile phones, whereas this was a common concern with
the tokens. Participants noted this frequently, with most of the
comments being summed up by two participants: “It is much easier
than the token, since I almost always have my phone with me”; “It
is more convenient to use my iPhone than to rummage around in
my bag and find my token.”
After comparing differences of perceived ease of use, relative
advantage, and compatibility between the physical token and the
DuoMobile app, we also attempted to establish factors that could
impact the positive or negative attributes influencing the percep-
tions of the newer DuoMobile system. Based on the initial variables
we chose to analyze, we found that very few items had an ultimate
effect on how DuoMobile was perceived. The exceptions to this
were whether a phone had a fingerprint reader feature, and whether
the participants had used the DuoMobile app previously. While the
latter is fairly obvious, we do believe the fingerprint reader finding
is of interest as it ties the ownership of devices with particular
features to increased technology acceptance of 2FA.
When discussing how the DuoMobile app operates earlier in the
paper, one use case that was not described is how the app operates
when an individual’s phone is locked. In such a circumstance, an
individual is required to first unlock their phone before confirming
the DuoMobile request for authentication. As such, the fact that
individuals with a fingerprint reader on their phones would find
DuoMobile to be more useful, hearkens back to a simplistic GOMS
technique; the keystroke-level model [15]. In the event of using
DuoMobile when a device is locked, an individual with a fingerprint
reader only needs to place their finger on their phone, and then
can immediately authenticate. A user without a fingerprint scanner,
on the other hand, would have to enter their passcode or other
authentication mode (of varying complexity), thus adding additional
button presses and time to their authentication task.
5.2 BYOD Concerns
We consider it quite interesting that the token was so highly rated
within our scale items compared to DuoMobile, as the DuoMo-
bile system was designed to be highly compatible for various use
cases. However, when further investigating comments made via
our open-ended questions, we soon encountered a theme applying
simultaneously positive and negative attributes towards DuoMo-
bile as a result of the new 2FA system requiring a personal device
to operate on. One participant said the following: “I like the fact
that there are multiple options: call office phone, call home phone,
call cell phone, punch in numbers, I resent the fact that I might be
expected to use a personal device to access work functions.”
This theme was quite common throughout our responses. We
believe that this resentment of BYOD usage for 2FA within insti-
tutions caused a certain amount of animosity towards both the
administration for enforcing the new app being used, as well as
towards the app itself via proxy. For many, this outcry about being
required to use personal devices was also accompanied by a desire
to be compensated for doing so. As one participant summed up: “A
good exemplar of the [institution] expecting more, but not com-
pensating for it.” Financial compensation was not the only concern
brought up by participants. Others considered the switch to this
BYOD system an infringement on the established separation of
their personal and work lives: “I prefer to keep work and personal
as separate issues so I’m bothered by having to use my personal
phone for business purposes.” This opinion, which was mentioned
by several participants, is in opposition to proponents of BYOD
systems, who argue that many people would like to use the same
devices for work and play, and would not like a second device [62].
Although it was common for some participants to express nega-
tive notions about using their own device for work purposes, not
every participant in the study felt this way. As noted by one of our
participants: “I have always used my personal phone for business
use. DuoMobile is a very, very small part of this. I very frequently
respond to university email, make business calls, and may [work
on] other work related tasks on my phone.” Beyond completing
work tasks on phones, other participants felt that this transition
to BYOD would be preferred over having a work-issued phone: “I
would rather use my personal phone for work than be required to
carry two phones - my personal phone and a work phone.”
Another prevalent theme found when discussing new issues cre-
ated by DuoMobile was that of professionalism. This is one aspect
of second-factor authentication that we do not believe has been
explored previously. Many of our participants reported feelings of
lack of perceived professionalism across different circumstances
when being required to use their mobile phone to authenticate. As
one participant stated: “I don’t think it is right to be asked to use
my personal expensive device for a work related function daily. I es-
pecially don’t like getting it out in front of undergraduate students
because I think it looks very unprofessional.”
Even more troubling, within the institution, some individuals
reported not being able to use their mobile phones during work
hours, thus making their work difficult to complete at times: “I am
not permitted to use my phone on the clinical unit at [location
redacted], which prevents me from checking items for students and
from students.” Based on several comments like these, it is clear
that in certain circumstances, BYOD setups can create situations in
which an employee would be unable to complete their work within
a phone-based 2FA system. Not surprisingly, these few individuals
who encountered scenarios in which they could not use DuoMo-
bile at work, or might have trouble using DuoMobile at work had
significantly lower perceived ease of use(F(11,120)=1.96, p<.05) and
relative advantage (F(24,106)=1.66, p<.05) for DuoMobile, over the
token. Even further, by instituting such a system, an institution
can effectively hinder the ability of one of their own employees to
complete their work due to conflicting workplace policies.
When exploring these concepts of BYOD within the newly de-
ployed 2FA system, we can see that many factors arise such as
convenience (positively), as well as device compensation and pro-
fessionalism (negatively). While many past studies have focused
on technical specifications and security concerns related to BYOD
transitions, we have been unable to find any works that elaborate
on the day-to-day effects felt at the employee level, post-adoption.
These observed side effects are not yet explored and should be
flagged as an area for future research.
5.3 Technical Security Concerns
One potentially overlooked consideration by an institution choos-
ing to implement a digital 2FA authentication system is that, in
some instances, the second factor becomes nullified. An increas-
ing number of individuals now use their phones as primary work
devices. Previously, when using a token, if an individual was com-
pleting work on their phone and needed to authenticate themselves
into a secured system, they would be required to use their phone
and the physical token to authenticate. However, in this new par-
adigm, the sign-in attempt and second-factor authentication all
take place on the same device, without any further authentication
being required. One of the participants stated this concern quite
succinctly: “Since you can use your cell phone for 2FA, AND you
can login to secure pages with it, there really isn’t a two factor
there.... you can do it all on your phone.”
From a system administrator’s perspective, this could be viewed
as a potential weakness and security concern, in particular, with
increasing usage of mobile devices for core work activities. Com-
bining this with the fact that many modern smartphones store
usernames and passwords in login fields, and a reported 26% of our
participants do not use any sort of passcode lock on their phone,
it is conceivable that these devices pose a significant security risk,
which would allow an attacker to breach a secured system just
by obtaining access to one device. As we predicted such security
concerns might arise, we also queried the participants about hypo-
thetical security enforcement policies being added to their devices,
as such possible enforcement could be implemented in the future.
Framed by referencing many corporate email systems [2, 18],
which enforce strict phone security policies such as a minimum
password length, remote wipe features etc., we asked the partici-
pants if they believed the university should be allowed to perform a
security check on their phones, or even implement corporate secu-
rity restrictions on their device, similar to the aforementioned cor-
porate email settings. Our participants were almost universally op-
posed to such policies, with 80% stating that they would be against
such a policy, if issued by the university. One participant summed
up their feelings about such an implementation: “It is MY PER-
SONAL device. It does not belong to the University and they did
not contribute towards its purchase. I do not feel they can tell me
what I must do with my PERSONAL items.” Another participant
argued that enforcements should be handled at the institutional
level, and not on employees’ phones: “Security should be tightened
