I have considerable experience building web applications using Python and Django on my Linux machine. However, when I decided to venture into developing desktop applications that can run on both Windows and Linux, I found myself unsure of where to start.

While I understand that I can develop Windows desktop applications on a Windows machine, I am quite comfortable with Linux and prefer to stay within this environment. Could anyone provide guidance on the tools and frameworks I should use to develop a simple Windows desktop application? For now, I plan to target Windows 7 as my initial platform.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Response:**

To develop cross-platform desktop applications using Python, you should consider using a GUI toolkit that has Python bindings. The two most popular options are Tkinter and Qt.

- **Tkinter**: This is the de facto standard for Python GUI development and is included with the standard Python distribution. It is cross-platform and supports Windows, Linux, and macOS. Tkinter is straightforward to use and is a good choice if you want a lightweight and easy-to-learn solution.

- **Qt (PyQt or PySide)**: Qt is a powerful and feature-rich framework that is widely used for developing complex and high-performance applications. It is also cross-platform and supports Windows, Linux, and macOS. PyQt and PySide are the Python bindings for Qt. While Qt offers more advanced features and a more modern look and feel, it has a steeper learning curve compared to Tkinter. Additionally, Qt's licensing is more restrictive than Tkinter, but it does offer a path to C++ programming if you are interested in that.

Given your comfort with Linux and your goal of targeting Windows 7, Tkinter might be the best starting point due to its simplicity and ease of use. Once you are familiar with Tkinter, you can always explore more advanced options like Qt if you need additional features or a more sophisticated user interface.

I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck with your desktop application development!
