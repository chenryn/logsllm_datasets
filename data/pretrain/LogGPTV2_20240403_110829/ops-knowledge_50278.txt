User: I am pretty familiar with building web based apps using python django on my linux machine. But when I decided to try my hand at building desktop applications that can run on windows/linux I didn't know where to begin.
I know I can surely build windows desktop application on windows machine. But I am pretty comfortable with linux and don't want to get out of that comfort zone. Can anyone guide me as to what tools can I begin with to develop a simple windows desktop application. I would target windows 7 for starters.
Any guidance is hugely appreciated.
Assistant: What you are looking for is a GUI tool-kit with bindings to python. Tkinter is the de facto standard for python GUI and is cross platform. Qt is also a popular choice but the license is more restrictive then Tkinter but will allow you to transition into C++ programming with Qt easier if that is something you may want to do down the road. The choice up to you.
