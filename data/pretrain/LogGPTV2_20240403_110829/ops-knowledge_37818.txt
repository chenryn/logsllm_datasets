User: Please explain what is microservice architecture, and how to realize the splitting, deployment and governance of services?
Assistant: The microservice architecture is a software architecture based on the idea of service, which divides a large system into multiple small and independent service units, each service unit has its own independent business logic, and communicates through lightweight communication ( such as REST, RPC, etc.) communicate with each other. In this way, complex systems can be decomposed into independent units that are easy to maintain and expand, thereby improving system reliability, scalability, and maintainability. When implementing the microservice architecture, it is necessary to split services, split a large system into multiple small services, and each service is responsible for a specific functional module. At the same time, each service needs to have its own independent development, testing, deployment, and operation and maintenance processes to ensure loose coupling, independent deployment, and independent maintenance between services. The splitting of services can be carried out based on different business domains, different technical implementations, and different data storage methods. The splitting process can be carried out through domain modeling, analysis of business processes and data processes, and fine-grained design. Service deployment can be carried out using container technology (such as Docker), and each service unit can be packaged as an independent container image, which can be easily deployed, upgraded and rolled back. At the same time, in order to ensure high availability of services, it is also necessary to deploy and manage services by means of load balancing and fault tolerance mechanisms. Service governance is a key factor to ensure the stable, safe and efficient operation of the microservice architecture, including service registration and discovery, service routing and load balancing, fault recovery, service monitoring and log management, security protection, etc. Service governance needs to be supported by a series of technical means and tools, such as service registry (such as ZooKeeper, etcd, consul, etc.), API gateway (such as Zuul, Kong, etc.), fuse (such as Hystrix, etc.), log collection components (such as Rizhiyi, Zipkin, etc.), etc.
