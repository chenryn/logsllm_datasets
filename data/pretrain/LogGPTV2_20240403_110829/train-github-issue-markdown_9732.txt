I am currently working on an application that utilizes Material-UI along with Server-Side Rendering (SSR). On certain pages of my app, I encounter a warning message stating:

```
Warning: Prop `className` did not match. 
Server: "a-224 b-231 c-241 d-293" 
Client: "a-224 b-231 c-241 d-284"
```

(Note: For simplicity, I have replaced the long class names with placeholders such as `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.)

The discrepancy is specifically in the suffix of the last class name, where the server renders `"d-293"` while the client renders `"d-284"`. This suggests that some classes are being added on the server but not on the client, causing the class index suffixes to become inconsistent.

### Investigation
I attempted to trace the issue and provide a concrete example, but it has proven to be quite challenging. My application makes extensive use of the `Hidden` component, and since I am using SSR, I have implemented the CSS version. However, when I switch to the JavaScript implementation, the problem disappears.

### Question
Is there a built-in tool or method available to debug the class generation process on both the server and the client? Such a tool would help me better understand and resolve this issue.

### Environment
- **Material-UI Version:** Latest Beta

### Additional Notes
- I have searched through the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
