I have an app using material-ui and SSR. On some pages of my app, I get a
warning like:
    Warning: Prop `className` did not match. Server: .... "a-224 b-231 c-241 d-293" Client: "a-224 b-231 c-241 d-284"
(I replaced the long classnames with a, b, c, d). But the mismatch is on the
"suffix" of the last className. "d-293" on server vs "d-284" on client.
So it seems that at some point, there is some classes added on the server and
not on the client, and it's breaking the classes index suffix.  
I tried to trace the problem, and wanted to detect the problem to show an
example but it's quite difficult.
I do have a lot of "Hidden" components in my app, and as I'm using SSR, I use
the css implementation. As soon as I switch on the JS one, the problem
disappear.
I was wondering if there is some builtin tool to debug the generator on the
server and on the client, so I could more easily understand the problem ?
