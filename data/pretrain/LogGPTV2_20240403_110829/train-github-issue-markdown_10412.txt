## üêõ Bug
I am using both PyTorch 1.5 (stable) and nightly build (1.6.0.dev20200611).  
Sometimes I need to run code in v1.5 and use files saved by `torch.save` from
the nightly build.  
However, PyTorch 1.5 fails to `torch.load` such files.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  * PyTorch nightly
    import torch
    a = torch.randn(1)
    torch.save(a, 'a.pt')
  * PyTorch 1.5
    import torch
    torch.load('a.pt')
Then it shows the following error message
Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "", line 1, in  
File "/home/seungjun/local/anaconda3/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-
packages/torch/serialization.py", line 586, in load  
with _open_zipfile_reader(f) as opened_zipfile:  
File "/home/seungjun/local/anaconda3/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-

_C.PyTorchFileReader(name_or_buffer))

please report a bug to PyTorch. Attempted to read a PyTorch file with version
4, but the maximum supported version for reading is 3. Your PyTorch
installation may be too old.
## Expected behavior
I expect PyTorch 1.5 to load files without error.  
Current behavior could be due to the update in PyTorchFileReader but I assume
1.5 and 1.6 should be compatible as their version number is close to each
other.
