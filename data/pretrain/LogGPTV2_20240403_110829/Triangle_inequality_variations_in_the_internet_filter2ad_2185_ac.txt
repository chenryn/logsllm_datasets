the effect of rare high-latency measurements when we use a ﬁxed
list of the most recent latency measurements. A high-frequency
sampling rate will observe more high-latency measurements, but
those measurements will pass through the list more quickly. A
low-frequency sampling rate does not observe high-latency mea-
surements very often, but when it does, they remain in the list for
a long period of time. This variation is typically mitigated through
the use of median latency measurements, but since the IQR remains
relatively stable it would also be safe to consider alternative aggre-
gates (such as the mean) restricted to the middle 50% of the data.
In conclusion, 10% of the pairs of nodes in our data sets exhibit
signiﬁcant changes in latency for the duration of the measurement.
1We use 5 minute intervals because this is the granularity of K200-
1000pairs-5min (see Section 3)
Figure 7: Percentage of TIVs out of the total number of trian-
gles for the K200-allpairs-1h data set.
These variations are due mainly to load-based and routing-based
causes and do not come from non-optimal choices of measurement
parameters such as sampling interval or start time. Thus, we ensure
that the triangle inequality violations we study next are not mea-
surement illusions but real properties of the latencies we collected.
5. TRIANGLE INEQUALITY VARIATIONS
In this section, we study the variation of triangle inequality vi-
olations and examine how well aggregate data sets that combine
measurements taken over long periods of time capture the TIVs
that were present during the measurements.
5.1 TIVs vary over time
We count the number of triangle inequality violations after each
sampling interval in the K200-allpairs-1h data set. We consider
only those violations for which the difference between the sum of
the short sides (the detour path) and the long side (the direct path) is
larger than both 10ms and 10% of the latency of the long side. By
considering only those violations that are signiﬁcant, we protect our
results from overstating the number of TIVs because of measure-
ment error. Furthermore, applications that use triangle inequality
violations to identify detour paths seek signiﬁcant violations due to
the overhead of relaying along the detour path.
Figure 7 shows the number of TIVs at every hour during the
measurement. The vertical axis represents the percentage of bad
triangles after each interval, out of all triples that have been mea-
sured during the interval. We deﬁne the median TIVs to be the
TIVs computed using the median latency for each pair. The per-
centage of median TIVs is represented by the horizontal line at
1.34%. Figure 7 indicates that triangle inequality violations vary
in time. However, at no point during the measurement process is
the number of violations lower than what we would obtain using
the medians. Thus, data sets that represent multiple measurements
by their median values are conservative: they reveal fewer triangle
inequalities than there were during the measurement process. Of
course, if the lost TIVs are all short-lived, it may be beneﬁcial not
to reveal them; for instance, we only want to use long-lived TIVs
for ﬁnding detour paths. We study next the longevity of TIVs.

5.2 Longevity
What happens to a TIV seen at one point during the measure-
ment? Does it appear in the set of TIVs computed with medians?
We expect that, due to extreme values in latency measurements,
many triangles are short-lived—they are the effect of an unusually
high latency.
We deﬁne the longevity of a TIV as the number of intervals in
which it appears. We do not require the intervals to be consecu-
tive to avoid bias due to missing or extreme measurements. We
compute the longevity for three categories of TIVs: all TIVs seen
during the measurement (intermediate TIVs), all median TIVs, and
all TIVs seen during the measurement but not when using medi-
ans (lost TIVs). Figure 8 shows the distributions of longevities for
TIVs in the three categories.
More than 80% of all TIVs have a longevity of less than 5 hours,
while almost all (≥99%) TIVs computed with medians are seen for
more than 5 hours and more than half of them for more than a day.
Thus, using medians eliminates the short-term TIVs.
Of all TIVs, only 18% have a longevity of more than 5 hours.
However, of these long-lived TIVs, 72% (not shown in the ﬁg-
ure) are lost—they do not appear as median TIVs. Such viola-
tions are present long enough to be able to help an overlay routing
application—by exposing a shorter detour—but are not captured
when the measurements are aggregated.
Scenarios where the medians create a TIV that does not exist,
as in Figure 1, are extremely infrequent. For example, 128 trian-
gles (0.1%) appear only when using medians and never during the
measurement. Using medians only ignores 1.5% of the TIVs that
appear more than half the time using individual latency measure-
ments.
6. ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO COMPUTE TIVS
In this section, we propose alternative ways to compute TIVs
from intermediate measurements and discuss their effects on the
performance of latency-sensitive distributed applications. Network
coordinate and positioning systems do not adapt to TIVs very well:
preserving many intermediate TIVs in the ﬁnal data set will likely
provide a lower-bound on performance. On the other hand, detour
routing applications perform better when more TIVs are available.
We investigate four ways of computing the number of TIVs:
all-median, short-sides-min, long-side-min and all-min. We de-
scribed all-median in Section 5.1.
In short-sides-min, when we
verify whether a triple forms a TIV, we consider the minimum la-
tencies for the potential short sides and the median latency for the
long side. In long-side-min, we use medians for the short sides and
minimum for the long side. In all-min, as in other previous studies
[11, 3], we use the minimum latency values for every edge of the
triangle.
All-median is conservative. While it eliminates many short-term
TIVs, it also ignores 72% of the TIVs longer than ﬁve hours that ap-
pear during the measurement (§ 5.2). Intuitively, the long-side-min
method decreases the number of TIVs that are preserved and pro-
vides a more conservative data set for evaluating latency-reducing
overlay networks. On the other hand, the short-side-min approach
preserves more TIVs and offers a worst case scenario for network
coordinates.
We deﬁne ﬁnal TIVs as the violations computed using aggre-
gates over intermediate measurements, while the kept (or preserved
TIVs) are the intermediate TIVs that are also ﬁnal. Figure 9 shows
the distribution of the fraction of TIVs that are kept by each of the
four methods. Every point represents the fraction of TIVs that are
kept for each longevity value. Table 2 shows the percentage of
intermediate TIVs that are preserved and of ﬁnal TIVs that never
appear during the measurement (are not intermediate TIVs).
Short-sides-min loses less long-lived TIVs than all-median but
also keeps more short-lived TIVs. Of all TIVs longer than 5 hours,
all-median keeps 28% while short-sides-min keeps almost 60%.
Using either of the two methods will better reﬂect the performance
of latency-reducing detour routing applications. Short-sides-min
keeps more TIVs but also keeps more than 15% of triples which
never violate the triangle inequality in individual measurements.
All-median provides a more conservative estimation, biased towards
keeping long TIVs and losing short ones.
All-min and long-side-min keep about as many short-lived TIVs
as short-sides-min and all-median respectively. However, neither
all-min nor long-side-min keep as many of the very long-lived TIVs
as the other two methods. In conclusion, the short-side-min method
of computing TIVs is suitable for applications that require an upper-
bound on the number of TIVs. It helps provide a lower bound on the
performance of network coordinate systems. Although used in the
evaluations of several network coordinate and positioning systems
[3, 11], all-min understates heavily the number of TIVs (it keeps
only 5%) and thus does not provide an accurate latency snapshot
for evaluation.

computed with short-sides-min do not appear at all during the measurement.
7. RELATED WORK
We divide previous research related to triangle inequality viola-
tions in the Internet into two parts: studies on end-to-end latency
[12, 8, 4, 9] and studies on the performance of network coordinate
systems [13, 6, 18].
Savage et al. [12] measure latencies between geographically di-
verse Internet nodes and show that more than 20% of the pairs of
nodes form long sides in TIVs. Zheng et al. [8] argue, using data
collected from the GREN research network, that TIVs are a persis-
tent, widespread and natural consequence of Internet routing poli-
cies. These studies are limited to aggregate data sets computed over
long periods of time. None of them treat TIVs as dynamic proper-
ties of the Internet. We use real-world latency data sets to show
that the number of TIVs varies with time and that by aggregating
data with medians or minimums of many measurements, we risk
missing many existing violations.
Several studies examine TIVs in relation to the impact they have
on network coordinate [2, 1] and positioning systems [3]. Because
these systems treat the Internet as a metric space—where TIVs are
prohibited—they may obtain inaccurate results. Lee et al.
[13]
show how TIVs in latency data sets affect the accuracy and suit-
ability of embeddings. Wang et al. [6] identify problems caused by
TIVs in the neighbor selection process of embedding and position-
ing algorithms [2, 3] and propose a simple TIV alert that eliminates
the measurements that lead to severe violations. That triangle in-
equality violations frustrate network coordinates is not necessarily
bad. PeerWise [4] uses embedding errors in coordinate systems to
discover which pairs of nodes are more likely to beneﬁt from a de-
tour (i.e., are long sides in TIVs) or offer a detour (i.e., are short
sides in TIVs). All of these studies treat TIVs as a static network
property and compute violations based on combinations of multi-
ple measurements. They may beneﬁt from our observation that we
can conservatively estimate the number of TIVs with the minimum
instead of the median for the short sides of the triangles.
8. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we offer new evidence into the properties of In-
ternet triangle inequality violations. We show, using real world la-
tency data sets of varying sizes and granularities, that TIVs are real
and not merely illusions or artifacts of measurements. The number
of TIVs varies over time and the TIVs present during the measure-
ment are not necessarily preserved when many measurements are
aggregated using median or minimum latencies. We provide simple
guidelines for the evaluation and design of systems whose perfor-
mance depends on triangle inequality violations, such as network
coordinates or detour routing.
