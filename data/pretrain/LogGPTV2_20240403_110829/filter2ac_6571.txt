### Title: Vulnerabilities in Let's Encrypt's Distributed Domain Validation

#### Abstract
Following the recent off-path attacks against Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Let's Encrypt implemented a distributed domain validation system in 2020. This system validates domains from multiple vantage points to ensure security even against strong on-path Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) adversaries. The principle behind this approach is that even if an adversary can hijack traffic from some vantage points, they will not be able to intercept all traffic to all nameservers in a domain.

In this work, we identify two central design issues in Let's Encrypt's distributed domain validation that make it vulnerable to downgrade attacks:
1. The vantage points are selected from a small, fixed set.
2. The way vantage points select nameservers in target domains can be manipulated by a remote adversary.

We develop off-path methodologies based on these observations to launch downgrade attacks against Let's Encrypt. These attacks reduce the validation process from "multiple vantage points to multiple nameservers" to "multiple vantage points to a single, attacker-selected nameserver."

Through experimental evaluations with Let's Encrypt and a dataset of 1 million Let's Encrypt-certified domains, we find that our off-path attacker can successfully launch downgrade attacks against more than 24.53% of the domains, forcing Let's Encrypt to use a single nameserver for validation. We then develop an automated off-path attack against the "single-server" domain validation for these 24.53% of domains, obtaining fraudulent certificates for more than 107,000 domains, which constitute 10% of the 1 million domains in our dataset.

We also evaluate our attacks against other major Certificate Authorities (CAs) and compare the security and effort required to launch these attacks. Our findings indicate that our downgrade attacks negate any security advantages that Let's Encrypt has over other CAs.

#### Introduction
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a critical component of internet security, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of online communications. However, recent off-path attacks have exposed vulnerabilities in PKI. In response, Let's Encrypt introduced a distributed domain validation system in 2020. This system aims to enhance security by validating domains from multiple vantage points, thereby mitigating the risk of on-path MitM attacks.

Despite this enhancement, our research reveals that Let's Encrypt's distributed domain validation is susceptible to downgrade attacks due to two key design flaws. First, the vantage points are chosen from a limited, predefined set, making them predictable and easier to target. Second, the method by which vantage points select nameservers in target domains can be influenced by a remote adversary, allowing them to manipulate the validation process.

#### Methodology
To exploit these vulnerabilities, we developed off-path methodologies that leverage the identified design issues. Our approach involves the following steps:

1. **Vantage Point Selection Manipulation**: By manipulating the selection of vantage points, we force the validation process to rely on a smaller, more predictable set of vantage points.
2. **Nameserver Selection Manipulation**: We manipulate the way vantage points select nameservers, ensuring that the validation process uses a single, attacker-controlled nameserver.

#### Experimental Evaluation
We conducted extensive experiments using Let's Encrypt and a dataset of 1 million Let's Encrypt-certified domains. Our results show that our off-path attacker can successfully launch downgrade attacks against more than 24.53% of the domains. For these domains, Let's Encrypt is forced to use a single nameserver for validation, significantly reducing the security of the process.

Furthermore, we developed an automated off-path attack to obtain fraudulent certificates for more than 107,000 domains, representing 10% of the 1 million domains in our dataset. This demonstrates the severity of the vulnerability and the potential for widespread abuse.

#### Comparison with Other CAs
We also evaluated our attacks against other major CAs to compare the security and effort required. Our findings indicate that the downgrade attacks we developed are equally effective against other CAs, suggesting that Let's Encrypt's security benefits are negated by these vulnerabilities.

#### Conclusion
Our research highlights significant vulnerabilities in Let's Encrypt's distributed domain validation system. By exploiting the design flaws in vantage point and nameserver selection, we were able to launch successful downgrade attacks, obtaining fraudulent certificates for a substantial number of domains. These findings underscore the need for Let's Encrypt and other CAs to address these vulnerabilities and improve the security of their domain validation processes.
