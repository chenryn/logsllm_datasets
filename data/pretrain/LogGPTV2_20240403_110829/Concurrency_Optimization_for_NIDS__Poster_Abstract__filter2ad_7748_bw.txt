Rapid analytical platforms for biofluid profiling in discovery metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Adam King, Waters corporation and Murdoch University, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Ian D Wilson, Robert S Plumb, Paul D Rainville, Robert D Trengove
Metabolic phenotyping has been widely employed in large epidemiological studies in the effort to discovery more about health and disease UPLC 
and hybrid mass spectrometers have been essential tools in analyzing the matrices chosen for these studies However, long acquisition times 
per samples (>15 mins) has meant large sets, typically employed in epidemiological and biobanking studies, can take days to analyze, ultimately 
putting strain on resources Furthermore, this has led to sample acquisition being performed across multiple runs for the same data set, risking the 
development of batch effects when attempting to recombine the data In order to address these issues, a suite of rapid profiling methods have been 
developed, reducing run time and solvent consumption by 75% These methods were employed for the analysis of rodent urine and human plasma 
lipid extracts from breast cancer patients, using a Waters Acquity I-class UPLC system coupled to a Synapt G2-Si QTof mass spectrometer Standard 
LC-MS methods for metabolite and lipid profiling using 21 mm id columns were geometrically scaled, reducing the id, analysis times, injection 
volumes and mobile phase flow rate, while ultimately increasing the linear velocity Each scaling demonstrated a preservation of the retention 
mechanism with relative retention times of probe compounds being maintained Incorporating the ion mobility schema improved resolution of co-
eluting ions, ultimately improving spectral clarity and with the generation of collisional cross section values, increased confidence in identification 
through database searches

DSM Food Specialties develops and sells process flavors Understanding flavor at molecular level and the impact on sensory flavor perception, enables 
steering of the desired product properties during processing This poster presentation outlines the workflow we have developed to identify mutual 
relations between metabolites and sensory attributes Thirty different commercially available DSM process flavors were characterized both in sensory 
as well as chemically For sensory evaluation, QDA (Quantitative Descriptive Analyse was done with a trained Savoury panel (n=12) on 46 attributes in 
odour, flavor and mouthfeel To cover the broadest possible range of chemical compound classes, an untargeted sensomics approach was developed 
that combines four different complementary analytical methods to analyze the volatile and non-volatile metabolites that are possibly related to the flavor 
of our process flavors The non-volatiles were analyzed by NMR and a GC-FID/MS method in combination with oximation and silylation All volatiles were 
analyzed by an SPME-GC-FID/MS method LC-MS was done for general profiling of peptides up to about 15 amino acids Sample preparation and method 
development was done for all four analytical methods Using these methods, all process flavors were characterized successfully Multivariate data-analysis 
was applied to identify possible correlations between the chemical analytical data and sensory data Visualization tools are optimized and together with 
DSM colleagues in Savory Ingredients, more detailed data mining is being done to be able to translate findings into answers to business questions A 
holistic metabolic profiling was applied to develop models to describe flavor in our process flavors

without sample preparation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Petra Paizs, Imperial College London, United Kingdom

Faecal metabolomics can provide a unique metabolic signature of intestinal function in a non-invasive manner and is crucial for the identification 
of diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in gut-related diseases However, this relies on homogenous distribution of biomarkers within samples 
Mass spectrometric imaging (MSI) is a key analytical tool for biomarker discovery, though most studies have concentrated on tissue analysis rather 
than faeces Here, we present a high-throughput analysis pipeline using REIMS imaging, which allows for near-real time analysis and mapping of 
metabolites in whole fresh human faecal samples Our strategy allows in-depth analysis of the diversity and complexity of the faecal metabolome 
by visualizing the relative abundance and spatial distribution of metabolites This pipeline has been optimized and validated as a high-throughput 
tool for direct-from-sample analysis with minimal sample preparation: Whole faecal samples (<1 hour of bowel evacuation) were segmented into 
cross-sectional plates (5mm) and analyzed at 1 mm resolution in negative and positive ionization modes Pre-processing of data and statistical 
analysis in R Studio (V1044) allowed for targeted or untargeted analysis Faeces from control patients with no known gastrointestinal disease were 
investigated and a detailed analysis of key features was performed In the fatty acid region, we observed the most abundant peaks at m/z 25525, 
28125, 27925, 28325, and 31115 to be distributed heterogeneously We are now looking at performing observational studies in colorectal cancer 
patients to investigate the spatial distribution of potential biomarkersThe mapping of metabolites through REIMS imaging demonstrates the first MSI 
technique for faecal sample analysis

Changes in the metabolic profile of plasma reflect the metabolic state of an organism and may reveal disease biomarkers or depict the phenotype 
of an animal model Fast and reliable methods for high throughput are needed for non-targeted screening of samples The aim of this study was 
the comparison of plasma metabolite measurements among a group of wild-type and Klk8 deficient mice across four methods; C18 HPLC column 
attached to an LC-MS instrument (6550 iFunnel Q-TOF, Agilent), MRMS instrument (7T, scimaX, Bruker) coupled with an ESI source (FIA - direct 
infusion) or MALDI, and MALDI-TOF-MS instrument (rapifleX, Bruker) Ions in positive polarity mode were acquired Results were analyzed by 
Metaboanalyst statistical toolkit (Metaboanalyst 40, McGill Univeristy) and linear mixed-effects models (lme4 package, R language) Number of 
peaks identified by each instrument, detection method and number of significant peaks were scored by different statistical models In positive 
polarity the MRMS instrument detected the highest number of peaks (6682 by FIA and 5246 by MALDI) For FIA method, Metaboanalyst toolkit 
found 366 peaks in positive mode, whereas mixed-effects model analyses reported 677 peaks In conclusion, flow injection analysis (FIA) on the 
MRMS instrument followed by mixed-effect model analysis may aptly serve the purpose of fast metabolite profiling of plasma

rMSIcleanup: an open-source computational tool for matrix-related peak annotation in MALDI-MSI
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Gerard Baquer Gómez, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Gerard Baquer, Pere Ràfols, Maria Garcia-Altares, Maria Vinaixa, Xavier Correig
Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (LDI-MSI) is a label-free technology that provides spatially resolved molecular information 
from tissue sections LDI-MSI has been broadly adopted in proteomics and peptidomics Its use in metabolomics has received much attention as 
a novel tool to understand mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as cancer or diabetes However, conventional organic matrices used 
in MALDI-MSI cause spectral interferences in the low m/z range which seriously hamper metabolomics data processing As an alternative, several 
matrix-free techniques such as sputtered metal nanolayer deposition have been used to significantly reduce such interferences With the aim of 
expanding LDI-MSI usage to metabolomics applications we are developing rMSIcleanup, an open-source R package to annotate exogenous signals 
related to the ionization source (organic matrix or metal layer) based on its chemical composition The development version of rMSIcleanup is 
available at https://githubcom/gbaquer/rMSIcleanup As the first validation, rMSIcleanup was challenged using images acquired with a sputtered 
silver nanolayer Silver clusters previously reported in literature were consistently identified and chemically unfeasible cluster patterns showed 
lower similarity scores A second validation step is in progress aiming to replicate the results using MALDI-MSI images This includes a dataset 
containing images acquired using the most common MALDI matrices and both TOF and FTICR spectrometers In conclusion, we have developed 
an open-source software tool that confidently annotates silver-related peaks in Ag-LDI-MS which anticipates its applicability to MALDI-MSI Once 
demonstrated its performance in MALDI-MSI, rMSIcleanup will pave the path to the use of common organic matrices for metabolomics studies

Discriminant analysis and feature selection in hyperspectral imaging using CORRS-CV
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Guillermo Quintas, Leitat Technological Center, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Juan Daniel Sanjuan, David Pérez-Guaita, Julia Kuligowski
Biomarker identification through hyperspectral imaging is gaining popularity in the clinical field Hyperspectral imaging generates large, complex 
datasets that require high-throughput data processing and data mining for biological analysis The application of multivariate discriminant analysis 
using bilinear models such as PLS-DA to hyperspectral images requires to unfold the spatial directions in a two-way matrix, resulting in a loss of 
spatial information and structure During model development, internal validation methods such as random k-fold cross-validation (CV) are widely 
used However, a selection of the k subsets completely at random results in a loss of spatial structure and pixel-neighbourhood information 
Highly correlated, spatially proximate pixels are distributed simultaneously into train and validation sets, leading to overly optimistic performance 
estimates The use of biological replicates to define k-fold CV splits provides the most accurate estimation of the generalization performance, but it 
is inefficient when the number of replicates is scarce Using simulated data sets as well as real IR and MS imaging data, we show the applicability of 
COnstrained Repeated Random Subsampling–Cross Validation (CORRS-CV) Results show that CORRS-CV avoids overly optimistic effects due to 
spectral oversampling in IR imaging In situations where holding images back for testing is a waste of valuable information, CORRS-CV reduces the 
overly optimistic bias due to the use of test pixels close to the train set Besides, the combined use of CORRS-CV and rank products increases the 
robustness of the selection of candidate biomarkers

Multi-metabolomics strategy sheds light on monoterpene indole alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ryo Nakabayashi, RIKEN CSRS, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Ryo Nakabayashi, Tetsuya Mori, Kei Hashimoto, Kiminori Toyooka, Yutaka Yamada, Hiroshi Tsugawa, Kazuki Saito
Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are one of important pharmaceutical resources in medicinal plants For instance, 135% of Apocynaceae plants 
that produce MIAs were used for medicinal purposes in the world Exploring known and unknown MIAs in natural plant resources is worthwhile in 
metabolomics Here, we established an approach for efficiently finding MIAs in Catharanthus roseus, which is a MIA-producing plant (Apocynaceae) 
Metabolome data were acquired in an untargeted way using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in 15N (nitrogen)-
labeled and non-labeled Catharanthus Principal component analysis using the 15N- and non-labeled MS data in the flowers, leaves, petioles, 
stems, and roots paired a set of non-labeled monoisotopic ion and 15N-labeled counterpart using retention time Mass shift between the ions 
showed the number of N atom in the monoisotopic ions In MS/MS analysis, the mass shift of the product ion m/z 14408 that is derived from indolic 
skeleton was evaluated Finally, the elemental composition of 45 MIAs was identified in the plant Similarity analysis using MS/MS spectra showed 
the commonality or specificity in the spectra Detail MS/MS analysis identified a vintage MIA that has been never found in Catharanthus as well 
as known MIAs such as ajmalicine, catharanthine, perivine, and yohimbine Combined analysis of microscopy and imaging mass spectrometry 
characterized the localization of the newly identified MIA, suggesting a function in a certain tissue The metabolome data will be uploaded to the 
PlaSMA database (http://plasmarikenjp/) at an appropriate time

Discovery of new cholesteryl esters using a mathematical model-assisted UHPLC-MS/MS method
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jin-Lan Zhang, Institute of Materia Medica, CAMS & PUMC, China
Cholesteryl esters (CEs) are composed of the 3-hydroxyl group of cholesterol and a fatty acyl chain through an ester bond Abnormal CE levels are 
often related to various diseases, particularly hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis A mathematical model-assisted ultra-high performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) method has been developed to profile CEs in plasma, different density lipoprotein samples 
from humans, rats, and golden hamsters 81 CE candidates were detected in the above samples, of which 24 CEs were reported in the Human 
Metabolome Database and 57 CEs were newly identified based on a created database of theoretically possible CEs Three mathematical models 
based on the characteristic chromatographic retention behavior related to structural features were established and validated using commercial 
and synthetic CE standards The mathematical model-assisted UHPLC-MS/MS strategy was proposed to provide a global profile and identification 
of CEs With the efficient strategy, 74 CEs in plasma of golden hamster were identified and then quantified in normal and hyperlipidemic golden 
hamsters by dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) 21 CEs among 35 shared potential biomarkers were newly found for hyperlipidemia Our 
study will contribute to the in-depth study of CE functions and the discovery of biomarkers for diseases

Using Knime for the analysis of LC-MS/MS metabolic datasets of amitriptyline and verapamil
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nouf Alourfi, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, United Kingdom
A method for studying metabolic datasets has been developed by using Knime (Konstanz Information Miner) Knime is free and open-source data 
analytics, reporting and visualization platform Our aim is to address the growing variety and complexity of data in this field and thus contribute 
to improving the analysis process in general We demonstrate our approach using datasets derived from an ESI-LC-MS/MS analysis of in vitro 
metabolites of amitriptyline and verapamil using liver microsomes Knime platform has been used to create, treat, share and store the raw ESI-
LC-MS/MS data in a transparent and straightforward way By using our approach, it was possible to automatically generate standard MS data 
visualisations Moreover, we extend Knime by generating putative metabolites and MSMS spectra of our drugs using computational applications 
such as SyGMa and CFM-ID SyGMa consists of a set of reaction rules covering a broad range of phase1 and 2 metabolism that has been derived 
from metabolic reactions demonstrated in the metabolite database which take a place in humans Next, we used a Competitive Fragmentation 
Modeling which is used by CFM-ID to produces a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process and machine learning 
techniques to adapt the model parameters from data This generated model can be used to predict the spectra for chemical structure of a given 
drugs and then computes the predicted spectrum for each candidate and compares it to the input spectrum to rank the candidates metabolites 
according to how closely they match Using this workflow, we are able to assign structures to candidate metabolites within our samples

A significant challenge in metabolomics is result reproducibility and confidence in metabolite identification, which are directly related to the choice 
of analytical instruments, available evidence extracted through data analysis, and quality of the reporting Here two approaches are presented to 
improve reproducibility and reporting in metabolite identification To enable comprehensive data analysis reporting, we present an R markdown 
reporting template [1] that guides the production of text and generates workflow diagrams based on user input This R Markdown template presents 
a set of minimum information requirements specifically for data pre-treatment and data analysis in biomarker discovery (https://githubcom/MSI-
Metabolomics-Standards-Initiative/MIDAS) We will also present mzTab-M, a Data Standard for Sharing Quantitative Results in Mass Spectrometry 
Metabolomics [2] This standard was developed as a joint effort between the Metabolomics Standards Initiative and Proteomics Standards Initiative 
organisations over several years mzTab-M is a simple tab-separated text-format, with highly standardized structures and a detailed specification 
document, tightly coupled to a validation software API, and mandatory controlled vocabulary terms to populate it The format represents final 
quantification values from analyses, as well as the evidence trail in terms of features measured directly from MS (eg, LC/GC-MS, DIMS, etc) and 
the approaches used to identify molecules It allows clear communication of identification ambiguity to readers and has widespread adoption 
potential, for details and implementations see https://githubcom/HUPO-PSI/mzTab Both approaches presented will facilitate more transparent 
and reproducible metabolomics Citation and details: [1]Metabolites2019doi:103390/metabo9030043 [2]Anal Chem2019doi:101021/acs

L-homocysteine Sulfinic Acid and Cysteic Acid as Novel Biomarkers of Acute Myocardial Infarction
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Youngja Park, Korea University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Adnan Khan
Identifying changes in serum metabolites before occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an important approach for finding a novel 
biomarker of AMI In this retrospective cohort study, serum samples obtained from patients at risk of AMI risk (n = 112) and non-risk control (n = 89) 
were tested using high resolution metabolomics (HRM), coupled with LC-MS/MS Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), along with 
univariate analysis using false discovery rate (FDR) at q = 005, were performed to discriminate metabolic profiles and to determine significantly 
different metabolites between healthy control and AMI risk groups PLS-DA significantly separated the AMI risk sera from healthy Altered metabolic 
pathways analysis in KEGG online database showed that biosynthesis of amino acid, 2-ococarboxylic acid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and 
amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were mainly altered in AMI risk sera The metabolites associated with these pathways were mainly 
elevated among AMI patients Further validation and quantifications by MS/MS showed that carnitine, L-homocysteine sulfinic acid (L-HCSA), and 
cysteic acid (CA) were upregulated, while L-cysteine and L-cysteine sulfinic acid (L-CSA) were downregulated, specifically among AMI risk sera 
Additionally these discriminant metabolic profiles and phenotypes among AMI were not related to other factors such as hypertension, smoking or 
alcoholism In conclusion our study suggests that detection of upregulated L-HCSA and CA along with carnitine among AMI risk patient could serve 
as promising non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of AMI

Establishing a Spectral Library and Accurate Mass Retention Time (AMRT) Database for Neonatal Metabolomics Analysis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Anas Kamleh, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Chiara Lavarello, Sebastiano Barco, Igor Fochi, Martina Batolucci, Gino Tripodi, Giuliana Cangemi, Andrea Petretto
Metabolomics is an established discovery tool for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis and novel mechanistic insights of pathophysiological 
processes Liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) is currently the method of choice for metabolome analysis, however, the wide 
variety of chromatographic columns and conditions is presenting a challenge in sharing and interpretation of metabolite identities The metabolic 
standard initiative (MSI) guidelines require identification of metabolites to be based on matching accurate mass, retention time and fragmentation 
spectra to those from authentic standards In order to facilitate sharing of information between groups involved in neonatal metabolomics analysis, 
we have established a spectral library of compounds in the commercial product (IROA) metabolite identification Data in the spectral library was 
acquired using flow injection analysis (FIA) which allowed the fast acquisition of spectra at a wide range of collision energies (0-120, normalized 
collision energy NCE) Additionally, a separate library, with optimized collision energy, was constructed by applying rules of maximal selectivity and 
structural information The latter library is the basis of further confirmation of the identity of compounds in future studies Furthermore, we provide a 
scheme for obtaining the minimum number of metabolite mixtures that provide full coverage of the IROA kit These mixtures were used to establish 
an accurate mass/retention time (AMRT) databases using six different chromatographic columns (three reversed-phase and three HILIC) and 
chromatographic suitability criteria were applied to select the most appropriate methods Metabolite identification in matrices (plasma, urine and 
sweat) were further validated using the established AMRT databases and libraries

Metabolite identification from LC-MS/MS spectra using deep learning
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Svetlana Kutuzova, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Douglas McCloskey, Christian Igel
Mass spectrometry is a powerful high-throughput technology for chemical composition assessment However the data processing of the resulting 
spectra is a major bottleneck for large studies, and in particular the metabolite identification from the mass spectra The joint community effort 
of collecting and maintaining metabolomics spectral databases provides the opportunity to approach the metabolite identification problem with 
powerful but data-hungry algorithms including deep learning We present a novel deep learning based algorithm for compound identification that 
makes a prediction of a structural chemical fingerprint based on a LC-MS/MS spectrum of a compound Both raw spectra and fragmentation tree 
predicted by SIRIUS software are used as an input A Tree-LSTM network is used to process the fragmentation trees alongside with a feed forward 
neural network that captures patterns in the spectral data Our method is validated on the CASMI 2017 challenge dataset While the method does 
not yet outperform the state-of-the-art approach it is shown to be a proof of concept and a solid base for future developments The future work 
would include learning fragmentation rules from the spectrum itself enabling a complete end-to-end spectrum analysis

Prediction Models of Retention Indices: Application to Gas Chromatography Coupled with High Resolution Mass 
Spectrometry for two Column Types: DB-624 and HP-5ms
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Adrian Haiduc, PMI, Switzerland
CO-AUTHORS: E. Dossin, P. Diana, P.A. Guy, N.V. Ivanov, M. Peitsch
Monitoring of volatile and semi-volatile compounds was performed using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to high resolution electron ionization 
mass spectrometry, using both headspace and liquid injection modes on DB-624 and HP-5ms columns A total of 1’300 reference compounds 
(n=400 analyzed on HP-5ms and n=900 on DB-624 columns), including n-alkanes (covering C5 to C30) as reference index markers, were analyzed 
and experimental linear retention indices (LRI) were determined These reference compounds were randomly split into training and validation sets 
LRI for all 1’300 reference compounds were predicted based upon computational Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) models 
using calculated 2D descriptors, and based on multiple approaches: PLS, Lasso regression, stepwise MLR, Genetic Evolution Algorithm predictor 
selection and Neural Networks, with PLS and Lasso providing the fastest calculation and most accurate prediction level Correlation coefficients 
for experimental versus predicted LRI values were calculated at 096 for DB-624 and 098 for HP-5ms for the training sets and at 094 and 095 
for the validation sets, respectively These models were then used to predict LRI values for several thousand reported metabolite compounds 
The predicted LRI values can be used for column type selection as well as increased confidence level in unknown identification by means of the 
Mahalanobis distance
