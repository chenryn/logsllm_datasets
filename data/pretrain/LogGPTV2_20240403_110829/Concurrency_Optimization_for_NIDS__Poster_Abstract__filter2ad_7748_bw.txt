#### P-515: Rapid Analytical Platforms for Biofluid Profiling in Discovery Metabolomics
**Presenting Author:** Adam King, Waters Corporation and Murdoch University, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** Ian D. Wilson, Robert S. Plumb, Paul D. Rainville, Robert D. Trengove

**Abstract:**
Metabolic phenotyping has been widely employed in large epidemiological studies to discover more about health and disease. UPLC and hybrid mass spectrometers have been essential tools for analyzing the matrices chosen for these studies. However, long acquisition times per sample (typically >15 minutes) mean that large datasets, often used in epidemiological and biobanking studies, can take days to analyze, straining resources. This has also led to sample acquisition being performed across multiple runs, risking batch effects when recombining the data.

To address these issues, a suite of rapid profiling methods has been developed, reducing run time and solvent consumption by 75%. These methods were applied to the analysis of rodent urine and human plasma lipid extracts from breast cancer patients using a Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC system coupled with a Synapt G2-Si QTof mass spectrometer. Standard LC-MS methods for metabolite and lipid profiling using 2.1 mm i.d. columns were geometrically scaled, reducing the i.d., analysis times, injection volumes, and mobile phase flow rate while increasing linear velocity. Each scaling preserved the retention mechanism, maintaining relative retention times of probe compounds.

Incorporating ion mobility improved the resolution of co-eluting ions, enhancing spectral clarity and confidence in identification through database searches by generating collisional cross-section values.

#### P-516: Sensomics: Understanding Flavor Properties in Food
**Presenting Author:** Brenda Ammerlaan, DSM Food Specialties, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Raymond Raymaker, Leon Coulier, John Gauvin, Peter Lankhorst, Adriana Carvalho de Souza, Cock Tas, Marjon Kok, Margriet Hendriks, Marieke Nijmeijer, Denise Jacobs, Maurien Olsthoorn

**Abstract:**
DSM Food Specialties develops and sells process flavors. Understanding flavor at the molecular level and its impact on sensory perception enables the steering of desired product properties during processing. This poster outlines the workflow developed to identify mutual relations between metabolites and sensory attributes. Thirty different commercially available DSM process flavors were characterized both sensorily and chemically. For sensory evaluation, QDA (Quantitative Descriptive Analysis) was conducted with a trained savory panel (n=12) on 46 attributes in odor, flavor, and mouthfeel.

An untargeted sensomics approach was developed to cover the broadest possible range of chemical compound classes, combining four complementary analytical methods: NMR, GC-FID/MS (with oximation and silylation), SPME-GC-FID/MS, and LC-MS for general profiling of peptides up to about 15 amino acids. Sample preparation and method development were done for all four analytical methods. Using these methods, all process flavors were successfully characterized. Multivariate data analysis was applied to identify possible correlations between chemical and sensory data. Visualization tools are optimized, and detailed data mining is ongoing to translate findings into business-relevant answers. A holistic metabolic profiling approach was used to develop models describing flavor in process flavors.

#### P-517: Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) Offers Direct-from-Sample Mapping of Faecal Metabolites Without Sample Preparation
**Presenting Author:** Petra Paizs, Imperial College London, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** Alvaro Perdones-Montero, James Kinross, Simon Cameron, Zoltan Takats

**Abstract:**
Faecal metabolomics can provide a unique metabolic signature of intestinal function in a non-invasive manner and is crucial for identifying diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in gut-related diseases. This relies on the homogenous distribution of biomarkers within samples. Mass spectrometric imaging (MSI) is a key analytical tool for biomarker discovery, but most studies have focused on tissue analysis rather than faeces. Here, we present a high-throughput analysis pipeline using REIMS imaging, which allows near-real-time analysis and mapping of metabolites in whole fresh human faecal samples.

Our strategy enables in-depth analysis of the diversity and complexity of the faecal metabolome by visualizing the relative abundance and spatial distribution of metabolites. This pipeline has been optimized and validated as a high-throughput tool for direct-from-sample analysis with minimal sample preparation. Whole faecal samples (<1 hour post-bowel evacuation) were segmented into cross-sectional plates (5 mm) and analyzed at 1 mm resolution in negative and positive ionization modes. Data pre-processing and statistical analysis in R Studio (V1.0.44) allowed for targeted or untargeted analysis. Faeces from control patients with no known gastrointestinal disease were investigated, and a detailed analysis of key features was performed. In the fatty acid region, the most abundant peaks at m/z 255.25, 281.25, 279.25, 283.25, and 311.15 were distributed heterogeneously. We are now planning observational studies in colorectal cancer patients to investigate the spatial distribution of potential biomarkers. The mapping of metabolites through REIMS imaging demonstrates the first MSI technique for faecal sample analysis.

#### P-518: Impact of Instrument, Detection Method, and Statistical Methods in Mouse Plasma Metabolite Profiling
**Presenting Author:** Lukas Kucera, Czech Centre for Phenogenomics, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the ASCR, v.v.i., Prague, Czech Republic  
**Co-Authors:** Ashkan Zareie, Karel Chalupsky, Krystof Klima, Vendula Novosadova, Matthias Witt, Radislav Sedlacek

**Abstract:**
Changes in the metabolic profile of plasma reflect the metabolic state of an organism and may reveal disease biomarkers or depict the phenotype of an animal model. Fast and reliable methods for high throughput are needed for non-targeted screening of samples. This study compared plasma metabolite measurements among a group of wild-type and Klk8-deficient mice using four methods: C18 HPLC column attached to an LC-MS instrument (6550 iFunnel Q-TOF, Agilent), MRMS instrument (7T, scimaX, Bruker) coupled with an ESI source (FIA - direct infusion) or MALDI, and MALDI-TOF-MS instrument (rapifleX, Bruker). Ions in positive polarity mode were acquired. Results were analyzed using the Metaboanalyst statistical toolkit (Metaboanalyst 4.0, McGill University) and linear mixed-effects models (lme4 package, R language).

The number of peaks identified by each instrument, detection method, and the number of significant peaks were scored by different statistical models. In positive polarity, the MRMS instrument detected the highest number of peaks (6682 by FIA and 5246 by MALDI). For the FIA method, the Metaboanalyst toolkit found 366 peaks in positive mode, whereas mixed-effects model analyses reported 677 peaks. In conclusion, flow injection analysis (FIA) on the MRMS instrument followed by mixed-effect model analysis may serve the purpose of fast metabolite profiling of plasma.

#### P-519: rMSIcleanup: An Open-Source Computational Tool for Matrix-Related Peak Annotation in MALDI-MSI
**Presenting Author:** Gerard Baquer Gómez, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Gerard Baquer, Pere Ràfols, Maria Garcia-Altares, Maria Vinaixa, Xavier Correig

**Abstract:**
Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (LDI-MSI) is a label-free technology that provides spatially resolved molecular information from tissue sections. LDI-MSI has been broadly adopted in proteomics and peptidomics and is gaining attention in metabolomics as a novel tool to understand mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as cancer or diabetes. However, conventional organic matrices used in MALDI-MSI cause spectral interferences in the low m/z range, hampering metabolomics data processing. As an alternative, several matrix-free techniques, such as sputtered metal nanolayer deposition, have been used to reduce such interferences.

To expand LDI-MSI usage to metabolomics applications, we developed rMSIcleanup, an open-source R package to annotate exogenous signals related to the ionization source (organic matrix or metal layer) based on its chemical composition. The development version of rMSIcleanup is available at https://github.com/gbaquer/rMSIcleanup. As the first validation, rMSIcleanup was challenged using images acquired with a sputtered silver nanolayer. Silver clusters previously reported in literature were consistently identified, and chemically unfeasible cluster patterns showed lower similarity scores. A second validation step is in progress, aiming to replicate the results using MALDI-MSI images, including a dataset containing images acquired using the most common MALDI matrices and both TOF and FTICR spectrometers.

In conclusion, we have developed an open-source software tool that confidently annotates silver-related peaks in Ag-LDI-MS, anticipating its applicability to MALDI-MSI. Once demonstrated, rMSIcleanup will pave the way for the use of common organic matrices in metabolomics studies.

#### P-520: Discriminant Analysis and Feature Selection in Hyperspectral Imaging Using CORRS-CV
**Presenting Author:** Guillermo Quintas, Leitat Technological Center, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Juan Daniel Sanjuan, David Pérez-Guaita, Julia Kuligowski

**Abstract:**
Biomarker identification through hyperspectral imaging is gaining popularity in the clinical field. Hyperspectral imaging generates large, complex datasets that require high-throughput data processing and data mining for biological analysis. The application of multivariate discriminant analysis using bilinear models such as PLS-DA to hyperspectral images requires unfolding the spatial directions in a two-way matrix, resulting in a loss of spatial information and structure. During model development, internal validation methods such as random k-fold cross-validation (CV) are widely used. However, random selection of k subsets results in a loss of spatial structure and pixel-neighborhood information, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.

Using biological replicates to define k-fold CV splits provides the most accurate estimation of generalization performance but is inefficient when the number of replicates is scarce. Using simulated datasets and real IR and MS imaging data, we show the applicability of COnstrained Repeated Random Subsampling–Cross Validation (CORRS-CV). Results show that CORRS-CV avoids overly optimistic effects due to spectral oversampling in IR imaging. In situations where holding images back for testing is a waste of valuable information, CORRS-CV reduces the overly optimistic bias due to the use of test pixels close to the train set. Additionally, the combined use of CORRS-CV and rank products increases the robustness of the selection of candidate biomarkers.

#### P-521: Multi-metabolomics Strategy Sheds Light on Monoterpene Indole Alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus
**Presenting Author:** Ryo Nakabayashi, RIKEN CSRS, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Tetsuya Mori, Kei Hashimoto, Kiminori Toyooka, Yutaka Yamada, Hiroshi Tsugawa, Kazuki Saito

**Abstract:**
Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are important pharmaceutical resources in medicinal plants. For instance, 13.5% of Apocynaceae plants that produce MIAs are used for medicinal purposes worldwide. Exploring known and unknown MIAs in natural plant resources is worthwhile in metabolomics. Here, we established an approach for efficiently finding MIAs in Catharanthus roseus, a MIA-producing plant (Apocynaceae).

Metabolome data were acquired in an untargeted way using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in 15N (nitrogen)-labeled and non-labeled Catharanthus. Principal component analysis using the 15N- and non-labeled MS data in flowers, leaves, petioles, stems, and roots paired a set of non-labeled monoisotopic ion and 15N-labeled counterpart using retention time. Mass shift between the ions showed the number of N atoms in the monoisotopic ions. In MS/MS analysis, the mass shift of the product ion m/z 144.08 derived from the indolic skeleton was evaluated. Finally, the elemental composition of 45 MIAs was identified in the plant. Similarity analysis using MS/MS spectra showed the commonality or specificity in the spectra. Detailed MS/MS analysis identified a vintage MIA never found in Catharanthus, as well as known MIAs such as ajmalicine, catharanthine, perivine, and yohimbine. Combined analysis of microscopy and imaging mass spectrometry characterized the localization of the newly identified MIA, suggesting a function in a certain tissue. The metabolome data will be uploaded to the PlaSMA database (http://plasma.riken.jp/) at an appropriate time.

#### P-522: Discovery of New Cholesteryl Esters Using a Mathematical Model-Assisted UHPLC-MS/MS Method
**Presenting Author:** Jin-Lan Zhang, Institute of Materia Medica, CAMS & PUMC, China

**Abstract:**
Cholesteryl esters (CEs) are composed of the 3-hydroxyl group of cholesterol and a fatty acyl chain through an ester bond. Abnormal CE levels are often related to various diseases, particularly hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. A mathematical model-assisted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) method has been developed to profile CEs in plasma and different density lipoprotein samples from humans, rats, and golden hamsters.

81 CE candidates were detected in the above samples, of which 24 CEs were reported in the Human Metabolome Database and 57 CEs were newly identified based on a created database of theoretically possible CEs. Three mathematical models based on the characteristic chromatographic retention behavior related to structural features were established and validated using commercial and synthetic CE standards. The mathematical model-assisted UHPLC-MS/MS strategy was proposed to provide a global profile and identification of CEs. With this efficient strategy, 74 CEs in the plasma of golden hamsters were identified and then quantified in normal and hyperlipidemic golden hamsters by dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM). 21 CEs among 35 shared potential biomarkers were newly found for hyperlipidemia. Our study will contribute to the in-depth study of CE functions and the discovery of biomarkers for diseases.

#### P-524: Using Knime for the Analysis of LC-MS/MS Metabolic Datasets of Amitriptyline and Verapamil
**Presenting Author:** Nouf Alourfi, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, United Kingdom

**Abstract:**
A method for studying metabolic datasets has been developed using Knime (Konstanz Information Miner), a free and open-source data analytics, reporting, and visualization platform. Our aim is to address the growing variety and complexity of data in this field and thus contribute to improving the analysis process in general. We demonstrate our approach using datasets derived from an ESI-LC-MS/MS analysis of in vitro metabolites of amitriptyline and verapamil using liver microsomes.

Knime was used to create, treat, share, and store the raw ESI-LC-MS/MS data in a transparent and straightforward way. By using our approach, it was possible to automatically generate standard MS data visualizations. Moreover, we extended Knime by generating putative metabolites and MS/MS spectra of our drugs using computational applications such as SyGMa and CFM-ID. SyGMa consists of a set of reaction rules covering a broad range of phase 1 and 2 metabolism derived from metabolic reactions demonstrated in the metabolite database, which take place in humans. Next, we used a Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM-ID) to produce a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process and machine learning techniques to adapt the model parameters from data. This generated model can be used to predict the spectra for the chemical structure of given drugs and then compute the predicted spectrum for each candidate, comparing it to the input spectrum to rank the candidates according to how closely they match.

Using this workflow, we are able to assign structures to candidate metabolites within our samples.

#### P-525: Supporting Reproducibility in Metabolomics via a Data Analysis Reporting Template and the mzTab-M Data Standard
**Presenting Author:** Reza Salek, IARC, France  
**Co-Authors:** Considine EC, Salek R., N Hoffmann, J Rein, T Sachsenberg, J Hartler, K Haug, G Mayer, O Alka, S Dayalan, JTM Pearce, P Rocca-Serra, D Qi, M Eisenacher, Y Perez-Riverol, J Antonio Vizcaíno, RM. Salek, S Neumann, AR. Jones

**Abstract:**
A significant challenge in metabolomics is result reproducibility and confidence in metabolite identification, which are directly related to the choice of analytical instruments, available evidence extracted through data analysis, and quality of the reporting. Here, two approaches are presented to improve reproducibility and reporting in metabolite identification.

To enable comprehensive data analysis reporting, we present an R Markdown reporting template [1] that guides the production of text and generates workflow diagrams based on user input. This R Markdown template presents a set of minimum information requirements specifically for data pre-treatment and data analysis in biomarker discovery (https://github.com/MSI-Metabolomics-Standards-Initiative/MIDAS).

We also present mzTab-M, a data standard for sharing quantitative results in mass spectrometry metabolomics [2]. This standard was developed as a joint effort between the Metabolomics Standards Initiative and Proteomics Standards Initiative organizations over several years. mzTab-M is a simple tab-separated text format with highly standardized structures and a detailed specification document, tightly coupled to a validation software API, and mandatory controlled vocabulary terms to populate it. The format represents final quantification values from analyses, as well as the evidence trail in terms of features measured directly from MS (e.g., LC/GC-MS, DIMS, etc.) and the approaches used to identify molecules. It allows clear communication of identification ambiguity to readers and has widespread adoption potential. For details and implementations, see https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab.

Both approaches presented will facilitate more transparent and reproducible metabolomics. Citation and details: [1] Metabolites 2019, doi:10.3390/metabo9030043; [2] Anal Chem. 2019, doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04310.

#### P-526: L-Homocysteine Sulfinic Acid and Cysteic Acid as Novel Biomarkers of Acute Myocardial Infarction
**Presenting Author:** Youngja Park, Korea University, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Adnan Khan

**Abstract:**
Identifying changes in serum metabolites before the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an important approach for finding novel biomarkers of AMI. In this retrospective cohort study, serum samples obtained from patients at risk of AMI (n = 112) and non-risk controls (n = 89) were tested using high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) coupled with LC-MS/MS. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), along with univariate analysis using false discovery rate (FDR) at q = 0.05, were performed to discriminate metabolic profiles and determine significantly different metabolites between healthy controls and AMI risk groups.

PLS-DA significantly separated the AMI risk sera from healthy controls. Altered metabolic pathways analysis in the KEGG online database showed that biosynthesis of amino acids, 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were mainly altered in AMI risk sera. The metabolites associated with these pathways were mainly elevated among AMI patients. Further validation and quantifications by MS/MS showed that carnitine, L-homocysteine sulfinic acid (L-HCSA), and cysteic acid (CA) were upregulated, while L-cysteine and L-cysteine sulfinic acid (L-CSA) were downregulated, specifically among AMI risk sera. Additionally, these discriminant metabolic profiles and phenotypes among AMI were not related to other factors such as hypertension, smoking, or alcoholism.

In conclusion, our study suggests that the detection of upregulated L-HCSA and CA, along with carnitine among AMI risk patients, could serve as promising non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of AMI.

#### P-527: Establishing a Spectral Library and Accurate Mass Retention Time (AMRT) Database for Neonatal Metabolomics Analysis
**Presenting Author:** Anas Kamleh, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Chiara Lavarello, Sebastiano Barco, Igor Fochi, Martina Batolucci, Gino Tripodi, Giuliana Cangemi, Andrea Petretto

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics is an established discovery tool for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and novel mechanistic insights into pathophysiological processes. Liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is currently the method of choice for metabolome analysis. However, the wide variety of chromatographic columns and conditions presents a challenge in sharing and interpreting metabolite identities. The Metabolic Standard Initiative (MSI) guidelines require identification of metabolites to be based on matching accurate mass, retention time, and fragmentation spectra to those from authentic standards.

To facilitate sharing of information between groups involved in neonatal metabolomics analysis, we have established a spectral library of compounds in the commercial product (IROA) metabolite identification. Data in the spectral library was acquired using flow injection analysis (FIA), which allowed the fast acquisition of spectra at a wide range of collision energies (0-120, normalized collision energy NCE). Additionally, a separate library with optimized collision energy was constructed by applying rules of maximal selectivity and structural information. The latter library is the basis for further confirmation of the identity of compounds in future studies.

Furthermore, we provide a scheme for obtaining the minimum number of metabolite mixtures that provide full coverage of the IROA kit. These mixtures were used to establish an accurate mass/retention time (AMRT) database using six different chromatographic columns (three reversed-phase and three HILIC) and chromatographic suitability criteria were applied to select the most appropriate methods. Metabolite identification in matrices (plasma, urine, and sweat) was further validated using the established AMRT databases and libraries.

#### P-528: Metabolite Identification from LC-MS/MS Spectra Using Deep Learning
**Presenting Author:** Svetlana Kutuzova, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark  
**Co-Authors:** Douglas McCloskey, Christian Igel

**Abstract:**
Mass spectrometry is a powerful high-throughput technology for chemical composition assessment. However, the data processing of the resulting spectra is a major bottleneck for large studies, particularly the metabolite identification from the mass spectra. The joint community effort of collecting and maintaining metabolomics spectral databases provides the opportunity to approach the metabolite identification problem with powerful but data-hungry algorithms, including deep learning.

We present a novel deep learning-based algorithm for compound identification that makes a prediction of a structural chemical fingerprint based on an LC-MS/MS spectrum of a compound. Both raw spectra and fragmentation trees predicted by SIRIUS software are used as input. A Tree-LSTM network is used to process the fragmentation trees alongside a feed-forward neural network that captures patterns in the spectral data. Our method is validated on the CASMI 2017 challenge dataset. While the method does not yet outperform the state-of-the-art approach, it is shown to be a proof of concept and a solid base for future developments. Future work would include learning fragmentation rules from the spectrum itself, enabling a complete end-to-end spectrum analysis.

#### P-529: Prediction Models of Retention Indices: Application to Gas Chromatography Coupled with High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry for Two Column Types: DB-624 and HP-5ms
**Presenting Author:** Adrian Haiduc, PMI, Switzerland  
**Co-Authors:** E. Dossin, P. Diana, P.A. Guy, N.V. Ivanov, M. Peitsch

**Abstract:**
Monitoring of volatile and semi-volatile compounds was performed using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to high-resolution electron ionization mass spectrometry, using both headspace and liquid injection modes on DB-624 and HP-5ms columns. A total of 1,300 reference compounds (n=400 analyzed on HP-5ms and n=900 on DB-624 columns), including n-alkanes (covering C5 to C30) as reference index markers, were analyzed, and experimental linear retention indices (LRI) were determined. These reference compounds were randomly split into training and validation sets.

LRI for all 1,300 reference compounds were predicted based upon computational Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) models using calculated 2D descriptors and multiple approaches: PLS, Lasso regression, stepwise MLR, Genetic Evolution Algorithm predictor selection, and Neural Networks. PLS and Lasso provided the fastest calculation and most accurate prediction level. Correlation coefficients for experimental versus predicted LRI values were calculated at 0.96 for DB-624 and 0.98 for HP-5ms for the training sets and at 0.94 and 0.95 for the validation sets, respectively. These models were then used to predict LRI values for several thousand reported metabolite compounds. The predicted LRI values can be used for column type selection and increased confidence level in unknown identification by means of the Mahalanobis distance.
