### Tracking by Online Services

#### Popular vs. Non-Popular Online Services

We analyzed how tracking correlates with the popularity of online services, using Alexa's top 1 million domains as a reference. We found that out of the 210,373 sender domains, 18,461 domains are within Alexa's top 1 million, and 2,052 are within the top 10K. For our analysis, we treated the Alexa top 10K as popular domains and the rest as non-popular domains. 

- **Popular Domains (Alexa top 10K):**
  - Contributed 15.9% of the total emails.
  - About 50% adopted tracking in their emails.
  - More likely to use first-party tracking and stealthy tracking methods.

- **Non-Popular Domains:**
  - Less than 10% adopted email tracking.
  - Less likely to use stealthy tracking methods.

#### Type of Online Services

In Figure 12, we focused on the top 10 categories of sender domains and analyzed the ratio of those that adopted email tracking. Not surprisingly, marketing services have the highest ratio of tracking. Many marketing services themselves are email tracking services.

### Observations

- Top trackers under different tracking methods rarely overlap, indicating that trackers usually stick to a specific method.
- Google's trackers (google-analytics.com and doubleclick.net) are among the top 10 in invisible remote tracking.
- In the email tracking market, Google is not as dominant as it is in web tracking, where it can track users across nearly 80% of the top 1 million sites.
- Popular domains are more likely to use stealthy tracking methods, such as invisible remote pixels and hidden trackers, compared to non-popular domains.
