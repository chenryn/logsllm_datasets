“other tracking”. Figure 6 shows that third-party trackers are
less likely to collect the user email address as the identiﬁer.
Figure 7 shows the number of third-party trackers used
by each sender domain (corresponding to an online service).
We ﬁnd that the vast majority (83%) of online services use
a single third-party tracker. About 17% of online services
have multiple third-party trackers, sharing user information
with multiple-parties at the same time. The extreme case is
amazonses.com which uses 61 third-party trackers.
Top Trackers.
From the third-party tracker’s perspective,
Figure 8 shows that only a small number of trackers are
used broadly by different online services. To analyze the top
trackers, we present Table IX to list top third-party trackers
for each tracking method. We rank the trackers based on the
number of online services that use them. A popular tracker
should be used by many online services. For reference, we
also show the number of emails associated with each tracker.
We observe that top trackers under different tracking meth-
ods rarely overlap with each other. This indicates that a
tracker usually sticks to a speciﬁc tracking method. The
most dominating trackers per category are mczany.com
(plaintext
tracking), alcmpn.com (obfuscated tracking),
list-manage.com (invisible HTML), and hubspot.com
(invisible remote). Noticeably, under the “stealthy” remote
tracking, we also ﬁnd that google-analytics.com and
doubleclick.net make the top 10, which are Google’s
trackers that have dominated web tracking [48], [9], [29].
Table X shows the top trackers across the full dataset,
including all the hidden trackers. We show that the top 10
trackers collectively cover 33.5% of online services, and are
responsible for 12% of the tracking emails. Although top
trackers are taking a big share of the market, they are not
as dominating as the top tracker (i.e. Google) in web tracking.
For example, previous measurements show that Google can
track users across nearly 80% of the top 1 million sites [31].
Clearly, in the email tracking market, Google is not yet as
dominating as it is in the web tracking.
C. Tracking by Online Services
Finally, we analyze different online services and seek to
understand whether the popularity of online services and the
service type would correlate to different tracking behaviors.
Popular vs. non-Popular Online Services.
We ﬁrst
examine how tracking correlates with the popularity of online
services. We reference Alexa’s top 1 million domains for the
ranking [2]. Note that Alexa’s ranking is primarily applied
to the web domain instead of the email domain. Accordingly,
we check the MX record of Alexa top 1 million domains to
perform the match. We ﬁnd that out of the 210,373 sender
domains, 18,461 domains are within Alexa top 1 million, and
2,052 are within the Alexa top 10K. For our analysis, we treat
the Alexa top 10K as the popular domains, and the rest as
non-popular domains. In total, the small portion of popular
domains (0.98%) contributed 15.9% of the total emails.
Figure 9 shows that tracking is much more prevalent among
popular domains. About 50% of popular domains adopted
tracking in their emails. As a comparison, less than 10% of
non-popular domains have adopted email tracking. Regarding
different tracking methods, plaintext tracking and obfuscated
tracking are not as prevalent as invisible pixel tracking, which
is true for both popular and non-popular domains. Figure 10
shows that popular domains are slightly more likely to have
ﬁrst-party tracking than third-party tracking. Figure 11 shows
that popular domains are more likely to use tracking methods
that are harder to detect. More speciﬁcally, we focus on two
types of stealthy tracking including: invisible remote pixels
(where the HTML tags falsely claim the image size) and
hidden trackers (trackers hide behind redirection). We observe
a big difference: about 12% – 16% of popular domains have
used stealthy tracking and only 1% of non-popular domains
use such tracking methods.
Type of Online Services.
In Figure 12, we focus on the top
10 categories of sender domains and analyze the ratio of them
that adopted email tracking. Not too surprisingly, “marketing”
