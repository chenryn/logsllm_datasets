It seems like you are encountering a version compatibility issue with the TypeScript compiler (tsc). The errors you're seeing in `node.d.ts` indicate that there might be a syntax problem, which could be related to the tsc version you are using. Below is a more detailed and structured version of your message:

I am unsure which version of `tsc` you support, and this might be a version-related problem. Here are the details of the error I encountered:

**File: `error.ts`**

```sh
$ tsc error.ts
```

**Errors:**
- `node.d.ts(101,36): error TS1005: ';' expected.`
- `node.d.ts(690,23): error TS1005: ';' expected.`
- `node.d.ts(702,23): error TS1005: ';' expected.`
- `node.d.ts(1228,36): error TS1005: ';' expected.`

**TypeScript Compiler Version:**
```sh
$ tsc -v
Version 1.0.3.0
```

Could you please confirm the supported version of `tsc` and any specific configuration requirements?
