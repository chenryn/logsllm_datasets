  * matplotlib 1.5.1, python 3.4.4, win8.1, seaborn 0.7.0
  * anaconda installation
  * EPS produced while using the `seaborn` package are empty in my win 8.1 environment. I went through `seaborn`'s rcmod.py and figured that setting `"font.sans-serif": ["Arial", "Liberation Sans", "Bitstream Vera Sans", "sans-serif"]` causes the problem, which itself calls `matplotlib.rcParams.update()`. PNG, JPG etc. work without problem. It also runs without problems on my UX system.
  * Cannot say it has worked before, as I only recently started to use seaborn
