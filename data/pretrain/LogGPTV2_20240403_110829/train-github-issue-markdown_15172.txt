Hi, I am currently using sublime text with the Origami plugin which allows
easily to split/unsplit and move between panes with keyboard shortcuts, some
of the features are already available in the last Atom with I am missing some:
Already possible:
  * split left/right/top/bottom
Not possible as far as I can tell:
  * move to left/right/top/bottom
  * unsplit left/right/top/bottom (the associated pane tabs will get merged into the current pane)
  * move active tab to pane left/right/top/bottom
