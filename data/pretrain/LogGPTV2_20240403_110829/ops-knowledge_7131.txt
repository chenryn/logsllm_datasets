User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Installing Ubuntu guest crashes Hyper-V host I have a weird problem that I don't even know where to begin diagnosing.  Trying to install Ubuntu to a VM locks up the host system!

My setup is:


Dell R715 server, dual 16 core AMD opteron processors, 96GB RAM
Dell MD3600f SAN
Server 2008 R2 Datacenter
System Center VMM 2012


There are 5 windows virtual machines running that have had no problems.  This is the first linux VM I've tried to create.  I setup a VM through virtual machine manager, set the CD drive to a Ubuntu 12.04 server x64 iso, and started it up.

It boots up the normal ubuntu install menu, but the second I hit enter on "Install Ubuntu Server", I get disconnected.

The HOST machine stops responding to pings.  So do all virtual machines on it.  It locks up entirely - keyboard on the host won't work, mouse won't move, numlock light won't change.

There's no blue screen - the host is sitting at the login screen completely unresponsive.  I can't find any relevant logs in event viewer after rebooting.

What could cause the host machine to freeze like that?

It's not a one time occurrence - it happens every time at the exact same point.  Thank god this server isn't in production yet!

Update:

It doesn't seem to be a hardware problem.  I fired up a dozen extra virtual machines to see if I was maybe hitting a bad spot of RAM, but everything worked fine.

Ubuntu 10.04 installed with no issues.

When doing a do-release-upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04, it got part way through the upgrade before it threw the root filesystem into read only mode and started getting tons of IO errors.  Not a disk issue since I was able to run hard drive benchmarks and read/write large files before I started the upgrade.

Next things to test are 12.04 alternate CD, and 12.04 32bit and see if they show the same behavior.

Update 2

Well now this is fun...it was consistently freezing on Thursday and Friday, at least 20 times in the same spot.  Nothing changed over the weekend.  I'm the only one who has access to the server at the moment.  And today I can boot that ISO just fine without any crashes.

I hate problems that go away on their own.  I was hoping to narrow it down so I could at least know what not to do when it goes into production.
