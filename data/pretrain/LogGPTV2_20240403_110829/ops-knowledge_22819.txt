User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to remove device from safe list? This morning I logged to gmail from a strange computer. Google recognizes this and goes through three-factor autentication to check it's really myself.

Now I can go to my account from my habitual computer and tell google it was really really myself, or I can tell it it was not myself. 

I want to tell google that it was me, but that it should check again the next time someone tries to connect from that computer (3FA and everything).

Is this possible?

Assistant: First remove access to your account for that device


Now log back in to your Google account. When it asks to not ask for 3FA again for a month, select no. 
And now you can go back to your security settings and tell Google that the device is you.
