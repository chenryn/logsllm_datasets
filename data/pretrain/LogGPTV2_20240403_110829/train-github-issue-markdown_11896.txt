I install matplotlib on OS X using a Gentoo prefix install. Everything seems
to work ok. The only problem I've encountered so far is that when I try to
save something to a file, I can't change the filename on the dialog box,
because the keyboard strokes go to the terminal where I am running python. I
don't know if this is a matplotlib issue or a issue in tkinter from Python,
but matplotlib is the only place where I have this problem.
