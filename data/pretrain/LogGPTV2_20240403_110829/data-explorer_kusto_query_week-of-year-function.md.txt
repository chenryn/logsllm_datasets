# week_of_year()

Returns an integer representing the week number, calculated from the first week of the year, which includes the first Thursday, according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates).

**Deprecated aliases:** `weekofyear()`

> [!NOTE]
> The deprecated `weekofyear()` function was not ISO 8601 compliant. It defined the first week of the year as the one containing the first Wednesday.

## Syntax

```plaintext
week_of_year(date)
```

[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]

## Parameters

| Name   | Type      | Required | Description |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| *date* | `datetime`| Yes      | The date for which to return the week of the year. |

## Returns

- **Return type:** Integer
- **Description:** The week number that contains the given date.

## Examples

| Input                                    | Output |
|-----------------------------------------|--------|
| `week_of_year(datetime(2020-12-31))`     | `53`   |
| `week_of_year(datetime(2020-06-15))`     | `25`   |
| `week_of_year(datetime(1970-01-01))`     | `1`    |
| `week_of_year(datetime(2000-01-01))`     | `52`   |

> [!NOTE]
> The `weekofyear()` function is an obsolete variant of `week_of_year()`. It was not ISO 8601 compliant, defining the first week of the year as the one containing the first Wednesday. The current `week_of_year()` function adheres to ISO 8601, where the first week of the year is the one with the first Thursday.
