This seemed to have started recently, but I'm not sure which version of
electron exactly. I've reproduced it on 0.36.4 and 0.36.5.
When sending an object over ipc from the main process, additional references
to the same object end up being null. The first 'instance' of that property on
`state` makes it to the client, but any additional references end up null.
      const state = {}
      const object = { 'prop': 1 }
      state.firstReference = object
      state.brokenReference = object // brokenReference ends up null on the client
      win.webContents.on('did-finish-load', function() {
        console.log('sending state', state)
        win.webContents.send('update', state)
      });
Here's a repo that reproduces this:
