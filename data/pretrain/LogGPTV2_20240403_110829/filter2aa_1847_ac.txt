### Managing DNS Records and Zones in Mac OS X Server

#### 1. Creating A Records
Every device with a static IP address (e.g., printers, file servers) that requires a name should have an A record. When creating an A record, you can optionally specify the creation of a reverse lookup record and its corresponding zone. For detailed instructions, refer to "Managing Records" on page 25.

#### 2. Setting Up MX Records (Optional)
If your server provides email services over the Internet, you need to set up an MX record. For more information, see "Setting Up MX Records" on page 33.

#### 3. Configuring Reverse Lookup Zones (Optional)
For each zone you create, Mac OS X Server automatically generates a reverse lookup zone. These zones translate IP addresses into domain names, as opposed to the standard lookups that convert domain names into IP addresses. If you did not specify reverse lookup records during the initial A record creation, you may need to configure the reverse lookup zone afterward.

#### 4. Starting DNS Service
Mac OS X Server includes a straightforward interface for starting and stopping DNS service. For more details, see "Starting and Stopping DNS Service" on page 21.

### Managing DNS Service

#### Overview
Mac OS X Server provides a simple interface for managing DNS service, including starting and stopping the service, viewing logs, and monitoring status. Basic DNS settings can be configured using Server Admin, while advanced features require configuring BIND from the command line, which is not covered here.

#### Starting and Stopping DNS Service
To start or stop DNS service:
1. In Server Admin, select DNS from the Computers & Services list.
2. Ensure at least one zone and its reverse lookup zone are created and fully configured.
3. Click Start Service or Stop Service.
   - The service may take a moment to start or stop.

#### Enabling or Disabling Zone Transfers
Zone data is replicated among authoritative DNS servers through zone transfers. Secondary DNS servers (slaves) use these transfers to acquire data from primary DNS servers (masters). To enable or disable zone transfers:
1. In Server Admin, select DNS from the Computer & Services list.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the General tab.
4. Check or uncheck Allow Zone Transfers as needed.

#### Enabling or Disabling Recursion
Recursion is the process of fully resolving domain names into IP addresses. Disabling recursion can prevent malicious users from altering master zone records (cache poisoning) or unauthorized use of the server for DNS service. However, disabling it will prevent your users from using the DNS service to look up names outside your zones.
To enable or disable recursion:
1. In Server Admin, select DNS from the Computer & Services list.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the General tab.
4. Check or uncheck Allow Recursion as needed.
   - Consider disabling recursion for external IP addresses but enabling it for LAN IP addresses by editing BIND's `named.conf` file. Refer to BIND's documentation for more information.

### Managing Zones

#### Types of Zones
- **Master Zone**: Contains the master copy of the zone’s records and provides authoritative answers to lookup requests.
- **Slave Zone**: A copy of a master zone stored on a secondary name server. Slaves use zone transfers to get copies of the master zone data.
- **Forward Zone**: Directs all lookup requests for that zone to other DNS servers.

#### Adding a Master Zone

6. Choose Master from the Zone Type pop-up menu.
7. Enter the hostname of the domain’s SOA (e.g., "ns.example.com.").
8. Enter the email address of the zone’s administrator (e.g., "admin.example.com.").

### Securing the DNS Server

DNS servers are often targeted by malicious users. Common attacks include:
- **DNS Spoofing**: Adding false data into the DNS server’s cache.
- **Server Mining**: Extracting sensitive information from the server.
- **DNS Service Profiling**: Gathering information about the DNS service configuration.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Overloading the server with traffic.
- **Service Piggybacking**: Using the DNS service for unauthorized purposes.

#### DNS Spoofing
DNS spoofing allows hackers to:
- Redirect domain name queries to alternative IP addresses.
- Prevent proper domain name resolution and access to the Internet.

By taking extra precautions, such as securing the DNS server and regularly monitoring logs, you can mitigate these risks.
