### Integrating Twig Sandbox with Symfony's Twig Bundles

**Introduction:**
This document aims to provide guidance on integrating the Twig sandbox extension with Symfony's Twig bundles. The primary challenge is the lack of comprehensive documentation, both for the sandbox itself and its integration with Symfony. Given the sandbox's potential, it deserves more attention, ideally including an article in the Symfony documentation.

**Evaluation and Integration:**
During the evaluation of the sandbox extension and its integration, several questions arose that would benefit from the insights of the original designers:

1. **Environment Configuration:**
   - **Single vs. Multiple Environments:**
     - **Question:** Should a new Twig environment be created for each sandbox "profile"?
     - **If Yes:** How can the default Twig environment, complete with its integrated features (e.g., profiler, loaders, forms), be duplicated without significant effort?
     - **If No:** What is the recommended approach to enable different sandbox "profiles"? Could this be a feature request for the Twig project itself?

2. **Policy Configuration:**
   - **Question:** How can policies (or multiple policies) be set up via configuration?
   - **Suggestion:** A configuration method similar to the one provided by `intaro/twig-sandbox-bundle` could be a good starting point. However, this bundle is not up-to-date and has some design flaws that need to be addressed.

3. **User-Supplied Templates:**
   - **Question:** How should user-supplied templates be validated and linted?
   - **Current Tools:**
     - Twig provides a lint command and documentation on validating Twig syntax.
     - There are also blog entries on creating validators for this purpose.
   - **Suggestion:** Similar to the lint command, a validator for user-supplied templates should be included in the Twig bundle. This would ensure consistency and ease of use.

**Conclusion:**
Integrating the Twig sandbox with Symfony's Twig bundles can significantly enhance security and control over user-supplied templates. However, the process requires clear documentation and possibly additional features in the Twig project. By addressing the questions and suggestions outlined above, we can improve the overall experience and make the sandbox a more robust and widely adopted feature.

**Next Steps:**
- Consider contributing to the Symfony and Twig documentation to include detailed instructions on sandbox integration.
- Evaluate and potentially update or replace existing third-party bundles like `intaro/twig-sandbox-bundle`.
- Propose and implement necessary features in the Twig project to support multiple sandbox profiles and policy configurations.
