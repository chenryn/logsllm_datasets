This is about how to properly integrate twig sandbox with the twig-bundles
configuration.
The major problem with this is, that there is very limited documentation
available about the sandbox itself and none regarding the integration with
symfony. I think the sandbox is a very nice feature and should get some more
love (at least an article in the symfony docs).
When i was evaluating the sandbox extension and how to integrate it, there are
a few questions that came up, that would be best answered by the "designers
intent":
  * Should there be a new twig env for each sandbox "profile"?  
-> If yes, how to duplicate the default twig environment with all its integrated features (profiler, loaders, forms etc) without too much pain?  
-> If no, how to enable different sandbox "profiles"? Could this be a feature request against twig itself?
  * A way to setup the policy (or multiple policies) by configuration (similar to https://github.com/intaro/twig-sandbox-bundle which is a good start, but isnt up to date and has its design flaws)
  * If using the sandbox, the feature to be implemented is dealing with user supplied templates most of the time. There is a twig lint command and an article in the twig docs on how to validate the twig syntax. there are also some blog entries on how to create a validator for this. imho this should be included in the twig bundle just as the lint command is.
