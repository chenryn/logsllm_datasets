Subject: Assistance Needed with VTKLoader in Three.js

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently working on a project that involves loading VTK files, generated by ParaView, into a web application using Three.js and the VTKLoader. Unfortunately, I have encountered an issue where the VTKLoader does not successfully render the data; instead, it fails silently without displaying any errors or warnings in the console.

Could you kindly provide some guidance or suggestions on how to troubleshoot this problem? I would greatly appreciate any advice or pointers on resolving this issue.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
