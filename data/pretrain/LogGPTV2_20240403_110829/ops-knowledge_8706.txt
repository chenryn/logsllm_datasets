**Question:**
Is there a way to send an HTTP request from Google App Engine without waiting for a response? I want to push data via HTTP without incurring the latency of waiting for a response.

**Answer:**
Yes, you can achieve this by using the `URLFetch` service with a very low timeout value. This will allow the request to be sent without waiting for the response, effectively making it a "fire and forget" operation. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Set the `deadline` parameter to a very low value, such as 0.1 seconds (100ms). This ensures that the request times out quickly, allowing your application to continue without waiting for the response.
2. Wrap the `URLFetch` call in a `try/catch` block to handle the expected timeout exception.

Here is a sample code snippet to illustrate this approach:

```python
from google.appengine.api import urlfetch

def send_async_request(url, payload):
    try:
        # Send the request with a very low deadline
        result = urlfetch.fetch(
            url=url,
            payload=payload,
            method=urlfetch.POST,
            headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
            deadline=0.1  # 100ms
        )
    except urlfetch.DeadlineExceededError:
        # Handle the timeout, which is expected
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle other potential exceptions
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
url = "https://example.com/api/endpoint"
payload = '{"key": "value"}'
send_async_request(url, payload)
```

In this example, the `send_async_request` function sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL with the given payload. The `deadline` parameter is set to 0.1 seconds, and any `DeadlineExceededError` is caught and handled, allowing the function to continue executing without waiting for the response.
