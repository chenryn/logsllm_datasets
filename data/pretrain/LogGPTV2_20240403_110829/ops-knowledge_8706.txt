User: Does anybody know how to make http request from Google App Engine without waiting a response?
It should be like a push data with http without latency for response.
Assistant: I've done this before by setting doing a URLFetch and setting a very low value for the deadline parameter. I put 0.1 as my value, so 100ms. You need to wrap the URLFetch in a try/catch also since the request will timeout.
