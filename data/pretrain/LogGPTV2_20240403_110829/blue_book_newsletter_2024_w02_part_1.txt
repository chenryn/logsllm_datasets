### [Life review](life_review.md)
* New: [Thoughts on the reviews themselves.](life_review.md#thoughts-on-the-reviews-themselves)
    - Keep It Simple: It's important for the process to be light enough that you want to actually do it, so you see it as a help instead of a burden. It's always better to do a small and quick review rather than nothing at all. At the start of the review analyze yourself to assess how much energy do you have and decide which steps of the review you want to do.
    - Review approaches: In the past I used the [life logging](life_logging.md) tools to analyze the past in order to understand what I achieved and take it as a base to learn from my mistakes. It was useful when I needed the endorphines boost of seeing all the progress done. Once I assumed that progress speed and understood that we always do the best we can given how we are, I started to feel that the review process was too cumbersome and that it was holding me into the past.
      Nowadays I try not to look back but forward, analyze the present: how I feel, how's the environment around me, and how can I tweak both to fulfill my life goals. This approach leads to less reviewing of achievements and logs and more introspection, thinking and imagining. Which although may be slower to correct mistakes of the past, will surely make you live closer to the utopy.
      The reviews below then follow that second approach.
    - Personal alive reviews: Reviews have to reflect ourselves, and we change continuously, so take for granted that your review is going to change.
      I've gone for full blown reviews of locking myself up for a week to not doing reviews for months.
      This article represent the guidelines I follow to do my life review. It may
      seem a lot to you or may be very simple. Please take it as a base or maybe to
      get some ideas and then create your own that fits your needs.
* New: [Update the Month review process.](life_review.md#month-review-tools)
* New: [When to do the trimester reviews.](life_review.md#when-to-do-the-trimester-reviews)
    As with [moth reviews](life_review.md#month-review), it's interesting to do analysis at representative moments. It gives it an emotional weight. You can for example use the solstices or my personal version of the solstices:
    - Spring analysis (1st of March): For me the spring is the real start of the year, it's when life explodes after the stillness of the winter. The sun starts to set later enough so that you have light in the afternoons, the climate gets warmer thus inviting you to be more outside, the nature is blooming new leaves and flowers. It is then a moment to build new projects and set the current year on track.
    - Summer analysis (1st of June): I hate heat, so summer is a moment of retreat. Everyone temporarily stop their lives, we go on holidays and all social projects slow their pace. Even the news have even less interesting things to report. It's so hot outside that some of us seek the cold refuge of home or remote holiday places. Days are long and people love to hang out till late, so usually you wake up later, thus having less time to actually do stuff. Even in the moments when you are alone the heat drains your energy to be productive. It is then a moment to relax and gather forces for the next trimester. It's also perfect to develop *easy* and *chill* personal projects that have been forgotten in a drawer. Lower your expectations and just flow with what your body asks you.
    - Autumn analysis (1st of September): September it's another key moment for many people. We have it hardcoded in our life since we were children as it was the start of school. People feel energized after the summer holidays and are eager to get back to their lives and stopped projects. You're already 6 months into the year, so it's a good moment to review your year plan and decide how you want to invest your energy reserves.
    - Winter analysis (1st of December): December is the cue that the year is coming to an end. The days grow shorter and colder, they basically invite you to enjoy a cup of tea under a blanket. It is then a good time to get into your cave and do an introspection analysis on the whole year and prepare the ground for the coming year. Some of the goals of this season are:
      - Think everything you need to guarantee a good, solid and powerful spring start.
      - Do the year review to adjust your principles.
    The year is then divided in two sets of an expansion trimester and a retreat one. We can use this information to adjust our life plan accordingly. In the expansion trimester we could invest more energies in the planning, and in the retreat ones we can do more throughout reviews.
* New: [The principle documents.](life_review.md#the-principle-documents)
    Principle documents for me are [orgmode](orgmode.md) documents where I think about the principle itself. It acts both as a way of understanding it and evolving my idea around it, and to build the roadmap to materialize the principle's path.
    Without ever having created one I feel that it makes sense to make the reflection part public in the blue book, while I keep for myself the private one. This may also change between principles.
* New: [The life path document.](life_review.md#the-life-path-document)
    The life path document is an [orgmode](orgmode.md) document where I think about what I want to do with my life and how. It's the highest level of abstraction of the life management system.
    The structure so far is as follows:
    ```orgmode
    * Life path
    ** {year}
    *** Principles of {season} {year}
        {Notes on the season}
        - Principle 1
        - Principle 2
        ...
    **** Objectives of {month} {year}
         - [-] Objective 1
           - [X] SubObjective 1
           - [ ] SubObjective 2
         - [ ] Objective 2
         - [ ] ...
    ```
    Where the principles are usually links to principle documents and the objectives links to tasks.
* New: [Trimester prepare.](life_review.md#trimester-prepare)
    The trimester review requires an analysis that doesn't fill in a day session. It requires slow thinking over some time. So I'm creating a task 10 days before the actual review to start thinking about the next trimester. Whether it's ideas, plans, desires, objectives, or principles.
    Is useful for that document to be available wherever you go, so that in any spare time you can pop it up and continue with the train of thought.
    Doing the reflection without seeing your life path prevents you from being tainted by it, thus representing the real you of right now.
    On the day to actually do the review, follow the steps of the [Month review prepare](life_review.md#month-prepare) adjusting them to the trimester case.
## Task Management
### [Org Mode](orgmode.md)
* New: [Start working on a task dates.](orgmode.md#start-working-on-a-task-dates)
    `SCHEDULED` defines when you are plan to start working on that task.
    The headline is listed under the given date. In addition, a reminder that the scheduled date has passed is present in the compilation for today, until the entry is marked as done or [disabled](#how-to-deal-with-overdue-SCHEDULED-and-DEADLINE-tasks).
    ```org
    *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
        SCHEDULED: 
    ```
    Although is not a good idea (as it promotes the can pushing through the street), if you want to delay the display of this task in the agenda, use `SCHEDULED: ` the task is still scheduled on the 25th but will appear two days later. In case the task contains a repeater, the delay is considered to affect all occurrences; if you want the delay to only affect the first scheduled occurrence of the task, use `--2d` instead.
    Scheduling an item in Org mode should not be understood in the same way that we understand scheduling a meeting. Setting a date for a meeting is just [a simple appointment](#appointments), you should mark this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown on the date where it applies. This is a frequent misunderstanding by Org users. In Org mode, scheduling means setting a date when you want to start working on an action item.
    You can set it with `s` (Default: `ois`)
* New: [Deadlines.](orgmode.md#deadlines)
    `DEADLINE` are like [appointments](#appointments) in the sense that it defines when the task is supposed to be finished on. On the deadline date, the task is listed in the agenda. The difference with appointments is that you also see the task in your agenda if it is overdue and you can set a warning about the approaching deadline, starting `org_deadline_warning_days` before the due date (14 by default). It's useful then to set `DEADLINE` for those tasks that you don't want to miss that the deadline is over.
    An example:
    ```org
    * TODO Do this
    DEADLINE: 
    ```
    You can set it with `d` (Default: `oid`).
    If you need a different warning period for a special task, you can specify it. For example setting a warning period of 5 days `DEADLINE: `.
    If you're as me, you may want to remove the warning feature of `DEADLINES` to be able to keep your agenda clean. Most of times you are able to finish the task in the day, and for those that you can't specify a `SCHEDULED` date. To do so set the default number of days to `0`.
    ```lua
    require('orgmode').setup({
      org_deadline_warning_days = 0,
    })
    ```
    Using too many tasks with a `DEADLINE` will clutter your agenda. Use it only for the actions that you need to have a reminder, instead try to using [appointment](#appointments) dates instead. The problem of using appointments is that once the date is over you don't get a reminder in the agenda that it's overdue, if you need this, use `DEADLINE` instead.
* New: [How to deal with overdue SCHEDULED and DEADLINE tasks.](orgmode.md#how-to-deal-with-overdue-scheduled-and-deadline-tasks.)
## Knowledge Management
### [Anki](anki.md)
* New: [What to do when you need to edit a card but don't have the time.](anki.md#what-to-do-when-you-need-to-edit-a-card-but-don't-have-the-time)
    You can mark it with a red flag so that you remember to edit it the next time you see it.
## [Grocy Management](grocy_management.md)
* New: [Doing the inventory review.](grocy_management.md#doing-the-inventory-review)
    I haven't found a way to make the grocy inventory match the reality because for me it's hard to register when I consume a product. Even more if other people also use them. Therefore I use grocy only to know what to buy without thinking about it. For that use case the inventory needs to meet reality only before doing the groceries. I usually do a big shopping of non-perishable goods at the supermarket once each two or three months, and a weekly shopping of the rest.
    Tracking the goods that are bought each week makes no sense as those are things that are clearly seen and are very variable depending on the season. Once I've automated the ingestion and consumption of products it will, but so far it would mean investing more time than the benefit it gives.
    This doesn't apply to the big shopping, as this one is done infrequently, so we need a better planning.
    To do the inventory review I use a tablet and the [android app](https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android).
    - [ ] Open the stock overview and iterate through the locations to:
      - [ ] Make sure that the number of products match the reality
        - [ ] Iterate over the list of products checking the quantity
        - [ ] Look at the location to see if there are missing products in the inventory
      - [ ] Adjust the product properties (default location, minimum amount)
    - [ ] Check the resulting shopping list and adjust the minimum values.
    - [ ] Check the list of missing products to adjust the minimum values. I have a notepad in the fridge where I write the things I miss.
# Coding
## Languages
### [Bash snippets](bash_snippets.md)
* New: [Show the progresion of a long running task with dots.](bash_snippets.md#show-the-progresion-of-a-long-running-task-with-dots)
    ```bash
    echo -n "Process X is running."
    sleep 1
    echo -n "."
    sleep 1
    echo -n "."
    echo ""
    ```
### [lua](lua.md)
* New: [Inspect contents of Lua table in Neovim.](lua.md#inspect-contents-of-lua-table-in-neovim)
    When using Lua inside of Neovim you may need to view the contents of Lua tables, which are a first class data structure in Lua world. Tables in Lua can represent ordinary arrays, lists, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc.
    If you try to just print a table directly, you will get the reference address for that table instead of the content, which is not very useful for most debugging purposes:
    ```lua
    :lua print(vim.api.nvim_get_mode())
    " table: 0x7f5b93e5ff88
    ```
    To solve this, Neovim provides the `vim.inspect` function as part of its API. It serializes the content of any Lua object into a human readable string.
    For example you can get information about the current mode like so:
    ```lua
    :lua print(vim.inspect(vim.api.nvim_get_mode()))
    " {  blocking = false,  mode = "n"}
    ```
### [Boto3](boto3.md)
* New: [Get running instances.](boto3.md#get-running-instances)
    ```python
    import boto3
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    running_instances = [
        instance
        for page in ec2.get_paginator('describe_instances').paginate()
        for reservation in page['Reservations']
        for instance in reservation['Instances']]
        if instance['State']['Name'] == 'running'
    ]
    ```
### [SQLite](sqlite.md)
* New: [Order by a column descending.](sqlite.md#order-by-a-column-descending)
    ```sql
