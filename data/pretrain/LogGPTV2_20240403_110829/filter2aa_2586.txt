## Overview
CollabREate is an innovative plugin for Ida Pro, designed to facilitate collaborative reverse engineering. This tool aims to address the challenges of sharing and synchronizing analysis efforts among multiple users.

### Shameless Plug
Stay tuned! CollabREate will soon be available at finer bookstores and online.

## Defcon 16 Presentation

### Why CollabREate?
- **Spelling and Collaboration:** The primary motivation was the need for multiple people to collaborate on a project and synchronize their reverse engineering (RE) efforts.
- **Current Limitations:**
  - Sharing IDBs (IDA databases) is problematic, slow, and does not allow for merging changes.
  - Users often have different versions of IDA, complicating collaboration.
  - Existing solutions like Ida Sync, while useful, were limited and had issues.

### Goals
- **Automatic Synchronization:** Automatically sync up to the current IDB state when connecting.
- **Project Management:** Allow multiple projects and provide safety for connecting to the correct one.
- **Flexibility:** Enable users to enter or exit collaboration at will.
- **Forking:** Support forking of projects when participants decide to try different approaches.
- **Granularity:** Allow control over what actions each participant can perform, both globally and within specific projects.

## Basic Idea
- **Event Hooking:** Hook as many IDA actions (events) as possible. For example, when a user creates a comment, a datagram is sent to the server.
- **Server Role:**
  - Mirrors the datagram to all other interested IDA sessions.
  - Caches the datagram for users who are not currently connected.
- **Asynchronous Communication:**
  - Asynchronous communication is challenging due to IDA's single-threaded nature.
  - Windows asynchronous sockets post messages to the application's message queue, handled in the GUI event loop.
  - Techniques used by Ida Sync and IdaRub have been improved for better robustness.

### IDA-Specific Challenges
- **Pre-Action Hooks:** There is no pre-action hook in IDA yet, which can make it difficult to know the state before a change.
- **Event Information:** Some events do not provide enough information, such as structure rename/delete operations where the old name is unknown.
- **Kernel and SDK Patches:** These challenges led to some IDA kernel and SDK patches, including the discovery and resolution of a bug in the notification API.

## User Interface
- **Native Controls:** CollabREate uses native API GUI controls/boxes.
- **Limitations of IDA SDK:** The IDA SDK offers some user interface elements, but they are too limiting, lacking features like user-defined drop-down lists and password fields.

## Expanding the Idea
- **Feature Enhancements:** Once development began, several "wouldn't this be nice" features emerged, including:
  - Project management
  - Project forking
  - Checkpoints
  - Project migration to another CollabREate server
  - Undo functionality
  - Ability to work offline and merge changes
  - Publish and subscribe permissions

### Challenges
- **Undo Functionality:** IDA stores the original byte value but does not provide access to the previous value, making undo operations difficult.
- **Offline Work:** Merging changes from offline work requires conflict resolution, which can be complex, especially with granular publish/subscribe controls.

## CollabREate Plugin
- **Activation:** The plugin registers and becomes available after the initial auto-analysis is complete.
- **State Management:** Very little state is maintained by the plugin/IDA.
- **Event Handling:** IDA events trigger the packaging and sending of datagrams to the server.

### Operation
- **Event Notifications:** Instead of introducing new hotkey sequences, CollabREate processes event notifications, ensuring easy installation and minimal risk of forgetting to send updates.

### Plugin Details
- **Compatibility:** Supports IDA Pro versions 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and IDA Freeware 4.9.
- **Compilation Requirements:**
  - g++ or Visual Studio
  - IDA SDK for your version of IDA
  - Cygwin users need to ensure they have `make`, `g++`, etc.
- **SDK Note:** No official SDK for Freeware 4.9, but a custom SDK was created.

**Note:** IDA 5.2 and an updated IDA 5.2 kernel are required for full structure updates to be properly published.

## CollabREate Protocol
- **Communication:** Asynchronous communication using a binary protocol.
- **Command Types:**
  - IDA update datagram (forwarded to other plugins)
  - Control messages intended only for the server
- **Datagram Structure:**
  - Datagram Size (4 bytes)
  - UpdateID (8 bytes)
  - Command (4 bytes)
  - IDA Data (? bytes)
  - Control Data (? bytes)

## CollabREate Server
- **Role:** Maintains most of the state, handles messages, and forwards/replies accordingly.
- **Modes:**
  - **Basic Mode:** Simple reflector with no persistence.
  - **Database Mode:** JDBC interaction with persistent storage.
- **Components:**
  - Executable jar server to run in the background.
  - Executable jar management app.

### Basic Mode
- **No Database Required:** Allows multiple projects per binary, selectable by name.
- **No Authentication:** No storage mechanism for auth info, no permissions.
- **No Meta Data:** Leaves no metadata in the IDB.
- **Synchronization:** All participants must start at the same time with an IDB in the same state.

### Database Mode
- **Database Support:** Tested with PostgreSQL (8.2+) and MySQL (5.0).
- **Authentication:** Requires authentication to the server (CHAP/HMAC).
- **Flexible Joining:** Participants can connect to the server at any time after auto-analysis.
- **Meta Information:** Stored in the IDB, facilitating temporary disconnections and reconnections.
- **Multiple Sessions:** Allows the same user to have multiple sessions.
- **Attribution:** Can be used for attribution.

  - If new, the server sends a list of compatible projects based on the binary's MD5.
- **Project Selection/Creation:**
  - Choose from compatible projects.
  - Set desired permissions.
- **Additional Commands:** Overload the activation key for additional functionality.

### Other Interesting Uses
- **Learning Environment:** Projects can be set up as "read-only" for students, allowing the project owner to push updates without fear of student interference.
- **Script and Plugin Installation:** Install a plugin or script on one collabREating copy of IDA, and the effects are mirrored to other collaborators.

## Future Work
- **New API:** Will allow more events to be hooked.
- **Pre-Hook Events:** Facilitate an UNDO feature.
- **Better Permission Interface:**
- **Merge Algorithm:** For offline changes (maybe).
- **Project Migration:** Across servers.

## FAQ
- **Q: Since you must open the binary and allow IDA to complete the auto-analysis prior to connecting to the CollabREate server, won’t different versions of IDA result in a slightly different disassembly?**
  - **A:** You could force IDA to not do any analysis upon opening, then start the plugin, and force a re-analysis. However, in practice, the auto-analyses from different versions are close enough most of the time for effective collaboration.
- **Q: How did you make a plugin for the freeware?**
  - **A:** A custom freeware-specific SDK was created. More details at [http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/IDA_Free_4.9_SDK_Library_Patch](http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/IDA_Free_4.9_SDK_Library_Patch) (YMMV).
- **Q: Does the plugin control the focus in IDA? (e.g., can attached plugins automatically scroll?)**
  - **A:** No. This would have limited usefulness for collaboration, and IDA does not provide access to these kinds of events.
