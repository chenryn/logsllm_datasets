ABSTRACT
In this paper we present a structured methodology for eval-
uating cost of responses based on three factors: the response
operational cost associated with the daily maintenance of the
response, the response goodness that measures the applica-
bility of the selected response for a detected intrusion and
the response impact on the system that refers to the possible
response eﬀect on the system functionality. The proposed
approach provides a consistent basis for response evaluation
across diﬀerent systems while incorporating security policy
and properties of the speciﬁc system environment.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years the trend toward cost-sensitive modeling of
response selection became more apparent [3, 1, 2, 6, 4]. The
primary aim for applying such models is to balance intru-
sion damage and response cost to ensure adequate response
without sacriﬁcing the normal functionality of the system
under attack. However, one of the challenges in applying
this approach is deﬁning accurate and consistent measure-
ment of the cost factors on the basis of requirements and
policies of the system being protected against intrusions.
One of the primary problems in this context is to iden-
tify whether or not a response should be deployed, in other
words, what is the best suited action when an intrusion is

detected. This problem primarily stems from the fact that
though responses are deployed with the goal of countering
an intrusion, they may not only fail but can also lead to
undesired eﬀects on the system. Thus, often the primary
criteria in response selection mechanisms are the expected
eﬀectiveness of the response against the intrusion and its
potential negative impact on the system.
The eﬀectiveness of a response refers to both the ability
of the response to prevent or mitigate damage from the in-
trusion and the coverage of the response, i.e., the number
of intrusions it can potentially address. One of the intuitive
ways to measure the eﬀect of the response is to consider the
system resources aﬀected by the intrusion and protected by
the response.
Another factor characterizing the response is its poten-
tial eﬀect on the system. While the responses are deployed
against a detected intrusion, they often alter the state of the
system negatively aﬀecting system resources and leading to
damage.
Although the response eﬀect on the detected intrusion and
its impact on the system resources are the primary char-
acteristics considered for intrusion response, several impor-
tant factors remain behind the scenes: administrator time
and additional system resources (i.e., storage, network band-
width, etc.) required for response setup and processing. Col-
lectively, we will refer to these factors as operational cost.
While this cost does not directly aﬀect the attacked system
or the intrusion, it can signiﬁcantly contribute to the deci-
sion of which response to deploy.
In light of the above, we present a structured system in-
dependent methodology for the evaluation of responses’ cost
based on the three parameters: (a) the response goodness in
addressing the detected intrusion(s) which includes the ef-
fectiveness of the response and its coverage capability, (b)
the damage incurred by a response on the system and (c) the
operational cost of a response on a given system.
Within this methodology, we propose to assess response
impact with respect to resources of the aﬀected system. Our
model takes into account the relative importance of the sys-
tem resources determined through the review of the system
policy goals according to the following categories: conﬁden-
tiality, availability and integrity.
This methodology does not substitute the response selec-
tion process in the case of a detected intrusion, but rather
allows one to evaluate the available responses in a consistent
fashion. We have implemented the proposed response cost
evaluation methodology and believe that it can be employed
to guide system administrators during the response selection

The main contributions of this work can be summarized
as follows:
1. Structured and comprehensive methodology for
assigning response costs: the proposed model presents
the eﬀective roadmap for deﬁning a standardized met-
ric for response cost evaluation.
2. System independent evaluation model: the pro-
posed model is adaptable to diﬀerent environment set-
tings, ie. systems with widely varying operational re-
quirements.
3. Consistent response metrics: the proposed eval-
uation metrics are deﬁned in terms of the system re-
sources that bring a common ground to the assessment
process.
4. Adaptable evaluation metrics: the response met-
rics are quantiﬁed with respect to the security policies
and properties of the speciﬁc system. Thus, the com-
puted costs can be eﬀortlessly adjusted as and when
the system requirements are modiﬁed.
2. RESPONSE COST EVALUATION MODEL
The evaluation of the intrusion response cost is performed
in three dimensions: the operational cost (OC) of a response
in a given environment, that measures various aspects of the
response associated with its daily maintenance; the response
goodness (RG) with respect to detected intrusion(s) that pro-
vides a measure of the ability of the corresponding response
to mitigate damage caused by the intrusion to the system re-
sources; and ﬁnally, the response impact on the system(RSI)
that quantiﬁes the negative eﬀect of the response on the sys-
tem resources and that is estimated independently from the
response success or failure in countering the intrusion(s).
Intuitively, the combination of the OC and the RSI con-
stitutes the penalty associated with the response, while the
RG is the beneﬁt of this response measure. One simple cost
model describing the overall measure of response cost RC is:
RC = OC + RSI − RG
(1)
Figure 1 presents the overview of steps for evaluating the
response cost RC (following Equation 1). In the proceeding
discussion we introduce each step in detail.
Step 1: System classiﬁcation.
1The experimental results can be found in [5]
The ﬁrst step in quantifying the cost of a response involves
determining the characteristics of the computing environ-
ment where the response will be deployed. For example,
the system can be classiﬁed in terms of the security goals
as an open-access system with minor or none security re-
strictions (e.g., public networks provided at airport) or as
a safety-critical system with emphasis on the service avail-
ability. The classiﬁcation process should provide important
insights to the risks that each class of systems can tolerate,
and therefore help in measuring the cost for various types of
intrusion damages.
Step 2: The system policy goals.
The determination of the importance of the system policy
goals, and subsequently, the assessment of the potential risks
are the responsibilities of the organization to which the sys-
tem belongs. It is usually a manual process consisting of an
informal series of questions such as “Will data be exposed?”,
“How critical is the conﬁdentiality of the data?”, “How con-
cerned are we with data integrity?”, “Will service availability
be impacted?”, etc. This provides an ad-hoc relative assess-
ment of the system goals for the organization. Based on
the above observation, system policy goals can be deﬁned
in terms of: a) Conﬁdentiality that refers to the imposed
restrictions on information ﬂows, e.g., restricted access to
data. b) Integrity that is a guarantee of the consistency
and accuracy of the information or the system computing
environment as a whole. c) Availability that indicates the
requirement of (functionality, storage etc.) service and in-
formation availability upon request.
These categories of system goals are ranked according to
their importance (a value between 0 for no importance and 1
for absolute importance) in a particular system type (safety-
critical, security-critical, etc.). These decisions can be based
on monetary values or other established business metrics for
the cost of failure to meet system goals (e.g., the estimated
dollar cost of a conﬁdentiality breach).
In the case of a
classiﬁed data processing system (a security-critical system),
for instance, data conﬁdentiality may be a 1, indicating the
absolute importance of this security facet for this system.
Step 3: System resources.
Responses are reactions to the intrusions and are directed
to protect the system resources threatened by an attack.
System resources can be broadly viewed as the system assets
(e.g., host, network, etc.), services provided by the system
(e.g., FTP, HTTP, ﬁle system, etc.) and users served by the
system.
One of the initial steps in the process for computing a re-
sponse impact measure is the enumeration of the resources
available in the considered system. The importance of a
resource depends on the system policy goals which in turn
depend on the type of system. For example, for a simple
Web server, availability is an important policy goal and ac-
cordingly important resources will include HTTP. Therefore,
the resources are assigned weights according to their im-
portance for each system policy goal for a speciﬁc system.
The overall weight of the system resource, denoted by WSR,
is computed as a combination of the resource importance
for each policy goal category SRimportancei (i is the pol-
icy category index) and the system speciﬁc category weight
PolicyCategoryWeighti (weight of the i-th policy category
index):
389(cid:88)
WSR =
[SRimportancei × PolicyCategoryWeighti] (2)
To illustrate this process, lets consider the example of the
network interface resource and its importance for each policy
category for a public Web server:
