Currently the tabs on SQL Lab queries show green circle when a query is
running as well as when a query has successfully finished.
The green circles for "query running" and "query completed" could be made more
distinct - different color, or having the "query running" circle be hollow,
and the "query completed" one filled in. This would enable users, who might go
to SQL Lab and trigger few queries and then want to view results, visually see
which of their queries are still running vs. finished.
Screenshot current state:  
One query is running one has finished. User sees both as just a green circle.
