ABSTRACT
Existing CP-ABE schemes incur very large ciphertext size,
which increases linearly with respect to the number of at-
tributes in the access policy. Large ciphertext prevents CP-
ABE from being adopted in the communication constrained
environments. In this paper, we proposed a new construc-
tion of CP-ABE, named Constant-size CP-ABE (denoted
as CCP-ABE) that signiﬁcantly reduces the ciphertext to a
constant size for an AND gate access policy with any given
number of attributes. Each ciphertext in CCP-ABE requires
only 2 elements on a bilinear group.
Based on CCP-ABE, we further proposed an Attribute
Based Broadcast Encryption (ABBE) scheme. Compared to
existing Broadcast Encryption (BE) schemes, ABBE is more
ﬂexible because a broadcasted message can be encrypted by
an expressive access policy, either with or without explicit
specifying the receivers. Moreover, ABBE signiﬁcantly re-
duces the storage and communication overhead to the order
of O(log N ), where N is the system size.

INTRODUCTION
Research in Ciphtertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryp-
tion (CP-ABE) has been a very active area in recent years
[1, 4, 3, 5]. Under the construction of CP-ABE, an attribute
is a descriptive string assigned to (or associated with) an en-
tity and each entity may be tagged with multiple attributes.
Many entities may share common attributes, which allow
message encryptors to specify a data access policy by com-
posing multiple attributes through logical operators such as
“AND”, “OR”, etc. To decrypt the message, the decryptor’s
attributes need to satisfy the access policy.
Apart from the promising features provided by CP-ABE
solutions, there is a major problem of the existing CP-ABE
schemes, which usually incur large, linearly increasing ci-
phertext. In the CP-ABE schemes reported in [1, 3, 5], the

size of a ciphertext increases linearly with respect to the
number of included attributes. For example, the message
size in BSW CP-ABE [1] starts at about 630 bytes, and
each additional attribute adds about 250-300 bytes.
In this paper, we propose a novel CP-ABE construction,
named Constant-size Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based En-
cryption (CCP-ABE), which incurs constant-size of cipher-
text, regardless of the number of attributes in a logical AN D
data access policy with wildcards. Besides the encrypted
message and encoded access policy, each ciphertext only re-
quires 2 bilinear group elements, which are bounded by 300
bytes in total.
Based on presented CCP-ABE, we further provide a new
construction named as Attribute Based Broadcast Encryp-
tion (ABBE) that supports eﬃcient Broadcast Encryption
(BE). In existing BE schemes, e.g., [2], a broadcaster en-
crypts a message for an speciﬁed set of receivers who are
listening on a broadcast channel. Each receiver in the speci-
ﬁed set can decrypt the message while all other receivers that
are not in the speciﬁed set cannot decrypt even though they
collude together. However, in a system with large number of
users, identifying every decryptor may be impractical. For
example, to broadcast a message to all Computer Science
students, the encryptor needs to query a central directory
to get the contact information from every CS student in the
roaster, in which the operation could be very expensive and
time consuming. Using ABBE, an encryptor has the ﬂexibil-
ity to encrypt the broadcasted data using CCP-ABE, either
with or without the information of each intended receiver.
ABBE also signiﬁcantly reduces the storage overhead com-
pared to many existing BE schemes. For example, in BGW
scheme [2], the public key size is O(N ) or O(N 1=2), where N
is the number of users in the system. ABBE addresses this
key storage overhead problem by optimizing the organiza-
tion of attribute hierarchy to minimize the storage require-
ment for each user to O(log N + m), where m is a constant
number and m ≪ N .
2. BACKGROUND AND MODELS
Bilinear Pairing is a bilinear map function e : G0 × G0 →
G1, where G0 and G1 are two multiplicative cyclic groups
with large prime order p. The Discrete Logarithm Prob-
lem (DLP) on both G0 and G1 is hard. One of the pairing
properties is Bilinearity: e(P a; Qb) = e(P; Q)ab; ∀P; Q ∈
G0;∀a; b ∈ Z∗
p.
Decisional K-BDHE The decisional K-BDHE assumption
is said to be hold in G0 if there is no probabilistic polynomial
time adversary who is able to distinguish the following 2
753tuples:

with non-negligible advantage, where (cid:11); R ∈ Zp and g; h ∈
G0 are chosen independently and uniformly at random and
Yg;(cid:11);K = {g(cid:11); g((cid:11)2);··· ; g(cid:11)K

Faculty; A4 = Student}. Alice is a student in CS depart-
ment; Bob is a faculty in EE department; Carol is a faculty
holding a joint position in EE and CS department. Their

Let G0 be the bilinear group of prime order p. Trusted

random (cid:11) ∈ Zp. It computes gi = g((cid:11)i) for i = 1; 2;··· ; K; K+

Zp and sets v = g(cid:13) ∈ G0. The public key is: P K =

The master key M K = {(cid:13); (cid:11)} is guarded by the TA.
