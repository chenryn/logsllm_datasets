User: Please use the Python language to implement a piece of code to monitor the CPU utilization rate, memory usage rate, disk remaining space and other indicators of a server, and set an early warning mechanism.
Assistant: The following is a code snippet based on Python to monitor the server's CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk remaining space: ``` python import psutil # set threshold cpu_warning = 90 # issue a warning if it exceeds 90% mem_warning = 80 # exceed 80% Issue a warning disk_warning = 50 # Issue a warning if the disk space is lower than 50G # Monitor CPU utilization cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1) if cpu_percent > cpu_warning: print("CPU utilization exceeds {}%".format(cpu_warning)) # Monitor memory usage mem_percent = psutil.virtual_memory().percent if mem_percent > mem_warning: print("Memory usage exceeds {}%".format(mem_warning)) # Monitor disk remaining space disk_status = psutil.disk_usage("/" ) disk_free = disk_status.free / (1024**3) # Convert bytes to G if disk_free < disk_warning: print("There is not enough space left on the disk {}G".format(disk_warning)) ``` This code uses The psutil module realizes the monitoring of CPU utilization, memory utilization, and remaining disk space, and adds threshold settings at the same time, and sends a warning message when the warning threshold is exceeded. In this way, abnormal conditions of the server can be detected in time to avoid unexpected damage to the system. When an early warning situation is encountered, corresponding measures can be taken in time to ensure the stability and reliability of the server.
