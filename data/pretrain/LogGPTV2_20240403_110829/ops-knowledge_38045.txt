User: What is container orchestration technology (Container Orchestration), and examples?
Assistant: Container orchestration technology is a software that automatically controls and manages container clusters, which can help users easily deploy, expand, and manage containerized applications. It can automatically handle the life cycle of application containers, as well as configuration, network, storage and service discovery, and provide reliability, elasticity and high availability features. For example, Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration technology, which provides a complete container cluster management solution, which can help users realize the automation and centralized management of containers. It includes features such as autoscaling, load balancing, container orchestration, autohealing, and rolling upgrades. Kubernetes provides features such as consistency, scalability, and automation, which can help users implement a container-based microservice architecture and accelerate application development, testing, deployment, and operation and maintenance.
