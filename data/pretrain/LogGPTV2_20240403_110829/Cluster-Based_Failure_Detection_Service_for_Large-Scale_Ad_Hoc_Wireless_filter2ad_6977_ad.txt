As discussed in Section 4, the consequences would be
severe if a DCH makes a false detection on the CH. There-
fore, we next evaluate the probability of such an event, de-
noted by P (False detection on CH). The evaluation results
are shown in Figure 6. (Due to space limitations, we omit
the description of the measure’s formulation.) The curves
reveal that for the range of node population size considered,
the likelihood of such a false detection is practically neg-
ligible or extremely low when p is below 0.25. When p
reaches 0.5, P (False detection on CH) is still very low for
N = 100 and N = 75, and the value of this measure is still
below 10−6 even when N drops to 50.

To contrast Figure 5 with Figure 6, it seems a bit sur-
prising that the CH is more likely than the DCH to make a
false detection. A careful examination reveals that those are
indeed reasonable results. Speciﬁcally, during an FDS exe-
cution, the responsibility of the CH is to examine the health
of everyone else in a cluster C, while the duty of the DCH is
to check whether the CH itself is healthy. Recall that the CH
is selected by the clustering algorithm in such a way that all
the members in C are at most one hop away from the CH,
and thus the CH’s heartbeat may be heard by everyone else
in the cluster; however, a non-CH node is away from the
center and thus can be heard or overheard by only a subset
of the cluster members. This factor implies that it is more
likely that the CH’s heartbeat will be reﬂected in at least
one digest received by the DCH, than that the heartbeat of a
non-CH node will be reﬂected in at least one digest received
by the CH. As explained in Section 4.2, the accuracy of a
DCH’s decision will be more critical than that of a CH’s de-
cision, hence the results discussed above are indeed highly
desirable.
5.2 Measure Concerning Completeness
According to its deﬁnition, the completeness property of
the FDS will ultimately also be determined by the robust-
ness of intra-cluster communication. Speciﬁcally, after a
CH detects a failure or receives a failure report from an-
other cluster, the failure report should be received by every
member in the cluster. This means that system-wide com-
pleteness will be a function of the probability that a cluster
member will receive a failure report, given that such a re-
port is broadcast by the CH. Hence, it will be meaningful
for us to solve this constituent probabilistic measure. For
clarity of illustration, we compute its complement, which is
denoted as P (Incompleteness).
As described in Section 4.2, intra-cluster completeness
is enhanced by progressive peer forwarding. Note that the
peers must be the in-cluster, immediate neighbors of v, a
node that needs help to recover a lost message. Further-
more, as revealed by Figures 4(a) and 4(b), the number
of v’s in-cluster neighbors is a decreasing function of v’s
distance from the CH. Thus, much as in the evaluation
of ˆP (False detection), we can compute the upper bound of
P (Incompleteness), denoted by ˆP (Incompleteness), if the
evaluation is based on the case in which v is located on the
circumference of the cluster (see Figure 4(b)).
While space limitations do not allow us to describe the
measure formulation, the results are displayed in Figure 7.
The curves demonstrate that the completeness property of
the FDS is robust against message loss.
In addition, it can be observed in Figure 7 that when N
increases from 50 to 100, ˆP (Incompleteness) decreases sig-
niﬁcantly. On the other hand, ˆP (Incompleteness) becomes
more sensitive to p when N becomes larger. Moreover, a
similar phenomenon can be observed in Figures 5 and 6.
The phenomena are indeed due to some interesting interac-
tions among N, p, and the measures we choose. First, when
R is ﬁxed, an increase of N actually means an increase of
node population density in a cluster. Then, as N increases,
spatial redundancy and inherent message redundancy will
increase accordingly. In turn, this implies a decreased like-
lihood of false detection and an increased probability of a
successful peer-assisted message-loss recovery, for a given
value of p. On the other hand, a larger N means more mes-
saging activities in a cluster; that, in turn, makes the system
behavior more sensitive to the variations of p.

6 Concluding Remarks
We have developed an algorithm for failure detection in
distributed systems that are constituted over ad hoc wireless
networks. By exploiting a cluster-based communication ar-
chitecture, we are able to make the failure detection service
scalable and resilient to link failure. Moreover, by taking
advantage of the inherent message redundancy in ad hoc
wireless networks, we allow intra- and inter-cluster com-
munication to be resilient to message loss and node failure.
Conceptually, the impossibility of providing determin-
istic guarantees of failure detection completeness and ac-
curacy in ad hoc wireless networks is closely related to
the impossibility of reliably distinguishing a process that
is crashed from one that is just very slow in general asyn-
chronous systems [13]. Nonetheless, while ad hoc network
settings exacerbate the impossibility of developing a reli-
able failure detector, their characteristics can be utilized for
implementation of failure detection services that provide
probabilistic guarantees for the desired properties. Accord-
ingly, the contribution of this investigation is twofold. First,
this effort demonstrates the feasibility of developing failure
detection services that can provide probabilistic guarantees
of completeness and accuracy for large-scale distributed ap-

plications that are built over ad hoc wireless networks. Sec-
ond, our novel application of the notion of clustering en-
ables an FDS to exploit inherent message redundancy to
achieve both robustness and efﬁciency. As clustering ap-
proaches are becoming increasingly popular for large-scale
ad hoc network applications, this investigation fosters a fu-
sion between the technologies of fault tolerance and wire-
less networking.
It is worth noting that cluster-based communication ar-
chitectures can also be utilized for scalable, robust aggrega-
tion (e.g., coordinated in-network computation for average,
maximum, or minimum of sensor measurements) [12] in
large sensor networks. This indeed suggests that a cluster-
based FDS may become an integral part of application-level
host coordination activities. Speciﬁcally, by exploiting a
cluster-based communication architecture and developing
sensible aggregation query and data routing algorithms, it
will be possible to embed an FDS in the aggregation query
and data routing activities. The anticipated beneﬁts include
1) energy efﬁciency induced by the “message sharing” be-
tween failure detection and data aggregation, and 2) further
improvement of failure detection accuracy resulting from
the sharing of the algorithms for reliable aggregation, such
as the “streaming aggregates” proposed in [12].
We also note that a cluster-based architecture may sup-
port sleep/wakeup power management strategies for ad hoc
wireless networks [18], since clustering may naturally help
circumvent connectivity problems caused by node sleeping.
On the other hand, sleep mode may cause false detections.
Accordingly, we plan to investigate the feasibility of em-
bedding FDS in application-level host coordination activi-
ties and of deriving algorithms to reduce the likelihood of
sleep-mode-caused false detection.
