Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    var myStr; // Change this line
    myStr = "FirstLine\n\\SecondLine\\\rThirdLine";
> FirstLinenewlinebackslashSecondLinebackslashcarriage-returnThirdLine
It made me very confused!  
I just can't understand this, and why not directly show off the result effect
of pic?  
just like this!
