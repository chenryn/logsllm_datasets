User: I am writing an IRC bot in Python. 
I wish to make stand-alone binaries for Linux and Windows of it. And mainly I wish that when the bot initiates, the console window should hide and the user should not be able to see the window.
What can I do for that?
Assistant: In linux, just run it, no problem.  In Windows, you want to use the pythonw executable.
Update
Okay, if I understand the question in the comments, you're asking how to make the command window in which you've started the bot from the command line go away afterwards?

UNIX (Linux)


$ nohup mypythonprog &


Windows


C:/> start pythonw mypythonprog

I think that's right.  In any case, now you can close the terminal.
