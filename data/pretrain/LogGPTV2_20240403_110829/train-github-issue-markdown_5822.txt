There appears to be an issue with the challenge located at http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-target-a-specific-child-of-an-element-using-jquery. The problem is that even when users submit the correct solution, which is:

```javascript
$('.well:nth-child(2)').addClass("animated bounce");
```

the system does not allow them to proceed. Currently, a workaround suggested by user **@saadmehmood233** involves adding spaces before and after the colon in the selector, like so:

```javascript
$('.well :nth-child(2)').addClass("animated bounce");
```

However, these additional spaces are not required according to the syntax and should not be mandatory for the solution to be accepted. Therefore, the requirement for these spaces should be removed to ensure the challenge functions correctly.
