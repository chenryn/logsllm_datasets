Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-target-a-specific-
child-of-an-element-using-jquery has an issue.
The challenge will not allow the user to proceed even after posting the right
solution i.e.
    $('.well:nth-child(2)').addClass("animated bounce");
Currently the workaround to get ahead is to add a space after before and after
the colon(Thanks to user **@saadmehmood233** for pointing it out). The use of
these spaces should not be binding as they are not required as per the syntax
and it should be removed.
