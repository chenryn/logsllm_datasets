**What happened** :  
When deleting a ReplicaSet, the orphan parameter is populated, but the pods
are never removed, blocking the RS from being deleted.
**What you expected to happen** :  
RS is deleted
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
Create a RS and attempt to delete it from either the UI or kubectl.
  1. Create RS and spin up pods
  2. Delete the RS
  3. Delete will succeed, but the object will never disappear. The orphan parameter is applied to the object.
  4. With `kubectl edit`, removing the orphan parameter will result in successful deletion.
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
The Tectonic Console issues delete requests with `orphanDependents=false`. It
seems like the orphan component is not running at all. I'm not sure where to
best debug that or in which control loop it runs.
