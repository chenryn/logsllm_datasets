User: I managed to run examples in command prompt after running mavproxy.py and loading droneapi. But when I double click on on my script, it throws me "'local_connect' is not defined", it runs in terminal as was told above, but I cannot run it only with double click. So my question is: Is there any way to run script using droneapi only with double click?
using Windows 8.1
Thanks in advance
Assistant: I think Sony Nguyen is asking for running the vehicle_state.py outside the Mavproxy command prompt, just like runnning the .py file normally.
I'm also looking for a solution as well.
