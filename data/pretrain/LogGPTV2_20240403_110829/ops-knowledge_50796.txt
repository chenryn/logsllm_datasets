Question: A pen tester is evaluating the security of a web application by examining its HTML source code. The tester finds several META tags within the HEAD section of the document. Which of the following purposes of these META tags should be of particular interest to the tester for identifying potential security vulnerabilities?
"A": "META tags that specify the website's color theme and tile color, as they directly impact the application's user interface and user experience.",
"B": "META tags that include social networking previews and search engine indexing information, as they can inadvertently reveal paths, technology details, or functionality not intended for public disclosure.",
"C": "META tags that provide information about the website's content management system, as they are required for the proper operation of web spiders, robots, or crawlers.",
"D": "META tags that describe the document's character encoding, as incorrect character encoding could lead to security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting attacks."
Answer: B
