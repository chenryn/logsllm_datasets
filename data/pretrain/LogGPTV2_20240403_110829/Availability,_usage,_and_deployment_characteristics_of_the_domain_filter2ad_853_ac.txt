4. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
This section enumerates our measurement results and analyzes
their signiﬁcance. We ﬁrst examine the relative load distribution on
different nameservers, then perform an in-depth analysis of name
server availability, failure and recovery times, and ﬁnally enumer-
ate several common “deployment styles” that we observed in dif-
ferent types of organizations.
4.1 Relative Load Distribution
Figure 3 (a) and (b) show the cumulative distribution of relative
load among LDNS and ADNS servers, respectively. Not surpris-
ingly, the distribution is very skewed, with the majority of name-
servers lightly loaded (i.e., generating or receiving less than 100
requests to Akamai or from the Web caches in a week’s period),
but a few that are much more heavily loaded (i.e., generating or re-
ceiving over 1 million requests). This is indicative of the diversity
in the size of organizations behind individual LDNS servers (e.g.,
small businesses to large residential ISPs). It also suggests that the
vast majority of nameservers have few users.
However, as Figure 4 (a) and (b) demonstrate, the “small” name-
servers make up a very small fraction of the total load in the system.
In the LDNS case, over 95% of servers made fewer than 10,000
requests to Akamai each, and their aggregate request count was
only about 10% of the total number of requests generated by all
the servers in the system. In the ADNS case, over 80% of servers
received fewer than 100 requests from the web cache, and those
requests constituted fewer than 5% of all requests sent. Hence, al-
though most name servers are lightly loaded, most users are likely
behind the smaller number of highly loaded nameservers. The dis-
tribution for LDNS servers does not quite obey a power law; highly
ranked servers have relative loads within the same order of magni-
Figure 4: Aggregate Load Distribution: These ﬁgures show
the fraction of total load that is accounted for by LDNS and
ADNS servers with relative load less than x (using ldns-
nondynamic and adns-web, respectively). For example,
consider all LDNS servers that generated less than 10,000 re-
quests each. Their aggregated load makes up about 10% of the
total load seen by Akamai.
tude, possibly due to capacity limitations of the server machines, or
due to more effective caching of low TTL records with extremely
high request rates.
4.2 Availability
This section describe and analyze our measurements from the
active probing experiment. Recall that during this experiment, we
actively probed our set of LDNS and ADNS servers for a two-week
period and recorded their responsiveness throughout the period. We
begin by showing the overall availability numbers for LDNS and
ADNS servers. Second, we discuss the correlation between avail-
ability and relative load. Third, we brieﬂy describe the impact of
the time of day on availability, and examine the extent to which
failures are locally correlated. Then, we present a rough estimate
of the time to failure and time to recovery of DNS servers. Finally,
we revisit LDNS servers using dynamic IPs and estimate the arrival
rate of new IPs they use in the system.
4.2.1 Overall Availability
We deﬁne the availability of a DNS server to be the ratio of
the number of probes that it responded to and the total number
of probes sent to it. Because the intervals between our probes
were exponentially distributed, the PASTA principal dictates that
we should see approximately the average fraction of time that a
given server was available and unavailable.
Figure 5 summarizes the overall availability of LDNS and ADNS
servers and plots the cumulative distribution of servers with a given
availability. As is visible, the vast majority of both ADNS and
LDNS servers are available for almost the entire duration of our ex-
periment. In fact, 62% of LDNS servers and 64% of ADNS servers

bution of availability of LDNS and ADNS servers (using ldns-
avail and adns-avail). The table above it summarizes the
availability statistics.
had 0 probe failures. Only 5% of LDNS servers (ADNS servers)
were available for less than 92% (95%) of the time. As noted ear-
lier, a few of these may be attributed to network failures, so the
actual availability may be even higher. This should not be very sur-
prising since these DNS servers are actively serving DNS requests
and downtime may mean lack of service for an LDNS server’s or-
ganization or an ADNS server’s customers. However, we note that
a non-trivial number of individual servers only have “one 9” (or
less) of availability, a far cry from the “ﬁve 9s” usually desired for
critical services.
We observe that ADNS servers have a slightly higher availability
than LDNS servers in general. Keeping in mind that we are ignor-
ing LDNS servers that may be behind dynamic IPs, the difference
is probably higher in reality. In fact, when examining only ADNS
servers in adns-web (that is, the ADNS servers authoritative for
at least one website accessed by the web cache), the average avail-
ability is even higher, as the next section shows. This might indicate
that content providers may be better equipped to keep DNS servers
running (or that they have a greater incentive) than network admin-
istrators managing servers that only serve the internal population of
an organization. Nonetheless, both ADNS and LDNS servers are
supposed to be replicated [25], so a single DNS server failure does
not necessarily imply that the service itself is unavailable.
4.2.2 Load vs. Availability
Next, we investigate whether the nameservers that are used more
(i.e., are serving a larger population of clients) are more likely to
have high availability than those that are used less. Recall that we
deﬁned the relative load on an LDNS server to be the number of
A-requests that it sent to Akamai during a one week period. We de-
ﬁned the relative load on an ADNS server as the number of HTTP
requests sent to websites it served that we observed in a one-week
log trace of several web caches. We take load to be an approxima-
tion of server usage.
For our analysis, we only use LDNS servers that appear in both
ldns-nondynamic and ldns-load, and ADNS servers that
appear in both adns-all and adns-load, since we have both
availability and relative load estimates for only these servers. Al-

Figure 7: Relative Load vs. Availability Summary: The top
half of this table shows the average availability of LDNS and
ADNS servers with given ranges of relative loads. The bottom
half shows the correlation coefﬁcient for relative load and avail-
ability and that for the log of the load and availability. Note that
the load on LDNS and ADNS servers are estimates of different
characteristics.
though the availability distribution of this subset of LDNS servers
was not signiﬁcantly different than that of all LDNS servers, the
average availability of the ADNS servers examined in this analysis
was higher than when examining the availability distribution for all
ADNS servers in adns-all, as presented in the previous section
(0.994 vs. 0.986). This observation is in line with our general con-
clusions, since presumably the DNS servers that did not appear in
the web cache logs were rarely used.
Figure 6 (a) and (b) show scatter plots comparing the relative
load and availability of LDNS and ADNS servers, respectively.
Clearly, there is a positive correlation between load and availabil-
ity, especially in the region between 80% and 100% availability
(we omit the 0% to 80% region in the ADNS case because there
are very few points in that region). Figure 7 summarizes the results
with the average availability of servers falling within a load range.
Although the positive trend is readily apparent, the correlation is
actually very minor; for example, an LDNS server that sent over
1 million requests to Akamai is only 1.02 times more likely to be
available than an LDNS server that sent under 100.
The bottom half of Figure 7 shows the correlation coefﬁcient
computed for relative load and availability over LDNS and ADNS
servers. Here we see that the correlation is indeed very slight (0.017
for LDNS, and 0.008 for ADNS).6 The correlation is more sig-
niﬁcant when we compute the coefﬁcient using the logarithm of
the relative load, indicating that the relationship between load and
availability may be better described as log-linear than linear.
4.2.3 Time-of-Day Effects
Now we explore whether the time of day is related to when fail-
ures occur. We attempt to discern the degree of time-of-day im-
pact on each server by comparing the availability during the hour
in which it is most likely to be available to that during the hour
in which it is least likely to be available. The ratio of the former
and the latter gives us an indication about how much more likely a
server will be available during an hour of the day. In this analysis,
we only consider the fraction of servers with availability less than
1.
Figure 8(a) shows the cumulative distribution of servers with this
statistic. About 70% of the servers are not more than 1.2 times as
likely to be available in one hour than any other. Hence, for the
majority of servers, time of day is unlikely to be related to when
failures are observed. However, 2.1% (0.7%) of the LDNS (ADNS)
6Despite the small correlation coefﬁcient, Pearson’s product-
moment correlation test indicates that the correlation is still sta-
tistically signiﬁcant, given the number of sample points we have.

ADNS servers are estimates of different values.

Local Time of Day
Figure 8: Time-of-Day Effects: (a) Shows a distribution of the
degree to which time of day impacts availability. The degree of
impact is deﬁned as the ratio of the maximum average availabil-
ity during a particular hour to the minimum, and indicates how
much more likely a server will be available during one hour
over another. (b) Shows the average availability during each
10 minute bucket in a day (adjusted to the server’s local time)
for all servers (the top two “All Failed” lines) and for servers
with an inﬁnite degree of impact (i.e., minimum availability is
0 for some hour).

availability in ldns-avail and adns-avail.)
servers had at least 1 hour with 0% availability (excluded from Fig-
ure 8(a)).
Figure 8(b) plots the average availability of servers during each
10 minute bucket in a day (adjusted to the server’s local time7). The
top two lines show the variation of the averages for all nameservers
(that had availability < 1), and the bottom two show the variation
of the averages for nameservers that had at least one hour with 0%
availability. There is almost no variation in the average availability
when looking at all nameservers. However, when looking only at
those that are very likely to be unavailable during some hour of the
day, we observe a clear diurnal pattern. In addition, these servers
have much lower overall availability. We believe it is likely that
these LDNS “servers” may be on end-user machines (though this
would not explain the small number of ADNS servers that behave
