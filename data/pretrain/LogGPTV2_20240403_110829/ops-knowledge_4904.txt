User: What will be the fastest way to check whether a folder size is beyond a specific size say 10 MB, 1 Gb , 10 GB etc, without actually calculating the folder size. Something like quota. A Pythonic solution will be great, but standard UNIX utilities also welcome
Assistant: Folder size is still the total size of the folder contents.
You may try to call du -s foldername from python
