To determine if a folder's size exceeds a specific threshold (e.g., 10 MB, 1 GB, 10 GB) without explicitly calculating the total size, you can use a combination of Python and standard UNIX utilities. Here’s a more detailed and professional approach:

### Using `du` Command with Python

The `du` command in UNIX is efficient for checking the size of a directory. You can call this command from Python and parse its output to check if the folder size exceeds the specified threshold.

Here’s a Python script that does this:

```python
import subprocess
import os

def is_folder_size_exceeds_threshold(folder_path, threshold):
    """
    Check if the size of the given folder exceeds the specified threshold.
    
    :param folder_path: Path to the folder
    :param threshold: Size threshold in bytes
    :return: True if the folder size exceeds the threshold, False otherwise
    """
    try:
        # Use du -s to get the summary size of the folder in bytes
        result = subprocess.run(['du', '-s', folder_path], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        
        if result.returncode != 0:
            raise Exception(f"Error running 'du -s {folder_path}': {result.stderr}")
        
        # Parse the output to get the size in bytes
        size_in_bytes = int(result.stdout.split()[0])
        
        return size_in_bytes > threshold
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return False

# Example usage
folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'
threshold_bytes = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10 MB

if is_folder_size_exceeds_threshold(folder_path, threshold_bytes):
    print(f"The folder size exceeds {threshold_bytes / (1024 * 1024)} MB.")
else:
    print(f"The folder size does not exceed {threshold_bytes / (1024 * 1024)} MB.")
```

### Explanation

1. **`subprocess.run`**: This function is used to run the `du -s` command, which returns the total size of the folder in kilobytes.
2. **Parsing the Output**: The output of `du -s` is parsed to extract the size in bytes.
3. **Threshold Comparison**: The extracted size is compared against the specified threshold.
4. **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling to manage any issues that may arise from running the `du` command.

### Standard UNIX Utilities

If you prefer to use only UNIX utilities, you can create a shell script or one-liner to achieve the same result. Here’s an example using `du` and `awk`:

```sh
folder_path="/path/to/your/folder"
threshold_kb=10240  # 10 MB in kilobytes

if [ $(du -sk "$folder_path" | awk '{print $1}') -gt $threshold_kb ]; then
    echo "The folder size exceeds $threshold_kb KB."
else
    echo "The folder size does not exceed $threshold_kb KB."
fi
```

### Explanation

1. **`du -sk`**: This command returns the total size of the folder in kilobytes.
2. **`awk '{print $1}'`**: This extracts the size value from the `du` output.
3. **Comparison**: The size is compared against the threshold using a conditional statement.

Both methods provide a quick and efficient way to check if a folder's size exceeds a specified threshold without fully calculating the total size.
