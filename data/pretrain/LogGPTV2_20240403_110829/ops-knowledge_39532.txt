I am trying to add Tesseract to my system so that I can install `pytesseract`. I am using Windows 7.

I added the following path to my `PATH` environment variable:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
```

However, when I run the following commands from the command line:
```sh
tesseract DMTX_screenshot.png out
```
or
```sh
tesseract
```
I receive the error message:
```
'tesseract' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
```

Here is a copy-paste of a portion of my `PATH` environment variable:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe;C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda\geckodriver.exe;
```

Do you have any ideas about what I might be doing wrong?

Thank you.

It looks like you are adding the executable file (`tesseract.exe`) directly to the `PATH` environment variable, rather than the folder containing the executable. To resolve this issue, you should add the folder path instead. Hereâ€™s how you can do it on Windows 7:

1. Open the **Control Panel**.
2. Go to **System and Security** > **System**.
3. Click on **Advanced system settings**.
4. In the System Properties window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.
5. In the Environment Variables window, find the `Path` variable in the **System variables** section and select it, then click **Edit**.
6. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click **New** and add the following path:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR
   ```
7. Click **OK** to close all the windows.

After making these changes, open a new Command Prompt window and try running the `tesseract` command again. It should now recognize the `tesseract` executable.

If you still encounter issues, make sure that the `tesseract` executable is present in the specified directory and that there are no typos in the path. Additionally, ensure that the `Path` variable does not contain any unnecessary entries, such as the `geckodriver.exe` file, which should be in its own directory and added separately if needed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
