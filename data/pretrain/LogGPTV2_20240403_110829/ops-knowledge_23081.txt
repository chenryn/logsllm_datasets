User: I had installed virtualenv on the system with python2.6.
I upgraded the system python to 2.7, but the virtualenv still has affinity for python2.6.
I tried easy_install --upgrade virtualenv, but that didn't change anything.
Does anyone know how to update the system installed virtualenv to use the new python2.7 on the system?
Assistant: You could try pip install -U python from within the virtual environment, not sure what it would break.
You could also change the symlinks that point to the old Python, but not sure what side effects that would have.
I would recommend the safest path, that is to first pip freeze > installed.txt and then recreate your virtualenv with your new Python and pip install -r installed.txt in it.
