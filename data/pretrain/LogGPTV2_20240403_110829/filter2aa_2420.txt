DISCLAIMER: The views and opinions expressed in this presentation are those of the presenter and do
not necessarily reflect the official policy, position of the National Cyber and Information Security
Agency of the Czech Republic, or any other government agency.
 Cyber and policy/OSINT specialist at the Czech National Security 
Authority/National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA) since August 
2016, with research focus on East Asia (military and security developments, 
APTs)
 Background in political science. Not even remotely close to be a technical 
expert.
 Worked in a foreign policy think-tank (experience with decision-making 
environment)
 Tried academic environment (and left it behind, which made both me and 
academia quite happy)
 Developed some knowledge of Chinese language (can order coffee in Starbucks 
and has a 50% chance to answer correctly YES/NO question)
 Above is not atypical personnel profile at the NCISA
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
 Central body of state administration for cyber security
 Mission(s)
 Operation of the government CERT team: GovCERT.CZ
 Cooperation with national & international CERT teams
 Coordination and implementation of the National Cyber Security 
Strategy and related Action Plan
 Protection of critical information infrastructure and other 
important systems (helping them to protect themselves)
 Preparation of exercises and education projects 
 Analysis and monitoring of cyber threats 
 International cooperation

 Outline of the institutional framework for 
cybersecurity in the Czech Republic
 Non-technical exercises and its relevance for 
decision making process
 Strategic analysis helps decision makers to 
understand cybersecurity

 Even relatively simple setup involves number of agencies 
across government sector
 There is a significant number of people that need to be 
well-informed, so they make the right decision in a timely 
fashion when the crisis comes.
 One way: cyber security exercises that simulate real-world 
possibilities
 Another way: strategic analysis
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
Policy and decision makers
 Strategic perspective
 Have direct (political) 
responsibility for policy 
decisions
 Need to take into 
considerations inputs from 
various directions, including
domestic and international law
 Do not always understand 
severity of a cyber security 
incident
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
Technical experts
 Operational/tactical 
perspective
 Specialists in their respective 
fields
 See decision making as slow, 
not corresponding to pressing 
needs
 Do not always communicate 
with decision makers in a 
mutually understandable 
manner
1. COMM-CHECKS
Testing existing/stated communication channels
2. STRATEGIC EXERCISES (incl. tabletops)
Real world-like scenarios, crisis simulation
We do customized TTXs for partners (e.g. U.S. Cyber Command, NATO ACT)
3. CRISIS MANAGEMENT EXEs (CMXs)
Specifically designed to test existing decision-making processes
4. TECHNICAL EXERCISES (Cyber ranges)
Simulated attacks, Red team Vs Blue team
5. HYBRID/FULL-SCALE EXEs 
Exercises involving technical and non-technical elements (not necessarily 
integrating them)
Provides link between technical teams and strategic perspective

 Coordinated by Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) based in Tallinn, 
Estonia
 Since 2010
 Participants in the exercise are NATO member states, NATO partner countries & NATO CIRC
team (possible Australian participation in future?)
 Four teams (up to 200 personnel] operate out of Tallinn, Estonia: 
 RED TEAM 
 GREEN TEAM (physical and online infrastructure)
 WHITE TEAM (scenario)
 YELLOW TEAM (operational awareness)
 BLUE TEAMS operate out of their respective countries
 19 blue teams took part in LS17
 Czech team participated in preparation and was involved in white, red and green teams
 Czech blue team: NCISA, CZ.NIC, MoD and others
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
 Blue teams assumed role of government CERT teams of a fictional 
country Berylia
 Red team assumed role of a fictional country Crimsonia that has a long-
standing dispute with Berylia and generally considers it as partr of its
influence sphere
 Target:
 Major air base
 Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles crucial for Berylia’s defense 
and domestic industry
 Fuel storage (SCADA systems)
 Blue teams were scored not only based on their ability to keep their 
systems operational, but also in terms of how they reacted to media 
AND legal queries 
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
 Based on the same scenario but included some extras: cyber attacks on elections 
that preceded the technical game scenario
 It was not strictly speaking strategic game because no high-ranked personnel was 
involved
 Blue teams had to consider their own legal/institutional frameworks and take 
decision their governments would take
 Few lessons:
 Legal aspects are important, especially if the conflict has international nature 
(international law, Tallinn Manual 2.0)
 The existing legal and institutional frameworks are often not ready to deal with 
effects of cyber attacks 
 It is relatively easy to overreact/underreact

 Tabletop exercise (tabletop version of technical CyberCzech exercise)
 scenario involved fictional countries of Pilsneria, its ally Brotherland, and 
Sauronia that declared “cyber war” on Pilsneria
 loosely based on civil war in Syria and European refugee crisis
 Events (and injects) involved:
 DDoS attacks, data theft, theft of laptop, ransomware attacks, attacks
on power grid, UAV hijacking…full menu, really
 Combination of cybersecurity incidents/attacks and physical domain
events
 6 teams: public servants, intelligence community and military, legal
team, decision-makers, private sector, media => NOT SIMULATED
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
Lessons learned included:
 Decision-makers hesitate to act
 Media communication is essential
 Need for greater emphasis on cyber hygiene (theft of laptop part 
of scenario, email habits exposed participants to spear-phishing)
 Technical and non-technical teams need to communicate clearly
with decision makers
 Greater emphasis on whole-of-society approach (e.g. MIL 
hesitated to cooperate with CIV)
 Briefings on strategic level are inadequate and mostly reactive
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
 OSINT-based (Open-Source Intelligence)
 Early warning system
 Risk prevention
 prevention of cyber threats and future attacks through context
analysis
 Information support during crisis situations
 Knowledge base build-up (collection of resources, own analytical 
production)
 Information sharing
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
 Combine open source and Government
CERT information (or in more general
terms: combine knowledge of technical
and non-technical teams)
 Not all strategic analysis at NCISA is a 
result of cooperation between OSINT 
team and GovCERT nor is there a need 
for it
 We know we can reach out to each 
other anytime
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
 Still relatively new
 ThreatConnect & DGI cooperation on an
exposure of Unit 78020 is a very good example
 Governments have the choice to outsource but 
for many reason they will often opt to do it in-
house
 The advantage is that the cooperation becomes 
institutionalized over time and not just ad 
hoc/project-based
 Strategic analysis informed by technical analysis 
supports good decision making 
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
 Confront decision makers with life-like situations
 Involves personnel that is typically not a part of a technical exercise
 Allows to employ scenarios that reflect real-life events: helps decision 
makers to go from abstract to practical aspects of cybersecurity 
incidents
 Demonstrate that events in cyberspace could lead to physical damage 
and/or exploit pre-existing division in society
 It is a learning lesson for all involved
 Principals lead by example if they take part (reality: they tend not to 
do it)
 Clarification of roles
 Networking
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
DRAFT - DO NOT QUOTE
 Much has been said about the role of exercises and strategic analysis 
and how they help to bridge communication between technicians 
and decision makers
 Not much has been said about people who are preparing exercises 
and relaying communication from technical/tactical to decision-
making/strategic level
 We are not superheroes who came to save the day, the process is a 
great learning experience for everyone involved and that includes us
