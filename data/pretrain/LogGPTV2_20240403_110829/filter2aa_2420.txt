#### About the Author

Michal Thim is a Cyber and Policy/OSINT Specialist at the Czech National Security Authority/National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA) since August 2016. His research focuses on East Asia, particularly military and security developments and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). With a background in political science, he is not a technical expert but has worked in a foreign policy think-tank and briefly in academia. He also has basic knowledge of Chinese, sufficient for simple interactions. This profile is typical of many NCISA personnel.

#### NCISA Overview

The NCISA is the central body of state administration for cybersecurity in the Czech Republic. Its key missions include:

- **Operation of the Government CERT Team (GovCERT.CZ)**
- **Cooperation with National and International CERT Teams**
- **Coordination and Implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy and Related Action Plan**
- **Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure and Other Important Systems**
- **Preparation of Exercises and Education Projects**
- **Analysis and Monitoring of Cyber Threats**
- **International Cooperation**

#### Institutional Framework for Cybersecurity in the Czech Republic

Cybersecurity involves multiple agencies across the government sector. Effective decision-making requires well-informed individuals who can act promptly during crises. Two key methods to achieve this are non-technical exercises and strategic analysis.

---

#### Policy and Decision Makers

- **Strategic Perspective:** They have direct political responsibility for policy decisions and must consider various inputs, including domestic and international law.
- **Challenges:** Often, they may not fully understand the severity of a cybersecurity incident.

---

#### Technical Experts

- **Operational/Tactical Perspective:** These specialists often view decision-making as slow and not aligned with urgent needs.
- **Challenges:** Communication between technical experts and decision makers can be unclear and mutually unintelligible.

---

#### Types of Exercises

1. **COMM-CHECKS:**
   - Testing existing and stated communication channels.

2. **STRATEGIC EXERCISES (including Tabletops):**
   - Simulating real-world scenarios and crisis situations.
   - Customized TTXs for partners such as U.S. Cyber Command and NATO ACT.

3. **CRISIS MANAGEMENT EXERCISES (CMXs):**
   - Designed to test existing decision-making processes.

4. **TECHNICAL EXERCISES (Cyber Ranges):**
   - Simulated attacks, Red team vs. Blue team.

5. **HYBRID/FULL-SCALE EXERCISES:**
   - Combining technical and non-technical elements, providing a link between technical teams and strategic perspectives.

#### Example: Locked Shields Exercise

- **Coordinated by:** Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, Estonia.
- **Participants:** NATO member states, NATO partner countries, and NATO CIRC team.
- **Teams:**
  - **Red Team:** Simulates the adversary.
  - **Green Team:** Manages physical and online infrastructure.
  - **White Team:** Develops the scenario.
  - **Yellow Team:** Provides operational awareness.
  - **Blue Teams:** Operate from their respective countries, with up to 200 personnel.

**Czech Participation:**
- The Czech team was involved in the preparation and participated in the White, Red, and Green teams.
- The Czech Blue Team included representatives from NCISA, CZ.NIC, and the Ministry of Defense (MoD).

**Scenario:**
- **Blue Teams:** Role-played as government CERT teams of a fictional country, Berylia.
- **Red Team:** Played the role of Crimsonia, a fictional country with a long-standing dispute with Berylia.
- **Targets:** Major air base, control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and fuel storage (SCADA systems).
- **Scoring:** Based on system operability and responses to media and legal queries.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Legal aspects are crucial, especially in international conflicts.
- Existing legal and institutional frameworks may be inadequate for handling cyber attack effects.
- Overreaction or underreaction is common.

#### Tabletop Exercise: CyberCzech

- **Scenario:** Involved fictional countries Pilsneria, its ally Brotherland, and Sauronia, which declared "cyber war" on Pilsneria.
- **Events:** DDoS attacks, data theft, ransomware, power grid attacks, UAV hijacking, and more.
- **Teams:** Public servants, intelligence community, military, legal team, decision-makers, private sector, and media.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Decision-makers hesitate to act.
- Media communication is essential.
- Greater emphasis on cyber hygiene is needed.
- Clear communication between technical and non-technical teams is crucial.
- A whole-of-society approach is necessary.
- Briefings at the strategic level are often inadequate and reactive.

---

#### Strategic Analysis

- **OSINT-Based (Open-Source Intelligence):**
  - Early warning system.
  - Risk prevention and context analysis.
  - Information support during crises.
  - Knowledge base build-up and information sharing.

- **Combining Open Source and GovCERT Information:**
  - Not all strategic analysis at NCISA results from cooperation between OSINT and GovCERT.
  - Institutionalized cooperation over time supports good decision-making.

- **Example:**
  - ThreatConnect & DGI cooperation on the exposure of Unit 78020.

---

#### Benefits of Non-Technical Exercises

- **Realistic Scenarios:** Confront decision-makers with life-like situations.
- **Involvement of Non-Technical Personnel:** Helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams.
- **Practical Application:** Translates abstract concepts into practical actions.
- **Demonstration of Physical Impact:** Shows how cyber events can lead to physical damage and societal division.
- **Learning Experience:** Beneficial for all participants.
- **Role Clarification and Networking:** Enhances understanding and collaboration.

---

#### Conclusion

Non-technical exercises and strategic analysis play a vital role in bridging the communication gap between technical experts and decision-makers. While much attention is given to these exercises, the people preparing them and facilitating communication are equally important. The process is a learning experience for everyone involved, including the facilitators.
