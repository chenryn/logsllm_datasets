  "Wake reason: RTC (Alarm)",  "As an engineer in the maintenance and operation domain, I can explain that the Wake reason: RTC (Alarm) is a log entry that indicates the cause behind a device waking up from sleep mode. RTC stands for Real Time Clock and is responsible for triggering the alarm. An RTC clock is an electronic device that keeps track of the current time and date, and it operates independently of the computer. When the RTC alarm goes off, it sends a signal to the computer's firmware, which then wakes the computer up. This is a common feature in laptops and other portable devices, which have deep sleep modes to conserve battery life. The RTC alarm is typically used for scheduled maintenance or wake-up times. Additionally, RTC can be set to a particular time for scheduled auto-startup of a computer system. This log entry is useful for troubleshooting why a computer or device woke up while it was supposed to be asleep."
