User: I am developing an application that will run on Linux to run fullscreen all the time (no menus or trays or anything will be visible).
The application is going to be developed in Python, not that that matters as far as the window manager, but what I am having a hard time with is choosing a window manager.
I need something with the smallest possible footprint, that will let me run a graphical Python app and have an mplayer window at the same time, at widescreen resolutions (widescreen, 16:10,16:9, etc).  Other than that, it doesn't need a lot of features, but the end footprint size is the most important thing I'll be looking at.
What window manager would you recommend?
EDIT: There won't be any interaction with the application needed.
Assistant: You probably meant window manager.  Display manages are KDM, GDM and the like.  Windoe managers, to name, GNOME, Xfce, KDE, ratpoison, fvwm, twm, blackbox are a few.  ratpoison gives full screen to the application that is in the foreground but demands heavy keyboard interaction (hence the name ratpoison) and no mouse interaction at all.
