recover
Recovers readable information from a bad or defective disk. This command reads a file, sector-by-sector, and recovers data from the good sectors. Data in bad sectors is lost. Because all data in bad sectors is lost when you recover a file, you should recover only one file at a time.
Bad sectors reported by the chkdsk command were marked as bad when your disk was prepared for operation. They pose no danger, and recover does not affect them.
Syntax
