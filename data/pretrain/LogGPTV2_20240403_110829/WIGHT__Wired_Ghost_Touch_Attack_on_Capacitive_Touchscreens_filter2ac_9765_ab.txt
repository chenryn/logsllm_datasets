Fig. 3. A typical capacitance sensing circuit. The capacitance
variation caused by a ﬁnger can be expressed as a voltage
output of the sensing circuit, which is further processed by
ADC and CPU for detecting the touch event.
schematic diagram of the sensing circuit in the capacitive
touchscreen consists of a few capacitors, a resistor, and a non-
inverting operational ampliﬁer that connected to the reference
voltage Vref [2], as shown in Fig. 3. Since the ampliﬁer has
the two properties: no current ﬂows into the inputs of the
ampliﬁer, and the voltages at the two inputs are the same, it
can be approximately treated as an extremely large resistor.
When an excitation signal is applied between the TX and RX
electrodes, a current ﬂows through the mutual capacitor Cm
and the feedback capacitor Cf b, and charges them. At the
end of excitation cycle, the charge at the feedback capacitor
Cf b determines the output voltages Vout [2], [19], [20]. When
a user touches the screen, the ﬁnger acts as an electrode
and forms capacitors with the TX and RX electrodes, and
we model them with an equivalent capacitor Ct in series
with Cm. Note that Ct is typically a negative value [16]. To
understand how Vout is determined, we borrow the idea of
loop analysis methods of electric circuits, and consider the
sensing circuit containing three-loop currents in parallel [16],
[21], the charging, transferring, and discharging loops.
(I) The charging loop. The goal of this loop is to gain
charges from the excitation signals. The charging loop current
ﬂows through the capacitor Cm and possibly Ct. When an
excitation signal is applied, the capacitors alternate between
charging and discharging status as the potentials of the exci-
tation signal alternate between positive and negative values.
The stored charge Qm over the capacitors can be formulated
as [18]:
N oT ouch : Qm = 2CmVex
F ingerT ouch : Qm = 2(Cm + Ct)Vex
(1)
(2)
(II) The transfer loop. The goal of this loop is to transfer
the charges gained by the charging loop to the feedback
circuit. This is designed to improve the precision of the touch
detection, as the transferred charges Qm are accumulated at
the feedback capacitor Cf b over multiple excitation pulses [2].
According to the law of charge conservation [2], [22], the
amount of charges gained from the charging loop equals to
the one transferred to Cf b, and in case of no touch we have
Qm = Qf b
2CmVex = Cf b(Vref − Vout)
(3)
(4)
where Qf b is the charge stored in the feedback circuit.

Subsequently,
the output of the sensing circuit Vout
is
proportional to the mutual capacitance Cm between TXs and
RXs [21] and is
N oT ouch : Vout = Vref − 2CmVex/Cf b
F ingerT ouch : Vout = Vref − 2(Cm + Ct)Vex/Cf b
(III) The discharge loop. This loop current ﬂows through
the feedback capacitor Cf b and the feedback resistor Rf b,
representing the situation that the charges accumulated over
the feedback capacitor are inevitably discharged.

3) Time-Interleaved Sensing Method: The time-interleaved
sensing method is widely adopted in mutual capacitive touch-
screens, whereby the excitation signals are applied to each TX
electrode sequentially in the round-robin style, e.g., each TX
electrode is scanned once in each scanning cycle, denoted by
Ttr [23], [24], [18], [25]. Fig. 4 illustrates the signal waveform
of excitation signals, charges at the feedback capacitors, and
the output of the sensing circuit in the time-interleaved sensing
method. (a) The excitation signal is a series of AC waveform
alternating between on and off. The signal is turned on for a
duration of Ttx to excite each TX electrode, and turned off for
an interval of Tin to prepare for the next TX electrode. It takes
a duration of Ttr to scan each TX once, and thus the touch
refresh rate 1/Ttr reﬂects how sensitive the touchscreen can
detect a touch event in terms of time, which is generally in the
range of 60 Hz to 200 Hz [19], [26]. For each TX electrode,
multiple cycles of AC signals are applied to improve the
signal-noise ratio (SNR) of touch identiﬁcation [19], and we
denote Tte to be the period of the AC signal, which typically
has the frequency in the range of 100 kHz to 500 kHz [26].
(b) The charge stored in the feedback capacitor exhibits a
form of staircases over time as a result of multiple cycles of
excitation [24]. (c) The output signal of the sensing circuit Vout
is a sequence of square pulses with a magnitude proportional
to the transferred charge. Note that if Vout is greater than Vth,
the touch event will be detected [19].
B. Electromagnetic Interference
Essentially, WIGHT induces ghost touches by injecting Elec-
tromagnetic Interference (EMI), which is an electrical noise
affecting the performance of electrical circuits [27], [28], [29].

Fig. 5. Schematic diagrams of common-mode EMI and

Injected over charging cables, such types of noises are con-
ducted EMI and propagate as a current via physical conductive
routes, e.g., power cables, parasitic capacitance, PCB circuits,
etc., as compared with its counterpart that is radiated over
the air (radiated EMI). Regardless of whether conducted or
radiated, any pairs of traces or wires on a printed circuit
board (PCB) can experience two types of noises: common-
mode (CM) EMI and differential-mode (DM) EMI [28], as
illustrated in Fig. 5. Since the key of a successful WIGHT
attack is CM-DM conversion [12], [30], [31], we introduce
DM and CM EMI below.
(a) Common-mode EMI: CM EMI is an electrical noise
exhibiting the same magnitude and polarity on two traces or
wires on a PCB. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), the CM EMI source
has a voltage of Vc and creates the CM noise ﬂows on both
lines in the same direction, and returned to the ground via
parasitic capacitance (i.e., a stray capacitor Cs) [27], [32],
[33]. Note that the CM current will not ﬂow through the load,
as the induced voltage difference between the load is 0 [29],
i.e., V1 − V2 = 0. Considering the load being the sensing
circuit, a CM EMI will not be able to affect the total power
supply of the sensing circuit, nor will it affect the output.
(b) Differential-mode EMI: DM EMI ﬂows through the
traces on a PCB in an opposite direction, i.e., through the load
and back out, as shown in Fig. 5(b). In terms of the DM EMI
source, the induced voltages on each wire are relative to the
GND potential, and the voltage difference between the load
equals to Vd, which is the voltage of the DM EMI source [28],
[32], [33]. Considering the load being the sensing circuit,
injecting a DM EMI will change the total power supply to
the sensing circuit and thus its output.
III. THREAT MODEL
The attacker’s goal is to manipulate the victim’s touchscreen
by injecting malicious signals into the victim device along the
USB charging cable. We make the following assumptions for
WIGHT attacks:
• No data connection: The victim device equipped with a
capacitive touchscreen is charged at a malicious charging
station via a charging cable. However, WIGHT does not
require the data access permission from the USB cable or
physical contact with the touchscreen, which is different
from previous work [34], [35], [36], [37].
• Attacker’s knowledge: The attacker knows the model of
the victim device and has done a prior study on the same
model before implementing the attack. The device model
can be obtained in various ways, e.g., spying through a
camera installed on the charging station.
• Attack setup: The attack device can be inside a malicious
charging station in public places, e.g., markets, hospitals,
etc., as shown in Fig. 1. The attacker can provide a normal
charging function before launching the attack. In addition,
the attacker may launch the attack remotely.
IV. PRINCIPLE OF WIGHT ATTACK
To understand the touchscreen misbehavior phenomenon
reported recently [3] and design WIGHT, we ﬁrst elaborate
on the underlying principles of injecting a noise signal into a
touchscreen module with noise ﬁlters inside, and then validate
the principle with both simulation and real-world experiments.
A. CM-DM Conversion in Asymmetric Circuits
1) How to Trigger a Ghost Touch: Human touches and
ghost touches are detected via two distinct causes, although in
both cases the output of the sensing circuit Vout appears to be
larger than a threshold value and the system concludes with
a touch being detected. For human touches, the capacitance
of the touchscreen is changed due to ﬁnger contacts, and
thus the output voltage Vout reﬂects the capacitance variation
proportionally according to the original design Eq. (6), where
the output signal Vout = Vref − 2(Cm + Ct)Vex/Cf b.
To comparison, the attacker cannot touch the screen and
cannot change the screen capacitance. Instead, she can affect
how the sensing circuit measures the capacitance changes and
change the output voltage Vout by disturbing the excitation
signals. To this end, the attacker can inject a noise signal
such that under the superposition of the noise signal and
the excitation signal, the deduced output signal is Vout =
Vref − 2Cm(Vex + Vdm)/Cf b, where Vdm is the magnitude of
the DM signal added to the sensing circuit.
2) How to Inject a DM Signal: Based on the aforemen-
tioned analysis, the key to generating ghost touches is to
inject a noise signal that can affect the output of the sensing
circuit, i.e., a DM signal. In practice, however, it is difﬁcult to
directly inject DM signals into electronic devices via charging
cables, as most commercial devices are equipped with power
management and ﬁlter circuits (e.g., DM noise ﬁlters, voltage
regulators [10], over-voltage protection circuits [38], etc.,) to
stabilize the power supply, eliminate noises, and protect the
device from electrical damage [39], [40].
To tackle the challenge, we propose a CM-DM conversion
strategy that injects a CM noise over the charging cable such
that the noise can penetrate the aforementioned ﬁlter circuits
inside the power management integrated circuit (PMIC) mod-
ule, and result in a DM noise [12], [30], [31] as the injected
signal propagates through the circuit.
CM-DM conversion strategy. Without loss of generality,
let Asin(2πf t) be a CM signal where A and f are the
magnitude and frequency of the signal respectively. Due to
the non-linear characteristics of the RLC series circuit [41], a

Fig. 6. Overview of the principle of WIGHT attack. Due to the asymmetric circuits in the touch controller, the CM signal
injected into the GND line will be converted into a DM signal that interferes with the capacitance measurement. Once the
output signal of the sensing circuit exceeds the threshold, the ghost touches will be detected.

the resistance of the circuit, where reactance X is related to
the inductors (L) and the capacitors (C), i.e., X = 2πf L −
1/(2πf C). As a result, the ﬁnal CM signal is:
Vcm = βAsin(2πf t + ϕ)
(9)
where ϕ is the phase and β is the magnitude decay rate.
In asymmetric circuits, e.g., the touch controller circuits in
a touchscreen device (discussed later [42]), the CM signal can
be converted into a desired DM signal. As shown in Fig. 6,
suppose the CM signal after the PMIC module is Vcm, the
phase and the magnitude of Vcm will change after it traverses
the touch controller circuits, and become the desired DM
signal and feed into the TX and the RX as inputs. The DM
signal can be denoted as

in Appendix C Eq. (20), Eq. (21)). After adding Vdm onto
the excitation signal, the DM signal can interfere with the
capacitance measurement to deduce the desired ghost touches.
3) Asymmetric circuits of touchscreens: The success of the
CM-DM conversion strategy relies on the assumption that a
touchscreen has asymmetric circuits inside and the CM signal
injected from the USB cable can ﬂow through the circuits. To
investigate, we look into the smartphone touchscreen circuits
and depict the key modules starting from the USB module to
the touchscreen in Fig. 6.
management function for the touch controller module. Then,
the touch controller module adopts a charge pump to generate
an elevated voltage for the sensing circuit [18] such that the
voltage magnitude feeding into the TX electrodes will be larger
than the one directly supplied by the battery [42]. As a result,
it reduces the impact of noises on the touchscreen. Finally, the
output voltage of the sensing circuit is digitized by the ADC
and processed by the CPU to detect touch events.
Analyzing the ﬂowing path of the Vcm signal, we ﬁnd that
the charge pump circuit inside the touch controller module
is asymmetric compared to the DC power supply circuit.
Speciﬁcally, the sub-circuits connected to the TX and RX
inputs have different nonlinear characteristics and therefore
attribute to different phase delays and magnitude decays.
B. Validation by Simulation and Real-world Experiments
To validate the aforementioned CM-DM conversion analy-
sis, we conducted experiments with simulation and real-world
experiments.
Simulation. The setup of the simulation experiment
is
shown in Fig. 7(a). We built an asymmetric circuit (top) as
well as a symmetric circuit (bottom). Two signal generators
and a multi-channel voltmeter are used to power the circuits
and monitor the output from both circuits, respectively. We
injected a sinusoidal CM signal with a frequency of 300 kHz
and root-mean-square (RMS) voltage of 106 V * into both
circuits. The output voltages of two circuits shown in the
voltmeter validate that the CM signal after the symmetric
circuit is 0 (blue line) and become a DM signal (red waveform)
in the asymmetric circuit. This experiment conﬁrmed that
asymmetric circuits can indeed induce a DM signal.
Touch panel experiment. In addition, we performed an
experiment on a commercial touch panel [43], [44] shown
in Fig. 7(b). We injected a CM signal from the GND line of the
capacitive touch panel and measured the potential difference
between the TX electrode and the RX electrode, i.e., the
excitation signal applied to the sensing circuit. To improve
the measurement accuracy, we utilized an oscilloscope with

screens used in our experiments.
