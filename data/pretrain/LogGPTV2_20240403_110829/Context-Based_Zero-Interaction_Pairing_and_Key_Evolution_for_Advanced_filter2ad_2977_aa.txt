ABSTRACT
Solutions for pairing devices without prior security associa-
tions typically require users to actively take part in the pair-
ing process of the devices. Scenarios involving new types of
devices like Internet-of-Things (IoT) appliances and wear-
able devices make it, however, desirable to be able to pair
users’ personal devices without user involvement.
In this paper, we present a new approach for secure zero-
interaction pairing suitable for IoT and wearable devices.
We primarily require pairing to happen between “correct”
devices – the devices that the user intends to pair. Our pair-
ing scheme identiﬁes the correct devices based on measuring
sustained co-presence over time. We do this by having the
devices compute a ﬁngerprint of their ambient context us-
ing information gathered through commonly available sensor
modalities like ambient noise and luminosity. We introduce
a novel robust and inexpensive approach for ﬁngerprinting
contexts over time. Co-present devices will observe roughly
similar context ﬁngerprints that we use in a key evolution
protocol to gradually increase the conﬁdence in the authen-
ticity of the correct devices. Our experiments show the ef-
fectiveness of this approach for zero-interaction pairing.

INTRODUCTION
Traditional approaches for key agreement between per-
sonal devices without any prior security association (also
known as “pairing”) typically rely on some form of active user
involvement to authenticate the key agreement. For exam-
ple, the user may be asked to compare authentication strings
displayed on the devices or to bring the devices close enough
so that they can communicate via a Near Field Communi-
cation channel [17]. Such measures are required to thwart
man-in-the middle attacks targeting the initial key agree-
ment. Relying on user involvement to authenticate pairing
is cumbersome, error-prone and does not scale well.
It is
therefore desirable to devise zero-interaction pairing mech-
anisms which do not require any user interaction.
In this paper, we consider the challenge of zero-interaction
pairing for two particularly important emerging classes of
personal devices: Internet-of-Things (IoT) appliances and
wearables. There has been an increasing interest in both
of these classes accompanied by a steady stream of prod-
uct announcements and media coverage.
IoT devices are
intelligent network-enabled appliances utilizing connectiv-
ity and local computation to enable richer functionality and
improved user experience. Examples of IoT devices include
Nest smoke detectors and thermostats [12], the Oral-B con-
nected toothbrush [13], the Bee+ smart injection tracker
for diabetic patients [21], and the Spotter smart home sen-
sor [14]. According to a recent Gartner forecast, the total
installed base of IoT devices will grow to 26 billion units by
2020 [8]. Such devices will therefore play a signiﬁcant role
in the future end-user computing infrastructures. Similarly,
new wearable devices include wristbands used for activity
monitoring (e.g., LG LifeBand Touch, POLAR Loop Ac-
tivity Tracker), augmented reality gadgets like the Google
Glass near-eye display device, smart watch devices (e.g.,
Samsung Galaxy Gear) and many more.
It is estimated
that by 2017, 50% of all smartphone app interactions will
involve wearable devices [7], emphasizing the important role
that wearables are expected to play in future smartphone
usage scenarios.
Both IoT devices and wearables process sensitive informa-
tion and critical operations. Thus securing their communi-
cations is essential. On the other hand, in both cases ordi-
nary users may own and manage many devices. The devices
themselves may not have any user interfaces. Therefore,
zero-interaction pairing will greatly improve the usability of
conﬁguring these devices.
The security goal of pairing personal devices is to en-
sure that the key agreement takes place between the de-
vices owned by the user.
In traditional pairing schemes,
users are required to demonstratively identify the correct
devices [1]. The requirement of zero-interaction, however,
rules out demonstrative identiﬁcation.
Existing pairing solutions that do not require direct user
involvement can be broadly divided into two classes: key
predistribution and context-based pairing approaches. Key
predistribution-based approaches (e.g., [6, 2, 10, 18]) are
mainly intended for digital sensor network (DSN) scenarios
and require key material to be distributed to all network
nodes before their deployment in the ﬁeld. In IoT scenar-
ios, however, such predistribution is not feasible due to the
overwhelmingly large number of devices deployed and the
fact that there are hundreds if not thousands of diﬀerent
device vendors that do not necessarily share any security
associations with each other. Furthermore, in our scenarios
multiple authentication domains may exist in overlapping
physical spaces, such as the IoT domains of two neighboring
apartments. Therefore the pairing solution must be capa-
ble of automatically distinguishing between such overlapping
domains.
Context-based pairing approaches (e.g., [20, 16]), on the
other hand, use co-presence of devices to identify the de-
vices to be paired. These schemes leverage the fact that
co-present devices will perceive roughly the same ambient
context via their on-board sensors – thus each device takes
a momentary snapshot of its ambient context using a given
sensor modality (e.g., acoustic or electromagnetic) and uses
the resulting “context ﬁngerprint” to authenticate key agree-
ment. Relying on a one-shot ﬁngerprint for zero-interaction
pairing has some drawbacks in the scenarios we consider.
First, to ensure security the context ﬁngerprint must have
suﬃcient entropy (e.g., 128 bits). This imposes strict re-
quirements on the ﬁngerprinting technique such as the need
for tight time synchronization between devices (as in [16]) or
access to low-level information like raw WiFi packets that is
typically not available to apps in commodity devices (as in
[20]). Second, momentary co-presence of two devices does
not always imply that the devices belong to the same user.
Our goal and contributions. In this paper, we present
a novel approach for zero-interaction pairing that is suit-
able for IoT and wearable device scenarios. Unlike previous
schemes, we identify correct devices based on the notion of
sustained co-presence: our scheme uses sensed context ﬁn-
gerprints to evolve the pairing key periodically in a way that
is only possible for devices co-present over extended periods
of time. This is based on the intuition that in the long run, a
user’s personal devices are much more likely to be co-present
with one another as compared to other users’ devices. We
use readily available context sensor modalities like audio and
luminosity. An initial (potentially insecure) pairing is grad-
ually strengthened using a key evolution approach that step-
by-step establishes and increases the authenticity of correct
peers, while making it increasingly diﬃcult for wrong de-
vices to maintain an authenticated pairing with the user’s
devices.
The context ﬁngerprints we use are based on observable
changes in the average luminosity and noise levels of the
devices’ ambient context over a longer time period. Use of
longer time periods implies that our ﬁngerprinting scheme
does not require tight time synchronization and is thus ro-
bust. Fingerprints are used to authenticate each key evolu-
tion step.
Our main contributions are the following:
• We describe a robust context-based shared en-
tropy extraction scheme for audio and luminosity
modalities and demonstrate its eﬀectiveness using real
context data (Section 4).
• We incorporate the entropy extraction into a novel key
evolution approach for automatically pairing personal
devices of the user (Section 3) and reason about its se-
curity (Section 5). The key evolution ensures that pair-
ing succeeds between devices that exhibit sustained co-
presence, which is typical for personal devices in IoT
and wearable device scenarios.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2,
we describe the context-based pairing scenario and problem
setting. In Sect. 3 we describe the key evolution approach,
which utilizes a ﬁngerprinting scheme presented and evalu-
ated in Sect. 4. An analysis of the security properties of our
approach is presented in Sect. 5. We conclude the paper with
a presentation of related work in Sect. 6 and a conclusion in
Sect. 7.
2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
We focus on the problem of pairing between two devices.
By ”pairing”, we mean the process of setting up a shared
security association (e.g., a shared symmetric key) between
the devices. Pairing must be established only between the
devices that the user intends to pair, i.e., devices belonging
to the same user. We refer to these as the correct peers.
Conversely devices owned by other users are wrong peers.
The security goal of pairing is to ensure that only a pairing
between correct peers is accepted as genuine. Our approach
is to develop a context-based pairing scheme to this end.
“Context” means here the ambient environment of a device.
A device can characterize its context by using context data
that can be sensed using on-board sensor modalities.
In
this paper, we use ambient audio (sensed by microphones)
and luminosity (sensed by lux sensors) for characterizing a
context.
We consider the pairing problem in two particular sce-
narios: a static setting primarily concerning IoT devices in-
stalled at the user’s home, and, a mobile setting for wearable
personal devices.
IoT Scenario. The IoT scenario is shown in Fig. 1. A
user has installed some IoT devices d1 and d2. Her neigh-
bor also has an IoT device A in his apartment. IoT devices
are typically equipped with WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity
and hence may be placed within each other’s communication
range. We can assume that all devices are able to communi-
cate with one another and are equipped with context sensors
to sense contextual parameters. Over time, the devices d1
and d2 in the user’s home should establish a secure pairing
between each other without user interaction, while making
sure that a trusted pairing is not erroneously established
with device A.

Wearable Scenario. The second scenario is concerned
with the secure pairing of personal wearable devices, as de-
picted in Fig. 2. The user has a smartphone d1 and buys a
smart watch d2, turns it on and starts using it. The newly
activated smart watch d2 actively searches for smartphones
nearby and establishes an initial pairing with all such de-
vices that it can ﬁnd nearby. Similarly d1 will accept any
initial pairing from any wearable device that contacts it.
In order to establish the authenticity of such initial pair-
ings, the two devices then attempt to evolve their pairing
key using a key evolution protocol during a gestation period.
If at the end of the gestation period the two devices have
suﬃcient conﬁdence in the authenticity of each other belong-
ing to the same domain, i.e., being owned by the same user,
they accept the pairing key as genuine. Otherwise, they dis-
card the pairing the key. If the wearable device d2 accepts
a key, it stops making new key pairing requests, since it is
already associated with the correct user’s smartphone. Also
in this scenario, we need to make sure that the pairing key
of a device A not belonging to the user is not erroneously
accepted as genuine.
2.1 Threat Model and Assumptions
The threat we are concerned with is that an adversary
device A succeeds in making a legitimate device d1 accept a
pairing with A as genuine.
IoT Scenario. In the IoT scenario, the adversary A is an
IoT device in the neighbor’s apartment. This device can be
benign, just trying to pair with other devices it can discover
in its proximity, or, malicious, if infected with malware, ag-
gressively trying to pair with and inﬁltrate any IoT networks
it can discover. The wrong peer A is permanently near de-
vice d1 and can communicate with it over a wireless link,
but it is not able to monitor d1’s ambient context, since it
is separated from it by a solid wall.
If the neighboring apartment where the wrong device A is
located has large windows facing the same direction as the
user’s apartment, A may have visibility to any changes in
the outside luminosity aﬀecting the lighting conditions in the
user’s apartment, but it is not able to directly observe the
lighting conditions in the ambient context of d1. Speciﬁcally,
A is not capable of mounting targeted attacks, i.e., attacks
that are executed by directly monitoring the target apart-
ment where d1 is located, e.g., from another apartment over
the street. Since A is assumed to be a regular IoT device,
it neither has the directional high-ﬁdelity sensors required
for monitoring a speciﬁc target over large distances nor the
functional logic for mounting such attacks.
Wearable Scenario. In the wearable device scenario, the
adversary A is either a malicious attacker trying to play a
man-in-the-middle attack on the user and his wearable de-
vice, in order to obtain sensitive information exchanged be-
tween them, or it could be just someone else’s device search-
ing for its own peer device. We assume that the wrong peer
A is from time to time present in the same context as d1,
e.g., while d1 is visiting a place where also A is located (cf.
Fig 2) and hence A can observe the same contextual pa-
rameters as d1. However, A is not able to follow the user
constantly. The amount of time A is able to monitor d1’s
context is therefore limited and signiﬁcantly smaller than
the time that d1 and d2 spend co-located in the same con-
texts. We follow a standard Dolev-Yao adversary model [4]
and assume that A has full control over all communication
channels.
