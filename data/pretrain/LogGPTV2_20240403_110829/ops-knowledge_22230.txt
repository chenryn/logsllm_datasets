User: How to conduct statistics and analysis of system resource utilization, and optimize the system through corresponding indicators?
Assistant: 1. Confirm the monitoring system: System resource utilization statistics and analysis need to be realized through a monitoring system first, and tools such as Zabbix, Nagios, Grafana, etc. can be selected. 2. Confirm the indicators that need to be monitored: For different systems, the indicators that need to be monitored may be different. For example, server resources need to monitor utilization indicators such as CPU, memory, disk, and network; database systems need to monitor indicators such as the number of connections, query time, and cache usage; web servers need to monitor indicators such as response time and the number of concurrent requests. 3. Statistics and analysis: After the required indicators are collected through the monitoring system, statistics and analysis can be performed. Data visualization tools such as Grafana can be used for visual display to analyze the difficulties and key points of system optimization. 4. Optimize the system: According to the analysis results, the system can be optimized. For example, for the problem of high CPU utilization, solutions such as optimizing program code, increasing server performance, or load balancing can be considered; for high memory utilization, solutions such as optimizing the cache strategy or separating applications can be considered. 5. Periodic inspection: System optimization is not a one-time job, and should be regularly inspected and optimized. The stability and continuous improvement of system performance can be ensured by setting alarm thresholds, regular inspections, and monitoring historical data.
