### Issue with Symfony\Component\Process

**Error Description:**
After running a long-running process, I encountered the following error:

```
A temporary file could not be opened to write the process output to. Verify that your TEMP environment variable is writable.
```

**Observations:**
- The issue appears to be related to a Windows-specific workaround in the `getDescriptors()` method.
- I discovered that approximately 65,000 temporary files were created in the Windows temp directory and were not being deleted.
- These files accumulate over time, requiring me to manually clear them out on a daily basis.

**Expected Behavior:**
PHP should automatically remove these temporary files, but they are not being deleted, leading to the accumulation.

**Steps Taken:**
- Manually clearing the temporary files from the Windows temp directory daily.

**Suggested Actions:**
- Investigate why the temporary files are not being removed by PHP.
- Consider implementing a more robust cleanup mechanism or increasing the frequency of manual cleanup.
- Ensure that the `TEMP` environment variable is correctly set and that the specified directory is writable.
