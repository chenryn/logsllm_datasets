Symfony\Component\Process  
I'm getting this error after running a process for a long time  
A temporary file could not be opened to write the process output to, verify
that your TEMP environment variable is writable  
Seems to be the windows workaround in getDescriptors()  
I found the problem to be 65,000 temp files created by this file in my windows
temp but not removed. I have to clear these out daily.  
PHP should remove the files but they slowly build up.
