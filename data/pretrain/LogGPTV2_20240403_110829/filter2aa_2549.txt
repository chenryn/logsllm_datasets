### What is PACS-Man?

#### Tools of the Trade
PACS-Man (Physical Access Control System - Man-in-the-Middle) is a framework designed to enhance and automate the process of testing and improving physical access control systems. This section outlines the tools and techniques used in the field.

### How Do We Improve the Experience in the Field?
**Automation!**
By automating various aspects of the testing and improvement process, we can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our efforts.

### Demo Time
A live demonstration will showcase the capabilities and potential of PACS-Man.

### Contribute to Odo!
Odo is an open-source framework that supports the development and deployment of PACS-Man. Contributions are welcome in the following areas:

- **Potential Credential Producers:**
  - BLEKey
  - ESP RFID Tool
  - Wiegotcha
  - Telephoto Lens + OCR

- **Potential Credential Consumers:**
  - Chameleon Mini
  - Libnfc
  - Emutag

- **Support for Alternate Displays / Hats:**
  - New Feedback and Control Mechanisms
  - Smart Watch Support
  - Android / iOS Apps
  - Haptic Feedback Vests

### Evolution of PACS
The evolution of Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) has led to the rise of mobile credentials as a new standard.

- **Mobile Credentials:**
  - **NFC:** Not supported by all smartphones and was heavily restricted on iOS until recently.
  - **BLE:** Nearly ubiquitous support across smartphones, although the protocol was not originally designed for this purpose.

### What Else Does This Add?
- **Diagnostic Capability:**
  - Firmware Upgrades
  - Reconfiguration

### Bluetooth Considerations
You might be wondering about the prevalence of readers. Let's explore the role of the nRF52 chip in these devices.

### Demo Time
Another live demonstration will highlight the features and capabilities of the nRF52 chip.

### Practical Impacts
- **Selective or Area-Wide Denial of Service:**
  - Disable access to key ingress/egress points such as turnstiles, security vestibules, and equipment rooms.
  - Annoy users by causing all readers to beep.
  - Engage DoS post-entry to evade security.
  - **Ghost Mode:** Slip a device into a target userâ€™s bag to DoS the two closest readers, making the user "invisible" to the system.

### Mitigations
- **Vendor Response:**
  - Working on upcoming firmware updates.
  - Currently requires the use of a mobile app at each reader.
  - Future updates via OSDP functions for supported hardware.

- **Short-Term Mitigation:**
  - Educate security staff and response teams.
  - Some customers may opt to disable BLE functionality.
  - Affected customers should reach out to their account manager for guidance.
  - Customers not using mobile credentials may inquire about ODSP-only backpacks.

This comprehensive approach ensures that PACS-Man remains a robust and effective tool for enhancing physical access control systems.
