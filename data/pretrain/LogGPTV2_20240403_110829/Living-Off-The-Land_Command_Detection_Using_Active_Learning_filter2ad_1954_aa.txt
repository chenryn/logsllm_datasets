## Abstract
In recent years, enterprises have faced increasingly sophisticated adversaries who employ creative methods to infiltrate and move laterally within their systems. One such method, known as "Living-Off-The-Land" (LOL) attacks, involves using legitimate tools already present on the system to hide malicious activities. These tools are typically part of the operating system or user-installed binaries, making them difficult to detect with traditional anti-virus solutions.

We propose an Active Learning framework called LOLAL (Living-Off-The-Land Active Learning) for detecting such attacks. LOLAL iteratively selects uncertain and anomalous samples for labeling by a human analyst, thereby improving the performance of machine learning models with limited labeled data. We explore word-embedding techniques to represent command-line text and design ensemble boosting classifiers to distinguish between malicious and benign commands. Our experiments, conducted on a large, anonymized dataset collected by an endpoint security product, demonstrate that our ensemble classifiers achieve an average F1 score of 96% in classifying different attack classes. The active learning method consistently improves classifier performance, converging in fewer than 30 iterations even when starting with a small number of labeled instances.

## 1 Introduction
As traditional anti-virus and endpoint security defenses improve at detecting file-based malware, advanced attackers are turning to alternative methods to remain undetected. One such method is the use of existing, legitimate tools installed on the target system. For example, `certutil.exe`, a Windows command-line program for certificate management, can also be used to download files from the internet and encode/decode certificates, allowing adversaries to download malicious files or hide existing ones. Such tools, often whitelisted and not flagged by security systems, enable attackers to evade detection. These types of attacks are referred to as "Living-Off-The-Land" (LOL) attacks, and the tools used are called LOLBINs.

The security community has observed a growing trend of attackers using LOL-based methods. Traditional anti-virus solutions are often ineffective against these tactics, necessitating the development of more advanced detection mechanisms. Current approaches, such as heuristic and regular expression matching, often result in high false positive rates due to the dual-use nature of these tools.

In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based approach to detect individual LOL commands. A key challenge is the scarcity of labeled data for training. To address this, we propose an active learning framework (LOLAL) that adaptively selects samples for analysts to label. Our framework uses an ensemble boosting classifier trained iteratively on labeled command lines to differentiate between malicious and benign commands. We employ a sampling strategy that identifies uncertain and anomalous samples, reducing the number of samples that need to be labeled by security analysts. We also utilize modern text embedding methods, such as word2vec and fastText, to provide a latent representation of the command line. Our experiments, conducted on a large, anonymized dataset from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, show that our ensemble classifier achieves an F1 score of 96% and that the active learning method converges in fewer than 30 iterations, reaching precision and recall above 97% for most classes.

**Contributions:**
- We propose an active learning framework for detecting LOL attacks on command-line datasets.
- We introduce novel command-line representations based on text embeddings and token scoring methods.
- We achieve an F1 score of 96% for an ensemble classifier trained on embedded command-line text.
- We demonstrate that our active learning method consistently improves classification performance and converges in fewer than 30 iterations.

## 2 Problem Definition and Background

### 2.1 Detecting LOL Attacks
Living-Off-The-Land (LOL) attacks leverage existing system tools to evade detection. These methods are used by both human adversaries and stealthy malware. Figure 1 provides an overview of traditional malware and LOL techniques. LOL techniques involve commands generated after an attacker has gained access to a command-line shell on the computer. Many tools used in LOL attacks are documented, and Table 1 lists some examples of how legitimate binaries can be misused.

| **LOLBIN** | **Example Malicious Command Line** | **Description** |
|------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `bitsadmin` | `bitsadmin /create 1 bitsadmin /addfile 1 https://foo.com/a.exe` | Download malicious files to a temporary location. |
| `certutil`  | `certutil -decode b64file newFile.exe` | Decode a Base64-encoded file into a malicious executable. |
| `regsvr32`  | `regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:file.sct scrobj.dll` | Execute scripts. |
| `msiexec`   | `msiexec /q /i http://192.168.83.2/cmd.jpeg` | Install and execute malicious code from remote servers. |
| `msbuild`   | `msbuild.exe pshell.xml` | Run obfuscated scripts directly in memory. |

These tools can be used for downloading and executing payloads, reconnaissance, and lateral movement. Traditional threat detection solutions are often ineffective against these tactics. In this work, we explore the use of machine learning, particularly active learning, to detect LOL attacks. A significant challenge is the limited availability of labeled data. Our approach leverages the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security product, which collects anonymized process telemetry reports, including command lines generated by computers running the product.

By focusing on single process creation events and their command-line text, we aim to detect new and known malicious patterns effectively. This approach simplifies the design and reduces the complexity of analyzing sequences of commands or scripts. Our methods can be extended to systems designed to process sequences of commands or scripts.

## 3 Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
We use a large, anonymized dataset collected by the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security product. The dataset includes process command lines from a subset of computers. User, computer, and organization names, as well as other sensitive data, are anonymized to protect user privacy. Professional security analysts labeled the processes as either malicious or benign based on their threat-hunting experience.

### 3.2 Feature Representation
We employ modern text embedding methods, such as word2vec and fastText, to create a latent representation of the command-line text. These embeddings capture the semantic and syntactic relationships between words, providing a rich feature space for machine learning models.

### 3.3 Model Training and Evaluation
We train an ensemble boosting classifier using the labeled command lines. The classifier is iteratively updated as more labeled data becomes available through the active learning process. We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as F1 score, precision, and recall. Our experiments show that the active learning method consistently improves the classifier's performance and converges in fewer than 30 iterations.

## 4 Experimental Results

### 4.1 Performance Metrics
Our ensemble classifier, trained on fastText embeddings and token score features, achieves an F1 score of 96% in identifying LOL attacks. The active learning method significantly reduces the number of samples that need to be labeled by security analysts while maintaining high precision and recall.

### 4.2 Convergence Analysis
We demonstrate that the active learning method converges in fewer than 30 iterations, even when starting with a small number of labeled examples. This convergence is consistent across multiple iterations, showing the feasibility of using active learning for discovering LOL attacks.

## 5 Conclusion
In this work, we propose an active learning framework, LOLAL, for detecting Living-Off-The-Land attacks. Our approach uses text embeddings and ensemble boosting classifiers to distinguish between malicious and benign command lines. Experiments on a large, anonymized dataset show that our method achieves high performance and converges quickly, making it a practical solution for real-world threat detection. Future work will focus on extending our approach to handle more complex scenarios and integrating it with existing security systems.
