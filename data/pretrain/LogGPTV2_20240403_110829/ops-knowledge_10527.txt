User: How to monitor the status and performance of containers, and handle container failures and exceptions in a timely manner?
Assistant: You can use container orchestration tools, such as Docker Compose, Kubernetes, etc., to monitor the status and performance of containers. These tools provide a visual interface that can display the running status and resource usage of containers in real time. In addition, an alarm mechanism can also be set to notify the administrator in time when a container fails or is abnormal. When dealing with container failures and exceptions, you first need to check the logs to understand the specific problem and try to solve the problem by restarting the container or repairing the application. When a problem is found, it is necessary to take timely measures to deal with it, so as not to affect the normal operation of the business.
