## Expected Behavior
The native browser `select` element allows you to move to options by typing
arbitrary characters when the select menu is open. The newly added `Select`
component (which is greatly appreciated by the way!) does not support this
functionality.
## Current Behavior
When select menu is open, and I type the label of an option that is not
selected, nothing happens.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Open a `Select` component
  2. Start typing to select an option
## Context
Material UI is an amazing asset, but in pursuit of the new and shiny, let's
not abandon something as fundamental as basic `select` functionality :)
