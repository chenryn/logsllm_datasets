**ATT&CK ID:** T0881  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Service Stop

Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users. This tactic can inhibit or prevent an effective response to an incident, thereby aiding the adversary in achieving their objectives. Additionally, stopping critical services can cause significant damage to the environment.

In some cases, services may not allow for the modification of their data stores while they are running. Adversaries may stop these services to facilitate data destruction, thereby further compromising the integrity and availability of the system.
