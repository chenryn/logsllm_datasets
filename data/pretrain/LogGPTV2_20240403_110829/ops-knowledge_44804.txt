User: What is the logic behind python requiring that a file be opened for write or append before being written to? Is there an advantage of doing this compared with something like bash which can just directly write to the file with something like: print 'Hello World' >> output.txt?
Assistant: Bash command is actually a small script or program, it's supposed to provide end to end operations. 
For programming, you'll use more basic unit operations (open, close, read, write, rewind, seek) than a set of operations (copy, delete). It's true both for Python, C, etc. 
If you go deeper into operating system coding, you will probably need operations to manipulate file representation details such as file handler and storage system. 
It's different level of abstraction for handle problems of different granularity.
