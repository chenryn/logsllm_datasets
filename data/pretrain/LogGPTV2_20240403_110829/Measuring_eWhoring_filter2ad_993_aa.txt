ABSTRACT
eWhoring is the term used by offenders to refer to a type of online
fraud in which cybersexual encounters are simulated for financial
gain. Perpetrators use social engineering techniques to impersonate
young women in online communities, e.g., chat or social network-
ing sites. They engage potential customers in conversation with the
aim of selling misleading sexual material ś mostly photographs and
interactive video shows ś illicitly compiled from third-party sites.
eWhoring is a popular topic in underground communities, with
forums acting as a gateway into offending. Users not only share
knowledge and tutorials, but also trade in goods and services, such
as packs of images and videos. In this paper, we present a process-
ing pipeline to quantitatively analyse various aspects of eWhoring.
Our pipeline integrates multiple tools to crawl, annotate, and clas-
sify material in a semi-automatic way. It builds in precautions to
safeguard against significant ethical issues, such as avoiding the
researchers’ exposure to pornographic material, and legal concerns,
which were justified as some of the images were classified as child
exploitation material. We use it to perform a longitudinal measure-
ment of eWhoring activities in 10 specialised underground forums
from 2008 to 2019. Our study focuses on three of the main eWhor-
ing components: (i) the acquisition and provenance of images; (ii)
the financial profits and monetisation techniques; and (iii) a social
network analysis of the offenders, including their relationships,
interests, and pathways before and after engaging in this fraud-
ulent activity. We provide recommendations, including potential
intervention approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION
Underground forums allow communities to trade illicit material
and share knowledge [9, 14, 15, 23, 39, 43]. These forums enable a
plethora of cybercrimes, allowing members to easily engage into
criminal activities. These include trading virtual items obtained
by illicit means, launching DDoS attacks using booter services, or
obtaining and using malware [26, 30]. The products and services
made available by forum members lower the barrier to entry, en-
abling those without highly technical skills to engage in deviant or
criminal activities [25].
eWhoring techniques have been actively developed since at least
2008. However, until recently the topic remained largely hidden
from academic attention. Earlier work [19] provides a qualitative
understanding of eWhoring, exploring how it works, how the actors
monetise their activities, and possible intervention approaches.
This qualitative approach allows us to understand what eWhoring
involves and informs the types of measurements we present here.
As with dating scams [7, 18, 29, 38], eWhoring involves social
engineering techniques. However, rather than simulating romantic
relationships, offenders imitate partners in cybersexual encounters.
Targets are asked for money in exchange for pictures, cam shows
or even sexual conversations (also known as sexting). Initial en-
gagement occurs through chat applications or dating sites. Packs
of multiple images and videos of the same person are traded within
underground forums. This material is the bait to lure customers
into paying for encounters. Underground forums are also used to
interchange knowledge and learn new techniques for increasing
the benefits obtained from this illicit business.
Contributions. In this work, we provide a quantitative analysis of
eWhoring. We start by providing an overview of the steps involved
in eWhoring (ğ2). In ğ3 we describe the data used for our research,
namely information gathered from the underground forums and
markets that serve as the basis for initiating, doing, and sharing

knowledge and material for eWhoring. We begin our measurements
(ğ4) by analysing the acquisition and provenance of images. In ğ5 we
estimate the income generated by eWhoring by analysing a subset
of forum posts where actors upload evidence of their earnings. In
ğ6, we investigate the roles and other interests of actors involved
in eWhoring. Related work is set out in ğ7. To conclude, we present
recommendations and potential disruption approaches and discuss
the limitations of our work in ğ8. The significant ethical and legal
risks that were considered when designing and undertaking this
research are detailed in the Appendix.
The main findings and contributions of this study are:
• We present a measurement pipeline for downloading, anno-
tating and classifying eWhoring-related material in a semi-
automatic way. As this study raises ethical and legal con-
cerns, our pipeline is designed to minimise exposure of re-
searchers to indecent images and enable early detection and
reporting of child abuse material. Thus, the pipeline can be
applied to research that involves downloading pornographic
or potentially illegal images.
• Using a dataset spanning more than 10 years, we perform
a longitudinal analysis focusing on three main aspects of
eWhoring:
(1) Provenance of images. We found 4k threads in under-
ground forums providing packs of images. From those
shared openly and for free, we downloaded around 115k
images from cloud storage services. We immediately re-
ported and removed from our servers the 36 images clas-
sified as child abuse material. Reverse image searches re-
vealed most were obtained from adult and pornographic
sites. We also found images stolen from social networking
sites, blogs, photo sharing sites, and online forums, among
others.
(2) Profits and monetisation techniques. We analysed 1 868
images posted by 661 actors, allegedly showing their eWhor-
ing earnings, accounting for a total of US$551k. The aver-
age reported income is US$774, with some actors reporting
more than US$20k. A typical trade of images costs between
US$5-50, whereas cam shows are sold for around US$200.
PayPal and Amazon Gift Cards are the most used pay-
ment platforms for monetising eWhoring. Some actors
also use underground forums for money laundering in
special boards aimed at currency exchange (e.g., selling
Amazon Gift Cards for BTC).
(3) Analysis of eWhoring actors. We analysed 73k actors
discussing eWhoring in underground forums. Most of
these (∼80%) made less than 10 posts whereas 2k actors
made more than 50 posts. We use social network analysis
to categorise the most popular and influencing actors, and
use forum activity to analyse other interests in addition
to eWhoring in a set of key actors. We find many actors
are initially attracted to the forum’s gaming and hacking
boards, before engaging in eWhoring.
• Based on our measurements, we provide a set of recommen-
dations and potential intervention approaches to disrupt
eWhoring.
• Finally, to make our work reproducible and to foster research
in this area, we release our code and part of the processed
data publicly: https://github.com/spastrana/ewhoring-analysis.
The forum dataset is available from the Cambridge Cyber-
crime Centre https://www.cambridgecybercrime.uk.
2 BACKGROUND
Previous research into eWhoring used a crime scripting approach,
analysing the tutorials and discussions posted on the underground
forum hackforums.net. These tutorials provide instructions about
how to get involved in eWhoring, and how to monetise this activ-
ity [19]. The crime script describes the steps involved in eWhoring,
from preparation to exchanging the illicitly obtained funds. In this
paper we will use the same terminology adopted in the previous
research. While not the terms used on the forums, ‘actor’ refers to
those engaging in eWhoring, ‘customer’ refers to those purchas-
ing, or potentially purchasing images, and ‘model’ refers to those
depicted in the images, with or without their consent.
Typically, images of models are stolen and shared online. Actors
provide advice about sourcing images from existing websites, in-
cluding pornography, social media, and ‘revenge porn’ sites. Actors
prefer a variety of images of the model, including clothed, nude,
and ‘verification templates’, which can be modified (e.g., to display
the customer’s name). Explicit video footage can be spliced to cre-
ate customisable interactive cam shows, referred to as ‘Video Cam
Whores’.
Actors create a unique backstory for each model, such as why
they are selling images, and open online accounts. These include
email accounts, as well as accounts for communicating (e.g., Skype),
accepting payment (usually PayPal or Amazon Gift Cards), and
for meeting and attracting customers. The types of websites and
applications used to meet customers include chatrooms, video chat,
social networks, amateur pornography, classifieds, dating, and on-
line gaming.
Depending on the site, actors will either openly post they are
selling photographs and cam shows, or will first start communi-
cating with potential customers before making an offer. At this
stage, there may be a process of negotiation and social engineering
before a price is agreed on, payment is received and the images
are sent. The final step in the process is retrieving the funds from
the account they have been deposited. In some cases this involves
converting currencies, such as exchanging Amazon Gift Cards for
cryptocurrencies.
There are alternative ways of generating income that deviate
from the standard eWhoring crime script. These include blackmail-
ing customers, affiliate marketing (e.g., providing images using URL
shorteners that first display advertisements), or infecting customers
with malware. Customers can also be scammed, with actors not
supplying the images they have paid for. Another scam type is ‘dou-
ble dipping’, where actors claim there was a problem with receiving
payment, and trick the customer into sending the money again.
Our previous work used content analysis methods to generate
the eWhoring crime script [19]. This qualitative approach provided
useful information about the processes involved in eWhoring, and
how this fraud is monetised. While this approach was not quantita-
tive, it provides insights into what would be useful to measure, and

the types of data available. In the following sections we quantify
where the images are being obtained from, the characteristics of
the actors (such as their other forum activity), and estimate their
earnings.
3 DATASET
This study relies on information gathered from underground fo-
rums. As in other web forums, users initiate conversations or threads
by writing an initial post and a heading which summarises the topic
of conversation. Other forum users can post in response to this
thread. The forums are made up of numerous boards, which contain
threads relating to specific topics.
We use the CrimeBB dataset [27] which contains data scraped
from 15 different underground forums, and is available from the
Cambridge Cybercrime Centre1. One of the forums is Hackforums,
the largest English-language underground forum. Hackforums has
been operating since 2005 and contains a board specifically for
eWhoring. Other forums, such as blackhatworld.com allegedly pro-
hibit conversations about eWhoring, since discussions about ‘un-
lawful activities, fraud, or deception’ [5] contravene their terms of
service. However, as shown in Table 1, forum administrators have
failed to remove such conversations.
To gather conversations related to eWhoring, we searched for
two specific keywords (i.e., ‘ewhor’ and ‘e-whor’) in the headings
of all the threads contained in CrimeBB, (comparison was done in
lowercase). Since the role of headings is to summarise what the
thread is about, eWhoring related threads will in most cases contain
either one of these two keywords. While some threads might be
missed, this in unlikely and our analysis should not be affected.
We also include all the threads from the specific board dedicated
to eWhoring in Hackforums (more than 36k threads at the time of
writing). Overall, our analysis leverages 44k threads and 626k posts
made in 10 underground forums by more than 72k actors. The data
spans more than 10 years of activities: the first post in the dataset
was made on November 2008 and the last on March 2019.
Table 1 shows the number of threads, posts, and actors that relate
to eWhoring for each forum. The largest eWhoring community
is found on Hackforums (which was expected since it contains a
dedicated section for eWhoring and is frequently referred from
other forums). OGUsers is a community focused on trading online
accounts with popular or interesting names. Here, we observe most
of the threads related to eWhoring are for trading chat-related
accounts (e.g., Snapchat or Kik) with feminine names.
Limitations. Using data from underground forums provides a sin-
gle picture of the landscape. These forums are platforms where
users initiate in deviant activities, such as eWhoring. They are also
used for sharing knowledge, tools and material required for such
activities. Thus, they are an interesting source of information, and
allow for analysing the material used for eWhoring (such as images
and packs), the earnings reported in the forums, and also the so-
cial network of forum actors. Also, we only rely on data publicly
available from forum conversations. For example, we neither use
information from private messages to build the social network, nor
analyse packs sold in the forums. Moreover, we do not analyse data
from platforms where eWhoring is actually carried out, such as

adult chats or social networks. Finally, we have not access to data
from endpoint payment platforms, such as Amazon or PayPal, and
thus our estimation of profits is based on data publicly reported by
actors. While this data could be deceptive, we believe this is unlikely
since, apart from bragging rights, there are few other incentives
to falsify the data. Thus, the results presented in this paper must
be seen as an initial approximation to this previously-unexplored
activity.
4 IMAGE PROVENANCE
One of the key requirements for successful eWhoring is to use a
good set of images and videos from the same model, known as
‘packs’. Good packs are those containing ‘unsaturated’ material, i.e.,
which have been barely or never used by others and thus are less
prone to raise the suspicions of the customer or be blocked from
the site being used to attract traffic. While some actors may create
their own packs, we observe ready-to-use packs are frequently
shared and sold in underground forums (indeed, we suspect the
tutorials providing information about how to monetise eWhoring
are designed to increase demand for these packs). These packs
contain images from the same (or visually similar) model at the
various steps of a ‘fake’ encounter, including dressed, nude and
sexual images and videos.
We are interested in analysing where these images are obtained
from and how they are shared between actors. We developed a
pipeline (see Figure 1) to analyse the images that takes into account
ethical and legal concerns (see Appendix). Using our pipeline, we: (1)
retrieve the packs shared in the forums; (2) download the images; (3)
filter out images related with child abuse; (4) automatically classify
images containing explicit, sexual, or nude content as ‘Not-Safe-
For-Viewing’ (NSFV), to avoid viewing them manually; and (5) use
a reverse image search to identify the domains where these images
have been obtained. In the following subsections we describe the
various steps involved in our pipeline, including the limitations and
results.
4.1 Extracting Threads Offering Packs
The first step in our pipeline is to identify those threads where
packs are offered, dubbed ‘Threads Offering Packs’ (TOPs). During
preliminary inspection of the dataset, we noted most TOPs provide
previews, i.e., one or more samples of the images contained in
