## Abstract
eWhoring is a form of online fraud where perpetrators use social engineering techniques to impersonate young women in online communities, such as chat rooms and social networking sites, to sell misleading sexual material (mostly photographs and interactive video shows) for financial gain. This activity is a popular topic in underground forums, which serve as gateways into the fraudulent behavior. These forums facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tutorials, and the trading of images and videos. In this paper, we present a processing pipeline to quantitatively analyze various aspects of eWhoring. Our pipeline integrates multiple tools for crawling, annotating, and classifying material in a semi-automatic manner, while addressing significant ethical and legal concerns, such as avoiding exposure to pornographic content and detecting child exploitation material. We use this pipeline to conduct a longitudinal study of eWhoring activities in 10 specialized underground forums from 2008 to 2019, focusing on three main components: (i) the acquisition and provenance of images, (ii) the financial profits and monetization techniques, and (iii) a social network analysis of the offenders, including their relationships, interests, and pathways before and after engaging in this fraudulent activity. We provide recommendations, including potential intervention approaches.

## 1 Introduction
Underground forums are platforms that enable the trade of illicit material and the sharing of knowledge, facilitating a wide range of cybercrimes. These forums lower the barrier to entry for individuals without advanced technical skills, allowing them to engage in criminal activities such as trading virtual items, launching DDoS attacks, and using malware. eWhoring, a type of online fraud involving simulated cybersexual encounters for financial gain, has been actively developed since at least 2008 but has received limited academic attention until recently. Previous work provides a qualitative understanding of eWhoring, including how it operates, how actors monetize their activities, and potential intervention approaches. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of eWhoring, focusing on the acquisition and provenance of images, the financial profits and monetization techniques, and a social network analysis of the offenders.

### Contributions
- We present a measurement pipeline for downloading, annotating, and classifying eWhoring-related material in a semi-automatic way, designed to minimize exposure to indecent images and detect child abuse material.
- Using a dataset spanning over 10 years, we perform a longitudinal analysis of eWhoring, focusing on the provenance of images, the profits and monetization techniques, and the roles and other interests of the actors involved.
- Based on our measurements, we provide a set of recommendations and potential intervention approaches to disrupt eWhoring.
- To foster further research, we release our code and part of the processed data publicly: https://github.com/spastrana/ewhoring-analysis. The forum dataset is available from the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre: https://www.cambridgecybercrime.uk.

## 2 Background
Previous research into eWhoring used a crime scripting approach, analyzing tutorials and discussions posted on the underground forum hackforums.net. These tutorials provide instructions on how to get involved in eWhoring and how to monetize the activity. The crime script describes the steps involved, from preparation to exchanging the illicitly obtained funds. In this paper, we adopt the same terminology: 'actor' refers to those engaging in eWhoring, 'customer' refers to those purchasing or potentially purchasing images, and 'model' refers to those depicted in the images, with or without their consent. Actors typically steal and share images of models, create backstories, and open online accounts to communicate with and attract customers. They use various websites and applications to meet customers and negotiate prices before sending the images. Alternative ways of generating income include blackmailing customers, affiliate marketing, and infecting customers with malware.

## 3 Dataset
This study relies on data gathered from underground forums, specifically the CrimeBB dataset, which contains information scraped from 15 different underground forums. We searched for threads related to eWhoring by looking for specific keywords ('ewhor' and 'e-whor') in thread headings. We also included all threads from the dedicated eWhoring board on Hackforums. Our analysis leverages 44k threads and 626k posts made in 10 underground forums by more than 72k actors, spanning over 10 years of activity.

### Limitations
Using data from underground forums provides a partial view of the landscape, as these forums are platforms for initiating deviant activities and sharing knowledge and materials. We only rely on publicly available data from forum conversations and do not analyze private messages, packs sold in forums, or data from platforms where eWhoring is carried out, such as adult chats or social networks. Additionally, we do not have access to data from payment platforms like Amazon or PayPal, so our estimation of profits is based on data reported by actors. While this data could be deceptive, we believe it is unlikely due to the lack of incentives to falsify the data.

## 4 Image Provenance
One of the key requirements for successful eWhoring is to use a good set of images and videos from the same model, known as 'packs'. Good packs contain 'unsaturated' material, which has been barely or never used by others, reducing the risk of raising customer suspicions or being blocked from the site. We developed a pipeline to analyze the images, taking into account ethical and legal concerns. The pipeline includes: (1) retrieving the packs shared in the forums, (2) downloading the images, (3) filtering out images related to child abuse, (4) automatically classifying explicit, sexual, or nude content as 'Not-Safe-For-Viewing' (NSFV), and (5) using reverse image search to identify the domains where these images were obtained.

### 4.1 Extracting Threads Offering Packs
The first step in our pipeline is to identify threads where packs are offered, dubbed 'Threads Offering Packs' (TOPs). During preliminary inspection, we noted that most TOPs provide previews, i.e., one or more samples of the images contained in the pack. We used specialized keywords to identify these threads, such as 'unsaturated' or 'pack'.

### 4.2 URL Extraction and Crawler
Using regular expressions, we extract URLs from the content of the threads. We then use a web crawler to download the images from these URLs. The next sections describe the various steps involved in our pipeline, including the limitations and results.

## Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a comprehensive analysis of eWhoring, a form of online fraud that has gained significant traction in underground forums. Our semi-automatic pipeline for analyzing eWhoring-related material addresses ethical and legal concerns while providing valuable insights into the acquisition and provenance of images, the financial profits and monetization techniques, and the social network of the offenders. We hope that our findings and the publicly released code and data will contribute to further research and the development of effective intervention strategies to combat eWhoring.
