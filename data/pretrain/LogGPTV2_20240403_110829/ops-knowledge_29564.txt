User: I installed the latest version of Python from www.python.org.  Python 3.4.3. I then go to run pip and I get 
"Fatal error in launcher: Job information querying failed"  
Searching for this error message points me to similar issues running Python under wine.  If you grab a pre-compiled pip.exe it will work but it seems that when you install, the pip.exe is generated as part of the installer and this pip.exe does not work.
Further I am dealing with a build script that creates a virtual python environment that uses pip.exe and results in the same error. Not sure how to fix this. Also not sure how pip.exe is generated.
Assistant: You can use python -m pip install package
