### Actual Behavior
Crashes when trying to load the module
### To Reproduce
I have put together 2 sample repositories to reproduce this bug. If there are
any problems following these steps I will happily fix any problems with them.
    $ mkdir electron_9_native_add_on_bug
    $ cd electron_9_native_add_on_bug
    $ git clone https://github.com/mastergberry/SimpleNativeAddon
    $ git clone https://github.com/mastergberry/SimpleElectronApp
    $ cd SimpleNativeAddon
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn build
    $ cp build/Release/SimpleNativeAddon.node ../SimpleElectronApp/app/
    $ cd ../SimpleElectronApp
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn dev
These steps above should start the application and then have it crash on boot.
So far I have reproduced this on Windows and macOS, have not tried Linux yet.

My guess is it has something to do with the flags that cmake-js uses to
compile versus node-gyp. From my testing disabling the inline functions on
Windows is a temporary workaround...but this is a hacky solution. Hoping that
there is a core issue that can be resolved here.
