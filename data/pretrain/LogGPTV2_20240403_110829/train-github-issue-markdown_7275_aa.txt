### Issue Details
- **Electron Version:**
  - 9.2.1
- **Operating System:**
  - macOS 10.14.6
- **Last Known Working Electron Version:**
  - 8.5.0

### Expected Behavior
The application should not crash when attempting to load the module.

### Actual Behavior
The application crashes when trying to load the module.

### Steps to Reproduce
I have created two sample repositories to reproduce this bug. If you encounter any issues following these steps, please let me know, and I will address them.

1. Create a new directory:
   ```sh
   $ mkdir electron_9_native_add_on_bug
   $ cd electron_9_native_add_on_bug
   ```

2. Clone the sample repositories:
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/mastergberry/SimpleNativeAddon
   $ git clone https://github.com/mastergberry/SimpleElectronApp
   ```

3. Build the native add-on:
   ```sh
   $ cd SimpleNativeAddon
   $ yarn install
   $ yarn build
   $ cp build/Release/SimpleNativeAddon.node ../SimpleElectronApp/app/
   ```

4. Start the Electron application:
   ```sh
   $ cd ../SimpleElectronApp
   $ yarn install
   $ yarn dev
   ```

Following these steps should start the application, which will then crash on boot. I have reproduced this issue on both Windows and macOS, but I have not tested it on Linux yet.

### Additional Information
Based on my testing, it seems the issue might be related to the compilation flags used by `cmake-js` compared to `node-gyp`. Disabling inline functions on Windows is a temporary workaround, but this is not an ideal solution. I hope there is a core issue that can be resolved here.
