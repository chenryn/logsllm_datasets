If you click once, and all checks pass green, then it should auto submit. As
it is, you're clicking once to check all tasks, clicking again to initiate the
submit window, waiting for the popup animation, then clicking "Submit",
waiting for animations, then loading to next lesson. 3 clicks and a 4-6 second
delay between each lesson. On the HTML section, that's 4.6-6.9 minutes of
completely dead time, and 207 mouse clicks instead of 69. I suppose I could
try to fix it myself, but I just started the course :P.
