of study. The target population – public managers 
– stem from both large and small organizations, 
from national government, from local (city) level and 
from institutions. They are from Denmark, Finland, 
the United Kingdom, the USA and Australia, covering 
eleven managers. The interviews have been largely 
open, following a loosely structured interview guide 
which as its main component asks the open question: 
“Please share your own story of how the design project(s) 
unfolded, and how this made a difference to you as a 
manager, if at all.”
This article builds on three particular stories from 
public managers, which are in line with the broader 
patterns in the interview material, and which give 
some more vivid illustrations of key aspects of design-
led innovation and co-production.

4. REDEFINING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH CITIZENS
Christina Pawsø is a social worker and manager of 
Camillagaarden, an institution in the city of Odense 
in Denmark which provides a sheltered working 
environment for adult mentally disabled persons. 
In reflecting on the current relationship between 
government organizations and citizens, Pawsø says 
that in her experience, it is designed around top down 
decision-making and implementation. Citizens, and 
in particular “vulnerable” people such as adults with 
a mental disability, are often perceived, and cast, as 
passive recipients of public services. 
There is [an image of] a staircase that goes up 
a hill with tiles, and it is very well constructed. 
... And then beside the fine staircase there is 
a muddy path that people walk by. And it was 
a bit like what happened here. ... it is a really 
good picture of how our users actually went 
by a different path than the one we wanted 
them to walk on. And so, instead of trying to 
get them forced onto our path, we will have 
to follow them. It worked well for us to have 
that picture.
Using the metaphor of the staircase versus the 
muddy path, Christina Pawsø explains how public 
employees and professionals have knowledge about 
how to operate in the system (bureaucracy, hierarchy, 
paperwork, procedures, ‘helping’), while citizens 
have knowledge about what motivates and engages 
them in their everyday life context (relationships, 
experiences, meaningfulness). Pawsø points out that 
both sides of this equation have their own knowledge 
– but it is a knowledge that isn’t necessarily being 
shared.
At Camillagaarden, this used to be the case even 
though the manager and staff work very closely with 
the users. Services were 
organized around one-
way communication 
that missed out 
on feedback loops 
and that did not 
appreciate the 
potential in the 
everyday interactions 
between staff and 
citizens. In this respect 
xii
it perpetuated a relationship that was inefficient. In 
Pawsø’s words, the staff attitude was roughly “We 
come [to work] and we must pass the time until we 
go home”. The key challenge faced by Christina Pawsø, 
who stepped in as a young new manager, was how 
to change such an attitude, to create a more fruitful 
relationship between staff and users, and generate 
better outcomes.
4.1 A different dialogue
Starting in 2008, Christina Pawsø and her colleagues 
hired a professional design team to facilitate a 
different kind of dialogue between management, staff 
and the citizen-users. In a joint project with Local 
Government Denmark (an interest organization for 
municipalities) and the service design firm ‘1508’, the 
managers and staff at Camillagaarden were trained 
to apply design approaches such as cultural probes, 
photo diaries, prototypes, service analogies, testing 
and ideation to explore new ways of involving and 
engaging citizens. Through the year-long use of design 
in Camillagaarden, Christina Pawsø and her staff 
began to build a different kind of relationship with the 
users. The highly interactive methods allowed citizens 
to visually articulate their hopes, dreams, aspirations 
and concrete personal stories about what a good 
experience at Camillagaarden was about, and how it 
could be made better. The staff built on these inputs 
to fundamentally redefine their professional role 
from experts to coaches and facilitators. According to 
Pawsø, this reflected a realization that “we are no more 
experts at something than they are”.
The citizens are now actively involved as innovators, 
coming up with new ideas every day, and driving the 
formation of various interest groups that pursue the 
activities and services they find the most fun and 
rewarding. User satisfaction and everyday engagement 
has skyrocketed and the number of users has gone up 
by nearly 30 percent (without additional staffing), to 
the point that the institution now has a waiting list for 
the first time in its 40-year history.
The shift has thus been towards a much more 
reciprocal, mutual relationship where staff sees its 
role as a collaborative one. The everyday work is about 
shaping outcomes, such as quality of life, in real-time. 
An example of how this changed relationship works in 
practice at Camillagaarden concerns a group of citizen-
users who once were thought of as a disruption, or 
trouble makers. They were labelled by staff as the 
‘corridor runners’, because they preferred to spend 
time roving around the corridors and hallways of the 
institution, rather than engage in activities with the 
other users. As part of the design process, this group 
was also involved, and the engagement challenged 
the staff to re-think how to make group sessions more 
interesting for everyone. Pawsø says of the ‘corridor 
runners’: “They did not bother to be in the groups, 
because it was boring, so they ran out in the corridors. 
This was always the case for maybe 20% of the users. 
But where we previously had said, how do we get 
them to stay in the group, now we think, ‘well what is 
it that is so exciting out in the corridor? We managed 
to turn the perspective in that way.” As a consequence, 
Camillagaarden now has no corridor runners, but 
rather a broader range of activities, including physical 
activities which appeal to those who are too restless 
to work on hand crafts all day.
4.2 Shifting the relationship
In their 1994 book Designing Interactive Strategy, 
Normann & Ramirez argue that there are three types 
of relationships in systems of value-creating actors – 
such as the system of an institution for adult mentally 
handicapped, or one for dealing with families at risk, or 
a school: ‘Pooled relationships’, in which each part of 
a system comes together to form a whole; ‘Sequential 
relationships’ where sections of an organizational 
system produce outputs to a sequential process; 
and finally ‘reciprocal’ relationships, which are the 
most complex and which in reality characterize most 
service-producing organizations. 
It seems reasonable to argue that the changes in the 
perception of the relationship between end users 
(adult mentally disabled persons) and public service 
organizations can be characterized as a shift toward 
recognizing that essentially, the relationship is (or 
should be) a reciprocal one. Normann & Ramirez 
(1994:30) state that “Co-production is the term we 
use to describe the ‘reciprocal’ relationships between 
actors...”, and they elaborate that this view implies that 
the customer (or citizen) is not only a passive orderer/
buyer/user of the offering, but also participates in many 
other ways in consuming it, for instance in its delivery. 
In section below I take a closer look at another way 
in which design seems to redefine what it means to 
“produce” a public service.
5. MOVING TO OUTCOMES
Anne Lind was until the end of 2012 the Director of 
the Board of Industrial Injuries (BII) in Denmark. She 
explains how she had the sense that something in her 
organization needed to change, although she could 
not be precise about what it was:
It is an eye opener ... it is more concrete. [The 
design process] has made me aware that 
there are some things we have to look at. ... 
So far we have been describing a service to 
citizens, not giving them one.
To Ms. Lind, leveraging design approaches 
to better see how her organization’s 
services impact citizens, has been ”a shift in 
perspective”.
The Board of Industrial Injuries is a government agency 
in Denmark and part of the Ministry of Employment. 
The responsibility of BII is to handle worker’s injury 
claims and ensure that the case management is legally 
correct, so that insurance settlements (which are 
generally paid by private insurers) accurately reflect 
the degree to which citizens have lost their ability 
to work. It has also historically been a key emphasis 
in the organization to ensure highly efficient case 
management. Tools such as lean management, team-
based work and performance-based remuneration, 
and the introduction of digital systems in case and 
workflow management, have been used extensively in 
BII’s pursuit of increased productivity.
Meanwhile, in the period 2007-2012, BII collaborated 
with various designers, including MindLab, a 
government-run innovation unit that is part of 
amongst others the Ministry of Employment, and 
Creuna, a private service design firm, to explore how 
its services are experienced by citizens. The methods 
included ethnographic field research (contextual 
citizen interviews recorded on video and audio) as well 
as numerous workshops with staff and management, 
development of personas to represent a range of ideal-
typical users, and seminars and conferences where 
various insights and results from the design projects 
were shared internally amongst staff and externally 
amongst stakeholders such as local government, trade 
unions, insurance firms, health care organizations, etc.
The quote above concerning a shift in perspective 
reflects a questioning by Ms Anne Lind, the Director: 
xiii
What is the ultimate contribution of an organization 
such as the BII? Is it to efficiently handle the case 
process to settle insurance claims and payment in 
accordance with legal standards, or is it to produce 
some kind of longer-term outcome for citizens and 
society?
5.1 Managing a strategic shift
Through the design process, Anne Lind initiated a 
strategic shift in her organization, from focusing 
mainly on handling insurance settlements, to helping 
people return to the labour market. Amongst the 
“One could argue that the 
previous mode of problem-
solving did not simplify the 
service production process, 
but made it even more 
complex for both the system 
and for users, without 
addressing the real question 
of how better outcomes are 
created.”
initiatives to underpin this change has been the 
strengthening of a “travel team” which works with 
local governments to quickly settle cases and 
rehabilitate injured workers back into work; improved 
online digital services that enable citizens to track 
their case progress; and a newly established Citizen 
Service Centre which will provide a more individually 
tailored and comprehensive service, starting 
with citizen’s needs. The underlying movement 
shifts the attention of the BII from focusing on 
producing processes (correct case management) to 
producing outcomes (return to labour market). Flowing 
from the experience of the highly user-oriented 
design work, Ms. Lind’s organization now focuses on 
leveraging a wide range of external resources to help 
injured workers get re-trained and find a job again.
Seeing how outcomes concretely are manifested from 
the point of view of citizens has been a key starting 
xiv
point, and an emotional driver of this change. Some of 
the first interviews with citizens, which were video-
filmed in their own homes, were, according to Lind, 
of great significance. To staff, it was almost shocking 
to learn that although their case management 
was perhaps legally correct, citizens experienced it 
as confusing, bureaucratic, and sometimes nearly 
meaningless. A universal finding seemed to be that 
the overwhelming amount of paperwork tended to 
get people caught up in the work injury process to the 
extent they felt they were the work injury. As a result, 
the case management process in some instances 
made people more ill than they were already. ”It has 
been good, but it has been tough”, is how Anne Lind 
characterizes the process. At first, the staff needed a lot 
of attention from her, simply because of the emotional 
challenge of realising that their work was in some 
cases doing more harm than good. This substantially 
challenged their world view.
In terms of methodology, using such qualitative 
research was a major departure from past practices, 
and one which allowed the organization to design 
different responses. According to Lind, the main 
research method had previously been quantitative 
satisfaction surveys. ”When we made a user survey 
we made a nice action plan to follow up ... we then 
piled additional information onto the users.” One could 
argue that the previous mode of problem-solving 
did not simplify the service production process, but 
made it even more complex for both the system and 
for users, without addressing the real question of how 
better outcomes are created. As a consequence there 
was a real risk that citizens were cast in a role as 
passive recipients, while the system was attempting to 
become ever-more efficient at a process that created 
dysfunctional outcomes.
As discussed above, professionals have difficulty 
understanding why users do not go through their 
process correctly; but users have stalls, missteps, quits 
and complaints because the process does not consider 
the contexts, complexities and subjective experience 
of their lives. This in turn further slows down the 
process and creates more work for the professional. 
Users feel annoyed, dissatisfied, demoralized, bored, 
let down by the process. In the case of BIIs work, 
the design approaches helped Anne Lind and her 
organization flip assumptions on their head. Seeing 
how the process was dysfunctional from an outcome 
perspective, the underlying assumptions in the 
business model were challenged. The agency began to 
ask questions such as: What is best for the users? What 
do they need? What is the purpose of this service? 
How might we be more preventative? At BII, this has 
also led to a comprehensive review of which resources 
are really available in the system, including in the 
health care institutions, in local government, and 
in insurance companies. By focusing on the desired 
outcomes, the Board has launched a dialogue with 
these stakeholders about how to help users make a 
better life based on what best suits their situation.
5.2 Creating outcomes through value constellations
As public managers leverage design to see for 
themselves how outcomes are created in practice, they 
begin to ask questions about the underlying purpose 
of their organizations. They start rethinking how value 
is created. The outside-in view of user experience that 
is provided by design exposes the entire network of 
actors, including citizens. who can potentially take part 
in value-creation. Normann & Ramirez characterize 
this as a process of reconfiguring, so that actors come 
together to co-produce value via what they call not a 
value chain, but a ‘value constellation’.
In the case of BII, the design projects helped Anne 
Lind see how her organization can work systematically 
to re-align a range of actors such as other authorities, 
health care providers, and insurers, to produce more 
value with citizens. For instance, this could lead 
to insurance agencies to invest actively in their 
customers/the citizen’s rehabilitation (physical 
training, therapy, etc.). Ultimately, this allows for 
a much more coordinated way of helping citizens 
back to the labor market: the ultimate outcome of 
the agency’s work. In the terminology of Normann 
& Ramirez, this is “an effective offering”, and it is 
“designed in such a way so that partners end up 
performing the ‘right’ activities for them, engendering 
value creation on both sides, or rather all, sides”.23
6. RADICAL EFFICIENCY?
Sune Knudsen is Head of Division at the Danish 
Business Authority (DBA). In 2010-11 he led an 
ambitious design project that aimed at making it 
easier to register a new business in Denmark. In 
describing the business case for a new solution that 
23   1994, p. 54
was co-designed with small business owners in a 
range of industries, Knudsen says:
If we succeed with this [..,] businesses will 
save a lot of money, they will be more 
satisfied, you will get higher efficiency of 
regulation, and the public sector will also save 
money.
