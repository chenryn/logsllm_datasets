Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the template extraction:

**Template:**
```
ciod: duplicate canonical-rank <canonical-rank> to logical-rank <logical-rank> mapping at line <line-number> of node map file <file-path>
```

**Explanation:**
- `<canonical-rank>`: The rank in the canonical order (e.g., 31).
- `<logical-rank>`: The rank in the logical order (e.g., 0).
- `<line-number>`: The line number in the node map file where the mapping is defined (e.g., 3).
- `<file-path>`: The path to the node map file (e.g., `/p/gb2/pakin1/sweep3d-5x5x400-10mk-3mmi-1024pes-sweep/sweep.map`).

This template can be used to identify and extract the relevant information from similar log lines.
