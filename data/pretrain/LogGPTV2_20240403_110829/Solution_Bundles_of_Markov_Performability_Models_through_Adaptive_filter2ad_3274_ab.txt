### Methods for Accurate Measure Evaluation and Approximation

To evaluate measures accurately on a (small) set of points, it is necessary to fine-tune a pre-defined set of approximation functions (called approximants). These approximants, when combined, define continuous approximations of the measures. In this paper, the Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) technique is adapted to approximate performability measure bundles, which are defined on solution bundles of the Kolmogorov forward equation that characterizes Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs).

#### Key Features of ACA
- **Separable Approximants**: Each approximant in ACA is the product of functions that depend only on time or on a single parameter.
- **Arbitrary Accuracy**: The arbitrary accuracy of the technique has been proven in [9].

### Main Contribution
The primary contribution of this paper is the development of an efficient and accurate method to evaluate performability measures along fibers, leveraging the separable approximants feature of ACA. This method works well under the assumption that the dependencies of the model on parameters are smooth functions (i.e., have continuous derivatives up to a reasonably high order). The proposed technique can be seen as a generalization of the semi-symbolic solution method presented in [7], with details provided in Sections IV-D and IV-E.

### Interpretable AI
From the perspective of Approximation Theory and Machine Learning, the presented approach can be classified as Interpretable AI (IAI) [10]. This is because separable approximants promote decomposability, a key aspect of IAI.

## Context and Contribution

### Models and Measures of Interest
- **Models**: CTMCs with state-space \( S \) and infinitesimal generator matrix \( Q(\theta) \), where \( \theta \in \mathbb{R}^p \) is the parameter vector.
- **Measures**: Performability measures, such as dependability, performance, and performability indicators, are defined in terms of moments of random variables.

### Problem Characterization and Contribution
- **Parameters as Variables**: Parameters \( \theta \) are treated as independent variables rather than constants, leading to a set of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) \( F(x(t, \theta), \theta) = 0 \).
- **Measure Bundle**: The solution bundle \( x(t, \theta) \) defines the measure bundle \( m(x(t, \theta), t, \theta) \).
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Local and global sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, parameter estimation, and optimization can all be expressed in terms of \( m \).

### Issues and Solutions
- **Infeasibility of Closed Formulas**: For large models, fully symbolic evaluation of \( m \) is unfeasible.
- **Semi-Symbolic Methods**: Treat only time symbolically, which is restrictive.
- **Fully-Numeric Methods**: Computationally expensive due to the need to construct a full tensor.
- **Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA)**: Adapted to define \( \hat{m}(t, \theta) \) as a sum of separable approximations, making the method interpretable and efficient.

### Dependencies on Parameters
- **Types of Functions**: Linear, quadratic, and reciprocal functions often appear in the entries of \( Q(\theta) \).
- **Smoothness**: The smoothness of \( Q(\theta) \) ensures that the measure approximation \( \hat{m} \) is cheap to evaluate and store.

## Choice of Evaluation Points

The proposed method evaluates the measures of interest at a discrete set of times \( t(i) \) and prescribed values for the parameters \( \theta_j \) for \( j = 1, \ldots, p \).

- **Time Variable**: Often evaluated at a uniform grid on the interval \([0, t_{\text{max}}]\), where \( t_{\text{max}} \) is the system mission time.
- **Parameter Values**: If the values of interest for the parameters are known a priori, these values are chosen for discretization. A small subset of these points is used for the approximation.

This structured and detailed approach ensures clarity, coherence, and professionalism in the presentation of the research.
