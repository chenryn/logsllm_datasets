Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common type of solid tumour in infants Currently there are no reliable biomarkers identified predicting disease 
outcome in patients within the high-risk group highlighting the acute need for novel therapies Indisulam (E7070) an aryl sulphonamide, a carbonic 
anhydrase IX (CAIX) inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of patients with solid tumours has recently been connected with pre-mRNA 
splicing factor RNA binding protein 39 (RBM39) Recruitment of RBM39 by indisulam to the DCAF15/CUL4/E3 complex promotes proteasomal degradation 
These findings connect cancer cell line sensitivity to indisulam with stability of RBM39 and high expression of DCAF15 Our data confirmed sensitivity of 
IMR32 human NB cells to indisulam both in vitro and in vivo In IMR32, the DCAF15 dependent RBM39 degradation and mis-splicing were necessary, but 
not sufficient for the full cytotoxic response to indisulam Using LC-MS and GC-MS metabolomics analysis together with stable isotope labelling we have 
identified the activity of indisulam to be associated with alterations in metabolite pools connected with NADH production and changes in redox balance 
Furthermore, as mitochondrial respiration was also impaired after indisulam treatment, these metabolic alterations observed imply that neither CAIX nor 
RBM39 are the sole targets of indisulam Overall, these results provide insights into the contribution of metabolism to the mechanism of action of indisulam 
and suggest that metabolic subtypes of tumours may respond differently to therapy Such knowledge will improve our understanding of which patients 
would benefit from indisulam treatment

Rewiring of energy metabolism drives resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Esther Zaal, Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Utrecht University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Harm-Jan de Grooth, Pieter Langerhorst, Haley Baptist, Wei Wu, Celia R. Berkers
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is successfully applied in the treatment of multiple myeloma, but its efficacy is restricted by the wide-spread 
occurrence of resistance Metabolic alterations play an important role in cancer development and aid in the cellular adaptation to pharmacologically 
changed environments Metabolic changes may therefore also play an essential role in the development of drug resistance Interestingly, cells could 
become reliant on such drug-induced metabolic reprogramming, a vulnerability that could be exploited for therapy Here, the metabolic pathways involved 
in resistance to bortezomib were elucidated using a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach To this end, bortezomib-sensitive and -resistant 
cell lines were profiled using a combination of steady-state metabolomics experiments and stable isotope labelling approaches These metabolomics 
studies were complemented with a metabolism-oriented targeted proteomics approach We demonstrate that BTZ-resistant cells extensively rewire their 
mitochondrial energy metabolism and identify metabolic drugs that could overcome bortezomib resistance By investigating gene expression patterns of 
metabolic genes in genome-wide data of MM patient samples, we show that rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism correlates to drug response and survival 
In conclusion, we provide novel mechanistic insights in the role of mitochondrial energy production in mediating bortezomib resistance Our data indicate 
that this metabolic rewiring correlates to drug response in MM patients and provide rationale for combining bortezomib with metabolic drugs to increase 
treatment efficacy

Understanding metabolite heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and the role of adaptive 
metabolic reprogramming in chemotherapy resistance
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sarah Hancock, University of New South Wales, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Jesse Estoque, Nigel Turner
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the most dismal prognoses in modern medicine with a 5-year survival of just 77% Contributing to the 
poor survivability of PDAC is its highly aggressive and chemoresistant nature, which is driven by extreme genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity Mutations 
in oncogenes result in wide-ranging effects on cell metabolism, allowing the cells to acquire metabolites necessary for rapid growth and proliferation 
Cellular heterogeneity can aid the cancer cells in acquiring chemoresistance through adaptive metabolic reprogramming, in which chemotherapy action 
is circumvented by engaging pro-survival metabolic pathways In this study, we use an untargeted metabolomics approach to determine the breadth of 
metabolite heterogeneity across four PDAC cells lines (MiaPaCa2, Panc1, BxPC3 and AsPC1) and one non-cancerous immortalised human pancreatic 
ductal epithelial (HPDE) cell line Approximately 800 features (ie unique combinations of retention time and mass-to-charge, m/z) were detected across 
these four pancreatic cell lines and a number of metabolic pathways were found to be altered compared with noncancerous pancreatic cells, including 
metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism, glycolysis, glutaminolysis, nucleotide synthesis, and lipid synthesis Metabolite profiling of gemcitabine-
treated PDAC cells has uncovered several potential adaptive metabolic pathways, many of which centre around non-essential amino acid metabolism 
Work is ongoing to elucidate mechanisms of chemoresistance in PDAC, including the use of stably labelled isotope tracing to further characterise 
mechanisms of chemoresistance in these cells

The volatile flavor composition network in tomato and its modification
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Antonio Granell, CSIC, Spain
Tomato is a model for fruit ripening and more recently also for the identification of the molecular genetic basis of what makes fruit healthy and palatable 
Organoleptic and nutritional quality in this climacteric fruit is regulated at different levels and metabolites associated with organoleptic and nutritional 
composition are part of the ripening process and increasingly the target/focus of geneticists and breeders The nutritional value of tomato fruit is not 
based on calories but on the healthy compounds they provide to our diet (main source of antioxidants and vitC in Western diets) Many of the plant/
tomato nutritional and healthy compounds are often precursors of compounds that contribute to flavour what supports the contention that good flavour 
and healthy compounds are part of the mechanism plants use to reward frugivors for dispersing the seed contained in their fruits Breeding or Biotech 
approaches aimed to higher nutritional content should go hand with hand with good flavour in order to really have an impact on consumers In my 
presentation I will illustrate examples were the use of genetic resources in combination with high throughput genotyping and phenotyping and biotech 
approaches is contributing to identifying genomic regions, markers and genes associated /underlying the variation in compounds of organoleptic or 
nutritional value I will also present how Plant Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology approaches are used in our lab to further expand the natural variation in 
metabolites either to increase the levels of nutritional or good flavor compounds or to eliminate anti nutritional compounds

Developing Advanced and Integrated Metabolomics Technologies to Address the Grand Challenges  
of Metabolite Identification and Depth of Coverage
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lloyd Sumner, University of Missouri, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Lloyd W. Sumner, Feng Qiu, Dennis Fine, Daniel Wherritt, Zhentian Lei, Anil Bhatia, Mark Schroeder, Aiko Barsch, Sven Meyer
The vast utility of metabolomics is well documented in the literature; however, its full scientific promise has not yet been realized due to multiple technical 
challenges These grand challenges include large-scale confident chemical identification of metabolites and greater depth of coverage We have 
developed sophisticated spectral, computational and integrated experimental metabolomics tools for the systematic and biologically directed annotation 
of plant metabolomes and for greater metabolome depth of coverage UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS metabolite profiling was first performed using Medicago 
truncatula methanol extracts, and the data processed by peak deconvolution and formula prediction Metabolite identifications were first attempted 
through spectral matching with custom MS and MS/MS libraries of 222 plant specialized metabolites Additional identifications were predicted using novel 
software entitled ‘Plant Metabolite Annotation Toolbox’ (PlantMAT) that generates in-silico prediction of metabolite structures based upon orthogonal 
empirical data PlantMAT includes both GC-MS and LC-MS modules The data was imported into PlantMAT and structures for approximately 100 saponins 
and polyphenolic glycosides were predicted Approximately 80 of these were isolated, purified and concentrated by UHPLC-MS-SPE The SPE isolated 
compounds were eluted and 1D and 2D NMR spectra acquired The results demonstrated that the cumulative platforms allow for higher-throughput and 
high confidence metabolite identifications UHPLC-timsTOF-MS/MS analyses were performed to discover potentially coeluting compounds and to increase 
our metabolomics depth of coverage for isobaric compounds not readily separated by UHPLC Examples are provided for hydroxylated flavonoids A library 
of CCS values are being measured and compiled for added confidence in metabolite identification

From MS peak to unambiguous metabolite identification using the WeizMass spectral library  
and LC-MS-SPE-NMR system
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Adam Jozwiak, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel
CO-AUTHORS: Nir Shahaf, Prashant D. Sonawane, Tali Scherf, Ilana Rogachev, Asaph Aharoni
Despite rapid advances in MS-based methods, unambiguous and high-confidence metabolite annotation is hitherto a significant concern in 
metabolomics experiments One of several complementary approaches that might assist in tackling this intricate issue is the usage of a comprehensive, 
reference compound-based spectral library We recently generated the WeizMass LC-MS based library composed of more than 6,000 spectra and 
representing diverse chemicals structures We also developed the MatchWeiz software that allows matching of experimental data to the WeizMass 
library Using such approach we significantly raised our confidence in metabolite identification, carrying out de-replication of known metabolites in 
diverse plant species and identifying in high confidence metabolites not reported previously from plants Direct coupling of LC-MS with Solid Phase 
Extraction (SPE) and NMR spectroscopy represents a complementary approach The main advantage of this set-up is its simplicity and low amount 
of material necessary for metabolite identification It is especially advantageous in case of amphipathic substances, eg saponins, requiring high 
quantities for NMR analysis In my presentation, I will demonstrate how hyphenated analytical techniques (ie LC-MS-SPE-NMR) facilitate saponin 
pathway discovery by providing structural data of complex metabolites and generating substrates for enzyme- and bio- activity assays Combination of 
high-resolution MS and several 2D-NMR techniques allowed unambiguous identification of novel acetylated medicagenic acid derived saponins from 
spinach Finally, we utilized the LC-MS-SPE-NMR system for an unequivocal annotation of biosynthetic intermediates produced by partial reconstruction 
of the biosynthetic pathway in heterologous system

Optimising and securing sustainable cacao production is hampered by a lack of knowledge of the chemical and genetic factors controlling the yield and 
quality of the beans used for preparing chocolate liquor We have used an integrated, multi-omics approach to genotype and chemically phenotype a 
dedicated F2 segregating population of a high yielding and a high quality Theobroma cacao parental cross Fermented beans and cocoa liquors obtained 
following standard industrial procedures were subjected to comprehensive metabolite profiling (LCMS pos/neg modes, GCTOFMS of (derivatised) polar 
compounds, and GCMS of volatile components) In parallel, sensory (taste) panel evaluations were performed on the chocolate liquors Dedicated statistics 
was applied to model sensory scores based on metabolite profiles and to select a small set of marker compounds predicting sensory quality scores based 
on either liquor or bean metabolites Subsequently, genetic mapping of the population was performed using co-dominant molecular markers and this map 
was used for large-scale Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis We identified 1760 traits (metabolites) in beans or liquors and these metabolites concerned 
many different chemical groups including amino acids, sugars, polyphenols and aromatic components 484 QTLs were also identified controlling 
either cocoa quality traits or individual metabolites indicating that 275% of the cocoa traits analysed is genetically controlled Further use of cacao fruit 
transcriptome data and gene mining of potential candidate genes co-localizing with QTLs controlling key cocoa quality parameters has given us for the first 
time deep insights into the genetic basis of cocoa (chocolate) quality

A tissue specific metabolomic study in hybrid aspen
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ilara Budzinski, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Ilka N Abreu, Thomas Moritz
Hybrid aspen is a commercially fast-growing tree, used in short rotation wood production in many countries As a renewable natural resource, providing 
timber, fibers and energy, wood is important for the environmental and economic perspective Wood formation is a complex process, subject to multiple 
levels of regulation (from cell division through programmed cell death) Despite its importance, the metabolic profile underlying wood formation still 
poorly understood To overcome this, we present a tissue specific metabolomics study in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x P tremuloides), using 
cryosectioning We used four-month-old trees cultivated under greenhouse conditions and supplied with different levels of fertilization solution (low, 
adequate and high) for controlling growth The stems were 20 µm thick tangential cryo-sectioned in: bark, inner bark, phloem, expanding phloem, 
cambium, expanding xylem, xylem and mature xylem Target and untargeted metabolomics (GC and LC-MS) was performed, including lipidomics 
analysis Trees treated with higher fertilization doses showed higher diameter and biomass, compared to the lower treatment By OPLS-DA we 
discriminate tissues and treatments Differentially abundant metabolites (VIP ≥10 and P ≤ 005) were identified from bark towards xylem As an example, 
proline, rhamnose, trehalose, sucrose exhibited a similar distribution pattern along the tissues, when comparing trees with contrasting stem diameter 
However, other metabolites were significant only in trees with smaller (fructose and glucose) or higher (arginine, methionine, salicin, stearyl acid) 
stem diameter The results obtained here represent the metabolic overview from bark towards wood-forming tissues, and highlighted the powerful 
combination of cryosectioning and metabolomics analysis

The Internet for Social Machines
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Barend Mons, GO FAIR, Netherlands
We are in a transition phase of science, where machines (mainly computers) have become our major research assistants Humans and computers 
increasingly work together as ‘social machines’ to makes sense of complex natural phenomena However, computers need a very different input as 
compared to people and the way we adapt the communication and reuse of our research results is adopting to this new situation only at glacial speed Still, 
the 15 FAIR Principles, publsihed in 2016, dealing with machine actionable data and services, have found unusually rapid uptake among a broad spectrum 
of stakeholders, from research scientists who create and reuse data, to publishers who distribute data, to science funders who track impact of data Barend 
will describe the FAIR Principles and show examples of how they have been implemented He will also present a set of core FAIR Metrics that can help 
gauge the level of FAIRness of any digital resource Of particular interest is how additional FAIR Metrics can (and should) be defined to address community-
specific data structures and analytic requirements This discussion, and these examples will be presented in the context of the International GO FAIR 
Initiative GO FAIR is a voluntary community of stakeholders devoted to implementation solutions of an emerging Internet of FAIR Data and Services

Matching Untargeted Liquid Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry Features Across Multiple Cohorts:  
Finding the Same Needles in Several Haystacks Via Networks

 In untargeted metabolomics, accurate within-dataset feature matching is aided by accessing large amounts of chromatographic/spectral information 
in each sample In contrast, when matching features from multiple cohorts/batches that used the same analytical method but were acquired and peak-
picked separately, only limited information is available - often only retention time and m/z (RT-MZ) medians We propose a new cross-cohort matching 
method which uses the RT-MZ median values of each feature (plus optionally feature intensity and other feature-quality measures) Initially matches within 
manually-defined RT-MZ thresholds between all one-to-one dataset combinations are detected In the next - key - step it builds a network of features 
(nodes) based on those matches (edges) Only matches in subnetworks (connected components) in which all nodes are connected to all other nodes 
(maximal cliques) are accepted, which removes features that matched by chance As some features may present multiple matching possibilities, a third 
step using RT-MZ differences to define a match-quality score is then used to decide the best single matches We illustrate the method’s performance 
by matching thousands of features from large studies of serum samples and inspecting the matching accuracy of hundreds of manually annotated 
metabolites, and by looking at several feature-quality metrics The method is not computationally intensive – eg matching 3 cohorts, each with 1000s of 
features, takes less than a minute on a typical desktop machine  The new approach addresses a key problem in metabolomics studies and promises to 
make analysis of large untargeted multi-cohort data sets a viable option

Visualizing metabolomics data in directed biological networks
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Denise Slenter, Maastricht University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Martina Kutmon, Jonathan Mélius, Ryan Miller, Georg Summer, Chris T. Evelo, Egon L. Willighagen
Metabolomics data describes the state of a biological system at a phenotypic level Unfortunately, not all measured metabolites can be linked 
to metabolite identities present in biological pathway models The resulting sparseness makes it more complicated to use metabolomics data in 
pathway and network analysis By creating networks from existing pathways, the metabolic data sparseness can be overcome, by calculating the 
shortest path between metabolites To upscale this approach, we need to be able to combine different pathway knowledge bases and introduce 
detailed directionality information, ensuring the shortest paths follow one-directional biological cause-and-effect paths The presented work creates 
subnetworks of shortest, directed pathways between active metabolites First, with the WikiPathways RDF, we created a directed network of all 
metabolic reactions from the WikiPathways and Reactome pathway knowledgebase In the next step, we identified the location(s) of the active 
metabolites in the network, in which we match data with nodes in the network using knowledge from Wikidata Finally, using the cyNeo4j app for 
Cytoscape we extracted the smallest connected subnetwork between the changed metabolites using the functionality of the graph database 
Neo4j We developed a new solution to visualize the biological pathways involved in sparse metabolomics data Using knowledge from two pathway 
resources, we can show the directed networks between active metabolites from metabolomics data By using Neo4j and Cytoscape, we ensure the 
computational calculation environment for larger networks as well as advanced visualization functionality to investigate the identified subnetworks This 
approach can be extended with proteomics and transcriptomics data

High-throughput metabolomics identifies substrate-enzyme relationships in a metabolism-wide CRISPR 
interference library
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hannes Link, Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Stefano Donati, Vanessa Pahl, Timo Glatter
Construction of large genetic variant libraries has become very fast and versatile The current challenge is measuring molecular phenotypes of large 
strain libraries with high-throughput Here, we show that high-throughput metabolomics identifies metabolic phenotypes in a CRISPR interference library 
in Escherichia coli We have recently created a metabolism-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library that targets all genes in the metabolic network of 
E coli and characterized growth of the strains with next generation sequencing (1) Now we measured the metabolome of 118 CRISPRi strains, which have 
targets in central metabolism, and in biosynthesis pathways of cofactors, nucleotides and amino acids By using a quantitative and fast (2 min) isotope ratio 
LC–MS/MS method (2), we quantified about 150 primary metabolites in the CRISPRi strains In many strains we observed specific increases of substrates 
of the targeted enzymes Especially downregulation of enzymes in biosynthetic pathways resulted in an accumulation of intermediates, which are under 
normal conditions undetectable in E coli These substrate-enzyme relationships suggest that biosynthetic enzymes in wild-type cells operate far away from 
their maximal capacity, and therefore biosynthetic intermediates are often very low abundant Finally, by integrating the metabolome data with proteome 
data we show how metabolite concentration changes affect enzyme-level regulation and the global proteome of CRISPRi strains

Weighting strategies for the analysis of secondary outcomes in nested case-control metabolomics data
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Gerard Gonzales, Ghent University, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Vladimer Kobayashi
Freely available metabolomics datasets in public repositories allow us to investigate other biological questions without necessarily recruiting new 
cohorts of human volunteers However, considering that the data was selected for a different purpose, it may potentially introduce bias when analysing 
secondary outcomes of interest We propose to remedy this problem by introducing weights to observations In this study, we tested various weighting 
strategies namely, inverse probability weighting and the ones derived from boosting and neural network We then illustrate their uses to investigate the 
urinary metabolomic signature specifically associated with smoking by using available data from a case-control urinary metabolomics study where the 
participants were originally selected for presence or absence of lung cancer (MTBLS28) We show that directly using the dataset without weighting resulted
