**Title: Rewiring of Energy Metabolism Drives Resistance to the Proteasome Inhibitor Bortezomib**

**Presenting Author:**
- Esther Zaal, Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Utrecht University, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:**
- Harm-Jan de Grooth, Pieter Langerhorst, Haley Baptist, Wei Wu, Celia R. Berkers

**Abstract:**
Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, is effective in treating multiple myeloma (MM) but faces challenges due to widespread resistance. Metabolic alterations play a crucial role in cancer development and can help cells adapt to pharmacologically altered environments. These changes may also contribute to drug resistance. Cells can become dependent on such drug-induced metabolic reprogramming, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.

In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in bortezomib resistance. We profiled both bortezomib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines using steady-state metabolomics and stable isotope labeling. These metabolomics studies were complemented with targeted proteomics.

Our results show that bortezomib-resistant cells extensively rewire their mitochondrial energy metabolism. We identified metabolic drugs that could potentially overcome bortezomib resistance. By analyzing gene expression patterns of metabolic genes in MM patient samples, we found that mitochondrial metabolism rewiring correlates with drug response and survival.

In conclusion, our findings provide novel insights into the role of mitochondrial energy production in mediating bortezomib resistance. This metabolic rewiring correlates with drug response in MM patients, suggesting that combining bortezomib with metabolic drugs could enhance treatment efficacy.

**Title: Understanding Metabolite Heterogeneity in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and the Role of Adaptive Metabolic Reprogramming in Chemotherapy Resistance**

**Presenting Author:**
- Sarah Hancock, University of New South Wales, Australia

**Co-Authors:**
- Jesse Estoque, Nigel Turner

**Abstract:**
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the poorest prognoses in modern medicine, with a 5-year survival rate of only 7.7%. The aggressive and chemoresistant nature of PDAC is driven by extreme genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Mutations in oncogenes lead to significant changes in cell metabolism, allowing rapid growth and proliferation. Cellular heterogeneity can also contribute to chemoresistance through adaptive metabolic reprogramming, where pro-survival metabolic pathways are engaged to circumvent chemotherapy action.

We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to determine the extent of metabolite heterogeneity across four PDAC cell lines (MiaPaCa2, Panc1, BxPC3, and AsPC1) and one non-cancerous immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cell line. Approximately 800 unique features (combinations of retention time and mass-to-charge, m/z) were detected, and several metabolic pathways were found to be altered compared to non-cancerous pancreatic cells, including central carbon metabolism, glycolysis, glutaminolysis, nucleotide synthesis, and lipid synthesis.

Metabolite profiling of gemcitabine-treated PDAC cells revealed several potential adaptive metabolic pathways, many of which involve non-essential amino acid metabolism. Ongoing work aims to further characterize these mechanisms of chemoresistance using stably labeled isotope tracing.

**Title: The Volatile Flavor Composition Network in Tomato and Its Modification**

**Presenting Author:**
- Antonio Granell, CSIC, Spain

**Abstract:**
Tomato serves as a model for fruit ripening and, more recently, for understanding the molecular genetic basis of fruit health and palatability. Organoleptic and nutritional quality in this climacteric fruit is regulated at various levels, with metabolites associated with organoleptic and nutritional composition being integral to the ripening process. The nutritional value of tomatoes is not based on calories but on the healthy compounds they provide, such as antioxidants and vitamin C.

Many plant/tomato nutritional and healthy compounds are precursors of flavor-contributing compounds, supporting the idea that good flavor and healthy compounds are part of the mechanism plants use to reward frugivores for seed dispersal. Breeding or biotech approaches aimed at increasing nutritional content should also focus on maintaining good flavor to have a real impact on consumers.

In this presentation, I will discuss how the use of genetic resources, high-throughput genotyping, and phenotyping, combined with biotech approaches, is helping to identify genomic regions, markers, and genes associated with the variation in compounds of organoleptic or nutritional value. I will also present how plant biotechnology and synthetic biology approaches are being used to expand the natural variation in metabolites, either to increase the levels of nutritional or good flavor compounds or to eliminate anti-nutritional compounds.

**Title: Developing Advanced and Integrated Metabolomics Technologies to Address the Grand Challenges of Metabolite Identification and Depth of Coverage**

**Presenting Author:**
- Lloyd Sumner, University of Missouri, United States

**Co-Authors:**
- Lloyd W. Sumner, Feng Qiu, Dennis Fine, Daniel Wherritt, Zhentian Lei, Anil Bhatia, Mark Schroeder, Aiko Barsch, Sven Meyer

**Abstract:**
The utility of metabolomics is well-documented, but its full scientific potential remains unrealized due to technical challenges, such as large-scale confident chemical identification of metabolites and greater depth of coverage. We have developed sophisticated spectral, computational, and integrated experimental metabolomics tools for the systematic and biologically directed annotation of plant metabolomes and for greater metabolome depth of coverage.

We performed UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS metabolite profiling on Medicago truncatula methanol extracts, processed the data by peak deconvolution and formula prediction, and attempted metabolite identifications through spectral matching with custom MS and MS/MS libraries. Additional identifications were predicted using the Plant Metabolite Annotation Toolbox (PlantMAT), which generates in-silico predictions of metabolite structures based on orthogonal empirical data. We predicted structures for approximately 100 saponins and polyphenolic glycosides, isolated and purified about 80 of these, and acquired 1D and 2D NMR spectra.

UHPLC-timsTOF-MS/MS analyses were conducted to discover co-eluting compounds and to increase metabolomics depth of coverage for isobaric compounds. Examples include hydroxylated flavonoids. A library of CCS values is being compiled to enhance confidence in metabolite identification.

**Title: From MS Peak to Unambiguous Metabolite Identification Using the WeizMass Spectral Library and LC-MS-SPE-NMR System**

**Presenting Author:**
- Adam Jozwiak, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel

**Co-Authors:**
- Nir Shahaf, Prashant D. Sonawane, Tali Scherf, Ilana Rogachev, Asaph Aharoni

**Abstract:**
Despite advances in MS-based methods, unambiguous and high-confidence metabolite annotation remains a significant challenge in metabolomics. One approach to address this is the use of a comprehensive, reference compound-based spectral library. We recently generated the WeizMass LC-MS-based library, which contains over 6,000 spectra representing diverse chemical structures. We also developed the MatchWeiz software to match experimental data to the WeizMass library, significantly increasing our confidence in metabolite identification.

Direct coupling of LC-MS with Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) and NMR spectroscopy provides a complementary approach, particularly advantageous for amphipathic substances like saponins, which require high quantities for NMR analysis. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how hyphenated analytical techniques (LC-MS-SPE-NMR) facilitate saponin pathway discovery by providing structural data of complex metabolites and generating substrates for enzyme and bioactivity assays. High-resolution MS and 2D-NMR techniques allowed unambiguous identification of novel acetylated medicagenic acid-derived saponins from spinach. We also used the LC-MS-SPE-NMR system to unequivocally annotate biosynthetic intermediates produced by partial reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathway in a heterologous system.

**Title: Chocolate Metabolomics**

**Abstract:**
Optimizing and securing sustainable cacao production is hindered by a lack of knowledge about the chemical and genetic factors controlling bean yield and quality. We used an integrated, multi-omics approach to genotype and chemically phenotype a dedicated F2 segregating population of a high-yielding and high-quality Theobroma cacao parental cross. Fermented beans and cocoa liquors obtained following standard industrial procedures were subjected to comprehensive metabolite profiling using LC-MS (positive and negative modes), GC-TOF-MS of polar compounds, and GC-MS of volatile components. Sensory panel evaluations were performed on the chocolate liquors.

Dedicated statistics were applied to model sensory scores based on metabolite profiles and to select a small set of marker compounds predicting sensory quality scores. Genetic mapping of the population was performed using co-dominant molecular markers, and this map was used for large-scale Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis. We identified 1,760 traits (metabolites) in beans or liquors, covering various chemical groups, and 484 QTLs controlling either cocoa quality traits or individual metabolites, indicating that 27.5% of the analyzed cocoa traits are genetically controlled.

Further use of cacao fruit transcriptome data and gene mining of potential candidate genes co-localizing with QTLs controlling key cocoa quality parameters has provided deep insights into the genetic basis of cocoa (chocolate) quality.

**Title: A Tissue-Specific Metabolomic Study in Hybrid Aspen**

**Presenting Author:**
- Ilara Budzinski, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Sweden

**Co-Authors:**
- Ilka N Abreu, Thomas Moritz

**Abstract:**
Hybrid aspen is a fast-growing tree used in short-rotation wood production in many countries. As a renewable natural resource, it is important for both environmental and economic reasons. Wood formation is a complex process subject to multiple levels of regulation, but the metabolic profile underlying this process is still poorly understood.

To address this, we conducted a tissue-specific metabolomics study in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides) using cryosectioning. Four-month-old trees were cultivated under greenhouse conditions with different levels of fertilization (low, adequate, and high). Stems were cryo-sectioned into bark, inner bark, phloem, expanding phloem, cambium, expanding xylem, xylem, and mature xylem. Target and untargeted metabolomics (GC and LC-MS) and lipidomics analysis were performed.

Trees treated with higher fertilization doses showed increased diameter and biomass compared to those with lower treatment. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) discriminated tissues and treatments. Differentially abundant metabolites (VIP ≥1.0 and P ≤ 0.05) were identified from bark to xylem. For example, proline, rhamnose, trehalose, and sucrose exhibited similar distribution patterns along the tissues when comparing trees with contrasting stem diameters. However, other metabolites, such as fructose and glucose, were significant only in trees with smaller stem diameters, while arginine, methionine, salicin, and stearyl acid were significant in trees with larger stem diameters.

These results provide a metabolic overview from bark to wood-forming tissues and highlight the powerful combination of cryosectioning and metabolomics analysis.

**Title: The Internet for Social Machines**

**Presenting Author:**
- Barend Mons, GO FAIR, Netherlands

**Abstract:**
We are in a transition phase of science where machines, mainly computers, have become our major research assistants. Humans and computers increasingly work together as "social machines" to make sense of complex natural phenomena. However, the input required by computers is very different from that needed by people, and the adaptation of communication and reuse of research results is slow.

The 15 FAIR Principles, published in 2016, deal with machine-actionable data and services and have been rapidly adopted by a broad spectrum of stakeholders, from researchers to publishers and funders. In this presentation, I will describe the FAIR Principles and provide examples of their implementation. I will also present core FAIR Metrics to gauge the level of FAIRness of any digital resource and discuss how additional FAIR Metrics can be defined to address community-specific data structures and analytic requirements. This discussion will be presented in the context of the International GO FAIR Initiative, a voluntary community of stakeholders devoted to implementing solutions for an emerging Internet of FAIR Data and Services.

**Title: Matching Untargeted Liquid Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry Features Across Multiple Cohorts: Finding the Same Needles in Several Haystacks Via Networks**

**Presenting Author:**
- Rui Climaco Pinto, Imperial College London, United Kingdom

**Co-Authors:**
- Ibrahim Karaman, Matt R. Lewis, Jenny Hällqvist, Manuja Kaluarachchi, Gonçalo Graça, Elena Chekmeneva, Mohammad Arfan Ikram, Abbas Dehghan, Paul Elliott, Ioanna Tzoulaki, David Herrington, Timothy Ebbels

**Abstract:**
In untargeted metabolomics, accurate within-dataset feature matching is aided by accessing large amounts of chromatographic/spectral information in each sample. However, when matching features from multiple cohorts/batches that used the same analytical method but were acquired and peak-picked separately, only limited information is available, often just retention time and m/z (RT-MZ) medians.

We propose a new cross-cohort matching method that uses RT-MZ median values of each feature, plus optionally feature intensity and other feature-quality measures. Initially, matches within manually-defined RT-MZ thresholds between all one-to-one dataset combinations are detected. In the next key step, a network of features (nodes) is built based on those matches (edges). Only matches in subnetworks (connected components) where all nodes are connected to all other nodes (maximal cliques) are accepted, removing features that matched by chance. A third step uses RT-MZ differences to define a match-quality score to decide the best single matches.

We illustrate the method's performance by matching thousands of features from large studies of serum samples, inspecting the matching accuracy of hundreds of manually annotated metabolites, and evaluating several feature-quality metrics. The method is not computationally intensive; matching three cohorts, each with thousands of features, takes less than a minute on a typical desktop machine. This new approach addresses a key problem in metabolomics studies and promises to make the analysis of large untargeted multi-cohort datasets a viable option.

**Title: Visualizing Metabolomics Data in Directed Biological Networks**

**Presenting Author:**
- Denise Slenter, Maastricht University, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:**
- Martina Kutmon, Jonathan Mélius, Ryan Miller, Georg Summer, Chris T. Evelo, Egon L. Willighagen

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics data describes the state of a biological system at a phenotypic level. However, not all measured metabolites can be linked to metabolite identities in biological pathway models, leading to sparseness. To overcome this, we create networks from existing pathways, calculating the shortest path between metabolites. To upscale this approach, we need to combine different pathway knowledge bases and introduce detailed directionality information, ensuring the shortest paths follow one-directional biological cause-and-effect paths.

We created subnetworks of the shortest, directed pathways between active metabolites. First, we used the WikiPathways RDF to create a directed network of all metabolic reactions from the WikiPathways and Reactome pathway knowledgebase. Next, we identified the locations of active metabolites in the network, matching data with nodes using knowledge from Wikidata. Finally, using the cyNeo4j app for Cytoscape, we extracted the smallest connected subnetwork between changed metabolites using the functionality of the graph database Neo4j.

This approach visualizes the biological pathways involved in sparse metabolomics data. By using two pathway resources, we can show the directed networks between active metabolites. Using Neo4j and Cytoscape ensures a computational environment for larger networks and advanced visualization functionality to investigate the identified subnetworks. This approach can be extended with proteomics and transcriptomics data.

**Title: High-Throughput Metabolomics Identifies Substrate-Enzyme Relationships in a Metabolism-Wide CRISPR Interference Library**

**Presenting Author:**
- Hannes Link, Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Germany

**Co-Authors:**
- Stefano Donati, Vanessa Pahl, Timo Glatter

**Abstract:**
Constructing large genetic variant libraries has become fast and versatile, but the current challenge is measuring molecular phenotypes of large strain libraries with high throughput. Here, we show that high-throughput metabolomics identifies metabolic phenotypes in a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library in Escherichia coli. We recently created a metabolism-wide CRISPRi library targeting all genes in the metabolic network of E. coli and characterized growth using next-generation sequencing.

We measured the metabolome of 118 CRISPRi strains, which target central metabolism and biosynthesis pathways of cofactors, nucleotides, and amino acids. Using a quantitative and fast (2 min) isotope ratio LC-MS/MS method, we quantified about 150 primary metabolites. In many strains, we observed specific increases in substrates of the targeted enzymes. Downregulation of enzymes in biosynthetic pathways resulted in the accumulation of intermediates, which are normally undetectable in E. coli. These substrate-enzyme relationships suggest that biosynthetic enzymes in wild-type cells operate far from their maximal capacity, making biosynthetic intermediates low-abundant.

By integrating the metabolome data with proteome data, we show how metabolite concentration changes affect enzyme-level regulation and the global proteome of CRISPRi strains.

**Title: Weighting Strategies for the Analysis of Secondary Outcomes in Nested Case-Control Metabolomics Data**

**Presenting Author:**
- Gerard Gonzales, Ghent University, Belgium

**Co-Authors:**
- Vladimer Kobayashi

**Abstract:**
Freely available metabolomics datasets in public repositories allow us to investigate other biological questions without recruiting new cohorts of human volunteers. However, using data selected for a different purpose can introduce bias when analyzing secondary outcomes. We propose to address this issue by introducing weights to observations.

In this study, we tested various weighting strategies, including inverse probability weighting and those derived from boosting and neural networks. We then illustrated their use to investigate the urinary metabolomic signature specifically associated with smoking, using data from a case-control urinary metabolomics study where participants were originally selected for the presence or absence of lung cancer (MTBLS28).

We show that directly using the dataset without weighting resulted in biased results. By applying appropriate weighting, we were able to reduce bias and improve the accuracy of the secondary outcome analysis.
