User: If I open a a file as os.open( '/dev/ttyS2', O_RDWR | O_NDELAY ), is there any way that I can check when my 'write()' commands have finished? Or, can I open a file for non-blocking read but blocking write?
Assistant: OS API write() returns count of written bytes. Checking this value against size of your input you can see when all input is sent.
