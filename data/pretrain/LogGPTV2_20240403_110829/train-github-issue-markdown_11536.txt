### Environment
- **Electron Version:** 1.8.1
- **Operating System:** macOS 10.12.5

### Expected Behavior
When I click the `menuItem` with the role `"about"` in the tray's context menu, it should trigger a click event that activates and brings the application to the foreground, displaying the "About" panel.

### Actual Behavior
There is no way to attach a click event handler to the `menuItem` with the role `"about"` that will bring the application to the foreground. As a result, if the Electron app is covered by another application, the "About" panel does not become visible when the `menuItem` is clicked.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a `menuItem` with the role `"about"` in the tray's context menu.
2. Run another application and position its window so that it covers the Electron app.
3. Click the "About" `menuItem` in the tray's context menu.
4. The "About" panel will not be displayed because the Electron app remains in the background, covered by the other application.
