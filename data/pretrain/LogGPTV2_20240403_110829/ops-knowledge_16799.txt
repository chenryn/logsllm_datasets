Question: A security team implements a path traversal attack prevention mechanism that strips out all occurrences of '..\' from the user input before using it to access the file system. An audit is conducted to assess the robustness of this mechanism. Which of the following points should be raised as a potential weakness during the audit?
"A": "The mechanism does not account for alternative encodings of the '..\' sequences that could be used to bypass the filter.",
"B": "The mechanism does not convert lowercase letters to uppercase, which might result in inconsistent path resolutions.",
"C": "The mechanism fails to strip out all numeric characters, potentially allowing access to files named with digits.",
"D": "The mechanism correctly neutralizes all '..\' sequences, making it impossible to traverse directories."
Answer: A
