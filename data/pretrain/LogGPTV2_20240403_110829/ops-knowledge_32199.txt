issued for a connection request from an old client, /10.10.34.12:54126, which will be dropped if the server is in read-only mode. Another new session attempt is made at /10.10.34.11:57796, and a session is established with a negotiated timeout of 10000 for client /10.10.34.21:42521. A third session is expired due to a 10000ms timeout, and a socket connection is closed for a client with sessionid 0x24edfaa8717001a. Finally, a session termination is processed for sessionid 0x14edfaa86f60019.

In summary, this log chunk captures various activities related to session management and connection handling in a ZooKeeper server environment. Key events include:

- **Session Establishment and Negotiation**: Multiple sessions are established for different clients, each with a negotiated timeout.
- **Connection Handling**: Socket connections are opened and closed, and some are flagged for potential issues (e.g., end of stream exception).
- **Session Expiration**: Several sessions are expired due to exceeding the timeout period.
- **Quorum and Snapshot Management**: The quorum peer is started, and a snapshot is taken, indicating regular maintenance and data consistency operations.
- **Client Connection Warnings**: A warning is issued for a connection request from an old client, which may be dropped if the server is in read-only mode.

These logs provide insights into the operational status and health of the ZooKeeper server, highlighting both normal operations and potential issues that need attention.
