other online advertising, the former being ∼20% of the total online
advertising [36]. Considering these factors, the overall average user
ad-cost (25th-75th perc.) would be in the range of $0.54-6.85, which
is in the order of magnitude reported by major online advertising
platforms such as Twi(cid:138)er (owner of MoPub, ARPU: $7-8 [30]) and
Facebook (ARPU: $14-17 [13]) during the period 2015-2016.
7 RELATED WORK
(cid:140)ere is a plethora of papers studying privacy loss and tracking
techniques in the wild [1, 17, 21, 48, 52, 60, 71]. (cid:140)ere are also
others proposing privacy preserving countermeasures based on
either (i) randomization-/obfuscation- based techniques [59, 65],
where the authors aim to pollute the information trackers retrieve
in order to hide the users’ data and interests, or (ii) anti-tracking
mechanisms [47, 64], where requests to trackers are avoided or
blocked. All the above studies, highlight the voracity of web entities
to collect data about the user and her online behavior, and an arms
race between the privacy-aware users and trackers.
But how do all these trackers monetize from these data? (cid:140)e
answer is in the advertising ecosystem, where advertisers are pur-
chasing audiences to deliver their ad-impressions. (cid:140)erefore, there
are studies focusing solely on privacy preservation in the adver-
tising ecosystem. For example, Privad [32] is designed to conceal
user activities from an ad-network, by interposing an anonymizing
proxy between the browser and the ad-network, allowing a trusted
client so(cid:137)ware to select relevant ads locally. Unfortunately, it re-
quires broad adoption of high-performance anonymizing proxies.
Alternatively, Adnostic [78] is an architecture for interest-targeted
advertising without tracking. Like Privad, Adnostic uses client-
based functionality to perform ad selection, but eliminates anonymiz-
ing proxies at the cost of less precise ad targeting. In [66], authors
propose obfuscation of the user’s full identity while browsing the
web. (cid:140)is was achieved by introducing Web Identity Translator
(WIT) in-between the user’s client and the visited websites. Given
that advertisers are interested in adjusting their buying strategy
at real time, it is unclear if such approaches can be adapted to
contemporary technologies such as RTB auctions.
(cid:140)e economics of private data have long been an interesting
topic and a(cid:138)racted a considerable body of research either from the
user’s perspective [2, 11, 70, 74], or the advertiser’s perspective [14,
19, 22, 62]. In [2] authors discuss the value of privacy a(cid:137)er de(cid:128)ning
two concepts (i) Willingness To Pay: the monetary amount users
Figure 19: Average cleartext vs. average estimated encrypted price
per impression of each user in D.
are willing to pay to protect their privacy, and (ii) Willingness
To Accept: the compensation that users are willing to accept for
their privacy loss. In two user-studies [11, 74] authors measure
how much users value their own o(cid:132)ine and online personal data,
and consequently how much they would sell them to advertisers.
In [70], the authors propose “transactional” privacy to allow users
to decide what personal information can be released and receive
compensation from selling them.
In [62], the authors perform an analysis of cookie matching in
association with the RTB advertising. Similar to our approach, they
leverage the RTB nURL to observe the charge prices and they con-
duct a basic study to provide some insights into these prices, by
analyzing di(cid:130)erent user pro(cid:128)les and visiting contexts. (cid:140)eir results
con(cid:128)rm that when the users’ browsing histories are leaked, the
charge prices tend to be increased. Similarly, in [61], the authors
propose a transparency enhancing tool showing to the users the
RTB charge price every time a RTB auction is performed. Further-
more, they collect pro(cid:128)led and un-pro(cid:128)led data from a browser
extension and a crawler respectively, and they compare the RTB
prices, the bidding frequency and the inter-relations among ADXs
and DSPs. Contrary to our work, both studies use a dataset from (i)
a small number of 100 users, (ii) over desktop, (iii) covering only one
month, (iv) and based on these data, they estimate the advertising
total revenues using only the cleartext prices based on the arbitrary
assumption that encrypted and cleartext prices follow the same
distributions. Although their results regarding the average prices
per ad are comparable to ours (∼0.5CPM Vs. ∼0.26CPM), they are
not equal since their study was conducted on desktop and in 2013,
when ad spending in desktop was higher than in mobile [12].
In [22], authors use a dataset of users’ HTTP traces and provide
rough estimates of the relative value of users by leveraging the
suggested bid amounts for the visited websites, based on categories
provided by the Google AdWords. FDTV [14] is a plugin to inform
users in real-time about the economic value of the personal infor-
mation associated to their Facebook activity. Although similar to
ours, our approach works for all HTTP activity of mobile users.
Furthermore, journalists from Financial Times, created an inter-
active calculator [19] to explore how valuable speci(cid:128)c pieces of
user data are for the ad-companies. (cid:140)is calculator is based on the
analysis of industry pricing data from a range of sources in the US.
Finally, the rapid growth of RTB auctions has drawn the a(cid:138)ention
of the research community, which aims to explore the economics
of the RTB ad ecosystem. In [83], the authors provide an insight to

use internal data of an ADX and they study its bidding behaviors
and strategies. In [81], the authors propose a winning price pre-
dicting mechanism by leveraging machine learning and statistical
methods to train a model using the bidding history. (cid:140)eir predict-
ing approach aims to help DSPs (cid:128)ne-tune their bids accordingly.
(cid:140)ough such studies help us understand some internal mechanisms
of ADXs and DSPs, they are not applicable to our se(cid:138)ing as we try
to infer the cumulative ad-cost of each user based on user-related
features that are measurable from the user’s device over time.
8 DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION
Limitations. Our approach, through YourAdValue plugin, moni-
tors the charge prices for each auctioned ad-slot. However, there
are several cost models in digital ad-buying. For example, Cost-
Per-Impression is where the advertiser pays when an impression is
rendered, and Cost-Per-Click is where the advertiser pays only if
the impression is rendered and clicked, etc. Given that our study is
based on passive measurements, we currently unable to determine
the cost model of each auctioned ad-slot. (cid:140)erefore, we assume
all charge prices are under the Cost-Per-Impression model, thus
computing the maximum cost advertisers pay for a user.
Computing (cid:135)e (cid:128)nancial worth of individuals. Via our
methodology, users can estimate, at real time, the cost advertis-
ers pay to reach them. However, this work’s important technical
contribution, i.e., how to compute the (cid:128)nancial worth of individu-
als with a passive measurement method has several applications.
Our methodology could provide more transparency on what each
type of the users’ personal data is worth, and allow users to take
advantage of, and (re)negotiate their online value with data hub
companies who are interested in investing and innovating in the
area of targeted advertising. Also, such companies can use our
methodology to assess the costs implied in this area, how to allo-
cated appropriate resources and, even, estimating bidding strategies
of competitors. In addition, regulators and policy makers could pro-
vide guidelines and laws to users and companies for containing the
leakage of users’ personal data. Finally, tax auditors could estimate
ad-companies’ revenues, and detect discrepancies from their tax
declarations in an independent and transparent way.
Conclusion. In this study, we aim to enhance transparency in the
ad ecosystem, where user’s personal data is the most important fac-
tor a(cid:130)ecting the pricing dynamics. We developed a (cid:128)rst of its kind
methodology to estimate how much do advertisers pay to reach a
user. Our methodology leverages the rapidly growing RTB proto-
col and the new advertising model of programmatic instantaneous
auctions, where the advertisers evaluate the users’ collected data at
real time and bid for an ad-slot in their display. Our study analyzes
the RTB price noti(cid:128)cations sent to winning advertising bidders and
focuses on the distinction between cleartext and encrypted price
noti(cid:128)cations and how to estimate the la(cid:138)er. Towards this end, we
train a model using as ground truth prices obtained by running our
own probing ad-campaigns. We bootstrap and validate our method-
ology using a year long trace of real user browsing data, as well as
two real world ad-campaigns. Finally, we designed YourAdValue: a
system to allow users to compute at real time the value advertisers
pay to reach them. As future work, we plan to make our prototype
(a preliminary version can be seen in Figure 20) available for the
community to test and explore its e(cid:130)ectiveness with online users.
