User: I've a number of python scripts that I am likely to need to distribute to users who may have minimal x86 linux setups and no guarantees of having python or a particular version of it.
My desktop is an x86-84 architecture setup, but I am able to cross compile 32 bit elf's with GCC.
The python freeze script is currently outputting a 64 bit elf, plus a 64 bit .so. Is there any option/hack etc known to get this to compile to a 32 bit output?
Assistant: Could you use something likemake CFLAGS="-m32".?
