ABSTRACT
Despite efforts to replace them, passwords remain the primary
form of authentication on the web. Password managers seek to
address many of the problems with passwords by helping users
generate, store, and fill strong and unique passwords. Even though
experts frequently recommend password managers, there is lim-
ited information regarding their usability. To aid in designing such
usability studies, we systematize password manager use cases, iden-
tifying ten essential use cases, three recommended use cases, and
four extended use cases. We also systematize the system designs
employed to satisfy these use cases, designs that should be exam-
ined in usability studies to understand their relative strengths and
weaknesses. Finally, we describe observations from 136 cognitive
walkthroughs exploring the identified essential use cases in eight
popular managers. Ultimately, we expect that this work will serve
as the foundation for an explosion of new research into the usability
of password managers.

1 INTRODUCTION
Despite efforts to replace password, they remain the primary form
of authentication on the Web [2]. Still, passwords have many limita-
tions: for example, users create easily guessed passwords [5, 23] and
reuse the same password across accounts [4, 10, 20, 33]. Password
managers seek to address these problems by helping users generate
strong passwords (avoiding weak passwords), storing those pass-
words (encouraging unique passwords at every website), and filling
those passwords (ensuring passwords are only sent to the correct
website).
There have been several studies examining the usability of pass-
word managers [3, 8, 13, 16, 17, 21, 22, 29, 31]. However, as we
will show in this work, they do not cover the full range of use
cases supported by modern managers. Furthermore, most of these
studies focus on high-level evaluations of password management,
with few [3, 31] specifically identifying and studying the high-level
designs (hereafter referred to as design paradigms) used to create
password managers. This gap in the research literature means that
design paradigms’ relative strengths and weaknesses are unclear,
preventing an informed approach to creating password managers.
To help guide the design of usability studies that address these
gaps in the research, we systematize the use cases and design
paradigms for password management. This systematization is guided
by a review of password management documentation, examining
12 desktop and 12 mobile password managers, and reviewing the
literature. Our systematization identifies seventeen use cases, cate-
gorized into essential use cases supported by all password managers,
recommended use cases supported by a plurality of managers, and
extended use cases supported by a minority of users or represent
non-critical use cases. We also identified 77 design paradigms that
can facilitate these use cases, 65 of which are built into deployed
managers, three proposed in the research literature, and nine rec-
ommended based on our experiences evaluating managers.
While it is certainly possible that a different set of authors would
end up with a somewhat different taxonomy, this is true of nearly
all systematizations published at top security conferences. Regard-
less, this systematization is sufficient to help guide future usability
studies exploring the usability of use cases that have not been
previously studied. Similarly, we expect that our enumeration of
design paradigms will make it easier for researchers to identify de-
sign paradigms to study and compare against each other in future
studies.

As a first step in this direction, we used our systematization to
perform cognitive walkthroughs of eight popular desktop managers,
evaluating seventeen tasks covering the essential and recommended
uses cases identified in our systematization. While not a replace-
ment for user studies, these cognitive walkthroughs help identify
low-hanging usability issues in the studied managers [14, 34]. Obser-
vations from these walkthroughs include significant issues entering
credentials when autofill is unavailable, confusing interface designs,
and challenges linking credentials to multiple websites.
In short, our contributions are,
(1) Identification of password management use cases (§2).
We identify seventeen different sets of tasks (i.e., use cases)
that password managers support. We further categorize these
use cases based on their importance to the password manage-
ment experience. These use cases and their categorizations
identify which functionality needs to be examined in user
studies of password managers and can help inform the de-
sign of scenarios to use in those studies. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the majority of these use cases have not
been previously studied.
(2) Enumeration of design paradigms found in password
managers and the research literature (§3). For each use
case, we identify the system designs (i.e., design paradigms)
used to support that use case. These design paradigms in-
clude those used in existing password managers, those pro-
posed in the research literature, and several novel paradigms
we propose in this work. This list of design paradigms can
inform the creation of future user studies that compare these
paradigms, revealing information about their relative advan-
tages and disadvantages.
(3) Initial exploration of usability challenges in password
managers using cognitive walkthroughs (§4). In this pa-
per, we demonstrate that most use cases, and by extension
design paradigms, have not previously been studied. As a
first step, we performed cognitive walkthroughs of eight
desktop password managers, completing tasks related to
the majority of the use cases. Observations from these walk-
throughs help identify low-hanging usability issues that need
to be addressed.
2 USE CASES
Understanding how managers are intended to be used—i.e., their
use cases—is critical in identifying what tasks should be studied in
usability studies. While at a high level, the password manager life
cycle can be described as supporting password generation, storage,
and autofill [19], this list of activities is overly vague and does not
fully cover the myriad ways in which modern password managers
are used. In this section, we address this gap by providing a complete
taxonomy of password manager use cases.
To identify use cases, we considered three sources. First, we
read the documentation for password managers, identifying what
companies consider to be use cases for their products. Second, we
examined the most popular and downloaded publicly available
desktop and mobile password managers (see Tables 1 and 2, respec-
tively), identifying uses cases not described in the documentation.

Third, we reviewed the research literature (though this did not
reveal any use cases not discovered in the previous two sources).
In total, we identify seventeen use cases. We group these use
cases into three categories: essential (10), recommended (3), and
extended (4). In the remainder of this section, we describe each use
case in more depth. We also provide example tasks that could be
leveraged in a usability study to examine these use cases.
2.1 Essential Use Cases
Essential use cases focus on the core password management lifecy-
cle, and each is supported in some fashion by all the managers we
examined.1
(E1) Setup manager: Users need to install and configure their
password manager for first-time use. Sometimes this involves in-
stalling new software (an app or a browser extension), but it can
also include enabling functionality built into the browser or operat-
ing system. For most managers, it also includes setting up an online
account to support credential syncing.
1The one exception to this rule is the Edge browser manager, which does not support
password generation.

Tasks to explore this use case include setting up a new manager
for the first time and setting it up on secondary devices.
