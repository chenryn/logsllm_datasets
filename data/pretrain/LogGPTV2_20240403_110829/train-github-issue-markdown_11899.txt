## 📝 Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)
  1. Set Fancy Zones Layout
  2. Click app and hold shift
  3. Translucent zones should appear and drag the window to preferred zone to have the app "snap" to the area
### ✔️ Expected result
Translucent zones should appear and an app should snap to that zone when
placed within
### ❌ Actual result
The translucent zones do not appear when dragging windows and holding shift
and apps do not snap
I have it set so windows become translucent when shift is pressed within power
toys so I know that power toys is active. The zones are not appearing though,
and windows are not snapping within any potential zones.
