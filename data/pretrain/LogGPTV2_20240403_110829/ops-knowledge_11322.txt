User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Puppet offloading using NGINX, 403 forbidden error I'm currently trying to offload some of the file serving puppet does using NGINX (As displayed here http://www.masterzen.fr/2010/03/21/more-puppet-offloading/), however I keep having 403 errors on both file and catalog retrieval.

One thing that did fix it was adding "auth any" to the first definition in my auth.conf yet as far as I'm aware that would disable client verification completely?

So am I not passing all the needed headers with NGINX or is there something else wrong? Config files follow.

/etc/puppet/puppet.conf

[main]
logdir = /var/log/puppet
rundir = /var/run/puppet
ssldir = $vardir/ssl
server = Puppet.xServ
pluginsync=false


    external_nodes = /usr/sbin/external_nodes
    node_terminus = exec

    [master]
    certname = puppet.xserv


[agent]
classfile = $vardir/classes.txt
localconfig = $vardir/localconfig

Assistant: Puppet authentication is based on the IP of origin, not on what a header file is saying. After all, header files are easily faked. I don't know if Puppet can be configured to take the IP it checks from a header file.
