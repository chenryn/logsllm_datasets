User: I have a program that take one argument.
I need to call this program in my python script and I need to pass the argument in bytecode format (like \x42\x43).
Directly in bash, I can do like this and it does work:
./myprogram $'\x42\x43'
But with subprocess.call it doesn't work:
subprocess.call(["myprogram", "$'\x42\x43'"])
Bytes are not intrepreted.
I try to call my program with /bin/bash but my program returns a segfault!
Assistant: A quick thing to note: $ is a bash construct. It is the one which evaluates the variable and returns it's value. This does not happen in general when calling one program from another program. So when you invoke myprogram it is up to you to provide all the arguments in a form in which myprogram understands them.
