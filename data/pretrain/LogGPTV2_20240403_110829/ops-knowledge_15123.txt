User: Please explain the DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack method in network attacks and how to defend against it.
Assistant: DDoS attack is an attack method that sends a large number of requests to the target server, making it beyond its processing capacity and unable to work normally. Attackers usually use a large number of machines or network nodes to send requests to the target server at the same time, so that the bandwidth, processor and other resources of the server are overwhelmed, and services cannot be provided to users normally, resulting in unavailable or extremely slow response of the attacked service. Methods to defend against DDoS attacks include: 1. Enhance network bandwidth and processing capabilities - by purchasing high-bandwidth, high-configuration servers or using CDN, etc., increase server capacity and processing speed, so as to better resist attacks when attacked flow. 2. Introduce traffic management and filtering - Mitigate the impact of attacks and maintain the availability of normal services as much as possible by restricting, filtering, or clearing abnormal traffic. Firewall, IDS\IPS, packet filter and other technologies can be used for traffic management and filtering. 3. Segment the network - Segment the server and network into different segments and restrict access to internal resources to improve network security and protect the network from DDoS attacks. 4. Using a professional DDoS defense system – using intelligent computing capabilities and high-speed routing that depend on a professional DDoS defense system, it can effectively identify, locate and isolate DDoS attacks to ensure the security that the protection system deserves. 5. Third-party cloud protection – hosted on the cloud, eliminating DDoS risks. The third-party cloud protection provides DDoS attack interception service, which can detect attack behavior in real time and block it immediately, so as not to affect the access of normal users.
