I have identified an issue in TensorFlow, which is documented in [tensorflow/tensorflow#50612](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/50612). I have also submitted a pull request (PR) to address this issue, which can be found at [tensorflow/tensorflow#50844](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50844).

The Keras-related issues have been resolved in the PR. If it is necessary, I can create a duplicate issue for further discussion.
