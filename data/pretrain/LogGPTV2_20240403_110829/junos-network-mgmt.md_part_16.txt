To create a system log entry when the link-fault event occurs, include the syslog statement.
To administratively disable the link when the link-fault event occurs, include the link-down statement.
To send IEEE 802.3ah link event TLVs in the OAM PDU when a link-fault event occurs, include the send-
critical-event statement.
NOTE: If multiple actions are specified in the action profile, all of the actions are executed in no
particular order.

Monitoring the Loss of Link Adjacency
You can specify actions be taken when link adjacency is lost. When link adjacency is lost, the system
takes the action defined in the action statement of the action profile.
To configure the system to take action when link adjacency is lost, include the link-adjacency-loss
statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management action-profile profile-name event]
hierarchy level:

Monitoring Protocol Status
The CCC-DOWN flag is associated with a circuit cross-connect (CCC) connection, Layer 2 circuit, and
Layer 2 VPN, which send the CCC-DOWN status to the kernel. The CCC-DOWN flag indicates that the
CCC is down. The CCC-DOWN status is sent to the kernel when the CCC connection, Layer 2 circuit, or
Layer 2 VPN is down. This in turn, brings down the CE-facing PE interface associated with the CCC
connection, Layer 2 circuit, or Layer 2 VPN.
When the CCC-DOWN flag is signaled to the IEEE 802.3ah protocol, the system takes the action
defined in the action statement of the action profile. For additional information about Layer 2 circuits,
see the Junos OS Layer 2 Circuits User Guide, Junos OS VPNs Configuration Guide.
To monitor the IEEE 802.3ah protocol, on the CE-facing PE interface, include the protocol-down statement
at the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management action-profile profile-name event] hierarchy level:
1. In configuration mode, go to the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management action-profile profile-
name event] hierarchy level.

2. Include the protocol-down statement.

specified action is taken.

Enabling Dying Gasp Functionality | 156
Use this topic to understand more about remote faults and how they are detected and also how to
enable the dying gasp feature to avoid file system corruption for LFM.
Detecting Remote Faults
Fault detection is either based on flags or fault event type, length, and values (TLVs) received in OAM
protocol data units (PDUs). Flags that trigger a link fault are:
156
• Critical Event
• Dying Gasp
• Link Fault
The link event TLVs are sent by the remote DTE by means of event notification PDUs. Link event TLVs
are:
• Errored Symbol Period Event
• Errored Frame Event
• Errored Frame Period Event
• Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event

Configuring IEEE 802.3ah OAM Link-Fault Management
Enabling Dying Gasp Functionality
Dying gasp means an unrecoverable condition such as a power failure. In this condition, the local peer
informs the remote peer about the failure state. When the remote peer receives a dying-gasp PDU, it
takes an action corresponding to the action profile configured with the link-adjacency-loss event. Dying
gasp helps to avoid file system corruption.
NOTE: ACX5096 and ACX5048 routers do not support dying-gasp.
ACX Series routers can generate and receive dying-gasp packets. When LFM is configured on an
interface, a dying-gasp PDU is generated for the interface on the following failure conditions:
• Power failure
• Packet Forwarding Engine panic or a crash
ACX Series routers support the following CLI statements to enable dying-gasp functionality:
• dgasp-int—Enables dying-gasp functionality.
• dgasp-usb—Resets USB port during dying-gasp event.
157
The dgasp-int and dgasp-usb CLI statements are added under the [edit system] hierarchy to enable dying-
gasp functionality.
To enable dying-gasp functionality, you need to configure the dgasp-int and dgasp-usb CLI statements as
shown below:
root@host% cli
root@host> configure
Entering configuration mode
[edit]
root@host# set system dgasp-int
[edit]
root@host# set system dgasp-usb
[edit]
root@host# commit
commit complete
[edit]
root@host# show system
dgasp-int;
dgasp-usb;
The dying-gasp functionality is disabled by default.

Example: Configuring Ethernet LFM with Loopback Support | 163
Use this topic to understand what happens when you set a remote interfaces in loopback mode and how
to enable remote loopback. You can also learn how to enable nonstop routing for LFM.
Setting a Remote Interface into Loopback Mode
You can configure the software to set the remote DTE into loopback mode on the following interfaces:
• IQ2 and IQ2-E Gigabit Ethernet interfaces
• Ethernet interfaces on the MX Series routers or EX Series switches
Junos OS can place a remote DTE into loopback mode (if remote-loopback mode is supported by the
remote DTE). When you place a remote DTE into loopback mode, the interface receives the remote-
loopback request and puts the interface into remote-loopback mode. When the interface is in remote-
loopback mode, all frames except OAM PDUs are looped back without any changes made to the frames.
OAM PDUs continue to be sent to the management plane and processed.
To configure remote loopback, include the remote-loopback statement at the [edit protocol oam ethernet link-
fault-management interface interface-name] hierarchy level:
[edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name]
remote-loopback;
To take the remote DTE out of loopback mode, remove the remote-loopback statement from the
configuration.
SEE ALSO
remote-loopback
159
Enabling Remote Loopback Support on the Local Interface
You can allow a remote DTE to set a local interface into remote loopback mode on IQ2 and IQ2-E
Gigabit Ethernet interfaces and all Ethernet interfaces on the MX Series routers and EX Series switches.
When a remote-loopback request is sent by a remote DTE, the Junos OS places the local interface into
loopback mode. When an interface is in loopback mode, all frames except OAM PDUs are looped back
without any changes to the frames. OAM PDUs continue to be sent to the management plane and
processed. By default, the remote loopback feature is not enabled.
To enable remote loopback, include the allow-remote-loopback statement at the [edit protocol oam ethernet
link-fault-management interface interface-name negotiation-options] hierarchy level:
[edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name negotiation-options]
allow-remote-loopback;
NOTE: Activation of OAM remote loopback may result in data frame loss.
SEE ALSO
allow-remote-loopback
Enabling Nonstop Routing for Ethernet Link Fault Management on Backup Routers
Starting in Junos OS Release 17.3R1, the Ethernet link fault management daemon (lfmd) runs on the
backup Routing Engine as well when graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) is configured. When the
lfmd daemon runs on the backup Routing Engine as well, the link fault management states are kept in
sync and so minimal effort is required by the lfmd daemon post switch over.
To enable Nonstop routing for Ethernet LFM on backup routers:
1. Enable graceful Routing Engine switchover. By default, GRES is disabled. To enable GRES, include the
graceful-switchover statement at the [edit chassis redundancy] hierarchy level. By default, Nonstop
routing is disabled. When you enable GRES, NSR is enabled.
[edit chassis redundancy]
user@host# set graceful-switchover
160
2. Synchronize the Routing Engine configuration. To synchronize the primary Routing Engine
configuration with the backup, include the synchronize statement at the [edit system] hierarchy level.
[edit system]
user@host# set commit synchronize
3. After enabling nonstop routing, commit the configuration.
[edit routing options]
user@host# commit
4. To verify if nonstop routing is enabled on the backup router, at the operational mode, use the show oam
ethernet link-fault-management command on the primary router and then the backup router. Because
you have enabled synchronization, the output of the primary router and the backup router is
identical. However, the statistics maintained by the primary router are not synchronized with the
backup router..

Example: Configuring Ethernet LFM with Loopback Support
In this example, LFM is configured between provider edge (PE) router and the customer edge (CE)
router. The PE router can put the CE router in remote loopback mode. This allows the PE to have all the
traffic sent to the CE router looped back for diagnostics purposes, as shown in Figure 16 on page 164.
164
Figure 16: Ethernet LFM with Loopback Support
To configure LFM between a PE router and a CE router:
1. Configure LFM loopback on the PE router:
[edit]
interfaces ge-1/0/0 {
unit 0 {
family inet {
address 11.11.11.1/24;
}
}
}

}
}
}
}
}
2. Configure LFM loopback on the CE router:
