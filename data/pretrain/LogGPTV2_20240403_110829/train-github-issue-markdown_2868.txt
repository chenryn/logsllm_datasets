The location of apiserver auth certs and keys and the kube-apiserver SSH keys
are inconsistent between Debian and GCI. This means that master upgrades from
Debian to GCI are broken.
In Debian, Salt puts these files in `master-pd/srv/kubernetes` (via
`/srv/salt-overlay/salt/kube-apiserver/basic_auth.csv` and
`/srv/kubernetes/basic_auth.csv`, see configure-vm.sh and init.sls), whereas
GCI expects it in `master-pd/etc/srv/kubernetes` (see configure-helper.sh,
originally introduced in #20463).
