User: I installed Blender 2.6 and I'm trying to run a script called drawcar.py (Which uses PyOpenGL)
I looked around the documentation for importing a script and could only access Blender's python console.
How do I run drawcar.py from the Linux terminal with Blender?
Assistant: It is likely that drawcar.py is trying to perform pyOpenGL commands inside Blender, and that won't work without modification. I suspect you are getting some import errors too (if you look at the command console). Blender has it's own internal python wrapper for opengl called bgl,  which does include a lot of the opengl standards, but all prefixed by bgl.
If you have a link to drawcar.py I can have a look at it and tell you what's going on.
