### Movement and Keypoint Generation

Movements, which primarily involve the upper body and limbs (such as hands, shoulders, arms, and legs), do not have essential differences in terms of DeShaNet keypoint generation. This similarity ultimately results in comparable recognition accuracy across different activities.

#### Privacy Threats in Smart Homes

Privacy in the home has long been a concern for many, though most people are often unaware of the potential sources of these threats. Choe et al. [9] conducted a survey that identified over 1,400 private behaviors and activities that individuals do not want to be exposed at home. Zheng et al. [47] investigated people's awareness of the capabilities of smart home devices and found that most individuals fail to recognize the potential security and privacy risks. As the smart home ecosystem evolves, new privacy threats emerge, often leveraging novel techniques. For example, LiShield [48] addresses privacy leakage due to unauthorized cameras by using a smart LED to corrupt the camera image sensor. Sami et al. [31] use lidar on sweeping robots to detect tiny vibrations caused by speech and decode the speech. However, such attacks require hacking into smart home devices. Xu et al. [41] demonstrated that TV illumination projected on window curtains can expose the content being watched. In contrast, the IRSA attacker does not need to access any devices in the subject’s home but can still reveal the subject’s physical activities, posing a greater threat.

#### Shadow Detection Applications

In computer vision, shadows are typically considered image noise, and previous work has focused on removing them from images. Zheng et al. [46] proposed a distraction-aware shadow detection scheme to remove ambiguous shadows where the visual appearances of shadow and non-shadow regions are similar. Wang et al. [39] further used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately remove shadows. Recently, visible light shadows have also been leveraged in visual sensing applications. For instance, Li et al. [19] realized sparse body skeleton detection (five joints in total) through shadows projected on the floor and used ordinary table lamp shadows to identify hand poses [20]. Nguyen et al. [24] used ceiling light shadows for coarse-grained human occupancy detection. In contrast, the proposed IRSA needs to accurately reconstruct 3D body keypoints from shadows, facing the unique challenge of shadow deformation.

#### Video Keypoint Detection

Keypoint detection has been an active research area in computer vision. Early solutions [7] focused on real-time multi-person keypoint detection. The 3D Mask R-CNN model [11] represents the state-of-the-art in terms of detection accuracy. Various aspects of keypoint detection tasks have been explored, such as solving severe occlusion [8] and deformation [34]. These solutions mainly leverage prior knowledge of the human body structure. More recently, an unsupervised keypoint detection scheme [17] was proposed to eliminate the need for labeled data. Mehta et al. [21] proposed predicting 3D skeletons directly from RGB videos. However, existing keypoint detection schemes are based on RGB videos and cannot be directly applied to shadow keypoint detection in IRSA. This is because the prior knowledge of human body structures is less informative for shadows, especially when the projection surface (e.g., window curtains) severely deforms the shadows.

### 9. Discussion

#### Defending Against IRSA

A straightforward method to prevent IRSA is to ensure that the curtain and window fall outside the security camera’s field of view, so no IR shadow can be projected onto the curtain surface. However, not all users may be aware of IRSA, making it desirable to prevent it from the source, i.e., security cameras and other IR devices. One potential solution is to require the IR light source to emit special light patterns instead of simple solid or dot patterns. The IR source can periodically project random light patterns known only to the legitimate camera (often co-located with the light source). Each pattern covers parts of the field-of-view, and different patterns are complementary in space. The legitimate camera then assembles all the image frames within one period to reconstruct a complete frame. From the attacker’s perspective, it is infeasible to acquire complete shadows because only small parts of the shadow are created each time.

#### System Limitations

Although we have extensively evaluated IRSA in various situations, some limitations still exist. First, the current attack system is only applicable to a single subject, as DeShaNet only supports single-person shadow detection. This limitation can potentially be addressed by fusing the tube proposal module of the 3D Mask R-CNN with DeShaNet. Second, the keypoint coverage is low, with only nine keypoints in total, which may not be sufficient for higher precision activity detection, such as finger motion. A straightforward solution is to increase the number of keypoints in DeShaNet. However, the essential problem is the difficulty of detecting fingers from severely deformed shadows, which we leave for future exploration.

### 10. Conclusion

We have demonstrated IRSA, a new privacy leakage threat caused by common smart home camera devices with night vision mode. We studied various environmental factors that may hinder the attack, including curtain deformation, IR distance/angles, and limb length. We further propose DeShaNet and a scene constructor to recover subtle 3D skeletons from deformed IR shadows, revealing the victim’s behaviors more delicately. We hope this study draws attention to the invisible IR side channel that security cameras (or other IR light sources like Kinect) leak, which can cause severe privacy issues. Additionally, we believe manufacturers of indoor security cameras need to act immediately to install defense mechanisms to thwart IRSA.
