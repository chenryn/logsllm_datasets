movement, which mainly focus on the upper body and limbs, such
as hands, shoulders, arms and legs. Therefore, the two categories
of activities do not have essential differences with respect to the
DeShaNet keypoint generation, which ultimately results in similar
recognition accuracy.
8 RELATED WORK
Privacy threats for smart homes. Privacy at home has always
been a concern for many people, although most people are unaware
of the potential sources of threats. Choe et al. [9] conducted a survey
which revealed over 1400 private behaviors/activities that people do
not want to be exposed at home. Zheng et al. [47] investigated peo-
ple‚Äôs awareness of smart home devices‚Äô capabilities, and found that
most people failed to pay attention to the potential security/privacy
threats. As the smart home ecosystem evolves, new privacy threats
begin to emerge, often relying on novel techniques. For instance,

LiShield [48] addresses the privacy leakage due to unauthorized
cameras, by using a smart LED to corrupt the camera image sensor.
Sami et al. [31] use the lidar on sweeping robots to detect tiny vi-
bration of objects caused by speech and in turn decode the speech.
However, such attacks require hacking into smart home devices.
Xu et al. [41] showed that TV illumination projected on window
curtains can expose the TV content that people are watching. In
contrast, the IRSA attacker does not need to access any devices
in the subject‚Äôs home, but can still reveal the subject‚Äôs physical
activities at home, thus posing a greater threat.
Shadow detection based applications. In computer vision ap-
plications, shadows are usually regarded as image noise, so previous
related work mainly studied how to remove shadows from images.
Zheng et al. [46] proposed a distraction-aware shadow detection
scheme to remove ambiguous shadows where the visual appear-
ances of shadow and non-shadow regions are similar. Wang et al.
[39] further use generative adversarial networks (GAN) to accu-
rately remove shadows. Recently, visible light shadow has also been
leveraged in visual sensing applications. For instance, Li et al. [19]
realized sparse body skeleton detection (5 joints in total) through
shadows projected on the floor. In addition, they also used ordi-
nary table lamp shadows to identify hand poses [20]. Meanwhile,
Nguyen et al. [24] used ceiling light shadows for coarse-grained
human occupancy detection. In contrast, the proposed IRSA needs
to accurately reconstruct 3D body keypoints from shadows, and
faces a unique challenge of shadow deformation.
Video keypoint detection. Keypoint detection has always
been an active research branch in computer vision. Early solutions
[7] focused on real-time multi-person keypoint detection. The 3D
Mask R-CNN model [11] represents the state-of-the-art in terms
of detection accuracy. Various aspects of the keypoint detection
tasks have been further explored, such as solving severe occlusion
[8] and deformation [34]. These solutions mainly leverage prior
knowledge of the human body structure. More recently, an unsu-
pervised keypoint detection scheme [17] was proposed to eliminate
the need for labeled data. In addition, Mehta et al. [21] propose to
predict 3D skeletons from RGB videos directly. However, existing
keypoint detection schemes are all based on RGB videos, which
cannot be directly applied to shadow keypoint detection in IRSA.
This is because the prior knowledge of human body structures is
not as informative for shadows, especially when the projection
surface (e.g., window curtains) severely deforms the shadows.
9 DISCUSSION
Defensing mechanisms against the IRSA. A straightforward
method to prevent the IRSA is to ensure the curtain and window
fall outside the security camera‚Äôs field of view, so that no IR shadow
can be projected towards the curtain surface. However, not all the
ordinary users would be aware of IRSA, so it is highly desirable
to prevent it from the source, i.e., security cameras and other IR
subject

devices. One potential solution is to require that the IR light source
emit special light patterns, instead of the simple solid or dot patterns.
The IR source can periodically project random light patterns which
are known only to the legitimate camera (often co-located with the
light source). Each pattern only covers parts of the field-of-view,
and different patterns are complementary to each other in space.
Then the legitimate camera assembles all the image frames within
one period to reconstruct a complete frame. From the attacker‚Äôs
view, it is infeasible to acquire complete shadows because only a
small parts of the shadow are created each time.
System Limitations. Although we have extensively evaluated
the IRSA over a variety of situations, there still exist some limita-
tions. First, the current attack system is only applicable on a single
subject, as the DeShaNet only supports single person shadow de-
tection. This limitation can potentially be solved by fusing the tube
proposal module of the 3D Mask R-CNN with DeShaNet. Second,
the keypoint coverage is low. Currently, there are only 9 keypoints
in total, which may not be enough for higher precision activity
detection, such as finger motion. A straightforward solution is
increasing the keypoint quantity in the DeShaNet. However, we
think the essential problem is the difficulty of detecting the finger
from the severely deformed shadow, which we leave for future
exploration.
10 CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated the IRSA, a new privacy leakage threat
caused by common smart home camera devices with a night vision
mode. We have studied various environmental factors that may
hinder the attack, including the curtain deformation, IR distance/
angles and limb length. We further propose the DeShaNet and scene
constructor to recover the subtle 3D skeletons from deformed IR
shadows, which reveal the victim‚Äôs behaviors in a more delicate way.
We hope that this study can draw people‚Äôs attention on the invisible
IR side channel that security camera (or other IR light sources such
as Kinect) leaks, which can cause severe privacy issues. In addition,
we believe the manufacturers of indoor security cameras need to
act immediately to install the defense mechanisms to thwart IRSA.
