### Overview
Some Executors, currently a subset of the local Executors, run in a single
threaded fashion and have certain limitations and requirements, many of which
are hardcoded. To add a new single threaded Executor would require changes to
core Airflow code.  
Note: This coupling often shows up with SQLite compatibility checks since it
does not support multiple connections.
### Examples
  * **2a** ) SQLite check done in configuration.py: 
airflow/airflow/configuration.py
Lines 412 to 419 in 26f94c5
|  is_executor_without_sqlite_support = self.get("core", "executor") not in (  
---|---  
|  'DebugExecutor',  
|  'SequentialExecutor',  
|  )  
|  is_sqlite = "sqlite" in self.get('database', 'sql_alchemy_conn')  
|  if is_sqlite and is_executor_without_sqlite_support:  
|  raise AirflowConfigException(f"error: cannot use sqlite with the
{self.get('core', 'executor')}")  
|  if is_sqlite:  
  * **2b** ) When running in standalone mode SQLite compatibility is checked: 
airflow/airflow/cli/commands/standalone_command.py
Lines 160 to 165 in 26f94c5
|  if "sqlite" in conf.get("database", "sql_alchemy_conn"):  
---|---  
|  self.print_output("standalone", "Forcing executor to SequentialExecutor")  
|  env["AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR"] = executor_constants.SEQUENTIAL_EXECUTOR  
|  else:  
|  self.print_output("standalone", "Forcing executor to LocalExecutor")  
|  env["AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR"] = executor_constants.LOCAL_EXECUTOR  
  * **2c** ) Sensors in `poke` mode can block execution of DAGs when running with single process Executors, currently hardcoded to DebugExecutor (although should also include SequentialExecutor): 
airflow/airflow/sensors/base.py
Line 243 in 27e2101
|  if conf.get('core', 'executor') == "DebugExecutor":  
---|---  
### Proposal
A static method or attribute on the Executor class which can be checked by
core code.
There is a precedent already set with the `supports_ad_hoc_ti_run` attribute,
see:  
airflow/airflow/executors/kubernetes_executor.py
Line 435 in fb741fd
|  supports_ad_hoc_ti_run: bool = True  
---|---  
airflow/airflow/www/views.py
Lines 1735 to 1737 in 26f94c5
|  if not getattr(executor, "supports_ad_hoc_ti_run", False):  
---|---  
|  msg = "Only works with the Celery, CeleryKubernetes or Kubernetes
executors"  
|  return redirect_or_json(origin, msg, "error", 400)
