Figure 5: Relative distribution of the geographical location for
aggregator websites. The size of each dot indicates the number
of times a country is more prevalent in the distribution of
aggregator websites compared to the distribution of the top
100,000 websites.
from graph, nearly 22% of the aggregator domains are part
of Alexa’s top 100,000 websites. In fact, the most popular
aggregator domain in our corpus is rojadirecta.me, having
a global Alexa rank of 1,553 with an estimated 8 million
monthly visits5. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm that
the aggregator
domains are immensely popular and millions of users visit
these pages to watch daily updated free live streams.
Aggregator ownership. To get an understanding of aggregator
domains ownership, we performed a WHOIS lookup of the
top 1,000 aggregator domains. We found that 760 out of
the 1,000 domains have anonymized WHOIS records. For
the remaining 240 domains, 52 belong to 6 distinct groups
based on an identical name, email address, and organization
name in their WHOIS record. The largest 2 groups contain
15 and 14 domains respectively, with all the domains in each
group resolving to two speciﬁc IP addresses. Interestingly,
the majority of the domains in both groups have the string
“ﬁrstrow” common in their name. Overall, we were able to
ﬁnd 194 distinct domain owners to which the 240 domains
belong.
Aggregator hosting location. In order to gain insights on
the preferred geographical locations of aggregator domains,
we computed the relative distribution of countries in which
aggregator domains are hosted. More concretely, we performed
a GeoIP lookup for all the aggregator domains and compared
the distribution of hosting location to the distribution in the
top 100,000 Alexa domains, which we used as a baseline.
For the 10% of aggregator domains that resolved to an IP
address of CloudFlare6, we used two techniques which are
known to disclose the original IP address of a CloudFlare-
protected domain [35]. Using both techniques, we managed to
uncover the actual IP address of 233 aggregator domains. The
other aggregator websites for which we could not uncover the
IP address, were excluded from the geographical distribution.
Figure 5 shows the relative distribution of the geographic
location of aggregator services. From this graph, it is clear that,
relative to the baseline distribution of the Alexa 100,000 web-
sites, the distribution of aggregator websites is centered mainly
around Europe. For instance, we found that the republic of
Moldova appears approximately 20 times more frequent in the
distribution of aggregator services. Similarly, the prevalence of

6Cloudﬂare.com provides DNS services and sits between the visitor and the
CloudFlare user’s hosting provider. In fact, it behaves as a reverse proxy for
a website and hides its original IP address.

several other European countries–including Switzerland, Czech
Republic and Luxembourg–is more than ten times higher than
in the distribution of the top 100,000 domains. Outside of
Europe, we found Belize and Panama to be the most popular
hosting locations for aggregator domains.
Channel provider ownership. Similar to the aggregator
domains, we performed a WHOIS lookup on all
the 309
identiﬁed channel provider domains. We found that 220 out
of 309 channel provider domains have anonymized WHOIS
records. Based on identical name, organization, and email
in the WHOIS records, we were only able to identify a
single group with four channel providers that belongs to the
same owner. In addition, we observed that 31% of channel
providers use the CloudFlare’s services. Unlike aggregator
domains, ﬁnding a real IP address of a channel provider is
trivial. We inspect the media trafﬁc and in 98% of cases a
real IP was found by resolving the media-server domain, e.g.,
rtmp.popeoftheplayers.eu in Figure 3.
Channel provider hosting. Once we have the original IPs,
we used myip.ms, an online hosting information service, to
determine which hosting company has been delegated the
IP address of a channel provider’s media server. Table II
shows the top 5 hosting companies employed by the channel
providers including each company’s geolocation, the assigned
autonomous system (AS) number,
the number of channel
providers (CP) using the service, and the percentage of to-
tal streams originating from its infrastructure. We can see
that more than 60% of the analyzed streams originate from
the media servers provided by only 5 companies. Most of
these companies are based in Europe. Outside of Europe,
koddos.com, with all channel provider’s servers in Belize,
accounts for nearly 25% of all the observed media trafﬁc.
Other prevalent companies we found employed by more than
one channel provider are located in Canada, Czech Republic,
Romania, Ukraine, and the United States.
Overall, our analysis reveals that a signiﬁcant number
of FLIS parties have anonymized WHOIS records or use
CloudFlare to conceal their hosting infrastructure. Moreover,
the FLIS parties usually prefer Europe and Belize to host
their infrastructure. One reasonable explanation of this trend
can be that the FLIS parties may want to take advantage of
certain jurisdictional beneﬁts by hosting their infrastructure in
territories with complex, or ﬂexible, copyright laws [2], [44].
B. Copyright Removal Requests
In order to measure the number of copyright removal
requests submitted against FLIS parties, we used Google
6
●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●5x10x15xTransparency Report7 data that contains detailed information
on requests by copyright owners or their representatives to re-
move URLs from Google search. At the time of our evaluation,
this data contained 48,719,483 records of reported domains–
roughly 95% of the copyright removal requests that Google
has received since July 2011.
Findings. We used this data to ﬁnd copyright removal requests
against 5,685 aggregator domains and found that more than
30% have been reported at least once by copyright owners.
While the majority of domains have been reported less than
50 times, there is a signiﬁcant number of domains reported
repeatedly by copyright owners–with cricfree.tv being the top
reported domain among the investigated websites. At the time
of writing, some of the domains we analyzed have already been
taken down by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
and City of London Police [8], [9].
Similar to the aggregators, we also examined the copyright
removal requests against 309 channel providers. In total, we
found that a large number of channel providers, 199 out of
309 (64.4%), have been reported at least once by copyright
owners. The most commonly reported channel provider, p3g.tv,
has been reported 789 times–with a median value of 28 ﬁled
reports per week from February 2015 to June 2015.
Overall, while our analysis of copyright removal requests
from Google Transparency Report can not be treated as ground
truth for copyright violations committed by the investigated
FLIS parties, it clearly raises questions about the lawfulness
of FLIS operations.
C. Possible Trademark Infringements
Trademark infringements do not directly affect sports or-
ganizations and TV broadcasters in the same way as copy-
right violations, but they can have a serious impact on both
industries. The Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act
(ACPA) prohibits the use of trademark domain names and
logos that create confusion among viewers as to the source or
sponsorship of the webpage. As such, a FLIS website should,
in principle, always avoid trademark infringements.
Domain name. The infringement of domain name trademarks
can be categorized into two forms: confusability and dilution.
While confusability deals with trademark infringement in cases
where the trademark domain is not well-known, dilution deals
with leveraging the reputable trademark of a third party to refer
to something unrelated–e.g., skysportslive.tv, skyembed.com.
Associating “sky” with “live” and “embed” could dilute the
powerful association between “Sky Sports” TV channel and
“live streaming” in the mind of the average Internet user. This
practice can be therefore presumed as a possible trademark
infringement.
To measure the prevalence of possible trademark infringe-
ments in FLIS services, we ﬁrst compiled three comprehensive
lists containing the names of popular sports TV channels,
leagues, and organizations. These lists are compiled from
a variety of sources including, but not
limited to, ofﬁcial
websites of FIFA, ICC, and NBA. Next, we use the entries
in these lists to search for similar substrings in all of 5,685
aggregator domain names. To search for substrings, we nor-
malized the aggregator domains by removing all delimiters,
7http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/
non-alphanumeric characters, and top level domains. In addi-
tion, we also searched for several distinct keywords (such as
“sky” in the previously mentioned example) in the normalized
aggregator domains. Finally, if the search exposes the existence
of a clearly similar name of sports TV channel, league, or
organization, we manually analyzed the domain and labeled it
as a potential trademark-infringing domain.
Findings. Overall, out of the 5,685 investigated aggregator
domains, we found 439 (7.72%) domains using trademarks of
well known sports TV channels, leagues, and organizations.
More speciﬁcally, 176 domains (3.09%) were found clearly
utilizing the name of sports TV channels, 67 domains (1.17%)
were found to use the name of sport organizations (e.g, FIFA
etc.), and the remaining 196 domains (3.44%) were using
trademarks of popular leagues in their domain names.
Trademark logo. In addition to possible trademark infringe-
ments in the domain names, we also found that a number of
aggregator websites are using the logos of popular sports TV
channels. Under ACPA, the unauthorized use of a trademark
logo in such a way as to cause viewers of the webpage
to believe that the page is afﬁliated with the respective TV
channel, is prohibited.
In order to measure the prevalence of trademark logo
utilization in aggregator websites, we downloaded several
hundred sports TV channel logos from Google Images. Next,
we use the downloaded images as an oracle and employ a light-
weight image genre recognition method to quickly identify
the webpages that contains images of trademark logos. (We
provide details on image recognition method in Section V.)
Finally, we manually analyzed the screenshot of each identiﬁed
page to verify the presence of popular TV channel logos.
Findings. Two trends in the utilization of trademark logos were
observed. First, we found that the aggregator pages use the TV
channel logos as the link to the FLIS video page. Second, we
noticed that some aggregator pages employ the TV channel’s
logo as the main logo of their page (e.g., starsportslive.tv,
skysportslive.tv). Overall, out of the 5,685 investigated aggre-
gator domains, we found 282 (4.9%) domains using the logos
of popular sports TV channels.
While utilization of trademark logos and domain names
may not necessarily be categorized as trademark abuse (de-
pending on jurisdiction in respective territories), such practices
can easily confuse users about the nature of a FLIS service,
which can, in turn, increase the probability of malware infec-
tions, as those described in the following sections.
D. Substandard, Deceptive, and Unavoidable Advertisement
In the context of this study, we analyze overlay ads that
are unique to the online video services.8 As described earlier
(Section II-A), the overlay ads are displayed using 
elements. These ads are typically served as images or Flash
content that “overlays” the video content, usually superim-
posed on each other, running concurrently with the streaming
content. Both the aggregators and the channel providers, using
an advertiser script, can overlay these ads. While watching a
8Although, aggregators also use a variety of other ad methods to monetize
their business (e.g., pop-under, pop-up etc.), we believe considering the overlay
ads in our analysis potentially covers a signiﬁcant breadth of illicit activities,
while examining an involvement of all the key parties in the FLIS ecosystem
i.e., the channel provider, the aggregator, and the advertisers.

we again use the iframes-log to measure the occurrences and
positions of other  elements (i.e., overlay ads)
overlapping the area of Flash player. Doing this allows us
to measure the average concentration of ads presented on the
player by the FLIS services. Moreover, we can calculate the
percentage of the player’s area covered by the overlays.
Findings. Our measurements reveal that on average, there are
5-6 overlays present on the video players in the investigated
FLIS webpages. Furthermore, on average, 93% of the video
players were stuffed with overlays, hiding more than 80%
area of the player. We observe that the majority of these ads
consist of fake-button images displayed exactly in the center
of a player to trick users into clicking. As such, this trickery
directly beneﬁts the FLIS services which earn ad commissions
from unintended clicks on the ads. We also noticed that most of
the displayed overlay ads were hidden under additional overlay
ads. Figure 7 shows a heat map indicating the average number
of ads as a color strength on a player, with 7 being highest and
1 being lowest. Furthermore, it shows the average percentage
of ads superimposed on each other at different locations on the
player. We can clearly observe that the majority of the overlays
presented by the FLIS services were placed in the middle of
video players, with more than 81% overlapping each other.
Anti-Adblock. The reader may realize that a user can avoid
interactions with the overlay ads by using popular ad-block
extensions. These extensions remove advertisements so that the
player area otherwise stuffed with overlay ads can be cleared to
view the live stream. For each visited FLIS page broadcasting
live stream, we tested whether the page employed anti-adblock
scripts to identify or bypass adblocking extensions.
Findings. Overall, we discovered that out of the top 1,000 in-
vestigated aggregator domains, 163 (16.3%) employed scripts
that attempt to detect and defeat the ad-blockers. We noticed
two most commonly used scripts. We now brieﬂy detail their
workings.
(cid:5) advertisement.js. We found that several aggregators in-
clude a script named advertisement.js. By inspecting
several versions of this script, we discovered that the mere
purpose of these scripts is making a modiﬁcation to the page’s
Document Object Model (DOM). Since the popular browser
extensions used to ﬁlter advertisements (e.g., AdBlock, Ad-
Block Plus), block any script named advertisement.js,
these DOM modiﬁcation are not made when such an extension

live sport event, a user is often presented with a number of
overlay ads, generally blocking most part of the video player,
and often requiring an action by the viewer to close them.
Figure 6 shows one such example, displaying a number of
potentially malicious overlay ads, super imposed on each other,
employing both social engineering and deceptive techniques
, fake video play button etc.), while
(e.g., fake close buttons
blocking more than 75% area of the Flash player.
This practice of displaying ads not only lures a user into
