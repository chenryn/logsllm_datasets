5. Once the errors are fixed and the program is running, a DoS attack
will be launched the target website up until you exit the command
screen. If the target server can’t handle much, you may be able to
see the affect of your exploit by going to the site and clicking around.
If it is working, the site will begin to lag and it’ll take a long time to
load pages. Eventually the server may go down completely.
Perl
Running Perl exploit scripts is just as easy as running PHP scripts.
1. Download and install the appropriate version of ActivePerl.
2. Next the hacker would find an exploit for vulnerability. In this example we
will use the following example: http://milw0rm.com/exploits/6581 for
WinFTP Server 2.3.0. This is also a Denial of Service (DoS) exploit.
3. Edit the options like the target server and others as needed. Then save the
file as “exploit.pl”. As you can see Pearl exploits begin with
“!/usr/bin/perl”.
59
4. Open CMD or Terminal and change into the directory with the exploit using
the CD (change directory command). Then run the exploit by typing:
“perl exploit.pl”. The attack has begun. Simple, eh?
Python
Python is also a common programming language used in creating exploits.
You can download python from http://www.python.org/download/. The steps to
running a Python exploit are just as easy as the ones for Perl. See if you can get
the exploit: http://milw0rm.com/exploits/3523 up and running. Hint: Python files
end with .py .
C/C++
C/C++ are the most popular programming languages used in developing
exploit code. Some C/C++ code can be compiled with any compiler and on any
operating system. There are also C/C++ scripts that are made to be compiled by a
particular compiler, or in a particular operating system. You can usually find this
information commented in the top of the script. Below is a list of the most
popular compilers for each operating system.
60
Windows
• Microsoft Visual C++
• Borland C++
• Dev-C++
Mac
• MrC/MrCpp
• Xcode
Linux
• GCC
Most C/C++ exploit code is made to be compiled in Linux. If you wish to run
one them but you’re only option is Windows, then you can use Cygwin .
Cygwin is a Linux-like environment that runs in Windows and acts as a Linux
emulation layer, allowing you to run Linux scripts in windows. Although many
Linux C/C++ exploit scripts will work with Cygwin, there are also many may
not. I will show you how you can use Cygwin right after I give you an example
of compiling and running a C/C++ script in Ubuntu Linux. If you aren’t already
using Linux, I would recommend following along using VirtualBox from the
Linux chapter.
61
1. Open up Terminal.
2. Go to http://milw0rm.com/exploits/269 and copy the remote root exploit.
3. Open up the VI editor in the terminal by typing in “vi” and hitting .
You should see the following screen:
4. To get into typing mode type in I (Shift + I).
5. You are now in insert mode. Right click and paste in the exploit.
62
6. The script should have pasted in. Now it’s time to save it. Hit the  key
and then type in “:wq exploit.c” . This quits and saves the document as
exploit.c .
7. Now type in the command: ls. This command lists all the files in the current
directory. You should see your newly made file in the list.
8. Now we will compile the script using the GCC compiler, but before we
compile this script we need to first install a development package of all the
libraries and headers needed to compile C/C++ scripts. It’s a very easy
process. In the terminal type in the following command:
sudo apt-get install build-essential
63
9. This command downloads the package and then asks you if you would like
to continue with installing. Type in a “y” and hit enter. It automatically will
install the package.
10. Now to compile the script type in the command “gcc exploit.c” , it will
quickly compile. If there was no error displayed, then it was successful. By
using the “ls” command you can now see there’s a new file named “a.out”
this is the compiled script.
11. To run the new file type in the command “./a.out”. This will display a little
note telling you how to run the exploit against a server. The below image
shows all of these steps together.
64
12. The last line of the picture shows the proper way a hacker would use the
script against a server.
13. Once the hacker ran the script against a vulnerable server running
BeroFTPD 1.3.4 and the script worked, the hacker would now have root
access to the server. Below is an image of what the root account on Ubuntu
would look like.
As you can see the “whoami” command tells you who you are on the
system. In this case I am root.
65
Cygwin
If you only have access to a Windows machine, and you come across
a C/C++ script that is only meant to be compiled in Linux, then you can use
Cygwin to make it possible in Windows. Let’s get right into it!
1. Download Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/.
2. Run the installer.
3. Choose to install from the internet.
4. Continue on until it asks you to choose a mirror to download
from. Choose any.
66
5. Next you must select packages to download. Click View “+” under
Devel to expand the category. Expand the window so that you can
see all of the columns. Under the package column, search for gcc-
core and click on “Skip” to select it and click next.
6. If it tells you that you haven’t selected a couple packages that you
need, agree to install them and click next.
7. It will begin to install the packages
8. Once it is installed, double click the desktop icon and a command
prompt should come up.
9. Using the same exploit as the last example, save and move it into
the “C:\cygwin” directory as “exploit.c”.
67
10. Now it’s time to run the exploit. First you must change the
directory to the home directory (C:\cygwin) by using the
command “cd /”. Next use the “ls” command to display all the
files in the current directory. You should see “exploit.c”.
11. Now to compile the script we use the same command as we did
in Ubuntu: “gcc exploit.c –o exploit”. Here you see that we added
a new parameter “-o”. This simply tells the compiler to name the
output exe “exploit.exe”. Hit  and if no error messages
came up, then it was successful. If you use the “ls” command
again, you should see a new file “exploit.exe” in the directory.
12. To run the exploit, simply type “./exploit”. It will now display the
scripts runtime directions. Put in the right options and parameters
and run the script again. The picture below shows all of these
steps being done.
13. Once a hacker runs this script against a vulnerable machine and
the script works, he will have root access to the target computer.
68
The more exploits you run, the more you will notice that half of them may not
work. Many exploits are created and tested in specific environments and the
expected outcome only happens when the exploit is run in the exact same
environment. That is another reason why programming knowledge is needed, so
you could edit the exploit script to work for you.
Once a skilled hacker gains root to a server he has the ability to do a lot of
damage. Some of the things a hacker might do with a rooted server is:
• Add himself as a permanent user for future access.
• Add the server into his botnet collection so he could use it as a weapon
against other servers.
• Use it as a proxy to hack other websites.
• Install a rootkit so he can come back and have full control over the server
when needed.
• Constantly steel information as it comes.
• Use the system to store illegal data.
• Deface the website and sometimes the hacker will delete everything off of
the server.
Countermeasures
There are a few things you can do to stay secure from network hacking
attempts.
1. Keep all your software up to date. There will always be new vulnerabilities
coming out, and your responsibility is to patch them immediately after a
patch comes out.
2. Implement a firewall. This will keep most of the bad data out and good
data in.
3. Install anti-virus software.
4. Scan your system with a vulnerability scanner. This may reveal possible
vulnerabilities in your system.

Chapter Six
Wireless Hacking
70
Nowadays, there are wireless hotspots everywhere! You can get internet
access with a wireless enabled laptop almost everywhere you go. In this chapter I
will discuss ways a hacker goes about getting into secure wireless networks and
things he can do once he is inside.
Scanning for Wireless Networks
For this section and the following, you will need to have a wireless
card/adapter. The hacker starts by scanning for wireless networks near him. The
Windows tool we will use in this section is called NetStumbler. Also by the time
you receive this eBook MacStumbler may already be released for those of you
using a Mac. Some other similar programs are:
• Kismet for Windows and Linux.
• KisMac for the Mac.
1. Download and install NetStumbler.
2. Run it. It automatically starts to scan for wireless access points.
3. Once it is completed, you should see a list of all the wireless access points
around you.
71
4. If you click on the MAC address of one of the discovered wireless networks
under channels, you will see a graph that shows the wireless network’s
signal strength. The more green and the less spaces, the better the signal.
5. As you can see NetStumbler provides a lot more than just the name (SSID)
of the wireless network. It provides the MAC address, Channel number,
encryption type, and a bunch more. All of these come in use when a hacker
decides he wants to get in the secured network by cracking the encryption.
The most common types of encryption are:
• WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) – WEP isn’t considered safe
anymore. Many flaws have been discovered that allow a hacker to
crack a WEP key easily.
• WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) – WAP is the currently the most
secure and best option to secure your wireless network. It’s not as
easily cracked as WEP because the only way to retrieve a WAP key is
to use a brute-force or dictionary attack. If your key is secure enough,
a dictionary attack won’t work and it could take decades to crack it if
you brute-force it. This is why most hackers don’t even bother.
72
Cracking WEP
In this section we will use be using the Live Linux distribution called
BackTrack to crack WEP. Backtrack comes with a huge list of preloaded software
for this very purpose. Before we begin, there are a couple requirements:
1. You need a computer with a compatible wireless adapter.
2. Download Backtrack and create a Live CD.
The tools we will be using on Backtrack are:
• Kismet – a wireless network detector
• airodump – captures packets from a wireless router
• aireplay – forges ARP requests
• aircrack – decrypts the WEP keys
Let’s begin!
1. First we will find a wireless access point along with its bssid, essid and
channel number. To do this we will run kismet by opening up the terminal
and typing in kismet. It may ask you for the appropriate adapter which in
my case is ath0. You can see your device’s name by typing in the command
iwconfig.
2. To be able to do some of the later things, your wireless adapter must be
put into monitor mode. Kismet automatically does this and as long as you
keep it open, your wireless adapter will stay in monitor mode.
3. In kismet you will see the flags Y/N/0. Each one stands for a different type
of encryption. In our case we will be looking for access points with the WEP
encryption. Y=WEP N=OPEN 0=OTHER(usually WAP).
73
4. Once you find an access point, open a text document and paste in the
networks broadcast name (essid), its mac address (bssid) and its channel
number. To get the above information, use the arrow keys to select an
access point and hit  to get more information about it.
5. The next step is to start collecting data from the access point with
airodump. Open up a new terminal and start airodump by typing in the
command:
airodump-ng -c [channel#] -w [filename] --bssid [bssid] [device]
In the above command airodump-ng starts the program, the channel of
your access point goes after -c , the file you wish to output the data goes
after -w , and the MAC address of the access point goes after --bssid. The
command ends with the device name. Make sure to leave out the brackets.
6. Leave the above running and open another terminal. Next we will generate
some fake packets to the target access point so that the speed of the data
output will increase. Put in the following command:
aireplay-ng -1 0 -a [bssid] -h 00:11:22:33:44:55:66 -e [essid] [device]
In the above command we are using the airplay-ng program. The -1 tells the
program the specific attack we wish to use which in this case is fake
authentication with the access point. The 0 cites the delay between attacks,
-a is the MAC address of the target access point, -h is your wireless
adapters MAC address, -e is the name (essid) of the target access point, and
the command ends with the your wireless adapters device name.
7. Now, we will force the target access point to send out a huge amount of
packets that we will be able to take advantage of by using them to attempt
to crack the WEP key. Once the following command is executed, check your
airodump-ng terminal and you should see the ARP packet count to start to
increase. The command is:
aireplay-ng -3 -b [bssid] -h 00:11:22:33:44:5:66 [device]
74
In this command, the -3 tells the program the specific type of attack which
in this case is packet injection, -b is the MAC address of the target access
point, -h is your wireless adapters MAC address, and the wireless adapter
device name goes at the end.
8. Once you have collected around 50k-500k packets, you may begin the
attempt to break the WEP key. The command to begin the cracking process
is:
aircrack-ng -a 1 -b [bssid] -n 128 [filename].ivs
In this command the -a 1 forces the program into the WEP attack mode, the
-b is the targets MAC address, and the -n 128 tells the program the WEP
key length. If you don’t know the -n , then leave it out. This should crack the
WEP key within seconds. The more packets you capture, the bigger chance
you have of cracking the WEP key.
With all the different computers and network adapters out there, you may come
across a error occasionally. If you get stuck, remember, Google is your friend! 
Search for an answer and I guarantee you that 99% of the time you will find a
solution.
75
Packet Sniffing
I will be using the program Wireshark do demonstrate packet sniffing.
Packet sniffing is the act of capturing packets going through a network. With a
packet sniffer, once a hacker gains access to wireless network he could intercept
private information going through a network such as: usernames, passwords, IM
conversations, and e-mails. Let’s show you an example.
1. Download and install Wireshark .
2. Launch it and click on the option to list the available capture interfaces as
shown below.
3. Next choose the target to begin to capture their packets and click on start.
4. If you don’t know which one to choose, wait a little bit and the one that
accumulates the most packets is your best choice. Many captured packets
shows that the user is currently active.
76
5. Now to show you an example of how Wireshark can be used I will start up
Windows Live and send a message. As you will see in the image below, my
whole conversation will be captured. To filter out all the useless data and to
only display the Windows Live related packets type in “msnms” in the filter
bar.
6. As you can see, my message is displayed at the bottom. If I continue down
the list I can see the whole conversation. Usernames and passwords are
captured the same way, and if they aren’t encrypted, you can see them in
plain text.
Some other useful sniffing programs to learn:
• WinDump
• Snort
• Dsniff
