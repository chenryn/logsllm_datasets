User: Or any other normal scripting language for that matter. I know there is VBScript and JScript. But I don't really like those for any kind of computing.
I would really love to have python or ruby (or perl) interpreter installed with windows by default so when I write small console applications I wouldn't need to distribute whole python installation with it via py2exe(or similar).
Do you know if there is such incentive? Do you think this would be possible? Or it's not acceptable for Microsoft?
Assistant: Firstly, Windows doesn't need them to run, and to be honest, most people buying Windows have no knowledge of - let alone interest in - scripting languages.
It then comes down to ownership and support. There's nothing ships as part of a default Windows installation which isn't owned, designed and developed by Microsoft. They own everything, so the buck stops with them. If they shipped any third-party packages as part of the installer who would pick up support if something goes wrong?
Finally, there's the competitive advantage of providing your own products over third-party tools or packages in a default installation.
