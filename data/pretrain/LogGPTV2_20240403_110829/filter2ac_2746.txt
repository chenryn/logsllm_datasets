**Title: Exposing the Bait: A Qualitative Analysis of Autonomous Peer Communication in Enhancing Organizational Phishing Detection**

The primary goal of an information security awareness program is to protect business data by educating users on how to handle constant information security threats, thereby minimizing their impact on both individuals and the organization. While previous research has highlighted the importance of establishing user awareness and the consequences of data loss, comprehensive studies that integrate both end-user training and marketing tools to create and communicate awareness are lacking.

The Office of Information Security at Mayo Clinic has implemented a continuous, enterprise-wide security awareness program. This program leverages Information Security Ambassadors to help deliver its message. By exploring the lived experiences of this peer group, the study aims to determine the impact of autonomous peer influence on phishing detection, as compared to relying solely on technological solutions.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to identify whether and to what extent peer influence promotes learning and behavioral adaptation, thereby safeguarding users from malicious phishing attempts in both business and private environments. This phenomenological approach seeks to inform the design of a multifaceted security awareness strategy that can drive behavior change across a diverse population.
