User: I am interested in developing things for google apps and android using python and java. I am new to both and was wondering if a environment set in windows or linux would be more productive for these tasks?
Assistant: I'd throw down another vote for Eclipse.  I've been using it on the mac and I find it to be very buggy.  Not sure if that's just the nature of the beast...  My experiences with it on XP have been more stable.  Haven't had time to check it out on Ubuntu.
