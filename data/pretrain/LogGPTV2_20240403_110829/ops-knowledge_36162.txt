Question: An architect proposes that for a new secure messaging platform, the TCB should include not just the messaging protocol and cryptographic components but also the user interface (UI) to ensure consistency and user experience. Which of the following is the best counterargument to including the UI in the TCB?
"A": "Including the UI in the TCB increases complexity and contradicts the principle of keeping the TCB small and verifiable.",
"B": "The UI should be included in the TCB because it enhances the security of the messaging protocol.",
"C": "A smaller TCB would make the system less secure, as more components would be unprotected.",
"D": "The UI is critical for user experience and should be prioritized over security considerations."
Answer: A
