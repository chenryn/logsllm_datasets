**Title: A Detailed Analysis of the Mozi P2P IoT Botnet at Botconf 2020**

Since December 2019, our team has been reverse engineering and monitoring the activities and infection rates of a botnet family known as Mozi, which targets Linux-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Mozi employs a peer-to-peer (P2P) command-and-control (C2) channel based on the BitTorrent protocol. This unique feature not only facilitates the collection of intelligence on the infected device population but also presents significant challenges for takedown efforts.

The rapid expansion of the IoT sector has led to an evolving malware landscape, with numerous threats specifically targeting these devices. The 2016 Mirai botnet attacks, which disrupted major services such as Dyn and the Krebs on Security blog, underscored the potential of IoT botnets. In the years since, several new botnet families have emerged, including Hajime, Torii, and VPNFilter, all of which infect Linux-based IoT devices.

In this presentation, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the current IoT botnet landscape, highlighting key developments and focusing on the most significant botnets, with a particular emphasis on Mozi. Our analysis aims to shed light on the complexities and implications of these threats, and to offer insights into effective mitigation strategies.
