### Whistleblowers and Team Players: Islands in the Clickstream

**January 17, 2003**

It was only after whistleblowers emerged during the Great Deflation that *Time Magazine* honored the practice of what team players derisively call "ratting out your pals." Conservative publications like *Time* may pay lip service to whistleblowing in theory, but they rarely champion whistleblowers until after they have already come forward. Instead, these publications often support the conditions and practices that make whistleblowers necessary in the first place.

Whistleblowers serve as a stark reminder that ethical principles must be embodied by real, flesh-and-blood individuals who are willing to put themselves on the line. Without such embodiment, our values and beliefs remain mere words, designed to assuage our consciences and rationalize misdeeds.

If you have never known a real whistleblower, the film "The Insider" provides an excellent portrayal. The film aligns with the conclusions of a Washington law firm specializing in whistleblower cases, which lists various motivations for whistleblowing—such as money, anger, revenge, and justice—but finds that only a pained conscience is sufficient to sustain a whistleblower through the abuse they will face.

During a recent speech to accountants about ethics, the Q&A session quickly delved into the gray areas where accountants often operate. Outsiders often assume that accountants work within a black-and-white framework, but in reality, they navigate a complex landscape of uncertainties and ambiguities.

Accountants are, in essence, paid whistleblowers. They are meant to be part of the corporate culture but not entirely of it, using company books as mirrors to reveal the truth and consequences of decisions. This dual role makes their job exceedingly difficult.

The tension arises because only an individual can possess a conscience. An institution or organization can develop a culture that supports doing the right thing, but this requires a leader with single-minded intensity. Left to their own devices, cultures tend to prioritize survival over truth. Cultures reward team players, not whistleblowers. In my years as a teacher, priest, speaker, and consultant, I have never seen a culture with a genuine conscience.

A friend who is a police officer reminded me that when a rookie cop first witnesses his partners beating someone up in an alley or notices that money or drugs don't always make it back to the station, he is closely watched. The word spreads quickly whether "he's OK" or "watch out for him." Those deemed "OK" move up. My friend, a practicing Roman Catholic, noted that recent scandals in the church reflect the same dynamics.

Institutions typically encourage disclosure only when it no longer matters. For example, James Bamford's book "Body of Secrets" revealed Operation Northwoods, a 1962 plan by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to eliminate Fidel Castro by sinking refugee boats, attacking U.S. bases, and planting terror bombs in American cities. Yet, there was little public outrage. Similarly, the Church's apology to Galileo four centuries after his torture raises questions about how an institution can lose its moral compass so completely.

In Wisconsin, a friend was nominated to head a state-level arts board. His work for the party in power and his passion for art collecting made him a natural fit, but he was passed over. When I asked a confidante of then-Governor Tommy Thompson why, the response was, "He’s not a team player. He isn’t predictable."

The person who told me this was a team player himself, faithful and steady, tirelessly raising money for the party. When friends were "naughty," as he called it, he looked the other way. Recently, he informed me that he had become a million dollars richer, having been compensated at that level for three years on the board of an energy firm, recommended by his friend, now-Secretary Tommy Thompson.

Thus has it always been, and thus will it ever be.

When asked why many of my heroes, such as Jesus, Lincoln, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr., were assassinated, I responded that they embody what it takes to stand up for the truth. They were all human but found the courage to challenge the cultures of death created by institutions. Their reward was often death.

Those who articulate or embody a higher calling always inspire ambivalence. A disciple of Gandhi once said that even those who loved him most were secretly relieved when he was murdered because the pressure was off. Similarly, while Jesus as an icon is malleable in the hands of institutional custodians, Jesus the Jew was a real thorn in the side.

In an era of increasing government secrecy and the gradual erosion of our rights, it is only a matter of time before some malevolent design comes to light because a whistleblower just can't stand it anymore. Some team player, driven by a mix of motives but pricked by conscience, will tell the truth. This is the only way to ensure accountability when those with power and privilege remove transparency from government and business processes.

When a mainstream Midwestern woman asks how she will explain to her grandchildren what America was like before the Great Change, how she will describe openness, disclosure, the Freedom of Information Act, and the guarantees in the Bill of Rights, I know that we don't need a weatherman to see the storm on the horizon. The signs of the times are as clear as low-hanging fruit, ripe for the picking.

We are all team players, some of us some of the time, and some of us all of the time. But each of us faces a crossroads where we must decide if our words will become actions. It is never easy, and there are always consequences. Only integrity will see us through to the end, and none of us truly know if we have it until it is tested.
