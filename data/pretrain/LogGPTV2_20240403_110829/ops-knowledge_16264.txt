User: Provide a network monitoring system architecture design scheme
Assistant: Network monitoring system architecture design plan: 1. Data acquisition layer: The acquisition node installed in the network is used to collect various performance indicators and flow data of network equipment. 2. Data processing layer: process, analyze and store the collected data, and provide various statistical analysis and reporting functions. 3. Information display layer: Display the processed data in charts, reports, and maps to intuitively reflect the performance status and abnormal conditions of the network. 4. Early warning and alarm layer: Through preset thresholds and rules, real-time detection and early warning of network abnormalities occur, and alarm information is sent to relevant personnel. 5. User management and authority control layer: manage user information and authority, ensure data security and integrity, and support multi-level user authority management. 6. Network topology management layer: maintain the topology and configuration information of network devices, and provide convenience for network fault location and troubleshooting. 7. Automated operation and maintenance layer: Based on machine learning and deep learning technology, it realizes automatic operation and maintenance and self-healing of problems, greatly improving the efficiency of operation and maintenance. 8. Open API interface layer: provide an open API interface, support the access and integration of third-party applications, expand functions and improve the scope of system applications. The above is a complete network monitoring system architecture design scheme, and the specific implementation process and technical implementation can be adjusted according to the actual situation.
