ABSTRACT
Mirai and its variants have demonstrated the ease and devastating
effects of exploiting vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
In many cases, the exploitation vector is not sophisticated; rather,
adversaries exploit misconfigured devices (e.g. unauthenticated
protocol settings or weak/default passwords). Our work aims at
unveiling the state of IoT devices along with an exploration of the
current attack landscape. In this paper, we perform an Internet-level
IPv4 scan to unveil 1.8 million misconfigured IoT devices that may
be exploited to perform large-scale attacks. These results are filtered
to exclude a total of 8, 192 devices that we identify as honeypots
during our scan. To study current attack trends, we deploy six
state-of-art IoT honeypots for a period of 1 month. We gather a
total of 200, 209 attacks and investigate how adversaries leverage
misconfigured IoT devices. In particular, we study different attack
types, including denial of service, multistage attacks and attacks
from infected online hosts. Furthermore, we analyze data from a /8
network telescope covering a total of 81 billion requests towards
IoT protocols (e.g. CoAP, UPnP). Combining knowledge from the
aforementioned experiments, we identify 11, 118 IP addresses (that
are part of the detected misconfigured IoT devices) that attacked
our honeypot setup and the network telescope.

1 INTRODUCTION
With the adoption of IoT, there is an increase of misconfigured
devices on the Internet. Some are incorrectly configured or left
with default configuration, thereby making them vulnerable [28].
Misconfigured IoT devices are exploited on a large scale by malware
like Mirai that infect vulnerable devices with bots [44]. A device is
considered to be misconfigured if its incorrect configuration leads
to vulnerabilities. NIST defines misconfiguration as "An incorrect or
suboptimal configuration of an information system or system compo-
nent that may lead to vulnerabilities" [58]. Moreover, attacks like
denial-of-service, ransomware, or data leaks can be purchased and

facilitated through botnets. For instance, many variants of the Mi-
rai botnet and newer IoT malware like GitPaste-12 [13], Kaiji [9],
RHOMBUS [49] continue to look for vulnerable devices on the In-
ternet [44]. Furthermore, recent research shows the possibilities of
DoS attacks through messaging protocols like MQTT [87, 88] and
CoAP [91].
According to the ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2020, malware
attacks are the leading and emerging threats worldwide [16]. While
it is known that botmasters look for vulnerable devices with mis-
configured protocols of Telnet and SSH, research suggests that bot
deployments are now possible with IoT-based protocols like MQTT,
AMQP, and UPnP [4, 31, 51, 82]. With the increasing adoption
of IoT in diverse sectors like Industry 4.0, healthcare, and critical
infrastructure, we argue that this poses a significant threat.
Heretofore, there has been research on the underlying IoT vul-
nerabilities and proposing honeypots to analyze the threat actors
for specific protocols [32, 46, 63, 99]. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no work combines an active search for misconfigured
devices with an analysis of the attack trends in IoT by deploying
multiple honeypots and studying the traffic flow received on a
network telescope. In this paper, we unveil the vulnerable aspects
of misconfigured services on IoT devices and emphasize the im-
portance of authentication and authorization in IoT protocols and
devices.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We perform Internet-wide scans on six protocols: Telnet,
MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, XMPP, and UPnP. As a result, we un-
veil 1.8 million misconfigured IoT devices that can either be
infected with bots or be leveraged for a (D)DoS amplifica-
tion attack. In addition, we use open datasets to complement
our findings. Furthermore, our scan takes into account the
existence of honeypots. To deal with the lack of ground
truth knowledge for deployed honeypots on the Internet, we
analyze the response banners from our scan and the static
banners returned by open-source honeypots. Hence, we fil-
ter out from the results 8, 192 systems that we classify as
honeypots.
• We deploy six SOTA IoT honeypots, to capture and analyze
the attack vectors on the protocols scanned. Moreover, we
analyze data from a /8 network-telescope with 16 million IP
addresses to better understand Internet scanning trends in
IoT protocols.
• Combing knowledge from the IPv4 scan, the honeypot de-
ployment and the network telescope traffic analysis, we dis-
cover 11, 118 (out of the 1.8 million) misconfigured IoT de-
vices that attacked our honeypot setup and the network
telescope.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 intro-
duces the related work in detecting vulnerable IoT devices on the

2 RELATED WORK
This section discusses the related work in the area of Internet-wide
scanning for finding vulnerable IoT devices, IoT honeypots, and
IoT honeypot fingerprinting.
2.1 Internet-wide scanning for vulnerable IoT
devices
The widespread increase of IoT devices on the Internet has called
upon various kinds of research, focusing on their security and
trust [98]. The majority of the research in this area includes finger-
printing IoT devices to facilitate exploitation based on their type.
However, there is less research that follows the approach of scan-
ning the Internet to find vulnerable devices. Markowsky et al. [50]
demonstrate how to scan the Internet for vulnerable IoT devices
using the Shodan scan engine [73] and scanning tools like Mass-
can [29], NMap [47], and PFT [84]. The authors describe multiple
ways of finding vulnerable devices on the Internet using banners
of known services. The scan finds more than 1.6 million vulnerable
devices on the Internet. Although we make use of a similar method-
ology, i.e, we utilize ZMap and Shodan in our scanning approach,
we leverage open datasets and run the scans with custom probes
for both TCP and UDP protocols. Furthermore, unlike Markowsky
et al. we do not try to connect to the devices after the scanning
process. We also use the banners and the initial response received
from the hosts from our scans. In addition to results from Shodan,
we combine datasets from open projects that do not index the scan
results based on banners or responses.
Neshenko et al. [57] make an exhaustive survey of IoT vulnera-
bilities by an empirical study of the published research work on IoT.
Their analysis proposes a taxonomy of IoT vulnerabilities, including
their technical details and consequences. The authors also evaluate
IoT exploits through analysis of a passive network dataset obtained
by a network telescope. The evaluation provides good insights into
the number of vulnerable IoT devices by country, infected devices,
and malicious IoT traffic. To sum up, there is significant research
on fingerprinting of IoT devices using passive data sets. However,
there is scarce work on scanning the Internet with custom probes
to discover misconfigured IoT devices.
The work of Springall et al. [74] is the closest to ours. The authors
attempt to find FTP servers on the Internet that accept anonymous
logins and investigate real-world attacks by deploying FTP honey-
pots. Springall et al. detect more than 20, 000 public FTP servers
that allowed write access. The authors focus mainly on the FTP
protocol and the anonymous login misconfiguration that allows
remote users to authenticate without any access information.

2.2 IoT-Honeypots
The use of honeypots and network telescopes to monitor attacks is
not new. Honeypots are deception-based entities that simulate the
services of a target system. All connection attempts to a honeypot
can be considered malicious as there is no real reason for accessing
a honeypot system. Over the years, many honeypots have been
proposed, both open-source and research-based, to understand the
threats to IoT protocols. The Honeynet Project [64] offers a number
of open-source honeypots such as: Conpot [69], Dionaea [83] and
HosTaGe [90] that simulate IoT protocols (e.g. Telnet, MQTT, CoAP
and AMQP). Other honeypots include ThingPot [99], IoTPot [63],
UPot [32] and IoTCandyJar [46].
Table 1 lists IoT-honeypots and the protocols the simulate. IoT-
POT [63] proposes a honeypot and a sandbox environment for cap-
turing Telnet-based attacks. Through IoTPOT, the authors were able
to identify four distinct DDoS malware families targeting Telnet-
enabled IoT devices based on the attacks gathered. Wang et al.
propose ThingPot [99] that emulates the XMPP protocol. The au-
thors also implemented the Philips Hue smart home lighting system
profile into ThingPot that emulates the Hue devices like the bridge
and the smart lamps. During the evaluation of ThingPot, the authors
discovered attacks that tried to gain control of the system and some
fuzzing attempts. Hakim et al. propose U-Pot [32], a UPnP-based
honeypot framework for capturing attacks on IoT devices that use
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. The authors claim that
U-Pot offers high-interaction capabilities and is agnostic of device
type. The authors deploy the profile of the Belkin Wemo smart
switch [11] into U-Pot and evaluate its performance by trying to
measure the response times from the honeypot. The results are
observed to have near similar response times to real devices.
Luo et al. propose IoTCandyJar [46], a machine learning-based
honeypot that learns the behavioral knowledge of IoT devices by
continuous Internet-wide probing. The honeypot sends Internet-
wide probes as seed requests to get response information from
devices with specific open ports. The honeypot responds to the
attacker queries, using the saved responses and the requests in its
training database. HosTaGe [89, 90] is a low-interaction mobile
honeypot that emulates many protocols, including IoT protocols
like MQTT, CoAP, and AMQP. Further, the honeypot offers device
profiles like Arduino, a smoke-sensor, and a temperature sensor
for simulation. Shimada et al. implemented MQTT, and CoAP hon-
eypots [72] to observe the possible attack vectors on the IoT mes-
saging protocols. The authors observed a large number of MQTT
requests on the honeypot and requests from unknown protocols.

Lastly, we discover the Anglerfish honeypot from the results of our
honeypot detection methodology which is described in Section 3.
The honeypot is managed by Netlab 360 [1], a commercial security
organization.
3 METHODOLOGY
This section describes the methodology for unveiling vulnerable
devices and the attack trends.
2.3 Network Telescopes
Data from network telescopes has been utilized in some research to
study the scanning trends. Durumeric et al. [23] use the data from
an extensive network telescope to gain insights in scanning traffic,
behavior, and patterns. The authors reveal many attacks detected
from Darknet IP sources and derive many statistical patterns from
the scanning data. Similarly, Heo et al. [33] analyze the connection-
level log data of a large-scale campus network to study the trends
in scanning. The log data used for analysis is acquired from the
firewalls deployed in the campus network. The authors provide an
in-depth analysis and classification of the scan traffic.
3.1 Detection of misconfigured IoT-devices
We follow two approaches for the detection of misconfigured IoT
devices that are exposed to the Internet. First, we perform Internet-
wide scans for six protocols. In particular, MQTT, CoAP, AMQP,
XMPP and UPnP are chosen on the basis of their adoption and usage
in IoT [10]. In addition, Telnet is selected as it has been significantly
targeted by malware in the past [5, 6, 93]. We subsequently examine
the received banners for known vulnerabilities and misconfigura-
tions, e.g. accepting the authentication in plain text. Second, we use
the available and open network datasets to search for vulnerable
devices.
3.1.1
Internet-wide scanning: In this approach, we scan the In-
ternet for six protocols (Telnet, MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, XMPP, and
UPnP). We utilize ZMap [24] along with ZGrab [21] to capture the
banners of the responding hosts for further analysis. We use one
of the servers running Ubuntu 20.04-LTS OS with a fixed static IP
address in our lab as the scanning host. For the scan of UDP proto-
cols like CoAP and UPnP, we used custom scripts that requested a
response from the target host. For example, the UDP scan for CoAP
protocol included the query "/.well-known/core" in the scan request.
Note that CoAP responds to all requests if there is no authentica-
tion configured. Similarly, for UPnP, we send an "ssdp:discover"
request. The scans for all the six protocols were completed in a
week between March 1-5 2021 (see Table 9 in the Appendix for the
specific scan dates for each protocol). The information retrieved
from the scans, such as IP address, port, response, banner, were
stored in a database for further analysis to identify the vulnerable
hosts. The scans followed the default blocklist provided by ZMap
[100] and the European blocklist from the FireHOL Project [25].
We discuss the ethical aspects of scanning in Appendix Section A.3.
