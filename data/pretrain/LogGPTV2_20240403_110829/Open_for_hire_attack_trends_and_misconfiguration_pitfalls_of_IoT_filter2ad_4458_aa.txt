## Abstract
The Mirai botnet and its variants have demonstrated the ease and devastating effects of exploiting vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Often, these exploits are not due to sophisticated attacks but rather to misconfigurations such as unauthenticated protocol settings or weak/default passwords. This study aims to uncover the current state of IoT devices and explore the attack landscape. We conducted an Internet-level IPv4 scan, identifying 1.8 million misconfigured IoT devices that could be exploited for large-scale attacks. After filtering out 8,192 identified honeypots, we deployed six state-of-the-art IoT honeypots over a month, capturing 200,209 attacks. Our analysis includes various attack types, such as denial of service, multistage attacks, and attacks from infected online hosts. Additionally, we analyzed data from a /8 network telescope, which recorded 81 billion requests towards IoT protocols like CoAP and UPnP. By combining insights from these experiments, we identified 11,118 IP addresses associated with the detected misconfigured IoT devices that attacked our honeypot setup and the network telescope.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing adoption of IoT has led to a rise in misconfigured devices on the Internet. These devices, often left with default configurations, are vulnerable to exploitation [28]. Malware like Mirai leverages these vulnerabilities to infect devices with bots [44]. According to NIST, a misconfiguration is "an incorrect or suboptimal configuration of an information system or system component that may lead to vulnerabilities" [58]. Attacks such as denial-of-service, ransomware, and data leaks can be facilitated through botnets. For example, variants of Mirai and newer IoT malware like GitPaste-12 [13], Kaiji [9], and RHOMBUS [49] continue to target vulnerable devices [44]. Recent research also highlights the potential for DoS attacks via messaging protocols like MQTT [87, 88] and CoAP [91].

The ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2020 identifies malware attacks as the leading and emerging threats globally [16]. While botmasters typically exploit misconfigured Telnet and SSH protocols, recent studies suggest that IoT-based protocols like MQTT, AMQP, and UPnP are also being targeted [4, 31, 51, 82]. With the growing use of IoT in sectors like Industry 4.0, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, this poses a significant threat.

Previous research has focused on underlying IoT vulnerabilities and deploying honeypots to analyze specific protocols [32, 46, 63, 99]. However, to our knowledge, no work has combined an active search for misconfigured devices with an analysis of attack trends using multiple honeypots and a network telescope. This paper aims to highlight the vulnerabilities in misconfigured IoT services and emphasize the importance of authentication and authorization in IoT protocols and devices.

### Contributions
- **Internet-wide Scans:** We scanned six protocols (Telnet, MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, XMPP, and UPnP), identifying 1.8 million misconfigured IoT devices. We filtered out 8,192 systems classified as honeypots.
- **Honeypot Deployment:** We deployed six state-of-the-art IoT honeypots to capture and analyze attack vectors. We also analyzed data from a /8 network telescope covering 16 million IP addresses.
- **Combined Analysis:** By integrating data from the IPv4 scan, honeypot deployment, and network telescope, we identified 11,118 misconfigured IoT devices that attacked our setup.

## 2. Related Work
This section reviews related work on Internet-wide scanning for vulnerable IoT devices, IoT honeypots, and honeypot fingerprinting.

### 2.1 Internet-wide Scanning for Vulnerable IoT Devices
The proliferation of IoT devices has spurred research into their security and trust [98]. Most research focuses on fingerprinting IoT devices for exploitation, with fewer studies scanning the Internet for vulnerable devices. Markowsky et al. [50] used Shodan and tools like Masscan, NMap, and PFT to find over 1.6 million vulnerable devices. We use a similar methodology but leverage open datasets and custom probes for both TCP and UDP protocols. Unlike Markowsky et al., we do not connect to devices post-scan and use banners and initial responses for analysis.

Neshenko et al. [57] conducted an exhaustive survey of IoT vulnerabilities, proposing a taxonomy and evaluating exploits using a passive network dataset. Their work provides insights into the number of vulnerable devices by country, infected devices, and malicious traffic. Springall et al. [74] found over 20,000 public FTP servers allowing anonymous logins, focusing on FTP misconfigurations.

### 2.2 IoT Honeypots
Honeypots and network telescopes are commonly used to monitor attacks. Honeypots simulate services of a target system, and all connection attempts are considered malicious. The Honeynet Project [64] offers open-source honeypots like Conpot [69], Dionaea [83], and HosTaGe [90], which simulate IoT protocols. Other honeypots include ThingPot [99], IoTPot [63], UPot [32], and IoTCandyJar [46].

Table 1: IoT Honeypots
| Honeypot | Protocols |
|----------|-----------|
| IoTPot   | Telnet    |
| ThingPot | XMPP      |
| U-Pot    | UPnP      |
| IoTCandyJar | Multiple |
| HosTaGe  | MQTT, CoAP, AMQP |
| Anglerfish | Various |

### 2.3 Network Telescopes
Network telescopes provide data for studying scanning trends. Durumeric et al. [23] used a large network telescope to gain insights into scanning traffic and patterns. Heo et al. [33] analyzed connection-level logs from a campus network, providing an in-depth classification of scan traffic.

## 3. Methodology
This section outlines our approach to detecting misconfigured IoT devices and analyzing attack trends.

### 3.1 Detection of Misconfigured IoT Devices
We employed two methods to detect misconfigured IoT devices exposed to the Internet:

#### 3.1.1 Internet-wide Scanning
We scanned the Internet for six protocols (Telnet, MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, XMPP, and UPnP) using ZMap [24] and ZGrab [21]. We used a server running Ubuntu 20.04-LTS with a fixed static IP address for scanning. For UDP protocols like CoAP and UPnP, we used custom scripts to request responses. The scans were completed between March 1-5, 2021. The retrieved information, including IP addresses, ports, responses, and banners, was stored in a database for further analysis. We followed the default blocklist provided by ZMap [100] and the European blocklist from the FireHOL Project [25]. Ethical considerations are discussed in Appendix Section A.3.

#### 3.1.2 Open Datasets
We utilized open datasets of Internet-wide scans to complement our findings. These datasets provide additional context and validation for our results.
