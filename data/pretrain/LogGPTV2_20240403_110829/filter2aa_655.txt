DEFCON 18
Electronic Weapons
Presented by: mage2
Warning
Mucking about with the things I am 
about to talk to you about can and will 
kill you and all puppies, kittens and 
laptops around you. So be forewarned. 
Also transmitting on frequencies you 
are not licensed for can really piss off 
the FCC and DHS, depending on what 
trouble you cause.
Warning Part 2
This is a warning to all of those in the room 
right now. I am a horrid public speaker, I 
tend to talk fast and can easily get off topic.
Now you are thinking why is he up there talking...
Well I wanted to bring something to DEFCON, this is 
my 10th year attending. Things like this is something 
I am interested in and I want to bring my interests 
to others.  I want to make you ask questions. 
If you have a question I hope to have a good 
amount of time after the slides for Q/A, I will also be 
around after the talk.
What we will cover
EMP
EFI/RFI
Lasers
Others, etc
Electronic Basic Concepts
* All conductive material can act as an antenna.
* Most electronics are sensitive to voltage spikes.
* Most communication based electronics run on relatively low 
power signals. < 1W
* Atomic and Nuclear weapons are not the only sources of EMP.
* Voltage is based on the potential difference between the 
source and the ground.
* Ohms law , learn it love it. V over IR squared.  
* We all know computers and all digital electronics run on binary 
signals.
* This is represented as a square wave between  0v/GND and 
either 3.3v or 5v
* There is a threshold of what the hardware expects to see as a 
high or a low.
* When using transformers , you will trade current for voltage.
* RF power diminishes over distance, closer = better.
What are we working with
RFI/EMI
Using RFI/EMI as an attack is usually a DOS 
type of an attack. You will be creating a signal 
that is stronger than your target's signal.  Your 
signal can be anything or just noise.  These 
can be one of the easiest tools to aquire/build. 
RFI/EMI cont.
Here are a few of the devices that can be used 
for this type of attack.
●Spark Gap transmitter. 
●Other “off the shelf” transmitters.
●Homebrew transmitters.
Spark Gap Transmitter
●The spark gap transmitter was the first device 
used to transmit data over the air.
●It is a wide band transmitter.
●Simple to build. With components easily 
sourced.
●Easily designed to output high powers.
●Dangerous at any power level.
●Electrical arc's produce UV light, exposure can 
cause “sunburn” and damage your eyes.
Spark Gap Transmitter
This is a simple spark gap transmitter 
design.
It uses few parts, the components will 
need to be rated for the voltage levels.
Off the shelf transmitters
I thought about listing sources of 
transmitters sold off the shelf that 
could be used as “jammers” but 
decided not to out anyone.
Any HAM radio can be used,
There are plenty of places on the net 
where you can purchase “jammers”.
All of this violates FCC regulations and 
can cause you legal problems. 
Home Brew transmitters
Here is an example
Transmitters other than Spark Gap 
Transmitters can wildly vary in difficulty.
EMP
An EMP is a electromagnetic wave with 
enough power that it can create over-
voltage situations in wires and traces 
on circuit boards. This is because the 
magnetic field from the EMP induces a 
voltage on the wires/traces this can be 
100s or even thousands of volts.
What can make a EMP?
Creating Long range EMP is a difficult task. All require 
either the power grid of a small city or involve 
explosives.
Any atomic or nuclear weapon will create an EMP.  
EMP was first predicted by a guy named Enrico Fermi 
during the first nuclear test in 1945.
There are reports of a non-nuclear EMP weapon in 
testing/use by the US military during the Iraq wars. 
One type of  non-nuclear EMP weapons is called 
“explosively pumped flux compression generator”. 
Another option is to use a large low-inductance capacitor 
bank discharged into a single loop antenna.
Why do we care?
RFI/EMI could be utilized to disable 
anything from GPS to radio 
communications. Even low power EMP 
could disable a city block to a city and 
could damage the infrastructure we all 
depend on.
How would you feel without your  
latest and greatest smartphone or 
other tech you rely on?
 Protection from RFI
There are a few ways to protect 
yourself/your signal from RFI.
●Using spread spectrum/frequency hopping 
would make “jamming” your signal much 
harder. 
●For data the better your error correction 
the better your chances of pulling your 
signal out of the noise.
●Good shielding of the RF components in the 
transmitter would also help.
Protection from EMP
Shielding in the form of Faraday cages, 
and using well shielded and grounded 
chassis.
Distance from whatever is creating the 
EMP is your safest bet.
Projectile Based
There are a few devices of electronic 
origin that fire projectiles as a firearm 
does. 
These are: 
Coil/Gauss gun
Rail gun
Coil/Gauss  and Rail guns
The coil/gauss gun 
fire using a energized 
wire coil as a 
electromagnet to pull 
the projectile down 
the barrel. The 
projectile must be 
ferrous (magnetic). 
The more advanced 
gauss guns use many 
stages of coils fired 
in sequence to 
accelerate the 
projectile. 
Rail guns use 
magnetic fields to 
push a projectile 
down the rails. They 
are very power 
hungry. 
All of these devices 
are power hungry. 
They require 
specialized design 
and components
Lasers
Weaponized lasers are coming of age. There are more 
military platforms using lasers for defense than an 
other non traditional weapons. 
I think everyone here knows how lasers work, so this 
is just to point out what we have made public.
The most powerful military laser that has been made 
public is the MIRACL laser that is currently based out 
of White Sands missile range in New Mexico. (anyone 
up for a road trip?)
Just looking around I found about a dozen different 
projects using “directed energy” weapons for both 
offensive and defensive roles.
For you that have survived thus far.
Now as you have all noticed, electronic 
weapons are all power hungry 
bastards. How does one feed them? 
The parts that make them
Here are the parts that you will want 
to understand. And this will help 
clarify the schematics you will see next
Resistors
Resistors resist the flow of energy and 
convert the waste energy into heat. 
They are used to limit the current or 
voltage in a circuit.  The are rated in 
Ohms or Ω.
Here is the electronic symbol
Coils
Coils are are also called inductors, 
they work by storing energy in the 
form of a magnetic field.
They are rated in henries. Usually mH.
These are pretty easy to make for the 
home experimenter 
Here is the electronic symbol
Capacitors
Capacitors store energy between two 
conductive plates separated by a 
dielectric material. They are measured 
in Farads, and come in a few flavors. 
These are also somewhat easy to make 
at home even for high voltages.
Here is the electronic symbol
Diode
Diodes allow current to flow in only 
one direction. They also come in many 
flavors. They are used most often to 
rectify an A/C voltage and create a DC 
voltage.
Here is one of the the electronic 
symbols
Transistors
Transistors are at the most basic 
electronic switches. They are used in 
amplifiers of all kinds.
Here is one of the the electronic 
symbols
MOSFET
MOSFET are similar to transistors but 
are designed to handle much more 
power than transistors.
Here is one of the the electronic 
symbols
HV Transformers
All transformers are based on the same 
principle. You feed one side of a pair of coils 
a A/C voltage, it creates a alternating 
magnetic field thus inducing a voltage in its 
partner coil. The increase in voltage is based 
on the number of turns in the coil. For 
instance a 1:1000 would increase 10V A/C to 
10000V A/C
The most common transformers we are 
interested in are neon sign transformers, fly 
back transformers, ignition coils, and 
microwave oven transformers.  They each 
have a ratio of at least 1:200. 
There are many more parts
There is no way I could cover all the 
possible components .
Power Supplies
The next part we are going to cover 
some of the common power supplies 
used with these devices.
Marx Generator
A Marx Generator is 
use to change a low 
voltage source to a 
high voltage pulse. 
The construction is  
caps that are charged 
in parallel to a given 
voltage. Once charged 
the caps are 
discharged in series 
multiplying the V * N 
the number of caps.
example: 10 caps @ 
120 v would be 1200 
V output.
Voltage Multipliers
This power supply is similar to a Marx 
Generator
This converts a lower AC voltage to a 
high DC voltage.
Humans as Targets
The last part of this talk is about the 
new wave of using our tech on us. 
These are some of the newer “less 
than lethal” weapons that are just 
starting to be used on the public.
Less than lethal?
The term “non lethal” was initially 
used on things like stun 
guns,beanbag,tear gas, and CS based 
weapons. That is until they started 
having fatalities. 
“Heat Rays”
These use high frequency microwaves to 
produce a heat/burning sensation on 
exposed skin. It is deemed safe because the 
waves do not penetrate far into the skin. It 
is currently truck mounted but there is work 
on a more mobile option. This is named the 
ADC (Active Denial System)
Sea Sickness Flashlight AKA 
Dazzler
This uses a extremely bright light with 
a random flashing pattern. It was 
created to cause nausea and 
disorientation or temp blindness. I 
think it could also possibly cause 
seizure in those that are predisposed 
to that.
It was created by a DOD contractor 
and was recreated by Lady Ada.
Sonic Cannon(LRAD)
These devices are designed for crowd control, 
they utilize sound at high db levels (160db), they 
seem to mostly use either very high or very low 
frequencies. Low frequencies at high levels are 
known to cause nausea and vision problems. High 
frequency will cause headaches and loss of focus. 
 Not to mention your ear drums.150db is the 
point where most people feel pain.
Sonic Cannon pt2
Here is the schematic for 
a “sonic cannon” I have 
used in the past.  It is a 
555 timer in astable 
mode. I have included a 
variable resistor so that 
you can modify the 
frequency on the fly. I 
have found that tuning 
the design for the range 
just out side your hearing 
will cause amusing 
results. Tie the output pin 
(3) to a speaker. 
R1: 1k
R2: 100,00K 
Potentiometer 
C1: 0.01uF
Sound Cannon Build
I have made a home brew version of the sound 
cannon.
List of parts:
IC1: 555 timer
R1: 100k variable resistor
R2: 470 ohm resistor
C1: 0.01 uF cap
 C2: 1000 uF cap
C3: 0.001 uF cap
Speakers
Breadboard
Misc wire.
Power
Sound Cannon build PT 2 Tips
I would suggest first prototyping the circuit on a 
solderless breadboard to get it working as you 
want. When working on the final build make sure 
to use a IC socket.
Sound Cannon Build
Build the circuit as shown in schematic. C2 is a 
DC filtering cap that should be put between the 
output wire and ground. . The resistor values I 
used should give you a good range of output 
frequencies in the mostly audible range.
Sonic Cannon Done
Now you have one hell of a noise maker.

My thanks go to those that helped with
