It's currently not possible to compute the full eigendecomposition with
`eigsh`.
    >>> A = rand(5, 4)
    >>> AA = np.dot(A.T, A)
    >>> from scipy.sparse.linalg import eigsh
    >>> eigsh(AA, AA.shape[0])
    [...]
    ValueError: k must be between 1 and the order of the square input matrix.

I think `k >= n` should be replaced by `k > n`.
