### Table III: Top Five TLDs and CDNs for Domains in the Blocklist

- **.com** and **.ru** are the most popular TLDs.
- For the 324,695 unique IPs in the list, we used the MaxMind Geolite2 [46] database to determine their geolocation. 324,038 (99.8%) of these IPs were found in the database. Over 200,000 IPs (>61%) were located in the US. Surprisingly, Russia was only the sixth most popular country, as shown in Table II. These IPs spanned over 2,112 Autonomous Systems (ASes) based on RouteViews lookup.
- The blocklist also contains 39 subnets, ranging from /16 to /24. Out of these, 31 subnets contain at least one IP reachable to one of our control points. The remaining eight unreachable subnets are geolocated to Moscow.

### B. Domains

- For the 132,798 domains in the list, 49,583 (37.3%) are .com domains, and 15,259 (11.5%) are .ru domains. As discussed in Section III, 34,404 (25.9%) domains on the blocklist are not responsive. Therefore, our analysis focuses on the 98,098 responsive domains, where .com and .ru still dominate, as shown in Table III.
- Inspired by McDonald et al. [47], we examined which CDNs, if any, the sites in the blocklist were hosted on. We identified the CDN for 44,797 (45.7%) domains using their methodology. As shown in Table III, 99.6% of the domains served by a CDN were hosted on Cloudflare, which offers some services for free with minimal vetting. 47 domains showed signs of using more than one CDN service, and we counted them as customers of both.

| CDN          | Number of Domains |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Cloudflare   | 44,615            |
| App Engine   | 89                |
| Cloudfront   | 80                |
| Incapsula    | 48                |
| Akamai       | 12                |
| No CDN       | 47                |
| **Total**    | 44,797            |

### C. Domain Categorization

- Initially, we experimented with the Fortiguard document classification service [25] to categorize domains and determine the types of websites in the blocklist. However, this method was ineffective for Russian language domains, and a large number of domains (27,858 or 28.4%) were classified into the “Business” category, which did not provide much information about the services hosted on those domains.
- Therefore, we developed a topic modeling algorithm based on the technique introduced by Weinberg et al. [81]. Our algorithm processes the text received from control measurements and uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) clustering [6] to identify pages with the same topic. The steps include:

  1. **Text Extraction**: From the control measurements, we obtained the HTML responses for all 98,098 domains. We filtered out responses with empty HTML bodies, error codes, or encoding issues, reducing the number of classifiable domains to 70,390 (71.8% of the original list). We then used Python’s Beautiful Soup library [5] to extract useful text and remove boilerplate text.
  2. **Language Identification**: We used Python’s langdetect library [41] to identify the primary language for each document. Out of 70,390 classifiable documents, 44,270 (62.9%) primarily contained Russian or related Cyrillic text, and 19,530 (27.7%) contained primarily English text. We focused on these documents, as the other 9.4% contained documents in 42 different languages.
  3. **Stemming**: Before applying LDA, we reduced all words to stems using Snowball [71] and applied term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) [65] to select frequently occurring terms. We preserved terms whose combined tf-idf constituted at least 90% of the total document.
  4. **LDA Analysis**: We used LDA for Russian and English documents separately, using Python’s gensim [28] and nltk [52] libraries. We found that N=20 topics were optimal, and α was determined optimally by the library based on the training data.

- Using LDA, we obtained 20 topic word vectors from the English documents and 20 from the Russian documents. Two researchers independently labeled the topics by reviewing the top words in each topic. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Many topics were given the same label, which is a known limitation of LDA analysis. We manually merged these topics into 9 categories and verified a random subset of documents within each topic cluster to ensure they belonged to the assigned category.

### Table IV: Categories of Responsive Domains Obtained Using Topic Modeling

| Category              | Num. Russian | Num. English | Total |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Gambling              | 33,097       | 10,144       | 43,241|
| Pornography           | 5,576        | 2,821        | 8,397 |
| Error Page            | 134          | 3,923        | 4,057 |
| News and Political    | 1,883        | -            | 1,883 |
| Drug Sale             | 1,811        | -            | 1,811 |
| Circumvention         | 1,769        | -            | 1,769 |
| Multimedia            | -            | -            | -     |
| Parking Page          | -            | -            | -     |
| Configuration Page    | -            | -            | -     |
| **Categorized Total** | 44,270       | 19,530       | 63,980|
| Other Language Pages  | -            | -            | 10,464|
| No HTML or Error      | -            | -            | 23,654|
| **Total**             | -            | -            | 98,098|

- The majority of domains (67.6%) fall into the "Gambling" category, indicating a stringent crackdown by Russian authorities against gambling websites. This high number of gambling websites suggests that websites quickly clone to alternate mirror domains when added to the blocklist. This can be seen in the slight variations in domain names, such as 02012019azino777.ru, 01122018azino777.ru, 01042019azino777.ru, and so on. This also suggests that the blocklist is not actively maintained.
- Pornography websites also feature prominently in the blocklist. RUBLdom contains news, political, and circumvention websites that feature exclusively Russian-language media (e.g., chechenews.com, graniru.org) and activist websites such as antikor.com.ua, which is a self-proclaimed national anti-corruption portal. Some pages were categorized as error pages, parking pages, and configuration pages, indicating that these domain owners have moved since being added to the blocklist. These pages are primarily in English because they use templates from popular web server error pages (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

### VI. Results

#### A. Historical Analysis of the Russian Blocklist

- We analyzed the evolution of the Russian blocklist over a seven-year period, from November 19, 2012, to April 24, 2019, at a daily granularity. Since the blocklist may be updated multiple times a day, we used the latest version, typically published close to midnight. IP subnets were not included in this analysis due to their significantly greater scale, which would obscure graph clarity.
- As shown in Figure 2, the blocklist has grown rapidly since its inception in 2012. The plot shows three size metrics: number of entries, raw number of IPs and domains, and number of unique IPs and domains. Each metric is cumulative, and drops in the number are due to the removal of entries, IPs, or domains. The raw number of IPs significantly exceeds the number of unique IPs, which can be attributed to potential unintentional duplication.
- An important observation is the sharp increase in the number of raw IPs, unique IPs, and a moderate increase in the number of unique domains in the past year. This suggests a deliberate effort to increase the accuracy of the list, punctuated by drops in all metrics, indicating a conscious effort to make the list more meaningful and avoid repetitions.

#### B. Characterizing Censorship of RUBLdom

- As described in Section III, we have six VPSes in data centers and 14 residential probes. Figure 3 shows the type of censorship observed at each vantage point. We divide the rest of this section by vantage point type to highlight the complementary nature of the results from each.

  1. **VPSes in Data Centers**:
     - We observed some amount of censorship at all VPSes in data centers. Four out of six VPSes show that more than 90% of RUBLdom is blocked, with the highest blocking 96.8% of all RUBLdom domains.
     - The censorship method varies between each VPS, confirming our hypothesis that the lack of prescription of censorship mechanisms enables data center network providers to employ any method of censorship. While most VPSes observe multiple kinds of blocking, one method typically dominates at each vantage point. For example, VPS 5 and VPS 6 mostly observed blockpages, while VPS 2 and VPS 3 observed more connection timeouts. In VPS 4, TCP connections were reset when domains in RUBLdom were requested.
     - We suspect that VPSes observe more than one type of blocking due to content being blocked at different locations along the path to the server, such as at transit ISPs. Content restriction at transit ISPs would cause most content to be blocked across the country, even if ISPs closer to the user do not censor all content in RUBL.

  2. **Residential Probes**:
     - Figure 3 shows that residential probes show higher amounts of blocking overall, suggesting that ISPs closer to the user block almost all the domains more uniformly. Nine out of 14 residential probes observe more than 90% of the domains blocked, and all probes observe at least 49% of the domains blocked.
     - While VPSes saw high occurrences of timeouts and resets, most residential probes observed a blockpage. This is partly due to the fact that residential ISPs are encouraged by Roskomnadzor’s guidelines [67] to cite the law and/or Roskomnadzor’s registry and provide explicit information regarding blocking to users.
     - Probe 6 predominantly observed a large amount of connection resets, and Probe 12 observed a large number of timeouts.

- To distinguish between different methods of blocking, we compared the IPs from domain resolution in the residential probes with the IPs received in domain resolution from all control vantage points and with the answers determined as "Not Manipulated" in Satellite. The percentage of IPs from each vantage point that do not match any control IP or any resolved IP in Satellite is shown in Figure 4. VPS 6, Probe 9, and Probe 14 observe a large percentage of resolved IPs that do not match any of the control responses, suggesting DNS manipulation. We investigated all instances of "DNS/Keyword Based" blocking and found that each of the three vantage points observed a single poisoned IP, returning a blockpage.

- We observed blockpages in Probes 12, 13, and 14, specifically categorized as "Other," meaning we could not exactly determine the method of blocking. Upon investigation, we saw that Probe 14 received a blockpage when queried with the domain but was unable to retrieve the page when queried directly.
