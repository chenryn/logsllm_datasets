User:  company has multiple development teams and needs a version control tool for collaborative development. Please recommend a suitable tool and describe its usage.
Assistant: Git is a widely used version control tool that makes it easy to collaborate with multiple developers and track changes made by each developer. The steps for collaborative development using Git are as follows: 1. Create a Git repository: You can choose to create a Git repository locally or using cloud services (such as Github, Gitlab, etc.). 2. Create a branch: Team members can use Git commands locally to create a development branch from the main branch. 3. Modify files: Individual team members can modify files locally. 4. Commit changes: Team members commit the changes to their respective development branches. 5. Merge branch: After the development is complete, team members can merge their changes on the development branch into the main branch. 6. Dealing with conflicts: If multiple team members have made changes to the same file, possible conflicts need to be dealt with when merging branches. By using Git, teams can easily work together and ensure code synchronization between multiple developers.
