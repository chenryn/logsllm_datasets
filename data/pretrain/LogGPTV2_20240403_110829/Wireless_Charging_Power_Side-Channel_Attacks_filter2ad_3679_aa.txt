respondents charged their phones from 1.6 to 2.7 times per day [39].
While wired chargers are currently more common, the market share
of wireless charging has been expanding. A BIS research report
predicts the global wireless charging market will be worth over
$20.97B in 2023, and the CEO of BIS Research has claimed that
there will be more wireless chargers than charging cables by that
time [5].
ABSTRACT
This paper demonstrates that today’s wireless charging interface
is vulnerable to power side-channel attacks; a smartphone that
charges wirelessly leaks information about its activity to the wire-
less charger transmitter. We present a website fingerprinting attack
and other preliminary attacks through the wireless charging side
channel on iOS and Android devices. The website fingerprinting
attack monitors the current draw of a wireless charger while the
smartphone it charges loads a website from the Alexa top sites list.
Our classifier identifies the website loaded on an iPhone 11 or a
Google Pixel 4 with over 90% accuracy using wireless charging
current traces. This attack represents a considerable security threat
because wireless charging will always initiate when a compatible
device is within the range of a charging transmitter. We find that the
performance of the attack deteriorates as the contents of websites
change over time. Additionally, this study finds that the wireless
charging side channel is comparable to the wired USB charging side
channel. Information leakage in both interfaces heavily depends on
the battery level; minimal information leaks at low battery levels.

In this paper, we show that today’s wireless charging interfaces
are vulnerable to a power side-channel attack that can leak private
information from a charging device to the transmitter of a wireless
charger. In particular, we demonstrate the attack on the Qi stan-
dard [31], which is currently the dominant standard for wireless
charging. The side-channel attack through wireless charging rep-
resents a substantial threat because it does not require a physical
connection to a victim device and can occur without user permis-
sion or sophisticated equipment. While similar power side-channel
attacks have been demonstrated through wired charging, wire-
less charging has been considered noisy and more secure against
side-channel attacks. This paper is the first to investigate power
side-channel attacks through wireless charging and demonstrate
that practical attacks are feasible.
As a concrete example, we study a website fingerprinting attack
through the wireless charging power side channel and perform
detailed experimental studies on an Apple iPhone 11 and a Google
Pixel 4. The phones are placed on a wireless charging transmitter
and load a webpage from a set of candidates. As the webpage loads,
we record the amount of current drawn by the wireless charging
transmitter. After collecting enough data, a trained classifier can
identify the webpage that corresponds to an unlabeled current trace.
On 10-second duration current traces from both an iPhone 11 and
a Google Pixel 4, we achieve an accuracy of over 90% and when the
traces are truncated to 2.5 seconds we achieve an accuracy of at
least 80%.
Our study also shows that this power side-channel attack does
not rely on expensive or bulky measurement equipment such as a
high-performance oscilloscope which makes concealing a power
monitoring circuit in a wireless charger very plausible. In our ex-
perimental setup, we used a microcontroller to measure the current
delivered to a wireless charger. We believe that when the charger is
malicious, the adversary could place the attack circuitry inside the
casing of the charger itself. Smartphone owners will generally not
have access to the circuitry of public wireless chargers and will be
unable to identify a malicious or compromised charger. Wireless
public charging stations can be inserted in tables and chairs and
are becoming ubiquitous [2]. There are currently over 200 smart
devices that natively support the Qi standard [31], and older phones
can implement the standard by connecting to a Qi-compatible wire-
less receiver via an accessory or case for as little as $10. Given the
prevalence of wireless charging and the ease of an attack, we believe

charging side channels and shows that they leak the same
power consumption information.

battery level.
2 BACKGROUND
This section provides technical background on wireless charging
and power side-channel attacks which is necessary to understand
the proposed wireless charging power side-channel attack.
2.1 Wireless Charging
The Qi open interface standard for wireless power transfer is the
prevailing method for wirelessly charging smart devices. Qi was de-
veloped by the Wireless Power Consortium and describes the func-
tional and physical characteristics necessary to allow the exchange
of power and information between a receiver and a transmitter.
Currently, Qi supports two power specifications to charge mobile
devices: the Qi Baseline Power Profile, which delivers power below
5 W, and the Qi Extended Power Profile, which supports up to 15
W [41]. Wireless charging is becoming standard in new devices and
since its release in 2008, Qi has already been integrated into over
200 smart devices [31].
Qi utilizes inductive charging to wirelessly transfer power from a
transmitter to a receiver. Under this charging scheme, an inductive
coil on the transmitter (the primary coil) couples to another coil on
the receiver (the secondary coil). The transmitter runs an alternat-
ing current through its coil which induces an alternating voltage
in the receiving coil by Faraday’s law of induction. Additionally,
capacitors connect to both inductive coils to form LC resonant cir-
cuits and enable resonant inductive coupling so that devices can
charge even when up to 4 cm away [41]. The induced alternating
voltage in the receiving coil is rectified and used to charge a battery
or directly power a device.
Figure 1 shows the hardware implementation of the Qi standard,
highlighting the electronics between the input power and the device
battery. The communication between the transmitter and receiver
occurs via backscatter modulation and is unidirectional from the
receiver to the transmitter. The transmitting coil is powered by a
resonant inverter while the receiving coil feeds a resonant rectifier.
Both the transmitter and receiver contain communications and
control units that actively regulate the power transferred to match
the amount requested by the charging device.
The communication protocol of the Qi standard involves five
phases. In the first phase, the power transmitter sends an analog
ping to detect whether or not an object is present. The power trans-
mitter then sends out a longer, digital ping to give the receiver time
to reply with a signal-strength packet. If the transmitter considers
this packet valid, it will continue to power its coil and proceed to
the next phase. The third phase is known as the identification and
configuration phase, where information is sent by the receiver in
packets to properly configure the transmitter for power transfer.
Next, the power transfer phase begins, during which the receiver
sends control error packets to modify the supplied power. The final

that the side-channel attack through wireless charging represents
a significant security risk.
In addition to demonstrating that today’s wireless charging in-
terface is vulnerable to practical power side-channel attacks, this
paper also presents the results from a set of in-depth experimental
studies to understand the capabilities and limitations of the wireless
charging side channel. For example, we compare wireless charging
and traditional wired charging in the context of power side-channel
attacks. We find that the wireless charging side channel is compa-
rable to the wired side channel in terms of classification accuracy
despite some noise. We also observed the effects of other variables
such as device type, the length of time between the collection of
training and testing traces, and the trace length.
Our study also found that the amount of information leaked
through these side channels in today’s battery-powered devices
depends heavily on the battery state of charge (SoC). When the
battery SoC is high, the power consumption of the victim device
is almost directly reflected on the power draw from the charger,
revealing the activities on the device. On the other hand, when the
battery SoC is low, most of the power from a charger is used to
charge the battery. In that sense, we found that devices are far more
vulnerable to wireless charging side-channel attacks when their
battery level is above 80%. Unfortunately, given their convenience,
users often leave devices on wireless chargers when fully charged.
The chairman of the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) stated that
the WPC was unaware of any adverse consequences of prolonged
wireless charging and suggested that topping off a phone battery
will increase its life span [14]. For user privacy, our study suggests
that future devices may want to adjust their charging algorithm
and avoid fully charging a battery through an untrusted wireless
charger.
Additionally, we also performed preliminary experiments on
other potential side-channel attacks. The results suggest that the
wireless charging power side channel can reveal information on the
number of digits in a passcode, the number of white/bright pixels
in an OLED display, the audio played while the screen is off, and
the computations on a CPU.
The following summarizes the main technical contributions.
• This paper represents the first demonstration of the existence
of a wireless charging power side channel on today’s smart-
phones. Even with noise, this side channel leaks enough
information to allow accurate website fingerprinting.

software vulnerability.
Power side-channel attacks are a specific type of side-channel
attack that analyze the power traces of the electrical activity on a
device to extract information [21]. Simple power analysis (SPA) is
a method of power side-channel attack that infers a secret value
from a power trace by identifying power consumption profiles
that directly depend on the secret. Frequency filters and averag-
ing functions are sometimes applied to filter out noise in these
power traces [9]. Differential power analysis is a more complex
side-channel attack that allows the identification of intermediate
values within cryptographic computations after a statistical analysis
of prior collected data.
While power side-channel attacks are an established field of
research, applying these techniques to mobile devices is a relatively
new endeavor. Mobile devices are uniquely susceptible to side-
channel attacks because they are portable, continuously powered
on, and have many sensors. Understanding the extent of sensitive
information that a power side-channel attack can infer will provide
insight into security risks.
Smartphone security relies on two premises: application sand-
boxing and a permission system. These ensure that applications
cannot access sensitive information contained in another resource.
Yet, even without direct access to the data pins of a smart device,
power side-channel attacks have proven to be effective. For ex-
ample, Yang et al. [44] showed that charging a smartphone over
a USB cable exposes a side channel that is vulnerable to an SPA
attack. By monitoring the power that a charging smartphone drew,
they successfully inferred private browsing information. Figure 2
shows that in the current traces we collected, different websites
leave unique signatures through the wireless charging side channel
over short time durations.
3 POWER SIDE CHANNELS IN WIRELESS
CHARGING
This section introduces the concept of wireless charging power
side-channel attacks and discusses their capabilities and limitations
at a high level. The following section provides a more in-depth
study using website fingerprinting as a concrete example attack.
3.1 Threat Model
Figure 3 shows the threat model that is assumed for the wireless
charging side-channel attack. Under this threat model, an attacker
can monitor and record the amount of power delivered to an untam-
pered Qi wireless transmitter from a compromised public wireless
charging station. The target device performs activities that depend
on sensitive events or data values, influencing its power consump-
tion. The attacker’s goal is to infer the events or data values on
the target device by analyzing the recorded power traces. While
we assume the public charging station is compromised, it need
not be malicious because the classification and inference can occur
remotely.
Wireless charging does not require user permissions or initiation
and will begin if both the mobile device and the transmitter follow
the Qi standard and are in range (4 cm). There is no need for the
device to plug into the charging station. The target device is not

phase occurs when the receiver stops communication or requests
the end of power transfer [41].
In terms of power delivery, Qi wireless charging is less efficient
than wired charging. Wireless charging also introduces noise, and
some have speculated that this type of noise is a good counter-
measure against side-channel attacks that examine the amount
of current used to charge a smartphone [22]. However, wireless
charging transmitters do not store any significant amount of charge.
Therefore, most of the current drawn by the transmitter will di-
rectly reflect the phone activity which acts as a load on the receiver.
2.2 Battery Charging Cycles
Most smartphones use lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. These batteries
go through different charging stages [12]. The first stage, known
as constant current charging, involves supplying the maximum
allowable current to the battery, steadily increasing its voltage. Once
