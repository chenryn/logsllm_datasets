SOAP is an XML Messaging Protocol

Why SOAP?
 Today's applications communicate using Remote
Procedure Calls (RPC) between objects like DCOM and
CORBA
 RPC represents a compatibility and security problem;
firewalls and proxy servers will normally block this kind of
traffic.
 A better way to communicate between applications is
over HTTP, because HTTP is supported by all Internet
browsers and servers. SOAP was created to accomplish
this.

UDDI
 UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery and
Integration
 UDDI serves as a “Business and services” registry and
directory and are essential for dynamic usage of Web
services
 A UDDI registry is similar to a CORBA trader, or it can
be thought of as a DNS for business applications.
 Is a platform-independent framework for describing
services, discovering businesses, and integrating
business services by using the Internet.

How UDDI Works ?

Discovery Layers
Publication and Discovery Layers:
Why:
• Enable scalable, efficient and dynamic publication and
discovery (machine processable / automation)
Flow
How:
Discovery
• Use of ontology to categorize registries based on domains
and characterize them by maintaining the
Publication
1. properties of each registry
2. relationships between the registries
• Capturing the WSDL annotations in UDDI
Description
Present scenario:
Messaging
• Suitable for simple searches ( like services offered by a
provider, services that implement an interface, services that
Network
have a common technical fingerprint etc.)
• Categories are too broad
• Automated service discovery (based on functionality) and
selecting the best suited service is not possible

 Microsoft UBR returned 12 services
 Human reading of description (Natural Language) help me
understand:
 6 Entries are to get Famous Quotes
 1 Entry for personal auto and homeowners quoting
 1 Entry for multiple supplier quotes on all building materials
 Categorization suggested for UDDI is useful but inadequate
(what does the WS do?) :
 1 Entry for Automobile Manufacturing
 1 Entry for Insurance agents, brokers, & service
 Alternatively read and try to understand WSDL
 1 Entry related to security details (Human Understanding)

Benefits
Discovery
Search engines can better “understand” the
contents of a particular page
More accurate searches
Additional information aids precision
Makes it possible to automate searches
because less manual “weeding” is needed to
process the search results
Facilitates the integration of several Web
services

Semantic Discovery: Overview
Annotation and Publication
 WSDL file is annotated using ontologies and the annotations
are captured in UDDI
Discovery
 Requirements are captured as templates that are
constructed using ontologies and semantic matching is done
against UDDI entries
 Functionality of the template, its inputs, outputs, preconditions and
effects are represented using ontologies
Use of ontologies
 brings service provider and service requestor to a common
conceptual space
 helps in semantic matching of requirements and
specifications
