## Abstract
There is renewed interest in novel internet architectures that can better address the specific requirements of wireless networks, such as increased host and router mobility, and flow control over fast-changing links. However, most existing testbeds focus either on wired or wireless networks, providing inadequate support for experimentation with new network architectures that span both domains. This paper presents an initial design and prototyping of a global-scale wired-wireless testbed based on the existing ORBIT and VINI testbeds. The testbed allows researchers to define custom network topologies comprising both wired and wireless nodes and experiment with new network and transport layer protocols. It relies on virtualization on wired nodes, trading a slight performance penalty for the ability to support multiple long-running experiments simultaneously.

## 1. Introduction
The continued expansion of the Internet has exposed security and host mobility limitations in the original design, leading to renewed interest in a fundamental redesign of the internet architecture. This is accompanied by the GENI effort to provide a testbed for experimenting with novel network architecture concepts.

Most existing large-scale network testbed designs concentrate either on wired networks (e.g., PlanetLab, VINI, Emulab) or on controlled wireless experimental platforms (e.g., ORBIT, APE, MIT Roofnet, TAPs, WHYNET). We are only aware of the expansion of Emulab with wireless nodes as a first integrated design, providing emulation capabilities to test novel network concepts.

In this paper, we design and prototype a testbed that provides global-scale experimentation with custom topologies involving wired and wireless nodes based on the existing ORBIT and VINI testbeds. Both testbeds are in daily heavy use but have only allowed exclusively wired or wireless experiments. Using the integrated platform, researchers will be able to emulate real network topologies with wired nodes at PlanetLab sites around the world and wireless nodes at the ORBIT facility. The contribution of this paper is a framework for integrating wired and wireless testbeds to support Layer 3 experimentation. In our design, the wired and wireless testbeds may be physically disjoint and may belong to different organizations or parties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at such an integration.

Section 2 describes the ORBIT and VINI testbeds. Section 3 specifies our design goals and requirements for this integration, and Section 4 provides the design aspects and implementation details of the integrated solution. Section 5 demonstrates a proof-of-concept Layer 3 experiment deployed over the integrated wired and wireless testbed. Section 6 discusses our solution.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 ORBIT
ORBIT is a wireless network of 400 nodes arranged in a two-dimensional grid, developed and operated by WINLAB at Rutgers University. Researchers must use an online scheduler to reserve time slices on the grid, during which they have full access to every node. During a reserved time slot, an ORBIT user can image all the radio nodes with an operating system of their choice and carry out various experimental scenarios.

### 2.2 VINI
VINI is a virtual network infrastructure that allows network researchers to evaluate their protocols and services and runs on the PlanetLab wired testbed. PlanetLab is a global research network operated by Princeton University, with nearly 800 nodes available for use at 379 locations worldwide. Each physical PlanetLab node runs virtualization software known as Linux VServer. Each experimenter is given a sliver, or a virtualized section of a physical node. Each sliver is created on every PlanetLab node that is part of the experiment.

### 2.3 VINI and ORBIT Architectures
VINI creates virtual nodes that run on existing PlanetLab nodes. Each virtual node has access to one or more virtual network resources that can be used during experiments. VINI leverages several technologies, including User Mode Linux (UML), XORP, Click, and OpenVPN. Figure 1 shows the basic components utilized in a VINI virtual node.

**Figure 1: VINI Software Architecture**

Contrary to VINI, a user of the wireless ORBIT testbed is not restricted by any software architecture constraints. An ORBIT user has complete freedom to install and run any operating system and related software on ORBIT nodes and carry out wireless experiments during a reserved time slot. More specifically, if an ORBIT user needs to run an experiment, they typically log onto the console and use the NodeHandler to communicate with the NodeHandler Agents running on the ORBIT nodes, as shown in Figure 2.

## 3. Design Goals and Requirements
The integration between wireless and wired networks for network layer experiments needs to satisfy the following goals:

- **No Packet Type Restrictions:** Any type of Ethernet-encapsulated packet should be able to propagate between the two networks, including both IP and non-IP packets.
- **Arbitrary Topology Creation:** The solution should provide researchers with the capability to connect any wireless node to any wired node in different combinations and carry out network layer and above experiments. Figure 3 shows a sample network configuration where wireless nodes (e.g., ORBIT nodes) are connected to wired nodes (e.g., PlanetLab-VINI nodes).
- **Transparency:** The software architecture should not impose a high learning curve on users to set up these experiments and should not require extensive modifications to the existing software architecture to deploy an experiment.

**Figure 3: Sample Configuration of the Integrated Testbed**

Reflecting on the goals of this design, there are certain requirements or restrictions that need to be addressed for a successful integration of wireless and wired testbeds. Since the focus of this paper is on large-scale, multi-user testbeds that may be deployed across the globe, the notion of non-IP traffic needs to be addressed within the context of overlay networks. Overlay networks typically utilize IP tunnels, and each overlay may represent an experiment that slices the resources of both wired and wireless testbeds. It is therefore important that the new integrated design accommodates the entire non-IP packet within the overlays' tunnels.

Another aspect that needs to be addressed is virtualization. Virtualization based on solutions such as VMware, Xen, or UML allows the creation of slices across a testbed and accommodates multiple users. Experiments on wired networks have been based on Layer 3 of the OSI stack, or above. However, typical experiments on wireless testbeds are based on the entire OSI stack, imposing limitations in terms of virtualizing the wireless interface at the physical and MAC layers. To allow users the flexibility to experiment with these lower layers, we chose not to virtualize the wireless nodes for this integration but to spatially segment the wireless testbed and allow each network slice full access to a specific segment of nodes.

## 4. Integration of ORBIT and VINI
In this section, we identify the various aspects of the architecture of the two testbeds that need to be modified or augmented to facilitate their integration and meet the goals mentioned in Section 3. The solution presented below represents the architecture that proved to provide the most flexibility and functionality with the least complexity in deployment.

### 4.1 VINI Architecture Components
OpenVPN IP tunnels allow the injection of an outside computer into a VINI experiment, but with limited capabilities. The current configuration allows a single host running an OpenVPN client to establish a VPN tunnel into VINI and inject IP traffic across a virtual network topology. This limitation needs to be removed to allow a whole network of computers to be connected to VINI at multiple connection points.

In addition, OpenVPN in VINI uses IP tunnels (i.e., IP packets within IP) rather than Ethernet tunnels (i.e., Ethernet packets within IP). Modifying OpenVPN to use Ethernet links has many advantages over IP links, including but not limited to:

- **Flexibility:** Ethernet encapsulation allows for the transmission of any type of Ethernet-encapsulated packet, including non-IP packets.
- **Simplicity:** Ethernet encapsulation simplifies the configuration and management of the network, as it does not require additional IP addressing and routing configurations.
- **Performance:** Ethernet encapsulation can potentially offer better performance, as it reduces the overhead associated with IP-in-IP tunneling.

By addressing these requirements, the integrated testbed will provide a robust and flexible platform for conducting realistic and controlled network experiments spanning both wired and wireless domains.
