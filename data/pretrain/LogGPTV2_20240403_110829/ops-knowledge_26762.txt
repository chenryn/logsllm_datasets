Question: In a system where Key Transparency is implemented, a corrupt key server decides to deceive a user by returning a false key. What are the potential outcomes of this deception, considering the mechanisms of Key Transparency?
"A": "The server must put the false key-to-user mapping in the log, risking exposure when the legitimate user checks the log.",
"B": "The server doesn't change the log but returns the false key anyway, risking exposure when key requesters verify the log.",
"C": "The server can avoid detection indefinitely by using sophisticated encryption methods to mask the false key.",
"D": "The server can fork the log, maintaining different versions for different users, without any risk of exposure."
Answer: AB
