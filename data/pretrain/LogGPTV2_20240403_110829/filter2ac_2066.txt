### Title: Black Hat US-22: Déjà Vu - Uncovering Stolen Algorithms in Commercial Products

In an ideal world, members of a community collaborate towards a common goal or greater good. Unfortunately, we do not yet live in such a world. In this presentation, we will address a systemic issue within the cybersecurity community: the theft and unauthorized use of algorithms by corporate entities, some of which may be part of the community themselves.

First, we will introduce a range of search techniques that can automatically identify unauthorized code in commercial products. We will then demonstrate how reverse-engineering and binary comparison methods can confirm these findings. 

Next, we will apply these techniques in a real-world case study. Specifically, we will focus on a popular tool from a non-profit organization that was reverse-engineered by multiple entities. This allowed them to recover and use the core algorithm (without authorization) in several commercial products.

The talk will conclude with actionable takeaways and recommendations. We will present strategic approaches for confronting culpable commercial entities (and their legal teams), along with the challenges involved. Additionally, we will provide recommendations for corporations to prevent such incidents, ensuring that our community can remain cohesively focused on its mutual goals.
