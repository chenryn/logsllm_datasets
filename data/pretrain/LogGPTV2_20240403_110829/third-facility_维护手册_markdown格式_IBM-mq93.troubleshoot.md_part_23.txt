• After all of the file data has been written to the temporary file, the destination agent unlocks the file.
• The external process finds the temporary file, and moves it to the new location.
• The destination agent attempts to rename the temporary file, and finds that it is no longer there. As a
result, the transfer item is marked as Failed with a BFGIO0341E error.
Avoiding this problem
There are two ways to prevent the BFGIO0341E error from occurring:
• Temporary files written by a destination agent always end with the .part or .partnumber suffix. If
you can configure the external process to ignore those files rather than moving them, the files will still
exist in the target directory when the destination agent performs the rename operation.
• Alternatively, configure the destination agent so that it does not use temporary files, and writes directly
to the destination file. The destination file is unlocked only when all of the file data has been written to
it, at which point it can be picked up by the external process.
To configure the destination agent to write directly to the destination file, set the agent
property doNotUseTempOutputFile=true. For more information about this property, see The MFT
agent.properties file.

What to do if your protocol bridge agent reports that a file is not found
When the protocol bridge agent reports that the SFTP or FTP server that the protocol bridge connects to
returns a File not found error message, this message can mean that one of a number of different
error cases has occurred.
The following possible scenarios can result in a File not found error being returned by the SFTP or
FTP server.
• The file does not exist. Check that the file you are attempting to transfer exists on the system hosting
the SFTP or FTP server.
• The file path does not exist. Check that the file path exists on the system hosting the SFTP or FTP server.
Check that you have entered the file path correctly into the transfer request. If necessary, correct the
file path and submit the transfer request again.
• The file is locked by another application. Check whether the file is locked by another application. Wait
until the file is no longer locked then submit the transfer request again.
• The file permissions do not allow the file to be read. Check whether the file has the correct file
permissions. If necessary, change the file permissions and submit the transfer request again.
• The SFTP or FTP server uses a virtualized root path. If a relative file path is specified in a transfer
request, the protocol bridge agent will attempt to convert the relative path into an absolute file path
based on the home directory used to login to the protocol server. The Managed File Transfer protocol
bridge agent can support only SFTP or FTP servers that allow files to be accessed by their absolute
file path. Those protocol servers that allow access to files based only on the current directory are not
supported by the protocol bridge agent.

What to do if your MFT directory resource monitor is not triggering files
A directory resource monitor polls a directory for files that match a trigger specification. For each file
that matches the trigger specification, a transfer request is generated to the agent. When the request is
submitted, the triggering file is ignored until the file is changed.
Possible reasons why the files are not triggering
1.The directory resource monitor found a file that matched the trigger specification, but the generated
transfer request was invalid and the agent was unable to process the request. The reasons can include
the following:
• Invalid destination agent
• Missing destination agent
• Transfer canceled by program invocation
In all these examples, the directory resource monitor marks the triggering file as processed and
ignores the file even though the transfer failed.
2.The file is outside the scope of the resource monitor trigger specification. The reasons can include the
following:
• Incorrect trigger pattern
• Monitoring the incorrect directory
• Insufficient file permissions
• Failure to connect to remote file system
Why a file can trigger a second transfer
A trigger file can generate a Managed File Transfer transfer request for the following reasons:
• If the presence of the trigger file is detected, when it was not there before.
• If the trigger file has been updated, causing the last modified date to change.
Potential scenarios for a second trigger are:
• The file is removed, then replaced.
• The file is locked by one application, then unlocked by another application.
• The monitor file system fails. For example, if the network connection fails, this can give the appearance
of the file being removed, then replaced.
• The file directory is updated by another application, causing the last modified date to change.

Guidance for configuring an MFT resource monitor to avoid overloading an agent
You can configure the property and parameter values of a Managed File Transfer resource monitor to
reduce the load on an agent. Reducing the load on the agent improves the performance of that agent.
There are several settings you can use, and you may need to use trial and error to find the best settings for
your system configuration.
Overview of resource monitoring
When a resource monitor polls a directory or a queue, the agent completes the following stages:
• Finds all the files that match a trigger pattern (for example, all the *.txt files in the directory). Or finds
all complete groups of messages on the queue.
• Determines which files are new or changed, or determines which groups are new on the queue.
• Initiates transfers for the files or groups that match the criteria in the two previous stages.
• Adds to the list of files and groups already transferred so they are not transferred again until they
change.
For a directory monitor, the more files in the source directory and the broader the triggering pattern, the
bigger the list of files the agent has to parse and compare against the list of files already transferred.
For a queue monitor, the more groups on the queue the bigger the list of groups the agent has to compare
against the list of groups already transferred.
146 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
Consider the following key settings:
• Use agent property monitorMaxResourcesInPoll to set the maximum number of files or groups the
agent includes on each poll. Using this parameter limits the number of transfers in a polling interval.
It also means that the agent has less parsing to do before initiating a transfer for that number of files
or groups. The next time the directory monitor or queue monitor polls, the agent includes the next set
of files or groups. Agent property monitorMaxResourcesInPoll is available in IBM WebSphere MQ
File Transfer Edition 7.0.4 and later, for earlier versions of IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition it is
available as an interim fix for APAR IC78011. Note that IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition (FTE)
is no longer a supported product. To migrate from FTE to the Managed File Transfer component in IBM
MQ, see Migrating Managed File Transfer.
• When creating a directory monitor, ensure that the transfer definition you configure has a source
disposition of delete. Setting this disposition means that when the file transfer completes it is
removed from the monitored directory and the agent no longer keeps it on its internal list.
• When creating a directory monitor, use the -rl parameter in the fteCreateMonitor command to
limit the number of levels of the directory the agent has to recurse through. Using this parameter means
that lower-level directories are not scanned unnecessarily.
Further considerations when creating a resource monitor
The process of resource monitor polling consumes agent resources. Increasing the polling interval of
a monitor reduces the load placed on the agent. However, the setting of the polling interval must be
balanced against generating too many transfers per polling interval. Consider the following when you set
the polling interval for a resource monitor:
• How quickly you need a transfer to be initiated after a file is placed in a directory, or a group on a queue.
• The rate which files are placed into a directory, or groups onto a queue.
• The maximum transfer rate of the agent. The agent must be able to handle all the transfers that a
monitor generates.
The polling interval is specified when the resource monitor is created with the fteCreateMonitor
command by specifying the -pi (polling interval) and -pu (polling interval units) parameters. You may
need to experiment to determine the best settings for your configuration.
An option to improve the stability of highly loaded agents that run resource monitors, is to reduce
the agent property value of maxSourceTransfers. With this option the agent splits its processing
time between the resource monitor and transferring files. The higher the value of agent property
maxSourceTransfers, the more processing time is consumed by transferring files and less is available
for the resource monitor. If you reduce the value of agent property maxSourceTransfers, the agent
does fewer transfers in parallel, but it should have enough processing time to poll its resource monitors.
If you lower the value of this agent property you should consider increasing the value of agent property
maxQueuedTransfers because the number of queued transfers may increase.
If after optimizing your monitor you find that some transfers enter recovery, consider increasing an
agent timeout value. The heavy load placed on the agent, may mean that the transfers timeout when
negotiating the start of the transfer with the destination agent. This timeout causes the transfer to go into
recovery and delays the completion of the transfer. The agent property maxTransferNegotiationTime
specifies the time the source agent waits for a response from the destination agent. If this time is
exceeded the transfer goes into recovery. The default value of this property is 30000 milliseconds (30
seconds). Increasing the value of the property, for example to 300000 Milliseconds (5 minutes), may
allow the transfers to continue without timing out and avoid going into recovery.

What to do if destination files created by a transfer started by a queue resource
monitor contain the wrong data
You can create a resource monitor to monitor a queue and transfer a message or a group of messages on
a queue to a file. The file name can be specified by using the MQMD message descriptors on the message
or the first message in a group. If a message-to-file transfer fails and the message or group is left on the
queue, the next time the monitor is triggered it might result in files being created that contain the wrong
data.
Why this problem occurs
1.A message-to-file transfer fails and the message or group is left on the queue.
2.A new message or group arrives on the queue.
3.The new message or group triggers the resource monitor.
4.The resource monitor creates a new transfer that uses the MQMD message descriptors from the new
message or group and the data from the first message or group on the queue.
5.Files are created that contain the wrong data.
Avoiding this problem
To avoid experiencing this problem, you must manually create a transfer definition file by using the
fteCreateTransfer command and edit the  element of the file to include the attribute
groupId="${GROUPID}". Then submit the transfer definition file by using the fteCreateMonitor
command.
Example
In this example: the source agent, which is also the monitoring agent, is called AGENT_MON;
the destination agent is called AGENT_DEST; the destination file name is /out/files/$
{WMQFTEFileName}. This example requires that the message has the MQMD message descriptor
WMQFTEFileName set. The queue being monitored is LIVE_QUEUE.
1.Create a transfer definition file by running the following command:
fteCreateTransfer -sa AGENT_MON -da AGENT_DEST -df "/out/files/${WMQFTEFileName}"
-de error -gt /tmp/TransferDefinition1.xml -sqgi -sq LIVE_QUEUE
The transfer definition file /tmp/TransferDefinition1.xml is generated.
2.Edit the  element to include the attribute groupId="${GROUPID}". Change the line
LIVE_QUEUE
to
LIVE_QUEUE
This attribute is required so that the transfer reads the group or message that triggered the transfer
from the queue instead of the first group or message on the queue.
3.Create the monitor by running the following command:
fteCreateMonitor -ma AGENT_MON -mq LIVE_QUEUE -mn QueueMon1 -mt /tmp/TransferDefinition1.xml
-tr completeGroups -dv WMQFTEFileName=UNKNOWN
This monitor polls the queue every 60 seconds to see if a new group or message has arrived on the
queue.

What to do if variable substitution causes multiple files to go to a single file name
For Managed File Transfer, if you are monitoring a directory and transferring multiple files from a source
to a destination location and you are using ${FileName} variable substitution, you must test the variable
substitution results. The results need to be tested because the use of variable substitution might cause
unexpected combinations of file transfer commands to be invoked.
To determine whether the problem is occurring, look for cases of multiple files appearing to transfer but
only one file arriving at the destination. You might see errors in the file transfer log showing multiple files
attempting to transfer to the same destination file name and failing transfers to the same file name.
Why this problem occurs
When multiple files are being processed by an MFT directory monitor, the Task xml runs for every file
that the monitor finds in the directory being monitored. If the ${FileName} is only specified in the
destination of the xml task file and not the source, the transfer is invoked for each file multiple times, once
for each file name combination.
For example:
e:\temp
s:\outdir\${FileName}
Avoiding this problem
If you are using ${FileName} variable substitution in the source or destination and are expecting a
variation of the same file name to arrive at the destination, be sure to specify ${FileName} in BOTH the
source and destination of your task XML definition.
The following example takes a file from e:\temp\ and transfers it to
s:\outdir\.out:
e:\temp\${FileName}
s:\outdir\${FileName}.out

What to do if your resource monitor reports a BFGDM0107W message
A resource monitor configured to poll either a directory or a queue looks for items that match a specified
trigger condition and submits managed transfers to its associated agent to process them. Periodically, the
monitor writes a BFGDM0107W message to the agent’s event log (output0.log).
The following text shows a typical BFGDM0107W message:
BFGDM0107W: The number of tasks generated by monitor MONITOR1 during a
polling interval has exceeded twice the value of the maxSourceTransfers agent property
and the agent property monitorMaxResourcesInPoll is set to its default value of -1.
Why this warning occurs
Every agent has a number of transfer slots that it uses to hold details about the managed transfers and
managed calls that are currently in progress, as well as the managed transfer and managed call requests
that are currently on its backlog. For more information about how these slots are used, see How MFT
agents allocate source transfer slots to new requests.
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 149
By default, a monitor submits a task (which is either a single managed transfer or managed call request)
for every item that it triggers on during a poll. For example, if a resource monitor has been configured to
poll a source queue looking for complete message groups or individual messages not in a group then, if
the monitor finds:
• 10 messages or complete message groups on the queue during a poll, it submits 10 tasks (or managed
