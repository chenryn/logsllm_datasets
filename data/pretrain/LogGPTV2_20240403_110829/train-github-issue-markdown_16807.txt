Hello everyone,

I am facing an issue that I have not been able to resolve through online searches. I currently have two screens in extended mode, and I would like to switch them to duplicate mode programmatically using Electron. 

Does Electron provide a way to change the display mode between extended and duplicated at runtime?

Thank you for your assistance.
