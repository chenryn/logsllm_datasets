if possible.
My code:
      jQuery Playground
          #left-well
            #target1
            #target2
            #target3
          #right-well
            #target4
            #target5
            #target6
The Above code creates a total of 3 "#target5" elemets, 2 on the "#left-well"
and 1 on the "#right-well".

I tried refreshing my browser several times but this didn't go.  
But this keeps changing i mean to 1 element on the left then to 2 when ever i
keep typing or changing code.
