This feature was requested before #4988 but the bug was closed as WAI. I
believe having popcnt part of standard library would benefit greatly many
libraries.
For example there are two popcnt implementation in the golang tools:  
https://github.com/golang/go/blob/dev.ssa/src/cmd/internal/ssa/regalloc.go#L39  
https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/container/intsets/util.go#L22
It is also provided by several third party libraries  
http://go-search.org/search?q=popcnt  
http://go-search.org/search?q=popcount
These implementation are incomplete: the libraries provide assembly for one
platform (amd64 in the best case), may not be not inlined (function call will
dominate the benchmarks
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25471369/performance-discrepancy-in-
compiled-vs-hand-written-assembly), are not well test, or are under a
restrictive licence.
There is also a long standing bug #4816 which requests the POPCNT instruction
on amd64. With POPCNT instruction population counting can be turned into a
single instruction similarly to math.Sqrt (https://go-
review.googlesource.com/#/c/8465/).
popcnt is very often used by chess, go (the game), checkers engines, all of
them would benefit from a fast popcnt. #7357 provides another real word usage.
Also a Go developer expressed his wish for popcnt (and other similar
operations) to be provided by the standard library (https://go-
review.googlesource.com/#/c/9761/1/src/cmd/internal/ssa/regalloc.go@41).
