Table 3: Performance evaluation of Aegis in different multi-user scenarios.
install an app in SHS, Aegis searches for existing app context in
the database and adds the context into the training dataset for data
validation purpose. For any third-party app, users can manually use
the source code of the app in Aegis and generate the app context
which is later added in the database.
For collecting the malicious dataset, we created six different
attack scenarios, and their associated smart home apps based on the
adversary model presented in Section 3 (more details in Appendix
D). Additionally, we added some malfunctioning devices (e.g., a
smart lock without power, fused smart light, etc.) in the SHS to
test Aegis in cases that include device malfunction. We collected
24 different datasets (4 dataset for each attack scenario) for a total
of over 10000 events. We used 75% of the benign user data to train
the Markov Chain model. Then the remaining 25% of data along
with the malicious dataset was used in the testing phase which is a
common practice [3, 14, 28]. Finally, to evaluate Aegis, we utilized
six different performance metrics: True Positive Rate or recall rate
(TPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), True Negative Rate or precision
rate (TNR), False Positive Rate (FPR), Accuracy, and F-score. Details
of these performance metrics are given in Appendix A.
5.2 Evaluation with Different Home Layouts
To evaluate Aegis in different smart home layouts, we consider two
important criteria (1) different smart home layouts, (2) multiple
numbers of users. A SHS can have different smart home layouts
and different number of devices. We tested the efficiency of Aegis
in a multi-user environment and different smart home layouts.
Different smart home layouts: User activities in a smart home
can vary depending on the home layout as different layouts can lead
to different usage patterns. To evaluate Aegis, we considered three
different layouts: single bedroom home, double bedroom home, and
duplex home. Here, we considered a single authorized smart home
user in different layouts. We collected data from 15 different users
in these layouts. Table 2 presents the evaluation results associated
with different smart home layouts. We can observe that accuracy
and F-score for different layouts vary from 96-91% and 97-95%,
respectively. Aegis also achieves high TP (96-91%) and TN rate
(100%) irrespective of layouts. One can safely confirm that variation
in different layouts has a minimal impact on the performance of
Aegis. Table 2 also shows how the performance of Aegis improves in
adaptive training mode. Here, whenever the controller device (e.g.,
smartphone, tablet, etc.) is connected in the smart home network,
we infer the user is in home location and use adaptive training mode.
One can notice that the accuracy of Aegis increases from 95% to 97%
in adaptive training mode for single bedroom layout. For double
bedroom and duplex home, Aegis achieves 96.4% and 96.1% accuracy
respectively. As adaptive training mode uses user validation to
reduce FP and FN events, F-Score increases to approximately 97%
for all three layouts. In summary, Aegis can achieve accuracy and
F-score over 95% for all three smart home layouts.
Different number of authorized users: Smart home platforms
allow users to add more than one authorized user for the same SHS.
Hence, a SHS can have multi-user scenarios with different user
activities happening at the same time. To evaluate this setting of
the smart home in Aegis, we collected data from several multi-user
settings with different users performing their daily activities at
once. We used different smart home layouts with several multi-user
scenarios (two, three, and four authorized controllers/conflicting
users) in our data collection process. Additionally, we performed
the aforementioned attack scenarios to collect malicious dataset and
tested the efficiency of Aegis in different multi-user environments.
Table 3 illustrates the detailed evaluation of Aegis in different smart
home settings. For single bedroom layout, we can observe that accu-
racy and F-score reach the peak (0.9477 and 0.9729, respectively) for
the two users setup. If we increase the number of authorized users
in the SHS, the accuracy gradually decreases with an increasing
FN rate. Similarly, for double bedrooms and duplex home layout,
Aegis achieves the highest accuracy and F-score for two authorized
users’ setup. Both accuracy and F-score decreases while the FN rate
increases as the number of authorized users increases. The highest
accuracy achieved in two bedrooms and duplex home layouts are
92.29% and 90.38%, respectively. As different users interact with
smart home devices in varied ways, the FN rate increases with
the number of users in the system. To minimize the number of FN
events, we implement the adaptive training mode in Aegis. In a
multi-user scenario, a notification is pushed in all the controller
devices if Aegis detects a malicious event in adaptive training mode.

All the authorized users can confirm the event based on their ac-
tivities and Aegis trains the analytical model with validated data.
One can notice from Table 3 that Aegis achieves the highest accu-
racy and F-Score (97% and 98%, respectively) for two users setup in
single bedroom layout. Adaptive training mode also decreases FN
rate approximately by 38.6% and increases the accuracy to 96% and
95.25% for three and four authorized user scenarios respectively. For
two bedroom and duplex home layout, adaptive training mode also
increases the efficiency of Aegis. Adaptive training mode reduces
FN and FP rate approximately by 60% while accuracy and F-Score
increases to approximately 96% and 98% respectively in a double
bedroom and duplex home layout. In summary, Aegis can minimize
the effect of conflicting user activities in a multi-user scenario in
adaptive training mode while increasing efficiency.
5.3 Evaluation with Different Smart Home
Configurations
In this sub-section, we evaluate Aegis based on different smart
home configurations including (1) different sensor configurations,
(2) different user policies, and (3) number of installed apps.
Different sensor configurations: To evaluate the efficiency of
Aegis based on deployed sensors, we use several combinations of
sensors to build the context-aware model of user activities and
report accuracy in Figure 5. Since Aegis considers different smart
home sensors and devices as co-dependent components, we try to
understand to what extent changing the combinations of sensors
in a SHS affects Aegis’s performance. For this, we tested the effi-
cacy of Aegis with four different combinations of sensors: without
motion sensor, without the door sensor, without the temperature
sensor, and without the light sensor. As seen in Figure 5c and 5d,
decreasing the number of sensors from the context-aware model
in Aegis declines the accuracy and F-score of the framework. Re-
moving the motion sensor resulted in the lowest accuracy and
F-score (61% and 68% in duplex home layout, respectively). As mo-
tion sensors are configured with the majority of the devices (smart
light, smart lock, etc.) and used in most of the user activity con-
text, it affects the performance of Aegis significantly. We can also
observe that removing sensors from the SHS introduces high FN
rate as our proposed framework cannot build the context of the
user activities correctly (Figure 5b). Again, Figure 5c illustrates that
removing the temperature sensor from the SHS does not influence
the performance significantly (85-91% accuracy and 88-91% F-score
in different layouts). The main reason is that the temperature sen-
sor can be configured with a limited number of devices; hence, it
is affected by user activities less than other sensors. Without the
door sensor and light sensor, Aegis can achieve moderate accuracy
ranges from 77%-86% and 79%-88%, respectively. Figure 6 illustrates
the change in accuracy of Aegis for changing the number of sensors
in different smart home layouts. For all three smart home layouts
(single bedroom, double bedroom, and duplex home), limiting the
number of sensors in the system decreases the accuracy of Aegis.
In conclusion, limiting the number of sensors in a SHS can reduce
the efficiency of Aegis by introducing FN cases in the system.
Evaluation Based on Installed Apps: Smart home users can in-
stall multiple smart apps to configure and control the same devices
or different devices at the same time. For example, users can install
two different apps to control a smart light at a time with motion
and door sensor respectively. To test the effectiveness of Aegis
based on the installed apps, we installed 12 benign apps in total
in the system to build the context-aware model of user activities.
Figure 6d shows the accuracy of Aegis in detecting malicious apps
in a SHS based on installed apps. Here, we installed different mali-
cious apps (Section 3) in the system with multiple benign apps to
determine the effectiveness of Aegis. From 6d, one can notice that
Aegis achieves the highest accuracy of 98.15% for Threat-2 and the
