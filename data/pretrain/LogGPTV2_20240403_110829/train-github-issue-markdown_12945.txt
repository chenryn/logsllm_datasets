This is a fork from #17874 because the use cases for transparent view is a bit
different:
  * When using a FlutterView which intrinsic sizing, the resize operation causes the contents to be re-rendered. This "flash" is quite visible if the background of the view is black. The flash itself is being tracked here: #19189
  * Customer dream wants to show background set in a native container through the flutter view. For instance, you can imagine a text box being laid on top of a "wallpaper". Setting this wallpaper in native container + in Flutter view would lead to hard to control artifacts such as mismatched seams.
  * Certain widgets such as card have implicit margins. This causes a black border to be visible around the card.
