that are divisible into many small sub-circuits like AES or
PRESENT the memory consumption of both implementa-
tions is almost the same; the memory eﬃciency advantage
of our implementation becomes obvious for larger circuits:
Compared to FastGC we achieve a memory consumption re-
duction by factor 5 for Fast Multiplication and by factor 8
for Minimum for approach c) – by combining the repeated
use of a sub-circuit and then just holding the working set in
memory, we can evaluate the Minimum circuit with almost
140 million gates using only 21.5 MB of memory.
