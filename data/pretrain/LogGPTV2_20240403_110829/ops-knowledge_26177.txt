Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of tasks being assigned and completed in stages 20 and 21. The python.PythonRunner component is also recording the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task. Additionally, the broadcast.TorrentBroadcast component is reading a broadcast variable and the storage.MemoryStore component is storing a block in memory.
