User: The load of the Linux server is too high, how to use the top command to analyze the resources occupied by the process and kill unnecessary processes?
Assistant: Use the top command to view information about processes running in the system, including the CPU usage, memory usage, and process ID of the process. The following are the steps to use the top command to analyze the resources occupied by the process and kill unnecessary processes: 1. Open the terminal and enter the top command to view the process information running in the current system: top 2. The top command will be based on the CPU usage Sort from high to low to find the process with the highest CPU usage. If it is a memory problem, you can sort by M usage to find the process with the highest memory usage. 3. View the specific information of the process through the process ID: ps aux | grep process ID 4. According to the viewing result, determine whether to kill the process. If you need to kill, use the kill command to kill the process: kill process ID or use the forced kill command: kill -9 process ID 5. After killing the process, use the top command again to check the system load to ensure that the problem is resolved.
