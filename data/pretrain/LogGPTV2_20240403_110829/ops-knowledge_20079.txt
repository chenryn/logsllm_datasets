User: I have a few python scripts who are opening themselves in cascade by subprocess.Popen().
(I call script1.py who make a popen of script2.py who makes popen of script3.py, etc)
Is there any way to terminate/kill all subprocesses of script1.py from the script1.py PID.
os.killpg() doesn't work.
Thanks for your help.
Assistant: By changing the gid at the beginning of the execution of script2.py, the sub sequent processes belongs to script2 gid. So calling killpg() from script1.py with script2's pid does it well.
