We consider an example model with 𝑀 = 3queues where
queue 1 is a ﬁnite capacity station with MAP service, queues
2 and 3 have exponential service and inﬁnite capacities.
Figure 1(a) illustrates the model with routing probabilities. The
exponential queues have rates 𝜇2 and 𝜇3, the MAP completes
jobs in phase 1 with rate 𝜇1.

(b) State space for 𝑁 = 3 and 𝐹1 = 2 assuming queue 1 in phase 1. State
notation is ((𝑛1, 𝒎, 𝑘1), 𝑛2, 𝑛3), 𝒎 = ∅ is omitted.
Fig. 1. Example network with 2 inﬁnite capacity exponential queues
and a MAP queue with ﬁnite capacity
transitions are omitted, thus this partition is similar to the state
space where the service at the MAP is exponential with rate
𝜇1. We point to [5] for ﬁgures illustrating the effects of phase
changes in the MAP queueing network state space. Figure 1(b)
classiﬁes the activity of queue 3 into “active” (𝑛3 > 0 and
𝑏3 = 0), “idle” (𝑛3 = 0 and 𝑏3 = 0), or “blocked” (𝑛3 > 0
and 𝑏3 = 1). This classiﬁcation is useful to understand the
different rates of departure from queue 3 across the state space.
The states where queue 3 is active are the only states that
contribute to the standard departure transitions out from queue
3. The state ((2, [3], 1), 0, 1) in the blocked subspace denotes
the case where queue 3 is blocked (𝒎 = [3]) since queue 3 has
previously completed a job to be sent to queue 1 while this was
full. As soon as queue 1 completes a job, two simultaneous
transitions take place moving the current state to ((2, 1), 1, 0)
in the idle subspace of queue 3 if the job completed by queue
1 is routed to queue 2. The current state becomes ((2, 1), 0, 1)
in the active subspace of queue 3 if the completed job is
routed to queue 3 which thus restarts immediately service after
unblocking. Such simultaneous transitions are a distinctive
characteristic of the state space due to BAS blocking.
To further appreciate the complexity of bound analysis
for the BAS state space, Figure 2 illustrates a case where
two queues can be blocked. Observe the changes in the
BAS state space level compared to Figure 1. Let us now
assume 𝐹1 = 1, inﬁnite capacities for queues 2 and 3, and
𝑁 = 3 jobs in the network. For simplicity of graphical
representation, the phase 𝑘1 is omitted being always equal
to 1. Figure 2 shows the totally different structure of the state
space. When the system is in the state (1, 1, 1) all queues are
active. If queue 2 completes a job, the current state becomes
((1, [2], 1), 1, 1) where queue 2 is blocked (𝒎 = [2]). If from
this state queue 3 completes a job, the transition leads to state
((1, [2, 3], 1), 1, 1), where both queues 2 and 3 are blocked

(a) State space for 𝑁 = 3 and 𝐹1 = 1 assuming queue 1 in phase
1. State notation is ((𝑛1, 𝒎, 𝑘1), 𝑛2, 𝑛3), 𝒎 = ∅ and all phases
𝑘1 = 1 are omitted.
Fig. 2. Example model 1 when several queues are blocked
(𝒎 = [2, 3]). According to the FBFU unblocking rule, when
queue 1 completes a job, queue 2 is unblocked ﬁrst with a
transition to the state ((1, [3], 1), 1, 1) if the completed job is
routed to queue 2, or to state ((1, [3], 1), 0, 2) if the completed
job is routed to queue 3. This illustrates transitions that do
not exist in non-blocking queueing networks and thus which
require specialized characterization for bounding purposes. To
obtain such a characterization, we develop in Theorem 5 a
new class of balance conditions that is able to describe also
the state space illustrated in Figure 2.
B. Quadratic Reduction (QR) of BAS State Space
Denote with 𝜋(s) the equilibrium probability of state s ∈
𝐸𝐵𝐴𝑆 in the blocking MAP queueing network. We formulate
the quadratic reduction for the BAS case as follows. We
consider the following marginal probability
𝜋(𝑛𝑖, 𝑘𝑖, 𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, 𝒎)
(1)
which is called QR marginal probability and describes the joint
state of queues 𝑖 and 𝑗 in phases 𝑘𝑖 and 𝑘𝑗 while the queues
in 𝒎 are blocked by 𝑓. This formula is immediately obtained
by summing 𝜋(s) over the states with the considered values of
𝑛𝑖, 𝑘𝑖, 𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, and 𝒎. The main advantage of the QR marginal
probability over the original state space representation is that
is scales only quadratically with the total population size,
which is by far the largest parameter of the queueing network
model speciﬁcation. Thus, this provides substantial savings
with respect to a direct state space evaluation by global balance
that involves 𝑂(𝑁 𝑀 ) unknown probabilities.
The goal of the next sections is to develop a characterization
of the balance conditions that relate different values of the QR
marginal probabilities. Previous work has shown that relations
between marginal probabilities can be insufﬁcient for an exact
solution of the queueing network model, but they can be
exploited to determine bounds on performance indexes using
linear programming [5]. We show later in Section IV that this
holds true also for MAP queueing networks both with BAS
and RS-RD blocking.
Common metrics such as utilization, throughput, response
times, and queue-lengths can be immediately computed from
the QR marginal probabilities. For example, the utilization of
queue 𝑖 is
𝑈𝑖 =
∑
∑
(𝑛𝑗 ,𝑘𝑗 ,𝑘𝑖,𝒎)
𝑛𝑖≥1
𝜋(𝑛𝑖, 𝑘𝑖, 𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, 𝒎)
whereas the effective utilization that describes the activity of
a queue excluding its blocking time is
𝐸𝑖 =
𝐸𝑘𝑖
𝑖
𝐾𝑖∑
𝑘𝑖=1
∑
∑
where the effective utilization [3] of phase 𝑘𝑖 is
𝐸𝑘𝑖
𝑖 =
(𝑛𝑗 ,𝑘𝑗 ,𝒎)
𝑛𝑖≥1 𝑖 /∈𝒎
𝜋(𝑛𝑖, 𝑘𝑖, 𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, 𝒎)
Note that 𝐸𝑖 = 𝑈𝑖 if and only if 𝑖 = 𝑓 or 𝑖 cannot be blocked
by 𝑓 due to the network topology. The effective utilization
takes into account the productive utilization of a queue, that is
the period of time the queue is busy and it is not blocked, so it
can produce useful work. Other measures such as mean queue-
lengths, throughput, or response times are similarly deﬁned.
For example, the throughput may be obtained as an effective
utilization divided by the product of mean number of visits
and mean service times [3].
C. Basic Characterization Results
The ﬁrst basic characterization result for QR marginal
probabilities in a BAS setting follows by the equilibrium of
the MAP service processes. During the period where queue 𝑖
is actively serving a job, the MAP service process behaves at
equilibrium in the same way of the same MAP considered in
isolation, since we are assuming that the queue is never idle
nor blocked. This equivalence introduces a balance between
QR marginal probabilities relative to different phases.

Proof: Consider a partitioning of the state space into two
subsets: 𝐺𝑖,𝑘 where queue 𝑖 is in phase 𝑘 and its comple-
mentary set of states ¯𝐺𝑖,𝑘 where queue 𝑖 is in phase ℎ ∕= 𝑘.
By basic properties of Markov processes,
the equilibrium
probability ﬂux exchanged by 𝐺𝑖,𝑘 and ¯𝐺𝑖,𝑘 at equilibrium
must be balanced. However, this is only due to phase changes
that occur in the MAP, with or without an associated departure
from 𝑖. The left hand side represents phase changes moving
the current phase from 𝑘 to any ℎ, whereas the right hand
side is the probability ﬂux due to phase changes that move
the active phase into 𝑘. Note that the condition ℎ ∕= 𝑘 if 𝑗 ∕= 𝑖
ignores phase self-routing of jobs that do not change the active
phase.
Another characterization result follows by observing that the
total population of jobs in each state of the underlying Markov
chain sums to 𝑁. This implies that the sum of the conditional
ﬁrst moment of queue lengths is constant.
