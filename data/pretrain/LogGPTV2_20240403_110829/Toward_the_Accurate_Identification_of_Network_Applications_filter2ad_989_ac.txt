# Traffic Classification and Analysis: Port-Based vs. Content-Based Approaches

## 1. Introduction
Traffic classification is a critical task in network management, and the accuracy of this process can significantly impact network performance and security. This document compares two primary methods of traffic classification: port-based and content-based approaches. The port-based method relies on well-known ports to identify applications, while the content-based method examines the payload of packets to determine the application.

## 2. Observations and Findings
### 2.1 Port-Based Under- and Over-Estimation
Further observation reveals that the BULK traffic (e.g., FTP) is underestimated by approximately 20%, while the WWW traffic shows a difference of 6%. However, the port-based approach not only underestimates traffic but may also overestimate it for certain classes, such as INTERACTIVE applications. This means that traffic flows can be misidentified using the port-based technique. Additionally, applications like peer-to-peer and malware appear to contribute zero traffic in the port-based case due to the lack of standard port identification.

### 2.2 Examining Under and Over-Estimation
#### 2.2.1 BULK Traffic (FTP)
The most significant discrepancy is observed in BULK traffic, which is primarily created by FTP. Port-based classification fails to correctly identify a large class of FTP traffic transported using the PASV mechanism. In contrast, content-based classification can identify the causal relationship between the FTP control flow and data transport, thus accurately attributing the traffic to FTP.

#### 2.2.2 MAIL Traffic
MAIL traffic, consisting of SMTP, IMAP, MAPI, and POP protocols, is estimated with surprising accuracy in both port-based and content-based methods. The number of packets and bytes transferred remains unchanged, and no non-MAIL traffic is found on MAIL ports. This is because MAIL relies on common, Internet-wide standards for port and protocol assignment, making it a reliable traffic source for port-based classification.

#### 2.2.3 Over-Estimation
Port-based classification can also lead to over-estimation. Malware or attack traffic may use well-known ports of a particular service, inflating the attributed traffic. Additionally, if one application uses another as a relay, the traffic attributed to the latter will be inflated. An example is peer-to-peer traffic using HTTP to avoid firewall blocking, which was not present in our dataset.

## 3. Content-Based Analysis
### 3.1 Accuracy and Overheads
Content-based analysis provides higher accuracy but comes with increased computational overhead. Our study involved labor-intensive examination of all data flows, exchanges with system administrators, and users. While this approach is not suitable for real-time feedback, it builds a substantial body of knowledge for future studies. Historical data can assist in decision-making for future analyses.

### 3.2 Complexity and Identification
Table 5 illustrates the relationship between the complexity of analysis and the quantity of positively identified data. Methods are ordered by increasing complexity. Currently, our method employs packet-header analysis and host-profile construction. Signature matching is easier to implement than protocol matching, and single-packet analysis is less complex than analyzing up to the first KByte of a flow. Flow analysis, though complicated, reduces overheads if the number of flows requiring parsing is limited.

### 3.3 Accuracy Gains
Port-based classification correctly identifies approximately 70% of the overall traffic. Applying increasingly complex mechanisms, such as examining up to 1 KByte of a flow, can increase the correctly identified traffic to almost 79%. Mechanism VII further increases this to 98%.

## 4. Summary and Future Work
### 4.1 Summary
Port-based classification can identify a significant amount of traffic but contains errors that can be detected only through content-based techniques. The greatest benefit from content-based techniques often comes from the most complex mechanisms. For sites with a mix of harder-to-detect applications, these inaccuracies may have more adverse consequences.

### 4.2 Future Work
Future research should focus on implementing the content-based system for real-time operation. We need to apply our technique to other Internet locations and different mixes of user traffic. Additionally, we need to address the issue of how much information a traffic classifier needs to access for accurate identification. A technical report describing our manual process is provided in [8].
