## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
https://codesandbox.io/s/7jox7jylj6
  * select a value
  * click it again, to unselect it
  * then the option doesn't lose the selected background until the select menu is closed and reopened
So we can't know if we have unselect it
## Expected Behavior
It should toggle selection on a item after each click
This happens with `multiple` option at least
**edit** : actually the font-weight is slightly changing (400 / 500), but I
believe this background should be cleared is the pointer leaves hover, I guess
there's an `:active` rule that still make it with this background
## Current Behavior
Unselected items stay visually selected
