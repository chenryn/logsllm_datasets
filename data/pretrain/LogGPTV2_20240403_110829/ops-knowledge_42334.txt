User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Here are some running logs
 0 14:41:59 combo Dquot-cache hash table entries: 1024 (order 0, 4096 bytes)
 1 14:41:59 combo sdpd v1.5 started
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: session opened for user <*> by (uid=<*>) 和 ALERT exited abnormally with [1]
B: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*> 和 authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*>  user=root
C: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*> 和 ALERT exited abnormally with [1]
D: Dquot-cache hash table entries: <*> (order <*>, <*> bytes) 和 sdpd v<*>.<*> started
