User: I seem to be in a never ending tail spin of Linux, or not, Windows or not. Web programming or system programming. Python or PHP.
I'am self teaching myself programming. But it seems I keep being torn about which way to go. Unfortunately it is always seemingly good reasons to get side tracked. You know the whole open source or proprietary thing. Lately I have decided after a year that Linux just doesn't cut it for me and it mostly stems from me wanting to watch videos on Channel 9 etc, and the clunkiness that is Linux. So that lead me to, "Should I learn ASP.NET, since I am more so deciding Windows IS a "necessary" evil.
I hope this made sense. The reason I settled in on Web Development as my course to learning programming is because I actually have a task to implement rather then aimlessly reading reference books etc.
Does anyone have any advice at what they may have done to stay focused and not get lead down every tangent or idea.
Assistant: Don't worry so much about the direction you're going, just make sure that:
a) You are enjoying it, and are understanding what you are doing. You don't have to initially understand concepts like polymorphism for example, but you should be understanding the basics of what you are doing. Just can't wrap your mind around Tuples and Dictionaries in Python after awhile? Then it's probably not for you. Of course, that's a very low level example as if you don't get Dictionaries, then there's a problem in general :-)
b) You are working on things that you want to solve, not just because you think you NEED to learn this. You used the phrase "Windows is a necessary evil" No, it isn't. Many companies (big and small) do not use the .NET platform for development. Your approach to Linux was interesting as you could not achieve something you wanted on it and your result was "it's clunky" which seems kind of awkward.
Either way, this isn't about Linux vs. Windows, but I hope that helps. Just go with the flow, and don't worry about what way you're going as long as you're enjoying and learning! :)
