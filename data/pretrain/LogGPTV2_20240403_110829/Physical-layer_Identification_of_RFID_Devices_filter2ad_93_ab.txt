wake-up command. When the commands are no longer
transmitted, an unmodulated period of carrier is then sus-
tained while the oscilloscope records the response from
the transponder. The carrier is turned off between each

tion accuracy [11].
4For 100% ASK modulation we used pulse modulation as standard
built-in amplitude modulation (AM) in our generators could not reach
the required precision.
Figure 1: Signal acquisition setup. Envelope and modulation generators generate wake-up signals that initiate the
response from the RFID transponder. This wake-up signal is transmitted by the transmitting antenna. The acquisition
antenna captures both the wake-up signal and the response from the transponder. The signal from the acquisition
antenna is then captured and recorded by the oscilloscope.

observation to ensure the transponder reboots each time.
Figures 3a and 3b show the collected samples from Type
A and Type B RFID transponders, respectively. This ex-
periment enables us to test if the transponder’s responses
can be distinguished when they are subjected to standard
signals from the reader.
Experiment 2 (Varied Fc): In this experiment, we test
transponder responses to the same signals as in Exper-
iment 1, but on out of (ISO/IEC 14443) speciﬁcation
carrier frequencies. Instead of on Fc=13.56 MHz, our
setup transmits the signals on carrier frequencies be-
tween Fc=12.96 MHz and 14.36 MHz. Figures 3c and
3d display sample transponder responses to signals on
Fc=13.06 MHz. We expect the variation in the transpon-
der responses to be higher when they are subjected to out
of speciﬁcation signals, since the manufacturers mainly
focus on transponder responses within the speciﬁed fre-
quency range.
Experiment 3 (Burst): In this experiment, we tested
transponder responses to bursts of RF energy. We sub-
jected the transponders to 10 cycles (2 µs) of non-
modulated 5 MHz carrier at an amplitude of Vpp=10 V
(the maximum frequency and amplitude supported by
our generators while in burst mode). Figure 4a shows
a sample transponder response to such an RF burst. This
experiment tests the response of transponders to an addi-
tional out-of-speciﬁcation signal. We expect to see vari-
ation in different transponders’ responses for a variety
of reasons. For example since each transponder’s an-
tenna and charge pump is unique, we believe that dur-
ing power-up it will present a unique modulation of an
activating ﬁeld.
Experiment 4 (Frequency Sweep): This experiment
consists of observing transponder responses to a non-
modulated carrier linear sweep from 100 Hz to 15 MHz
at an amplitude of Vpp=10 V (as measured at transmit-
ting antenna). The duration of the sweep is ﬁxed to the
maximum allowed by our generator, 10 ms. In this test
we examine how the transponders react to many differ-
ent frequencies. Among other things, such an experiment
provides information about the resonances of the RF cir-
cuitry in each transponder. Figure 4b shows a sample
transponder response to a frequency sweep. Note the dif-
ferent shape artifacts.
We found that samples collected from Experiment 2
were well suited for transponder classiﬁcation, whereas

suited for identiﬁcation of individual RFID transponders.
We discuss this result at greater length in Section 4.
3.3 Collected Data
Using the proposed setup, we performed the experiments
described in Section 3.2 and collected samples from
8 passports and 50 JCOP NXP 4.1 smart cards (same
model and manufacturer). The types of devices used in
the experiments are shown in Table 1. For the privacy of
our research subjects we arbitrarily labeled the passports
as ID1 to 8. To further protect their privacy we give the
country and place of issuance under the pseudonyms C1
to C3 and P1 to P6 respectively.
Our data collection procedure for a single experi-
ment ”run” was as follows: We positioned the target
RFID device on the experimental platform with all other
transponders being at an out-of-range distance from the
activating ﬁeld. We then placed a heavy non-metallic
weight on top of the transponder to position it ﬁrmly
and horizontally on the platform. For each device we
then performed Experiments 1-4 at ﬁxed acquisition tim-
ing offset and sampling rate and saved the samples to
a disk for later analysis. For each transponder we per-
formed two runs, completely removing and replacing
the target transponder on the experimental platform be-
tween runs. This ensures that extracted features are sta-
ble across repositioning.
In each iteration of Experiment 2 we collected 4 sam-
ples per run for 14 different carrier frequencies starting
from Fc=12.96 up to 14.36 MHz with a step of 100 KHz.
This resulted in 64 samples per transponder per run. In
Experiments 3 and 4 we collected 50 samples per device
per run.

4 Feature Extraction and Selection
The goal of the feature extraction and selection is to ob-
tain distinctive ﬁngerprints from raw data samples col-
lected in the proposed experiments, which most effec-
tively support the two objectives in our work, namely
classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation. In this section, we de-
tail the extraction and matching procedures of two types
of features effective for that purpose: modulation-shape
features (Section 4.1) and spectral PCA features (Sec-
tion 4.2). We also investigated the use of some tim-
ing features, such as the time interval within which the
transponder responds to an WUQ command and the du-
ration of that response (Figure 5a). These timing features
performed poorly in both tasks, hence in this work we fo-
cus on the modulation-shape and spectral features.
4.1 Modulation-shape Features
In this section, we describe the extraction and match-
ing procedures for the features extracted from the shape
of the modulated signal of the transponder responses at
a given carrier frequency Fc (Experiment 1&2). Fig-
ure 5 b) shows the shape of the On-Off keying modu-
lation for the JCOP NXP 4.1 card for the ﬁrst packet in a
transponder’s response to a wake-up command. All Type
A transponders in our study had a logically identical ﬁrst
packet.
For a given transponder, the features of the modulated
signal are extracted from the captured transponder re-
sponse (see Figure 3) denoted as f(t, l), using Hilbert
transformation. Here, f(t, l) is the amplitude of the sig-
nal l at time t. The Hilbert transformation is a com-
mon transformation in signal processing used to obtain
the signal envelope [38].
In Step (i), we apply Hilbert transformation on f(t, l)
to obtain H(t, l):
H(t, l) = Hil(f(t, l))
(1)
where Hil is a function implementing the Hilbert trans-
form [36].
6
In Step (ii), the starting point of the modulation in
H(t, l) is determined using the variance-based threshold
detection algorithm described in [40]. The end point is
ﬁxed to a pre-deﬁned value (see Section 5) and then the
modulation-shape ﬁngerprint is extracted.
Feature matching between a reference and a test ﬁn-
gerprints is performed using standardized Euclidean dis-
tance, where each coordinate in the sum of squares is
inverse weighted by the sample variance of that coordi-
nate [35].
4.2 Spectral Features
In this section, we describe the extraction and match-
ing of spectral features from data collected from Experi-
ments 3 (Burst) and 4 (Sweep) (Section 3.2).
Both frequency sweep and burst data samples are ex-
tremely high-dimensional: each sweep data sample con-
tains 960000 points (dimensions) and each burst data
sample contains 40000. Such high-dimensional data typ-
ically contain many noisy dimensions which are detri-
mental to ﬁnding distinctive features. Therefore, it is
critical to remove the noise as much as possible from the
raw data samples.
We explored two basic approaches to solve the dimen-
sionality problem. In the ﬁrst approach, we considered
transforming the data in the frequency domain by means
of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and remove the high
frequencies (usually considered noisy) by ﬁltering. How-
ever, matching experiments using direct vector similarity
measures such as Euclidean and Cosine distance failed
to produce distinctive enough features. This may be be-
cause in removing the high frequencies we are also re-
moving frequencies that contain discriminative capabil-
ities. Such behavior is commonly noticed in biometrics
research [10]. In the second approach we down-sampled
the signal at different rates in order to reduce the dimen-
sionality. We then transformed the data in the frequency
domain by FFT and applied standard vector similarity
measures. Again reducing the dimensionality in this way
did not prove to be effective in extracting sufﬁciently dis-

criminative features.
To overcome the above problems, we use a modiﬁ-
cation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for high-
dimensional data [7], that reduces data dimensionality by
discarding dimensions that do not contribute to the total
covariance. Given that the number of dimensions is very
high, orders of magnitude higher than the number of data
samples we can process, a standard PCA procedure can-
not be applied. In the following subsection, we brieﬂy
describe the used PCA modiﬁcation.
4.2.1 Feature Extraction and Matching
For a given RFID device, spectral PCA features are ex-
tracted from N captured samples using a linear transfor-
mation derived from PCA for high-dimensional data. We
denote a signal by f(t, l), where f(t, l) is the amplitude
of the signal l at time t. The features are extracted in the
following three steps:
In Step (i), we apply a one-dimensional Fourier transfor-
mation on f(t, l) to obtain F (ω, l):
M−1(cid:88)
m=0
F (ω, l) =
1√
M
f(t, l) exp(−2πi
tω
M
)
(2)
where M is the length of signal considered and 0 ≤ t ≤
M − 1 is time. We then remove from F (ω, l) its DC
component and the redundant part of the spectrum; we
denote the remaining part of the spectrum by (cid:126)sl.
In Step (ii), a projected vector (cid:126)gl, also called a spectral
feature, is extracted from the Fourier spectrum using a
PCA matrix WP CA:
P CA (cid:126)sl
(cid:126)gl = W t
(3)
The feature extraction from N captured samples for a
given transponder is then given by G = W t
P CAS where
G is an array of (cid:126)gl and S is a matrix S = [ (cid:126)s0 .. (cid:126)sl .. (cid:126)sN ].
Finally, in Step (iii), the feature template (ﬁngerprint) h
used for matching is computed:
h = { ˆG; ΣG}
(4)
where ˆG denotes the mean vector of G and ΣG denotes
the covariance matrix of G. The number of captured
samples N used to build the feature template and the
number of projected vectors in WP CA (i.e., the subspace
dimension) are experimentally determined.
Mahalanobis distance is used to ﬁnd the similarities
between ﬁngerprints5. The result of matching a reference
hR and a test hT feature templates is a matching score,
