User:  Please provide a high-availability architecture design to ensure that the system can automatically switch to the backup node when a failure occurs
Assistant: high-availability architecture design scheme can adopt a master-slave replication architecture, in which the master node is responsible for receiving and processing various requests, while the slave node continuously synchronizes data from the master node and keeps the data up-to-date. If the master node fails, the slave node can be automatically promoted to the master node and ensure smooth service. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Establish a high-speed data synchronization channel between the master node and the slave node to ensure real-time data synchronization between the two nodes. 2. Use a load balancer to distribute requests to master and slave nodes, and monitor the health of each node in the system. 3. Set up heartbeat monitoring between the master node and the slave node to ensure the normal operation of the master node, and automatically trigger the upgrade operation of the slave node after the master node fails. During the node upgrade process, the data of the master node is retained to ensure data reliability. 4. Using the automatic switching mechanism, the main node circuit is routed to the backup node, and after the backup node is started, the application is automatically forced to become available and start working. 5. After the fault is repaired, the master node will become the master node again and keep all the data processed by itself. If the previous backup node has new data, it needs to be synchronized back to the primary node to ensure data consistency. The above is a high-availability architecture design scheme, which can ensure that the system can automatically switch to the backup node when a failure occurs, while ensuring data integrity and continuity.
