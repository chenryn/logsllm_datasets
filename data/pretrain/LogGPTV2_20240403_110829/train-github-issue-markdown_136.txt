    Hello,
    I've been using scipy for a while and found out the following, which seems to me like a true bug.
    Converting coo_matrix to dok_matrix doesn't  take into account coinsiding i and j cases:
    >>> cols = (0, 1, 2, 1)
    >>> rows = (0, 1, 2, 1)
    >>> vals = (1, 1, 1, 1)
    >>> B = sparse.coo_matrix((vals, (rows, cols)))
    >>> print B.todense()
    [[1 0 0]
     [0 2 0]
     [0 0 1]]
    >>> print B.todok().todense()
    [[1 0 0]
     [0 1 0]
     [0 0 1]]
    >>> sp.__version__
    Out[17]: '0.14.0'
    I've spent a lot of time figuring this out, therefor I decided to report it.
