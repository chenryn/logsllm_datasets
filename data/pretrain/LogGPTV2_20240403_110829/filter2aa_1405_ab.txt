### Aurora
- **"Aurora" was about intercept.**

### GoogleSharing
- **The scope of the “Google choice” has become quite large.**
- **We need innovation that allows us to reject this type of false choice while still maintaining anonymity.**
- **We need fast and reliable anonymous access to Google services.**

### GoogleSharing Proxy
- **GoogleSharing + Proxy Server**

```
[User] -> [Proxy] -> [Google] -> [Internet]

### Second Thesis
- **Crypto War → Data Freedom**
- **Future of Data Control**
- **Projects Born Out of Reality: Darknets, Data Havens, Hidden Services**
- **Not the Future We Got**
- **Privacy Advocates Love “the Other.”**
- **Iran Launches National Email Service**

### Loss on Crypto
- **Giving Up → Changing Strategies**
- **Key Escrow → Key Disclosure**
- **Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA)**
- **Key Disclosure**
- **No Forward Security**

### Tasks for the Future
1. **Deal with the choices that aren't choices.**
2. **Worry a little less about information freedom.**
3. **Worry a lot more about forward security.**

### Off-the-Record Communication

### PGP Model
- **Bob's Public Key is used to encrypt each email.**
  - **Email 1**
  - **Email 2**
  - **Email 3**

#### Issues with PGP Model
- **One key compromise affects all previous correspondence.**
- **The secrecy of what I write is a function of your security practices.**
- **There is authenticity, but no deniability.**

### Example PGP Message
```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Hey Bob, today I was thinking that Eve is a real jerk.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
iEYEARECAAYFAkumY0MACgkQ2yS3tG03iIJhAACgiufmacfyU
M/9PYcVS2Mdb9tdmhYAoO4P0pZug2D7BuFEPkLovKpipore=8
rKh
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
```

### OTR Model
- **Key Exchange Part 1 (Signed with Alice's Private Key)**
- **Key Exchange Part 2 (Signed with Bob's Private Key)**

#### OTR Message Flow
- **Message 1 || Key Exchange Part 1 (Current Key)**
- **Message 2 || Key Exchange Part 2 (Current Key)**
- **Message 3 || Key Exchange Part 1 (Current Key + 1)**
- **Message 4 || Key Exchange Part 2 (Current Key + 1)**

#### OTR Features
- **Messages are encrypted with a session key.**
- **Authenticated with MAC.**
- **Signatures are undeniable because they have only one possible author.**
- **MACs have two possible authors.**
- **After a broadcast, anyone can forge an old message.**

#### Benefits of OTR
- **A key compromise does not affect previous messages.**
- **You get authenticity, but also deniability.**

### Future
- **Whisper Systems: Bring forward-secure protocols into mobile phones.**

#### Mobile VoIP
- **But doesn't mobile VoIP suck?**
  - **Asterisk Signaling (SMS)**
  - **RTP**
  - **ZRTP**

#### Advantages of Whisper Systems
- **Your phone doesn't need to maintain a constant network connection to a SIP server.**
- **(Your phone can go to sleep!)**
- **You don't need the equivalent of a Skype ID.**
- **(Addressing is based on existing phone numbers!)**
- **You don't need to run a VoIP server.**
- **(Just install the app and you're ready!)**

#### ZRTP
- **Negotiate ephemeral session key.**
- **Derive “Short Authentication String.”**
