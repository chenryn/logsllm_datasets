User: Please list the commonly used Linux system monitoring tools, and introduce their main functions and usage methods.
Assistant: 1. top: top is one of the most commonly used monitoring tools on Linux systems. It provides a quick overview of system status by displaying real-time information about system processes. Use the top command to view the CPU, memory, and I/O resource usage of system processes. How to use: Enter top in the terminal to run. 2. vmstat: vmstat is an advanced Linux system monitoring tool that can provide rich system running status indicators, such as memory usage, virtual memory, CPU usage, I/O statistics, etc. In a system with high concurrency, you can view the load status of the system through vmstat. How to use: Enter vmstat in the terminal to run it. 3. sar: sar is a powerful performance analysis tool that can collect and report the status and performance data of various system resources, including CPU, disk and network information. sar provides multiple collection frequencies and data reports in various formats. How to use: Enter sar in the terminal to run. 4. iostat: iostat is a tool for monitoring disks. It can display disk read and write speeds and disk usage, which can help identify disk operation performance problems. How to use: Enter iostat in the terminal to run it. 5. netstat: netstat is used to monitor network usage. It can display all network interfaces, IP protocols, and TCP/UDP ports connected to the system, and can also view the status and transmission information of network connections. How to use: Enter netstat in the terminal to run it. 6. iftop: iftop is a real-time traffic monitoring tool that supports multiple network cards and filtering functions, and can display traffic statistics in the terminal. iftop can quickly detect bottlenecks in the network, helping to quickly diagnose network problems. How to use: Enter iftop in the terminal to run. 7. htop: htop is an advanced process manager based on the top command. It uses a graphical interface to display the usage of processes and system resources, and can view and manage processes in the system more conveniently and intuitively. How to use: Enter htop in the terminal to run. In short, the Linux system monitoring tools listed above are commonly used tools, and they are relatively simple and convenient to use, which can help administrators find problems in time and solve them quickly.
