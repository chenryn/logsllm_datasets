## Abstract

This paper presents the first large-scale study of correlated attacks, which are defined as attacks mounted by the same source IP against different networks. Using a dataset from 1700 intrusion detection systems (IDSs), we demonstrate that correlated attacks are prevalent in the current Internet. Specifically, 20% of all offending sources mount correlated attacks, accounting for more than 40% of all IDS alerts in our logs. We also uncover important characteristics of these attacks. Correlated attacks often appear at different networks within a few minutes of each other, highlighting the difficulty of mitigating these attacks through occasional offline exchange of lists of malicious IP addresses. Furthermore, correlated attacks are highly targeted. The 1700 IDSs can be divided into small, stable groups of 4-6 members; IDSs within the same group experience a large number of correlated attacks, while IDSs in different groups see almost no correlated attacks. Our findings have significant implications for collaborative intrusion detection, suggesting that IDSs need to exchange alert information in real-time. Additionally, exchanging alerts among the fixed IDSs in the same correlation group achieves nearly the same benefits as collaborating with all IDSs, while significantly reducing overhead.

## 1. Introduction

In this paper, we study correlated attacks, defined as attacks mounted by the same source IP against different networks. Currently, approximately 30,000 new machines are compromised daily and used to launch attacks on various parts of the Internet. In many cases, the same machines are involved in multiple attacks against different networks, i.e., correlated attacks.

Correlated attacks are not only an important Internet phenomenon but also crucial for collaborative intrusion detection. An IDS at one network can exchange information about recent alerts and offending IPs with other IDSs, allowing future packets from suspicious sources to be flagged for dropping or further scrutiny. Such collaboration is most effective when it occurs between networks experiencing correlated attacks.

We present the first large-scale empirical investigation of attack correlation in the Internet. We analyze logs from 1700 IDSs and firewalls deployed in the US and Europe. Our data is rich, including sanitized logs from DSHIELD and multiple universities, as well as detailed attack logs from 40 IDSs maintained by a Tier-1 provider to protect its customer networks. The logs cover 1-3 months and a significant portion of the IP address space. Unlike prior work, which has focused on the design of collaborative intrusion detection systems, we address the following two questions:

- **Prevalence of Attack Correlation:** How prevalent are correlated attacks in the current Internet? Although collaboration to detect common attackers seems plausible, there is no quantification of the potential benefits. Measuring the frequency with which different networks become victims of a common attacker, the types of shared attacks, and the resulting IDS alerts is essential to determine if collaboration is worth the effort.
- **Selection of Trusted and Effective Collaborators:** How can an IDS pick trusted and effective collaborators? Allowing IDSs to exchange alerts to collaborate against common attackers requires addressing two issues: overhead and trust. Exchanging alert data with thousands of IDSs in real-time is resource-intensive. Therefore, an IDS needs to intelligently select its collaborators to minimize overhead and maximize the utility of the collaboration. Additionally, two networks must establish trust before they can exchange IDS data, ensuring that the information received is not maliciously manipulated and that internal vulnerabilities are not leaked to malicious entities.

Our study results in four major findings:

(a) **Extent of Attack Correlation:** Correlated attacks are prevalent in the Internet; 20% of the offending IP sources attack multiple networks, and these common attackers are responsible for 40% of the total alerts in our dataset. Shared attackers target different networks within a few minutes of each other, emphasizing the advantage of real-time IDS collaboration over sharing attack logs offline.

(b) **Reducing Collaboration Overhead by Exploiting Correlation Structure:** We analyze the spatial structure of attack correlation and discover that the 1700 IDSs can be divided into small, stable groups of 4-6 members. IDSs within the same group experience highly correlated attacks, whereas IDSs in different groups see uncorrelated attacks. Collaborating with only IDSs in the same correlation group achieves the same utility as collaborating with all IDSs, while dramatically reducing the collaboration overhead.

The small correlation groups seem to arise from recent attack trends. For example, victim sites in the same group may be on a single hit list or natural targets of a particular exploit, such as the Santy worm, which attacked popular phpBB discussion forums. Each group appears to be characterized by a specific attack type, e.g., SMTP, NT, or IIS groups, indicating that targeted attacks create small correlation groups of sites running particular software/services.

(c) **Scalable Trust Establishment:** Our measurements reveal that correlation groups are fairly stable and their membership persists for the duration of the dataset (1-3 months). Thus, each network needs to collaborate with only 4-6 fixed networks in its group. The small number of IDSs in a group and their persistent membership allow a network to check their credibility offline and establish trust using out-of-band mechanisms such as legal contracts or reputation. A network still needs to learn who is in its correlation group. This service can be provided by trusted non-profit organizations like CERT and DSHIELD, or commercial entities. They receive sanitized alert data, analyze it for attack correlation, and inform the participating networks about others in their correlation group. The process is scalable because correlation groups are persistent for long intervals (months) and do not need frequent updates.

(d) **Importance of Picking the Right Collaborators:** We provide rough estimates of the overhead and detection capability obtained via different choices of collaborating IDSs. We focus on collaboration to quickly blacklist malicious IP sources. Using a trace-driven simulation, we compare the following schemes: (1) correlation-based collaboration (CBC), where each IDS collaborates with only IDSs in its correlation group; (2) random collaborators, where an IDS collaborates with the same number of IDSs in its correlation group but picks the identity of its collaborators randomly; (3) local detection with no collaboration; (4) collaboration with all IDSs in the dataset. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of picking the right collaborators. Mainly:
  - CBC has almost as good detection capability as collaborating with all IDSs, but generates less than 0.3% of the traffic overhead. It detects 95% of the attackers detected by collaborating with all IDSs and reduces alert volumes by nearly the same amount.
  - Compared to local detection, CBC increases the number of detected common attackers at an IDS by 30% and speeds up blacklisting for about 75% of the common attackers. As a result of the blacklisting, correlation-based collaboration reduces the size of the log that the administrator has to examine by an additional 38%.
  - Replacing the IDSs in the correlation group with random collaborators reduces the detection capabilities dramatically and does not add much beyond local detection.

## 2. Dataset and Method

### 2.1 Dataset

Our dataset is both large and rich, consisting of logs collected from 1700 different IDSs deployed in the US and Europe. The logs can be divided into three distinct sets based on their origin: (1) 40 IDSs on different networks in a Tier-1 ISP; (2) DSHIELD logs; (3) University logs. The logs cover periods of 1-3 months and span a relatively large fraction of the IP address space, including a /8 ISP space and many /16 and /24 networks.

#### (a) ISP Logs
We have logs from 40 IDSs deployed in a large ISP with a /8 address space. These IDS boxes protect different customer networks and span a large geographic area but are administered by the ISP, ensuring identical characteristics and signature sets. The signature set is large and diverse, consisting of over 500 different alerts. The logs contain full unanonymized packet headers for all suspicious packets, as shown in Figure 1a. The logs cover two separate periods: July 1 to August 30, 2004, and December 15, 2004, to January 15, 2005. The data exhibits a large amount of variation in the kind of attacks seen (over 100 different attack types) and the distribution of attacking IP addresses (over 100,000 unique source addresses), with 40,000 alerts per day per IDS.

#### (b) DSHIELD Logs
DSHIELD is a global repository set up as a research initiative by the SANS Institute. Participating organizations provide IDS/firewall logs, which DSHIELD uses for detecting and analyzing new vulnerabilities and generating blacklists. Since the IDS systems participating in DSHIELD employ widely varying software, DSHIELD uses a minimal record format for its logs and scrubs the high-order 8 bits of the destination IP address, as shown in Figure 1b. The entities participating in DSHIELD vary in size from several Class B networks to smaller Class C networks and are distributed globally. The logs are substantial, with nearly 15,000 alerts per day per IDS. We have collected DSHIELD logs from 1657 IDSs for the period from December 15, 2004, to January 15, 2005, corresponding to the ISP dataset.

#### (c) University Logs
Finally, we collect a set of logs from IDS/firewall systems deployed at three universities: U1, U2, and U3. For U1, we have access to raw data complete with packet headers and the nature of the offense detected. The second university, U2, provided us with logs from running the Bro IDS, but with protected addresses anonymized. The signature set deployed is different, and the alerts consist mostly of scans of IP addresses and port scans. The third university, U3, provided us with firewall logs consisting of blocked connection attempts. The University logs generate 30,000 alerts per day per IDS on average.
