User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Send Ctrl-Alt-Del over SSH? I know that Linux may, depending on configuration, allow the interactive user to reboot the server by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del even without logging in. I have a remote console session over SSH to a remote server that I cannot log into, but I want to reboot it. Is it possible to somehow send the key combination Control-Alt-Delete over SSH (or telnet)? If so, how?

Edit: to clarify, I am not just connected to the server's sshd over ssh - I am connected via a KVM over IP switch, so it's a serial console. But this connection itself is over SSH and my question is how to send the Ctrl-Alt-Del key combination over it.

Assistant: You can use the Sysrq trigger in order to make an immediate reset (it's like pressing ALT-BREAK-b):

echo b &gt;/proc/sysrq-trigger

BEFORE that, you might want to sync all filesystems, to not lose any data:

echo s &gt;/proc/sysrq-trigger

This might only work if CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ is enabled in your kernel. The possible keys are explained at Wikipedia btw.
