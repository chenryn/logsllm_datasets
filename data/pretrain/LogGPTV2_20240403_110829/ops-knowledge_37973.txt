User: How to configure Nginx server and reverse proxy in Linux?
Assistant: Here are the steps to configure the Nginx server and reverse proxy in Linux: 1. Install Nginx Install Nginx using the following command: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx 2. Start Nginx Start Nginx using the following command: sudo systemctl start nginx If you want to start Nginx automatically after booting, you can run the following command: sudo systemctl enable nginx 3. Configure Nginx The configuration file of Nginx is located in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. You can use the following command to open this file for editing: sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf Configure related configurations in the configuration file, such as listening port, reverse proxy, etc. Here is a simple reverse proxy configuration example: http { upstream backend { server backend_server; } server { listen 80; server_name frontend_server; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $ remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } } In the above example, Nginx listens on port 80 and reverse proxy requests to the backend_server. At the same time, set the Host, X-Real-IP, and X-Forwarded-For information in the request header as relevant information of the current request. 4. Reload the Nginx configuration After modifying the Nginx configuration file, you need to reload the configuration to take effect. Use the following command to reload the Nginx configuration: sudo systemctl reload nginx At this point, the reverse proxy configuration of Nginx is complete.
