Applications Manager (Version 15.4), which is an on-premises offering, and Site24x7 for SaaS deployments. ManageEngine is a subsidiary of Zoho Corp. Although the two share common code, they do not have feature parity. There are many other products in the ManageEngine portfolio, including service desk, endpoint management and identity management tools.ManageEngine scored below the mean for all critical capabilities. It scored highest for business analysis and IT service monitoring. Although ManageEngine scored lowest on RASP, because it does not have an integrated security offering, there are stand-alone security information and event management (SIEM) and security auditing tools in the wider portfolio.Both products are best suited to small or midsize businesses (SMBs). Based on Gartner’s analysis, the product is best aligned with the IT operations use case.
Microsoft

This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
Microsoft scored at or above the mean on all critical capabilities. Its strongestdemonstrated capabilities were for business analysis and behavior analysis. Microsoft Azure Monitor is tightly integrated into the provider’s development and operations tools, and possesses good capabilities for application debugging and distributed profiling. The strong functionality and application maps are somewhat offset by workflows that require high knowledge of the product and environment being analyzed.Microsoft’s APM and observability product provides tight integration with the vendor’s ecosystem, such as Azure DevOps and GitHub, but also extends bidirectional integration with many other popular DevOps tools. Microsoft Azure Monitor lags behind in monitoring performance at endpoints and isolation of performance problems caused by network traffic, which required a separate product.Microsoft’s APM and observability offering is best suited for the application owner/line of business and DevOps/AppDev use cases.
New Relic
New Relic’s APM product evaluated in this research is part of the New Relic One platform. The platform is offered exclusively as a SaaS deployment. It can ingest telemetry from multiple environments into its data platform.New Relic scored above or on the mean for most critical capabilities. Its highest scores were in behavior analysis and application debugging and distributed profiling. It also scored well in IT service monitoring. Its lowest scores were in RASP (where it has yet to bring a security offering to market) and in business analysis.New Relic products have a particular focus on developers and SREs. The vendor recently expanded its portfolio to include Codestream, a plug-in that enables developers to use their integrated development environments (IDEs) to debug production code. New Relic is also adding new telemetry types to the platform, such as extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF) and enhanced support for OpenTelemetry.New Relic One is best suited for the SRE/platform operations and DevOps/AppDev use cases.

VMware’s APM and observability product Tanzu Observability (TO) by Wavefront was evaluated in this research. Tanzu Observability includes more observability than APM features and has been used by enterprises, startups and service providers as a time-series-based monitoring platform. Wavefront includes support for OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, which is how the product supports APM use cases.VMware scored below the mean on all critical capabilities, with its strongest performance in application debugging and distributed profiling. TO’s lowest score was in business analysis, because the product does not have native support for monitoring application user journeys. The lack of an integrated security option results in TO being marked “N/A”for that use case.VMware is best suited for the DevOps/AppDev and SRE/platform operations use cases.
Context
Given the increased adoption of hybrid and multicloud technologies to support digital transformation initiatives, APM and observability software solutions have become critical to the success of a growing set of stakeholders in IT, software development and the business. These solutions help organizations improve UX, shorten mean time to repair (MTTR), improve service availability, detect anomalous application behavior and forecast future problems. They also provide critical data that is useful outside a purely IToperations context, including insight into the impact that performance has on customer behavior and business processes.

APM and observability software is part of an overall enterprise availability and performance monitoring portfolio, and its adoption becomes more important due to a confluence of factors, including:■	The growing trend and need for digital transformation driving the importance of the 	health of the application, which directly corresponds to the health of the business
■	Increasing application architecture and deployment complexity; on-premises, hybrid, 	cloud-native and multicloud deployments; and an uptake in the adoption of 	containers, Kubernetes, microservices and serverless computing■	The increasing velocity of application releases, configuration changes and 	integrations
■	The large and varied number of potential endpoints from which the consumption of 	enterprise business services occurs
Product/Service Class DefinitionAPM and observability software solutions provide for the collection, aggregation and analysis of data to assess application performance. These tools are increasingly being tasked to solve difficult issues in diverse and complex application architectures — on-premises, in the cloud and hybrid — using the APM critical capabilities identified in the Critical Capabilities Definition section of this research.Critical Capabilities Definition
Business Analysis
Business analysis identifies the health of the organization with respect to its KPIs, including financial metrics. Business processes describe and, using APM, track its flow and status across the underlying infrastructure.Business analysis goes beyond performance and availability statistics. It provides insight into LOBs, including for digital marketers and application developers, on the efficacy of the services being offered. Shopping cart abandonment rates, shopping cart conversions and even the financial value of a transaction are some of the measures to look for in this area.

Root Cause Analysis
Root cause analysis attempts to determine the probable cause of a problem, then construct a causality chain that links cause and effect. Much of the activity of APM technology focuses on detecting and providing insight into root causes.The probable cause (for example, a failure or degradation) is linked on a graph to the entities (e.g., application, services or infrastructure) that are affected or will be affected. This methodology supports differentiation between cause and effect, and prioritizes repair on the cause, rather than attempting to fix transient symptoms.
ITService/Infrastructure MonitoringITService/Infrastructure Monitoring
This reflects whether agreed-on commitments regarding responsiveness and uptime are being met. This includes identifying adherence to contracted service-level availability and performance thresholds.Often spelled out in the form of service-level agreements (SLAs), operational-level agreements (OLAs) and SLOs, these measures provide visibility to line-of-business and application owners, as well as to IT operations and DevOps teams, on the health of key services. The metrics provide a common view or boundary object that enables 
communication across these disparate teams.The inclusion of infrastructure monitoring here reflects the sensitivity that many 
organizations have regarding monitoring costs and agent sprawl. Because APM and observability solutions often presume compute instances or VM-level agents for collecting telemetry from applications, collecting and analyzing, infrastructure-level telemetry is increasingly an expectation.
ADDPADDP
Application debugging and distributed profiling is the process of identifying the sources of defects and errors in computer and program code and mitigating performance 
degradation.
Application debugging is a primary activity of application developers and, sometimes, application support teams, in the process of finding the causes of undesirable program effects. Distributed profiling focuses on identifying and localizing the sources of performance degradation across an infrastructure made up of applications, services and machines.Gartner, Inc. | G00750993 Page 21 of 31

RASP
Runtime application self protection is a type of application shielding, located on a workload or client endpoint, that can identify vulnerable components at runtime and, in some cases, block attempts to exploit them.The RASP features of APM and observability solutions offer an additional layer in a defense-in-depth strategy, rather than removing the need for other security solutions. This critical capability was introduced this year, so it is not unexpected that most vendors’lowest scores were in this area.
Behavior AnalysisBehavior Analysis
Behavior analysis facilitates the discovery and classification of user and application behavior by providing guided or ad hoc access to raw telemetry in a manner that supports iterative, hypothesis-driven and exploratory analysis.
This capability highlights the maturity of the observability component in APM and observability solutions.
Use Cases
IT OperationsUse Cases
IT Operations
IT operations teams are usually tasked with keeping the infrastructure operating efficiently. However, its areas of responsibility can vary widely.IT operations practitioners may be in specific silos, such as the network team, server team, virtualization team, application support team or other cross-functional teams (such as a generalized monitoring team). Most use of APM and observability tools in traditional IT operations teams involves generalists tasked with identifying problems quickly. This is accomplished by using service monitoring and anomaly detection for early-warning notifications of performance issues.Security Operations
Security operations is tasked with maximizing organizational resilience against business risks, threats and exposure, and enabling prevention, detection and response.
Security operations is also responsible for the security operations center (SOC), which is the command, control and response element for security-related events and incidents. Security operations is a new use case for APM and observability in this edition of the Critical Capabilities.Gartner, Inc. | G00750993 Page 22 of 31
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
Application vulnerabilities are responsible for many of the high-profile breaches and intrusions that receive news coverage and are damaging to the reputation and health of the affected organizations. The trace telemetry that APM and observability solutions collect to monitor performance includes valuable security signals as well. Although today’s implementations are quite nascent, the security capabilities of APM andobservability tools have proved to be valuable. The Log4Shell incident in late 2021, in which a long-standing, but recently discovered, vulnerability was being widely and actively exploited, was an outstanding proving ground.
Digital Experience Monitoring
This is associated with multiple roles in organizations that use APM and observability tools to understand application performance and usability characteristics.DEM technologies monitor availability, performance and experience quality as end users interact with applications and supporting infrastructure. Users can be external consumers of a service (such as patrons of a retail website), internal employees accessing corporate tools (such as a benefits management system) or a combination of both. DEMtechnologies look to observe and model the behavior of users as a continuous flow of interactions in the form of user journeys.
DevOps/AppDev
DevOps release teams must rapidly assess the quality (and effectiveness) of recent releases to detect and diagnose issues quickly.This often requires in-depth data sourced from multiple, integrated tools. DevOps teams also help plan for future requirements and, therefore, look to assess the impact of recently performed or planned application or infrastructure changes. Application developers increasingly make APM buying decisions, due to changes in how IT teams support the deployment of emerging technologies with cloud-native architectures, as well asincreasing the separation of responsibilities between core IT functions and developers.
Ultimately, the role responsible for developing and supporting software visibility and instrumentation is a key element. This role also includes some elements of application testing through the application life cycle. A key buying criterion of application developers is method-level code visibility, including the ability to compare and profile code in production environments. Problem isolation is another key capability that is often shared with application support. Infrastructure visibility provides increased understanding of the impact the code has on infrastructure elements.Gartner, Inc. | G00750993 Page 23 of 31

DevOps and App/Dev use cases generally have the same APM and observability requirements, although they are often distinct functions in an organization.
Application Owner/Line of Business
Application owners, LOB managers and those responsible for service delivery from a nontechnical perspective are becoming interested in APM technologies.These users formerly had been provided limited infrastructure metrics and health data from IT operations organizations. However, because this information was not enough to make business decisions, LOB buyers are driving APM suite tool purchases. The primary focus of these users is on business metrics and customer journeys, but end-user experience data is also important to detect trends before they manifest into something that might harm the business.SRE/Platform Operations
This provides a self-service development, deployment and operational platform that enables multiple software delivery teams to build and operate their own products.
SRE enables cross-functional teams to design and operate scalable, resilient systems with complex modern architectures, usually in cloud environments.As development of cloud-native applications continues to increase, APM and observability vendors have continued to evolve their support for applications built, using microservices, packaged in containers and deployed across flexible, intelligent infrastructures. Typically, the containers are orchestrated using Kubernetes. As such, the line between theapplication and the intelligent infrastructure becomes blurred. This is especially true as cloud-native applications are isolated or abstracted from server, OS and even traditional network dependencies. These architectures are of enormous value to the business in terms of cost and agility, and they present new challenges to monitoring tools, such as the short lifetime of containers, which is often only seconds.Most often, platform operations or SRE are the personas managing cloud-native 
applications and responsible for their performance and availability. Their skills are a combination of DevOps and traditional ITOps skills, and they work with cloud 
management, infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring and observability tools, such as those from these vendors.
