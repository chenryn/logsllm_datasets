Question: "In an Android system, a developer needs to change a system process to interact with a new, non-AOSP vendor component. Why is it not possible to extend attributes in `system/sepolicy/public` to accommodate this change, and where must the policy dictating this interaction be placed?"
 "A": "Attributes can be extended in `system/sepolicy/public` to label new objects in `/vendor`, and the policy should be placed in `system/sepolicy/public`."
 "B": "Attributes can be extended in `system/sepolicy/public` for future compatibility, but the policy must be in `device/manufacturer/device-name/sepolicy` to handle vendor-specific details."
 "C": "Attributes cannot be extended in `system/sepolicy/public` due to compatibility guarantees, and policy must be in `device/manufacturer/device-name/sepolicy` to cater to vendor-specific details."
 "D": "Extending attributes in `system/sepolicy/public` is allowed for direct labeling of `/vendor` objects, and the policy should be in `system/sepolicy/private` to use system-only types."
Answer: C
