User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of four child processes (1901, 1898, 1912, 1915, 1913, 1914) in scoreboard slots 6, 9, 7, and 8, respectively. The workerEnv.init() process is successful for each of the four processes, but the mod_jk child workerEnv is in error state 6 for all four processes.
