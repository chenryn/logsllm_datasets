  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
JSS expanded syntax should affect styling in the same manner as regular
styles. I would expect that both red and blue boxes render exactly the same
given that they're technically applying the same styles.
## Current Behavior
In both beta 21 and beta 24 part (or all) of the styling doesn't apply
properly. Notice the differences in padding between the red (JSS expand) and
blue (regular styles) boxes
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

Beta 21 example: https://codesandbox.io/s/myznn5lmk9
## Context
This impacts both material UI components, or custom components using JSS
expand.
