User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: At 03-17 16:13:47, the WindowManager took a screenshot from a Surface with a crop, width, height, minLayer, and maxLayer. The NotificationManager then updated the lights and turned off the notification light. The StackScrollAlgorithm then updated the clipping and dimmed activated hide sensitive overlap multiple times. The PhoneStatusBar then removed a notification and updated the notification shade, and finally animated the collapse panels.
