From #929 and #1226, I believe that the intended behaviour is that extension-
less shebang scripts are seen as TypeScript files, but that does not seems to
be the case?
Minimal example:
    #!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-all
    // filename: hi
    interface Foo {
      bar: string;
    }
    console.log("Hi");
Running `./hi` or `deno run hi` yields `error: Unexpected token `interface`.`
