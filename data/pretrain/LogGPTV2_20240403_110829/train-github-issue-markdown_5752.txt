Navbar dropdown links work fine normally in Chrome, but when navbar is
collapsed links do not have any hover state and clicking on links just
collapses the dropdown menu.
JSFiddle is here.. http://jsfiddle.net/richyclarke/urbnD/3/
Collapse the navbar by reducing the frame size and try to click on the 'IBM'
link under the main navbar li 'Links'. It works in Internet Explorer (IE10 and
maybe others) but not in Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest) or IOS devices
(Chrome or Safari browser on iPad or iPhone)
This used to work in Bootstrap 2.1.x but has stopped working since 2.2.0 and
still doesn't work in 2.3.x
