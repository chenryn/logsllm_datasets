Force a newly opened application to open up on the monitor from which it was
started, regardless if it was started from the start menu or from the taskbar.
Three monitor setup with 3 taskbars and 3 start buttons.
Some applications always open on the primary monitor, some on monitor 3 and
some on monitor 2. I have yet to find any logic behind where it opens.
When I click on the VS icon on the taskbar of monitor 2, that is where it
should open.
Then if an application opens a pop up window it should open that on the same
window as the application.
