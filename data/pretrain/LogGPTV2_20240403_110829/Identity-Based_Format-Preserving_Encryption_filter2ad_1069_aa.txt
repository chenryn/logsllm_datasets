the 
characteristics of the encrypted data format and the same data

reducing the cost of modifying the data format. The analysis of

problems  such  as  low  key  transmission  security  and  high  key 
management  cost.  This  paper  proposes  an  identity-based

INTRODUCTION 
With the rapid development of big data, the security of a 
large number of sensitive information has attracted attention 
from  all  parties,  such  as  bank  card  numbers,  passwords, 
addresses, mobile phone numbers and other information that 
must  not  be  disclosed  without  authorization  is  sensitive 
information.  In  order  to  ensure  the  confidentiality,  integrity 
and availability of information transmitted over the network, 
various  security  schemes  have  been  introduced.  Most  of  the 
existing  database  encryption  schemes  will  expand  the  data 
after  encryption,  causing  the  data  length  and  data  type  to 
change [1]. For the encryption of database sensitive data, it is 
necessary  to  ensure  that  the  ciphertext  meets  the  constraints 
of the database on the data format, mainly including that the 
encrypted data type cannot be changed and the data cannot be 
expanded.  Encrypting  sensitive  information  needs  to  ensure 
that  not  only  the basic  format  of  type  and  length  is  retained 
after  encryption,  but  also  that  user-defined  data  integrity 
constraints  are  not  broken.  Format-Preserving  Encryption 
(FPE) can preserve the original format of the plain text, and 
encrypt  the  plain  text  of  a  certain  format  into  a  cipher  text 
with the same format. 
The  format  preservation  encryption  problem  was  first 
raised by  the  American Bureau  of  Standards [2]  in 1981.  In 
2008,  Spies  [3]  linked  FPE  with  the  protection  of  sensitive 
information in the database and proposed a scheme based on 
FPE  to  protect  personally  identifiable  information  in  the 
database.  In  2009,  Bellare  [4]  extended  the  Feistel  finite  set 
encryption model in terms of message space, Feistel network 
[5]  type  and  round  operation,  and  proposed  a  Feistel-Based 
Format-Preserving  (FFX)  model  based  on  Feistel  network  . 
This  model  can  solve  the  FPE  problem  in  a  message  space 
consisting  of  a  string  of  length  n.  In  2010,  Morris  [6] 
improved the FFX, described in detail the use of adjustment 
factors,  and  proposed  a  model  based  on  block  ciphers. 
Cipher-Block Chaining Mode (CBC) can be used to encrypt 
arbitrary lengths. String and retain its format. In 2011, Liu et 
al.[7] proposed a new model of encoding first and encryption 
based  on  the  research  of  the  current  format  retention 
encryption  model.  In  2012,  Li  et  al.  [8]  proposed  a  Feistel 
network  retention  format  encryption  scheme  based  on 
k-segmentation,  which  supports  FPE  encryption  of  data  of 
various  lengths.  Li  et al. [9] proposed  two  FPE  schemes  for 
variable-length  encoded  character  data  in  2012.  In  2016, 
Bellare  [15]  proposed  a  Feistel-based  format-encrypted 
message recovery attack. In 2017, Wang et al. [16] proposed 
a  multi-type  data retention  format  encryption  technology.  In 
2018,  Zhang  et  al.  [10]  proposed  a  research  on  the  retained 
format encryption technology for big data distribution. 
In  the  traditional  format  retention  encryption  scheme, 
the  key  K  is  stored  in  different  devices,  and  each  device  is 
encrypted directly under K. However, the device is at risk of 
side-channel  attacks  due  to  physical  factors.  This  paper 
proposes  an  Identity-Based  Format-Preserving  Encryption 
Scheme(IBSIFPE) based on the format-preserving encryption 
scheme  proposed  by  Bellare  [11].  Sensitive  information  is 
encrypted  and  protected.  At  the  same  time,  it  reduces  the 
storage  and  legality  verification  of  public  key  certificates, 
improves  the  security  of  information  transmission,  and 
reduces the facilities required for key management systems. 
The  IBSIFPE  scheme  proposed  in  this  article  has  the 
following characteristics: 
[1]  Compared  with  the  existing  FPE  scheme,  the  IBSIFPE 
scheme  in  this  paper  is  implemented  in  a  hybrid 
encryption  system,  which  simplifies  key  management 
and  avoids the  security risk of  transmitting  keys  before 
communication.

require  a  certificate  authority.  Key  Derivation 
Functions  (KDF)  are  used  to  generate  encryption  and 
decryption  keys.  Even  if  the  adversary  intercepts  the 
ciphertext and public key, it cannot be cracked. 
[3]  The  security  goal  of  this  solution  is  pseudo-random 
permutation security. An identity ID is added to the key 
generation  process  to  uniquely  identify  its  identity 
information,  which  improves  communication  security. 
And  it  has  adaptive  selection  of  indistinguishable 
security under plaintext attacks.

IBFPESI SCHEME DEFINITION 
Setup:  Enter  system  parameters  to  generate  system 
public parameters. 
Public-Key-Extract: Calculate the user's public key. 
Private-Key-Extract:  Calculate  and  generate  the  user 
key. 
Encap:  Sender  generates  an  encryption  key  through  a 
key derivation function. 
Enc:  Sender  uses  the  encryption  key  to  encrypt  the 
message and outputs the ciphertext. 
  Decap:  Receiver generates a  decryption  key through a 
key derivation function. 
  Dec:  Receiver  uses  the  decryption  key  to  decrypt  the 
ciphertext and outputs the plaintext. 
III.  SECURITY MODEL

The  security  goal  of  the  format-preserving  encryption 
standard is Pseudo Random Permutation (PRP) [12] security, 
which  requires  that  attackers  cannot  distinguish  whether  to 
retain 
random 
permutation in the message space set. The IBSIFPE scheme 
also  needs  to  meet  PRP  security.  That  is,  even  if  the 
adversary  can  intercept  the  ciphertext  and  public  key,  the 
encrypted information cannot be cracked. Moreover, the key 
is  associated  with  the  identity  ID,  and  even  if  the  damage 
caused by the loss of the decryption key is  maintained only 
under  that  identity,  it  will  not  affect  the  communication 
security of other identities. 
Encrypted  prediction:  The  adversary  A  enters  the 
message  M,  B  executes  the  corresponding  algorithm 
and returns the ciphertext C. 
  Decryption  prediction  query:  Adversary  A  enters 
cipher  text  C,  B  executes  the  corresponding  algorithm 
and returns message M. 
Identity  query:  A  queries  the  identity  ID,  and  B 
executes the corresponding algorithm to return the user 
key. 
  Challenge:  A  generates  two  plaintexts  of  the  same
