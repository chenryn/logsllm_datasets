User: grr.  I'm struggling with Vim's learning curve.
And trying to get a simple mapping in my vimrc to execute the current buffer's python script. 
The mapping is well-formed and works after I enter it into the command line in Vim. This is the mapping:

    map <buffer> <S-e> :w<CR>:!usr/bin/env python % <CR>

But it won't load from my vimrc :(  I'm using the basic .vimrc_sample with only this mapping appended.  What's weird is that I could get a different mapping working from the vimrc:

    map <S-t> itest<Esc>

This one works, but not the script executer?  What gives?
Ubuntu 10.10 Python 2.6 Vim 7.2  
Help is very appreciated!

After searching for an answer for an hour, 1 min after posting this q I solved it. The problem was <buffer> in the mapping.
Removing it made the mapping work, thus:
    nnoremap E w:<CR>:!python % <CR>
