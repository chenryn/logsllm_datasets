The light and dark themes have recently been in the center of attention due to
colors being added and removed again.
More colors became visible due to the update of tokenizers in November. In
December we decided to remove these again, to stay in sync with the classic
Visual Studio Dark and Light themes.
From reactions in #1270 and #1470 and other issues, we learned that we have
fans of both the classic Visual Studio dark and light themes as well as the
more colorful version, e.g., from comment
> The `Dark` and `Light` default themes were very nice in 0.10.3, I'm already
> missing them.
So we decided to bring the colors back in new themes, 'Dark+' and 'Light+'.

You can currently try these out by installing the extension 'Colorful Default
Themes'. The plan is to add them to the built-in themes in the January build.
In addition to 4 major colors in the Visual Studio themes (comments, strings,
numbers and keywords) we now have again colors for
  * control flow keywords
  * type names
  * function names
  * parameter names

When trying the new themes out, you will still find some keywords like
'import', 'module' nor correctly highlighted. These are issues in the
tokenizer that we are working on. Please post your findings here, if possible
add a code snippet and don't forget to mention for what language it is :-)
