statistics and our measurements, we estimate that at most
10-25% of all Skype users are online at a given instance.
3.2 Yahoo! Instant Messenger
We obtained two datasets5 related to Yahoo! Instant Mes-
senger (YIM) through the Yahoo! Webscope program which
describe: (i) how active the YIM users are during a day [7],
and (ii) how YIM users communicate with each other over
a month [8].
YIM Client-to-Server Protocol-Level Events [7]. This
dataset contains two parts. The ﬁrst part comprises 148,176,335
protocol events logged by 4,665,328 unique users in a 24-
hour period in June 2010. Around 200 protocol events such
as ‘logging in’, ‘sending IM’, ‘accepting buddy invite’, and
‘sending ﬁles’ are logged with each record (t, u) represent-
ing an event generated by a user u at time t. However, the
type of an event is not logged. The second part comprises
5,320,505 message event records of the form (t, u1, u2) indi-
cating who-messaged-whom among users in the ﬁrst part at
what time but only during this 24-hour period.
Unfortunately, this dataset [7] does not contain explicit
information about the begin and end times of user sessions.
To circumvent this limitation, we infer sessions based on
user inactivity. As it is known that the keep alive messages
have a periodicity of one hour in YIM [17], we consider that
if a user sends at least one message in the (t)-th hour of the
trace but not in the (t + 1)-th hour, this user has a session
ending before the (t + 1)-th hour. The possible side eﬀect
of this heuristic is that in some situations where a user goes
oﬄine and comes back online in less than an hour, the two
sessions will be considered as a contiguous one. Neverthe-
less, our analyses in this work are not concerned with the
number of sessions a user has, or with very-short-term dy-
namics. Therefore, the expected eﬀect of considering these
5Although the datasets are quite large, there are a couple of lim-
itations. First, the data selection process for these datasets is not
made public. Second, these datasets are completely independent
of each other in the sense that users across both the datasets are
not the same. Nevertheless, we believe that we can draw reason-
able inferences of the system in general since both the datasets
belong to the same instant messaging system.
two sessions as one is very limited. With this assumption in
mind, we next study the hourly dynamics of YIM clients.
Figure 3(a) shows the percentage of users who are online
during a particular hour with respect to all the users who
are online at any instance during the 24-hour period. The
analysis of this period can be divided into 4 parts. First,
from 4 AM to 9 AM, we see a steady growth of users joining
the network with 4% of online users at 4 AM to 15% at 9
AM. Second, from 9 AM to 4 PM, nearly 15% of users are
online every hour with a marginal drop at 2 PM which may
be due to users having lunch during this period. Third, from
4 PM to 9 PM, online users reduce to 13% at 6-7 PM and
increase back to 15% at 9 PM. The drop may be due to users
leaving for their homes and having dinner, while the rise is
perhaps post-dinner online time. Fourth, from 9 PM to 4
AM, online users drop from 15% at 9 PM to 4% at 4 AM.
Figure 3(b) plots the percentage of users online in the
previous hour who continue to be online in the current hour.
Each hour sees at least a third of all users online from the
previous hour almost throughout the day. From 9 AM to
5 PM, over 40% of users are observed in subsequent hourly
time intervals. Late night sees a variance in users being
online across each hour with less than 30% of them being
common from 4 AM at 5 AM.
Figure 3(c) plots the percentage of users observed in t
hourly time intervals. About half of all users are seen only
in one time interval and nearly 90% of all users are observed
in 5 or fewer time intervals, while less than 5% of all users
