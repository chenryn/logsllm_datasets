### Optimized Text

In order to exploit these domains, an adversary must analyze and implement infrastructure specific to each domain. Although we have demonstrated that a third party can likely identify the type of service previously offered on an expired domain, reverse engineering the necessary details for exploitation may be nontrivial.

#### False Positives

Given the highly-specific nature of our trust filters, particularly for HTTP(S) traffic, false positives are unlikely. Our filters identify domains with significant trust traffic by looking for requests to residual paths (paths that existed on the domain before it expired). These residual paths require knowledge of the service previously offered by the domain. We consider the likelihood of false positives from using residual paths as low for several reasons:

1. **Search Engine Indexers and Archives**: These entities are likely aware of residual paths but can be easily identified by their User-Agent headers and filtered out as bot traffic.
2. **Unfamiliar Users**: Those who are unfamiliar with the previous service offered on the domain are unlikely to guess a residual path, as they only include service-relevant paths and exclude common paths.
3. **Content Consistency**: Since our containers serve the same content to all requests, multiple attempts do not provide additional information.
4. **Third-Party References**: Users who gain knowledge of the previous service from third-party references (e.g., forum posts or search engine results) are effectively discovering a new service and visiting the domain, which is a form of residual trust.

Another potential source of false positives is our use of fingerprints. However, recent work indicates that most bots and crawlers do not support JavaScript [33]. Of those that do, they either lack full support or are still likely to fall for our bot traps.

A less obvious factor that could introduce more traffic and false positives is the acquisition of a TLS certificate for each domain. Certificate Transparency (CT) [76] is a key component of the public key infrastructure ecosystem on the web, introducing publicly auditable certificate transparency logs. Although we did not explicitly advertise our domains, the issuance of TLS certificates indirectly advertised them, potentially attracting traffic from CT log monitors. However, these clients are still bots and will likely exhibit behaviors targeted by our bot-detection filters. Therefore, it is unlikely that requests from CT monitors were flagged as residual trust-related traffic.

#### Going Forward

Our residual trust traffic detection pipeline has demonstrated a clear and pressing potential for abuse in expired domains. While there are some configurable variables in our experiment and analysis methodology, such as domain selection strategy and the specific passive DNS database used, changing these variables is unlikely to result in contradictory findings. Attackers exploiting residual trust can conduct a range of attacks, including stealing personally identifiable information (PII), infecting devices, reviving botnets, and bypassing web security mechanisms.

Although there are countermeasures for specific instances of residual-trust abuse (such as Subresource Integrity, SRI, which can protect remote first-party websites against malicious changes in remote scripts [77]), there are currently no recommended defense mechanisms against the overall problem of residual trust abuse.

An ideal defense mechanism would need to systematically define the integrity of a domain, accounting for features such as ownership and domain content, and determine whether it has changed or been compromised, as proposed by Lever et al. [1]. The recent move to anonymize WHOIS data has increased the privacy of domain owners but also removed information that could be used to detect changes in domain ownership.

Additionally, increased monitoring and asset-management capabilities have the potential to provide early warnings to developers and administrators. Given the domain-expiration timeline defined by ICANN, a domain will stop resolving for at least 30 days before it becomes publicly available for re-registration. With the right monitoring infrastructure, this should enable everyone who depends on a domain to discover the impending drop and make the necessary changes before the domain changes hands.

In conclusion, this paper demonstrates that a top-down, target-agnostic approach relying on past resolution data to identify residual-trust domains can offer attackers access to millions of users and thousands of systems, for the cost of a few well-chosen domain registrations. We re-registered 201 domains, developed traffic analysis pipelines to detect residual trust traffic, and successfully profiled 128 domains to develop domain-specific indicators of residual trust derived from the type of services they previously offered. We reported on the types of traffic received and detailed the process of differentiating traffic from bots and traffic due to residual trust via various filters based on architectural elements, request characteristics, and external IP blocklists. Even after aggressive filtering, our pool of domain names attracted requests from over 2.6 million IP addresses, which attempted to connect to torrent trackers, malware C&C servers, email trackers, college-lab software, and online radio stations. We hope this paper rekindles the community’s interest in detecting and protecting against cases of domain-name-based residual trust.
