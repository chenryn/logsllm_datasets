to implement new security requirements like CT. As discussed
in Section VI-B3, users might simply switch to another
browser in the face of an attack or misconﬁguration.
Initial
implementation can be a substantial engineering
effort. For example, Firefox’s experimental CT implementation
has been disabled by default for over a year due to unresolved
regressions [33]. Firefox developers have expressed concerns
about whether the security properties of CT are valuable
enough to warrant this investment [54].
Finally, CT presents an ongoing maintenance burden, and
when bugs are introduced, they can be costly. This is illustrated
by the Chrome bug discussed in Section VI-B3, in which
out-of-date builds displayed spurious CT warnings, frustrating
users and in some cases inducing them to switch browsers.
X. OPEN PROBLEMS
Even after all browsers require SCTs for all websites, other
parts of CT need to be deployed to achieve the system’s full
security goals. Below we discuss open CT research areas and
how they might impact end users.
A. Log auditing
CT deﬁnes protocols for auditing logs and verifying that
they are behaving correctly. Experimental implementations of
these technologies exist but are not yet widely deployed [55],
[56]. Widespread log auditing may yet reveal two sources of
disruption to end users. First, it might uncover log misbe-
havior that is currently going unnoticed, leading to more log
disqualiﬁcations. Indeed, early implementations have already
noticed misbehavior that resulted in log disqualiﬁcations [57],
[58]. Second, log auditing protocols pose interesting questions
about the privacy of end user browsing habits [59]. Once such
protocols are fully speciﬁed and deployed, there is more work
to be done to understand the actual impact on users’ privacy
and how it matches users’ security and privacy expectations.
B. Name redaction
Various organizations have expressed the desire to be able to
log certiﬁcates while redacting the full domain name from the
logged certiﬁcate [60]. Some domain names, such as internal
corporate hostnames, are understandably secret, but
these
hostnames can leak in various other ways (for example, DNS
queries and domain registrations). Moreover, the goal of CT
– full transparency into the issuance of public certiﬁcates – is
compromised if browsers accept SCTs for redacted certiﬁcates.
The community has not yet settled on whether it is desirable
to allow information to be redacted from logged certiﬁcates.
As CT enforcement rolls out more broadly, websites might
choose to not log their certiﬁcates due to lack of redaction

support in browsers, resulting in warnings for end users. Future
work on name redaction can elucidate this risk by examining
redaction use cases, analyzing the security properties of the
current proposals, and exploring alternatives.
C. User reaction to CT errors
Chrome currently displays CT errors with a UI that
is
similar to other certiﬁcate validation errors, such as an expired
certiﬁcate. In Section VI-B, we explore how users react to
these errors by analyzing clickthrough rate and Chrome help
forum posts, but future work can explore users’ reactions to
CT errors in more depth. For example, why do users proceed
through CT errors at a higher rate than other certiﬁcate errors,
and is there a better UI for communicating CT errors to users?
Answers to these questions can help inform the warning design
in Chrome and other browsers as they adopt CT.
XI. RELATED WORK
A. Browser warnings
Warnings science. A long line of work establishes the
harm of frequent warnings, which motivates our desire to
minimize warnings introduced by CT enforcement. B¨ohme
et al. argue that false alarms consume from a user’s ﬁnite
lump-of-attention [2]. The negative effect of frequent warnings
and prompts has been studied extensively in the context of
permissions systems [61], [62], web browser warnings [3],
[63], and popup dialogs like installation prompts [64], [65].
Causes of HTTPS errors. Several studies have examined
the causes of HTTPS certiﬁcate errors. Acer et al. collected
reports from browser warnings to analyze the top causes of
false-positive certiﬁcate errors in the wild [18]. This study did
not analyze CT errors speciﬁcally, perhaps because CT errors
are rare relative to other types of certiﬁcate errors. Previous
work, predating the widespread deployment of CT, studied the
underlying causes of certiﬁcate errors from passive network
observations [66] and by surveying developers [67].
B. Web PKI measurement
CT measurement. Perhaps most related to our work are
previous studies of the CT ecosystem. Amann et al. combined
passive and active scans to measure the adoption of several
new web PKI technologies,
including CT [43]. Like us,
they conclude that CT has gained signiﬁcant momentum and
adoption, largely thanks to the investments of large ecosystem
players like Google. We observe a higher percentage of CT-
compliant trafﬁc than in their study, likely due to differences
in vantage point or time (Fig. 4). We also corroborate their
ﬁnding that Symantec’s name stripping option, described in
Section V-A, is a common source of invalid SCTs.
In contrast to Amann et al.’s study, we provide measure-
ments focused on the user experience of CT, particularly
related to errors and breakage. We speciﬁcally measure how
many connections are required to be CT-compliant but aren’t.
We also report CT compliance against the exact Chrome CT
policy, whereas Amman et al. use a simpliﬁed version of
the policy, only checking whether a connection contains one
Google and one non-Google SCT. The nuances of the complete
policy account for some of the top noncompliant sites that
cause CT errors in Chrome (Section V-A).
VanderSloot et al. focus on building a complete view of
publicly issued certiﬁcates by collecting certiﬁcates from CT
logs as well as other sources [68]. Their work assesses how
well CT represents the corpus of certiﬁcates used on the public
internet, whereas our study measures the adoption of CT on
the web and the breakage that it imposes on users.
Gustafsson et al. characterize the differences in size, growth
rate, and certiﬁcate acceptance policies among various CT
logs [69]. This work is primarily concerned with characterizing
the certiﬁcate ecosystem from the logs’ perspective, and also
provides a view of log coverage of popular domains based
on a one-week passive observation of a university network. In
contrast, our work is concerned with how much web trafﬁc
successfully serves SCTs (as opposed to how many websites
use certiﬁcates that appear in CT logs).
HTTPS measurement. Our paper builds on work that mea-
sures the HTTPS ecosystem more generally. Felt et al. propose
a variety of metrics and perspectives for measuring HTTPS
adoption [50]. Internet-wide scans and passive measurements
are used in several other works to identify trends in certiﬁcate
issuance and HTTPS adoption [70]–[73]. Our work adapts
these methods for measuring CT adoption: for example, we
consider both HTTP request and page load metrics for CT
compliance, as Felt et al. do for HTTPS adoption [50].
C. Building on CT
In Section X, we identify several areas of future work that
can help minimize the negative end user impact of CT. Early
work has begun to explore these areas, particularly in protocols
to uncover log misbehavior. This work includes gossip proto-
cols [74] and privacy-preserving schemes that allow clients
and other parties to discover and report misbehavior [75].
XII. CONCLUSION
Certiﬁcate Transparency can improve the security of the
web PKI, but end users will suffer if they are inundated
with warnings and breakage as CT enforcement rolls out. In
this paper, we showed that Certiﬁcate Transparency has been
adopted across a signiﬁcant fraction of the web with minimal
breakage for end users. When users do encounter errors or
warnings, however, they react unsafely, so it is critical to CT’s
success that breakage rates stay low. We further measured and
studied risks in CT deployment that could cause disruption for
end users in future: namely, the risks of log disqualiﬁcations
and improperly implemented server-side SCT delivery. We
observed that CT’s success so far can be attributed to a
number of design properties: for example, CT can be deployed
by a small number of ﬁrst-movers, and widespread adoption
does not require individual action by site owners. Finally, we
identiﬁed hurdles in the deployment of CT that might present
challenges to similar systems in future.
