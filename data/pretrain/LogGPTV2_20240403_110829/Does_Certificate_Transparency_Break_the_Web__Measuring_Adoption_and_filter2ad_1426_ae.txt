### Implementation of New Security Requirements: Certificate Transparency (CT)

Implementing new security requirements, such as Certificate Transparency (CT), can be a significant engineering challenge. As discussed in Section VI-B3, users may switch to another browser if they encounter an attack or misconfiguration. For instance, Firefox’s experimental CT implementation has been disabled by default for over a year due to unresolved regressions [33]. Firefox developers have expressed concerns about whether the security benefits of CT justify the investment [54].

Furthermore, CT imposes an ongoing maintenance burden, and any introduced bugs can be costly. This is exemplified by a Chrome bug discussed in Section VI-B3, where outdated builds displayed spurious CT warnings, leading to user frustration and, in some cases, browser switching.

### Open Problems

Even after all browsers require Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) for all websites, additional aspects of CT need to be deployed to achieve the system's full security goals. Below, we discuss open research areas in CT and their potential impact on end users.

#### A. Log Auditing

CT defines protocols for auditing logs and verifying their correct behavior. While experimental implementations exist, they are not yet widely deployed [55], [56]. Widespread log auditing could reveal two sources of disruption for end users:

1. **Log Misbehavior**: Early implementations have already uncovered log misbehavior leading to log disqualifications [57], [58]. Further auditing might uncover more such issues.
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Log auditing protocols raise questions about the privacy of end-user browsing habits [59]. More work is needed to understand the actual impact on users' privacy and how it aligns with their expectations.

#### B. Name Redaction

Some organizations desire the ability to log certificates while redacting the full domain name from the logged certificate [60]. Internal corporate hostnames, for example, are often confidential, but they can leak through other means, such as DNS queries and domain registrations. Allowing redaction compromises the goal of full transparency in public certificate issuance. The community has not yet decided whether redaction should be allowed. If CT enforcement rolls out more broadly without redaction support, websites might choose not to log their certificates, resulting in warnings for end users. Future work on name redaction can help by examining use cases, analyzing the security properties of current proposals, and exploring alternatives.

#### C. User Reaction to CT Errors

Chrome currently displays CT errors using a UI similar to other certificate validation errors, such as expired certificates. In Section VI-B, we explore user reactions to these errors by analyzing click-through rates and Chrome help forum posts. Future work can delve deeper into why users proceed through CT errors at a higher rate than other certificate errors and whether a better UI can communicate CT errors more effectively. Answers to these questions can inform warning design in Chrome and other browsers as they adopt CT.

### Related Work

#### A. Browser Warnings

**Warnings Science**: Research has shown that frequent warnings can be harmful, motivating our efforts to minimize warnings introduced by CT enforcement. Böehme et al. argue that false alarms consume a user's finite attention [2]. The negative effects of frequent warnings and prompts have been extensively studied in the context of permissions systems [61], [62], web browser warnings [3], [63], and popup dialogs like installation prompts [64], [65].

**Causes of HTTPS Errors**: Several studies have examined the causes of HTTPS certificate errors. Acer et al. analyzed the top causes of false-positive certificate errors in the wild [18]. Previous work, predating widespread CT deployment, studied the underlying causes of certificate errors from passive network observations [66] and developer surveys [67].

#### B. Web PKI Measurement

**CT Measurement**: Studies related to the CT ecosystem include Amann et al., who combined passive and active scans to measure the adoption of several new web PKI technologies, including CT [43]. They concluded that CT has gained significant momentum, largely due to investments by major players like Google. Our study observes a higher percentage of CT-compliant traffic, likely due to differences in vantage point or time (Fig. 4). We also corroborate their finding that Symantec’s name stripping option is a common source of invalid SCTs.

In contrast, our study focuses on the user experience of CT, particularly related to errors and breakage. We measure how many connections are required to be CT-compliant but aren't and report CT compliance against the exact Chrome CT policy. VanderSloot et al. focus on building a complete view of publicly issued certificates by collecting certificates from CT logs and other sources [68]. Their work assesses how well CT represents the corpus of certificates used on the public internet, whereas our study measures CT adoption and its impact on users.

Gustafsson et al. characterize the differences in size, growth rate, and certificate acceptance policies among various CT logs [69]. This work provides a view of log coverage of popular domains based on a one-week passive observation of a university network. Our work, on the other hand, is concerned with how much web traffic successfully serves SCTs.

**HTTPS Measurement**: Our paper builds on work measuring the HTTPS ecosystem more generally. Felt et al. propose various metrics and perspectives for measuring HTTPS adoption [50]. Internet-wide scans and passive measurements are used in several works to identify trends in certificate issuance and HTTPS adoption [70]–[73]. Our work adapts these methods for measuring CT adoption, considering both HTTP request and page load metrics for CT compliance, as Felt et al. do for HTTPS adoption [50].

#### C. Building on CT

In Section X, we identify several areas of future work that can help minimize the negative impact of CT on end users. Early work has begun to explore these areas, particularly in protocols to uncover log misbehavior. This includes gossip protocols [74] and privacy-preserving schemes that allow clients and other parties to discover and report misbehavior [75].

### Conclusion

Certificate Transparency can improve the security of the web PKI, but end users will suffer if they are inundated with warnings and breakage as CT enforcement rolls out. In this paper, we showed that CT has been adopted across a significant fraction of the web with minimal breakage for end users. When users encounter errors or warnings, they react unsafely, making it critical to keep breakage rates low. We further measured and studied risks in CT deployment that could cause disruption for end users in the future, such as the risks of log disqualifications and improperly implemented server-side SCT delivery. We observed that CT's success so far can be attributed to several design properties, such as the ability to deploy by a small number of first-movers and the fact that widespread adoption does not require individual action by site owners. Finally, we identified hurdles in the deployment of CT that might present challenges to similar systems in the future.
