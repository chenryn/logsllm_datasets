  * VSCode Version: 1.1.1
  * OS Version: OSX 10.11.4
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Insert the following TypeScript code into the editor:
    var a = true ? true : `;`;
    var i;
  1. Observe that `var i;` is colored as if it were part of the template string (in VSCode, and on GitHub!).

Removing any part of the first line prevents the bug. It only appears to occur
when combining variable assignment, the ternary operator, and a template
string containing a semicolon (`;`).
Further Info:
A single occurrence of this bug can derail syntax highlighting for the rest of
the file, since template strings are multi-line. Template strings with
semicolons can be a common occurrence for projects that generate JavaScript as
output, and ternaries are a common case when wanting to handle a slight
variation in output.
