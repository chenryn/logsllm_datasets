I am using the BCELoss for input and target with size of batchsize * channel *
height * width, I also want to weight the loss using a weight matrix of the
same size, then I get the below error:
File "/home/nianliu/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-
packages/torch/nn/_functions/thnn/loss.py", line 15, in _resize_weight  
self.weight = self.weight.view(1, target.size(1)).expand_as(target)  
RuntimeError: size '[1 x 1]' is invalid for input of with 320 elements at
/py/conda-bld/pytorch_1493680494901/work/torch/lib/TH/THStorage.c:59
Apparently, on this line, it's incorrect to reshape the weight matrix to the
size of 1*target.size(1), unless only the channel-wise weights are allowed.
Since one may want to use sample-wise weights, channel-wise weights, pixel-
wise weights, element-wise weights (jusk like my case), or other forms, I
think we may remove the expanding operation and let users do it by themselves
to ensure the flexibility.
