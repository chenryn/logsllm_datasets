### Title: Exploiting Windows Hello for Business in EU-19

**Abstract:**

In Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, Microsoft introduced Windows Hello for Business (WHfB), a feature designed to enable password-less authentication in Active Directory-based environments. WHfB aims to reduce the risk of password theft by leveraging well-known industry standards such as Kerberos PKINIT, JWT, WS-Trust, and FIDO2, and by employing advanced cryptographic mechanisms like TPM key attestation and token binding.

Despite its potential, WHfB is complex and lacks comprehensive management tools and detailed technical documentation. This makes it a black box for many administrators, security auditors, and penetration testers.

**Key Findings:**

During our analysis of the current WHfB implementation in Windows, we identified several new attack vectors that could lead to privilege escalation and persistence. Our most significant discovery is a novel type of persistent Active Directory backdoor that, to our knowledge, is not detected by existing security solutions and audit procedures. Even organizations that do not actively use WHfB may be at risk from this threat.

We also found that following Microsoft's mitigation guide for a previously known vulnerability not only fails to fully secure Active Directory but can introduce additional security issues. These vulnerabilities can potentially result in Active Directory user impersonation without requiring any special Active Directory permissions.

**Presentation Overview:**

In this talk, we will:

1. **Detail the New Attack Vectors:** We will provide an in-depth analysis of the newly discovered attack vectors and their potential impact on corporate environments.
2. **Demonstrate a Novel Backdoor:** We will present our findings on the persistent Active Directory backdoor and discuss why it remains undetected by current security measures.
3. **Highlight Mitigation Issues:** We will explain how following Microsoft's mitigation guide for a known vulnerability can leave systems vulnerable and introduce new security risks.
4. **Introduce a New Toolset:** We will showcase a new set of tools designed to scan corporate environments for these vulnerabilities and provide actionable insights for resolution. These tools also offer much-needed visibility into WHfB usage within Active Directory.

By attending this talk, participants will gain a deeper understanding of the security challenges associated with WHfB and learn practical steps to mitigate these risks in their own environments.
