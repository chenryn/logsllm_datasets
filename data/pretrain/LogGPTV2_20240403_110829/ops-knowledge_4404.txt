Question: "Consider the implementation of a Struts framework ActionForm Bean. Which of the following options correctly describes the consequences of implementing a validate() method without calling super.validate(), and the benefits of including the call to super.validate()?"
 "A": "Not calling super.validate() disables the Struts default validation framework, potentially missing out on predefined validation routines."
 "B": "Including super.validate() call might cause performance issues due to redundant checks if the custom validation covers all necessary cases."
 "C": "Not calling super.validate() enables the form to bypass unnecessary validation steps, which might not be applicable to the specific form, enhancing performance."
 "D": "Calling super.validate() ensures that any global validation rules defined in separate configuration files are applied."
