Assistant: After solving a certain security vulnerability, please use the vulnerability scanning tool to detect whether there are other vulnerabilities in the system, and fix them in time. 1. Regularly update system patches and software versions to fix known vulnerabilities. 2. Enforce password policies and access controls, use strong passwords, and change passwords regularly. 3. Restrict unnecessary services and ports to reduce the attack surface of the system. 4. Monitor system logs to detect abnormal behaviors and potential attacks in time. 5. Conduct security stress tests to assess system security and discover potential vulnerabilities and risks. 6. Establish a disaster recovery and emergency response mechanism to deal with possible security incidents. The above measures can help ensure the security of the system and provide security after the bug is fixed.
