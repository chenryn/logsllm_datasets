 **Context:**
  * GOOD Playwright Version: 1.29.0
  * BAD Playwright Version: 1.35.1
  * Operating System: Mac
  * Extra: N/A
**Code Snippet**
Minimal repro:
    await page.setContent(`DISPLAY CONTENTS`)
    await expect(page.getByRole('button')).toBeVisible()
**Describe the bug**
Elements that use `display: contents;` are no longer deemed visible, breaking
a lot of our selectors when upgrading. I've found similar issues, however the
exact reproduction described in this issue seems to be working fine: #11202
This problem seems specific to getByRole.
I also was able to reproduce this issue in 1.32.0.
