backscattered information from the ambient signals using a conven-
tional digital receiver. We then describe an ultra-low-power receiver
design that uses only analog components.
3.3.1 Extracting Backscatter Information from
Ambient Signals
Ambient signals like TV and cellular transmissions encode infor-
mation and hence are not controllable. To illustrate this, Fig. 4(a)
shows an example of the time-domain ambient TV signal captured
on a USRP operating at 539 MHz. For comparison, Fig. 4(b) plots
the typical time domain signal received on a USRP from an RFID
reader transmitting at 915 MHz. While the traditional RFID trans-
mission is a constant amplitude signal, the ambient TV signal varies
signiﬁcantly in its instantaneous power. This is expected because
the captured ATSC TV signals encode information using 8VSB
modulation, which changes the instantaneous power of the trans-
mitted signal. Thus, the receiver should be capable of decoding the
backscattered signals in the presence of these fast changing signals.
In this section, we describe our mechanism assuming a powerful
digital receiver that samples the analog signal and performs demod-
ulation and decoding in the digital domain. In the next section, we
extend it to work using only analog components.
Our key insight is that if the transmitter backscatters information
at a lower rate than the ambient signals, then one can design a re-
ceiver that can separate the two signals by leveraging the difference
in communication rates. Speciﬁcally, ambient TV signals encode
information at a bandwidth of 6 MHz, so if we ensure that the trans-
mitter backscatters information at a larger time-scale than 6 MHz,
then the receiver can extract the backscattered information using av-
eraging mechanisms. Intuitively, this works because the wideband
ambient TV signals change at a fast rate and hence adjacent sam-
ples in TV signals tend to be more uncorrelated than the adjacent
samples in the backscattered signals. Thus, averaging the received
signal across multiple samples effectively removes the variations in

the wideband ambient TV signals, allowing the backscattered sig-
nals to be decoded.
For completeness, we formally describe why this works. Say
we have a digital receiver that samples the received signal at the
Nyquist-information rate of the TV signal. The received samples,
y[n], can then be expressed as a combination of the wideband TV
signals and the backscattered signals, i.e.,
y[n] = x[n] + αB[n]x[n] + w[n]
where x[n]s are the samples corresponding to the TV signal as re-
ceived by the receiver, w[n] is the noise, α is the complex atten-
uation of the backscattered signals relative to the TV signals, and
B[n] are the bits transmitted by the backscattering transmitter. Since
the receiver samples at the TV Nyquist rate, the adjacent samples
in x[n] are uncorrelated. Now, if the backscatterer conveys informa-
tion at a fraction of the rate, say 1
N , then B[Ni + j]s are all equal for
j = 1 to N.
If the receiver averages the instantaneous power in the N receiver
samples corresponding to a single backscattered bit, then we get:

the two power levels, |1 + α|2P and P, to decode the information
from the backscattering transmitter. Thus, even in the presence of
changes in the TV signal, the receiver can decode information from
the backscattering transmitter.

(b) Signal After Averaging
Figure 5—Comparison of backscattered signal received both with
(b) and without (a) averaging.
We apply the above mechanism to the ambient ATSC TV sig-
nals [2]. Speciﬁcally, we set our ambient backscattering transmitter
to transmit an alternating sequence of ones and zeros at a rate of
1kbps. Fig. 5(a) plots the received signal on an USRP that is placed
one foot from the transmitter. Fig. 5(b) plots the effect of averag-
ing every 100 received samples. As the ﬁgure shows, averaging re-
duces the effect of the fast-varying ambient TV signals. Further, the
receiver can now see two average power levels which it can use to
decode the backscattered information.
We note that ambient backscatter can either increase or decrease
the average power of the received signal. Speciﬁcally, the chan-
nel, α, is a complex number and hence |1 + α| can be either less
than or greater than one. This means that a zero bit can be either
a lower power than the average power, P, in the TV signal, or can
have a higher power than the average. Intuitively, this is because the
additional multi-path created by the backscattering transmitter can
either constructively or destructively interfere up with the existing
signal. We use differential coding to eliminate the need to know the
extra mapping between the power levels and the bits (see §4.1).
3.3.2 Decoding on an Ultra-Low-Power Device
The above design assumes that the receiver can get digital sam-
ples on which it can perform operations like averaging and compar-
ison of power levels. However, acquiring digital samples requires
an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) which can consume a signif-
icant amount of power and is typically avoided in ultra-low-power
designs [37]. In this section, we imitate the above operations in ana-
log hardware by selecting an appropriate analog circuit topology.
As shown in Fig. 6, our receiver has two stages: an envelope
detection and averaging circuit that smoothens out the natural vari-
ations in the TV signal, and a compute-threshold circuit that pro-
duces a threshold between the two levels. A comparator compares
the average envelope signal to the threshold to generate output bits.
is implemented using

smooth/average out the natural variations in the TV signals. As
shown in Fig. 6, it has two simple hardware elements: a diode and
a capacitor C1, and also makes use of a current path through two
serial resistors, R1 and R2. To a ﬁrst approximation, diodes act as

ulator has two stages: an envelope detection and averaging stage

one-way valves, allowing current to ﬂow in one direction but not the
other, capacitors are charge storage elements, and resistors regulate
current ﬂow. In this circuit, the diode provides charge whenever the
input voltage is greater than the voltage at the capacitor. During
the time period when the input is lower than the voltage on the ca-
pacitor, the diode does not provide charge and the resistors slowly
dissipate the energy stored on the capacitor, lowering the voltage.
The rate of drop of voltage is roughly determined by the product
C1(R1 + R2). Thus, by balancing the values of R1 and R2 against
the effective resistance of the diode and selecting an appropriate
capacitance, the circuit shown can act as a low-pass ﬁlter, averag-
ing out the fast natural variations in the TV signals but preserving
the slowly varying backscattered bits.
Compute-Threshold stage: The output of the averaging circuit
produces two signal levels, corresponding to the ‘0’ and the ‘1’ bits.
In principle, a receiver with an ADC can distinguish between the
two signal levels by processing the digital samples. Speciﬁcally, say
we have two signals with different voltages, V0 and V1, V1 > V0,
where V0 and V1 correspond to the power levels for the zero and one
bits. To distinguish between them, the receiver would ﬁrst compute
a threshold value which is the average of the two signal levels, i.e.,
V0+V1
. When the received signal is greater than this threshold, we
conclude that the received signal is V1; otherwise, we conclude that
the received signal is V0.
2
Since we choose to eliminate the need for a full ADC in order
to reduce power, the receiver imitates this operation using analog
hardware. Fig. 6 shows the hardware elements used by the compar-
ison circuit. It consists of an RC circuit and a comparator. The RC
circuit re-uses the two resistors (R1 and R2) and adds a capacitor
(C2) to perform further averaging, producing a threshold value of
near V0+V1
. The comparator takes two voltage values as inputs and
produces either a one or a zero to indicate which of the two values is
larger. The ﬁrst input to the comparator is the output of our average
envelope circuit and the second input is the threshold value.
2
We note that the bit rate of the prototype dictates the choice of
values for the RC circuit elements (e.g., a receiver operating at
10 kbps requires different RC values than one at 1 kbps). This is
because, at lower rates, each bit occupies more time on the channel
and hence requires more averaging to correctly compute the thresh-
old value. §5 describes the parameters used in our implementation.
Finally, while in theory we can distinguish between any two
power levels by sufﬁcient averaging, each comparator comes with
a minimum gap below which it cannot distinguish between the two
power levels. This gap determines the maximum distance at which
two devices can communicate with each other.
4. NETWORK STACK DESIGN
The network stack design for ambient backscatter communica-
tion is closely integrated with the properties of the circuits and the
43Figure 7—Packet Format: Each packet starts with an alternating
sequence of ‘1’s and ‘0’s followed by a preamble that is used by the
receiver to detect packets. The preamble is followed by a header and

hardware described so far. In this section, we explore the physical
layer and the link layer design for ambient backscatter.
4.1 Physical Layer
The physical layer for ambient backscatter communication ad-
dresses questions such as what modulation and coding to use, how
to perform packet detection, and how to ﬁnd bit boundaries.
Modulation and Bit Encoding: Since a backscattering transmitter
works by switching between reﬂecting and non-reﬂecting states, it
effectively creates an ON-OFF keying modulation. However, as de-
scribed earlier, the backscattered signal could either constructively
or destructively interfere with the ambient TV signal. Thus, depend-
ing on the receiver’s location, a ‘1’ bit could appear as either an
increase or a decrease in the received power. To address this issue,
the physical layer uses FM0 coding [17]. FM0 coding turns every
bit into two symbols and encodes information using symbol transi-
tions [17]. FM0 has a symbol transition at the beginning of every bit
period along with an additional mid-bit transition to represent a ‘1’,
and no such transition in the ‘0’ bit. Thus, bits are encoded using
transitions in the power level, rather than the actual power levels;
further, it guarantees an equal number of ‘0’ and ‘1’ symbols.
Detecting the Beginning of a Packet Transmission: At the begin-
ning of each packet transmission, an ambient backscattering trans-
mitter sends a known preamble that the receiver detects using bit-
level correlation on the digital hardware (in our case, the micro-
controller). However, unlike RFID communication, where the tags
correlate only when they are powered by a nearby reader, an am-
bient backscatter device does not know when nearby devices will
transmit and hence might have to continuously correlate, which is
power-consuming and impractical for a low-power device.
We avoid continuous correlation by only activating the relatively
expensive correlation process when the comparator detects bit tran-
sitions. The comparator hardware takes very little power and has
a built-in threshold before it detects bit transitions (in our imple-
mentation, this threshold is 2.4 mV). It is only when the power dif-
ference crosses this threshold that an interrupt is sent to the digital
hardware to wake it up from its idle state (to perform correlation).
Since the averaging circuit eliminates the large variations in the
ambient TV signal, it is unlikely that ambient signals alone create
changes in the power level in the absence of a packet transmission.
To provide the hardware with sufﬁcient leeway to wake up the
digital hardware, as shown in Fig. 7, the transmitter sends a longer
preamble that starts with an alternating 0-1 bit sequence before
