alleles will be deﬁned in future work. Note that health-
privacy metrics are valid at a given time, and cannot be used

3.5 Genomic-Privacy Preserving Mechanism
Individuals willing to share genomic data for research or
recreational purposes might be unwilling to share all their
DNA sequence, and thus need to properly obfuscate the sen-
sitive part(s) before releasing their genomic data. To do so,
their DNA will go through an obfuscation process, that we
call genomic-privacy preserving mechanism (GPPM). GPPM
can be implemented using one of the following techniques:
(i) hiding the SNPs, or (ii) reducing the precision or the
quantity of the revealed SNPs.
Hiding all or speciﬁc SNPs can be achieved either by not
releasing them or by encrypting them. Obviously, not re-
leasing any of the SNPs would hinder genetic research, thus
it is not a preferred way to protect the genomic privacy
of individuals. Instead of not releasing the SNPs, the use of
cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the genome is proposed.
For example, Kantarcioglu et al. propose using homomor-
phic encryption on the SNPs of the individuals to perform
genetic research on the encrypted SNPs [35]. However, the
security of an individual’s genome should be guaranteed for
at least 70-100 years (i.e., during the typical lifetime of a
human). As we show in this paper, even lifelong protection
is not enough, considering kin privacy implications (e.g., for
oﬀsprings).
It is known that even the best of the crypto-
graphic algorithms we use today could be broken in around
30 years. Therefore, the appropriateness of cryptographic
techniques for storing and processing the genomic data has
been questioned due to long-term security requirements of
the genomic data.
As an alternative to the cryptographic techniques, utility
(i.e., precision and quantity of the revealed SNPs) can be
traded for privacy. The precision of the revealed SNPs can
be reduced, for example, by revealing only one of the two
alleles of a SNP. Similarly, family members’ SNPs can be se-
lectively revealed by also considering the previously revealed
SNPs from the corresponding family (to keep the genomic
privacy of other family members above a desired threshold):
we evaluate the privacy provided by this technique in Sec-
tion 4 by assessing the inference power of the adversary for
diﬀerent fractions of observed data from a targeted family.
Eventually, using one of the above techniques, the GPPM
will take X as input and output XK as the set of revealed
SNPs. We note that a detailed implementation of the GPPM
by using one of the aforementioned techniques is out of the
scope of this work. We plan to study it in the future.
5These contributions are determined as a result of medical
studies. Some SNPs might increase (or decrease) the risk
for a disease more than others.

4. EVALUATION
In this section, we ﬁrst evaluate the performance of the
proposed inference attack, then compare the performance
of the inference with and without considering the linkage
disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs, and ﬁnally evaluate the
entropy-based metrics with respect to the expected estima-
tion error in quantifying the genomic privacy.
For this evaluation, we use the CEPH/Utah Pedigree 1463
that contains the partial DNA sequences of 17 family mem-
bers (4 grandparents, 2 parents, and 11 children) [23]. We
note in Fig. 4 that we only use 5 (out of 11) children for our
evaluation because (i) 11 is much above the average number
of children per family, (ii) we observe that the strength of
adversary’s inference does not increase further (due to the
children’s revealed genomes) when more that 5 children’s
genomes are revealed, and (iii) the belief propagation algo-
rithm (in Section 3.2) might have convergence issues due to
the number of loops in the factor graph, and this number
increases with the number of children. As the SNPs related
to important diseases, like Alzheimer’s, are not included in
this dataset, we quantify health privacy in Section 5 by using
the data collected from a genome-sharing website.
To quantify the genomic privacy of the individuals in the
CEPH family, we focus on their SNPs on chromosome 1
(which is the largest chromosome). We rely on the three
metrics introduced in Section 3.4. That is, we compute the
genomic privacy of each family member using the expected
estimation error in (6), the (normalized) entropy in (7), and
the (normalized) mutual information in (8) on the targeted
SNPs, and we average the result based on the number of
targeted SNPs for each individual. We rely on the L1 norm
to measure the distance between two SNP values in (6).
First, we assume that the adversary targets one family
member and tries to infer his/her SNPs by using the pub-
lished SNPs of other family members without considering
the LD between the SNPs. We select an individual from
the CEPH family and denote him as the target individual.
We construct S, the set of SNP IDs that we consider for
evaluation, from 80k SNPs on chromosome 1. Thus, the set
of targeted SNPs (XU) includes 80k SNPs of the target in-
dividual. Furthermore, we gradually ﬁll the set of observed
SNPs (XK) with the set of 80k SNPs of other family mem-
bers. That is, we sequentially reveal 80k SNPs (whose IDs
are in S) of all family members (excluding the target in-

We reveal all the 80k SNPs on chromosome 1 of other family members starting from the most distant family

dividual) beginning with the most distant family members
from the target individual (in terms of number of hops in
Fig. 4) and we keep revealing relatives until we reach his/her
closest family members.6
In Fig. 5 we show the evolution of the genomic privacy of
three target individuals from the CEPH family (in Fig. 4):
(i) grandparent (GP1), (ii) parent (P5), and (iii) child (C7).
We note that all entropy-based metrics for each target indi-
vidual start from the same values. We also observe that the
parent’s and the child’s genomic privacy decreases consid-
erably more than the grandparent’s (the adversary’s error
for the grandparent’s genome does not go below 0.3). More-
over, the observation of GP3, GP4 and P6’s genomes has no
eﬀect on GP1 and P5’s privacy as their genomes are inde-
pendent (if no other relatives’ genomes are observed). We
observe in Fig. 5(a) that the grandparent’s genomic privacy
is mostly aﬀected by the SNPs of the ﬁrst revealed children
(C7, C8), and also by those of his spouse and his child (P5).
We also observe (in Fig. 5(b)) that, by revealing all fam-
ily members’ SNPs (expect P5), the adversary can almost
reach an estimation error of 0. The target parent’s genomic
privacy signiﬁcantly decreases only with the observation of
his children’s and spouse’s SNPs. Finally, we observe in
Fig. 5(c) that C7’s genomic privacy decreases smoothly with
the observation of his grandparents’ SNPs, and then of his
siblings’. We also observe a slight decrease of privacy once
the parents’ SNPs (P5 and P6) are also revealed, but the
observation of parents (after the other children) does not
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the adversary’s error. It is im-
portant to note that the importance of a family member for
the inference power of the adversary also depends on the
sequence at which his/her SNPs are revealed in Fig. 5. For
example, in Fig. 5(c), if the SNPs of the parents (P5 and
P6) of the target child (C7) were revealed before her sib-
lings (C8-C11), then the observation of her parents would
reduce the genomic privacy of the target child more than her
siblings (but the ﬁnal genomic privacy would not change).
Next, we include the LD relationships and observe the
change in the inference power of the adversary using the LD

are revealed) is indicated for each evaluation.
values. We construct S from 100 SNPs on chromosome 1.
Among these 100 SNPs, each SNP is in LD with 5 other
SNPs on average. Furthermore, the strength of the LD (r2
value in Section 2.1.3) uniformly varies between 0.5 and 1
(where r2 = 1 represents the strongest LD relationship, as
discussed before). We note that we only use 100 SNPs for
this study as the LD values are not yet completely deﬁned
over all SNPs, and the deﬁnition of such values is still an
ongoing research. As before, we deﬁne a target individual
from the CEPH family, construct the set XU from his/her
SNPs, and sequentially reveal other family members’ SNPs
to observe the decrease in the genomic privacy of the target
individual. We observe that individuals sometimes reveal
diﬀerent parts of their genomes (e.g., diﬀerent sets of SNPs)
on the Internet. Thus, we assume that for each family mem-
ber (except for the target individual), the adversary observes
50 random SNPs from S only (instead of all the SNPs in S),
and these sets of observed SNPs are diﬀerent for each family
member. In Fig. 6, we show the evolution of genomic privacy
of three target individuals when the adversary also uses the
LD values. We observe that LD decreases genomic privacy,
especially when few individuals’ genomes are revealed. As
more family member’s genomes are observed, LD has less
impact on the genomic privacy.
We also evaluate the inference power of the adversary to
infer multiple SNPs among all family members, given a sub-
set of SNPs belonging to some family members, and also
considering the LD between SNPs. That is, we evaluate the
inference power of the adversary for diﬀerent fractions of
observed data for the family members. Using the same set
of 100 SNPs, we construct XU from (κ × 100 × n) SNPs,
randomly selected from all family members, where n is the
number of family members in the family tree (n = 11 for this
scenario), and 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1. We assume that the SNPs that
are not in XU are observed by the adversary (i.e., in XK),
and we observe the inference power of the adversary for the
SNPs in XU, for diﬀerent values of κ. In Fig. 7, we observe
an exponential decrease in the global genomic privacy (pri-
vacy of all family members), showing that the observation
of a small portion of the family’s SNPs can have a huge im-
pact on genomic privacy. The estimation error is decreased
by around 3 by observing only the ﬁrst 10% of the SNPs.

as 23andMe [2]) emerge. Furthermore, we anticipate that
the current widely used health-related OSNs (e.g., Patients-
LikeMe [6]) will let users upload and share their genomic
data. We identiﬁed 29 target individuals from 6 diﬀerent
families, whose genomic data can be inferred using the ob-
served SNPs of the identiﬁed individuals.
We focus on 2 individuals I1 and I2 out of these 6 identi-
ﬁed individuals and evaluate the genomic and health privacy
for their family members. We observed that both I1 and I2
publicly disclosed around 1 million of their SNPs. Further-
more, we identiﬁed the names of (i) 1 mother, 2 sons, 2
daughters, 1 grandchild, 1 aunt, 2 nieces, and 1 nephew of
I1, and (ii) 1 sibling, 1 aunt, 1 uncle, and 6 cousins of I2
on Facebook. We compute the genomic and health privacy
of these target individuals using the (normalized) entropy
in (7) on the targeted SNPs, and normalize the result based
on the number of targeted SNPs for each individual. We do
not use the expected estimation error in (6), as we do not
have the ground truth for the genomes of the target individ-
uals. Thus, privacy is quantiﬁed as the uncertainty of the
adversary in this section.
To quantify the genomic privacy of the target individuals
(i.e., family members of I1 and I2), we ﬁrst construct S from
all SNPs on chromosome 1 (from the observed genomes of
I1 and I2). The set of observed SNPs (XK) includes the
observed SNPs of I1 (respectively I2) for the inference of
family members of I1 (respectively I2). The set of targeted
SNPs (XU) includes 77k SNPs for I1’s family and 79k for I2’s
family (from S) for each evaluation. In Fig. 8, we show the
decrease in the genomic privacy for diﬀerent family members
of I1 (aunt, niece/nephew, grandchild, mother, child) and
I2 (cousin, aunt/uncle, sibling) as a result of our proposed
inference attack, ﬁrst without considering the LD depen-
dencies (similarly to previous section). We observe that as
expected, the decrease in the genomic privacy of close fam-
ily members is signiﬁcantly higher than that of more distant
family members. However, as we have seen in Section 4, the
observation of one (or more) additional family member(s)
has often much more impact on the target’s privacy than
the observation of only one relative.

5. EXPLOITING GENOME-SHARING WEB-
SITES AND ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS
In order to show that the proposed inference attack threat-
ens not only the Lacks family, but potentially all families,
we collected publicly available data from a genome-sharing
website and familial relationships from an OSN, and evalu-
ated the decrease in genomic and health privacy of people
due to the observation of their relatives’ genomic data.
We gathered individuals’ genomic data from OpenSNP [1],
a website on which people can publicly share sets of SNPs.
Then, we identiﬁed the owners of some gathered genomic
proﬁles by using their names and sometimes proﬁle pictures.
Among these identiﬁed individuals, we managed to ﬁnd fam-
ily relationships of 6 of them (who publicly reveal the names
of some of their relatives) on Facebook.7 We expect this
number to increase in the future, as more health-related
OSNs (which let people share their genomic proﬁles, such
7According to [28], around 12% of Facebook users publicly
share at least one family member on their proﬁles.

ability of having Alzheimer’s by the age of 80. Thus, the con-
tents of these two SNPs carry privacy-sensitive information
for individuals. We use the metrics in (9) to quantify the
health privacy of family members for Alzheimer’s disease.
We assign equal weights to both associated SNPs (as their
combination determines the predisposition to Alzheimer’s
disease).
In Fig. 10, we show the attacker’s uncertainty
about the predisposition to Alzheimer’s disease for the fam-
ily members of I1 and I2. We notice a decrease of around
0.2 (from 0.5 to 0.3) in uncertainty between close relatives.
Clearly, the knowledge of the SNPs of more relatives would
further worsen the situation.
