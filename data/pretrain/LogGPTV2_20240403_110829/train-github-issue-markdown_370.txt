So as you can see, there are some double printing artifacts here. I didn't see
them happen, but noticed them after switching to another application. I'm
running a recent OSX (10.10.1) and just installed Atom today from binary
(Version 0.175.0 (0.175.0)).
Pretty cool editor; I look forward to using it.
