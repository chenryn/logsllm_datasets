## 📝 Provide a description of the new feature
It would be nice to have a feature similar to Linux Xcompose or wincompose.
## _What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the
scenario this would be used?_
The expected behavior would be to have similar capabilities as we have with
https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose  
It's a great tool that I think should be included with powertoys.
