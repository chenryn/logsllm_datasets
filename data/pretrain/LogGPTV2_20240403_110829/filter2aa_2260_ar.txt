(including those regarding Communications Unit Leader [COML] position) was demonstrated during the 
UA’s TICP validation exercise (e.g., the COML was identified). 
Recommendation: 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance 
Usage: Advanced Implementation 
In addition to regular usage of interoperability resources for real-world responses, the Columbus UA has 
undertaken an aggressive training and exercise plan for communications.  The UA holds regular training 
exercises, including monthly exercises on the use of its gateways.  The benefit of this regular usage was 
demonstrated in the TICP validation exercise, which showed proficiency in each category of interoperable 
equipment.  For example, evaluators observed the effective set-up and activation of the gateway listed in the 
TICP.  In addition, interoperable communications was provided for regional responders above and beyond 
the core responders, including Franklin County Sheriff’s Office, Franklin County Emergency Management, 
Ohio Department of Transportation, Ohio National Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Currently, two major radio systems are used by governmental agencies in Franklin County.  Both systems are 800 MHz, 
Motorola SMARTNET II™, trunked analog radio systems.  Recent upgrades were made to dispatch consoles to 
promote and provide for “interoperability” dispatching.  The majority of the public safety agencies in the county are 
using the City of Columbus system, while many of the public service agencies are on the Franklin County system.  
These two systems provide interoperability by using common technology, allowing talk groups from both systems to 
reside on the same radio.  
The vision of the Columbus UA is first to coordinate interoperability in the Columbus area and second, to continue to 
incorporate other counties within Homeland Security Region 4 into the committee.  To foster achievement of this 
objective, the committee’s goal is to permit all of the government agencies in Region 4 to gain interoperability with any 
other agency in the area by accomplishing the following— 
• 
Establishing the ability to change talk groups on any radio 
• 
Using the statewide Multi-Agency Radio Communications System 
• 
Connecting disparate radio systems through a gateway device or via console patches at all dispatch centers 
• 
Distributing radios to other agencies to provide interoperability with local radio systems and channels.

The Governance Board, a formalized group appointed by county commissioners, has been focused on the 
Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), which has provided communications interoperability 
agreements for agencies within the county, and implementing a new countywide 800 megahertz (MHz) 
Project 25 (P25) system.  With strong support from local leaders, the new system is expected to markedly 
improve multi-agency communications within Lucas County.  Funding has been put in place to support 
implementation of the new system, and it is assumed that a newly passed 9-1-1 levy will also support 
ongoing system operation.  The Toledo UA funding strategy is considered a best practice for diversifying 
funding sources for sustainable communications interoperability funding.  Despite the partnerships involved 
in the creation of the countywide 800 MHz system, the governance group has not taken steps to ensure that 
interoperability is achieved with surrounding counties, state agencies, and additional support organizations.  
Although some long-term thinking is occurring to consider communications interoperability challenges with 
agencies outside of the UA, an overall strategic plan does not exist to facilitate regional interoperability.  
Toledo officials indicated that these strategic planning is a responsibility of the Countywide Safety 
Communication System Advisory Committee and that they hoped to address this when additional funding 
became available.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to involve state and federal organizations (e.g., state police, federal agencies operating in area) 
in the group, ensuring that their roles and responsibilities are documented within the group, and consider 
more regular participation in statewide interoperability committee efforts 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating 
agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability 
• 
Consider broadening agreements to include state, federal, and international agencies  
• 
Develop and implement a strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP), with participant 
approval, adoption, and acceptance 
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Enhance regional interoperability funding strategy and methods to include additional long-term (e.g., 3 to 
5 years) funding sources in line with interoperability goals and as documented through the strategic 
planning process 
• 
Leverage partnerships involved in regionwide system development to emphasize broadening aspects of 
interoperability (e.g., strategic planning, additional agreements among state and federal agencies)

The TICP provides the first regional communications interoperability SOPs for the Toledo UA.  Toledo 
officials indicated that policies were previously in place for computer-aided dispatch operations, but not 
voice interoperable communications.  While these interoperability SOPs are less mature, the UA has done 
well in disseminating and applying them.  Since completing the TICP, the UA has taken numerous steps to 
distribute the TICP (e.g., distributed to all included organizations and dispatch centers, distributed through 
TICP Implementation Workshop) although officials recognize that “it may take time to get everyone on 
board 100 percent.”  This statement was proven accurate during the TICP validation exercise, which noted 
some challenges with operating within the procedures established by the TICP.  With respect to 
communications requirements in the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command 
System (ICS), the Toledo UA has been implementing these procedures more than 1 year.  As noted in the 
After Action Report, the UA “can benefit from continued basic and advanced training in NIMS/ICS, 
including areas such as the rapid establishment of Unified Command, the development of Incident Action 
Plans, and appropriate ICS terminology.”  The UA has begun incorporating the communications unit into its 
command structure and indicated that this unit will participate in future training on its responsibilities. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to distribute SOPs throughout the UA, and train all participating agencies 
• 
Ensure all regional interoperability SOPs are in place, in practice, and increase proficiency in their use  
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The Toledo UA regularly uses shared channels and shared systems for day-to-day and mutual aid responses.  
It was noted in the After Action Report that the UA demonstrated familiarity with and use of interoperable 
communications equipment for effective communications (e.g., shared channels).  However, some 
deficiencies were observed.  For example, the use of radio caches created problems when the radios were 
distributed to agencies that were not trained on their use by the Communications Unit Leader.  Additionally, 
while multiple gateways were successfully used, some agencies were unable to communicate because of the 
failure to establish a console patch.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency 
(e.g., dedicated position available that understands operations and activation of the console patch) 
• 
Continue to involve additional state and federal agencies in training and exercises 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as component of all future exercises

The City of Toledo Police and the Fire and Rescue Departments use the Toledo 800 MHz trunked radio system.  The 
Lucas County Sheriff’s Office operates on an ultra high frequency (UHF) system; however, many command and control 
personnel have access to the Toledo 800 MHz system.  All other agencies within Lucas County are on various very high 
frequency and UHF systems.  Various agencies have access to the State of Ohio Multi-Agency Radio Communications 
System (MARCS) 800 MHz digital trunked radios for command and control during incidents.  All agencies within 
Lucas County will migrate to the Countywide 800 MHz Digital Communications System which is designed to meet P25 
standards, beginning in June/July 2007.  Interoperability is achieved through cached radios, gateways, and shared 
channels (on the Toledo system, and National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee and MARCS).

The Central Oklahoma Urban Area Security Initiative (COUASI) Working Group is comprised of 26 executive level 
individuals who represent more than 13 response, governance, and public safety disciplines.  The Working Group 
established the Interoperable Communications Subcommittee to create the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan 
(TICP).  The subcommittee is comprised of technical communications experts on each of the communications networks 
within the COUASI.  The Subcommittee currently includes limited local public safety organizations, but is working to 
expand membership (e.g., to include rural fire and law enforcement agencies).  Additional local, state, and federal 
participation will assist in further developing interoperable communications in the UA.  Beyond the TICP, there are 
only some formal agreements among local law enforcement and fire, and the UA is working to create additional formal 
partnerships among the remaining agencies in the area.  From the information provided, COUASI does not have a 
documented and formal strategic plan for regional communications interoperability.  Organizations appear to develop 
their budgets and procure communications equipment with consideration for regional interoperability.  However, the 
UA does not seem to have a sustainable funding plan in place for lifecycle communications system costs.  The UA’s 
leadership demonstrates an understanding of the importance of interoperable communications and is providing fiscal 
and political support (e.g., initiating sales tax funding, and mayoral representative on communications subcommittee).  
The establishment of sales taxes to support communications improvement is commendable.     
Recommendations: 
• 
Expand Interoperable Communications Subcommittee membership to include rural, state, federal, and tribal 
agencies in addition to State Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  
• 
Consider further integration of technical and operational working groups to ensure requirements are met 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., memorandum of understanding [MOU], intergovernmental agreements) 
in the TICP and store them in an accessible format 
•

The SOPs included in COUASI’s TICP represent the area’s first consensus interoperable communications plan.  The 
absence of a formal set of interoperability SOPs prior to the TICP development process indicates that public safety 
agencies in the UA have not, until recently, been conforming to a single set of SOPs, and familiarity must be less than 
optimal.  The UA is taking steps to disseminate the newly created SOPs and has plans for conducting training on them.

During the exercise, the participants experienced some procedural problems with shared channels and would benefit 
from adding region-specific policies and procedures to the TICP.  Although National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) implementation began less than 1 year ago, the participants in the TICP 
validation exercise demonstrated familiarity with the processes and only had a few minor problems (e.g., 
Communications Unit Leader [COML] designation was not officially announced, lack of communication between the 
COML and dispatch, as their procedures required).  The annual review process for the COML training requirements and 
procedures and OKOHS compliance process demonstrate the UA’s clear dedication to NIMS/ICS, which is 
commendable and recommended as a best practice. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to develop and distribute regional interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP), and put them into practice 
through regular training, exercise, and use (e.g., dispatch center and COML communications) 
• 
Consider scheduling a regular review and update process of policies and procedures 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation 
consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS

COUASI frequently uses the available means of interoperable communications (e.g., shared channels, shared systems, 
and gateways) in day-to-day activities.  During the exercise, the first responder participants were able to establish 
communications with the interoperable equipment with minimal problems (e.g., some difficulties in using shared 
channels).  Despite these demonstrated successes and although the TICP validation exercise met set standards, broader 
state and federal agencies were not widely included.  Assessing the degree to which the local agencies in the UA can 
easily use interoperable communications equipment with state and federal agencies was therefore limited.  The UA is 
encouraged to build on its success by further integrating state, federal, tribal, and support agencies in future tests.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional communications interoperability resources (e.g., emergency 
medical services [EMS] had difficulty with shared channels) to improve proficiency  
• 
Consider including additional state and federal agencies (e.g., Oklahoma Department of Transportation, FBI) in 
future exercises and day-to-day use 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as an evaluation component for all future exercises and daily 
activities

Technology Overview    
The UA has made great strides toward achieving its vision of consistent 800 MHz interoperable communications 
system.  Each city in the UA uses a radio system for its jurisdictional police, fire, and EMS agencies.  Each radio is 
configured with interoperability channels that are shared with other agencies.  No interoperable talk groups are 
identified in the TICP that are used by agencies outside of the system jurisdiction.  Cross-jurisdictional interoperability 
requires technology such as gateways or shared frequencies.  Four gateways are available but the 64-port Causeway 
Switch managed by Oklahoma City provides the greatest degree of interoperability.  National Public Safety Planning 
Advisory Committee channel usage and Emergency Operations Center coordination are minimal in this UA.  In the 
future, Oklahoma City plans to implement a crossband switch that will connect mutual aid channels. In addition, the 
State of Oklahoma has a 5-year plan to extend its Motorola 800 MHz trunked system along major highways (i.e., I35, 
I44, and I40 East).

The Portland Dispatch Center Consortium (PDCC) across and the associated Urban Area Security Initiative 
communications working group provide coordination in the area for communications interoperability issues.  
The PDCC was established by intergovernmental agreement and has been formalized through a charter for 
more than 3 years.  Some formal partnerships among participating agencies exist through memoranda of 
understanding (MOU), while other jurisdictions still operate through informal cooperation.  The five counties 
in the UA have developed strategic plans, and the Portland UA is now in the process of consolidating these 
county plans into an overarching regional strategic plan for communications interoperability.  As such, the 
UA does not have an accepted strategic plan.  The Portland UA indicated that members have come together 
to pursue a regional approach to funding; however, their interoperability priorities appear to be driven by 
available grants rather than a long-term, sustainable funding strategy.  This funding strategy, as well as 
support from local and state leaders, will be critical as key shared systems approach the end of their 
lifecycles.       
Recommendations: 
• 
Involve state and federal organizations (i.e., include applicable State of Washington agencies) in the 
decision-making group, document roles and responsibilities, and  
• 
Ensure that the UA becomes actively engaged in state communications interoperability committee efforts 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., MOUs) among all participating agencies to support 
partnerships on regional interoperable communications  
• 
Continue to develop and implement a strategic planning process (beyond the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan [TICP]), with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance 
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Encourage the development of a regional interoperability funding strategy inclusive of long-term (e.g., 3 
to 5 years) funding sources (in addition to grants) 
• 
Continue to broaden and champion a governance structure that would more fully support regional 
communications interoperability 
• 
Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official, with political and fiscal authority, to specifically 
focus on interoperable communications.
