# Title: Static Detection of Security Vulnerabilities in Scripting Languages

# Authors: Yichen Xie and Alex Aiken
## Abstract
This paper introduces a static analysis algorithm for detecting security vulnerabilities in PHP, a widely used server-side scripting language for developing web applications. Our approach utilizes a novel three-tier architecture that captures information at varying levels of granularity—within blocks, within procedures, and across procedures. This design allows us to effectively handle the dynamic features of scripting languages, which have not been adequately addressed by previous methods.

We validate our method on six popular open-source PHP codebases, identifying 105 previously unknown security vulnerabilities, most of which are believed to be remotely exploitable.

## 1. Introduction
Web-based applications have become the standard for delivering online services, ranging from discussion forums to critical areas like banking and retail. Consequently, security vulnerabilities in these applications pose significant threats to both service providers and users. Symantec reported a 670% increase in web application vulnerabilities in the second half of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 [17], a trend expected to continue.

According to the report, these vulnerabilities often result from programming errors in input validation and improper handling of user requests [17]. Traditional network-level defenses, such as firewalls, are insufficient against such attacks because vulnerabilities are deeply embedded in the program logic. Testing is also limited, as attackers exploit unexpected inputs to compromise systems.

Static analysis offers a promising alternative for detecting these errors. Previous work, such as WebSSARI [7] and Minamide's system [10], has explored this approach. However, WebSSARI, while effective in finding some vulnerabilities in PHP scripts, suffers from a high rate of false positives and negatives due to its intraprocedural type-based analysis. Minamide's system focuses on checking the syntactic correctness of HTML output from PHP scripts and is not designed to detect security vulnerabilities.

The main contribution of this paper is to show that analyzing scripting languages does not need to be significantly more challenging than analyzing conventional languages. By addressing the unique aspects of scripting languages, an appropriately designed static analysis can reliably identify many serious vulnerabilities with a high degree of automation. Given the widespread use of scripting in real-world applications, we believe there is a significant opportunity for static analysis to make a substantial impact in this domain.

In this paper, we apply static analysis to detect security vulnerabilities in PHP, one of the most widely adopted platforms for web application development. Our goal is to develop a tool that automatically identifies serious vulnerabilities with high confidence, though it does not aim to verify the absence of all bugs.

### Contributions
- We present an interprocedural static analysis algorithm for PHP, addressing the unique challenges posed by its dynamic nature, such as dynamic inclusion of code, variable type changes during execution, and operations dependent on runtime types.
- We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on six popular open-source PHP codebases, identifying 105 previously unknown security vulnerabilities, most of which are believed to be remotely exploitable.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1.2 Language Definition
Figure 3 provides the definition of a small imperative language that captures a subset of PHP constructs relevant to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The language is dynamically typed, supporting strings, booleans, and integers. Additionally, we introduce a special `>` type to represent objects whose static types are undetermined (e.g., dynamically included files or objects).

```plaintext
Const (c) ::= string | int | true | false | null
L-val (lv) ::= x | Arg#i | lv[e]
Expr (e) ::= c | lv | e binop e | unop e | (τ)e
Stmt (S) ::= lv ← e | lv ← f(e1, ..., en)
| return e | exit | include e
binop ∈ {+, -, concat, ==, !=, <, >, ...}
unop ∈ {-, ¬}
```

### 3.1.7 Block Summaries
We describe how we represent and infer block summaries, which are crucial for capturing the flow of information within and between different parts of the program. This section will detail the techniques and algorithms used to generate and utilize these summaries effectively.
