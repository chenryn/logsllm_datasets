Assistant: This log chunk shows the system configuring the hostname, copying files, setting up network connections, and enabling features such as AirDrop and Do Not Disturb. It also shows the system attempting to connect to a remote IP address and failing due to a lack of network route. Finally, it shows the system suspending and then re-enabling AWDL.
