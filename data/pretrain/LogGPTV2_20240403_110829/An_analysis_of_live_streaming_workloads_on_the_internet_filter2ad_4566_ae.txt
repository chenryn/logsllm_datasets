Figure 12: Diversity and clustering index for DailyTop40 streams: large vs. small.
Figure 12(c). The right-most line is the diversity index for large
streams, and the second line from the right is the diversity index for
small streams. Again, large streams generally have more diversity.
However, it is surprising that even small streams can have diversity,
as well. For example, 50% of small streams cover 10 countries or
more. Next, we look at the clustering index. Large streams have
very skewed clustering, as almost all large streams have a cluster
index of 10 countries or less. However, for 15% of small streams,
the clustering index is larger than 10 countries, indicating that these
small streams are more geographically (cid:147)scattered.(cid:148)
Figure 12(d) depicts the time zone diversity index. Note that
almost all large streams reach more than half of the world (13 or
more time zones). However, small streams reach a number of time
zones, uniformly distributed across the entire range. The time zone
clustering index has similar behavior to the country clustering in-
dex. For over 90% of large streams, the clustering index is 4 time
zones, whereas for 90% of small streams, the clustering index spans
8 time zones.
To understand the spacing and the distance between clientsâ€™
time zones, we look at the radius index depicted in Figure 13. The
radius index for small streams ranges from 0 (meaning 90% of
clients are in the same time zone) to more than 10 (meaning that
clients are uniformly scattered across many time zones). For 50%
of the small streams, the radius index is larger than 4, roughly span-
ning at anywhere from two continents to the entire world. Around

90th Percentile Radius Index (Number of Time Zones)

65% of large streams have a radius index of 2 or less, indicating that
90% of its clients span just 1 continent.
Next, we ask whether different event types have any impact on
the diversity. For our analysis, we classify the set of large streams
into non-stop vs. short. We then compute the same indices as dis-
cussed in the previous section. We (cid:2)nd that short streams are often

more diverse and less clustered at the granularity of AS domains
and cities. However, at larger location granularities of countries and
time zones, non-stop streams tend to be more diverse. The cluster-
ing properties for countries and time zones are similar, regardless of
event types. Due to space constraints, we omit the (cid:2)gures from the
paper.
The radius distance depicted in Figure 13 for non-stop vs. short
streams are not that different. However short streams tend to have a
larger radius index, covering more of the world.
7.5 Simultaneous Users
In the previous section, we analyzed the properties of clients
across 24-hour-long streams. The (cid:2)ndings re(cid:3)ect the total clients
who request the stream across the entire 24-hour period.
In this
section, we zoom in to (cid:2)ner timescales. We divide the streams fur-
ther into 1-hour chunks and run the same analysis across all 1-hour
chunks. This approximates clients who are accessing a stream (cid:147)si-
multaneously.(cid:148) If time-of-day effects are common, we expect to see
less diversity at smaller timescales.
Figure 14 depicts the diversity and clustering indices for coun-
try and time zone granularity. First, we note that compared to Fig-
ure 12(c), the country diversity index in Figure 14(a) is shifted to-
wards the left, indicating less diversity at smaller timescales. Sec-
ond, however, the clustering indices are only slightly different indi-
cating that the a few countries tend to dominate and the clustering
properties hold at different timescales.
The time zone diversity is also less at smaller timescales as de-
picted in Figure 14(b). The time zone clustering remains similar
compared to Figure 12(d). While time-of-day effects have signif-
icant in(cid:3)uence on the diversity index, it has little in(cid:3)uence on the
clustering of hosts.
7.6 Implications
We (cid:2)nd that many of the streams are diverse at multiple gran-
ularities. The most interesting (cid:2)nding is that there is a wide range
of diversity even for small sized streams. The high degree of diver-
sity has many implications on designing content distribution sys-
tems. One example is how should a content distribution system be
designed so that it can provide global reach, and at the same time
scale to the number of clients and the channels. Clearly, how to
place servers at the right locations in the network to reach 10,000
simultaneous users across 2,000 AS domains for one channel is a
challenge in its own right. Adding more channels, large and small,
all wanting global reach, increases the level of dif(cid:2)culty of the prob-
lem. To add another dimension, to achieve load balancing, ef(cid:2)cient
use of resources, and good performance in the face of changing dis-
tributions of clients, a dynamic mapping of clients to servers may
be required.
8. CLIENT BIRTH RATE AND LIFETIME
In this section, we look at client participation and retention. We
ask two questions:
 Are new clients tuning in to an event?
 What is the lifetime of a client?
8.1 Methodology
The data we use for this analysis is drawn from the DailyTop40
set. Our analysis is conducted on the granularity of events. We
use only data for events that are recurring, where recurring means
that the event took place at least twice across the 3-month period.
Examples of recurring events are 24-hours a day, 7-days a week
radio stations, regular daily talk shows, and sports events that take
place a few times a month.
To identify distinct users, we use the player ID (cid:2)eld in the logs.
Note that this (cid:2)eld is available only for the Windows Media for-
mat. The other two formats do not appear to support this feature
as the (cid:2)eld is either blanked or all zeros in the logs. For Windows
Media, the ID is unique unless the player has been con(cid:2)gured for
anonymity. Anonymized IDs have a well-speci(cid:2)ed pre(cid:2)x, and are
removed from the analysis. This eliminates half of the requests from
our traces. We assume that participation behavior is independent
of whether or not a user con(cid:2)gures his/her browser for anonymity.
While our analysis is conducted for only one of the streaming for-
mats, we have conducted analysis using client IP addresses (as op-
posed to player IDs) to identify unique users for the other formats.
The results appear to have similar trends. However, we do not report
them in this paper because there are several weaknesses to using IP
addresses as a unique identi(cid:2)er: (i) the presence of NATs, (cid:2)rewalls,
proxies, and DHCP could mistakenly identify multiple clients as
one user (sharing one IP address), and (ii) the use of DHCP could
mistakenly identify one client as multiple users (when assigned to
different IP addresses).

8.2 New Client Birth Rate
To understand whether new clients are tuning into the system,
we look at client birth rate, where the birth rate is de(cid:2)ned as the
ratio between the number of new distinct users that showed up that
day over the number of total distinct users for that day. Note that
new is determined relative to all the previous days in the data set.
For example, on the (cid:2)rst day, all users are newly born and the birth
rate is 100%. On the third day, only users who did not show up on
the (cid:2)rst and second day are counted as new. Figure 15(a) depicts
the average birth rate, excluding the (cid:2)rst day, for all DailyTop40
recurring events. The x-axis in the (cid:2)gure is the average birth rate.
The y-axis is the cumulative distribution of events. Note again that
an event means the aggregate of all streams that belong to the same
URL across multiple days. The birthrate varies from 10% to 100%,
