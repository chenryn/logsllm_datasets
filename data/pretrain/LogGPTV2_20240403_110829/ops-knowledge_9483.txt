User: I need to use Python 3.5 instead of 2.7. But I cannot find any 'run options' or 'interpreter configurations' in Atom. My current interpreter is Python 2.7 in '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python'. I have installed 3.5 which is in '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python'.
Besides, I am using Mac OSX.
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: Finally, find the solution. In folder of '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/', python is named as python3.5. So all I need is deleting '3.5' and use 'python' along.
