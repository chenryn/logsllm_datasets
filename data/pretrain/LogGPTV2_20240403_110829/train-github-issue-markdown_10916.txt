After upgrading from React 15.5 to React 15.6, I noticed an issue with the `RadioButtonGroup` component. Specifically, the `onChange` event handler is not being triggered when I click on a `RadioButton`.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed description of the problem:

- **React Version**: Upgraded from 15.5 to 15.6
- **Component**: `RadioButtonGroup`
- **Issue**: The `onChange` event does not fire when a `RadioButton` is clicked.

Could you please provide any guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?
