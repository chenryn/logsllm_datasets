I think the documentation for the `jax.random.gamma` random variable (sampler)
could possibly be clearer. In particular, letting the user know that the
standard form is implemented and how to incorporate the rate (or alternatively
scale) parameter in their samples. Maybe an addendum along the lines of
_"we implement the standard gamma density. Dividing the sample by the rate is
equivalent to sampling from_ $\text{Gamma}(\alpha, \text{rate})$ _. And
multiplying the sample by the scale is equivalent to sampling from_
$\text{Gamma}(\alpha, \text{scale})$."
The discussion for this started here and I'm mentioning @mattjj for
visibility. Thanks!
