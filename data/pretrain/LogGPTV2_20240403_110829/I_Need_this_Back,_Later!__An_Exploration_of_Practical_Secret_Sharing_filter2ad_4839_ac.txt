them for themselves to simplify their retrieval. In order to erect
some barrier to doing so undetectably we instructed participants to

ask condants to register their shares at a website we provided and
hosted on servers at our university. For this purpose, each share
featured (a) a shortened URL and a code number, and (b) a QR code
with the same information, ready to be scanned. Unbeknown to
participants and their condants, our website computed a nger-
print of the software and device used for registration. This allowed
us to verify with some level of condence whether the same device
was used to register multiple shares.
We used the ClientJS library1 to compute ngerprints in the
browser of the condants, specically the methods getBrowserData,
getCanvasPrint, getFonts and getMobile. Additionally, we captured
the browser’s user agent information and IP address on the server.
In order to ensure that only condants’ ngerprints are captured
we calculated ngerprints only following a valid share registra-
tion. We conducted experiments with 3 PCs and 3 smartphones
from dierent vendors over the course of four days in order to
ensure that the features we selected provided good precision (only
devices seen previously are recognized) and good recall (devices
seen previously are identied correctly). Our tests yielded perfect
recall and precision. However, see also our discussion of results and
limitations for edge cases we encountered during the study.
We regarded a participants’ distribution of shares as complete
once three out of his ve shares were registered (the minimum
necessary for successful key recovery). Completing the distribution
made participants eligible to receive the rst of two installments of
their compensation payment (e 5 of e 10).
5.1.5 Recovery Initiation. Approximately two months after a
participant received his shares for distribution the experimenter
sent an email to the participant and asked him (a) to recover the
shares, (b) to register the recovered shares, and (c) to make an
appointment with the experimenter for a debrieng. The second
registration requirement allowed us to measure the circulation time
for each share consistently (dened as the time from the rst to the
second registration). As before we collected registration ngerprints
online in order to identify deviations from the prescribed study
procedure.
5.1.6 Debriefing. We collected the recovered shares from each
participant at the beginning of each debrieng and veried them
against the registered ones. Then we asked each participant a series
of (open-ended) questions in order to collect qualitative feedback
on their experiences and potential problems encountered during
the study. Following these questions we gave participants links to
two post-debrieng online surveys and asked them (a) to answer
the rst survey and (b) to ask their condants to answer the second
survey. Participants were also given the opportunity to take the
rst survey at the end of the brieng on a PC. However, we did not
allow questions in this case because participants who preferred to
take the survey later did not have the opportunity to ask questions
either. The surveys consisted of 12 questions, see also the Appendix.
We used the LimeSurvey software2 and hosted it on computers at
our university. Finally, participants were paid their outstanding
compensation.

study, a sheet of paper (left) and a key tag (right).
5.2 Materials
5.2.1
Form Factors. We used two form factors in our eld study:
(T ) key tags with a paper label of width 36mm and height 17mm
and (P ) sheets of paper in DIN A4 format. Figure 1 shows instances
of the two form factors, which we jointly call tokens. We kept
the visual appearance of the tokens similar to limit the potential
for unanticipated and undesired eects. For this reason, we used
only the upper left corner of the paper sheet to encode the share
information. We chose white key tags because white is a bright and
neutral color (easy to see, insensitive to color blindness).
The information encoded on the tokens consisted of a URL (short-
ened for space eciency), a numeric code and a QR code. The URL
referred to the token registration website. The numeric code iden-
tied the token uniquely and was used to register the token. The
dierences between numbers were randomized in order to limit
the potential for undetected entry errors and mischief. The QR
code encoded the same information and was meant to make the
registration of tokens more convenient for participants and users
with a QR code reader. An actual implementation might use a QR
code for the bulk of the shared data (to make recovery convenient
for users) and a numeric component for quick visual identication
(for example, to tell outdated shares apart from current ones).
5.2.2 Online Surveys. We carried out three online surveys. Par-
ticipants answered a post-brieng survey and a post-debrieng
survey. We nalized the questions of the latter after the former
concluded in order to take insights from the former into account.
Condants were asked to take a voluntary post-debrieng survey
(the request was relayed by participants). We report the survey
questions in the appendix. We hosted the survey software on a
server at our university so that we could ensure the condentiality
of responses without having to rely on third-party privacy policies.
6 FIELD STUDY RESULTS & DISCUSSION
In what follows we report the measurements and observations we
made in the course of our eld study. We interpret and discuss the
outcomes in Section 9.
6.1 Participants and Condants
6.1.1 Participation. We recruited 19 participants (13 male, 6 fe-
male) of which NP = 18 completed both phases of our eld study.
One male participant dropped out (he was out of the country at the
time we concluded our study). The mean age of the participants
was 27 years (s = 6.3, median = 27.5). Each participant recruited
483

An Exploration of Practical Secret Sharing
ve condants for a total of NC = 90. Therefore, N = 108 individ-
uals were involved in our study overall. Twenty of 90 condants
answered our post-debrieng survey, 12 from group T (key tags)
and 8 from group P (paper). In one question we asked them for
their age range. The majority of condants (11 of 20) were between
18 and 29 years old. Group T is biased towards the 18-29 age range
(x = 2.3, median = 2) whereas group P is biased towards the 30-40
age range (x = 2.9, median = 3).
6.1.2 Compliance with Procedures. Based on our server logs
we analyzed the ngerprints of the clients that participants and
condants used to register their shares. We found no indication of
non-compliant behavior. We expected that ngerprints dier pair-
wise when condants register their shares, and that ngerprints are
the same for each participant when participants register the shares
they retrieved. All ngerprints diered when we expected them to
dier, and were the same when we expected them to be the same.
In three cases, we found that our server did not log ngerprints. We
investigated these cases and found that they are due to a specic QR
code reader software, ZXing.3 Said software opens decoded URLs
in a browser widget that does not enable JavaScript. Therefore,
our ngerprinting code did not run in these cases. One condant’s
share did not register in our logs. The participant who recruited the
condant relayed that the condant stated that he had registered
his share successfully. We were not able to resolve this apparent
discrepancy and counted the share as registered.
6.2 Recovery Rate
All but one participant retrieved at least three shares from his
condants during the recovery phase (enough shares to recover
the shared key). One participant retrieved only two shares. Table 2
shows the aggregate retrieval statistics of groups T and P. Figure 2
shows the distribution of retrieval rates by group. Overall, 77 of
90 shares were successfully retrieved (85.6 %). Group T retrieved
42 of 50 shares successfully (84 %) and group P retrieved 35 of 40
shares successfully (87.5 %).
Our research hypothesis does not specify a direction of dierence
between groups T and P. The recovery rate can take on ve discrete
values on an absolute scale. The minimal dierence between two
measurements is one share of ve, that is, 0.2. In order to measure an
eect it is necessary that the means of two samples dier by at least
0.2. Hence, we consider two means as equivalent if their dierence
is in the open interval ( 0.2, 0.2). The distributions appear to be
unimodal yet asymmetric and skewed to the right. Therefore, we
cannot assume a normal distribution. A Shapiro-Wilk-Test for a
normal distribution supports this observation (W = 0.78, p = 0.001
for all participants; W = 0.798, p = 0.027 for T; W = 0.791, p =
0.011 for P). A Mann-Whitney test of the two samples yields p =
0.884 and a 95% condence interval (CI) of [ 0.1999530, 0.2000192].
Since 0 is in the CI and p is not signicant we cannot reject the
null hypothesis. Therefore we cannot conclude that the form factor
has an eect on the retrieval rate. However, since the CI exceeds
the equivalence range of the mean (by a small amount at the upper
bound) we cannot conclude that the samples come from the same
distribution either.

White bars indicate group T (key tags) and yellow bars indi-
cate group P (paper sheets).
In both groups, the chances of drawing a set of condants with
one lost share is 0.5. Perhaps the number of shares should be higher
than 5 in a practical implementation in order to increase the safety
margin.
We choose a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap (bca) ap-
proach to compute a condence interval (CI) for the average number
of retrieved shares over all participants because bca CI is special-
ized for biased and skewed distribution [3–5]. The 95% bca CI is
[3.722, 4.556]. Since the CI is above three, we expect participants to
be able to recover their secrets in similar experiments in the future.
We take this as support for the conclusion that secret sharing with
physical objects is safe.
6.3 Task Durations
In what follows we report aggregate statistics of the time it took to
complete various phases of our study, see Table 3 for an overview.
The distribution phase starts when a participant receives his ve
shares. It ends when the last of the ve shares is registered by a
condant. The circulation phase lasts from the end of the previous
phase until the participant receives the request to retrieve his shares.
The retrieval phase lasts from the end of the previous phase until a
set number of shares is retrieved and registered by a participant.
We report the time until three shares were registered and the time
until the last share was registered (ve or fewer if shares were lost).
The reported times are computed over the measurements per phase
of all participants. Note that the circulation time of an individual
share may dier signicantly from the aggregate number because
a participant might distribute a specic share last but may retrieve
it rst or vice versa.
6.3.1 Distribution. Participants in both groups needed about
two weeks to distribute their shares. The mean of group P is 2-3 days
larger, that is, 17 days versus 14. The distribution times deviated by
more than a week in both groups, 9 days in group P and 8 days in
group T. Some participants needed only 6 days to distribute their
shares, others needed 30 days. Participants who needed a long time
to distribute their shares reported that their condants were slow
