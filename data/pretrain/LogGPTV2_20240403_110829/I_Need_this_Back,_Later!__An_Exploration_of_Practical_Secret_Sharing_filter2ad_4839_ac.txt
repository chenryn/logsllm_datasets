### 5.1.4 Share Registration

To prevent participants from registering shares undetectably, we instructed them to have their confidants register the shares on a website hosted on our university's servers. Each share included:
- A shortened URL and a unique code number.
- A QR code containing the same information for easy scanning.

Unknown to the participants and their confidants, the website collected a fingerprint of the software and device used for registration. This allowed us to verify with some confidence whether the same device was used to register multiple shares.

We utilized the ClientJS library to compute fingerprints in the browser, specifically using the `getBrowserData`, `getCanvasPrint`, `getFonts`, and `getMobile` methods. Additionally, we captured the browser’s user agent information and IP address on the server. Fingerprints were only calculated after a valid share registration to ensure that only confidants' fingerprints were captured.

We conducted experiments over four days with three PCs and three smartphones from different vendors to ensure that the selected features provided good precision (only devices seen previously are recognized) and recall (devices seen previously are identified correctly). Our tests yielded perfect recall and precision. However, see our discussion of results and limitations for edge cases encountered during the study.

A participant's distribution of shares was considered complete once three out of five shares were registered, which is the minimum necessary for successful key recovery. Completing the distribution made participants eligible to receive the first of two installments of their compensation payment (€5 out of €10).

### 5.1.5 Recovery Initiation

Approximately two months after receiving their shares, the experimenter sent an email to each participant, asking them to:
- Recover the shares.
- Register the recovered shares.
- Make an appointment for a debriefing.

The second registration requirement allowed us to measure the circulation time for each share consistently, defined as the time from the first to the second registration. As before, we collected registration fingerprints online to identify deviations from the prescribed study procedure.

### 5.1.6 Debriefing

At the beginning of each debriefing, we collected the recovered shares from each participant and verified them against the registered ones. We then asked participants a series of open-ended questions to gather qualitative feedback on their experiences and any potential problems encountered during the study. Following these questions, we provided participants with links to two post-debriefing online surveys and asked them to:
- Complete the first survey.
- Ask their confidants to complete the second survey.

Participants had the option to take the first survey at the end of the briefing on a PC, but we did not allow questions in this case because participants who preferred to take the survey later did not have the opportunity to ask questions. The surveys consisted of 12 questions, detailed in the Appendix. We used LimeSurvey software, hosted on computers at our university. Finally, participants received their outstanding compensation.

### 5.2 Materials

#### 5.2.1 Form Factors

We used two form factors in our field study:
- Key tags with a paper label (36mm width, 17mm height).
- Sheets of paper in DIN A4 format.

Figure 1 shows instances of the two form factors, which we collectively refer to as tokens. To limit potential unanticipated and undesired effects, we kept the visual appearance of the tokens similar. We used only the upper left corner of the paper sheet to encode the share information and chose white key tags due to their bright and neutral color (easy to see and insensitive to color blindness).

The information encoded on the tokens included:
- A shortened URL (for space efficiency).
- A unique numeric code.
- A QR code containing the same information.

The URL referred to the token registration website, and the numeric code uniquely identified the token for registration. The differences between numbers were randomized to minimize undetected entry errors and mischief. The QR code was intended to make the registration process more convenient for participants and users with a QR code reader. In an actual implementation, a QR code could be used for the bulk of the shared data, while a numeric component could be used for quick visual identification (e.g., to distinguish outdated shares from current ones).

#### 5.2.2 Online Surveys

We conducted three online surveys:
- A post-briefing survey for participants.
- A post-debriefing survey for participants.
- A voluntary post-debriefing survey for confidants (requested by participants).

We finalized the questions for the post-debriefing survey after the post-briefing survey concluded to incorporate insights from the earlier survey. The survey questions are reported in the Appendix. We hosted the survey software on a server at our university to ensure the confidentiality of responses without relying on third-party privacy policies.

### 6 Field Study Results & Discussion

In the following sections, we report the measurements and observations from our field study. We interpret and discuss the outcomes in Section 9.

#### 6.1 Participants and Confidants

##### 6.1.1 Participation

We recruited 19 participants (13 male, 6 female), of whom 18 completed both phases of our field study. One male participant dropped out (he was out of the country at the time we concluded the study). The mean age of the participants was 27 years (standard deviation = 6.3, median = 27.5). Each participant recruited five confidants, resulting in a total of 90 confidants. Therefore, 108 individuals were involved in our study overall. Twenty out of 90 confidants answered our post-debriefing survey: 12 from group T (key tags) and 8 from group P (paper). In one question, we asked them for their age range. The majority of confidants (11 out of 20) were between 18 and 29 years old. Group T was biased towards the 18-29 age range (mean = 2.3, median = 2), whereas group P was biased towards the 30-40 age range (mean = 2.9, median = 3).

##### 6.1.2 Compliance with Procedures

Based on our server logs, we analyzed the fingerprints of the clients used by participants and confidants to register their shares. We found no indication of non-compliant behavior. We expected fingerprints to differ pairwise when confidants registered their shares and to be the same for each participant when they registered the shares they retrieved. All fingerprints differed when expected and were the same when expected.

In three cases, our server did not log fingerprints. We investigated these cases and found that they were due to a specific QR code reader software, ZXing, which opens decoded URLs in a browser widget that does not enable JavaScript. Therefore, our fingerprinting code did not run in these cases. One confidant's share did not register in our logs. The participant who recruited the confidant relayed that the confidant stated they had registered the share successfully. We were unable to resolve this discrepancy and counted the share as registered.

#### 6.2 Recovery Rate

All but one participant retrieved at least three shares from their confidants during the recovery phase (enough shares to recover the shared key). One participant retrieved only two shares. Table 2 shows the aggregate retrieval statistics for groups T and P. Figure 2 shows the distribution of retrieval rates by group. Overall, 77 out of 90 shares were successfully retrieved (85.6%). Group T retrieved 42 out of 50 shares successfully (84%), and group P retrieved 35 out of 40 shares successfully (87.5%).

Our research hypothesis does not specify a direction of difference between groups T and P. The recovery rate can take on five discrete values on an absolute scale. The minimal difference between two measurements is one share out of five, or 0.2. To measure an effect, it is necessary that the means of two samples differ by at least 0.2. Hence, we consider two means as equivalent if their difference is in the open interval (-0.2, 0.2). The distributions appear to be unimodal yet asymmetric and skewed to the right. Therefore, we cannot assume a normal distribution. A Shapiro-Wilk test for normality supports this observation (W = 0.78, p = 0.001 for all participants; W = 0.798, p = 0.027 for T; W = 0.791, p = 0.011 for P). A Mann-Whitney test of the two samples yields p = 0.884 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [-0.1999530, 0.2000192]. Since 0 is in the CI and p is not significant, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the form factor has an effect on the retrieval rate. However, since the CI exceeds the equivalence range of the mean (by a small amount at the upper bound), we cannot conclude that the samples come from the same distribution either.

Table 2: Statistics of issued (out) and retrieved (in) shares by group, as well as the mean, median, and sample standard deviation of participants’ recovery rates. Both groups appear similar.

| Group | Out | In | Mean | Median | s |
|-------|-----|----|------|--------|---|
| P     | 40  | 35 | 0.875 | 0.9    | 0.149 |
| T     | 50  | 42 | 0.84  | 0.9    | 0.207 |

Figure 2: Distribution of retrieval rates by group. White bars indicate group T (key tags) and yellow bars indicate group P (paper sheets).

In both groups, the chances of drawing a set of confidants with one lost share is 0.5. Perhaps the number of shares should be higher than five in a practical implementation to increase the safety margin.

We used a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap (bca) approach to compute a confidence interval (CI) for the average number of retrieved shares over all participants because bca CI is specialized for biased and skewed distributions. The 95% bca CI is [3.722, 4.556]. Since the CI is above three, we expect participants to be able to recover their secrets in similar experiments in the future. We take this as support for the conclusion that secret sharing with physical objects is safe.

#### 6.3 Task Durations

In the following section, we report aggregate statistics of the time it took to complete various phases of our study, as shown in Table 3.

- **Distribution Phase**: Starts when a participant receives their five shares and ends when the last share is registered by a confidant.
- **Circulation Phase**: Lasts from the end of the distribution phase until the participant receives the request to retrieve their shares.
- **Retrieval Phase**: Lasts from the end of the circulation phase until a set number of shares is retrieved and registered by the participant. We report the time until three shares were registered and the time until the last share was registered (five or fewer if shares were lost).

The reported times are computed over the measurements per phase of all participants. Note that the circulation time of an individual share may differ significantly from the aggregate number because a participant might distribute a specific share last but retrieve it first, or vice versa.

##### 6.3.1 Distribution

Participants in both groups needed about two weeks to distribute their shares. The mean distribution time for group P was 2-3 days longer than for group T, with 17 days versus 14 days. The distribution times deviated by more than a week in both groups, with 9 days in group P and 8 days in group T. Some participants needed only 6 days to distribute their shares, while others needed 30 days. Participants who needed a long time to distribute their shares reported that their confidants were slow to respond.

Table 3: Task duration statistics.

| Group | Distribution (days) | Circulation (days) | Retrieval 3/5 (days) | Retrieval Max/5 (days) |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| P     | 16.88               | 39.5               | 10.88                | 12.50                  |
| T     | 14.2                | 8.3                | 10.67                | 11.30                  |
|       |                     |                    |                      |                        |
|       |                     |                    |                      |                        |
|       |                     |                    |                      |                        |
|       |                     |                    |                      |                        |
