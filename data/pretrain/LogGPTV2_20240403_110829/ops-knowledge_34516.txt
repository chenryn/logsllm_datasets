User: I'm testing my app with the development server.
When I manually interrupt a request, it sometimes clears the datastore.
This clears even models that are not modified by my request, like users, etc.
Any idea why is this?
Thanks
Assistant: The GAE development data store is only functionally equivalent to the production data store.  It's really just a file (or set of files) on your local disk simulating BigTable.  So if you abort it in the middle of doing something important, it could end up in an inconsistent state.
If you're concerned about this, you can easily back up your local data store and restore it if this happens.
