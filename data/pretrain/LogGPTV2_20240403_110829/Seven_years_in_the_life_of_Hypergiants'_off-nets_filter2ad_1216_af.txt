### The Role of Hypergiants in Future Services and Regulatory Implications

Hypergiants (HGs) play a crucial role in future services, including 5G. Their extended serving infrastructure can better handle increased traffic, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported by Google and Akamai. These deployments mean that a significant portion of traffic demand can be served locally without crossing inter-domain links or private interconnections, leading to a "zero AS-hop" Internet. This has regulatory implications, as servers located inside a network to serve only that network's users (e.g., IPTV, "private" CDN clusters) can be considered specialized services, which may not be subject to network neutrality regulations.

When ISPs allow the deployment of servers within their network, they can lose negotiation power in peering agreements with HGs, as these servers reduce the amount of traffic traversing peering interconnections. Smaller networks may see an opportunity to host such servers, reducing their upstream or downstream traffic, improving service, and reducing costs. However, HGs and ISPs must negotiate who will cover the operational costs of hosting content servers, which can be a source of dispute.

### Unintended Consequences

The widespread adoption of TLS, intended to protect users' privacy and support secure protocols, has had the unintended consequence of revealing HGs' footprints. Our study shows that it is feasible to infer HGs' off-net footprint using publicly available data. This information is important for understanding the dynamics of network traffic and shaping the Internet's topology but can also have less benign uses. Attackers can use this information to orchestrate DDoS attacks or target specific servers. Servers deployed outside HG networks may be more vulnerable to attacks due to potentially lower security measures and capacity. Authoritarian regimes can also use this information for surveillance. Additionally, competitors can use this knowledge for business intelligence, such as placing their servers strategically or inferring HGs' deployment and expansion strategies.

### Hide-and-Seek

HGs may want to hide their footprints from detection for confidentiality and security reasons. Possible approaches include:

1. **Increasing the Bar for Deployment Identification**: Using null default certificates and presenting certificates only for specific TLS-SNI requests.
2. **Restricting Requests**: Instructing off-net servers to respond only to requests from the customer cone of the hosting network.
3. **Modifying Certificate Content**: Altering fields used to infer ownership and extract fingerprints.
4. **Anonymizing Headers**: Using bot-detection to exclude headers, though this may increase diagnostic complexity.
5. **IPv6-Only Servers**: Deploying IPv6-only servers, which are invisible to IPv4 global scans but risk outages for IPv4-only clients.

Despite these approaches, our methodology, which relies on company information in TLS certificates, is expected to continue working as HGs need to provide organizational information to prove their identity.

### Conclusion

Hypergiants are responsible for a significant fraction of the traffic delivered to end users and have contributed to the consolidation and privatization of Internet infrastructure. As they expand their infrastructures, traditional measurement techniques become less effective, making it challenging to map their expansions. We developed a generic methodology to measure their expansion over seven years (2013-2021), leveraging TLS certificate scans and other active measurements. The number of ASes hosting HGs' off-nets has more than doubled, with most hosting at least one of the top-4 HGs (Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai). Growth has been particularly fast in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. This study opens new research directions on Internet privatization, content delivery, and security practices.
