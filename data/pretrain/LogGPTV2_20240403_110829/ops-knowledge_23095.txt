Question: A security analyst claims that in order to investigate a Per User Audit Policy change, it is only necessary to review the Event ID 4912 if the 'Audit Policy Change' sub-category settings are configured to log such events. Is this claim accurate, and why?
"A": "Yes, because Event ID 4912 is only logged when 'Audit Policy Change' settings are configured to log Per User Audit Policy changes.",
"B": "No, because Event ID 4912 is logged regardless of the 'Audit Policy Change' sub-category settings.",
"C": "Yes, since the 'Audit Policy Change' sub-category settings control the logging of all security-related events.",
"D": "No, because only changes to system-wide policies are logged, and per-user policies are not included in the audit logs."
Answer: B
