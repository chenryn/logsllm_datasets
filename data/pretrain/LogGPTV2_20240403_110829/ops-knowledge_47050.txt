So the problem I had was:
I installed PyDev into Eclipse Kepler using Eclipse Marketplace. Everything goes on fine and ends successfully. But PyDev doesn't show up anywhere after restart. E.g. no Python Editor, No "PyDev" in the preferences, no PyDev perspective, ... It's as if PyDev isn't installed. The only place where it shows up is in the Eclipse Maretplace where I can see it under installed tab.
Tried to reinstall (uninstall from Marketplace) via update site. Same result.
I was using Java 1.6 with Eclipse Kepler and installing latest version of PyDev 3.3.3.
No errors reported in eclipse logs.
Assistant: Debian Jessie . Eclipse Mars 4.1 .
I installed whilst my java environment was set to /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java and after the restart no reference to the PyDev install could be found other than in the installation details.
After Changing to java 1.8 ( sudo update-alternatives --config java ) and restarting eclipse all PyDev components appeared.
