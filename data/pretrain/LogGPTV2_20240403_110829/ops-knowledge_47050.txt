**Issue Description:**

I encountered an issue where PyDev did not appear in Eclipse Kepler after installation. I installed PyDev via the Eclipse Marketplace, and the installation process completed successfully. However, upon restarting Eclipse, PyDev was nowhere to be found. Specifically, there was no Python Editor, no "PyDev" section in the preferences, and no PyDev perspective. The only place where PyDev appeared was in the Eclipse Marketplace under the "Installed" tab.

I tried reinstalling PyDev by uninstalling it from the Marketplace and then installing it via the update site, but the result was the same. At the time, I was using Java 1.6 with Eclipse Kepler and had installed the latest version of PyDev (3.3.3). No errors were reported in the Eclipse logs.

**Resolution:**

A user on Debian Jessie with Eclipse Mars 4.1 reported a similar issue. They installed PyDev while their Java environment was set to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java`. After the restart, PyDev was not visible anywhere except in the installation details.

The issue was resolved by switching to Java 1.8. The user changed the Java version using the following command:
```sh
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```
After changing to Java 1.8 and restarting Eclipse, all PyDev components appeared as expected.
