For both password reuse and strength prediction, we
started with a base model without any explanatory vari-
ables, which we iteratively extended with additional pre-
dictors.
In three steps we included a) entry methods,
self-reported value, and strength; b) the number of indi-
vidually submitted passwords per participant, the creation
and storage strategy of the user; in a ﬁnal step c) the
interaction between creation strategy and detected entry
method. This approach not only allows us to evaluate the
effects of the individual explanatory variables, but also to
investigate the interplay between different storage strate-
gies and the password creation strategy. In each iteration
we computed the model ﬁt and used log likelihood model
ﬁt comparison to check whether the new, more complex
model ﬁt the data signiﬁcantly better than the previous one
(see Appendix F). As our ﬁnal model we picked the one
with the best ﬁt that was signiﬁcantly better in explaining
the empirical data than the previous models. This is a well
established procedure for model building, e.g., in social
sciences and psychological research [32, 25, 9, 15], and
allows the creation of models that have the best trade-off
of complexity, stability, and ﬁtness.
4.4.3 Zxcvbn score
For the zxcvbn score an ordinal model with all predictors
and also the mentioned interaction described our data best.
The model is presented in Table 7.

strategy (q9:generator; see Q9 in Appendix A) and the de-

tected entry methods Chrome auto-ﬁll, copy&paste, and
LastPass were signiﬁcant predictors in our model. Those
entry methods and also the creation strategy are not signif-
icant predictors of password strength on their own. This
means that using such a password management tool only
leads to signiﬁcant improvement in the password strength
when users also employ some supporting techniques (pass-
word generator) for the creation of their passwords. The
model might suggest that a general password entry with
a plugin (other than LastPass in our dataset) increased
the likelihood of a strong password. However, this could
be attributed to the high standard error resulting from the
minimal data for this entry method.
Moreover, the self-reported password strength was a
signiﬁcant predictor of the measured password strength.
This suggests that the users have a very clear view on the
strength of the passwords they have entered.
4.4.4 Password reuse
For password reuse a logistical model with all predictors
but without interactions described our data best. Table 8
presents our regression model to predict password reuse.
Reuse was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the entry method
of the password. In contrast to human entry the odds
for reuse were 2.85 time lower if the password was en-
tered with LastPass (odds ratio 0.35, predicted probability
of reuse with Lastpass = 48.35%) and even 14.29 times
lower if entered via copy&paste (odds ratio 0.07, pre-
dicted probability of reuse with copy&paste = 19.81%).
Interestingly, the input via Google Chrome auto-ﬁll even
had a negative effect on the uniqueness of the passwords.
In contrast to human entry the odds for reuse were 1.65
times higher if the password was entered with Chrome
auto-ﬁll (odds ratio 1.58, predicted probability of reuse
with Chrome auto-ﬁll = 83.72%). A further signiﬁcant
predictor of password reuse is the user’s approach to cre-
ating passwords. For users who use technical tools to
create their passwords (q9:generator), the chances that
the passwords are not reused are 3.70 times higher (odds
ratio 0.27, predicted probability of reuse if technical tools
are used = 47.36%). In contrast to the models explaining
the zxcvbn-score, our data does not indicate the presence
of an interaction effect of the password creation strategy
on the relation between entry method and password reuse.
In addition, we found a positive relation between the
numbers of passwords entered by users and their reuse. In
our model, each additional password of the user increases
the chance that it will be reused by 6% (odds ratio 1.06).
This suggests that with increasing numbers of passwords,
it becomes more likely that some of them will be reused,
which is in line with prior results [27].
We also found the self-reported website value and
password strength a statistically signiﬁcant predictor for

value for the user were less likely to be reused (odds ra-
tio of 0.87) and also passwords that the users considered
stronger were less likely to be reused (odds ratio of 0.81).
Lastly, users that reported using an analog password

likely to reuse their passwords (odds ratio of 0.62).
5 Discussion
5.1 Password Managers’ Impact
In general, our participants showed very similar password
strength and reuse characteristics as in prior studies [51,
66] and our analysis could also reafﬁrm prior results, such
as rampant password reuse.
Our study adds novel insights to the existing literature
by considering the exact password entry methods and by
painting a more complete picture by considering the users’
password creation strategies. We found that almost all
participants entered passwords with more than one entry
method. Further, we discovered that every entry method
showed reused passwords, although the ratio of reused
passwords differs signiﬁcantly between the entry methods.
More than 80% of Chrome auto-ﬁlled passwords were
reused, while only 47% of the passwords entered with
LastPass’ plugins were reused in some way, and even
only 22% of the copied/pasted passwords. Similarly, we
noticed that low-strength passwords have been entered
with all entry methods, where LastPass had on average
the strongest passwords (mean zxcvbn score of 2.80).
Interestingly, manually entered passwords and Chrome
auto-ﬁlled passwords were on a par with the overall pass-
word strength but showed above average reuse rates.
For our participants, we discovered a dichotomous dis-
tribution of self-reported creation strategies. Participants
indicated using a password generator right now or in the
214    27th USENIX Security Symposium

recent past, or clearly described mental algorithms and
similar methods for human-generated passwords. Taking
a differentiated view based on the creation strategies, we
ﬁnd that users of a password generator are closer to a
desirable situation with stronger, less reused passwords,
although being far from ideal. Only a negligible frac-
tion of participants mentioned analog tools or alternative
strategies (like two-factor authentication). Two-factor au-
thentication (2FA), in particular, might be a valuable fea-
ture for future, targeted investigations, but for our study,
we excluded 2FA since most (major) websites still lack
support for 2FA and even for services offering 2FA sup-
port the userbase has only little adapted to it [46].
Using regression modeling, we put our data together
to a more complete view of password managers’ inﬂu-
ence. Our models suggest that the interaction between
the creation strategy and the entry methods has a signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence on the password strength. If the passwords
are entered with technical support (auto-ﬁll, password
manager plugin, or copy&paste), this results in stronger
passwords under the condition that technical means were
already used when generating the passwords in the ﬁrst
place. Thus, password managers that provide users with
password creation features indeed positively inﬂuence
the overall password strength in the ecosystem. All the
more, it is curious that Chrome, as the primary tool to
access websites, has the password generation feature dis-
abled by default [7]. Future work could investigate and
compare Apple’s walled-garden ecosystem, where the Sa-
fari browser has this feature enabled by default. Another,
maybe surprising, result of our modeling is that the self-
reported password strength was a signiﬁcant predictor for
the measured password strength, suggesting that our par-
ticipants have a clear view on the strength of the entered
password. This is in contradiction to prior results of lab
studies, like [62], and we think it is worth investigating
why users in the wild are so much better at judging their
own password strength.
Our models further suggest, that the use of password
generators and the website value also signiﬁcantly re-
duced the chance of password reuse. More interestingly,
however, is that the password storage strategies have dif-
ferent inﬂuence independently of an interaction with the
creation strategy. Using a password manager plugin or
copy&pasting passwords reduced password reuse, while
Chrome’s auto-ﬁll aggravated reuse. In other words, we
observed that users were able to manually create more
unique passwords when managing their passwords digi-
tally or with a manager, but not with Chrome auto-ﬁll.
The beneﬁt of password managers is also put into bet-
ter perspective when considering particular strategies in
our GroupHuman. We noticed that users tend to have a
"self-centered" view when it comes to password unique-
ness (i.e., personal vs. global), but are unaware of the fact
that an attacker would not be concerned with personal
uniqueness of passwords. A large fraction of users re-
ported to "come up with [a password they] have never
used before" or to "try to think of something that [they]
have never used before." Those results also align with
prior studies [56, 52, 38]. While our participants were
able to correctly judge the strength of their entered pass-
words, their creation strategies indicate an incomplete un-
derstanding of uniqueness. In the future, the inﬂuence of
services like Have I Been Pwned6, which are increasingly
integrated into password creation forms and managers,
onto the users’ understanding of uniqueness and password
reuse could be studied.
Another interesting question that comes from our study
is why users of password managers (GroupPWM) still
reuse passwords and employ weak passwords. There
could be different reasons, on which we can only spec-
ulate at this point. For instance, users might employ a
default password for low-value websites, however, we
could not ﬁnd any evidence in our data set for a corre-
lation between website value and strength or reuse for
GroupPWM. Another explanation could be that those pass-
words existed prior to starting using a password manager
and were never replaced (e.g., LastPass introduced fea-
tures7 for automatically updating "legacy passwords" in
2014), or maybe those are passwords that are also required
on devices not managed by the user (e.g., computer pool
devices at the university). Thus, we think it would inter-
esting to investigate this question more focused.
Further, in light of the high relevance of copy&paste
for strong and unique passwords, our results can also
underline the "Cobra effect" [35, 36, 47] of disabling
paste functionality for password ﬁelds on websites to en-
courage the use of 2FA or password managers. Based
on our data, we consider those users who mainly use
copy&paste to enter their passwords to be a very interest-
ing subgroup that would be worth further research (e.g.,
which storage strategies are exactly pursued or motivation
to abstain from managers). Unfortunately, there were too
few copy&paste users in our current dataset to make any
further reliable statements about them separately.
In summary, password managers indeed provide bene-
ﬁts to the users’ password strength and uniqueness. Al-
though both beneﬁts can be achieved separately, our data
suggest that the integrated workﬂow of 3rd party pass-
word managers for generation and storage provides the
highest beneﬁts. More troublesome is that our results
suggest that the most widely used manager, Chrome’s
auto-ﬁlling feature, has only a positive effect on password
strength when used in conjunction with an additional gen-
erator and even shows an aggravating effect on password

reuse. The conclusion we draw from this, is that research
should investigate how such integrated workﬂows can
be brought to more users, e.g., by better understanding
and tackling the reasons why users abstain from using
password managers in the ﬁrst place.
5.2 Threats to validity
As with other human-subject and ﬁeld studies, we can-
not eliminate all threats to the validity of our study. We
targeted Google Chrome users, which had in general [6]
the highest market share, also among our survey partici-
pants. Further, we recruited only experienced US workers
on Amazon MTurk, which might not be representative
for any population or other cultures (external validity),
however, our demographics and password statistics show
alignment with prior studies. Furthermore, we collected
our data in the wild, which yields a high ecological valid-
ity and avoids common problems of password lab stud-
ies [41], but on the downside does not give control over
all variables (internal validity). We asked our participants
to behave naturally and also tried to encourage this behav-
ior through transparency, availability, and above average
payment, however, like closest related work [66, 51] we
cannot exclude that some participants behaved unusually.
6 Conclusion
Passwords are the de-facto authentication scheme on the
internet. Since users are very often referred to password
managers as a technical solution for creating guessing-
resistant, unique passwords, it is important to understand
the impact that those managers actually have on users’
passwords. Studying this impact requires in the ﬁrst place
an approach that is able to detect potential effects of man-
agers. This paper’s ﬁrst contribution is an addition to
the existing methodology, which for the ﬁrst time al-
lowed measuring the inﬂuence of managers on password
strength and reuse in the wild. By combining insights into
users’ password storage and creation strategies within situ
collected password metrics, we create a more complete
view of passwords. We applied this methodology in a
study with 170 workers from Amazon MTurk and were
able to show that password managers indeed inﬂuence
password security. More importantly, we were further
able to study factors that affect the password strength and
reuse. We found that users that rely on technical support
