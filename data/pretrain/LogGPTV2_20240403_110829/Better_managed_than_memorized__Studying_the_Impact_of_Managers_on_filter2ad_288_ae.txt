### 4.4.2 Model Building for Password Reuse and Strength Prediction

For both password reuse and strength prediction, we began with a base model that did not include any explanatory variables. We then iteratively extended this model by adding additional predictors in three steps:

1. **Initial Predictors**: We included entry methods, self-reported value, and self-reported strength.
2. **Extended Predictors**: We added the number of individually submitted passwords per participant, the user's password creation strategy, and their storage strategy.
3. **Interaction Effects**: Finally, we incorporated the interaction between the password creation strategy and the detected entry method.

This approach allowed us to evaluate the effects of individual explanatory variables and investigate the interplay between different storage strategies and password creation strategies. In each iteration, we computed the model fit and used log-likelihood model fit comparison to determine whether the new, more complex model fit the data significantly better than the previous one (see Appendix F). The final model selected was the one with the best fit that significantly outperformed the previous models in explaining the empirical data. This is a well-established procedure in social sciences and psychological research [32, 25, 9, 15], ensuring a balance between complexity, stability, and fit.

### 4.4.3 Zxcvbn Score

For the zxcvbn score, an ordinal model with all predictors, including the mentioned interaction, provided the best fit to our data. The model is presented in Table 7.

**Key Findings:**
- The interactions between the self-reported creation strategy (q9: generator; see Q9 in Appendix A) and the detected entry methods (Chrome auto-fill, copy&paste, and LastPass) were significant predictors in our model.
- These entry methods and the creation strategy alone were not significant predictors of password strength. This suggests that using a password management tool only leads to significant improvements in password strength when users also employ supporting techniques (e.g., password generators).
- The model indicates that general password entry with a plugin (other than LastPass in our dataset) increased the likelihood of a strong password, but this could be due to high standard error from minimal data for this entry method.
- Self-reported password strength was a significant predictor of the measured password strength, suggesting that users have a clear understanding of the strength of the passwords they enter.

### 4.4.4 Password Reuse

For password reuse, a logistic model with all predictors but without interactions best described our data. Table 8 presents our regression model for predicting password reuse.

**Key Findings:**
- The entry method of the password significantly influenced reuse. Compared to human entry, the odds of reuse were 2.85 times lower if the password was entered with LastPass (odds ratio 0.35, predicted probability of reuse with LastPass = 48.35%) and 14.29 times lower if entered via copy&paste (odds ratio 0.07, predicted probability of reuse with copy&paste = 19.81%).
- Interestingly, using Google Chrome auto-fill had a negative effect on password uniqueness, with the odds of reuse 1.65 times higher (odds ratio 1.58, predicted probability of reuse with Chrome auto-fill = 83.72%).
- Users who use technical tools to create passwords (q9: generator) had 3.70 times higher chances of not reusing passwords (odds ratio 0.27, predicted probability of reuse if technical tools are used = 47.36%).
- There was a positive relationship between the number of passwords entered by users and their reuse. Each additional password increased the chance of reuse by 6% (odds ratio 1.06).
- Self-reported website value and password strength were statistically significant predictors of reuse. Higher-valued websites and stronger passwords were less likely to be reused (odds ratios of 0.87 and 0.81, respectively).
- Users who reported using analog password storage (q14: analog; see Q14 in Appendix A) were less likely to reuse their passwords (odds ratio of 0.62).

### 5. Discussion

#### 5.1 Password Managers' Impact

Our participants exhibited similar password strength and reuse characteristics as in prior studies [51, 66]. Our analysis confirmed widespread password reuse and added novel insights by considering exact password entry methods and users' password creation strategies.

**Key Observations:**
- Almost all participants used more than one entry method, and every entry method showed reused passwords, though the reuse ratio varied significantly.
- Chrome auto-filled passwords had the highest reuse rate (over 80%), while LastPass plugins and copy&paste methods had much lower reuse rates (47% and 22%, respectively).
- Manually entered and Chrome auto-filled passwords had average strength but higher reuse rates.
- Participants' self-reported creation strategies were dichotomous: using a password generator or mental algorithms. Users of password generators were closer to ideal password practices, but still far from perfect.
- Regression modeling suggested that the interaction between creation strategy and entry methods significantly influences password strength. Technical support (auto-fill, password manager plugin, or copy&paste) results in stronger passwords if technical means were used during password generation.
- The self-reported password strength was a significant predictor of the measured password strength, contradicting prior lab studies and indicating that users in real-world settings are better at judging their own password strength.

**Further Insights:**
- The use of password generators and the website value significantly reduced the chance of password reuse.
- Different password storage strategies independently influenced reuse. Using a password manager plugin or copy&paste reduced reuse, while Chrome auto-fill increased it.
- Users tended to have a "self-centered" view of password uniqueness, which aligns with prior studies but indicates an incomplete understanding of global uniqueness.
- Future work should investigate the influence of services like Have I Been Pwned on users' understanding of password reuse and uniqueness.
- The reasons for password managers' users (GroupPWM) still reusing passwords and employing weak passwords need further investigation.
- The high relevance of copy&paste for strong and unique passwords highlights the "Cobra effect" of disabling paste functionality on websites. Further research is needed on users who primarily use copy&paste.

### 5.2 Threats to Validity

As with other human-subject and field studies, we cannot eliminate all threats to validity. We targeted Google Chrome users, who have the highest market share, and recruited experienced US workers on Amazon MTurk. While this may not be representative of all populations or cultures, our demographics and password statistics align with prior studies. Collecting data in the wild provides high ecological validity but lacks control over all variables. We encouraged natural behavior through transparency, availability, and above-average payment, but some participants may have behaved unusually, as in related studies [66, 51].

### 6. Conclusion

Passwords remain the primary authentication scheme on the internet. Understanding the impact of password managers on users' passwords is crucial. Our study contributes to existing methodologies by measuring the influence of password managers on password strength and reuse in the wild. By combining insights into users' password storage and creation strategies with in-situ collected password metrics, we provide a more comprehensive view of password security. Our findings show that password managers indeed influence password security, and we identified factors affecting password strength and reuse. Users who rely on technical support, such as password generators, tend to have stronger and less reused passwords, but the most widely used manager, Chromeâ€™s auto-fill feature, has mixed effects. Future research should focus on improving integrated workflows and understanding why users abstain from using password managers.
