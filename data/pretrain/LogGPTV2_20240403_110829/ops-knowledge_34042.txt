User: I'm running Windows and the shell/OS automatically runs Python based on the registry settings when you run a program on the command line. Will this break if I install a 2.x and 3.x version of Python on the same machine?
I want to play with Python 3 while still being able to run 2.x scripts on the same machine.
Assistant: As far as I know Python runs off of the commandline using the PATH variable as opposed to a registry setting.
So if you point to the correct version on your PATH you will use that. Remember to restart your command prompt to use the new PATH settings.
