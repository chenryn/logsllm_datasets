**ATT&CK ID:** C0024  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SolarWinds Compromise

During the SolarWinds compromise, APT29 employed several tactics to gain access to and exfiltrate data from victim mailboxes. Specifically, the group used the `Set-CASMailbox` command to add their own devices as allowed IDs for ActiveSync. This action enabled them to obtain copies of the victims' mailboxes. Additionally, APT29 augmented the permissions of compromised Application or Service Principals by granting them extended privileges, such as `Mail.Read` and `Mail.ReadWrite`. These enhanced permissions facilitated further access and control over the affected mailboxes.
