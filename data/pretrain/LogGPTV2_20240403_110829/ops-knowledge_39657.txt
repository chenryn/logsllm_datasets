User: I downloaded Pydev plugin for Eclipse (3.5.2) today on Mac OSX 10.5.8. To be able to use Pydev, I need to configure the interpreter in Eclipse. I am not clear what exactly I need to do here, or what this step does. I want to make sure that when I run programs from Eclipse using Pydev, it uses the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) I have installed, and can use all the packages that come with EPD. Can someone please tell me simple steps that I need to follow. 
If I click on autoconfig, it shows a bunch of folders with the path
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.Framework/Versions/2.5/...
But I know that the Python that came with EPD is version 2.6.4, so autoconfig is not choosing EPD.
Thanks for any help.

UPDATE - solution
If anyone else is interested in learning how to do this, see the first link in the answer by mlvljr below. Use the solution there EXCEPT that as suggested in the solution, Shift+Cmd+G, did not help me see inside the Python.app package. To look inside it, use the "gear" drop down menu in the Finder and choose "Show Package Contents"
Assistant: Mac OS 10.6.4:
Selecting the interpreter as /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python did not work.
I had to select /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
