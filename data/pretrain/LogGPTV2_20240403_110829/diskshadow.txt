Diskshadow
Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
Diskshadow.exe is a tool that exposes the functionality offered by the volume shadow copy Service (VSS). By default, Diskshadow uses an interactive command interpreter similar to that of Diskraid or Diskpart. Diskshadow also includes a scriptable mode.
Note
Membership in the local Administrators group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to run Diskshadow.
Syntax
For interactive mode, type the following at the command prompt to start the Diskshadow command interpreter:
diskshadow
For script mode, type the following, where script.txt is a script file containing Diskshadow commands:
diskshadow -s script.txt
Parameters
You can run the following commands in the Diskshadow command interpreter or through a script file. At a minimum, only add and create are necessary to create a shadow copy. However, this forfeits the context and option settings, will be a copy backup, and creates a shadow copy with no backup execution script.
Command
Description
set command
Sets the context, options, verbose mode, and metadata file for creating shadow copies.
load metadata command
Loads a metadata .cab file prior to importing a transportable shadow copy or loads the writer metadata in the case of a restore.

exec command
Executes a file on the local computer.
begin backup command
Starts a full backup session.
end backup command
Ends a full backup session and issues a backupcomplete event with the appropriate writer state, if needed.

Examples
This is a sample sequence of commands that will create a shadow copy for backup. It can be saved to file as script.dsh, and executed using diskshadow /s script.dsh.
diskshadow /s script.dsh
Assume the following:
You have an existing directory called c:\diskshadowdata.
Your system volume is C: and your data volume is D:.
You have a backupscript.cmd file in c:\diskshadowdata.
Your backupscript.cmd file will perform the copy of shadow data p: and q: to your backup drive.
You can enter these commands manually or script them:
#Diskshadow script file
set context persistent nowriters
set metadata c:\diskshadowdata\example.cab
set verbose on
begin backup
add volume c: alias systemvolumeshadow
add volume d: alias datavolumeshadow
create
expose %systemvolumeshadow% p:
expose %datavolumeshadow% q:
exec c:\diskshadowdata\backupscript.cmd
end backup
#End of script
