- **Concurrency Bugs Identified:** 80

#### Table 2: Bug Counts for Different Stages of Analysis
| Keyword Matches | Related | Non-Concurrency | Concurrency |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|

### 2.1 Analysis of Bug Reports

We analyzed the bug reports, which include the source code and patches, to identify and categorize the bugs. The bug reports contain various types of information that are useful for understanding the characteristics of the bugs. Specifically, they often include:
- **Description of the Bug:** Detailed information about the nature of the bug.
- **Discussion Among Developers:** Conversations and insights from developers on how to diagnose and solve the problem.
- **Status and Version Information:** Details about the status and version of the software.
- **Effects of the Bug:** Information on how the bug affects the application.
- **Reproduction Steps:** Methods to reproduce the bug, which is crucial for debugging.

The bug reports also contain additional fields such as perceived severity, which help in filtering and prioritizing the bugs. Typically, more than one patch attempt is made before a definitive patch is agreed upon.

### 2.2 Challenges in Identifying Concurrency Bugs

Concurrency bugs are often underreported, which explains why only 80 concurrency bugs were found out of a total of approximately 12,500 bugs in the database. This underreporting can be attributed to the difficulty in successfully identifying and reproducing concurrency issues.

### 2.3 Manual Analysis of Bug Reports

We manually analyzed the bug reports to gain a deeper understanding of how bugs are triggered and their effects. We focused on the following aspects:
- **Trigger Conditions:** Understanding the conditions under which the bugs are triggered.
- **Effects of the Bugs:** Analyzing the impact of the bugs on the application.
- **Complexity of Fixing Concurrency Bugs:** Estimating the complexity involved in fixing these bugs and their severity.

### 3. Overview of MySQL Characteristics

In this section, we provide a brief overview of the characteristics of MySQL that are relevant to our study.

#### 3.1 Internal Structure

MySQL is a complex codebase where the state of the server is spread across multiple data structures stored both in memory and persistently. Some of the main data structures include:
- **Data Files:** Contain the contents of the database.
- **Index Files:** Allow for fast lookups by the contents of the tables.
- **Binary Log (Binlog):** Used for backup replication and recovery operations. It logs the statements that modify the database and is essential for restoring the database state from a backup file.

#### 3.2 Concurrent Programming in MySQL

The use of concurrency in MySQL is typical of a server application. Clients issue requests to the database, which are handled by separate threads on the server side. These threads contend for access to many shared data structures, and synchronization is primarily achieved through locks and condition variables.

### 4. Results

#### 4.1 Evolution of Concurrency Bugs

We investigated the proportion of concurrency bugs in the MySQL bug database over time to determine if these bugs are becoming more prevalent. We identified the opening and closing dates of the bugs and analyzed the trends.

- **Figures 1 and 2** show the evolution of concurrency bugs by open and close dates, respectively. The results indicate a slight increase in the number and proportion of concurrency bugs over the years, but the trend is not very prominent.

#### 4.2 External Effects of Concurrency Bugs

We analyzed the external effects of concurrency bugs and categorized them into six categories. The results are presented in Table 3.

- **Table 3: External Effects of Concurrency Bugs**
  | Effect         | Number of Bugs |
  |---------------|----------------|
  | Crash         | 22             |
  | Deadlock      | 32             |
  | Error         | 7              |
  | Hang          | 6              |
  | Performance   | 5              |
  | Semantic      | 1              |

Note that the sum of all occurrences is larger than the total number of bugs because some bugs fit into more than one category. The most prevalent non-deadlock conditions are server crashes (28%) and providing wrong results (15%).

### 4.3 Discussion

- **Deadlock Bugs:** Despite the existence of sophisticated methods to address deadlocks, our study found that deadlock bugs still constitute a significant problem for the robustness of software.
- **Semantic Bugs:** These are Byzantine failures where the application provides a result that violates the intended semantics. Masking the effects of these bugs requires expensive techniques such as fault-tolerant behavior or run-time verification.

### Conclusion

This study provides insights into the prevalence and characteristics of concurrency bugs in MySQL. The analysis highlights the challenges in identifying and fixing these bugs and underscores the need for continued research and development in this area.
