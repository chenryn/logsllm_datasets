Ported from internal gates failures:
The following five tests are failing on Core editions:
    DimensionsTests::TestSetConsoleScreenBufferSize#metadataSet2
    DimensionsTests::TestSetConsoleScreenBufferSize#metadataSet1
    DimensionsTests::TestSetConsoleScreenBufferSize#metadataSet0
    DimensionsTests::TestSetConsoleWindowInfo#metadataSet0
    DimensionsTests::TestSetConsoleWindowInfo#metadataSet1
I've investigated the issue and root caused it to PR 3129098 (prior to
GitHub).
The problem is that on Core editions, the proposed font preferences and
committed font choice stored in `SCREEN_INFORMATION` do not get synchronized
with the actual font usage inside the rendering engine.
The reason this was working previously is because
`SCREEN_INFORMATION::GetScreenFontSize()` was querying the render engine
directly for the current font size.
@zadjii-msft realized that this seemed a bit silly given that
`SCREEN_INFORMATION` already had a `_currentFont` which is supposed to hold
the font selected for that screen post synchronization with the renderer. He
therefore removed the supposedly duplicate lookup and I signed off on it
thinking that it was a sensible thing to do. Turns out, it's only true on
Desktop editions.
The solutions here would be:
  1. Return `GetScreenFontSize()` to look up the font sizing information from the renderer directly
  2. Figure out why the synchronization isn't happening between `SCREEN_INFORMATION` and the active rendering engine for Core editions and make it happen again 
    * And maybe also make it harder for this to be a problem in the future by adjusting the set-up phase to fail with an error if synchronization doesn't happen prior to the first paint calls.
I prefer option 2, of course. The de-duplication was righteous; it just had a
pitfall.
