**Issue Description:**

I am attempting to use Mezzanine CMS on a shared hosting account at 1&1. I have installed Python 3.3.2, and the initial setup seems to work fine. However, when I try to create a new project using the `mezzanine-project` command, I receive the following error:

```bash
~/Mezzanine-1.4.16 > mezzanine-project blog
Traceback (most recent call last):

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**Environment Details:**
- Hosting Provider: 1&1
- Python Version: 3.3.2
- Mezzanine Version: 1.4.16

**Question:**
Do you have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue? Thank you.

**Additional Information:**
- Mezzanine 3.x is now supported, and it might be worth considering upgrading to a newer version if possible.

**Potential Solution:**

The error you are encountering is due to the use of the old `except` syntax, which is not compatible with Python 3. In Python 3, the correct syntax for catching multiple exceptions is:

```python
except (ValueError, ImportError, AttributeError) as e:
```

Instead of:

```python
except (ValueError, ImportError, AttributeError), e:
```

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

1. **Upgrade Mezzanine:**
   - Consider upgrading to a newer version of Mezzanine that is compatible with Python 3. The latest versions of Mezzanine should have fixed this syntax issue.
   - You can upgrade Mezzanine using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade mezzanine
     ```

2. **Patch the Code:**
   - If upgrading is not an option, you can manually patch the `importing.py` file in the Mezzanine package to use the correct syntax.
   - Locate the `importing.py` file and change the line:
     ```python
     except (ValueError, ImportError, AttributeError), e:
     ```
     to:
     ```python
     except (ValueError, ImportError, AttributeError) as e:
     ```

3. **Use a Virtual Environment:**
   - Ensure you are using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages and to isolate your project's dependencies.
   - You can create a virtual environment using `venv` or `virtualenv` and activate it before installing Mezzanine.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide additional details about your environment and any steps you have already taken to troubleshoot the problem.
