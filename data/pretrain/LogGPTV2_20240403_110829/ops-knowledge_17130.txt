To address your question about viewing the last run shell command via `cmd.exe` through a `HKEY_CURRENT_USER.reg` file, it is important to understand that `cmd.exe` does not store command history in the Windows Registry or in a log file by default. 

### Explanation:
- **Command History in `cmd.exe`:** 
  - `cmd.exe` does not natively save the command history. When you press the Up arrow key in the command prompt, it retrieves commands from a small, in-memory buffer. This buffer is not persistent and is cleared when the `cmd.exe` session ends.
  
- **Registry and Log Files:**
  - The `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` registry hive typically contains user-specific settings, but it does not store the command history of `cmd.exe`.
  - There are no standard log files on Windows that record `cmd.exe` command history.

### Possible Workarounds:
1. **Enable Command History Logging:**
   - You can enable command history logging by using a third-party tool or by configuring `cmd.exe` to log commands to a file. For example, you can create a batch script that logs each command to a text file before executing it.
   ```batch
   @echo off
   echo %date% %time% - %* >> C:\path\to\command_log.txt
   %*
   ```

2. **Use PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell, which is a more modern and feature-rich command-line shell, does support command history. You can view the command history in PowerShell using the `Get-History` cmdlet.
   - To view the last run command in PowerShell, you can use:
     ```powershell
     Get-History -Count 1
     ```

3. **Third-Party Tools:**
   - There are third-party tools and utilities available that can enhance `cmd.exe` with features like command history logging. Examples include ConEmu, Cmder, and others.

### Conclusion:
While `cmd.exe` itself does not provide a built-in way to view the last run command through the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` registry or any log file, you can implement workarounds to achieve this functionality. If you are working on improving your security skills, consider using PowerShell or other tools that offer more robust logging and history capabilities.
