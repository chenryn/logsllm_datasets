User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to view last run shell command via cmd.exe through a HKEY_CURRENT_USER.reg file? I'm working on improving my security skills and a challenge I have is a .reg file which is HKEY_CURRENT_USER. I need to find what the last run command on the box was.

Assistant: Not possible. cmd.exe does not save history on the registry or a log file.

Open cmd.exe and press Up. What shows up? Nothing. That's because there's no history...
