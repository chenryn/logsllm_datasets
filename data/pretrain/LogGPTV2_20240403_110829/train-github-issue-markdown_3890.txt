I'm interested in writing a typescript transform that rewrites all of the
Import declarations to named identifiers and outputs an import map. The idea
being that this could be the basis for a frontend dependency management tool
that could handle semver resolution and deduping transitive dependencies. As
far as I can tell there's no way to pass transforms via the Compiler API.
Adding the ability to do so could potentially open up a wide range of output
customizations.
Alternatively I could write a tool that does that before deno is called, but
I'd prefer the above approach because aking multiple passes at the source code
would be slower than making a single pass
