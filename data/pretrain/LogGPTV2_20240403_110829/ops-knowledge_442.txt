User: I'm running Centos7 and it comes with Python2.  I installed python3, however when I install modules with pip, python3 doesn't use them.  I can run python3 by typing python3 at the CLI 
python (2.x) is located in /usr/bin/python
python3 is located in /usr/local/bin/python3
I tried creating a link to python3 in /usr/bin/ as "python", but as expected, it didnt resolve anything. I renamed the current python to python2.bak It actually broke some command line functionality (tab to complete). I had to undo those changes to resolve.
Suggestions welcome.  Thanks.
Assistant: Do you have pip for python3, too? Try pip3 rather than pip. I assume your regular pip is just installing the modules for Python 2.x.
