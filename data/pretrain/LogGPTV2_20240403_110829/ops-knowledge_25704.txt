This log excerpt, spanning from 07:51 to 07:56 on November 11, 2008, provides a detailed account of the operations performed by the DataNode and FSNamesystem components within a distributed file system. Here is a step-by-step summary:

1. **DataNode PacketResponder Termination (07:51:14)**:
   - The `PacketResponder` for block `blk_703049809255765647` terminates.

2. **Block Reception (07:51:29, 07:51:51, 07:53:17, 07:54:08)**:
   - Multiple blocks are received by the `DataXceiver` and `PacketResponder` components.
   - Blocks `blk_-7460532841070848624`, `blk_-7623732795385061487`, `blk_7713504868233504097`, and `blk_955083461510572332` are being received from various sources.

3. **Block Allocation (07:51:58)**:
   - The `FSNamesystem` allocates a new block `blk_-7367386750462511488` for the file `/user/root/rand6/_temporary/_task_200811101024_0013_m_002009_1/part-02009`.

4. **Block Storage Updates (07:52:12, 07:53:45)**:
   - The `FSNamesystem` updates the block map, adding nodes to specific blocks.
   - Node `10.251.111.228:50010` is added to block `blk_-1237539644269634790` with a size of `67108864`.
   - Node `10.251.65.203:50010` is added to block `blk_8005746184358076390` with a size of `67108864`.

5. **Additional PacketResponder Termination (07:55:37)**:
   - The `PacketResponder` for block `blk_283922378823540530` terminates.

6. **Block Deletions (07:56:16 to 07:56:37)**:
   - The `FSNamesystem` marks several blocks as invalid and adds them to the `invalidSet` of their respective nodes.
   - Blocks `blk_4471044334742081825`, `blk_-3671953658029337449`, `blk_-75893538967225087`, `blk_805187982300776163`, `blk_4631777956354958682`, `blk_-7595375726951801956`, `blk_-4681205519208992498`, `blk_5702487846232575705`, `blk_4834069779372284635`, `blk_3735517274901501821`, and `blk_5018797996887008111` are marked as invalid and added to the `invalidSet` of their respective nodes.

In summary, this log chunk highlights the ongoing data transfer, block allocation, and block management activities within the distributed file system, including the termination of packet responders, reception of blocks, updates to the block map, and the marking of blocks as invalid.
