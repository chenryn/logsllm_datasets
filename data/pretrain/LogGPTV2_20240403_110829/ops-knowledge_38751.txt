User: This has been driving me crazy for the past 2 days.
I installed virtualenv on my Macbook using pip install virtualenv.
But when I try to create a new virtualenv using virtualenv venv, I get the error saying "virtualenv : command not found".
I used pip show virtualenv and the location of the installation is "Location: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages" but I can't figure out where the executable is. I tried dozens other similar looking posts but those solutions do not work for me.
Any ideas what might be going wrong here?
Assistant: Had the same problem on Windows. Command not found and can't find the executable in the directory given by pip show.
Fixed it by adding "C:\Users{My User}\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts" to the PATH environment variable.
