User: I'm using Django-nonrel for Google App Engine and I was wondering if it's possible to use Django's built-in mail API instead of GAE's mail API for sending mail. If it is, how do I do it?
Sorry if this seems like a noob question. I just started learning Django and GAE recently and I can't work out this problem that I have by myself.
Assistant: Yes, djangoappengine has a mail backend for GAE and it's enabled by default in your settings.py via "from djangoappengine.settings_base import *". You can take a look at the settings_base module to see all backends and default settings.
