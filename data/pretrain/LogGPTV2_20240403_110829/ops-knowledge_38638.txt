User: I am interested in developing things for google apps and android using python and java. I am new to both and was wondering if a environment set in windows or linux would be more productive for these tasks?
Assistant: Internally, I believe Google uses Eclipse running on Ubuntu for Android development, so that'd be your best bet if you're completely paranoid about avoiding all potential issues. Of course, this is impossible, and really you should just use whatever you're comfortable in.
