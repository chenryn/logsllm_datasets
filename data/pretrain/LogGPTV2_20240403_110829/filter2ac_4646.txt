title:blackhat:us-22 Do Not Trust the ASA, Trojans!
Cisco ASA and ASA-X are widely deployed firewalls that are relied upon to protect internal networks from the dangers of the outside world. This key piece of network infrastructure is an obvious point of attack, and a known target for exploitation and implantation by APT such as the Equation Group. Yet it's been a number of years since a new vulnerability has been published that can provide privileged access to the ASA or the protected internal network. But all good things must come to an end.In this talk, new vulnerabilities affecting the Cisco ASA will be presented. We'll exploit the firewall, the system's administrators, and the ASA-X FirePOWER module. The result of which should call into question the firewall's trustworthiness.The talk will focus on the practical exploitation of the ASA using these new vulnerabilities. To that end, new tooling and Metasploit modules will be presented. For IT protectors, mitigation and potential indicators of compromise will also be explored.
