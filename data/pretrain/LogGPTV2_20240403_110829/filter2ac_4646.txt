### Title: Black Hat USA 2022: Do Not Trust the ASA, Trojans!

Cisco ASA and ASA-X are widely deployed firewalls that serve as critical barriers to protect internal networks from external threats. Given their pivotal role in network security, these devices are prime targets for advanced persistent threats (APTs), such as the Equation Group. Despite this, it has been several years since a new vulnerability was discovered that could provide unauthorized access to the ASA or the protected internal network. However, this period of relative calm is about to change.

In this presentation, we will unveil new vulnerabilities affecting the Cisco ASA firewall. We will demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain privileged access to the firewall itself, compromise system administrators, and even infiltrate the ASA-X FirePOWER module. The implications of these findings should prompt a reevaluation of the trust placed in these firewalls.

The talk will focus on the practical exploitation of the ASA using these newly discovered vulnerabilities. We will present new tools and Metasploit modules designed to exploit these weaknesses. Additionally, we will discuss mitigation strategies and potential indicators of compromise to help IT professionals better protect their networks.

**Key Points:**
- **New Vulnerabilities:** Unveiling previously unknown vulnerabilities in the Cisco ASA and ASA-X.
- **Practical Exploitation:** Demonstrating how these vulnerabilities can be exploited in real-world scenarios.
- **Tooling and Modules:** Introducing new tools and Metasploit modules for ethical hacking and penetration testing.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Providing actionable steps to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities.
- **Indicators of Compromise:** Identifying signs that may indicate a breach or attempted exploitation.

This presentation aims to raise awareness about the ongoing security challenges faced by network infrastructure and to equip IT professionals with the knowledge and tools needed to enhance their defenses.
