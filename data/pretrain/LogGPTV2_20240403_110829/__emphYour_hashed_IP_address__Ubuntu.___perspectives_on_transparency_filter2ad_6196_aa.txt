## Abstract
Ad personalization has been criticized for invading privacy, lacking transparency, and offering inadequate user controls. Recently, companies have started providing web portals and other means for users to access data collected about them. In this paper, we study these new transparency tools from multiple perspectives using a mixed-methods approach. Until recently, data sharing practices remained largely unchanged, but new legislation now requires companies to grant individuals access to their stored personal data. Our study evaluates the benefits of these new rights for users. We first analyze the transparency tools provided by 22 companies to check if they meet previous recommendations for usability and user expectations. Based on these insights, we conduct a survey with 490 participants to evaluate three common approaches to disclose data. To complement this user-centric view, we also examine the design decisions and complexities of transparency in online advertising through an online survey (n = 24) and in-person interviews (n = 8) with industry experts. Our findings indicate that newly created transparency tools present a variety of information, ranging from detailed technical logs to high-level interest segment data. However, users often do not understand the data and mistrust its accuracy. At the same time, new transparency requirements pose several challenges for an industry that extensively shares data, sometimes even without being able to relate it to an individual.

## 1. Introduction
Advertisements are a crucial part of modern online services' business models, with a multi-billion dollar industry built around the placement of targeted ad banners and videos. Successful ad campaigns aim to reach audiences likely to be interested in the advertised products, defined by attributes such as location, age, and interests. Ad companies build behavioral user profiles, which include data like assumed interests, demographic information, and clickstream data, often without explicit user consent or knowledge of these mechanisms [13]. Previous studies have highlighted users' discomfort with ad personalization [36, 51] and the importance of transparency [18]. Scholars argue that transparency is essential to counter the knowledge imbalance between tracking services and individuals [26].

To address these issues, many ad-tech companies now offer ways for users to access their data via web portals (e.g., TripleLift's approach [50]) or through email requests. These tools allow users to gain insights into the data collected about them, such as the sites they were tracked on and inferred information. The increase in transparency is likely driven by new regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [47] and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) [46], which include the right of users to request access to their data (Article 15 GDPR).

Prior work on ad transparency has primarily focused on a few services offered by Facebook and Google [5]. The trend towards more transparency now extends to a larger number of services, necessitating the disclosure of more information and the provision of access to user data. This paper presents a study on the extent of new transparency mechanisms and provides insights into the challenges faced by both users and companies.

In the complex ecosystem of online advertising, effective transparency faces multiple challenges. First, data collectors must be aware of what and whose data they collect, directly or indirectly. Second, the provided data must be contextualized and presented in a way that conveys essential facts without overwhelming the user. Our study evaluates the current state of transparency tools and the data provided to users upon request. We also explore the challenges companies face in providing transparency. Our key contributions are:

- **Analysis of 22 Transparency Tools:** We evaluate the compliance of 22 online advertising companies' transparency tools with user expectations, legal norms, and other criteria. Only three tools meet the requirements described in previous work.
- **User Study (n = 490):** We conduct an online user study to better understand user needs regarding transparency in online advertising. We find that users often do not know who collects their data and struggle to understand the provided data.
- **Industry Perspective (n = 24, n = 8):** We investigate the perspective of online advertising companies through an online survey (n = 24) and in-person interviews (n = 8). Industry experts acknowledge problems with existing approaches and the inherent challenges in an ecosystem with unclear data flows.

Our analysis shows that current transparency tools do not significantly help users. It is difficult to identify who to ask for data access, and the provided data is often hard to interpret. Participants are unable to draw meaningful conclusions, as reflected in the low number of reported data access requests. Future tools need to help users better understand how their data is used, while the industry must find better ways to communicate what data they collect.

## 2. Background
Many digital services, such as websites and mobile apps, rely on revenue from displaying ads. In 2017, the online ad industry generated an estimated revenue of over €41.8 billion in Europe and $88.0 billion in the US [28, 29].

### Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA)
OBA tailors ads to individuals based on their online behavior, clickstream data, or other personal data like IP addresses. Companies collect data by tracking users across the web or using services that do so, making user tracking an essential part of the business model of web services [45]. Unique identifiers are assigned to each user, either generated by the ad company or computed based on device properties (device fingerprinting) [20]. In the mobile world, unique advertising identifiers are used to identify users, often provided by the operating system and accessible only from installed apps [56]. Users can reset these IDs or turn them off to prevent recognition [32].

### Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
Available ad space is sold on RTB platforms whenever a user visits a website. The general flow of information, as described by Yuan et al. [58], involves several entities. When a user visits a website, the site provides available ad space (inventory or impressions) to an ad exchange service, which starts auctions for the available impressions. Websites often use supply-side platforms to provide inventory. Demand-side platforms, which manage ad campaigns, place bids on the ad space based on their estimated value. The highest bid wins the impression, maximizing the ad selling price.

### Legal Background
In 2016, the European Union (EU) introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [47], which went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR specifies when personal data of EU citizens may be processed and defines the obligations of companies processing the data. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) [46] aims to strengthen privacy rights of California residents and will go into effect on January 01, 2020.

Article 15 of the GDPR describes the individual's right to access, requiring data controllers to provide users with information upon request. This includes categories of personal data processed, the purpose of processing, and the right to file a complaint with data protection authorities. Article 20 extends the access right to data portability, allowing individuals to request a copy of their collected personal data. The CCPA similarly requires businesses to disclose and deliver personal information free of charge upon a verifiable consumer request. Such requests are referred to as subject access requests (SAR).

## 3. Analysis of Transparency Tools
Some ad-tech companies have implemented ways to give individuals access to their data to address growing user demand. Notably, Google and Facebook developed privacy dashboards or transparency portals after their data collection practices came under public scrutiny [5]. Other businesses have set up information sites or web forms for data access. The number of available tools has grown due to regulatory obligations under the GDPR and CCPA, which require companies to provide access to collected personal data.

### Companies Analyzed
Previous work has shown that accessing data can be challenging and requests are not always successful [52]. To avoid the overhead of tedious and possibly unsuccessful access requests, we reviewed members of large online advertising alliances (the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)) and checked which companies offered online tools for data access. According to public statements, these alliances represent over 5,500 companies, but only 500-600 distinct members are listed on their websites. We analyzed all online tools we found and requested access to our personal data from companies that did not provide online tools but reportedly granted easy access. In total, we analyzed 22 web portals (15) and responses (7) to our subject access requests. These companies include industry giants (e.g., Google and Facebook) and medium-sized companies (e.g., Sojern and MediaMath). We differentiate between two types of data access: online (users visit a website that reads their cookie store and shows associated personal data) and offline (data provided in file formats like .csv or .pdf).

### Criteria Definition
We evaluated the transparency tools based on heuristics from multiple sources: (1) user expectations from previous studies, (2) descriptive information in privacy policies, and (3) self-regulative norms proposed by industry groups.

#### User Expectations
Previous work has shown that users have different—mostly negative—views on OBA but also demonstrate a need for transparency. Key criteria include:
- **Interest Segments/Demographics:** Users are more comfortable with OBA if they are aware of the connection between the created profile and their interests [18] (criterion C1). They also prefer personalized ads that use less sensitive data (e.g., health-related information is seen as critical) [18]. Displaying interest segments or demographic data can help users understand how their data is used and why they see specific ads [41] (criterion C2).
- **Tracking and Clickstream Data:** Users' views on online tracking range from "useful" to "scary" [51], and there is a dislike of ads based on clickstream data [37]. Disclosing the websites on which users are tracked can help them understand why certain ads are displayed, especially in cases of re-targeting [51] (criterion C3).

#### Privacy Policies
Privacy policies should be helpful to users who want to learn more about the privacy practices of ad companies. We inspected the data provided by the tools of the 22 companies and checked if the data could be grouped into the above categories, and whether the privacy policy stated that such data was collected or inferred.
