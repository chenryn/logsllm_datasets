unfolds when the frequencies of EMI signals (horizontal axis)
are plotted against time (vertical axis). In this snapshot we
observe that several devices are in continuous operation (PC,
television, and washer) while others are turning on and oﬀ
(compact ﬂuorescent lamp (CFL)).
There are several interesting features in this data, which
provide a good reference point for discussing the general
EMI signal characteristics that we observed across our many
experiments. In particular:
• Each SMPS device produces some conducted EMI, and
the presence or absence of this signal is a direct conse-
quence of the power state of the device.
3. RELATED WORK
Our work builds on and complements past work in the activ-
ity recognition, energy monitoring, and information leakage.
Activity Recognition & Energy Monitoring. Detect-
ing electrical device activity and power consumption in the
home has historically been done in the distributed sensing
model wherein each device being tracked is instrumented
with a dedicated sensor. This one-sensor-per-device model
is limiting because, as the name suggests, every monitored
device requires separate sensor installation and maintenance.
However, research dating from the 1980s in single-point sens-
ing of electrical events has focused on the design of new in-line
metering techniques for monitoring whole-house appliance
usage [11]. This early work used a current sensor installed
in-line with a home’s power meter to monitor voltage and
current waveforms from the incoming power to the home.
The methods used in these original studies combined mea-
surements of (1) step changes in power, (2) the active and
reactive power of the home, and (3) time of day statistics.
These data sources were combined to detect and classify
individual appliance usage.
Recent advances in infrastructure-mediated sensing (IMS)
from the ubicomp literature have provided an alternative
approach for detection of events on the home’s utility infras-
tructure [6, 9, 10, 22, 23]. These methods focus on leveraging
incidental signals such as the EMI from electrical appliances
and water pressure changes from plumbing ﬁxtures for in-
ferring appliance usage and thus in-home activity from a
single-point. We were inspired by this line of work and have
based our sensor architecture on the design of a power line
interface introduced in [10] to capture EMI present on a
home’s powerline. The primary focus of the existing research
on electrical sensing has been on detecting and diﬀerentiat-
ing between appliances, whether by measurements of overall
power consumption [11] or via the presence/absence of char-
acteristic signals in the EMI when analyzed in the frequency
domain [10].
To surface privacy concerns, Molina-Markham et al. re-
cently highlighted that monitoring the home’s aggregate
power consumption can reveal private information about a
homeowner’s activity [21]. This work used methods from
prior work in the energy monitoring and ubiquitous comput-
ing communities. Speciﬁcally, these authors use power usage
patterns of the on/oﬀ states of electrical device to show that
539privacy inferences are possible using seemingly innocuous
data (e.g., power activity every few hours during the night
may indicate regular feedings of a newborn).
Unlike prior work, which analyzes the state and identity of
appliances, we use a diﬀerent method to track a continuously
varying signal. If we compare the EMI acquisition sensor to a
microphone, an appropriate analogy would be that previous
work has been able to detect the presence of speech and
potentially who is speaking while our contribution enables
us to understand what is being said. Concurrent to our own
work, Clark et al. study powerline information leakage when
a PC visits a Web page [5]. They evaluated their approach
with eight websites and a single PC; their measurements
instrument the connected outlet, whereas our measurements
can take place anywhere on the powerline.
Security & Information Leakage.
In the security lit-
erature, evidence suggests that the government has long
known that ancillary EM emissions from CRT monitors leak
private information about what those devices might be dis-
playing [8, 12, 16]. Early work on studying electromagnetic
leakage from CRTs has since been extended to ﬂat-panel
displays [17] and wired and wireless keyboards [3, 28].
There are important commonalities between all these works,
e.g., they all seek to extract as much information as possible
from the observed EMI noise. There are, however, also im-
portant diﬀerences. We focus on modern LCD and Plasma
systems manufactured between 2007 and 2010. More funda-
mentally, we ﬁnd that there are inherent diﬀerences in the
types of signals we analyze. For example, both [3] and [28]
leverage EMI resulting from a keyboard’s digital transmission
of bits corresponding to key presses. Past works on CRTs/L-
CDs similarly looked at analog/digital transmissions within
the TVs [8, 12, 16, 17], however there is an additional level
of indirection in the EMI information leakage that we exploit
in this paper. Speciﬁcally, although the TV’s video content
is transmitted digitally within the TV, we do not knowingly
extract any information about that digital content. Rather,
we extract information from EMI emitted from the TV’s
power supply as it drives the video display, which consumes
varying power.
The security community has also explored numerous other
classes of information leakage, including: the time to perform
various tasks (e.g., [13]), optical emanations (e.g., [19] for
network appliances and [15] for CRTs), acoustic emanations
(e.g., for printers [4], CPUs [26], and keyboards [1]), and
reﬂections (e.g., [2]). There is also security research focused
on the modern television showing that it is possible to infer
what someone is watching over an encrypted wireless video
stream from the size of the transmitted packets [25]; that ap-
proach exploits information leakage through variable bitrate
encoding schemes, which was pioneered in [29]. Related to
power consumption, but far aﬁeld from our own work, is the
broad area of power analysis and diﬀerential power analysis
for cryptographic processors [14].
4. CONTEXT AND THREAT MODEL
This work focuses on understanding and assessing how
information might leak from a highly popular consumer elec-
tronic device: the TV. In this section we characterize the
threat models under which our results are the most applicable.
We stress, however, that (in our opinion) the results in this
paper are of scientiﬁc interest independent of any particular
threat model or policy question.
We consider three key axes for our threat model: the
type of attacker, the adversarial goals, and the adversarial
resources. We consider each in turn.
Attacker Type. We consider two key types of attackers:
• Intentional Attacker. An entity seeking to violate
the privacy of an individual; may attach an adversarial
monitoring device to the victim’s powerline.
• Unintentional “Attacker.” A party that attaches a
monitoring device to a powerline for legitimate purposes
(e.g., a smart meter or a ubicomp device). The word
“attacker” is in quotes because the party in question is
not malicious. Rather, the attached device will record
measurements from the powerline for non-malicious
purposes. The device may store those measurements
locally or transmit (a function of) those measurements
to an external server for processing and/or storage.
An intentional attacker could, for example, plug a sensor into
an exterior outlet on a neighbor’s home and thereby monitor
EMI on the neighbor’s powerline. We observe, however, that
if the attacker could enter the neighbor’s home, then the
attacker might also explore even more devious attacks, such
as hiding a webcam in a sensitive location. Thus, the most
likely intentional attacker is one that does not have direct
physical access to the monitored space (the interior of a home,
apartment, or dorm room) but that does have direct physical
access to the powerline (e.g., via an external outlet). The
device could also be disguised as a diﬀerent device, such as a
harmless power adaptor or DVD player.
A more pressing concern is likely the unintentional “at-
tacker.” Consider, for example, this scenario recounted in a
recent joint ﬁling before the State of California by the Center
for Democracy & Technology and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation [20]:
Government agents issued a subpoena to the sus-
pect’s utility to obtain energy usage records and
then used a utility-prepared “guide for estimating
appropriate power usage relative to square footage,
type of heating and accessories, and the number of
people who occupy the residence” to show that the
suspect’s power usage was “excessive” and thus
“consistent with” a marijuana-growing operation.
As smart meters and ubicomp devices begin to collect increas-
ingly ﬁne-grained measurements from the home powerline
for legitimate purposes (e.g., demand prediction, activity
recognition, green energy recommendations), it is important
to understand how those measurements could be misappro-
priated in the future.
Adversarial Goals. We consider two adversarial goals:
• Target Video Identiﬁcation. An adversary might
seek to determine whether the victim is watching a
target video.
• Target Channel Identiﬁcation. An adversary might
seek to infer what TV channel the victim is watching.
In both cases the adversary might either be an intentional
attacker or someone analyzing the data collected by an unin-
tentional “attacker.” For target video identiﬁcation, the ad-
versary may seek to determine whether the victim is viewing
a video from a “watch list” of sensitive titles, e.g., politically
540sensitive videos, religious videos, terrorist training videos.
For target channel identiﬁcation, we observe that the chan-
nel a person watches may reveal private information, e.g.,
political views, religion, known languages. The severity of
these adversarial goals may be a function of the environment
in which the victim lives. Within the U.S., we recall that
an individual’s video viewing records is considered highly
sensitive pursuant to the Video Protection Privacy Act.
Our choice of these adversarial goals is driven by scale. For
target channel identiﬁcation, the attacker may know that
a victim is watching one of a handful (a dozen or possibly
a hundred) channels. Determining which channel a person
is watching out of a small ﬁnite set of possible channels is
far more feasible than determining which video a person is
watching from the set of all possible videos. For target video
identiﬁcation, the goal is still signiﬁcantly more feasible than
determining which video a person is watching from the set
of all possible videos — rather, the adversary must only be
able to detect the viewing of speciﬁc videos.
Although we did not explore the following, we conjecture
that our approach could also be used to estimate whether an
individual is watching a pirated movie, if that pirated movie
has some (possibly slight) deviation from the authorized copy
of that movie. For example, if a pirated movie begins with
a characteristic opening sequence — e.g., the opening ani-
mation inserted by the pirating organization, or an opening
sequence that announces that the video is for the exclusive
use by members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences — then that opening sequence might reveal itself in
the leaked EMI. We explicitly did not investigate the identi-
ﬁcation of pirated content. But, as evidence of plausibility,
over the course of our experiments we did develop the capa-
bility to visually distinguish between the splash screens for
diﬀerent studios (e.g., MGM, Twentieth Century Fox, etc.).
The lack of these splash screens or the FBI warning screen
on a DVD could also be an indicator.
Finally, in addition to assuming
Adversarial Resources.
that the attacker has the ability to obtain suﬃcient quality
measurements from the victim’s powerline, we assume that
the attacker knows the type of TV that the victim is using.
Although not the focus of this paper, we consider extensions
in Section 10 where this is not necessary. Although outside
the scope of this paper, we also conjecture that a second
level classiﬁer could be designed to infer the model of TV
based on the operational characteristics of the SMPS, which
is also discussed in prior work [10]. Finally, we assume that
the attacker has access to the videos that he or she seeks to
identify (e.g., DVDs for the target videos or feeds from all
the channels that the victim might be watching).
5. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
We now turn our attention to describing the data acquisi-
tion and post-processing components we used for our experi-
ments. See Figure 2.
EMI Capture Hardware and Signal Processing. Our
system consists of three main components. First, we connect
a custom power line interface (PLI) module to any available
electrical outlet in the recording environment to gather the
conducted EMI signal. Second, we use a high-speed data ac-
quisition module to digitize the incoming analog signals from
the PLI. Lastly, we use a data collection and analysis PC
Figure 2: Components of our EMI capture hardware:
Power Line Interface (P) for ﬁltering 60 Hz signal
voltage sensing, high speed digitizer (U) for analog
to digital conversion of signals and an isolation trans-
former (I) for ﬁltering EMI from other devices in our
laboratory environment. The Sharp 42” LCD TV
and the data logging PC are also visible. We also
connect a spectrum analyzer (S) for debugging pur-
poses and for visualizing the real-time EMI signal as
a waterfall plot.
running our software to condition and process the incoming
signals from the digitizer.
Harvesting EMI. The power line interface (PLI) that we
designed to capture EMI was modeled on the circuit described
in [10] with slight modiﬁcations to increase sensitivity at a
broader frequency range. Our PLI module is essentially a
high pass ﬁlter, composed of 3 resistors and 2 capacitors
arranged as depicted in the schematic in Figure 3. This
circuit design yields a RC high-pass ﬁlter which has two
important properties. First, as in [10] it removes the 60
Hz frequency which is the rate at which alternating current
(AC) is supplied in the U.S.; if this ﬁlter is not included, the
60 Hz signal would overwhelm our capture system yielding
unusable data (and also potentially damaging any connected
low voltage hardware). Second, the ﬁlter has a ﬂat frequency
response between 6 and 30,000 kHz which allows us to capture
any conducted EMI in this expansive frequency band.
Post Processing and Automation.
To transform the
EMI data into the frequency domain, we fed the analog
signal from the PLI into a USRP (Universal Software Radio
Peripheral), which acts as a high-speed digitizer. We set the
sampling rate of the USRP to 500 kHz, which allows us to
eﬀectively analyze the spectrum from 0 to 250 kHz (under
the Nyquist Theorem). We found no interesting television
signals beyond 250 kHz.
The digitized data from the USRP is then streamed in real
time over a USB 2.0 connection to a PC running customized
GNU Radio software. The PC processes the incoming data
and computes a Blackman-Harris windowed (size half of FFT

length) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 122 times a second
to produce a vector of 2048 points which are spread uni-
formly over the spectral range (from 0 to 250 kHz). Next
we compute the squared magnitude of each FFT vector and
store the result on disk for post-processing. Our experimen-
tal infrastructure is highly automated; it can automatically
stream video content to TVs while simultaneously logging
EMI signals.
Lab vs Home Setup. Over the course of our experimen-
tal analysis we collected EMI data from lab and home settings.
During lab recordings, we connected the TV being tested
and our PLI sensor to the output of an isolation transformer
(model Tripp Lite IS500HG). The isolation transformer re-
duces electrical noise and EMI present on the power line
and presents a cleaner AC power at it’s output
. Generally,
isolation transformers are used to protect against electric
shock, or to suppress electrical noise in sensitive devices such
as high-end audio systems.

Conversely, in home recordings, we did not use the isolation
transformer but rather connected the PLI directly to any
available electrical outlet. This meant that we were no longer
guaranteed a clean electrical background, and our target EMI
could now be aﬀected by the noise produced by any of the
devices on the powerline.
6. SELECTION OF TVS AND MOVIES
To evaluate the level of EMI based information leakage
in modern TVs, we procured a set of eight TVs that diﬀer
along a number of axes including: manufacturer (Panasonic,
Samsung, Sharp), display technology (LCD or Plasma), size
