### Unfolding EMI Signal Characteristics

When the frequencies of EMI signals (horizontal axis) are plotted against time (vertical axis), a detailed snapshot emerges. In this visualization, we observe that several devices, such as a PC, television, and washer, are in continuous operation, while others, like a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), are intermittently turning on and off.

This data reveals several key features, providing a valuable reference point for discussing the general characteristics of EMI signals observed across our experiments. Notably:

- Each Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) device generates some conducted EMI. The presence or absence of this signal directly reflects the power state of the device.

### Related Work

Our research builds upon and complements previous work in activity recognition, energy monitoring, and information leakage.

#### Activity Recognition & Energy Monitoring

Historically, detecting electrical device activity and power consumption in homes has been achieved through a distributed sensing model, where each monitored device is equipped with a dedicated sensor. This one-sensor-per-device approach is limiting due to the need for separate sensor installation and maintenance for each device.

However, since the 1980s, single-point sensing of electrical events has focused on developing new in-line metering techniques to monitor whole-house appliance usage. Early studies used current sensors installed in-line with a home’s power meter to monitor voltage and current waveforms. These methods combined step changes in power, active and reactive power, and time-of-day statistics to detect and classify individual appliance usage.

Recent advances in infrastructure-mediated sensing (IMS) from the ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) literature have provided an alternative approach. These methods leverage incidental signals, such as EMI from electrical appliances and water pressure changes from plumbing fixtures, to infer appliance usage and in-home activity from a single point. Our sensor architecture is inspired by this work and is based on the power line interface introduced in [10] to capture EMI present on a home’s powerline.

The primary focus of existing research on electrical sensing has been on detecting and differentiating between appliances, either by measuring overall power consumption or by analyzing characteristic signals in the EMI frequency domain.

To highlight privacy concerns, Molina-Markham et al. [21] demonstrated that monitoring a home’s aggregate power consumption can reveal private information about homeowner activities. They used power usage patterns to show that privacy inferences are possible even from seemingly innocuous data, such as power activity during the night.

Unlike prior work, which analyzes the state and identity of appliances, we use a different method to track continuously varying signals. If we compare the EMI acquisition sensor to a microphone, previous work has been able to detect the presence of speech and potentially who is speaking, while our contribution enables us to understand what is being said. Concurrently, Clark et al. [5] studied powerline information leakage when a PC visits a web page, evaluating their approach with eight websites and a single PC, whereas our measurements can be taken anywhere on the powerline.

#### Security & Information Leakage

In the security literature, it is well-documented that ancillary EM emissions from CRT monitors can leak private information about displayed content [8, 12, 16]. Early work on electromagnetic leakage from CRTs has been extended to flat-panel displays [17] and wired and wireless keyboards [3, 28].

While these works share the common goal of extracting as much information as possible from observed EMI noise, there are important differences. We focus on modern LCD and Plasma systems manufactured between 2007 and 2010. Fundamentally, the types of signals we analyze differ. For example, [3] and [28] leverage EMI resulting from digital transmissions of key presses, while past works on CRTs/LCDs looked at analog/digital transmissions within the TVs. In our work, we extract information from EMI emitted by the TV's power supply as it drives the video display, which consumes varying power.

The security community has also explored other classes of information leakage, including task performance time, optical emanations, acoustic emanations, and reflections. Additionally, recent research has shown that it is possible to infer what someone is watching over an encrypted wireless video stream by analyzing packet sizes [25], exploiting variable bitrate encoding schemes.

### Context and Threat Model

This research focuses on understanding and assessing how information might leak from a popular consumer electronic device: the TV. We characterize the threat models under which our results are most applicable, emphasizing that the results are scientifically interesting independent of any specific threat model or policy question.

We consider three key axes for our threat model: the type of attacker, adversarial goals, and adversarial resources.

#### Attacker Type

- **Intentional Attacker:** An entity seeking to violate the privacy of an individual, possibly by attaching an adversarial monitoring device to the victim’s powerline.
- **Unintentional “Attacker”:** A party that attaches a monitoring device to a powerline for legitimate purposes (e.g., a smart meter or ubicomp device). The term "attacker" is in quotes because the party is not malicious; the device records measurements for non-malicious purposes and may store or transmit them to an external server.

An intentional attacker could, for example, plug a sensor into an exterior outlet on a neighbor’s home to monitor EMI. However, if the attacker had direct physical access to the home, more invasive attacks, such as hiding a webcam, would be possible. Therefore, the most likely intentional attacker is one with access to the powerline but not the interior of the home.

A more pressing concern is the unintentional “attacker.” For instance, a recent joint filing before the State of California by the Center for Democracy & Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation [20] described a scenario where government agents used utility records to show that a suspect’s power usage was consistent with a marijuana-growing operation. As smart meters and ubicomp devices collect increasingly fine-grained measurements, it is crucial to understand how these measurements could be misappropriated.

#### Adversarial Goals

- **Target Video Identification:** An adversary seeks to determine whether the victim is watching a target video, such as politically sensitive videos, religious videos, or terrorist training videos.
- **Target Channel Identification:** An adversary seeks to infer what TV channel the victim is watching, which may reveal private information like political views, religion, or known languages.

The severity of these goals may vary depending on the environment. In the U.S., video viewing records are considered highly sensitive under the Video Protection Privacy Act.

#### Adversarial Resources

We assume the attacker can obtain sufficient quality measurements from the victim’s powerline and knows the type of TV being used. While not the focus of this paper, we discuss potential extensions in Section 10. We also conjecture that a second-level classifier could infer the TV model based on the operational characteristics of the SMPS, as discussed in prior work [10]. Finally, we assume the attacker has access to the videos they seek to identify, such as DVDs or feeds from all channels the victim might watch.

### System Description

Our system consists of three main components for data acquisition and post-processing. See Figure 2.

#### EMI Capture Hardware and Signal Processing

1. **Power Line Interface (PLI):** We connect a custom PLI module to any available electrical outlet to gather the conducted EMI signal.
2. **High-Speed Data Acquisition Module:** This digitizes the incoming analog signals from the PLI.
3. **Data Collection and Analysis PC:** This runs software to condition and process the incoming signals from the digitizer.

#### Harvesting EMI

Our PLI, modeled on the circuit described in [10] with modifications for broader sensitivity, acts as a high-pass filter. It removes the 60 Hz frequency, which is the rate of alternating current (AC) in the U.S., and has a flat frequency response between 6 and 30,000 kHz, allowing us to capture conducted EMI in this range.

#### Post Processing and Automation

To transform the EMI data into the frequency domain, we use a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) as a high-speed digitizer, set to a sampling rate of 500 kHz. This allows us to analyze the spectrum from 0 to 250 kHz. The digitized data is streamed in real-time to a PC running customized GNU Radio software, which computes a Blackman-Harris windowed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 122 times a second, producing a vector of 2048 points. The squared magnitude of each FFT vector is stored for post-processing.

#### Lab vs. Home Setup

During lab recordings, we connected the TV and PLI sensor to an isolation transformer to reduce electrical noise and EMI. In home recordings, the PLI was connected directly to an available electrical outlet, potentially introducing background noise from other devices on the powerline.

### Selection of TVs and Movies

To evaluate EMI-based information leakage in modern TVs, we procured a set of eight TVs, differing in manufacturer (Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp), display technology (LCD or Plasma), and size (32 inches and above).

This comprehensive setup and methodology allow us to conduct detailed and robust experiments, providing insights into the potential for information leakage from modern TVs.
