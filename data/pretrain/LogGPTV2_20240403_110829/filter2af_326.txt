### 1\. Abstract
In the process of using Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab, some users lack
security awareness and do not enable the authentication function, so that any
user can directly access their own Jupyter server and view the code and
documents on their server.
We use the ZoomEye cyberspace search engine to find those Jupyter servers on
the Internet that do not enable authentication through specific search
keywords. The leaked code and documents on these servers, if exploited by
criminals, may cause data leakage and asset loss.
We recommend that all Jupyter users follow the official security
recommendations when starting the Jupyter service, and set it to log in
through token or password.
### 2\. Overview
ZoomEye [1] is a cyberspace search engine. Through the global deployment of
detection nodes, it conducts uninterrupted in-depth detection of global
Internet exposed assets, builds Internet security basic situation mapping
maps, and provides comprehensive asset basic data for security research.
Jupyter Notebook [2] is a program that opens in the form of a web page. You
can directly write and run code on the web page, and the running result of the
code will also be displayed directly under the code block. If you need to
write an instruction document during the programming process, you can write it
directly on the same page, which is convenient for explanation [3]. It is one
of the most familiar and commonly used tool for data scientists.
JupyterLab [4] is an interactive development environment, which is the next
generation of Jupyter Notebook. You can use it to write Notebook, operate
terminal, edit MarkDown text, open interactive mode, view csv files and
pictures, etc. It can be said that JupyterLab is a more mainstream development
environment for developers in the next stage [5].
In this article, we describe how to use ZoomEye to find Jupyter servers
without identity verification enabled, and access their code and documentation
through a web browser.
### 3\. Installation and startup of Jupyter
#### 3.1 Jupyter Notebook
In this chapter, we introduce how to install, startup normally, startup
Jupyter Notebook without authentication, and the effect of the corresponding
web browsing access.
For the installation method of Jupyter Notebook, refer to its official website
[6]. You only need to enter a sentence command on the command line, which is
simple and convenient.
    pip install notebook
The normal way to startup Jupyter Notebook is to enter a one-sentence command.
By default, a web service is opened on port 8888 of localhost, and a token
value for user authentication is generated.
    jupyter notebook

The token value generated when starting the Jupyter Notebook service
At this point, when you enter `http://localhost:8888` in your web browser to
access Jupyter Notebook, the page will prompt you to enter a password or
token.

① When accessing the service, the page prompts to enter a password or token
We enter the token value obtained when the command line is started on the page
to pass the authentication and use the product functions of Jupyter Notebook.
Some users need to access their Jupyter Notebook service through the Internet,
and in order to avoid the trouble of entering a password or token, they will
use the following command to expose the Jupyter Notebook service to the
Internet IP without enabling authentication.
    jupyter notebook --ip="*" --NotebookApp.token="" --NotebookApp.password=""
At this time, any user who knows the Internet IP of the Jupyter Notebook
service can enter `"http://*.*.*.*:8888"` in the web browser to access the
Jupyter Notebook service without authentication. Review the code and files on
the server. **Note that in this case, the title of the page reads: "Home Page
- Select or create a notebook".**

① The content of the page title is: Home Page - Select or create a notebook
#### 3.2 JupyterLab
In this chapter, we introduce how to install, startup JupyterLab normally,
startup JupyterLab without authentication, and the effect of the corresponding
web browsing access.
For the installation method of JupyterLab, refer to its official website [7].
You only need to enter a sentence command on the command line, which is simple
and convenient.
    pip install jupyterlab
The normal way to startup JupyterLab is to enter a command. By default, a web
service is opened on port 8888 of localhost, and a token value for user
authentication is generated.
    jupyter-lab
① The generated token value when starting the JupyterLab service
At this point, when you enter `http://localhost:8888` in the web browser to
access Jupyter Lab, the page will prompt you to enter a password or token.

① When accessing the service, the page prompts to enter a password or token
We enter the token value obtained when the command line is started on the page
to pass the authentication and use the product functions of JupyterLab.

The content of the page title is: JupyterLab
Some users need to access their JupyterLab service through the Internet, and
in order to avoid the trouble of entering a password or token, they will
expose the JupyterLab service to the Internet IP through the following
command, and do not enable authentication.
    jupyter-lab --ip="*" --NotebookApp.token="" --NotebookApp.password=""
At this time, any user who knows the Internet IP of the JupyterLab service can
enter "http:// _._. _._ :8888" in the web browser to access the JupyterLab
service without authentication, and can directly view the server code and
documentation on. **Note that the content of the page title in this case is:
"JupyterLab".**

① The content of the page title is: JupyterLab
### 4\. Find Jupyter servers without identity verification enabled
As mentioned in the previous section, the title content of the Jupyter
Notebook service without authentication is "Home Page - Select or create a
notebook", and the title content of the JupyterLab service without
authentication is "JupyterLab".
We used the following keywords to search on ZoomEye, and found the Jupyter
Notebook server IP address and port that can be directly viewed and used
without authentication, with a total of 1180 results.
    title:"Home Page - Select or create a notebook"

① Search keyword in ZoomEye：title:"Home Page - Select or create a notebook"  
② Get 1180 results
We used the following keywords to search on ZoomEye, and found the JupyterLab
server IP address and port that can be directly viewed and used without
authentication, with a total of 1597 results.
    title:"JupyterLab"

① Search keyword in ZoomEye：title:"JupyterLab"  
② Get 1597 results
### 5\. Hazards of Jupyter Serving without identity verification enabled
When the user builds the Jupyter service, the identity verification is not
enabled. Although it is convenient for daily use and does not need to enter a
password; If sensitive information such as name/password, API key/secret is
used by criminals, it may cause data leakage and asset loss.
Example 1:
As shown in the figure below, the code in the Jupyter server leaked: the key
and secret of the user API of the bitFlyer cryptocurrency exchange, the
username and password of the Gmail mailbox.
Criminals can use the key and secret of the bitFlyer cryptocurrency exchange
API to create transactions and cancel transactions on the exchange, which may
cause asset losses; use the username and password of Gmail mailboxes to log in
to Gmail mailboxes, which may cause privacy Data leakage.

① Leaked key and secret of bitFlyer cryptocurrency exchange API  
② Leaked Gmail username and password
Example 2:
As shown in the figure below, the code in the Jupyter server leaked: the
ACCESS KEY ID and SECRET ACCESS KEY of the Amazon AWS account.
Criminals can use the ACCESS KEY ID and SECRET ACCESS KEY of the Amazon AWS
account to obtain the account permissions of Amazon AWS, upload files to
Amazon S3 cloud storage space, and even create new cloud servers on Amazon
AWS.

① Leaked ACCESS KEY ID of Amazon AWS account  
② Leaked SECRET ACCESS KEY of Amazon AWS account
### 6\. Conclusion
When using Jupyter, try not to expose its web services on the Internet, but
open them for use in the local area network to avoid being accessed by
unrelated people.
If there is a need to expose Jupyter's web services to the Internet, you must
set up a token or password login instead of disabling authentication for
convenience. For specific operations, please refer to Jupyter's official
security advice blog: Please don't disable authentication in Jupyter servers
[8].
