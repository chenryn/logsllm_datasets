Abstract-  With  over  1  billion  users  connected  through  online 
social  media,  user  confidentiality  is  becoming  even  more 
important  and  is  widely  argue  in  the  media  and  researched  in 
academia. Social networking sites are a powerful and fun way to 
communicate  with  the  world.  The  Internet  is  the  safe  place  for 
only those people who aware of the risk and the security, and can 
take steps to protect themselves, so the best  solution is to learn. 
Social media is a good service because it lets you to share what 
actually  you  want  to  share,  but  it  can  also  be  used  for  negative 
purposes, and in both cases you are responsible for your security. 
Protection and preventative techniques are not very difficult, but 
you need to be careful while you are on the Internet. In this paper 
we provide a brief overview of some attire to users’ privacy. We 
classify  these  threats  as:  users’  block,  design  pitfall  and 
limitations, implicit flows of information, and clash of stimulus. 
We also describe about the privacy and security issues associated 
with social network systems.

he  level  of  human  connectivity  has  reached  extraordinary 
levels  with  over1  billion  people  using  one  or  more  online 
social  networks  including  Facebook,  Twitter,  YouTube,  and 
GoogleC. The enormous amount of data provided and shared on 
these  social  networks  may  include  the  following  information 
about a user: personal details, current address, hometown,  email 
addresses,  instant  messenger  usernames,  activities,  interests, 
favorite  sports,  favorite  teams,  favorite  athletes,  favorite  music, 
television shows, games, languages, his religious views, political 
views,  inspirations,  favorite  quotations,  service  users  history, 
education  history,  relationship  status,  family  members,  and 
software  applications.  The  user  also  provides  revise  in  the  form 
of status information or Tweets, which could include: a thought, 
an  act,  a  link  they  want  to  contribute  a  video.  All  these 
information confess a lot about the user, which will be of interest 
to various groups. 
       Social  networks,  due  to  many  such  unfavorable  incidents, 
have been blame for breaching the privacy of their users. Both in 
academia  and  in  the  media,  the  importance  of  a  user’s 
confidentiality  has  been  rarely  discussed.  In  addition  to  some 
proposed  technical  solutions,  there  have  been  a  huge  number  of 
initiatives  to  educate  users  so  that  they  do  not  provide  an 
excessive amount of personal information  
       Furthermore,  social  network  information  is  now  being 
correlated  with  users’  physical  locations,  allowing  information 
about  users’  preferences  and  social  relationships  to  interact  in 
real-time  with  their  physical  environment.  This  fusion  of  online 
social networks with real-world mobile computing has created a 
fast  growing  set  of  applications  that  have  unique  requirements 
and  unique  implications  that  are  not  yet  fully  understood.

II.  SUMMARY OF OUR WORK IN THIS PAPER 
       We  present  significant  security  and  privacy  problems  that 
are  present  in  most  existing  mobile  social  network  systems. 
Because these systems have not been designed with security and 
privacy in mind, these issues are unsurprising. The contributions 
we make in this paper are the following 
       1.  First  thing  is  regarding  the  impact  of  social  networks  in 
today’s world. 
       2. The next section deals with the privacy problem affiliated 
with  the  online  social  networking  along  with  their  security 
associated   complication. 
       3. And finally we scrutinize the design flaws and limitations 
of a social networking  systems. 
III.  IMPACT ON SOCIAL NETWORK 
       The  growth  of  social  networks  has  exploded  over  the  last 
year. In particular, usage of Facebook has spread internationally 
and to users of a  wide age range.  According to Facebook.com’s 
statistics page, the site has over 200 million active users [3] [4], 
of which over 100 million log on everyday. To compare this with 
Com Score’s global Internet usage statistics [5], this would imply 
that  nearly  1  in  10  of  all  Internet  users  log  on  to  Facebook 
everyday  and  that  the  active  Facebook  Internet  population  is 
larger than any single country’s Internet population (China is the 
largest  with  179.7  million  Internet  users  [5]).  Mobile  users  in 
particular  are  active  Facebook  users.  According  to  Facebook 
statistics (March 2009) there are currently over 30 million active 
mobile users of Facebook, and those users are almost 50% more 
active on Facebook than non-mobile users. 
        The  increasing  sophistication  of  information  technology 
with its capacity to collect, analyse and disseminate information 
is posing significant threats to social networks users privacy. It is 
now  common  wisdom  that  the  power,  capacity  and  speed  of 
information  technology  are  accelerating  rapidly.  The  extent  of

privacy  invasion  or  certainly  the  potential  to  invade  privacy 
increases  correspondingly.[6]  Many  social  networks  can  be 
broken up into many categories and most networks fall into more 
than one category [6]. The present paper is outlining the 3 most 
daily  used  social  networking  sites  giving  examples  and 
characteristics  in  order  to  understand  the  spectrum  of  the  issue 
with social network privacy.Every minute of the day:

Types of social network sites 
        Lets  have  a  brief  introduction  about  the  types  of  social 
networking sites. 
1) Social Networking Sites 
        Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, MySpace 
        Micro- blogging is similar to blogs, it is a micro journal of 
what  is  happening  right  now,  people  share  what  is  going  on  in 
their individual life or information individual wants to share.[7]. 
In  general  terms  these  sites  allow  users  to  add  friends,  send 
messages and share content. 
2. Social Media Sharing Sites 
        Photo  sharing  Instagram,  Flickr,  Photobucket,  Picasa  and  
Youtube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, MySpace and etc. 
        These  social  networking  sites  allow  users  to  easily  share 
video and photography content online. Photo sharing sites allow 
people  to  upload  photos  to  share  either  privately  with  only 
selected  other  users  or  publicly.  Creative  commons  licensing 
rights  can  grant  permissions  for  others  to  use  the  photos  by 
simply embedding the codes in their blogs [7].  
3. Location Based Networks 
        Foursquare, Gowalla, Loopt 
        Typically entered via smart phones, these applications rather 
than social networking sites feature check- in capabilities so that 
users  can,  if  they  choose,  share  their  location  with  their  social 
connections.

IV.  PRIVACY 
        On  the  Internet,  privacy,  a  major  concern  of  users,  can  be 
divided  into  these  concerns:  What  personal  information  can  be 
shared with whom Whether messages can be exchanged without 
anyone  else  seeing  them  Whether  and  how  one  can  send 
messages anonymously Personal Information Privacy Most Web 
users  want  to  understand  that  personal  information  they  share 
will not be shared with anyone else without their permission. 
        Information privacy, or data privacy (or data protection), is 
the 
and  dissemination 
of data, technology, 
the  public expectation  of  privacy,  and 
the legal and political issues  surrounding  them.  Privacy concerns

information or 
other sensitive  information is  collected  and  stored  –  in  digital 
form  or  otherwise.  Improper  or  non-existent  disclosure  control 
can be the root cause for privacy issues.

A.  Definitions of Privacy 
        There  is  no  one  recognized  definition  of  confidentiality  in 
academia  or  in  government  circles.Over  the  course  of  time 
several definitions have been gone in to. In this field we look into 
some  of  those  definitions.  One  of  the  first  definitions  of 
confidentiality,  by  Aristotle,  makes  a  distinction  between 
political activity as public and family as private [7].Implied  here 
are  barrier  that  might  be  suggested  by  the  walls  of  a  family 
house,  an  assumption  which  is  made  explicit,  though  also 
modified, in a far more recent definition, that of Associate Justice 
John  Paul  Steven  of  the  US  Supreme  Court.  Here,  the  home  is 
not  the  exclusive  locus  of  privacy,  but  is,  rather,  the  informing 
image or design in light of which privacy in other contexts may 
be  interpret.  This  is  an  interesting  definition.  The  Internet  has 
managed to dim  the boundaries that would have been suggested 
by the walls of a house.  
        However,  privacy  on  the  Internet  is  a  more  complex  affair 
than  physical  metaphors  of  intrusion  and  exposure  can  capture 
alone.  Defense  against  publication  of  private  information  can 
protect  the  exposure  of  that  information,  but  what  if  it  is  used, 
rather  to  produce  targeted  advertisements,  with  no  publication. 
William  Parent  provides  a  definition  of  privacy  which  does  not 
rest on an implicit physical dimension, as  follows [7]:Privacy is 
the  condition  of  not  having  undocumented  personal  knowledge 
about  one  possessed  by  others.  A  person’s  privacy  is  subside 
exactly  to the degree that others possess this  kind of knowledge 
about him.
