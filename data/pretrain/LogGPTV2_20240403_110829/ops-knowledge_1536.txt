User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: I wanted to add a common problem that happens on installation. It is possible that the path installation length is too long. To avoid this change the standard path so that it is shorter than 250 characters. 
I realized this when I installed the software and did a custom installation, on a WIN10 operation system. In the custom install, it should be possible to have Python added as PATH variable by the software
