Hi, I am observing that `deno bundle` does not bundle imports that have the
`@deno-types` annotation. This may be related to #5665.
    // @deno-types="https://unpkg.com/rollup@2.16.0/dist/rollup.d.ts"
    import { rollup } from 'https://unpkg.com/rollup@2.16.0/dist/es/rollup.browser.js'
    console.log(rollup)
`deno bundle test.js > out.js && deno run out.js`
    error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'rollup' of undefined
                console.log(rollup_browser_js_1.rollup);
If I omit the `@deno-types` annotation, the `out.js` file is significantly
larger and it works fine.
