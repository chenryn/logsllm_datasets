Abstract
In recent years, ride-hailing services (RHSs) have be-
come increasingly popular, serving millions of users per
day. Such systems, however, raise signiﬁcant privacy
concerns, because service providers are able to track the
precise mobility patterns of all riders and drivers. In this
paper, we propose ORide (Oblivious Ride), a privacy-
preserving RHS based on somewhat-homomorphic en-
cryption with optimizations such as ciphertext packing
and transformed processing. With ORide, a service
provider can match riders and drivers without learning
their identities or location information. ORide offers rid-
ers with fairly large anonymity sets (e.g., several thou-
sands), even in sparsely populated areas.
In addition,
ORide supports key RHS features such as easy payment,
reputation scores, accountability, and retrieval of lost
items. Using real data-sets that consist of millions of
rides, we show that the computational and network over-
head introduced by ORide is acceptable. For example,
ORide adds only several milliseconds to ride-hailing op-
erations, and the extra driving distance for a driver is less
than 0.5 km in more than 75% of the cases evaluated. In
short, we show that a RHS can offer strong privacy guar-
antees to both riders and drivers while maintaining the
convenience of its services.

Ride-hailing services (RHSs), such as Uber and Lyft, en-
able millions of riders and drivers worldwide to set up
rides via their smartphones. Their advantage over tra-
ditional taxi services is due to the convenience of their
services, e.g., ride requests at the touch of a button,
fare estimation, automatic payments, and reputation rat-
ings. Moreover, the accountability provided by RHSs
is a key feature for riders and drivers, as it make them
feel safer [11, 15]. For instance, in case of a criminal in-
vestigation, the RHS provider can offer law-enforcement
agencies with the location trace of a particular ride and
the identities of the participants.
Introduction
To offer such services, however, RHSs collect a vast
amount of sensitive information that puts at risk the pri-
vacy of riders and drivers. First, for each ride, the loca-
tion traces and rider’s and driver’s identities are known
to the service provider (SP). As a result, the SP, or
any entity with access to this data, can infer sensitive
information about riders’ activities (such as one-night
stands [35]), monitor the locations of riders in real-time
for entertainment [18], track the whereabouts of their ex-
lovers [42], look up trip information of celebrities [25],
and even mount revenge attacks against journalists criti-
cal of such services [46]. In the case of drivers, there are
reports of SPs that track drivers to ﬁnd if the drivers at-
tended protests [1]. Second, due to the release of drivers’
personal identiﬁable information (PII) early in the ride
set-up procedure, an outsider adversary can massively
collect drivers’ PII [39]. Third, there is evidence that
RHS drivers and riders are discriminated based on the
racial and/or gender information speciﬁed in their pro-
ﬁles [20]. Hence, there is a strong need to provide pri-
vacy and anonymity for both riders and drivers w.r.t. the
SP and each other.
To the best of our knowledge,
the only privacy-
friendly alternative to current RHSs is PrivateRide, pro-
posed by us [39]. However, this work has some limita-
tions, i.e., it does not provide strong privacy guarantees
for riders, and offers less accountability and usability,
compared to the current RHSs (see Section 2). Therefore,
a mechanism with more robust privacy and accountabil-
ity guarantees is needed.
We present ORide, a privacy-preserving RHS in-
spired by PrivateRide; it reuses only one operation from
PrivateRide, i.e., the proximity check to prevent drivers’
PII from being harvested (see Section 5.4). ORide en-
ables the SP to efﬁciently match riders and drivers with-
out leaking either their identities or their locations, while
providing accountability to deter misbehavior. ORide
provides strong privacy for both riders and drivers,
i.e., all users in the system are part of large anonymity

sets, even if they are in sparsely populated areas. Even
in the extreme case of targeted attacks (i.e., a curious SP
wants to know the destination of a speciﬁc rider given the
time and location of her pick-up event [33]), the location
privacy of the rider’s destination is still guaranteed. For
this purpose, ORide relies on state-of-the-art somewhat-
homomorphic encryption system [16] (SHE), to which
we apply optimizations for ciphertext packing and trans-
formed processing [38], hence enabling a notable boost
in performance and a reduction in overhead w.r.t. naive
cryptographic solutions.
Accountability and usability are often considered as
important as privacy in RHSs [11, 15]; this introduces
challenges in resolving the uneasy tension between pri-
vacy, accountability and usability. To achieve account-
able privacy, ORide enables the SP to revoke, when
needed, the anonymity of misbehaving riders or drivers.
However, the SP does not have full control over this re-
identiﬁcation operation, i.e., it is able to do it only with
the support from the affected party. In addition, to pre-
serve the convenience of the service, ORide supports au-
tomatic payment through credit cards and enables riders
to contact drivers for lost items. ORide also preserves the
reputation-rating operations of current RHSs.
The evaluation of ORide by using real data-sets from
NYC taxi cabs [44] shows that, even with strong bit-
security of more than 112 bits, ORide introduces ac-
ceptable computational and bandwidth costs for riders,
drivers and the SP. For example, for each ride request,
a rider needs to download only one ciphertext of size
186 KB with a computational overhead of less than ten
milliseconds. ORide also provides large anonymity sets
for riders at the cost of acceptable bandwidth require-
ments for the drivers: e.g., for rides in the boroughs of
Queens and Bronx, a ride would have an anonymity set
of about 26,000, and the drivers are only required to have
a data-connection speed of less than 2 Mbps. Moreover,
our results show that ORide is scalable, as we considered
a request load that is signiﬁcantly higher than the one in
current RHSs, e.g., Uber accounts for only 15% of the
ride pick-up requests in NYC [43].
In summary, we make the following contributions:
• A novel, oblivious, and efﬁcient ride-matching mech-
anism. ORide includes a novel protocol based on
quantum-resistant SHE to match riders and drivers,
without revealing their identities and locations to the
SP. We optimize our SHE-based protocol to consider-
ably reduce the bandwidth requirements and the pro-
cessing overhead, compared to a vanilla SHE-based
protocol; and we propose an efﬁcient extension to deal
with malicious drivers.
• The design and prototype of ORide. ORide supports the
matching of riders and drivers, different accountability
mechanisms, and it reduces the amount of sensitive in-
formation revealed to the SP. In particular, ORide sup-
ports functionalities that are often considered also as
important as privacy, such as credit-card payment, repu-
tation rating, contacting drivers in case of lost items and
traceability in case of criminal activity during a ride.
• Thorough performance evaluation. Using real data-sets
and robust security parameters (i.e., 112 bits security),
we show that ORide provides strong privacy guarantees
for riders and drivers. In addition, the computational
and network overhead introduced by ORide is practical
for riders, drivers and SP. We also show that ORide has
a negligible effect on the accuracy of matching riders
and drivers compared with current RHSs. The source
code of our evaluation is available at [36].
2 Related Work
Researchers have proposed different privacy-enhancing
solutions for ride sharing (i.e., car pooling) services [6,
14, 21, 22, 40] and public transportation ticketing sys-
tems [8, 26, 31]. However, little work exists in the area
of privacy and security for RHSs, probably due to their
relative novelty. According to our literature review, the
most relevant work in this area is PrivateRide [39].
PrivateRide is the ﬁrst system to enhance location pri-
vacy for riders and protect drivers’ information from har-
vesting attacks while maintaining the convenience of the
service. However, it has several limitations that are ad-
dressed in this work. First, PrivateRide cannot guaran-
tee the same level of privacy to all riders, because the
size of the anonymity set in a particular cloaked area
depends on the density of riders in that area. For in-
stance, the anonymity set is smaller for ride requests
in areas outside a city center. Also, the tradeoff be-
tween the size of a cloaked area and the accuracy of the
ride-matching results prevents the use of larger cloaking
areas (i.e., to achieve larger anonymity sets). Second,
PrivateRide does not protect drivers’s privacy, also im-
portant [1]. Third, PrivateRide provides limited account-
ability features to deal with relatively common scenar-
ios such as drivers and riders physically attacking each
other (i.e., safety concerns) or items being lost during
a ride; for many users, such features can be as impor-
tant as their privacy. Fourth, PrivateRide’s usability is
reduced w.r.t. current RHSs because the supported pay-
ment mechanism is less convenient (i.e., PrivateRide re-
quires payments with e-cash bought in advance before a
ride). Moreover, ride-matching is suboptimal, because
the distance between rider and drivers is estimated using
the centers of the cloaked areas, instead of exact loca-
tions, resulting in additional waiting time for riders.

3 System Model
Our goal is to design a RHS that provides stronger pri-
vacy guarantees to both riders and drivers, as well as bet-
ter or equivalent usability and accountability compared
with PrivateRide [39] and current RHSs (e.g., Uber, Lyft,
and Easy Taxi). To do so, we assume a system consisting
of three parties: riders, drivers and the service provider
(SP). We now describe our adversarial and system as-
sumptions.
3.1 Adversarial Assumptions
In our model, riders and drivers are active adversaries.
The SP is a passive adversary (i.e., honest-but-curious).
We assume that most riders and drivers do not collude
with the SP, as drivers are independent contractors rather
than SP’s employees. The case of a covertly active SP
is discussed in Section 7.2. In such a case, we assume
that the SP does not provide riders and drivers with ma-
licious apps. This is a reasonable assumption, because
such attacks can be detected by third-parties via reverse-
engineering or black-box analyses; the risk of public ex-
posure and reputation loss is a strong deterrent against
such attacks.
Given that they have been observed in current RHSs
(i.e., higher chance of occurring), we focus on the fol-
lowing attacks:
• (A1) The riders and drivers might attempt to assault
each other [48]; in extreme cases, a driver might at-
tempt to kidnap and/or kill the rider, or vice versa
[37, 49].
• (A2) The SP uses its knowledge about side informa-
tion about riders and drivers, including their home/work
addresses, together with protocol transcripts, to per-
form large-scale inference attacks to proﬁle riders’ and
drivers’ activities [35].
• (A3) The SP might attempt to carry out targeted attacks
on speciﬁc riders. That is, besides their home/work ad-
dresses, the SP knows the precise pick-up location and
time of a speciﬁc rider and wants to know the drop-off
location and time of this ride, or vice versa [25, 33, 46].
3.2 Design Goals
The goal of ORide is to defend against the attacks listed
in Section 3.1, and to offer the same level of accountabil-
ity and usability as current RHSs, as follows.
• Riders and drivers are held accountable for their behav-
iors during their rides, i.e., the SP is able to identify
misbehaving riders or drivers when needed, e.g., if one
party attacks the other. However, the SP is able to iden-
tify the misbehaving party only with support from the
affected party (or her trusted contacts, see Section 6.)
• The system preserves the convenience and usability
properties offered by current RHSs, such as payment
through credit cards and reputation rating. In addition,
once a rider is matched with a driver, she can track the
location of the driver approaching the pick-up location,
and they can contact each other to coordinate the pick-
up. The system also enables riders to contact drivers of
their past rides to ﬁnd lost items.
3.3 System Assumptions
We assume that the metadata of the network and lower
communication layers cannot be used to identify riders
and drivers or to link their activities. Such an assumption
is reasonable because, in most cases, the smartphones of
drivers and riders do not have ﬁxed public IP addresses;
they access the Internet via a NAT gateway offered by
their cellular provider. If needed, a VPN proxy or Tor
could be used to hide network identiﬁers.
In addition, we assume that, besides localization ca-
pabilities, the rider’s and driver’s smartphones support
peer-to-peer wireless communication, e.g., Bluetooth
and WiFi Direct. Also, for all location-based compu-
tations, the apps use a coordinate system such that the
Euclidean distances correspond to the great-circle dis-
tances, e.g., by using map-projection systems for local
areas such as UTM [47] to convert a pair of (latitude,
longitude) to planar coordinates (x, y). Moreover, drivers
use a navigation app that does not leak their locations to
the SP. This can be done by using a third-party naviga-
tion/trafﬁc app (e.g., Google Maps, TomTom, Garmin)
or pre-fetching the map of their operating areas (e.g., a
city) and using the navigation app in off-line mode.

4 Oblivious Ride-Matching Protocol
One of the challenges in privacy-preserving RHSs is how
to efﬁciently match ride requests to ride offers with-
out revealing the riders’ and drivers’ locations to each
other and to the SP. For this, ORide relies on somewhat-
homomorphic encryption (see Section 4.1) where the rid-
ers and drivers send their encrypted locations to the SP,
from which the SP computes the encrypted squared Eu-
clidean distances between them. We detail this in the
following sections. For details about other cryptographic
primitives used in ORide, see Appendix A.3.
