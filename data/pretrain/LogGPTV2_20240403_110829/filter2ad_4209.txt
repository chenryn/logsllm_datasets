ABSTRACT
Credit networks model transitive IOweYou (IOU) credit between
their users. With their ﬂexible-yet-scalable design and robustness
against intrusion, we are observing a rapid increase in their pop-
ularity as a backbone of real-world permission-less payment set-
tlement networks (e.g., Ripple and Stellar) as well as several other
weak-identity systems requiring Sybil-tolerant communication. In
payment scenarios, due to their unique capability to unite emerging
crypto-currencies and user-deﬁned currencies with the traditional
ﬁat currency and banking systems, several existing and new pay-
ment enterprises are entering in this space. Nevertheless, this en-
thusiasm in the market signiﬁcantly exceeds our understanding of
security, privacy, and reliability of these inherently distributed sys-
tems. Currently employed ad hoc strategies to ﬁx apparent ﬂaws
have made those systems vulnerable to bigger problems once they
become lucrative targets for malicious players.
In this tutorial, we ﬁrst deﬁne the concept of IOU credit net-
works, and describe some of the important credit network applica-
tions. We then describe and analyze recent and ongoing projects to
improve the credit-network security, privacy and reliability. We end
our discussion with interesting open problems and systems chal-
lenges in the ﬁeld. This introductory tutorial is accessible to the
standard CCS audience with graduate-level security knowledge.

INTRODUCTION
Credit networks [3–5] model credit (or trust) among users in a
network through a directed, weighted graph, where the value of
each edge shows the amount of IOU credit that a user is willing to
extend to another. As the loss of credit incurred by the honest users
in a credit network is independent of the number of malicious users
and is instead bounded [3] by the credit they have extended to a
misbehaving user, credit networks constitute the core of a variety
of Sybil-tolerant applications, such as trustworthy online market-
places [16], spam ﬁltering [11], and social networks [12]. Some of

the emerging payment networks, such as Ripple [1] and Stellar [2],
also rely on credit networks to represent and process the settlement
transactions between users. Thanks to their scalability, speed, and
cost-effectiveness for cross-currency transactions across the globe,
several banks [6, 9, 10, 17, 18] have now started to use Ripple as a
backbone for online transactions.
2. PRIVACY ISSUES
Credit Networks, such as Ripple [1] and Stellar [2], similarly to
cryptocurrencies, opted for a blockchain-based consensus to demon-
strate reliability and consistancy of transactions through transparency.
However, this public ledger leaves credit networks highly suscepti-
ble to the privacy attacks. In particular, pseudonymity employed in
Ripple is not effective as transactions still remain linkable to each
other, and they are susceptible to deanonymization attacks. Our
recent work [14] demonstrates that users accounts as well as their
transactions are easily linkable in Ripple. This is clearly conﬂict-
ing with the users’ desire to hide their credit links and their trans-
actions [8], and thus developing a privacy-preserving transaction
scheme is one of the key challenges with the credit networks today.
2.1 Private Credit Network Transactions
In this direction, Moreno-Sanchez et al. [13] formalize the in-
tegrity and privacy requirements of credit network transactions, and
develop PrivPay, a centralized privacy-preserving architecture for
credit networks, based on trusted hardware and data-oblivious com-
putations. PrivPay provides formal privacy guarantees and is found
to efﬁcient enough to support the current Ripple transactions; how-
ever, the usage of trusted hardware can make its employment in real
life quite problematic.
Nevertheless, a centralized cryptographic solution that does not
rely on trusted hardware seems far-fetched; it is unclear how one
could possibly read the network information required to perform
transactions without breaking the privacy of the other users. Our
ongoing work [7] moves from the observation that the user’s credit
links alone determine her available credit in the network and the
amount of credit loss she can incur due to misbehaving users. There-
fore, unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, credit networks are
an ideal target for a distributed architecture where each user main-
tains her own credit links locally and checks that her inﬂow and out-
ﬂow of credit do not change without explicit consent. The work ex-
plores this approach, designing a distributed architecture Whispers
that provides strong privacy guarantees, offers better scalability and
reliability, enforces the correctness of transactions. Whispers, with-
out requiring a blockchain (i.e., ledger and proof-of-work), guar-
antees integrity and privacy of link values and transactions using
a novel combination of secret-sharing-based multi-party computa-
tion and digital signature chains.
1859Although above approaches provide best possible privacy and
integrity guarantees, they are inherently incompatible with the ex-
isting real-world networks such as Ripple and Stellar. Given the
effective attacks such as [14], it is important to develop privacy-
preserving solutions that are compatible with Ripple and Stellar in
their current form.
3. CONCURRENCY ISSUES
In credit networks, transactions over disjoints sets of links can
be easily carried out concurrently. If, however, two or more trans-
actions require more credit than available at a shared link, it is im-
portant to allow one transaction go through and abort the others,
notifying the users in the involved paths. Most credit networks fail
to consider this concurrency (or serialization) issue. To perform
this serialization among distributed transactions, Ripple (and sim-
ilarly Stellar) employ a tailored Ripple Protocol Consensus Algo-
rithm (RPCA). RPCA should allow all non-faulty Ripple parties to
agree on the same set and order of transactions to be applied to the
public ledger in a decentralized manner. However, its safety and
liveness properties have not yet being analyzed at all.
Among the academic solutions, Privpay [13] relies on the cen-
tralized hardware module to decide the order, while Whispers [7]
employ the blocking solution with randomized delays such that
some transactions are not delayed inﬁnitely. In the tutorial, we also
describe our effort to formally deﬁne the serialization requirement
of the asynchronous credit network transaction, and design block-
ing as well as wait-free solutions for this purpose.
Finally, we explore the use of the developed techniques in the
emerging Interledger Protocol [19], a technology to bridge the wide
range of blockchain-based systems together, and the lightning net-
work [15], designed to enable scalable payments in Bitcoin.
4. COMPARISON WITH CRYPTOCURREN-
CIES
The tutorial also compares credit network-based Ripple and Stel-
lar networks with the contemporary Bitcoin and Ethereum like cryp-
tocurrency systems. Cryptocurrencies are limited to transactions
where both transacting parties agree on a common currency. Credit
networks, instead, inherently enable cross-currency transactions in
any user speciﬁed currency as long as they have a credit path of
enough value. Thus, they are considered as a salient technology to-
wards overcoming the drawbacks of traditional banking systems [10].

INTENDED AUDIENCE
The tutorial only expects graduate-level cryptography, security,
and privacy knowledge from its audience. All required security,
distributed systems as well as economics concepts will be intro-
duces before using, and we expect this introductory tutorial is ac-
cessible to the standard ACM CCS audience.
