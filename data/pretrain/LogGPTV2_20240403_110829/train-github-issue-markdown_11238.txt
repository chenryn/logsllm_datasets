The system detects automatically the name of an adder or remover of a
collection by an ENGLISH logic I guess. It relates a dependency to a human
langage and not PHP... Moreover, I suppose it forces an execution time by
parsing words or something else.
For greater flexibility, it would be a good idea to let the developper what
the developper has to do (understand and write its own HUMAN langage)... In my
case, I have to use some specific French words for a collection, and my logic
is broken by an english one. I think we would be able to set the adder and
remover name in the annotation. By default, an english logic could be applyed,
why not ?
