### Title: Blackhat: EU-18 - I Block You Because I Love You: Social Account Identification Attack Against a Website Visitor

In this presentation, we introduce a practical side-channel attack that can identify the social web service accounts of visitors to an attacker's website. Given that user pages and profiles on social web services typically contain personal information such as names and activities, the anonymity of a website visitor can be easily compromised by identifying their social account.

Our attack exploits the widely used user-blocking mechanism, which has the inherent property of returning different content based on whether a user is blocked by another user. The key insight is that an attacker can create an account that holds a binary state (blocked or not blocked) with respect to any other user on the same service. This state can be retrieved as a one-bit data point through a conventional cross-site timing attack when the target user visits the attacker's website.

We generalize this property as "visibility control," which forms the fundamental assumption of our attack. By leveraging a set of controlled accounts, an attacker can flexibly manipulate the data leaked through the side channel. This mechanism enables the design of a robust, large-scale user identification attack on social web services.

We conducted an extensive empirical study and found that at least 12 major social web services are vulnerable to this attack: Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Google+, Twitter, eBay, PornHub, Medium, Xbox Live, Ashley Madison, Roblox, and Xvideos. Our attack achieved 100% accuracy and completed within a short, practical timeframe.

We have shared the details of this attack and proposed countermeasures with the affected service providers and browser vendors. As a result, Twitter and eBay have successfully mitigated the attack by modifying their implementations. Additionally, the "SameSite attribute" for cookies, which helps prevent such attacks, has been added to major browsers including Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and Mozilla Firefox.
