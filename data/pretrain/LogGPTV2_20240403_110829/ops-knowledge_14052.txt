User: I'm using a script that someone else wrote in python.  It's executed from the command line with 3 arguments.
example: "python script.py 1111 2222 3333"
It does it's thing and works perfectly.  The results are NOT saved though, and I would really like to pipe the output to a text file.  Can I simply use similar dos commands to accomplish this?  ie "...333 > output.txt"
I don't really want to post the script here if possible since it's not really my work.
Assistant: That seems to work fine for me in the DOS shell.
