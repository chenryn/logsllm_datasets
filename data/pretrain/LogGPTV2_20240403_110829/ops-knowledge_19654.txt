User: I am using python 3.4.2 IDLE on windows.
When I open the IDLE shell and then open .py file, then it works,
but when I try to open the .py file by double cliking, it just doesn't open, or proceed anything. Looks like as if nothing has happened. 
I would like to open .py file and then just press F5 to see what is going on rather than individually open all the file (I am still beginner to python, I know I can use pycharm, but at this point, just that would be good enough)
Assistant: When you double click on a .py file, it will run it using the Python Interpreter. You can right-click on the file instead and choose to open it in IDLE.
