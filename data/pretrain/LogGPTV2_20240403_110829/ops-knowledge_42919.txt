Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of the worker environment, with the workerEnv.init() ok message appearing multiple times. It also shows the mod_jk child workerEnv in error state 6 and 8. Lastly, it shows the jk2_init() Found child messages, with the child numbers and scoreboard slots changing.
