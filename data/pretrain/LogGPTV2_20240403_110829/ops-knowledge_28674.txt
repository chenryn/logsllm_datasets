User: How are dependencies handled when automating builds with Jenkins?
Assistant: When using Jenkins to build automation, you need to pay attention to the following aspects when dealing with dependencies: 1. Selection of build tools Selecting an appropriate build tool can better handle dependencies. Commonly used build tools include Maven, Gradle, Ant, etc. 2. Project configuration When configuring a project in Jenkins, you need to set up dependencies, including dependent libraries, plug-ins, and other projects. 3. Writing scripts When writing build scripts, you need to pay attention to the dependencies between different steps, and ensure that each step is executed after the required dependencies are completed. 4. Caching In order to improve construction efficiency, dependencies can be cached. For example, Maven uses the local repository to cache downloaded libraries, and Gradle uses Gradle cache to cache downloaded dependencies. 5. Unit testing and integration testing During the construction process, unit testing and integration testing are required to ensure that the dependencies are correct and the build results meet expectations.
