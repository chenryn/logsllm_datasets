Many federal agencies have already begun identifying enterprise assets. Agencies that have 
established CDM program capabilities, such as HWAM [HWAM] and Software Asset 
Management (SWAM) [SWAM], have a rich set of data to draw from when enacting a ZTA. 
Agencies may also have a list of ZTA candidate processes that involve High Value Assets 
(HVA) [M-19-03] that have been identified as key to the agency mission. This work would need 
to exist enterprise- or agency-wide before any business process could be (re)designed with a 
ZTA. These programs must be designed to be expandable and adaptable to changes in the 
enterprise, not only when migrating to ZTA but also when accounting for new assets, services, 
and business processes that become part of the enterprise. 
7.3.3 Identify Key Processes and Evaluate Risks Associated with Executing Process 
The third inventory that an agency should undertake is to identify and rank the business 
processes, data flows, and their relation in the missions of the agency. Business processes should 
inform the circumstances under which resource access requests are granted and denied. An 
enterprise may wish to start with a low-risk business process for the first transition to ZTA as 
disruptions will likely not negatively impact the entire organization. Once enough experience is 
gained, more critical business processes can become candidates. 
Business processes that utilize cloud-based resources or are used by remote workers are often 
good candidates for ZTA and would likely see improvements to availability and security. Rather 
than project the enterprise perimeter into the cloud or bring clients into the enterprise network 
via a VPN, enterprise clients can request cloud services directly. The enterprise’s PEPs ensure 
that enterprise policies are followed before resource access is granted to a client. Planners should 
also consider potential tradeoffs in performance, user experience, and possible increased 
workflow fragility that may occur when implementing ZTA for a given business process. 
7.3.4 Formulating Policies for the ZTA Candidate 
The process of identifying a candidate service or business workflow depends on several factors: 
the importance of the process to the organization, the group of subjects affected, and the current 
state of resources used for the workflow. The value of the asset or workflow based on risk to the 
asset or workflow can be evaluated using the NIST Risk Management Framework [SP800-37].  
After the asset or workflow is identified, identify all upstream resources (e.g., ID management 
systems, databases, micro-services), downstream resources (e.g., logging, security monitoring), 
and entities (e.g., subjects, service accounts) that are used or affected by the workflow. This may 
influence the candidate choice as a first migration to ZTA. An application/service used by an 
identified subset of enterprise subjects (e.g., a purchasing system) may be preferred over one that 
is vital to the entire subject base of the enterprise (e.g., email). 
The enterprise administrators then need to determine the set of criteria (if using a criteria-based 
TA) or confidence level weights (if using a score-based TA) for the resources used in the 
candidate business process (see Section 3.3.1). Administrators may need to adjust these criteria 
or values during the tuning phase. These adjustments are necessary to ensure that policies are 
effective but do not hinder access to resources.

7.3.5 Identifying Candidate Solutions 
Once a list of candidate business processes has been developed, enterprise architects can 
compose a list of candidate solutions. Some deployment models (see Section 3.1) are better 
suited to particular workflows and current enterprise ecosystems. Likewise, some vendor 
solutions are better suited to some use cases than others. These are some factors to consider: 
• Does the solution require that components be installed on the client asset? This may 
limit business processes where nonenterprise-owned assets are used or desired, such as 
BYOD or cross-agency collaborations.  
• Does the solution work where the business process resources exist entirely on 
enterprise premises? Some solutions assume that requested resources will reside in the 
cloud (so-called north-south traffic) and not within an enterprise perimeter (east-west 
traffic). The location of candidate business process resources will influence candidate 
solutions as well as the ZTA for the process.  
• Does the solution provide a means to log interactions for analysis? A key component 
of ZT is the collection and use of data related to the process flow that feeds back into the 
PE when making access decisions.  
• Does the solution provide broad support for different applications, services, and 
protocols? Some solutions may support a broad range of protocols (web, secure shell 
[SSH], etc.) and transports (IPv4 and IPv6), while others may only work with a narrow 
focus such as web or email.  
• Does the solution require changes to subject behavior? Some solutions may require 
additional steps to perform a given workflow. This may change how enterprise subjects 
perform the workflow. 
One solution is to model an existing business process as a pilot program rather than just a 
replacement. This pilot program could be made general to apply to several business processes or 
be made specific to one use case. The pilot can be used as a “proving ground” for ZTA before 
transitioning subjects to the ZTA deployment and away from the legacy process infrastructure. 
7.3.6 Initial Deployment and Monitoring 
Once the candidate workflow and ZTA components are chosen, the initial deployment can start. 
Enterprise administrators must implement the developed policies by using the selected 
components but may wish to operate in an observation and monitoring mode at first. Few 
enterprise policy sets are complete in their first iterations: important user accounts (e.g., 
administrator accounts) may be denied access to resources they need or may not need all the 
access privileges they have been assigned. 
The new ZT business workflow could be operated in reporting-only mode for some time to make 
sure the policies are effective and workable. This also allows the enterprise to gain an 
understanding of baseline asset and resource access requests, behavior, and communication 
patterns. Reporting-only means that access should be granted for most requests, and logs and 
traces of connections should be compared with the initial developed policy. Basic policies such

as denying requests that fail MFA or appear from known, attacker controlled or subverted IP 
addresses should be enforced and logged, but after initial deployment, access polices should be 
more lenient to collect data from actual interactions of the ZT workflow. Once the baseline 
activity patterns for the workflow has been established, anomalous behavior can be more easily 
identify. If it is not possible to operate in a more lenient nature, enterprise network operators 
should monitor logs closely and be prepared to modify access policies based on operational 
experience.  
7.3.7 Expanding the ZTA 
When enough confidence is gained and the workflow policy set is refined, the enterprise enters 
the steady operational phase. The network and assets are still monitored, and traffic is logged 
(see Section 2.1), but responses and policy modifications are done at a lower tempo as they 
should not be severe. The subjects and stakeholders of the resources and processes involved 
should also provide feedback to improve operations. At this stage, the enterprise administrators 
can begin planning the next phase of ZT deployment. Like the previous rollout, a candidate 
workflow and solution set need to be identified and initial policies developed.  
However, if a change occurs to the workflow, the operating ZT architecture needs to be 
reevaluated. Significate changes to the system—such as new devices, major updates to software 
(especially ZT logical components), and shifts in organizational structure—may result in changes 
to the workflow or policies. In effect, the entire process should be reconsidered with the 
assumption that some of the work has already been done. For example, new devices have been 
purchased, but no new user accounts have been created, so only the device inventory needs to be 
updated.
