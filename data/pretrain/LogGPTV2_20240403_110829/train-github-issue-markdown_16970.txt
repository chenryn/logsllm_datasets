It is very common to add statistical annotations when comparing boxplots or
barplots. See the screenshot for an example.
(A) Are there any plans to include a similar feature or (B) to at least
facilitate the addition of such annotations?

So far, it's rather difficult to add such annotations because seaborn's
`boxplot()` and `barplot()` don't expose the boxes and bars they draw. One
could grab the matplotlib artists and try to reverse engineer the plot
content, but this is way too difficult.
I've found statannot, a great attempt to work around this missing feature. But
the solution re-implements some of seaborn's code and recreates the plots
internally. Also, the annotation logic was not matching my needs perfectly.
Before digging into statannot, I thought to check first why seaborn is not
offering that feature in first place.
Thanks!
