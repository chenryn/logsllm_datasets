## Executive Summary
Since the inception of the ETSI NFV ISG in Darmstadt in October 2012, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has captured the imagination of the telecommunications industry. The benefits and promises of NFV are well understood, and significant advancements have been made in the underlying technologies, such as server hardware (Intel), hypervisor technology (Red Hat), and software libraries (Intel® DPDK). These improvements have enabled the development of telco-grade Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), such as Brocade’s VRouter 5600, which have proliferated and evolved extensively.

However, to fully realize the potential of these VNFs, they must be properly deployed on the underlying infrastructure to leverage the new technological advancements. NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) and the associated information models, which describe both the infrastructure and VNF requirements, are crucial for achieving this goal effectively and cost-efficiently. Traditional cloud management systems (CMS) are insufficient for true NFV deployments.

Cyan, Brocade, Intel, and Red Hat, in collaboration with Telefónica's NFV Reference Lab in Madrid, have demonstrated how a realistic network scenario can be designed, modeled, and deployed via NFV Orchestration (Cyan Blue Planet) onto an NFV-ready infrastructure through Telefónica's Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM). This optimized NFV delivery stack was compared to a typical cloud deployment model, showing up to a 100x improvement in throughput for a typical routing scenario.

The key to unlocking this performance is the correct modeling of the essential attributes required by VNFs and exposing this information as deployment decision criteria in the NFV delivery stack, i.e., the NFV Orchestrator and the VIM. The availability of such NFV-ready orchestration components, along with appropriate standardized descriptors for VNFs and infrastructure, will be the key enablers for large-scale NFV deployments in the coming years.

## Introduction
A key component of the NFV vision is the transformation of the network into a data center, leveraging the commodity price points and capabilities from the global investment in data center technology to deliver telco-grade virtual network appliances as VNFs. Traditionally, network functions like Evolved Packet Core (EPC), 3G wireless nodes, Broadband Network Gateways (BNG), Provider Edge (PE) routers, and firewalls have been delivered on bespoke standalone appliances. NFV aims to replace this hardware-centric approach with a software model that delivers comparable functionality on standard high-volume industry server hardware.

Deploying a telco network service presents additional complexities not typically found in today's data centers:
- Each telco service comes with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that must be achieved and enforced, considering scalability as service adoption increases.
- Control over network topology, VNF location, link bandwidths, and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees are critical in telco environments.
- In the NFV world, VNFs will be provided by multiple vendors, necessitating a well-understood and open standard-based service information model. This white paper proposes using TOSCA as the service description language, enabling an easy extension path to include key NFV attributes for deterministic performance.

Recent advancements in x86 processors, hypervisors, and specialized open-source software libraries like DPDK have enabled standard high-volume servers to handle I/O-intensive workloads efficiently. To ensure reliable NFV deployments, it is essential to allocate the appropriate infrastructure resources to the VNFs. Practices such as considering internal server memory topology, CPU and I/O interface allocation, and using huge pages for efficient lookups become essential to assure VNF SLAs in terms of performance, scalability, and predictability.

The ETSI-NFV reference architecture defines a layered approach to NFV deployment (see Figure 1). To ensure portable and deterministic VNF performance, it is crucial to expose the relevant NFVI attributes through the NFV delivery stack, allowing the management and orchestration layers to ensure correct resource allocation for the end-to-end network service scenario.

## Service Scenario Overview
### VNF Routing Scenario Overview
- **Scenario**: A routed VNF forwarding graph using Brocade Vyatta vRouters as VNFs, achieving 40 Gbps network throughput between the ingress and egress points at Routers A and C (see Figure 2).
- **Key Enablers**: The exposure of performance enablers (NFVI attributes) in the VNF Descriptor and the importance of good VNF design (Vyatta vRouter) are crucial for enabling this service deployment.
- **NFV Delivery Stack**: The end-to-end NFV service delivery stack, including the information model, VNF, NFV Orchestrator, VIM, and NFVI, is required for optimal VNF service chain deployment.
- **Information Models**: The use of industry-standard, open, and extensible information models such as TOSCA and suitable VNF formats is crucial for enabling an open ecosystem of VNF vendors to construct and deliver their services into this new end-to-end architecture.

### Cloud Versus NFV
The demonstration is hosted at Telefónica’s NFV Reference Lab in Madrid and provides two separate deployment environments:
- **NFV-Ready NFVI Pool**: With a Telefónica-developed NFV-ready VIM implementing Enhanced Platform Awareness (EPA) and a Cyan NFV-Orchestrator supporting advanced VNF deployment using enhanced NFV information models.
- **Standard Cloud Infrastructure Pool**: A classic cloud computing environment with the same Telefónica VIM connected to the same Cyan NFV-Orchestrator but not using the enhanced information model for deployment.

Starting with both server pools empty, the demo scenario is deployed onto each platform through the Orchestrator. Performance measurements show much higher and stable throughput in the NFV-ready scenario.

### Scenario Execution Results
#### Initial Sub-Optimal Cloud Deployment
The initial deployment demonstrates the typical issues with a "blind" enterprise-cloud-like deployment of a typical VNF onto an underlying non-NFV-optimized infrastructure. The Brocade routing scenario is deployed, but due to the suboptimal NFV information model, the Brocade vRouter is incorrectly deployed and unable to achieve its designed 23 Mpps (40 Gbps @ 192 byte packet size), instead reaching only 270 Kpps. Key issues include:
- No PCIe pass-through: The NIC is not directly connected to the vRouter, leading to a suboptimal networking path.
- No NUMA affinity: vCPUs are arbitrarily allocated from CPU sockets, potentially using non-local memory buses.
- No CPU pinning: vCPUs allocated to the vRouter may be shared or dynamically rescheduled, limiting determinism.
- No 1G Huge Page setup: This limits DPDK performance and does not correctly leverage recent advances in server IOTBL and VTd architecture, especially for small packet sizes.

## Conclusions
The results demonstrate the significant benefits of an end-to-end NFV-aware system, showcasing up to a 100x improvement in throughput compared to a typical enterprise cloud. The correct modeling of VNF attributes and the use of NFV-ready orchestration components, along with standardized descriptors, are key enablers for large-scale NFV deployments.
