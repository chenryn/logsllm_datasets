User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I log authentication attempts with samba? I have users authenticating with squid (NTLM) to an Active Directory server using Samba 3.5.4 and I'd like to log users' login attempts.  

I'd like a line showing something like:
TIMESTAMP    username@DOMAIN    SUCCESS/FAILURE

Assistant: If you modify the log level line in /etc/samba/smb.conf to read:

log level = 1 winbind:5

You do get the information I'm after (by default logged to /var/log/samba/log.DOMAIN), but it's very noisy and the log messages are split over two lines.  Not exactly what I'm looking for but it might have to do.
