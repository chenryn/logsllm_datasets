If we open the file with a PDF reader, we get a 2-page document with no author.
Let's look at the metadata instead:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/hackazon/CyberTank_Research# exiftool cybertank-research.pdf | grep Creator
Creator Tool                    : Adobe Acrobat 7.0
Creator                         : Jake Cyba
```

However, it is possible to mark this section with the mouse and copy it to a text editor, or user a tool such as `pdftotext`:
```console

root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/hackazon/CyberTank_Research# cat cybertank-research.txt | grep ID

Using an [online barcode scanner](https://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com/) we find out that this is a [Royal Mail 4-State Customer Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RM4SCC) barcode which encodes the following post code:
```
GL1337HF
```
The answer that was accepted is `GL13 37HF`.
