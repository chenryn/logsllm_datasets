 L-3 Communications Westwood Corp. v. Robicharux, 2007 WL 
756528 (E.D. La. Mar 08, 2007)
 Defendant employees of L-3  
 Computer forensics shows 110,000 files copied to 120 GB 
external hard drive.
 L-3's loss of trade secrets and lost profits not contemplated by 
the CFAA. Losses under CFAA are compensable when they 
result from damage to a computer system or the inoperability 
of the accessed system. CFAA permits recovery for loss 
revenue only where connected to an interruption of service. 
There is no allegation that there was damage to L-3's computer 
or an interruption of service in this case.
Because L-3 has not asserted that there was damage to their 
computers or an interruption of service, it has not alleged a 
cognizable loss under the CFAA. Accordingly, L-3 has not 
demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the 
CFAA claim.

 P.C. of Yonkers, Inc. v. Celebrations! The Party and Seasonal 
Superstore, L.L.C., 2007 WL 708978 (D. N.J. Mar 05, 2007)
 CFAA's private cause of action sets forth a two-part injury 
requirement. Plaintiff must:(1) suffer a root injury of damage or
loss; and (2) suffer one of five operatively-substantial effects set 
forth in subsection (a)(5)(B)(i)-(v).
 (i) loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period (and, for purposes of an 
investigation, prosecution, or other proceeding brought by the United States 
only, loss resulting from a related course of conduct affecting 1 or more other 
protected computers) aggregating at least $5,000 in value; 
 (ii) the modification or impairment, or potential modification or impairment, 
of the medical examination, diagnosis, treatment, or care of 1 or more 
individuals; 
 (iii) physical injury to any person; 
 (iv) a threat to public health or safety; or 
 (v) damage affecting a computer system used by or for a government entity in 
furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national 
security.

 P.C. of Yonkers, Inc. v. Celebrations! The Party and Seasonal 
Superstore, L.L.C., 2007 WL 708978 (D. N.J. Mar 05, 2007)
 No damage to the data, system, or information on Plaintiffs' 
computers is alleged within Plaintiffs' CFAA claims
 Loss, treated separate from damage under the CFAA, is defined as
"any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of 
responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and 
restoring the data, program, system, or information to its 
condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, 
or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption 
of service.
 The plain language of the CFAA treats lost revenue as a different 
concept from incurred costs, and permits recovery of the former 
only where connected to an interruption in service.
 Plaintiffs have alleged that as a result of Defendants' unauthorized 
access and use of the information they have suffered and will 
continue to suffer substantial losses in excess of $5,000.00, 
including but not limited to losses sustained in responding to 
defendants' actions, investigating defendants' actions and taking 
remedial steps to prevent defendants' further actions.

 Hawkins v. Cavalli, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73143 (N.D. Cal. 
September 22, 2006)
 Issue- Trial Court's admission of computer records were 
unreliable and violated due process rights
 Held- In upholding the admission of the evidence, the 
California Court of Appeal was persuaded by a Louisiana case, 
which held that printouts of the results of a computer's internal 
operations are not hearsay, because they are not statements, 
nor are they representations of statements placed into the 
computer by out of court declarants. State v. Armstead, 432 
So.2d 837, 840 (La. 1983). Under Armstead, the test for 
admissibility of a printout reflecting a computer's internal 
operations is not whether the printout was made in the regular 
course of business, but whether the computer was functioning 
properly at the time the printout was produced.

 Hawkins v. Cavalli, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73143 (N.D. Cal. 
September 22, 2006)
 Some courts consider all computer records hearsay, admissible 
only under the business records or public records exceptions. 
 Other courts distinguish between computer-stored records and 
computer-generated records. These courts have held that computer-
generated records are not hearsay because they are independent of 
human observations and reporting. Id. at 157-58; see also, e.g., 
United States v. Khorozian, 333 F.3d 498, 505 (3d Cir. 2003)
(citing Mueller & Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence, § 380, at 65 (2d 
ed. 1994)) (holding that a header generated by a fax machine was
not hearsay, because "nothing 'said' by a machine... is hearsay"); 
United States v. Hamilton, 413 F.3d 1138, 1142 (10th Cir. 2005)
(holding that header information accompanying pornographic 
images uploaded to the internet were not hearsay). These courts 
have reasoned that because the computer instantaneously generated 
the header information without the assistance of a person, there
was neither a "statement" nor a "declarant."

 Defendant also argues that it is entitled to obtain production of the 
Myspace.com private email communications because they may 
contain statements made by Plaintiff and witnesses about the 
subject matter of this case which could presumably constitute 
admissions by Plaintiff or which could potentially be used to 
impeach the witnesses' testimony. In addition, Defendant argues 
that the private email messages may contain information that 
Plaintiff's alleged severe emotional distress was caused by factors 
other than Defendant's alleged sexual harassment misconduct.

 Mackelprang v. Fid. Nat'l Title Agency of Nev., Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 2379 (D. Nev January 9, 2007)
 The Myspace.com accounts were opened several months after 
Plaintiff left Defendant's employment. Assuming that the 
Myspace.com account contains sexually related email messages 
exchanged between Plaintiff and others, such evidence would not 
be admissible to support Defendants' defense that their prior 
alleged sexual conduct was welcomed by Plaintiff. The courts 
applying Rule 412 have declined to recognize a sufficiently 
relevant connection between a plaintiff's non-work related sexual 
activity and the allegation that he or she was subjected to 
unwelcome and offensive sexual advancements in the workplace.
 Ordering Plaintiff to execute the consent and authorization form for 
release of all of the private email messages on Plaintiff's 
Myspace.com internet accounts would allow Defendants to cast too
wide a net for any information that might be relevant and 
discoverable.

 The trustee argued that the law firm, after having notice of its duty 
to preserve electronic evidence, either lost or destroyed backup
tapes for the years most relevant to the firm's representation of the 
debtor. The court found that the law firm and its counsel responded 
to legitimate discovery requests with disingenuousness, 
obfuscation, and frivolous claims of privilege and that they twice 
filed meritless appeals of non-appealable discovery orders in 
attempts to prevent meaningful discovery by the trustee. The court 
concluded that the conduct of the firm and its counsel was totally 
devoid of the cooperation required by the rules governing 
discovery and that monetary sanctions were appropriate.

Plaintiff alleged that the CEO stole confidential and proprietary 
information from the corporation; breach of contract; breach of fiduciary 
duty; theft of  trade secret; and violation of the Computer Fraud and 
Abuse Act (CFAA)
Corporation was an electrical engineering company involved in the 
manufacture and sale of integrated circuits. CEO counterclaims against 
the corporation for declaratory relief regarding ownership of the 
intellectual property, misappropriation, unjust enrichment, and 
intentional interference with contract relations and prospective economic 
advantage. 
Ownership of the underlying technology rested with the corporation. 
Court noted former CEO signed a valid employee agreement, which 
contained a confidentiality provision that CEO breached when he 
removed and destroyed provisional patent information from the 
corporation's files and property. CEO's unauthorized destruction of the 
corporation's electronic files entitled the corporation to summary 
judgment on the CFAA claim.
