User: I have tried uninstalling it and have searched other answers. None of them have worked; IDLE opens, but I can't run anything I write.
Assistant: First uninstall the application.Then reinstall it BUT at the time of reinstallation try  -n at the end of location adress. It worked for me, you can copy the below text and paste it at the location while installing it.
“C:\Program Files\Python32\pythonw.exe” lib\idlelib\idle.py -n
