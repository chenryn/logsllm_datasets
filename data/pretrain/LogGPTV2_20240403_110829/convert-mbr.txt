### Convert MBR

**Description:**
The `convert mbr` command is used to change an empty basic disk with the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partition style into a basic disk with the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition style. This operation requires that a basic disk be selected. Use the `select disk` command to choose and focus on the desired basic disk.

**Important:**
- The disk must be empty before it can be converted to a basic disk. Ensure you back up all data, and delete any existing partitions or volumes before proceeding with the conversion.

**Note:**
- For detailed instructions on how to use this command, refer to the guide: "Change a GUID Partition Table Disk into a Master Boot Record Disk."

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
convert mbr [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**
- **noerr**: (Optional) For scripting purposes. If an error occurs, DiskPart will continue to process subsequent commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**
To convert a basic disk from GPT partition style to MBR partition style, type:
```plaintext
convert mbr
```

**Steps:**
1. Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
2. Use the `list disk` command to identify the disk you want to convert.
3. Select the disk using the `select disk <number>` command, where `<number>` is the disk number.
4. Execute the `convert mbr` command to perform the conversion.

**Example:**
```plaintext
list disk
select disk 0
convert mbr
```

This sequence of commands will convert the selected disk from GPT to MBR.
