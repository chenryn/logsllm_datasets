 **TypeScript Version:** 1.8.0-beta
VS Code's Javascript Salsa language service seems to break down as soon as I
type a dynamic require into the buffer. I lose all language features:
intellisense, mark occurrences, etc. I can only get out of that state by
reloading Code's window.
    require('' + '');
