this tool, you can edit and debug HTML, CSS and JavaScript live in any webpage to see
the effect of changes. It helps in analyzing JS files to find XSS vulnerabilities.
Hackbar
Hackbar is a simple penetration tool for Firefox. It helps in testing simple SQL injection
and XSS holes. You cannot execute standard exploits but you can easily use it to test
whethervulnerabilityexistsornot.YoucanalsomanuallysubmitformdatawithGETor
POST requests.
Websecurify
WebSecurify can detect most common vulnerabilities in web applications. This tool can
easily detect XSS, SQL injection and other web application vulnerability.
Cookie Manager+
Allows you to view, edit and create new cookies. It also shows extra information about
cookies, edit multiple cookies at once, backup and restore cookies, etc.
XSS Me
XSS-Me is used to find reflected XSS vulnerabilities from a browser. It scans all forms
of the page, and then performs an attack on the selected pages with pre-defined XSS
payloads. After the scan is complete, it lists all the pages that renders a payload on the
page, and may be vulnerable to XSS. With those results, you should manually confirm
the vulnerabilities found.

The Exploit Database
Though not exactly online training, this site includes exploits for discovered
vulnerabilities, often linking them to CVEs where possible. While using the
actual code supplied should be done with extreme caution as it can be
destructive, this is helpful for finding vulnerabilities if a target is using out
of site software and reading the code is helpful to understand what type of
input can be supplied to exploit a site.

25. Glossary
Black Hat Hacker
A Black Hat Hacker is a hacker who “violates computer security for little
reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain” (Robert Moore, 2005,
Cybercrime). Black Hats are also referred to as the “crackers” within the
security industry and modern programmers. These hackers often perform
malicious actions to destroy, modify or steal data. This is the opposite of a
White Hat Hacker.
Buffer Overflow
A Buffer Overflow is a situation where a program writing data to a buffer, or
area of memory, has more data to write than space that is actually allocated
for that memory. As a result, the program ends up writing over memory that
is it should not be.
Bug Bounty Program
AdealofferedbywebsiteswherebyWhiteHatHackerscanreceiverecognition
or compensation for reporting bugs, particularly security related vulnerabili-
ties. Examples include HackerOne.com and Bugcrowd.com
Bug Report
A Researcher’s description of a potential security vulnerability in a particular
product or service.
CRLF Injection
CRLF, or Carriage Return Line Feed, Injection is a type of vulnerability that
occurs when a user manages to insert a CRLF into an application. This is
sometimes also called HTTP Response Splitting.
Glossary 186
Cross Site Request Forgery
ACrossSiteRequestForgery,orCSRF,attackoccurswhenamaliciouswebsite,
email, instant message, application, etc. causes a user’s web browser to

Cross Site Scripting
Crosssitescripting,orXSS,involveawebsiteincludingunintendedJavascript
code which is subsequently passes on to users which execute that code via
their browsers.
HTML Injection
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) injection, also sometimes referred to as
virtual defacement, is really an attack on a site made possible by allowing a
malicious user to inject HTML into the site by not handling that user’s input
properly.
HTTP Parameter Pollution
