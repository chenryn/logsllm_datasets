the month; note that announce rates for H1 are underestimated since H1 sites
are not required to use NPN/ALPN. The table also reports the total number
of probed sites. From November 2014 to August 2015, we use the Alexa Top 1
Million list fetched on November 10th, 2014. Beginning in September 2015, we
merge the current Alexa list with our own each day, constantly expanding the
pool of sites we query (1.8 M as of October 16th 2015).
Overview. From November 2014 through August 2015, Table 1 shows mostly
constant H1 and SPDY announce rates, with the exception of a large drop in May
2015 (2.2 and 2.5 percentage points respectively.2) By contrast, the H2 announce
rate grows by 50 %—from 1.4 % to 2.2 %—with most of the growth occurring
after May 2015, when H2 was standardized. As we start expanding the pool of
sites that we probe (September 2015), H1 and SPDY announce rates grow slowly
(SPDY grows from 5.1 % in July to 5.7 % in October), while H2 announce rates
grow more quickly (2.2 % in July to 3.7 % in October). Interestingly, we measured
a 0.1 % drop in SPDY in October (about 2,000 sites) and a 0.6 % increase in H2
2 We did not ﬁnd a public explanation of this drop, but we veriﬁed it was not mea-
surement error.

NPN, ALPN, and H2C. As of October 2015, 50 % of the sites supporting NPN
also support ALPN. We added ALPN support to our measurement platform in
September 2015; previous manual ALPN tests showed less than 0.5 % adoption.
Although not shown in the table, as of October 2015 there are already 1,200
websites supporting ALPN but not NPN, 20 % more than in September. H2C
announcement also grows quickly, reaching 1.37 % in October 2015 (about 22,000
sites). However, our UPGRADE header tests found only 20–30 sites that actually
support H2C.
H2 Adoption. We now examine H2 adoption in detail. Figure 1(a) shows
the evolution of the number of websites that (1) announce H2 support (H2-
announce), (2) respond using H2, even just to return an error page or redirect
(H2-partial), and (3) actually serve page content with H2 (H2-true, cf. Sect. 3).
Figure 1(a) shows the substantial growth of H2 adoption after its standardiza-
tion (May 2015). The Figure also shows a large diﬀerence between “announced”
(H2-announce) and “actual” H2 support (H2-partial and H2-true). However, while
between November 2014 and May 2015 only 5 % of the websites announcing H2
support actually responded using H2 (H2-partial), this increases to 55 % as of
October 2015. We also see that before May 2015, most websites serving content
with H2 are well conﬁgured and properly working (i.e., the gap between H2-
partial and H2-true is small). After May, the gap widens considerably: most new
websites supporting H2 show some misconﬁguration, like redirecting to an error
page. This trend continues until October 2015 when the gap between H2-partial
and H2-true is suddenly reduced.
Web Server Implementations. In order to further understand the diﬀerent lev-
els of H2 support noted above, Fig. 1(b) plots the popularity of the web server
implementations powering the H2-true websites. Note that the resolution of this
data is weekly until September 2015 and daily thereafter. For visibility, Fig. 1(b)
shows only the 6 most popular web-server implementations (out of the 53 encoun-
tered). Figure 1(b) shows that, between October 2014 and May 2015, most H2-
true websites are powered by Google web-servers (google frontend, gws, gse and
sﬀe). Then, in May 2015, two new H2 implementations debut: LiteSpeed and

NGINX. Their adoption rates are very diﬀerent; while LiteSpeed websites are
quickly updated—LiteSpeed usage grows from 10 websites to 2,000 within two
months—NGINX websites upgrade more slowly. The combination of fast adop-
tion and the fact that most LiteSpeed websites are H2-partial and not H2-true
suggests that LiteSpeed is used for virtual hosting more than NGINX. Despite
lower overall numbers, NGINX currently powers more than 7,000 H2-true web-
sites (71.7 % of all H2-true websites) compared to LiteSpeed’s 1,300.
Notable Events. Figure 1(a) shows a few events that are worth noting. First, the
number of servers supporting H2 drastically drops over a period of four days
(December 14th–18th). This is because Google, the primary adopter of H2 at
that time, disabled H2 support on their servers (cf. Fig. 1(b)) due to an issue with
SDCH compressed content in Chromium.3 It takes a month for the problem to
be ﬁxed, and H2 support is re-enabled again over four days (January 11th–15th),
likely reﬂecting a speciﬁc roll-out policy for server conﬁguration changes. The
next interesting event happens between May and June 2015, when the number
of H2-partial websites—though they are mostly error pages—doubles from 600 to
1,200. This spike is due to Hawk Host, a virtual web hosting provider, updating
its servers with the latest version of LiteSpeed, which supports H2 (cf. Fig. 1(b)).4
Figure 1(a) also shows a sudden increase in H2 support on October 3rd, caused
by NGINX’s footprint growing 40 % (from 25,000 to 35,000 websites) thanks to
WordPress updating to the latest NGINX release.5 Finally, note that the spikes
in August and September are due to the extension of the pool of websites we
query (cf. Table 1).

Takeaway: The H2 adoption trend reﬂects the broader Internet ecosystem,
where most websites do not control their own technology stacks. There are a few
big players responsible for the spread of new technologies; the average website
owners might not even know they are serving content over H2.
4.2 Website Structure
Number of Objects. Modern web pages are usually composed of several
embedded objects, including images, JavaScripts, and style sheets. During our
11-month measurement campaign, we ﬁnd no indication of a diﬀerence in the
number of objects between pages served with H1 and H2 (cf. Fig. 2(a)). To ver-
ify this quantitatively, we compute the cosine similarity of the object counts for
H1 and H2 every week and ﬁnd values ranging from 0.96 to 0.98. Thus, at a
macroscopic level, there is no diﬀerence in the content composition between the
two protocols. Figure 2(a) also shows that from November 2014 to May 2015,
pages served with H2 are mostly small pages, i.e., 50 % have 10 objects or less.
After May 2015, more complex websites started to support H2; for example, in
October 2015, 50 % of websites have about 60 objects, which is in line with the
average number of objects per webpage reported in [21].
Fig. 2. Content analysis and delivery (Cleveland).
The objects embedded within a web page often reside on another webserver
and the browser must open new TCP connections independent of the application
protocol in use. In addition, the browser must renegotiate which application
protocol to use for each new TCP connection. It follows that even if a website
supports H2, it is possible that only a fraction of its objects are delivered using
H2. Although not shown due to space limitations, we ﬁnd that half of the websites
actually serve about 50 % of their content using H2. Only 10 % of the websites
serve 100 % of their objects using H2; these websites contain fewer objects and
have an overall smaller size—400 KB on average compared to 1.5MB for all
websites.
