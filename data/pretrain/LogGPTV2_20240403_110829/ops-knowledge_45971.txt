User: How to set the firewall policy of the system to ensure the security and stability of the server?
Assistant: In order to ensure the security and stability of the server, the following are some suggestions for setting the system firewall policy: 1. Determine the ports and services that need to be opened. Only allow these ports and protocol traffic to pass through in settings to prevent malicious attacks and unnecessary traffic from entering the system. 2. Minimize the number of open ports The administrator should minimize the number of open ports as much as possible, and only open the necessary ports. Opening too many ports increases the risk of your server being attacked. 3. Preventing Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) Administrators can set rules to prevent DDoS attacks, such as limiting the number of connections and traffic from the same IP address, and enabling reverse proxy services as needed. 4. Enforce encrypted communication The administrator can enforce the use of SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt data transmission to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and data leakage. 5. Prevent malware and vulnerability attacks Administrators need to update the software and patches on the server in time to fix possible vulnerabilities. In addition, firewalls can block malware and attacks, such as denying malicious traffic and suspending access to devices. 6. Monitor and log firewall activity Administrators should regularly monitor and log firewall activity in order to identify and respond to potential attack events. If malicious behavior is detected, the administrator should take necessary measures in time to prevent the attacker from exploiting the attack. It should be noted that the above suggestions do not solve all server security problems. Administrators should take other security measures such as using strong passwords, regularly backing up data, restricting remote access, etc. to maximize server security.
