User: I need to execute several shell scripts with python, some scripts would export environment parameters, so I need to execute them in the same process, otherwise, other scripts can't see the new environment parameters
in one word, I want to let the shell script change the environment of the python process
so I should not use subprocess, any idea how to realize it?
Assistant: What if you make a 'master' shell script that would execute all the others in sequence? This way you'll only have to create a single sub-process yourself, and the individual scripts will share the same environment. 
If, however, you would like to interleave script executions with Python code, then you would probably have to make each of the scripts echo its environment to stdout before exiting, parse that, and then pass it into the next script (subprocess.Popen() accepts the env parameter, which is a map.)
