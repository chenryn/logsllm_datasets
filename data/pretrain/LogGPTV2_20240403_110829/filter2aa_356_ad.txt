### Platter Swap Procedure for Hard Drive Data Recovery

#### Single-Platter Replacement
1. **Positioning the Screwdriver:**
   - Position the screwdriver at the center of the platter and rotate the drive just enough to slide the platter onto the screwdriver.
   - Repeat this process for the faulty drive, transferring the platter to the good drive.

2. **Removing the Platter:**
   - The old platter is likely to be discarded, so remove it carefully without damaging the rest of the drive.

3. **Repositioning the Heads:**
   - Use Post-it notes in a V-shape to reposition the heads on the platter, similar to the head replacement procedure.
   - Ensure the orientation remains consistent to maintain the correct alignment when placing the platter back on the new drive.

#### Multi-Platter Replacement
1. **Special Tool Requirement:**
   - For multi-platter replacements, a special tool called a Platter Replacement Stand is necessary. This tool can be purchased from SalvationData.com for approximately $250 plus shipping.
   - The stand is heavy, weighing about 10 pounds, and resembles a coffee can with a slit on the side.

2. **Using the Platter Replacement Stand:**
   - After moving the heads out of the way, place the stand over the platters and tighten it by pressing down on the metal piece in the slit.
   - The stand includes a lid that sits on the top ring of the platters, holding the screws in place and preventing them from rolling around.
   - The pressure from the stand will keep the platters together, but handle them with care to minimize movement and ensure they remain aligned.

3. **Transfer Process:**
   - Transfer the platters directly from one hard drive to another as quickly and with as little movement as possible to maintain alignment.
   - Reassemble the drive as you would for a head stack or single platter replacement, using the Platter Replacement Stand to move the platters.

### Additional Research Information and Notes

#### Matching Serial Numbers on Hard Drives
- **Maxtor, Quantum, Seagate:**
  - The number of heads can be identified from the serial numbers.
  - **Quantum:** The third number in the serial number indicates the number of heads.
  - **Seagate:** The third symbol in the serial number represents the heads. Some Seagate drives have extra heads that can be turned off and on, potentially changing the firmware revision.
  - **Maxtor:** The second number in the serial number represents the number of heads.

- **Fujitsu:**
  - The first xx-Xxxx in the serial number must match.

- **IBM and Hitachi:**
  - IBM MLC codes must match.
  - **Hitachi 3.5-inch:** Firmware code needs to match.
  - **Hitachi 2.5-inch:** PCB revision must match.

- **Western Digital:**
  - DCM codes (fifth and sixth numbers) must match.
  - No Western Digital drives with the letter R in the code (EB and BB models).
  - Western Digital EB and BB models have the head stack affixed from the lid.
  - The sixth character in the model number indicates the cache size (U = 2MB, V = 8MB).

- **Samsung:**
  - The fourth character in the alpha code on the rear label and the seventh character in the model number (buffer size) must match.

- **Refurbished Drives:**
  - Refurbished drives cannot be used as donor drives due to potential substandard parts and difficulty in matching them to a good drive.

### Random Notes and Ideas for Data Recovery

1. **Drive Sleep and Board Replacement:**
   - If a drive goes to sleep, replace the board while the drive is live.
   
2. **Partition Boundaries:**
   - Partitions start on cylinder boundaries.
   
3. **Hard Drive Safe Mode:**
   - Hard drives have a safe mode for troubleshooting.
   
4. **LaCie Drives:**
   - LaCie problems can be fixed by mounting the drive on a Mac system.
   
5. **Windows Crashes:**
   - Use Ubuntu to read files from drives that cause Windows to crash.
   
6. **MFT Problems:**
   - Retry reading smaller blocks if there are issues with the Master File Table (MFT).
   
7. **SA Area Repair:**
   - Rewriting the SA area may be necessary if the drive parts are good.
   
8. **SA Code:**
   - SA code can be replaced for data destruction or encryption.
   
9. **Signal Interpretation:**
   - Hard drives interpret signals to represent 0s and 1s, taking into account signal distortion and interface problems.
   
10. **Chip Resoldering:**
    - Remove and resolder a chip from the PCB to fix specific problems with burned or cracked chips.
    
11. **SATA Soft Resets:**
    - SATA drives require a hard reset of the controller, unlike PCI or ATA buses.
    
12. **ATA-3 Specification:**
    - The ATA-3 specification disabled hard drive read without retry, which is now internal to the drive.
    
13. **Seagate Serial Interface:**
    - Seagate drives use a serial interface that shows drive stats. A "FFFF mask FFFF mask" indicates a head error.
    
14. **Standard Read:**
    - If a drive is read with a standard read, it does not need to be read again, but ECC can be used for comparison in a later pass.
    
15. **PIO Mode:**
    - Force the drive to use PIO mode instead of DMA/UDMA modes if it fails to read in UDMA mode.
    
16. **Defect Tables:**
    - Moving a powered-on drive's board to a new drive can clear wrong defect tables.
    
17. **Servo Wedge:**
    - Misaligned platters can be irreparably damaged by writing over the servo wedge.
    
18. **Thermal Stability:**
    - Increased thermal heat reduces bit stability, and high areal density exacerbates degradation. Drives automatically rewrite detected decayed data.
    
19. **Heat Storage:**
    - Long-term storage in heat is extremely detrimental to hard drives.
    
20. **Adaptec Controller:**
    - The Adaptec ATA Raid 1200A Controller combined with MHDD is excellent for recovery software.
    
21. **HPA Detection:**
    - To determine if an HPA exists, check if the LBA Maximum equals the Maximum Native LBA.
    
22. **Partition Alignment:**
    - Partitions created with standard tools are cylinder-aligned. Dynamic disks use LDM, which is at the end of the disk and requires backward scanning.
    
23. **Partition Table Signatures:**
    - All partition table signatures end in 55 AA. 80 is active, 0B is FAT32, and 0F is extended.
    
24. **NTFS Files:**
    - Everything in NTFS is a file, including $boot.
    
25. **Sector Addressing:**
    - A sector is the smallest addressable unit on the disk. You can read more than one sector but not less.
    
26. **Head Stack Protection:**
    - Use straws to protect the head stack during replacement.
    
27. **Head Numbering:**
    - Even if lower parts of the head stack do not have heads, they are still numbered.
    
28. **Hardware Changes:**
    - Increasingly, drives have no chance for parts replacement due to hardware changes.
    
29. **NV Ram and Mapping:**
    - Some drives store lists in NV Ram on the PCB. Swapping boards can cause mapping issues, leading to data overwrite.
