of the center of the platter and turn the drive just enough to get 
the platter to slide on to the screw driver. I will do the same for 
the bad drive to move the platter to the good drive. 
. The platter will most likely never be used again so just get it out 
however you can without affecting the rest of the drive. 
Again I use the Post-it notes in the shape of a V to get the heads 
back on the platter as I did in the head replacement. 
Be very careful to keep the orientation in the same direction to so that the platter will 
be in the correct location when you put the platter back on the new drive.  
Slide TBD: Doing a Platter Swap for a Multi-Platter 
In order to do a Multi-Platter replacement you will need a special tool. If you have more 
than one platter and you take out the platters and any one of them turns at all, you will 
never get them aligned again or be able to read the data. This is because the data is 
written in a cylinder. Since the data is in a cylinder you must have the exact same 
alignment of the platters in order to move them to a new hard drive. 
There is a special tool called a Platter Replacement Stand. You can get one at 
SalvationData.com  http://www.salvationdata.com/productDetail.asp?pn=00013 for 
around $250 plus postage. It is a really heavy stand and weighs about 10 pounds.  The 
platter replacement tool is what you really need and it looks a lot like a coffee can with a 
slit in the side.  Once you have moved your heads out of the way, this can sits down 
around all the platters and you can push down on a piece of metal mounted in the slit to 
tighten it around the platters.  It also has a lid inside that sits on the top ring of the 
platters that will hold the screws and keep them from rolling around all over the platters.  
The pressure from the “coffee can” will hold all the platters together; however you still 
have to be really careful about taking it out and turning it. It should go straight from one 
hard drive to the other as quickly as possible with as little movement as possible.  This 
is the best possible way to keep the drive platters lined up. You will still reassemble the

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH INFORMATION AND NOTES  
Matching Serial Numbers on Hard Drives 
This link is where I keep track of documentation on how each hard drive needs to be 
matched for a working donor drive.  I get this any where I can, use it if you can, and if 
you happen to find something out please let me know so I can add it to the collection!   
NOTES: 
Drives with the same model number can still have different numbers of heads, therefore the 
board is different. It is possible to identify the number of heads in a drive: Maxtor, Quantum, 
Seagate from the serial numbers: 
REFIRBUSHED DRIVES 
REFIRBUSHIED drives cannot be used as a donor drive. Head 0 is the bottom head and could 
be bad. And substandard parts are often installed. It is very difficult to match a refirb drive to a 
good drive with the same problems. This also makes it difficult to make repair a refirb drive. 
QUANTUM 
Quantum – the third number in the serial number shows the heads 
Quantum = HA code must match 
SEAGATE 
Seagate – the third SYMBOL in serial number represents the heads.  
Seagate’s sometimes have extra heads and when one is refurbished it is possible to turn off a bad 
head and turn on an alternate one and then the firmware number revision might change. 
FUJITSU 
Fujtsu needs the first xx-Xxxx to match 
IBM and HITACHI DRIVES - Usually the same drive 
IBM MLC codes have to match 
HITACHI 
Hitachi ATMR 80gigs fails most 
Hitachi 3.5 – Firmware code needs to match 
Hitachi 2.5 – PCB rev has to match 
WESTERN DIGITAL DRIVES 
DCM codes for the (5th??? And) 6th numbers must match.

No Western Digital drives with the letter R in the code. EB and BB models. 
Western Digital Drives EB and BB have the head stack affixed from the lid.  
Western Digital the sixth char in the model is the cache. U = 2meg V=8meg 
SAMSUNG 
Samsung the 4th Char in the alpha code on the label on the rear side needs to match 
Samsung the 7th char in the model is the size of the buffer H=8megs 
MAXTOR DRIVES 
The second number of the serial number represents the number of heads Maxtor needs the 2nd 
and 3rd char to match: 
Hi you all, this is the answer I received directly from Maxtor  
Dear Mr. Robert,...  
here is the paragraph that deals with your model type 
(DiamondMax Plus 9):  
For the following Maxtor hard drive models: Fireball 3, 
DiamondMax 16, DiamondMax Plus 8, DiamondMax Plus 9, 
Diamond Max 10 and all MaxLine products there is also a GTLA 
Number on the model (next to barcode on the bottom of the drive). 
Format 1Y222J2223322. 1, 2 and 3 stand for numbers, Y and J for 
letters.  
The numbers 1 and 3 as well as the letter Y need to be identical to 
be able to replace the PCB on these drives.  
This number can be found on the large sticker on the top of the 
drive.  
Unfortunately we cannot give you any more information than this. 
Any of your DiamondMax Plus 9 drives could possibly have a 
matching PCB, however it is most likely to be an older one as the 
drive in question is almost 3 years old.  
Kind regards,

 Random Notes and Ideas For Data Recovery 
1. Drive goes to sleep, replace the board live 
2. Partitions start on Cylinder Boundaries 
3. Hard Drives have a Safe Mode 
4. You can fix LaCie problems with a Mac mounting them in the system 
5. Drives that you plug in that cause windows to Crash – Use Ubuntu to Read Files 
6. When problems with MFT then retry smaller blocks 
7. If drive parts are good then rewriting the SA area is the part that needs 
repairing. 
8. SA Code can be replaced to do data destruction or encryption 
9. If you are thinking of a hard drive as 0’s 1’s then you are wrong. The equipment 
interprets signals to make the representation of 0s or 1s. Designers have taken 
into account the signal distortion and interface problems to make the work. 
10. Remove a chip from the PCB and re-solder the chip onto a good board to fix 
specific problems with chips that are burned, cracked, etc. 
11. Soft resets on SATA also need to do a hard reset the controller as it cannot be 
reset any other way like the bus is reset in a PCI or ATA. 
12. ATA-3 Spec – hard drive read without retry was disabled and now is internal on 
the drive. 
13. Seagate Drives use a serial interface of which you can find online. It will show 
you stats on the drive. If you see FFFF mask FFFF mask it is a head error. 
14. If a drive is read with a standard read then it does not need to be read again but 
it might be good to use ECC to compare in a later pass. 
15. Force the drive to use PIO mode instead of DMA/UDMA modes. Some hard 
drive failures cause the drive to fail reading UDMA but might still work in PIO. 
16. Powers on good drive, while board is still in use move it to a new drive. Wrong 
defect tables and can be cleared. 
17. If the platters are misaligned you can write data over the servo wedge and 
thereby destroying any chance that you can ever read the data. 
18. As the thermal heat increases stability of the bits drop rapidly and with the 
addition of Areal density – degradation is much higher. There are fewer atoms in 
each bit to retain the bit orientation. Currently the drive will test for decay and if 
detected will automatically rewrite the data it detects. 
19. Hard drives stored in heat for long term storage is extremely bad. 
20. Adaptec ATA Raid 1200A Controller in combination with MHDD is great for 
recovery software. 
21. To determine if there is an HPA – Look at the LBA Maximum and if it is equal to 
Maximum Native LBA then there is no HPA. 
22. Partitions created using standard disk partitioning tools, fdisk, Windows Disk 
Management, Partition Magic, will all be cylinder aligned. You only have to scan 
cylinder boundaries for partitions. Dynamic disks do not use partition tables, 
they use LDM which is at the end of the disk and needs to be done backwards. 
It uses one single partition occupying the entire disk minus one cylinder. When 
volumes are added or deleted the partition table is not updated. There are only 
4 partitions possible with the standard Windows tools.

23. All partition table signatures end in 55 AA – if this is gone the OS will regard this 
as not existing. 80 is active 0B fat32 0F extended 
24. Everything in NTFS is a file - $boot 
25. Sector is the smallest addressable unit on the disk. You can read more than one 
sector but you cannot read less. 
26. If doing a head replacement try straws for head stack replacements around the 
heads to keep them protected. Cut off a small piece of a drinking straw and 
place it over the head area of each and every head.  
27. Even when the lower part of a head stack does not have heads they are still 
numbered.  
28. Increasing numbers of drive have no chance for parts replacement due to 
changes in the hardware. 
29. Some drives store the lists in the NV Ram on the PCB. The table on one drive 
will not match the table on another drive and are unique. That might cause the 
same logical blocks to be mapped to different physical blocks on different hard 
drives. It is possible to have a swapped board cause a space on the hard drive 
to be overwritten due to the mapping problem.
