**Examples:**

To create an event trace data collector named `trace_log`, using no fewer than 16 and no more than 256 buffers, with each buffer being 64KB in size, and saving the results to `c:\logfile`, use the following command:

```sh
logman create trace trace_log -nb 16 256 -bs 64 -o c:\logfile
```

This command sets up the specified parameters and creates the event trace data collector accordingly.
