      - Look for other error messages related to this SPA subslot to determine the root cause of the failure.

11. **SPA OIR Unrecognized Type**
    - **Message:** `The SPA of type 0x[hex] in [chars] is not recognized. The type of the SPA in the specified subslot is not recognized by the operating system. The operating system might not support this SPA type on this platform, or the SPA type identification stored on the SPA is invalid.`
    - **Description:** The SPA type in the specified subslot is not recognized by the operating system. This could be because the operating system does not support this SPA type on this platform, or the SPA type identification stored on the SPA is invalid.
    - **Action:**
      - Ensure that the system is running a version of the operating system that supports the SPA type specified in the error message on this platform.
      - If the correct operating system version is in use, copy the error message exactly as it appears on the console or in the system log, contact your Cisco technical support representative, and provide the representative with the gathered information. Include the information about the SPA type found on the front of the SPA.

12. **SPA OIR Unsupported Type**
    - **Message:** `The [chars] in [chars] is not supported by the [chars] module. The SPA in the subslot specified in the error message is not supported in the specified SIP by the version of the operating system currently running on the system. The SPA type may be supported by another SIP or by a later operating system release.`
    - **Description:** The SPA type in the specified subslot is not supported by the specified SIP with the current version of the operating system. The SPA type may be supported by another SIP or a later operating system release.
    - **Action:**
      - Ensure that the SIP specified in the error message supports the specified SPA type.
      - Ensure that the operating system release supports the SPA type in the SIP.
      - It may be necessary to upgrade your system to the latest operating system release in your release train or use a different SIP type.
      - If the SPA type specified in the error message does not match the interface types or numbers shown on the front of the SPA, copy the error message exactly as it appears on the console or in the system log, contact your Cisco technical support representative, and provide the representative with the gathered information. Include information regarding the SPA type found on the front of the SPA.
      - Ensure that the first [chars] which gives the SPA type matches the actual SPA type shown on the front of the SPA, indicating that the SPA type field read from the SPA's IDPROM is not incorrect or corrupted.
      - If the SPA type specified in the message is correct, the SIP type specified in the message is correct, and the operating system version running on the router is documented as supporting the specified SPA type in the specified SIP, this does not indicate a problem with either the SPA or SIP. It indicates that what is documented as supported is not actually supported by the software or there is a software error. Either issue should be easily reproducible.
      - If the SPA type shown on the front of the SPA does not match that specified in the message, the SPA will probably need an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) to have its IDPROM re-programmed or other corrective actions taken.
