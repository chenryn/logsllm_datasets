### 4.2.1 Whitelisted Fully Qualified Domains

The whitelist encompasses 3,545 fully qualified domains, including search engines (Microsoft, Yahoo, Google), commercial sales platforms (Walmart, Amazon), content publishers (Reddit, About.com, Cracked), and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Comcast and Time Warner, among others. Many of these fully qualified domains map to the same publisher. For example, the whitelist includes over 1,044 subdomains for about.com, such as cars.about.com and food.about.com. Additionally, there are 919 country-specific domains for Google properties, like google.co.uk and google.de.

Table 2 provides a breakdown of the fully qualified domains by their respective counts and Alexa rankings.

| **Alexa Partition** | **Fully Qualified Domains** | **Percentage** |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| All                 | 1,990                        | -               |
| Top 1,000,000       | 1,286 (0.12%)                | -               |
| Top 5,000           | 316 (6.32%)                  | -               |
| Top 1,000           | 167 (16.70%)                 | -               |
| Top 500             | 112 (22.40%)                 | -               |
| Top 100             | 33 (33.00%)                  | -               |

**Table 2: Domains explicitly included in the whitelist.** The whitelist contains restricted exception filters for 3,544 fully qualified publisher domains, corresponding to 1,990 effective second-level domains. Percentages are based on the total number of domains within each Alexa partition.

### 4.2.2 Unrestricted Exception Filters

Unrestricted exception filters apply to all first-party domains, meaning they can match any site. The whitelist uses unrestricted exceptions primarily for two purposes:

1. **Conversion Tracking**: These filters enable the tracking of user actions, such as whether an advertisement led to a purchase.
2. **Whitelisting Specific Ad Networks**: They allow specific ad networks to display advertisements across multiple domains without needing to explicitly list each domain in the whitelist.

For example, PageFair, an ad network involved in the Acceptable Ads program, uses the following unrestricted exception filters:

```plaintext
@@ || pagefair . net ^ $third - party
@@ || tracking . admarketplace . net ^ $third - party
@@ || imp . admarketplace . net ^ $third - party
```

These filters allow PageFair to show advertisements on any partnered website without needing a separate exception for each domain. PageFair takes a "minority share of the additional advertising revenue" that they provide to publishers and pays Eyeo to participate in the Acceptable Ads program.

Another example is Influenads, which uses similar unrestricted exceptions:

```plaintext
@@ || influads . com ^ $script , image
# @ ## influads_block
```

The second filter, an element exception, matches any element with the id `influads_block` on any site. This is the only example of an unrestricted element filter in the whitelist and may be an oversight by the authors.

In Section 5, we further explore the impact of the 156 unrestricted exception filters using a survey of popular domains.

### 4.2.3 Sitekey Exception Filters

A sitekey exception filter includes a DER-encoded, base-64 representation of an RSA public key. Adblock Plus allows advertisements on any domain that presents a valid signature signed with a current sitekey. Effectively, sitekeys delegate the task of whitelisting to the publisher.

Adblock Plus calculates the signature by signing a string containing the URI, hostname, and user-agent string of the HTTP request. It then compares the result with the signature returned in:
- The `X-Adblock-key` header of the HTTP response.
- The `data-adblockkey` attribute of the returned page.

The first sitekey, added to the whitelist before its release, belongs to Sedo, a domain parking and hosting company based in Cologne, Germany. Sedo's founder, Tim Schumacher, is also Eyeo’s chief investor and participated in the initial development of the Acceptable Ads program.

Currently, there are 4 sitekeys and 25 sitekey filters in the whitelist, all belonging to domain parking services. They are, in order of introduction:
- Sedo
- ParkingCrew
- Uniregistry
- Digimedia

A fifth sitekey (for Rook Media) was removed from the whitelist in September 2014.

Parked domains typically exist to show advertisements and sell domains, often in the form of links to pages related to the domain name. Misspellings of popular sites are also frequently parked. For example, reddit.cm is a parked domain that advertises dating services and photos of celebrities, and it is whitelisted under the Acceptable Ads program using a sitekey.

Using the top-level domain zone file for `.com` domains, we identified approximately 3 million parked domains managed by one of the parking services listed in Table 3. We focused on domains whose name servers belong to one of the sitekey parking services. For instance, Sedo domains use the `ns1.sedoparking.com` and `ns2.sedoparking.com` nameservers.

Table 3 provides a lower bound on the number of domains for each parking service.

| **Company**         | **Whitelisted Domains (.com)** | **Date Added**  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Sedo                | 1,060,129                       | 2011-11-30      |
| ParkingCrew         | 368,703                         | 2013-05-27      |
| RookMedia           | 949                             | 2013-07-31      |
| Uniregistry         | 1,246,359                       | 2013-09-25      |
| Digimedia           | 25                              | 2014-07-02      |

**Table 3: Domain statistics for the five parking services whitelisted by Adblock Plus.** RookMedia was removed from the whitelist on September 16, 2014 (revision 656); all others remain active.

### Factoring Sitekeys

All current sitekeys use 512-bit RSA keys (RSA-155). Such small key sizes are well within the factoring capabilities of an individual or publisher with modest hardware resources. To demonstrate this, we constructed a cluster comprising 8 desktop computers running Ubuntu 14.04, each with an Intel Xeon E5-2630 clocked at 2.30GHz and 32 GB of memory. We used the CADO-NFS implementation of the Number Field Sieve algorithm. This setup took approximately one week on average to factor each sitekey.

Figure 5 demonstrates how an adversarial publisher could use a factored sitekey to show intrusive or malicious advertising. Our proof of concept used Adblock Plus’s default settings with both the EasyList blacklist and the Acceptable Ads whitelist enabled. The figure shows our test site before and after adding the sitekey, bypassing all blocking filters.

### 5. Measuring Filter Behavior

Our previous analysis, focusing on the content of the whitelist, provides a necessary but incomplete picture of the whitelist's behavior. For instance, the whitelist includes an exception filter for PageFair advertisements but does not list the domains that use PageFair. Complicating matters, whitelist behavior also depends on various subtle factors, including filter ambiguity, unpredictable website behavior, and complex interactions between different filters and filter lists.

#### Methodology

We instrumented Adblock Plus to measure filter activations on domains drawn from four sample groups:
- The 5,000 most popular domains.
- 1,000 domains randomly sampled from the rank 5K–50K popularity strata.
- 1,000 domains randomly sampled from the rank 50K–100K popularity strata.
- 1,000 domains randomly sampled from the rank 100K–1M popularity strata.

We used Selenium to visit each domain and recorded filter activations. We surveyed only the landing page of each site, producing a lower bound on the number of matching filters as some filters require user interaction to activate.

Figure 6 shows the filter activations on the top 50 sites with at least one filter activation. The number and type of filter matches are shown by the height and color of the bars, respectively. Domains explicitly included in the whitelist are shown in bold along the x-axis.

This figure illustrates several issues when measuring filter behavior:
- 12 domains not explicitly included in the whitelist nevertheless activate whitelist filters, e.g., youtube.com.
- Some whitelist filters activate needlessly, matching content that would not have otherwise been blocked by the EasyList blacklist.
- Sites may behave differently based on browser state and configuration. For example, ask.com will activate more filters if the user does not have specific cookies in the browser cache.
- Some sites will show different advertisements if they detect the presence of Adblock Plus, e.g., imgur.com.
- Not all whitelist filters are directly responsible for displaying advertisements, e.g., gstatic exceptions. Many common exceptions are for conversion tracking and do not visually impact the website.

These results suggest the need for more complex analysis techniques to fully characterize the whitelist’s behavior, which we leave for future work.

### 5.1 Active Filters on the Top 5K Domains

Of the Top 5,000 domains, 3,956 activated at least one Adblock Plus filter from either the EasyList blacklist or the Acceptable Ads whitelist. The remaining 1,044 domains were largely non-English (and thus out of the purview of EasyList) or required additional user interaction to trigger filters, e.g., logins, search queries, etc.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of the total and distinct whitelist filter matches per surveyed site, including only domains with at least one whitelist filter activation (2,934 sites). Toyota.com saw the most filter activations with 83 total matches for 8 distinct filters. 5% of the surveyed sites activated at least 12 exception filters (non-distinct), and, on average, each site activated 2.6 distinct whitelist filters.

### 5.2 Filter Activations Across Categories

Figure 8 shows the number of filters triggered by domains in each group. The top portion shows categorical filter activation frequencies, while the lower portion shows filter activation frequency by domain category.

Table 4 displays the 20 most common whitelist exception filters in the Top 5,000 group. As expected, all of these filters are unrestricted, allowing them to trigger on any site.
