crosoft, Yahoo, Google), commercial sales (Walmart, Amazon),
content publishers (Reddit, About.com, Cracked), and ISPs (Com-
cast, Time Warner), amongst others. Many of the fully qualiﬁed
domains appearing in the whitelist map to the same publisher. For in-
stance, the whitelist includes over 1,044 subdomains for about.com,
including cars.about.com and food.about.com. Additionally,
there are 919 country-based domains for Google properties included
in the whitelist, e.g., google.co.uk and google.de. Table 2 shows
the respective count and Alexa rankings for fully qualiﬁed domains.
4.2.2 Unrestricted Exception Filters
An unrestricted exception ﬁlter applies to all ﬁrst-party domains,
i.e., these exceptions can match on any site. The whitelist uses
unrestricted exceptions primarily for two purposes. First, many
of these ﬁlters enable conversion tracking. Broadly, conversion
tracking is used to measure if an advertisement resulted in some
user action, e.g., user purchased the product after clicking on the ad.
Second, unrestricted ﬁlters are used to whitelist speciﬁc ad networks.

Table 2: Domains explicitly included in the whitelist. The whitelist con-
tains restricted exception ﬁlters for 3,544 fully qualiﬁed publisher domains.
This corresponds to 1,990 effective second-level domains, e.g., google.com
is the effective second-level domain of maps.google.com. Percentages are
on the total number of domains within the particular Alexa partition.
This practice allows the ad network to show advertisements across
multiple domains without having to explicitly include these domain
in the whitelist. PageFair is an example of the latter.
PageFair. While PageFair is oft-quoted for their reports on the
prevalence of ad blocking and its monetary costs—in fact, we cite
one in the introduction—the company is also an ad network involved
in the Acceptable Ads program.13

These unrestricted exception ﬁlters allow PageFair to show adver-

ception for each domain. The company takes a “minority share
of the additional advertising revenue” that they provide publish-
ers. PageFair also pays Eyeo to participate in the Acceptable Ads
program.
Another advertising network, Inﬂuads, has similar unrestricted
exceptions.

The second of these ﬁlters—an element exception—is not actually
limited to Inﬂuads advertisements; instead, this ﬁlter will match any
element on any site as long as the element’s id is influads_block.
This is the only example of an unrestricted element ﬁlter in the
whitelist, and possibly an oversight by the whitelist’s authors.
In Section 5, we further explore the impact of the 156 unrestricted
exception ﬁlters using a survey of popular domains.
4.2.3 Sitekey Exception Filters
A sitekey exception ﬁlter includes a DER-encoded, base-64 repre-
sentation of an RSA public key.

Adblock Plus allows advertisements on any domain that presents a
valid signature signed with a current sitekey. Effectively, sitekeys
delegate the task of whitelisting to the publisher.
Adblock Plus calculates the signature by signing a string contain-
ing the URI, hostname, and user-agent string of the HTTP request.
Adblock Plus then compares the result with the signature returned by
the server in: (i) the X-Adblock-key header of the HTTP response,
and (ii) the data-adblockkey attribute of the returned page.
The ﬁrst sitekey—added to the whitelist before its release—belongs
to Sedo, a domain parking and hosting company based in Cologne,

Germany (the same city as Eyeo). The company’s founder, Tim
Schumacher, is also Eyeo’s chief investor and participated in the
initial development of the Acceptable Ads program [24].
Currently, there are 4 sitekeys and 25 sitekey ﬁlters in the whitelist,
all belonging to domain parking services. They are, in order of
introduction, Sedo, ParkingCrew, Uniregistry, and Digimedia. A
ﬁfth sitekey (for Rook Media) was removed from the whitelist in
Sept. 2014.
Parked domains typically exist to show advertisements (and sell
domains), usually in the form of links to pages related to the domain
name. Misspellings of popular sites are also frequently parked.
For example, reddit.cm is a parked domain that advertises dating
services and photos of celebrities; this domain is whitelisted under
the Acceptable Ads program using a sitekey. For a more complete
treatment of domain parking, see the recent work by Alrwais et
al. [4].
Using the top-level domain zone ﬁle for .com domains, we
identiﬁed approximately 3 million parked domains managed by
one of the parking services listed in Table 3. Speciﬁcally, we
focused on those domains whose name servers belong to one of
the sitekey parking services. For example, Sedo domains use the
ns1.sedoparking.com and ns2.sedoparking.com nameservers.
The list of parking name servers, in part, was derived from the exam-
ple sites given in Adblock Plus online forums. We used automated
tools to visit each suspected domain and only recorded those that
presented a sitekey signature.
Table 3 provides a lower bound on the number of domains for

account for at least 2,676,165 distinct whitelisted domains.
Finally, some of the above sites required special accommodations
to scrape. For example, ParkingCrew domains employ countermea-
sures to prevent scraping, returning a 403 response if the user-agent
string matches that of a tool like curl. Further, some domains, e.g.,
Uniregistry, behave differently given the presence or absence of
speciﬁc cookie values. For instance, when a user visits a Unireg-
istry domain for the ﬁrst time, the site will return a page that ﬁrst
generates a cookie and then redirects the user to another page with
advertisements (and the sitekey signature).
Factoring Sitekeys. All current sitekeys use 512 bit RSA keys
(RSA-155). Such small key sizes are well within the factoring
capabilities of an individual or publisher with modest hardware
resources. To demonstrate this, we constructed a cluster comprising
8 desktop computers running Ubuntu 14.04, each with an Intel Xeon
E5-2630 clocked at 2.30GHz and 32 GB of memory. We used the
CADO-NFS14 implementation of the Number Field Sieve algorithm.
This setup took approximately one week on average to factor each
sitekey.
In Figure 5, we demonstrate how an adversarial publisher could
use a factored sitekey to show intrusive or malicious advertising.

Figure 5: Exploiting sitekeys. Using a cluster of desktop computers, we were able to factor one of the whitelist sitekeys in ﬁve days. The derived key allowed
our test site to bypass Adblock Plus’s blocking entirely.
For our proof of concept, we used Adblock Plus’s default settings
with both the EasyList blacklist and the Acceptable Ads whitelist
enabled. The ﬁgure shows our test site before and after adding the
sitekey. In short, our test site bypassed all blocking ﬁlters.
5. MEASURING FILTER BEHAVIOR
Our previous analysis—focusing on the content of the whitelist—
provides a necessary but incomplete picture of the whitelist’s be-
havior. For instance, the whitelist includes an exception ﬁlter for
PageFair advertisements, but it does not list any of the domains that
use PageFair.
Complicating matters, whitelist behavior also depends on a myr-
iad of more subtle factors including ﬁlter ambiguity, unpredictable
website behavior, and complex interactions between different ﬁlters
and ﬁlter lists. In this Section, we expand on our previous analysis
using empirical measurements of ﬁlter activation.
Methodology. We instrument Adblock Plus to measure ﬁlter activa-
tions on domains drawn from four sample groups: (i) the 5,000 most
popular domains,15 (ii) 1,000 domains randomly sampled from the
rank 5K–50K popularity strata, (iii) 1,000 domains randomly sam-
pled from the rank 50K–100K popularity strata, (iv) 1,000 domains
randomly sampled from the rank 100K–1M popularity strata.
We instrumented Adblock Plus to record ﬁlter activations and
used Selenium16 to visit each domain. We surveyed only the landing
page of each site. By limiting our visit to the ﬁrst page, our survey
produces a lower bound on the number of matching ﬁlters as some
ﬁlters will not activate without user interaction. For instance, Google
search ads only appear after a search.
Figure 6 shows the ﬁlter activations on the top 50 sites with at
least one ﬁlter activation. We show the number and type of ﬁlter

matches by the height and color of the bars, respectively. Domains
explicitly included in the whitelist are shown in bold along the
x-axis.
This ﬁgure illustrates a number of subtle issues when measur-
ing ﬁlter behavior. First, 12 domains not explicitly included in
the whitelist nevertheless activate whitelist ﬁlters, e.g., youtube.
com. Second, whitelist ﬁlters activate needlessly. That is, the ﬁlter
matches content that would not have otherwise been blocked by the
EasyList blacklist. Third, sites may behave differently based on
browser state and conﬁguration. For example, ask.com will activate
more ﬁlters if the user does not have speciﬁc cookies in the browser
cache. Further, some sites will show different advertisements if the
sites detects the presence of Adblock Plus, e.g., imgur.com.
Finally, not all whitelist ﬁlters are directly responsible for dis-
playing advertisements, e.g., gstatic exceptions. Many common
exceptions are for conversion tracking and do not visually impact
the website.
These results suggests the need for more complex analysis tech-
niques to fully characterize the whitelist’s behavior. We leave such
explorations for future work.
5.1 Active Filters on the Top 5K Domains
Of the Top 5,000 domains, 3,956 activated at least one Adblock
Plus ﬁlter from either the EasyList blacklist or the Acceptable Ads
whitelist. The remaining 1,044 domains were largely non-English
(and thus out of the purview of Easylist) or required additional user
interaction to trigger ﬁlters, e.g., logins, search queries, etc.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of the total and distinct whitelist
ﬁlter matches per surveyed site. We include only domains with at
least one whitelist ﬁlter activation (2,934 sites). Toyota.com saw
the most ﬁlter activations with 83 total matches for 8 distinct ﬁlters,
5% of the surveyed sites activated at least 12 exception ﬁlters (non-
distinct), and, on average, each site activated 2.6 distinct whitelist
ﬁlters.

Table 4: Most common whitelist ﬁlters in the survey. This table displays the 20 most common exception ﬁlters from our survey of Alexa’s top 5,000 websites.
Number 9 on this list was added without community vetting; it allows Google’s AdSense for search on nearly all domains.
Table 4 shows the 20 most common whitelist exception ﬁlters in
the Top 5,000 group. As expected, all of these ﬁlters are unrestricted.
As we discussed previously, unrestricted ﬁlters can trigger on any
site.
The most activated ﬁlter, @@||stats.g.doubleclick.net^
$script,image, triggered on 1,559 domains (31.2%). This ﬁlter
is used to allows conversion tracking. The second-most popular ﬁl-
ter, @@||googleadservices.com^$third-party, was observed
on 1,535 domains, and allows advertisements from Google’s Ad-
Sense network. The third-most popular ﬁlter, @@||gstatic.com
^$third-party, occurred on 1,282 domains. This ﬁlter does not
appear to contribute to the visibility of advertisements. Instead,
the Google-owned gstatic.com serves fonts, scripts, images, and
other resources to sites to increase browsing performance. The
necessity of the gstatic.com ﬁlter is unclear to us, given that Ea-
syList does not currently contain any ﬁlters that would block the
observed gstatic.com requests.
We observed one unrestricted element exception ﬁlter, #@##
influads_block, which activated on 30 different domains. As
discussed in Section 4.2.2, this ﬁlter prevents the blocking of con-
tent contained within any element with an id of influads_block.
