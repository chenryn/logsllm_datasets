Question: Why should a web application not rely solely on a fast cryptographic hash function like SHA256 for password hashing, despite its efficiency?
"A": "Fast hash functions like SHA256 make it easier for attackers to perform offline password guessing attacks due to their computational speed.",
"B": "SHA256 is outdated and no longer considered secure due to recent advancements in hash function design.",
"C": "Using fast hash functions like SHA256 increases the time needed for the server to authenticate users, creating a bottleneck.",
"D": "Fast cryptographic hash functions like SHA256 are incompatible with modern password storage requirements and cannot be used with salts."
Answer: A
