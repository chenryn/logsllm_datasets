User: What measures, both hardware and software, are in place to prevent data loss?
Assistant: Hardware: 1. RAID technology: Multiple hard disks form a RAID array to achieve data backup and fault tolerance. 2. Hard disk redundancy backup: backup data in physical hard disk or data center to avoid data loss caused by single hard disk damage. 3. Data backup: copy data to different places to avoid data loss caused by failure of a single storage medium. Software: 1. Data backup: regularly back up data to different places. 2. Periodically check data integrity: Check that data is not corrupted or missing, and that file systems or databases are functioning correctly. 3. Update the software and operating system in time: upgrade the software and operating system in time to avoid vulnerabilities being attacked and resulting in data loss.
