I encountered errors while attempting to install `fabric` or `paramiko` using `pip`, which resulted in a `RuntimeError: chmod error` during the installation of `pycrypto`.

Is there a way to establish an SSH connection from within a QPython script?

**Response:**

To use `paramiko` and its dependencies, such as `cryptography`, you need a compiler to build these modules. Unfortunately, this is not included in the QPython environment. The best approach would be to use a cross-compiler to build the necessary modules yourself. However, I have not found any pre-built modules for QPython that support `ssh` or `paramiko`.

### Alternative Solutions:
1. **BusyBox/SSH or Dropbear**: You might consider using alternative libraries like `BusyBox` with `ssh` or `Dropbear` for ARM-based systems.
2. **QPython Pre-installed Modules**: Upon further investigation, I noticed that both `OpenSSL` and `SSH` are pre-installed in QPython. You do not need to install them separately.

However, the `Crypto` module (which is a dependency for `paramiko`) is still causing issues. Without the `Crypto` module, the functionality of the `ssh` module may be limited.

### Update:
I tried using the Qpypi library manager and found `cryptography` listed. However, when I attempted to install it, the process failed. It seems quite challenging to get SSH working with QPython due to these dependency issues.

If you have any other suggestions or workarounds, please let me know.
