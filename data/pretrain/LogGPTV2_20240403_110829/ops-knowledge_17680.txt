Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of an instance being spawned on a hypervisor. It begins with multiple GET requests to the server, followed by the instance being checked and the active base files being identified. The instance is then plugged into the network and resumed, and it takes 20.83 seconds to build the instance. Finally, there is another GET request to the server.
