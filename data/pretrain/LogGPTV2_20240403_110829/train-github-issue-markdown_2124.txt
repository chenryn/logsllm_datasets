# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Similar to the pipline of a screen GIF recorder I would like to request a
screen video recorder. It should let us either record the whole screen or a
customizable area. It also should have an option to record the sound or not.
Everything else such as customizable FPS / codec, locking to an application
window etc. is optional.
