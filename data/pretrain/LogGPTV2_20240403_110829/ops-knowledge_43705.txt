Question: A security analyst performs a network scan to identify potentially vulnerable services on a web server. The output below shows the services running on the target IP address:

bash
PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
80/tcp    open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.29
443/tcp   open  ssl/http    nginx 1.14.0
3306/tcp  open  mysql       MySQL 5.7.22-0ubuntu0.17.10.1
8080/tcp  open  http-proxy  Squid http proxy 3.5.27

Based on this output, which of the following actions should the analyst prioritize to mitigate potential security risks?
"A": "Verify the Squid http proxy configuration on port 8080 to ensure it is not allowing anonymous access.",
"B": "Ignore the Apache server on port 80 as it is running on the standard HTTP port and poses no risk.",
"C": "Focus on the MySQL service on port 3306 as it is not a web service and can be secured later.",
"D": "Inspect the nginx server on port 443 as it is using SSL and therefore secure by default."
Answer: A
