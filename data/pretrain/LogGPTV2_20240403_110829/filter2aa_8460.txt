# Robots Rule
Web, 100 points
## Description:
A website was linked to.
```html
		DOWN WITH ROBOTS!
		HUMANS ARE THE BEST!
```
## Solution:
The title is a pretty thick hint to go check out `robots.txt`:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/Robots_Rule# curl http://web5.tamuctf.com/robots.txt
User-agent: *
WHAT IS UP, MY FELLOW HUMAN!
HAVE YOU RECEIVED SECRET INFORMATION ON THE DASTARDLY GOOGLE ROBOTS?!
YOU CAN TELL ME, A FELLOW NOT-A-ROBOT!
```
The whole theme of the site is too anti-robot-pro-human. They also mention Google-Bot. What will happen if we try to access the site as a Google Bot instead, will we still get such anti-robot propaganda?
```console
root@kali:~# curl -A "Googlebot" http://web5.tamuctf.com/robots.txt
User-agent: *
THE HUMANS SUSPECT NOTHING!
HERE IS THE SECRET INFORMATION: gigem{be3p-bOop_rob0tz_4-lyfe}
LONG LIVE THE GOOGLEBOTS!
```
