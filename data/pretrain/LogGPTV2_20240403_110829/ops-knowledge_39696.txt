Question: You are evaluating the security of a newly developed iOS application that utilizes WebViews to display content. The application uses `WKWebView` for rendering web content and has implemented a JavaScript bridge for communication between the web content and the native Swift code. During your assessment, which of the following methods would you consider as a secure approach to enable communication from JavaScript to the native application environment?
"A": "Allowing direct reference to the `JSContext` of a `WKWebView` to enable JavaScript to call native Swift functions directly.",
"B": "Using the `add(_ scriptMessageHandler:name:)` method to set up a message handler that allows JavaScript to send messages to the native app.",
"C": "Implementing a custom `JSExport`-inherited protocol to map JavaScript objects directly to native Swift objects.",
"D": "Enabling the `get-task-allowed` entitlement on the app to inspect the contents of the WebView and facilitate communication."
Answer: B
