Table 1: Protocols we analyzed. Protocols are grouped according to the evolv-
ability scenarios most suited to them. Any protocol could be deployed as a
custom protocol. Extra information that must be disseminated in the control
plane is denoted by⋆ and support needed in the data plane by◇. A PV in-
dicates path vector and LS indicates link state. A ” indicates that a column
inherits from the corresponding entry in the previous row. HLP’s link-state
functionality can only be deployed within islands.
Routing compliance can be increased by tunneling traffic to force
it to travel through a specific sequence of islands. But, tunnels come
with significant drawbacks—they interfere with gulf ASes’ routing
decisions and use up extra addresses. Therefore, their use should be
optional and depend on how sensitive a given protocol is to reduced
compliance.
2.2 Baseline→ baseline with critical fix
The goal of this scenario is to deploy modified versions of the baseline
that incorporate various critical fixes. Critical fixes extend the baseline
by disseminating extra control information to improve path selection
or the protocol itself. Examples of critical fixes to today’s baseline, BGP,
include Wiser [32] for fixing BGP’s lack of support for limiting ingress
traffic at ASes [18], EQ-BGP [6] for adding generic QoS information
to routing paths, and BGPSec [8], for fixing BGP’s susceptibility to
route hijacking [47].
Data-plane support: Tunneling traffic to increase routing com-
pliance is optional and depends on the needs of the protocol. Multi-
network-protocol headers are not needed because critical fixes use
the same network protocol as the baseline.
Example: Figure 1 illustrates an Internet in which some islands
have deployed Wiser [32]. Wiser fixes BGP’s inability to help ASes
limit ingress traffic by disseminating an extra path cost in advertise-
ments, which influences path selection. Upgraded ASes add their

internal costs of routing traffic to the path costs they receive before
selecting the one with the lowest cost. Cheating ASes can add abnor-
mally high internal costs to prevent paths that include them from
being selected. Wiser prevents this by using two-way communication
to periodically exchange the total costs of paths neighbors receive
from each other. It uses this data to scale the path costs an AS receives
from a neighbor to be comparable to the path costs it advertises to
that neighbor. It then adds the AS’s internal costs and selects paths.
Since BGP requires neighbors to use the same routing protocol to
create paths, the two ASes at the edge of the large Wiser island, E1
and E2, must use BGP to advertise paths to a destination (D) to ASes
in the BGP gulf. Lines show paths advertised and arrows show the
direction of the advertisement. This creates two problems. First, a
potential source (S), which supports Wiser, cannot see Wiser’s path
costs. Second, because S, E1, and E2 are now separated by a gulf, they
cannot exchange the cost of paths they receive from one another to
compute scaling factors (assume S is also advertising paths, which
we do not show). As a result of these issues, S must use BGP to select
paths, which means it will choose the shortest path (due to BGP’s
path-selection algorithm), which has the highest path cost.
Incentives for deployment: ASes will be incentivized to deploy
a critical fix if the benefits afforded by that protocol can be realized
quickly. These benefits will increase incrementally as a function of
the protocol and the number of islands that can route traffic among
themselves using it.
Gulf ASes that do not plan to upgrade soon will have no incentive
not to support this scenario if doing so does not interfere with their
routing decisions and/or increase their costs. Islands can mitigate
potential for interference by avoiding using tunnels. They could also
give gulf ASes additional visibility and control by exposing critical
fixes’ control information to them. For example, with this knowledge,
gulf ASes’ operators could filter paths that use problematic protocols.
They might also be able to use knowledge of what protocols are used
on paths to debug problems.
Requirements: As the example above shows, without establishing
overlays and tunneling traffic, islands that deploy critical fixes can-
not discover one another. They also cannot disseminate critical fixes’

control information among themselves (this would also enable dis-
covery). Overlays and tunnels can be made optional for evolvability
by evolvability features that meet the following requirement:
CF-R1 Disseminate critical fixes’ control information across gulfs.
Critical fixes’ control information could be disseminated across
gulfs in two ways. It could be disseminated in-band of the baseline by
including it within baseline advertisements. This would expose new
protocols’ control information to gulf ASes and allow the baseline to
be seamlessly updated. But, it would also result in larger advertise-
ment sizes.
Critical fixes’ control information could also be disseminated out-
of-band of the baseline’s advertisements via existing baseline paths.
This requires establishing a minimal correspondence between critical
fixes’ control information relevant to a path and the baseline adver-
tisement for that path. This approach would not inflate advertisement
sizes, but would hide information from gulf ASes. Also, compared
to the in-band approach, it will suffer from an additional constant
performance penalty due to the overhead of external accesses on the
critical path of advertisement processing.
To allow the baseline to be seamlessly updated and to avoid disin-
centivizing gulf ASes, we require disseminating critical fixes’ control
information in-band whenever possible. Therefore, we introduce the
following requirement for our evolvability features:
CF-R2 Disseminate critical fixes’ control information in-band of the
baseline’s advertisements.
2.3 Baseline→ baseline // custom protocol
The goal of this scenario is to allow islands to deploy new protocols in
parallel (//) with the baseline. These new protocols are used to route
selected traffic, while the baseline is used for the rest. New protocols
can be custom-made by the island and there is no expectation that
they will be globally adopted. This scenario enables islands to sell
value-added services to other customers (e.g., other islands or end
users). Examples include selling alternate paths from BGP’s single
path [1,36,60], providing a VPN service, and selling access to some
non-baseline protocol (e.g., any of the ones considered in this paper).
Data-plane support: Routing compliance is needed because cus-
tom protocols’ traffic must reach specific islands (e.g., an island whose
value-added service(s) a customer has purchased). Multi-network-
protocol headers may be needed if islands use different network
protocols than the baseline.
Example: Figure 2 shows a transit island (marked T) that wishes
to avoid the single poorly performing path advertised by BGP (the
dashed path) to a destination (D). An island that supports MIRO [60]
(marked M) offers alternate paths for payment. But, BGP does not
facilitate discovery of islands’ custom services or how they must
coordinate out-of-band to exchange control information. For MIRO,
this information includes the alternate paths offered, the payment
required to use a given path, and the tunnel address that must be used
to route traffic along the chosen path. Island T remains ignorant of
Island M. Though the example shown is about off-path discovery (i.e.,
Island M is not on routing paths to the destination (D) advertised to
Island T), BGP also does not support on-path discovery (i.e., Island
M is on routing paths to the destination (D) advertised to Island T).
Figure 2: T cannot discover the MIRO service.
This limits Island M’s potential customers to only its direct neighbors.
Island M could use a web site for discovery, but it may go unnoticed.
Incentives for deployment: Islands that deploy custom protocols
do so to sell value-added services. Gulf ASes may be incentivized to
support custom-protocol deployments because they themselves may
wish to sell such services in the future.
Requirements: To support this scenario, islands supporting cus-
tom protocols must be able to discover each other using the evolv-
ability features. Thus, we have:
CP-R3 Facilitate across-gulf discovery of islands running custom pro-
tocols and how to negotiate use of their services.
2.4 Baseline→ replacement protocol
The goal of this evolvability scenario is to allow new protocols that are
radically different from the baseline to completely replace it within
islands or Internet wide. Unlike the previous scenario, a given new
protocol is used to forward all traffic within its islands. This is a
very aggressive scenario and likely to be only attractive if there are
strong incentives or requirements that are impossible to meet with
the baseline or its critical fixes.
Protocols apt for this scenario are ones that use different network
protocols compared to the baseline. One set of examples include
path-based routing protocols, such as SCION [63], which expose
multiple paths to sources and allow them to encode which ones they
want to use in packet headers. Another set of examples include multi-
hop protocols, such as Pathlet routing [21], which allow islands to
expose intra-island path fragments or pathlets. These pathlets can be
combined by other islands into larger pathlets or end-to-end paths.
Sources can pick which pathlets they want to use by encoding them
in packet headers.
Data-plane support: Tunneling traffic to increase routing com-
pliance is optional and depends on the needs of the protocol. Multi-
network-protocol headers are needed to cross gulfs.
Example: Figure 3 illustrates a scenario in which BGP is being
replaced by SCION [63], a path-based protocol. In this case, the right-
most SCION island in the diagram exposes two paths to a destination
(D). To provide basic connectivity, it redistributes [30] one SCION
path into BGP. However, the second path cannot be redistributed and
is lost because BGP is designed to operate a less-advanced network

SIGCOMM ’17, August 21–25, 2017, Los Angeles, CA, USA
3 DESIGN OF D-BGP
This section and the following ones seek to understand how our evolv-
ability features can be incorporated into an existing inter-domain
routing protocol and the difficulty/utility of doing so. We incorpo-
rated the features into BGPv4 [44], today’s baseline, because it is
a logical starting point for any evolvability efforts related to inter-
domain routing. This section describes the design of Darwin’s BGP
(D-BGP), a version of BGPv4 minimally extended with pass-through
support and a multi-protocol data structure in advertisements. D-
BGP can be used by ASes with distributed control (i.e., those that use
individual routers as BGP speakers) or centralized control (i.e., those
that use centralized BGP speakers [15, 46]). It requires data-plane
support, similar to that used by MPLS [3] and Arrow [36], to support
multi-network-protocol headers.
Incorporating the evolvability features make D-BGP’s advertise-
ments a shared container that can carry multiple inter-domain routing
protocols’ control information, including BGP. These advertisements
are carried across gulfs by the path-selection choices of the ASes
within them. Because D-BGP’s advertisements are now shared among
multiple inter-domain routing protocols, we need to redefine the term
critical fixes to specifically refer to changes to BGP’s path-selection
algorithm and control information. To demonstrate D-BGP’s utility
in bootstrapping evolution to new protocols, we assume it is the base-
line and that IPv4 is the baseline address format in this section. Later
sections discuss challenges involved in implementing D-BGP and
the evolvability benefits it can provide when it is the baseline.
Our experiences indicate that using BGPv4 as the starting point
to incorporate our evolvability features provides significant benefits.
But, because our features rely on an existing inter-domain routing
protocol to bootstrap deployment of new protocols, the former’s
limitations can limit the latter’s benefits. At the end of this section, we
discuss how BGP’s limitations can reduce new protocols’ benefits and
how these issues can be mitigated by using a more advanced protocol
as the starting point.
3.1 Assumptions
To prevent conflicts, we assume that all new protocols will be assigned
unique IDs by a governing body, such as the IETF [26] or ARIN [2].
These governing bodies could also assign islands unique IDs. Alter-
natively, islands could create island IDs themselves by hashing the
AS numbers of their border ASes. For clarity, we use protocol names
for protocol IDs, letters for island IDs, and numbers for existing AS
numbers. We use singleton islands’ existing AS numbers as their
island IDs. To prevent a proliferation of (potentially buggy) new pro-
tocols that aim to succeed the baseline, we assume that critical fixes
and replacement protocols that aim to do so will be ratified by the
governing body.
We assume that all new protocols will use path vectors when com-
municating across islands, as our evolvability features require that
they use the same loop-detection mechanism as the existing baseline.
Islands could use non-path-vector protocols internally. For exam-
ple, they could use custom protocols that are based on link-state.
Alternatively, they could use a replacement protocol that uses link-
state for intra-island communication and path vector for inter-island
communication [53].
Figure 3: S cannot be advertised both paths to D.
protocol than SCION and thus supports advertising only one path
per router.
Incentives for deployment: Identical to critical fixes.
