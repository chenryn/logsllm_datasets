Abstract
Inspired by unidirectional error detecting codes that are
used in situations where only one kind of bit errors are pos-
sible (e.g., it is possible to change a bit “0” into a bit “1”,
but not the contrary), we propose integrity codes (I-codes)
for a radio communication channel, which enable integrity
protection of messages exchanged between entities that do
not hold any mutual authentication material (i.e. public
keys or shared secret keys).
The construction of I-codes enables a sender to encode
any message such that if its integrity is violated in trans-
mission over a radio channel, the receiver is able to detect
it. In order to achieve this, we rely on the physical prop-
erties of the radio channel. We analyze in detail the use of
I-codes on a radio communication channel and we present
their implementation on a Mica2 wireless sensor platform
as a “proof of concept”. We ﬁnally introduce a novel con-
cept called “authentication through presence” that can be
used for several applications, including for key establish-
ment and for broadcast authentication over an insecure ra-
dio channel. We perform a detailed analysis of the security
of our coding scheme and we show that it is secure with
respect to a realistic attacker model.
1. Introduction
Conventional security goals like message conﬁdential-
ity, integrity, and authentication are traditionally achieved
through the use of certiﬁed public-keys or shared secret
keys, and by the application of appropriate cryptographic
primitives (i.e., encryption schemes, signatures, message
authentication codes, etc.).

In this paper, we propose I-codes, a new security prim-
itive that enables integrity protection of the messages ex-
changed between entities that do not hold any shared se-
crets or mutual authentication material (i.e. public keys or
shared secret keys). The construction of I-codes enables a
sender to encode any message, such that if its integrity is
violated in transmission, the receiver is able to detect it. In
the literature such codes are known as All-Unidirectional
Error-Detecting codes and are used in situations where it is
possible to change, for example, a bit “0” into a bit “1” but
the contrary is not possible (except with a negligible prob-
ability) [5, 7, 6]. An all-unidirectional error-detecting code
is able to detect any number of unidirectional errors in the
given codeword; in other words, for a given error-detection
code, no unidirectional error can transform a (valid) code-
word into another (valid) codeword. Unidirectional error-
detecting codes ﬁnd application, for example, in the encod-
ing of unchangeable data on digital optical disks [13].
Our main goal in this study is to propose a mechanism
to protect the integrity of messages exchanged between en-
tities in the presence of an adversary who tries to convince
the entities to accept modiﬁed messages as being authen-
tic. We do not attempt to increase the reliability of message
transmission – actually, as we will see shortly, we will have
to sacriﬁce the reliability of message transfer in order to
achieve our goal. For these reasons, we ﬁnd it appropri-
ate to call the error-detecting codes simply integrity codes
(I-codes).
Our approach to message integrity protection involves
three main components: on-off keying, signal anti-blocking
and I-coding. On-off keying is a modulation by which the
bit “1” is transmitted on the channel as the presence of a
signal and the bit “0” is transmitted as the absence of a sig-
nal. Signal anti-blocking means that the energy of the signal
(bit “1”) cannot be annihilated by an adversary (we show

several ways how to ensure this). Finally, by I-coding we
mean that a message is encoded using I-codes (described in
Section 3) before its transmission over an insecure channel.
With these three components, we can ensure that only
bits “0” (but not bits “1”) can be ﬂipped by the adversary
on the channel and that if a bit is ﬂipped, this will be de-
tected at the receiver, which is guaranteed by the properties
of I-codes (Section 3).
To validate our concept, we implement and test I-codes,
on-off keying and signal anti-blocking components on the
Mica2 wireless sensor network platform; our implementa-
tion demonstrates that the approach based on I-codes can be
implemented using existing radio and processing hardware
and protocols at virtually no extra cost. Ensuring integrity
protection over insecure radio channels is particulary im-
portant for preventing “man-in-the-middle”-based attacks,
which could otherwise be perpetrated on the radio channel.
By taking advantage of the characteristics of the radio chan-
nel, the I-codes help to completely prevent this attack.
Using I-codes, we develop a novel concept called au-
thentication through presence, which enables message au-
thentication based solely on the awareness of presence in
the power range of an entity. We show the application
of authentication through presence in two examples: (1)
IEEE 802.11 access point authentication, and (2) key es-
tablishment over insecure radio channels.
We perform a detailed analysis of the security of I-codes
on a radio channel and we show that they are secure assum-
ing a realistic attacker model. This analysis takes into ac-
count the characteristics of the radio channel such as phase
shifts, noise, and the attackers ability to detect, jam and alter
the messages on the channel.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we state
our problem and we describe our system and the attacker
model.
In Section 3, we formally introduce I-codes and
we provide details about their properties. In Section 4, we
present the results of the I-codes implementation. In Sec-
tion 5, we show how to use I-codes for authentication. In
Section 6, we present the security analysis of I-codes. In
Section 7 we describe the related work. Finally, we con-
clude the paper in Section 8.
2 Problem Statement and Assumptions
We observe the following problem: Assuming that two
entities (A and B) share a common (radio) communication
channel, but do not share any secrets or authentication ma-
terial (e.g., shared keys or authenticated public keys), how
can the messages exchanged between these entities be au-
thenticated and how can their integrity be preserved in the
presence of an attacker (M)? Here, by message integrity,
we mean that the message must be protected against any
malicious modiﬁcation, and by message authentication we
mean that it should be clear who the sender of the message
is.
We assume that the two entities involved in the commu-
nication (A and B) do trust each other; otherwise, little can
be done. Whenever we speak of the security of a given pro-
tocol, we implicitly assume that the entities involved in the
protocol are not compromised. We do assume that the enti-
ties know the (public) protocol parameters.
We adopt the following attacker model. We assume that
the attacker Mallory (M) controls the communication chan-
nel in a sense that he can eavesdrop messages and mod-
ify transmitted messages by adding his own messages to
the channel. We further assume that the attacker cannot
disable the communication channel (e.g., use a Faraday’s
cage to block the propagation of radio signals) between A
and B. The attacker can jam the transmission and in that
way prevent the transmission of the information contained
in the message. However, the receiver will still receive the
message from the sender, superimposed by the attacker’s
messages. Finally, we assume M to be computationally
bounded.
It is interesting to observe that the security of I-codes
themselves does not depend on the attacker being computa-
tionally bounded. However, authentication schemes derived
from I-codes presented in Section 5 do require the attacker
to be computationally bounded.
Our attacker model is similar to the the Dolev-Yao model
in that the attacker controls the communication channel, but
it differs in that we assume that the attacker cannot fully
schedule message transmission as it cannot disable the com-
munication channel. This means that the attacker cannot
trivially remove the energy of the signal from the channel
(we discuss this in more detail in Section 6).
Before introducing our solution to the above stated prob-
lem, we give some examples of attacks on message integrity
on the radio channel, which are relevant to our proposal.
Figure 1 shows two types of such attacks. The ﬁrst type
of attack is called bit ﬂipping, in which the attacker intro-
duces a signal on the channel that converts bit “0” into “1”
or vice-versa. This attack is shown in Figure 1(a) and Fig-
ure 1(b) for messages modulated using amplitude and fre-
quency modulation, respectively. Here, the bit is ﬂipped
such that the attacker adds to the channel the signal of the
opposite phase to the one representing the bit and the signal
representing the opposite bit. The second type of attack is
the signal overshadowing attack, shown in Figure 1(c). In
this attack, the attacker adds to the channel a signal repre-
senting a bit string different from the one sent by the honest
entity with a signiﬁcantly higher power than the one of the
original signal. In this way, the original signal, regardless of
its format or modulation, becomes entirely overshadowed
by the attacker’s signal, and is treated as noise by the re-
ceiver.

In the following sections, we show how these and simi-
lar attacks on message integrity can be detected through the
use of I-codes in conjunction with on-off keying and signal
anti-blocking components. Even though we make a clear
distinction between I-codes and on-off keying, that is, sig-
nal anti-blocking, we will often abuse the terminology and
call the triple (I-codes, on-off keying, signal anti-blocking)
an I-code.
3 Integrity (I)-codes
In a way similar to a message authentication code
(MAC), involving a shared secret key, and a signature
scheme, involving certiﬁed public keys, an integrity code
(I-code) provides a method of ensuring the integrity (and
a basis for authentication) of a message transmitted over a
public channel. The main difference is that an I-code re-
moves the assumption that the parties involved in the mes-
sage exchange share some prior secrets or/and certiﬁed pub-
lic keys.
3.1 Deﬁnition
I-codes allow a receiver B to verify the integrity of the
message received from the sender A, based solely on mes-
sage coding. We now give a more formal deﬁnition of in-
tegrity codes and the terminology we will use.
Deﬁnition 1 An integrity code is a triple (S,C, e), where
the following conditions are satisﬁed:
1. S is a ﬁnite set of possible source states (plaintext)
2. C is a ﬁnite set of binary codewords
3. e is a source encoding rule e : S → C, satisfying the
following:
• e is an injective function
• it is not possible to convert codeword c ∈ C to
(cid:2) (cid:4)= c, with-
another codeword c
out changing at least one bit “1” of c to bit “0”.
(cid:2) ∈ C, such that c
To make the above deﬁnition more concrete, we now
give two examples of I-codes.
Example 1 (Complementary encoding, Manchester code.)
The encoding rule (e) is the following:
1 −→ 10
0 −→ 01 .
Assume now that we want to encode messages from the
set S = {00, 01, 10, 11} using the above encoding rule.
Then, C = {0101, 0110, 1001, 1010}, i.e., e(00) = 0101,
e(01) = 0110, e(10) = 1001, and e(11) = 1010. This
encoding rule is clearly injective. Note further that each
codeword c ∈ C is characterized by the equal number of
“0”s and “1”s. Therefore, it is not possible to convert one
(cid:2) ∈ C, without ﬂip-
