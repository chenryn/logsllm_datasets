Abstract—We are at the dawn of a hyper connectivity age
otherwise known as the Internet of Things (IoT). It is widely
accepted that to be able to reap all beneﬁts from the IoT promise,
device security will be of paramount importance. A key require-
ment for most security solutions is the ability to provide secure
cryptographic key storage in a way that will easily scale in the IoT
age. In this paper, we focus on providing such a solution based on
Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). To this end, we focus on
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based gyroscopes and
show via wafer-level measurements and simulations, that it is
feasible to use the physical and electrical properties of these
sensors for cryptographic key generation. After identifying the
most promising features, we propose a novel quantization scheme
to extract bit strings from the MEMS analog measurements. We
provide upper and lower bounds for the minimum entropy of
the bit strings derived from the measurements and fully analyze
the intra- and inter-class distributions across the operation
range of the MEMS device. We complement these measurements
via Monte-Carlo simulations based on the distributions of the
parameters measured on actual devices. We also propose and
evaluate a key derivation procedure based on fuzzy extractors
for Hamming distance, using the min-entropy estimates obtained
to derive a full entropy 128-bit key, requiring 1219-bits of helper
data with an (authentication) failure probability of 4 · 10−7.
Thereby, we present a complete cryptographic key generation
chain. In addition, we propose a dedicated MEMS-PUF design,
which is superior to our measured sensor, in terms of chip area,
quality and quantity of key seed features.
I. INTRODUCTION
In 1991, Mark Weisser [1] set out the vision of ubiquitous
computation, which promised to make our interaction with
things to be seemless. Today, this vision has already started
to become reality through modern technologies that allow for
electronic systems to be embedded practically everywhere with
applications ranging from smart homes, to connected vehicles
and smart factories. More speciﬁcally, ubiquitous computation
has been made tangible in the concept of the Internet of Things
(IoT), which by some estimates is expected to surpass 50
billion devices by 2020 [2]. Regardless of the exact numbers,
it is widely acknowledged that to make the IoT a success the
security of this super large distributed systems will have to be
guaranteed and the privacy of the collected data protected.
The Internet of Things, made possible through the wide
deployment of embedded devices, differs signiﬁcantly from
”classical” systems, such as desktop (networked) PCs,
in
various aspects, which include: severe computational, memory,
and power constraints, lack of advanced user interfaces, an
increased vulnerability with respect to physical or network
attacks, and as mentioned previously, their tendency to collect
potentially highly privacy sensitive data. Until recently, there
has been an inclination to assume the inability to provide
strong hardware security guarantees. However, this is start-
ing to change with new device architectures such as those
presented in [3]–[5], which aim to provide more fundamen-
tal security properties for embedded devices. In this paper,
we continued this line of work and we focus our attention
on an even more constrained type of device, MEMS-based
sensor devices, which are widely deployed today in smart
phones, automotive applications (e.g., crash detection, airbag
deployment), environmental condition assessment, pressure
measurements, etc. and for which security solutions have been
until now overlooked.
As a starting point in the study security for MEMS-based
sensors, we look at how to provide secure cryptographic key
storage in such devices in a cheap and intrinsic manner, as
keeping cryptographic keys secure is the basis for many higher
level security mechanisms such as attestation, secure boot
as well as any other cryptographic operation which might
require a secret or private key (e.g., encryption, signatures,
message authentication generation, etc.). In particular, we look
at the feasibility of creating a Physical Unclonable Function
(PUF) based on the physical properties of MEMS devices
themselves. PUFs have received a lot of attention (see e.g.,
[6]–[10]) as a technology for secure key storage. One of
PUF’s main advantages is that the device does not need to
store secrets in non-volatile memory but rather it can generate
the cryptographic key whenever it needs to process secrets
and destroys it afterward, making the job of an attacker with
physical access to the device more difﬁcult1.
While the possibility of deriving a ﬁngerprint from MEMS-
based devices has been explored in previous work [14], the
feasibility of deriving a cryptographic key from MEMS char-

strated in [11]–[13].
acteristics is a more challenging undertaking and to the best
of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to propose such a design.
As with many PUFs, a MEMS-based PUF has the following
requirements:
the cryptographic key should be unique per
device (similar to a ﬁngerprint), (ii) the cryptographic key
should be reproducible across the whole range of environ-
mental conditions for which the device is designed, (iii) the
cryptographic key should be hard to replicate even for the
manufacturer of the device, (iv) the PUF properties should
be hard to model and therefore a mathematical model that
predicts the PUF responses should be infeasible to obtain,
and (v) it is desirable that the particular PUF has tamper
resistance or tamper evidence properties. In this paper, we
show that MEMS-based gyroscopes can be used to this
end and, moreover, we show via experimental evidence on
actual devices and simulations that requirements (i)-(iv) are
met by our design. Furthermore, we present and simulate a
fully functional MEMS device speciﬁcally designed for PUF
applications, which has smaller size than other gyroscopes and
has more variation (allowing for the derivation of more full
entropy bits). In short, our contributions are as follows:
• Physical Modelling: In contrast to previous work, which
use the response of MEMS accelerometers and derive
signal processing features suitable for identiﬁcation, we
identify suitable properties (mechanical and electrical) of
the MEMS gyroscopes and show that they can be used to
derive a robust bit string suitable for cryptographic key
generation,
• Key Derivation: We propose a quantization method
which allows us to derive binary keys from analog sensor
data inspired by a method described by Chang et al. [15].
Then, we analyze via multiple methods the amount of
entropy that such binary strings carry and based on a
conservative estimate we propose several helper data [16],
[17] parameters which would provide with robust keys
across a temperature range of 65 ◦C, with probabilities of
failure lower than 10−6. We also provide speciﬁc codes,
which can be used in combination with a fuzzy extractor
to create a uniformly distributed random 128-bit key.
• Uniqueness and Robustness: We analyze the intra- and
inter-class distributions induced by our key derivation
procedure from 70 different physical MEMS-devices and
verify the behavior of such distributions via Monte-
Carlo simulations of the MEMS behavior using variability
parameters measured on physical MEMS devices. This
analysis includes the variability due to repeated measure-
ments and environmental conditions, most prominantly,
temperature.
• MEMS Design Optimized for PUF Applications. We
present a completely new MEMS design, which has been
optimized to increase variability and thus, the ability to
create unique/robust keys
A. Organization of the Paper
We begin by providing basic background on MEMS tech-
nology, their potential for PUFs and cause of variations in
Section II. In Section III, we show how a MEMS-PUF should
be included in a package, to withstand probing attacks. We
then explain features of MEMS that fulﬁll our requirements
for robustness and uniqueness in Section IV, how we quantize
these features, how our measurements are set up and the
results for the most promising parameters. From the learned
insights, we then can simulate additional devices in Section
V. This allows us to verify that the simulations are consistent
with the measured data. In Section VI, we provide upper
and lower bounds for the min-entropy of the MEMS-PUF
responses for both measured and simulated data. In Section
VII, we describe the last step in the key generation process,
namely, information reconciliation via error correcting codes
and randomness extraction. It is worth observing that our
constructions tend to require less public helper data (measured
in bits) than recently published fuzzy extractor schemes, in
spite of our constructions are based on very conservative min-
entropy estimations2. We propose a dedicated MEMS-PUF
design in Section VIII. We conclude this article in Section
IX.
II. MEMS BACKGROUND
MEMS sensors are silicon based devices which combine
a microcontroller with a mechanical device used to measure
a variety of different physical quantities ranging from accel-
eration and yaw rate to magnetic ﬁelds, pressure, humidity,
etc. In this work, we focus on MEMS-based gyroscopes
which are devices for measuring the yaw rate. MEMS-based
gyroscopes are very complex entities with a large number
of mechanical as well as electrical properties. A MEMS
gyroscope typically consists of a combination of one or several
spring-mass systems which oscillate at resonant frequency.
In order to drive the system, an external source is needed
that applies the required voltage. To detect the yaw rate, the
Coriolis effect is used. This effect is based on the Coriolis
force, which acts on a moved mass in a rotating system.
The Coriolis force causes a deﬂection of an oscillating mass
which is proportional to the acting yaw rate. Therefore, the
yaw rate can be determined by measuring this deﬂection in
a capacitive way. The detecting axis depends on the moving
direction of an oscillating mass. For each detecting axis, at
least one oscillating spring-mass system is needed. This means
that
the number of different spring-mass systems depends
basically on the number of sensitive axis. In this work, a 3-
channel gyroscope was investigated. For further background
on gyroscopes we refer the reader to [18].
A. MEMS Parameters Suitable for Identiﬁcation
MEMS sensors offer many measurable mechanical as well
as electrical, parameters depending on the sensor type, which
can be used to derive a suitable unique identiﬁer and, after
2In the PUF literature, it is standard to use the Context Tree Weighing
(CTW) compression algorithm to estimate entropy of the PUF responses. We
use CTW as an upper bound on the entropy of the MEMS-PUF responses
but use the more conservative min-entropy estimations provided by the NIST
tests for our ﬁnal helper data sizes.
some processing, a secure cryptographic key. In the case of
MEMS-based gyroscopes, fundamental mechanical parameters
include the different frequency modes of the sensor. MEMS-
based gyroscopes have a complex mechanical structure which
consists of several spring-mass systems. Hence, a large num-
ber of frequency modes exist for MEMS-based gyroscopes.
Another interesting mechanical parameter is the quadrature
which is a measure for the asymmetry of a sensor. As the
manufacturing process is subjected to variations, the actual
physical structures, i.e., springs, masses and electrode gaps,
differ slightly from the ideal case by different
types of
asymmetries. This can result in a deﬂection of the moving
directions and produces an error signal called the quadrature
signal - which is detected by electrodes in a capacitive manner.
Additionally, there are a lot of electrical parameters. These
are the capacitances and resistances that are induced between
the different electrodes which are needed for driving and
measuring the sensor. Other properties are the ability for
frequency tuning, quality factors and decay times. However,
we do not describe them any further because they have not
proven to be suitable as PUF parameters in our evaluation.
B. Causes for Parameter Variability
Although, it is difﬁcult to determine all inﬂuencing factors
affecting the silicon manufacturing process, several of them
are well-known and understood. In what follows, we provide
an overview of the fundamental factors and their impact on
parameter variation. A main factor for the parameter variability
is the variation of the geometric dimensions (width and thick-
ness of the structures) that occurs always in the etching process
and it varies in a small range. This includes a variation of the
beam width of the springs and, hence, it changes the spring
rigidity, which leads to a shift of the resonant frequencies. In
addition, it affects the electrical parameters as well because it
changes the gaps between the electrodes and the effective area
of electrodes.
As mentioned previously, asymmetries cause slight vari-
ations of the behavior from the ideal case generating the
quadrature signal. These asymmetries have four sources:
1) A difference of the side wall inclinations, causing a
different deviation from the rectangular beam geometry
of side walls that results in an undesirable out-of-plane
force component.
2) A local variation of the structure width, affecting slightly
the spring rigidities.
3) An imbalance of the inertial masses.
4) The inﬂuence of mechanical stress caused by packaging,
temperature and bending of the Printed Circuit Board
(PCB) after soldering.
Note that actual MEMS sensors are designed with the
objective of minimal parameter variations. In principle, an
ampliﬁcation of the parameters’ variation is easy to achieve.
Notice that such an amplication is likely to result in an increase
in the number of bits extracted from a particular parameter.
This could be used for the creation of a dedicated MEMS

package (SIP).
structure to increase signiﬁcantly the number of bits that can
be derived.
III. MEMS-BASED PUF
MEMS sensors have an unique ﬁngerprint based on inherent
variability in silicon manufacturing processes. Since MEMS
sensors are present in numerous applications, adding secure
key storage capabilities would provide an additional value,
making them enhanced sensors. This means there would be no
need for additional devices solely for the purpose of key stor-
age. Furthermore, considering resilience to different kinds of
attacks, MEMS-PUFs offer several advantages. MEMS sensors
are very complex entities with many very different features and
the behavior is hard to model. Considering invasive attacks,
a read-out is expected to be difﬁcult, or in some cases even
infeasible. The reason for this is that tampering with a MEMS
or even with the mold package changes the properties of the
MEMS and thus the key, e.g., by changing the stress conditions
inserted by the packaging process or by changing the internal
pressure. Hence, MEMS could provide a tamper-proof PUF
without any overhead which was identiﬁed as a major future
research topic in [19].
Fig. 1 shows schematically an usual example for a system
in package (SIP) with a MEMS sensor and an ASIC that are
encased by a mold package. MEMS and ASIC are placed on
the same level, connected by wire bonds and placed on a PCB
substrate with a Ball Grid Array for the electrical contacts
to the environment. Alternatively, MEMS and ASIC could
also be stacked vertically and connected by through-silicon
vias. For high security applications, it is recommendable to
carry out all security relevant operations for authentication or
encryption on the ASIC. In this case, the secret key would
never leave the package in order to make it infeasible for
an attacker to get access to security-critical information. For
this, a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) would be
needed within the system additionally to the cryptographic
key derived from the MEMS. One approach to derive truly
random numbers could be to exploit the thermal noise as a
source of entropy which is present in the measurements of the
electrical capacitances between the electrodes, for example.
The use of thermal noise for the generation of random numbers
has already been described in previous work as in [20], [21].
On the basis of the above-mentioned assumptions, such a
system would possess similar security properties as a hardware
security module (HSM) [22] or a trusted platform module
MEMSASICMoldPackage(TPM) [23]. This could also be further enhanced by the
development, e.g., of speciﬁc package concepts, increasing
systems security. Moreover, new MEMS concepts could be
exclusively designed for the use as PUFs only (dedicated
MEMS-PUFs).
IV. IDENTIFICATION OF SUITABLE FEATURES
In order to identify suitable features for the use as a PUF,
we have to point out initially the requirements that a feature
has to fulﬁll. These can be derived in principle from the PUF
deﬁnition.
1) Uniqueness. Based on the used parameters,
it must
be possible to identify the device absolutely uniquely.
Measurable variability of the used parameters has to
be inherent in the system. This variability should not
be controllable even for the manufacturer in order for
copying attacks to become infeasible.
2) Robustness. The parameters should be stable even when
affected by different environmental conditions, i.e., tem-
perature, humidity, aging.
3) High Bit Entropy. In case of using several parameters to
derive the ﬁnal response, low correlation among them
should preferably exist. This is important because, the
stronger the parameters correlate, the less entropy do
they offer for the extracted cryptographic key.
A. Quantization Scheme
The generation of a binary key from the measured values
requires a quantization procedure beforehand. The general
problem of converting such analog measured values into binary
strings is also known in the ﬁeld of biometrics. Thus, a
procedure is developed that is inspired by a method described
by Chang et al. [15]. There, the authors proposed a procedure
for cryptographic key generation from biometric features and
veriﬁed it, as it applies to human face recognition. The
