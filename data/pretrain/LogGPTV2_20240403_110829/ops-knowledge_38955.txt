User: I need to create an executable for windows 8.1 and lower, so I tried Py2Exe (no success) and then PyInstaller, and damn it, it worked.
Now I need to run it as admin (everytime since that uses admin tasks).
My actual compiling script looks like this : 
python pyinstaller.py --onefile --noconsole --icon=C:\Python27\my_distrib\ico_name --name=app_name C:\Python27\my_distrib\script.py
Is there an option to use UAC or things like this ? (its mess to me)
Also, everytime I start it on my laptop windows 8.1 (my desktop computer is windows 7) it says that is dangerous... Anything to make it a "trust" exe?
Thanks in advance
Assistant: PyInstaller 3.0 includes the --uac-admin option!
