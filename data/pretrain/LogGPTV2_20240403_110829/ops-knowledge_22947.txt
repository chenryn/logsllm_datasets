User: The celery docs suggest that Rabbit-MQ must act like a middleman, where it is used as a messaging platform. 
In my infrastructure, Rabbit-MQ is the primary server that serves me with some data every second. Now, whenever the data is served, I want Celery to do certain tasks. 
Now, this throws out the whole publisher-worker model, as we're not using Celery where the messages are being produced. 
So, how do I go about this?
Assistant: Celery can use several back-ends. If you are already using RabbitMQ, it makes that option attractive. 
These are however different concerns. Use a generic RabbitMQ client library such as pika to implement a consumer for your messages, then, if needed, use Celery to schedule tasks.
