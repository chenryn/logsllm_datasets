The `peek` function is very useful and an efficient alternative to marking and
resetting a stream when all you need to do is get a single character. The
current `peek` returns a byte, however, which leads to errors when people
assume that they can compare that byte to a character and check for a
character (only works for UTF-8 streams and ASCII characters). This was a
significant annoyance in implementing #16024. This is technically not breaking
since `Base.peek` isn't exported. Most code that uses it will actually
continue to work.
