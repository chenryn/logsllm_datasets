It quickly dies the the following error message:
npm ERR! code EEXIST  
npm ERR! syscall mkdir  
npm ERR! path G:\My Drive\Git\vscode-extension-samples\vscode-extension-
samples\lsp-sample\node_modules.staging  
npm ERR! errno -4075  
npm ERR! EEXIST: file already exists, mkdir 'G:\My Drive\Git\vscode-extension-

# What's weird
is that it complains that the .staging directory already exists, when it is
the install process itself that created the folder (when I start, there is no
preexisting node_modules folder).
Any idea what the problem might be ? I've tried reinstalling npm, deleting the
node_modules folder and starting over, deleting the intermediate .staging
folder, using the --force option, to no avail...
