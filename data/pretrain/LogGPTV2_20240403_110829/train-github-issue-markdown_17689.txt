I am currently working on a Go client to interact with the Kubernetes (k8s) API. However, I encountered multiple errors when attempting to import the `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/api` package using `go get`. Here are the specific error messages:

```plaintext
$ go get k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/api

../../../k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/api/types.generated.go:682: too many errors
```

These errors indicate that the `codec.encDriver` and `codec.decDriver` types do not have the required methods (`EncodeEnd`, `IsContainerType`, and `ReadEnd`). This suggests that there might be an incompatibility issue with the version of the dependencies being used.

To resolve this, you may want to ensure that you are using compatible versions of the Kubernetes and related packages. You can also try updating your Go environment and dependencies to the latest versions. Additionally, consider using the official Kubernetes client-go library, which is designed for interacting with the Kubernetes API and is more likely to be up-to-date and compatible with the current Kubernetes versions.

Here is an example of how to use `client-go`:

1. Install the `client-go` library:
   ```sh
   go get k8s.io/client-go@latest
   ```

2. Use the `client-go` library in your code to interact with the Kubernetes API.

This should help you avoid the issues you are encountering and provide a more stable and supported way to work with the Kubernetes API.
