User: I have .so files that work well on my Ubuntu 32bit, would I need different version of them to work on my Raspberry Pi? I am loading them using python. If it wont work, What should I go through?
Assistant: You'll need to recompile them from source. x86 and ARM are completely different microprocessor architectures, and programs/libraries compiled for one will not work on the other.
