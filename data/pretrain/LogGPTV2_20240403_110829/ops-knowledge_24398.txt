Question: A Windows Server system has just restarted after a CrashOnAuditFail event where CrashOnAuditFail was set to 2. As an administrator, you are assessing the situation. Which of the following actions should you take? (Select two)
"A": "Trigger an alert for the occurrence of the event, as it indicates the system halted due to inability to record an auditable event.",
"B": "Ignore the event if repeated frequently, as it is common for systems to reboot without recording all auditable activities.",
"C": "Verify if the CrashOnAuditFail flag is enabled, as its occurrence without the flag suggests deviation from baseline settings.",
"D": "Lower the CrashOnAuditFail setting to 1 to prevent future system halts, as frequent reboots can be disruptive."
Answer: AC
