## Abstract
Studying the evolution of network configuration can enhance our understanding of the increasing complexity of networks and help in reducing configuration errors. However, the nature of changes made by operators to network configurations is not well understood. To improve this understanding, we analyze five years of router, switch, and firewall configurations from two large campus networks, using logs from version control systems. We examine how configuration tasks are distributed and how they evolve over time for different types of devices and locations. We also investigate the frequency and timing of configuration changes, and whether certain devices or tasks experience more changes than others. Our findings can help designers of configuration languages and management systems to automate and rigorously test specific aspects of configuration.

## 1. Introduction
The behavior of a communication network is largely determined by the configuration of its constituent devices, each configured independently. Despite its importance, little is known about the nature of these configurations. Network operators use low-level commands to implement high-level tasks, often leading to mistakes. While some studies have examined static snapshots of configurations, there is limited understanding of how configurations evolve over time.

Studying the evolution of network configurations over time can provide unique insights:
1. **Understanding Network Function Evolution:** We can learn how network functions change and which tasks contribute to increased complexity.
2. **Improving Configuration Testing:** Knowledge of how configurations change can inform targeted test cases, reducing errors.
3. **Enhancing Configuration Management:** Understanding where operators spend their time can help in designing better configuration environments.

This paper presents a longitudinal study of the evolution of network configurations in two large campus networks: Georgia Tech and the University of Wisconsin. By comparing these networks, we identify common trends and specific practices. We analyze changes made to routers, switches, and firewalls over a five-year period, addressing the following questions:
- How does the size of network configurations evolve over time?
- What types of changes (additions, modifications, deletions) are most common?
- Do changes occur at specific times?
- Which factors contribute most to configuration evolution?
- What parts of the configuration change most frequently, and why?
- Are there dependencies and correlations in configuration changes?

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 Configuration Management
Both campus networks use RANCID, a configuration management tool that tracks and monitors device configurations. RANCID pulls current configurations, stores them in a version control system, and allows operators to track changes. The version control system (CVS) tracks changes by assigning unique revision numbers and storing metadata such as the time of change, comments, and author.

### 2.2 Related Work
Previous work has focused on static analysis of network configurations to understand properties and diagnose misconfigurations. Some tools perform network-wide static analysis to detect errors and identify sources of complexity. Other projects have explored dynamic changes in configurations, but typically over shorter periods and smaller datasets. The field of software repository mining, which examines the evolution of software, provides a similar approach to analyzing configuration changes.

## 3. Data and Analysis
### 3.1 Data
We collected five years of archived configuration files from all network devices (routers, firewalls, and switches) in both networks. Table 1 shows the number of devices in each network.

| Device Type | Georgia Tech | University of Wisconsin |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Routers     | 16           | 53                      |
| Firewalls   | 365          | 325                     |
| Switches    | 716          | 1246                    |
| Total       | 1097         | 1624                    |

### 3.2 Analysis
#### 3.2.1 Developing Abstractions for Functionality
To analyze the configurations, we map low-level commands to high-level functionalities. This helps in identifying the types of tasks operators perform and the amount of time spent on each task. Table 2 shows the functionality map.

| Meaning            | Examples                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Device Management  | Username, password, logging, AAA         |
| Interface Settings | Interface definition, switchport, duplex  |
| Layer 2 Settings   | ARP, MAC address, spanning-tree           |
| VLAN Settings      | VLAN definition, trunk mode, access mode  |
| Layer 3 Settings   | IP address, gateway, routing protocols    |
| Access Control     | Access-list, permit, deny                 |
| Security           | VPN, IPsec, crypto, webvpn                |
| Control Filtering  | Prefix-list, policy-map, service-policy   |
| QoS                | Class-map, port-channel load-balance      |

#### 3.2.2 Change Analysis
We perform three types of analysis on the configuration changes:
- **Snapshot and Change Analysis:** We analyze a snapshot of the network configuration to understand the composition and the extent of changes associated with different functions.
- **Change Types:** We use difflib to infer additions, deletions, and modifications by comparing consecutive revisions.
- **Correlation Analysis:** We explore dependencies and correlations in configuration changes.

## 4. Results
Our findings show that configurations continue to grow over time, influenced by various factors such as infrastructure expansion and policy changes. Routers experience more frequent changes, and these changes involve a broader range of tasks compared to switches and firewalls. There are similarities in the configurations between the two campuses, but distinct practices, such as the use of static ARP entries, appear on general-purpose devices like core routers. Correlated changes in switch and router configurations suggest the potential for better configuration tools.

## 5. Discussion and Future Work
Our findings suggest areas for improvement in configuration management and testing. For example, correlated changes can be used to suggest automated configuration changes, and the high frequency of router configuration updates suggests the need for automated network-wide configuration management systems.

## 6. Conclusion
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of network configurations in two large campus networks. Our findings highlight the need for better configuration management and testing tools, and offer insights into the nature of configuration changes over time.
