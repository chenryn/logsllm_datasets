### 5. Incremental Benefit Analysis

Figure 8(b) presents the same data as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the incremental net advertising benefit (INAB) of advertising versus not advertising on these queries. The scatter plot in Figure 8(a) shows that most advertisers (61%) receive very little incremental benefit (less than 10%) from advertising on navigational queries where they are already the top organic result. This is evident from the points clustering along the diagonal.

For 32% of advertisers, the incremental benefit is even lower, indicating that the cost of advertising on such queries may outweigh the benefits. The CDF in Figure 8(b) further illustrates this, showing that the majority of advertisers do not see significant gains from advertising on navigational queries where they already have a strong organic presence.

### 6. Poaching Competitor Traffic

**Poaching** refers to advertising strategies that involve bidding on navigational queries specifically seeking a competitor’s website (e.g., queries with competitor’s trademarked terms or brand names). Initially, Google's trademark usage policy prevented advertisers from bidding on trademarked keywords they did not own or using them in their ad content. However, the restriction on bidding on competitors’ trademarked keywords was relaxed in 2004, and restrictions on using them in ad content were relaxed in 2009 [1, 2]. This relaxation increased the cost per click of trademarked keywords by allowing competition from third parties, thereby increasing trademark owners' costs as they had to bid defensively to protect their trademarks.

#### 6.1 Offense

We analyzed the benefit of trying to poach users seeking to navigate to a competitor. Figure 10(a) compares the net advertising benefit (NAB) for poaching ads (poach-ad) against the NAB of not advertising on the same queries (poach-noad). Each data point represents an advertiser with sufficient conversion data. About half of the advertisers fall below the diagonal, indicating that poaching is detrimental. For the other half, the absolute benefits are negligible, with the NAB generally below 0.01.

Figure 11 plots the CDF of the INAB for these advertisers. For 50% of advertisers, poaching has negative value, likely due to few conversions and high costs associated with such ads. A minority of advertisers, however, see significant relative gains, but in absolute terms, the number of conversions remains low.

#### 6.2 Defense

Regardless of the effectiveness of poaching for the advertiser, competitors may still be harmed because they value lost conversions more dearly. We consider whether it is useful for an advertiser to defend against potential poaching by outbidding competitors for ad space despite being the top organic result for a navigational query.

Figure 10(b) compares the NAB of defensive ads (nav-comp-ad) against the NAB of not advertising on the same queries (nav-comp-noad). Figure 12 plots the CDF of the INAB for these advertisers. The results are mixed: 20% of advertisers realize significant (INAB > 25%) benefits, while 32% are negatively impacted by attempting to defend these queries.

#### 6.3 Spending Smarter

As an alternative to poaching a competitor’s customers, an advertiser might try to recruit customers who are likely to convert somewhere but have not yet decided on a particular vendor. Figure 10(c) plots the additional benefit of advertising on commercial queries where the advertiser does not have an organic presence (NAB(noorg-ad)) versus the benefit of poaching ads over not poaching (NAB(poach-ad) - NAB(poach-noad)). For 78% of the advertisers, advertising on commercial queries where they have no organic presence is significantly more beneficial than poaching.

### 7. Displaying Ad Extensions

**Call extensions** allow advertisers to add a call button to their ads when rendered on mobile phones. Call buttons are also shown for business listings in organic search results. These features are provided by our partner ad network at no additional cost to the advertisers. Our preliminary results show that creating a business listing, which allows the ad network to show a call button in organic results, is beneficial to advertisers.

#### 7.1 Organic Business Listings

Businesses can create a free listing that includes their location, phone number, store hours, parking information, and payment methods accepted through the network’s “Places for Business” portal or third-parties like Yelp. The ad network uses this structured information to enhance the presentation of organic results, including showing the call button and map directions.

Figure 13(a) plots the NAB of having an organic call button (phone-orgcall) versus the NAB of plain search results (phone-org) for searches performed on mobile phones. Since both NABs are for organic results, the cost term in the NAB computation is zero, and NAB reduces to conversions per impression. Figure 14 plots the CDF of the INAB of call button over plain results, showing that the median conversions per impression increase by a factor of 10 when an organic call result is present.

#### 7.2 Ads with Call Extensions

When an advertiser places a call button in an ad, it is possible that the ad results in an offline conversion; i.e., the user calls the advertiser and converts without further web interaction. Therefore, we define a conversion event for ads with call extensions as either a call or an advertiser-reported conversion.

Figure 13(b) compares the NAB of mobile search ads with call extensions (phone-orgcall-adcall) versus the NAB of organic business listings with call buttons (phone-orgcall) for businesses that both advertise call extensions and have created an organic listing. Figure 15 plots the CDF of the corresponding INAB. We find that even if organic search results contain a call button extension, ads employing the same are effective for 74% of advertisers but ineffective for the remaining 26%.

For businesses that do not have a high-enough organic rank, Figure 13(c) compares the NAB of mobile search ads with call extensions (phone-noorg-adcall) versus the NAB of ads without the call extension (phone-noorg-ad). Figure 16 plots the CDF of the corresponding INAB, showing that ads with a call extension are universally more effective.

Preliminary data suggests that there are mixed benefits to using call extensions for businesses where organic listings include a call button. For businesses that do not have a high-enough organic rank, there is a consistent boost from call extensions in search ads. However, since call extensions and business listings are recent features, our results are preliminary, and we encourage advertisers to conduct their own experiments to assess the effectiveness of call extensions in their specific case.

#### 7.3 Spending Smarter

Finally, we compare the marginal benefit of call extensions in mobile ads to the benefit of traditional advertising on computers. Figure 17 plots the marginal benefit of running mobile ads with call extensions over organic business listings with call buttons (phone-noorg-adcall) versus advertising on desktops and laptops. For 75% of the advertisers in our dataset, it is more beneficial to focus on mobile call ads versus desktop ads.

While our dataset is limited, our initial assessment indicates greater benefits from adding call buttons to ads on mobile compared to traditional advertising on desktop when organic presence is poor.

### 8. Discussion

#### 8.1 Choosing Traffic Slices

The techniques used in this paper can estimate the profitability achieved by an advertiser over an arbitrary slice of traffic representative of a particular advertising strategy. To measure the effectiveness of advertising, we identify similar search impressions with and without ads. An ideal comparison would require impressions where the presence of an ad is the only distinguishing attribute. However, even the largest search engines have sparse data when aggregated at the query level [24].

To have reasonable samples of impressions, we aggregate impressions by the category of user query. The techniques discussed can also be applied to traffic slices aggregated on other attributes like geography or user characteristics.

#### 8.2 Systemic Biases

A source of bias in our analyses is that queries for which ads are shown are often more representative of the advertiser than queries where ads are not shown for comparable traffic slices. This is because whenever ads are shown, both the ad network and advertiser find the query relevant. When ads are not shown, the ad network finds the query relevant to the advertiser, but the advertiser does not. Thus, whenever results returned by the ad network are poor, users are less likely to choose the advertiser from organic results, lowering the NAB for the traffic slice without ads.

An exception is when the advertiser tries to poach users looking for a competitor (Section 6.1). In this case, while the impressions with the advertiser's ad are likely to be more attractive, they also cost more.

Finally, in Section 7, queries for which the ad network presents a result with a call button are often more relevant to a mobile user than queries where a web result is delivered, potentially overstating the NAB for organic search results with call buttons.

### 9. Related Work

**Measuring Ad Effectiveness:** Several studies have measured the effectiveness of display advertising campaigns [27, 29]. These studies measure the incremental impact of advertising by creating treatment and control groups. We take a similar approach by identifying comparable traffic slices and measuring the incremental impact of advertising.

Reiley, Lewis, and Rao have highlighted the challenges in conducting such studies [30, 31] and how the benefits of advertising can be difficult to quantify accurately.
