INAB of advertising over not advertising on these queries. As
is evident from points clustering along the diagonal in the scatter

tal beneﬁt (less than 10%) from advertising on navigational queries
where they are the top organic result. Moreover, for 32% of ad-

carefully calibrated A/B tests to determine the incremental bene-
ﬁt of advertising for queries where the user is already looking to
navigate to the advertiser.
6. POACHING COMPETITOR TRAFFIC
Poaching refers to advertising strategies that involve bidding
on navigational queries speciﬁcally seeking a competitor’s web-
site (e.g., queries with competitor’s trademarked terms or brand
names). Initially, Google’s trademark usage policy prevented ad-
vertisers from bidding on trademarked keywords they did not own
or from using them in their ad content; the restriction of bidding
on competitors’ trademarked keywords was relaxed in 2004—even
if the trademark owner explicitly objected—and restrictions on us-
ing them in ad content were relaxed in 2009 [1, 2]. The relaxed
policy effectively increased the cost per click of trademarked key-
words by allowing competition from third parties, thereby increas-
ing trademark owners’ costs by compelling them to bid defensively
to protect their trademark.
We ﬁnd that poaching may help smaller advertisers get users who
would not navigate to the advertiser in the absence of ads. But, the
costs of attempting to gain such users may be too high for some
advertisers when compared to the cost they pay for an average con-
version. Moreover, given the varied effectiveness of poaching, de-
fending against poaching has uneven results and can, in fact, occa-
sionally lead to negative results due to the high cost of defense.
6.1 Offense
Here, we analyze the beneﬁt of trying to poach users seeking
to navigate to a competitor. Figure 10(a) compares the NAB for
poaching ads (poach-ad, i.e., ads on navigational queries where
the advertiser is not the top-most organic search result) against the
NAB of not advertising on the same queries (poach-noad, i.e., navi-
gational queries where the advertiser has an organic presence but is
not the top-most organic result, and does not display an ad). Each
data point represents an advertiser where we have sufﬁcient conver-
sion data. About half the advertisers fall below the diagonal show-
ing that poaching is actually detrimental. For the half that do see
relative gains over not advertising, the absolute beneﬁts are negli-
gible (note the absolute value of NAB is generally below 0.01).
Figure 11 plots the CDF of the INAB for these advertisers. For
50% of advertisers, poaching is of negative value—likely due to
few conversions and high costs associated with such ads. There
Figure 11: For most advertisers, poaching competitor’s naviga-
tional queries yields little beneﬁt, while some see extreme gains.
are however, a minority that see signiﬁcant gains relative to their
performance when ads are not shown. This is due to the very poor
rate at which they obtain trafﬁc when they do not show ads; said
another way, while the relative gains are substantial, in absolute
terms they still do not receive many conversions.
6.2 Defense
Regardless of how effective poaching is for the advertiser, com-
petitors may still be harmed because they value lost conversions
more dearly. Here, we consider whether it is useful for an adver-
tiser to defend against potential poaching by out-bidding competi-
tors for ad space despite being the top organic result for a naviga-
tional query. This data represents a speciﬁc scenario of advertising
for navigational queries (discussed in Section 5.2) where a competi-
tor ad is also present. We consider an advertiser a potential victim
of poaching for a given query if: i) the search query is classiﬁed
as navigational, i.e., the user query includes branded terms (e.g.,
Amazon or Macys) that suggests the user is seeking a speciﬁc web-
site, ii) the advertiser is the top-most organic result for that query,
and iii) another advertiser advertises on the query.
Figure 10(b) compares the NAB of defensive ads (nav-comp-ad,
i.e., ads on navigational queries where the advertiser is the top-
most organic search result) against the NAB of not advertising on
the same queries (nav-comp-noad). Figure 12 plots the CDF of
the INAB for these advertisers. The results are mixed: 20% of
advertisers realize signiﬁcant (INAB > 25%) beneﬁts, while a 32%
are negatively impacted by attempting to defend these queries.

6.3 Spending smarter
As an alternative to poaching a competitor’s customers (i.e.,
users who have issued a navigational search query for a compet-
ing website), an advertiser might try instead to recruit customers
who are likely to convert somewhere, but have not yet decided on
a particular vendor. Here we consider an advertiser deciding be-
tween spending money on poaching ads vs. spending that money
to compete on commercial queries (i.e., those that are likely to lead
to conversions) where they may not be prominently ranked in the
organic results, Figure 10(c) plots the additional beneﬁt of adver-
tising on commercial queries where the advertiser does not have an
organic presence i.e. NAB(noorg-ad) vs. the beneﬁt of poaching
ads over not poaching (NAB(poach-ad) - NAB(poach-noad)). For
78% of the advertisers, advertising on commercial queries where
the advertiser has no organic presence dominates poaching by a
wide margin (i.e., the are signiﬁcantly above the diagonal).
7. DISPLAYING AD EXTENSIONS
Call extensions allow advertisers to explicitly add a call button
to their ads when rendered on mobile phones. Call buttons are also
shown for business listings in the organic search results. These
features are provided by our partner ad network for no additional
cost to the advertisers. We have limited data for different advertis-
ing strategies on mobile devices. However, our preliminary results
show that creating a business listing, which would allow the ad net-
work to show a call button in organic results, is beneﬁcial to the
advertisers. The effect of adding a call button to an ad when an
organic result with call button is already present is mixed.
7.1 Organic business listings
Businesses can create a (free) listing that includes their loca-
tion, phone number, store hours, parking information, and payment
methods accepted through the network’s “Places for Business” por-
tal or third-parties like Yelp. The ad network uses this structured
information to enhance the presentation of organic results including
showing the call button, map directions, and so on.
We ﬁrst look at the effectiveness of the call button for organic
business listings vs. plain search results. It is challenging, how-
ever, to deﬁne conversion rates in these scenarios. We obviously
have no way of knowing from the search logs how many users that
call the business end up converting in a way that is equivalent to
the conversions in previous sections; here, we consider the simple
act of a user contacting the business by clicking the call button as
a conversion event for the purposes of computing the NAB. For
organic listings without call buttons, however, no similar data is
available. Instead, we substitute the conversion rate the advertisers
obtain when they advertise on local queries. While conversions are
potentially an undercount when compared to calls, we hope that
using the conversion rate for ads as opposed to organic clicks re-
stores some of the balance, offering a reasonable baseline of user
engagement.
Figure 13(a) plots the NAB of having an organic call button
(phone-orgcall) vs NAB of plain search results (phone-org) for
searches performed on mobile phones. Note that since both NABs

are for organic results—for which businesses do not pay—the cost
term in the NAB computation is zero, and NAB reduces to conver-
sions per impression. Figure 14 plots the CDF of the INAB of call
button over plain results. As evident from the ﬁgures, median con-
versions per impression increases by a factor of 10 when a organic
call result is present.
7.2 Ads with call extensions
When an advertiser chooses to place a call button in an ad, it is
possible the ad results in a conversion off-line; i.e., rather than nav-
igating to the website and converting, the user may instead call the
advertiser and “convert” by making a purchase or similar analogous
activity without further web interaction. Hence, when considering
conversions for ads with call extensions, we deﬁne a conversion
event to be either a call or an advertiser-reported conversion. For
the very few impressions that result in both, we report only one
conversion.
Figure 13(b) compares the NAB of mobile search ads with call
extensions (phone-orgcall-adcall) vs. the NAB of organic business
listings with call buttons (phone-orgcall) for the very few busi-
nesses in our dataset that both advertise call extensions as well as
created an organic listing, as well as reported a sufﬁcient number
of conversion events. Figure 15 plots the CDF of the correspond-
ing INAB. We ﬁnd that even if organic search results contain a call
button extension, ads employing the same are effective for 74% of
advertisers, but ineffective for the remaining 26%. The orders-of-
magnitude larger NAB (and INAB) values in this section can be
attributed to the relative paucity of data for results using the call
extension.
For businesses that do not have a rank high enough to be listed
in the organic results, Figure 13(c) compares the NAB of mobile
search ads with call extensions (phone-noorg-adcall) vs. the NAB
Figure 17: Call ads on mobile are better than regular desktop ads
in the absence of organic presence.
of ads without the call extension (phone-noorg-ad). Figure 16 plots
the CDF of the corresponding INAB. We ﬁnd that ads with a call
extension are universally more effective.
Preliminary data suggests that there are mixed beneﬁts to using
call extensions for businesses where organic listings include call
button. For businesses that do not have a high-enough organic rank
for their listing to appear in the ﬁrst page of ads, however, there
is a consistent boost from call extensions in search ads. That be-
ing said, since call extensions and business listings are both recent
features and very few advertisers have opted-in to both, our results
are preliminary and we encourage advertisers to conduct their own
experiments and compute their respective INABs to assess the ef-
fectiveness of the call extension in their speciﬁc case.
7.3 Spending smarter
In closing, we compare the marginal beneﬁt of call extensions
in mobile ads to the beneﬁt of traditional advertising on comput-
ers. As we discussed previously, the beneﬁt of the latter depends
tremendously on the position of the advertiser in the organic search
results. As an optimistic estimate, we focus on an advertiser who
appears sixth in the organic search results. Speciﬁcally, Figure 17
plots the marginal beneﬁt of running mobile ads with call extension
over organic business listings with call button (phone-noorg-adcall)
vs. advertising on desktops and laptops. For 75% of the advertisers
in our dataset, it is (modestly) more beneﬁcial to focus on mobile
call ads vs. desktop ads.
While we have limited data in our dataset, our initial assessment
indicates greater beneﬁts can be obtained by adding call buttons to
ads on mobile compared to traditional advertising on desktop when
organic presence is poor.
8. DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss our choice of using aggregated trafﬁc
slices and the underlying systemic bias that exists in the way the
trafﬁc slices are chosen for comparison.

The techniques that we use in this paper can be applied to es-
timate the proﬁtability achieved by an advertiser over an arbitrary
slice of trafﬁc that is representative of a particular advertising strat-
egy. To measure the effectiveness of advertising, we identify sim-
ilar search impressions with and without ads. For this, an ideal
comparison would require impressions where the presence of an
ad is the only distinguishing attribute. However, even the largest
search engines have only sparse data when aggregated at the query
level [24].
In order to have reasonable samples of impressions,
we aggregate impressions by the category of user query. Note that
the techniques we discuss in this paper can however be applied to
trafﬁc slices aggregated on other attributes like geography or user
characteristics.
8.2 Systemic biases
A source of bias in our analyses is that queries for which ads are
shown are often more representative of the advertiser than queries
where ads are not shown for comparable trafﬁc slices. This is be-
cause whenever ads are shown, both the ad network and advertiser
ﬁnd the query relevant. But, when ads are not shown, the ad net-
work ﬁnds query relevant to advertiser but advertiser does not. So,
whenever results returned by the ad network are poor, users are less
likely to choose the advertiser from organic results hence lowering
NAB for the trafﬁc slice without ads.
An exception to this rule is when the advertiser tries to poach
users looking for a competitor (Section 6.1). This is because in case
of poaching, while the impressions with advertiser ad are likely to
be more attractive to the advertiser, they also cost more.
Finally, in Section 7 queries for which the ad network presents
a result with a call button are often more relevant to a mobile user
than queries where a web result is delivered; hence, the NAB for
organic search results with call buttons may be overstated.
9. RELATED WORK
Measuring ad effectiveness. There have been a number of
studies measuring the effectiveness of display advertising ad cam-
paigns [27, 29]. These studies measure the incremental impact of
advertising by creating a treatment and a control group. We take a
similar approach by identifying comparable trafﬁc slices and then
measuring the incremental impact of advertising.
Reiley, Lewis and Rao have also highlighted the challenges in
conducting such studies [30, 31] and how the beneﬁts of advertising
