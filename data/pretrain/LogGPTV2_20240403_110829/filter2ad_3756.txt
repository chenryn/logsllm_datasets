ABSTRACT
Flexible display devices allow users to interact with the de-
vice by deforming the surface of the display to trigger a com-
mand. When these devices become mainstream, for exam-
ple as smart phones, e-readers, or tablets, they will require
a means of authenticating legitimate users. In this poster,
we present an authentication scheme for ﬂexible display de-
vices, its implementation on a ﬂexible display prototype and
an ongoing user study evaluating the usability and security
of our system.

INTRODUCTION
Flexible display devices allow users to interact with the
device by deforming the surface of the display to trigger a
command. Application areas for ﬂexible display devices in-
clude gaming, control of media and home appliances, and
smart phones [4]. While these devices are currently not
available to consumers, several prototypes have been devel-
oped to explore their interaction modalities. Lahey et al.
created PaperPhone, a ﬂexible display smart phone [5]. In
their user studies, participants deﬁned bend gestures and
associated them with functionalities. Based on the results
from their user studies, Lahey et al. proposed a classiﬁcation
scheme that categorized bend gestures by location (top cor-
ner, side, or bottom corner) and their polarity (up or down).
Kildal et al. developed the Kinetic device, a deformable mo-
bile phone [4]. They used this device to explore bending
and twisting, and proposed a set of design guidelines for de-
formable devices [4]. When ﬂexible display devices become
mainstream, for example as smart phones, as e-readers, or

tablets, they will require a means of authenticating legit-
imate users.
In this poster, we present an authentication
scheme for ﬂexible display devices that takes advantage of
users’ motor learning capabilities. We also show the imple-
mentation of our authentication scheme on a ﬂexible display
prototype. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been
any work investigating authentication schemes on ﬂexible
display devices. Our main contributions are as follows:
• We designed and implemented an authentication scheme
on a ﬂexible display prototype.
• We are conducting a user study to evaluate the us-
ability and security of our authentication scheme and
ﬂexible display prototype. We are also comparing the
usability and security of our system with a PIN based
password system.
2. RELATED WORK
While no work has looked at authentication mechanisms
on ﬂexible display devices, some work explores the creation
of passwords utilizing the motor learning capabilities of users.
Bianchi et al. developed the Haptic Wheel [2] and the Se-
cure Haptic Keypad [1]. Passwords in these systems use a
series of vibrotactile cues called tactons. Users authenticate
on these systems by placing their ﬁnger on one of three keys
(Haptic Keypad) or their hand around a rotary dial (Haptic
Wheel). After each input, the system randomizes the vibra-
tions it emits to protect the system from shoulder surﬁng.
Chong et al. [3] developed GesturePIN, a mobile authentica-
tion system that allows users to create a PIN by performing
a series of gestures on their mobile device. Gestures are
performed by moving the mobile device in 3D (three dimen-
sional) space, and users can perform a total of 10 gestures.
Mott et al. [6] developed TangibleRubik, an authentication
mechanism that requires users to physically manipulate a
Rubik’s Cube to authenticate a system. The various combi-
nations of moves act as the users’ password. By having users
physically manipulate the cube, the system takes advantage
of humans’ innate ability to recall motor actions through
repetition. Mott et al. conducted a user study to evalu-
ate the usability and security of their system. Participants
completed a training session requiring them to successfully
enter their password three times before moving on to the ex-
perimental trials. Textual representations of the passwords
were visible to the user at all times during the training tri-
als. This was done to aid in the learning of the password.
In the experimental trials, which directly followed training,
participants had to correctly enter their password ﬁve times.

ible display.
After the experimental trials, participants were given a dis-
tractor task for a duration of 10 minutes, which consisted of
a word search. After the distractor task, participants were
asked to enter their password a ﬁnal time as a test of pass-
word mastery. Mott et al. found that participants were able
to eﬀectively recall 7 and 10 gesture passwords after being
removed from the system for a short time.
3. PROTOTYPES
We developed two prototypes, a ﬂexible display prototype
for creating gesture-based passwords and a mobile phone
prototype for creating PINs.
3.1 Flexible Display
Our ﬂexible display prototype is composed of four main
components: ﬂexible display, pico projector, Arduino Uno
Microcontroller and a control panel. Three of these compo-
nents are shown in Figure 1. The ﬂexible display was cre-
ated from a soft PVC and has four 2” Flexpoint bidirectional
bend sensors attached to its back. These sensors are placed
in the top-left corner, top-right corner, bottom-left corner
and bottom-right corner of the display. The pico projector
is used to display a UI onto the ﬂexible display, and the con-
trol panel is used to start/stop the authentication process
on the ﬂexible display. The ﬂexible display and the con-
trol panel are connected to an Arduino Uno Microcontroller
which is connected to a computer running the software for
creating a gesture based password.
3.1.1 Creating a Password
Passwords on the ﬂexible display are created by perform-
ing a series of bend gestures. A set of 20 bend gestures are
available. Each corner of the display can be bent upwards
and downwards (8 gestures). Every two corners of the dis-
play can be bent upwards and downwards simultaneously
(12 gestures). Figure 2 shows how some of these gestures
can be performed. A standard password entry ﬁeld is pro-
jected onto the display, with an asterisk appearing with each
gesture (see Figure 3). Gesture passwords must have a min-
imum of 5 gestures (21.6 bits).
3.2 Mobile Phone
The mobile phone prototype was developed using Android
and allows users to create a PIN. The UI of this prototype
Figure 3: User Interface of the Flexible and mobile
phone prototype.
was designed to match the UI of the ﬂexible display proto-
type (see Figure 3). PINs must be at least 6 characters long
(19.9 bits).
4. USER STUDY
We are currently running a user study to evaluate the
usability and security of our proposed authentication mech-
anism. Participants are tested in two sessions. In the ﬁrst
session participants are asked to create a gesture based pass-
word on the ﬂexible display prototype and a PIN based pass-
word on the mobile phone prototype. These prototypes are
presented in a counterbalanced manner. Before creating a
password, participants are given a demonstration of how the
prototype works and are provided with an opportunity to
familiarize themselves with its functions. After creating a
password on each prototype, participants are asked to com-
plete several post-task questionnaires providing their opin-
ions and perceptions of the prototypes. After completing the
questionnaires, participants are asked to correctly re-enter
their password on each prototype ﬁve times. This allows
participants to rehearse their passwords which aids in mem-
orization.
The second session takes place a week later and evalu-
ates the memorability of the passwords created in the ﬁrst
session. Participants are asked to correctly re-enter their
passwords. Participants are given ﬁve tries to correctly re-
1470ous combinations that could be made, allowing for variety.
The device itself was pleasant to use, and bending it was
very easy once you became accustomed to it”, “That it is
new technology was a deﬁnite hurdle, but with familiarity
I believe it will be easy to learn and the gestures are fairly
simple“ and “At ﬁrst, I had diﬃculty with mastering my in-
tended password but after getting assistance, I determined
the problem I made and was able to register my password
successfully.”
Further analysis of the data from both sessions is ongoing.
5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented a password scheme for authen-
ticating users on ﬂexible display devices. We implemented
this password scheme on a ﬂexible display prototype and are
running a user study to evaluate the usability and security of
our system. Preliminary results from the ﬁrst session of our
study show that many users were able to easily create and re-
enter their passwords, although they took longer to re-enter
their gesture password than their PIN. This was mainly be-
cause users were using an early prototype of a ﬂexible display
which required careful handling. We believe that as ﬂexible
display prototypes improve in the future, password re-entry
time will improve as well. Our future work will look at data
from both sessions of the study. We will look at the security
and memorability of passwords created on the ﬂexible dis-
play as well as strategies and gestural patterns users employ
to create their passwords.

enter their passwords on each prototype. After completing
the password re-entry tasks, participants complete several
post-task questionnaires evaluating the memorability and
security of their passwords.
Quantitative data collected includes the time participants
took to complete each task, number of errors they made,
passwords they created, strength of the passwords, number
of tries taken to authenticate, and whether they were able
to remember their passwords. Qualitative data is collected
via post-task questionnaires.
4.1 Preliminary Results - Day 1
16 university students between the ages of 18 and 28 (M =
22, SD = 3.42) participated in the ﬁrst session of our study.
We analysed the time they took to re-enter their password
averaged across ﬁve tries. We found that participants took
longer to re-enter their password on the ﬂexible display (M =
31.2s, SD = 18.08) than the mobile phone (M = 7.2s, SD =
3.42). One reason for the longer times is that participants
were using an early prototype of a new technology which
required careful handling. In addition to this, participants
created new passwords on the ﬂexible display, but post-task
questionnaire data revealed that many created a known and
familiar PIN on the mobile phone despite being asked to
create something new. Therefore, participants had much
more practice re-entering their PIN and could re-enter it
faster than their password on the ﬂexible display.
Success scores on the password re-entry task were calcu-
lated by giving participants a score out of 5, depending on
the number of times they successfully re-entered their pass-
word. Figure 4 shows that most participants were able to
successfully re-enter their password in both conditions.
Data from the post-task questionnaires revealed that over-
all participants had a positive experience in using the ﬂexible
display prototype to create a password. Some of their com-
ments include “It’s very cool!”, “The ﬂexible device is user
friendly and will be easy device to use”, “There were vari-
