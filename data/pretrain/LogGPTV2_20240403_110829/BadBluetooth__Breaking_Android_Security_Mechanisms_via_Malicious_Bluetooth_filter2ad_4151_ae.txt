### Challenges in Bluetooth Device Identification and Security

#### Device Identification
iOS does not display specific icons when scanning nearby Bluetooth devices, and some Linux versions use a unified Bluetooth icon for all types of devices. This lack of differentiation can make it difficult for users to identify the true nature of a Bluetooth device. Additionally, profile authentication issues persist due to vague Bluetooth specifications. Similar to attacks on Android, a malicious insider could exploit these flaws to launch attacks. The success of such attacks depends on the specific Bluetooth resource management mechanisms on different platforms, making this an important area for future research.

#### Bluetooth Design
While concrete attacks can be mitigated, the fundamental design weaknesses identified in this paper cannot be fully addressed by Android alone. These design weaknesses should be fixed in the Bluetooth specifications over the long term. The current Bluetooth specification focuses heavily on functional diversity and transmission performance but often neglects security requirements, which are largely left to the discretion of device vendors.

We argue that the current Bluetooth standard's treatment of a device or host as a single entity is flawed. Modern smart devices, like smartphones, involve multiple parties and can act as platforms for installed apps, sharing all Bluetooth resources. Profile-level authentication is necessary, and a standardized verification procedure should be added. Furthermore, the device name and displayed icon are often the only indicators for users to distinguish between devices. However, neither the device name nor the icon is reliable. The operating system typically displays the icon based on the claimed device type, regardless of the profiles it contains. Therefore, a better mechanism is needed to help users verify the identity of a device.

#### Bluetooth Security
Early research on Bluetooth security focused on vulnerabilities in protocols and implementations. Early versions of Bluetooth were found to be susceptible to attacks such as sniffing, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and PIN cracking. On the Android platform, Naveed et al. discovered the security issue of external device mis-bonding, which could allow unauthorized apps to download sensitive user data. Similar vulnerabilities exist on iOS. Our attacks, however, aim to exploit various Bluetooth profiles to break the Android system.

In 2017, BlueBorne was discovered, containing eight zero-day Bluetooth vulnerabilities across multiple platforms. This attack could penetrate and take control of targeted devices without pairing. Unlike BlueBorne, our attacks do not rely on software bugs.

Recent research has also focused on the security of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). For example, Kolias et al. found that BLE Beacon devices are vulnerable to various attacks, including beacon hijacking, user profiling, and presence inference. Sivakumaran et al. discovered that some BLE devices allow unauthenticated reads and writes from third-party devices. SÅ‚awomir et al. demonstrated possible attacks on the GATT layer of the Bluetooth stack, and Ryan et al. presented techniques for eavesdropping on BLE conversations.

Additionally, some research has shown the feasibility of user tracking via Bluetooth. Das et al. found that many fitness trackers use unchanged BLE addresses while advertising, making it feasible to track users. Korolova et al. achieved cross-app user tracking through advertising packets broadcasted by nearby BLE-enabled devices. As a defense, Fawaz et al. proposed BLE-Guardian, a device-agnostic defense system that protects the privacy of users with BLE devices/IoTs.

In this paper, we target the latest Bluetooth stack and discover several high-level design weaknesses that could lead to severe consequences. These design flaws are not limited to a specific platform or OS version.

#### Peripheral Devices and Security
In addition to Bluetooth, previous works have revealed that many other peripheral devices can be exploited to attack their host computers, with USB peripherals being the most studied. Wang et al. introduced attacks targeting the physical USB connectivity between smartphones and computers. Maskiewicz et al. demonstrated the feasibility of attacking air-gapped peripherals using the Logitech G600 mouse. Su et al. exploited the electrical properties of USB hubs to achieve crosstalk leakage attacks.

In 2014, Nohl et al. proposed BadUSB, a comprehensive USB attack vector that can take any action on the host without authorization. To address this, Tian et al. presented GoodUSB, a defense solution that includes a permission model and a mediator to manage risks during the enumeration phase of the USB protocol. This model is based on the insight that a device's identity should align with the end user's expectation of its functionality. Other research, such as USBFILTER and ProvUSB, have followed this direction. Angel et al. proposed a virtualization-based solution that attaches peripheral devices to a logically separate, untrusted machine.

Tian et al. conducted a comprehensive survey on USB security, suggesting that most USB attacks abuse the trust-by-default nature of the USB ecosystem. A multi-layered defense solution is required for practical success. We believe that similar issues exist in the Bluetooth ecosystem, and research in the Bluetooth domain can benefit from the outcomes of USB security research.

### Conclusion

Bluetooth is essential for short-distance, low-power communications and is becoming more popular with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT). The security of Bluetooth devices is critical for protecting user privacy and personal safety. In this paper, we performed a systematic study of Bluetooth profiles and discovered five design weaknesses. We demonstrated the feasibility and potential damages of these flaws on Android, including information theft, app control, network sniffing, and voice command injection. We also designed a defense solution for Android to effectively prevent such attacks. These newly discovered flaws are not limited to a specific OS version; broad Android versions, from 5.1 to the latest 8.1, are vulnerable, and similar problems may appear on other OS platforms. These flaws stem from widely incorrect understandings and assumptions about the Bluetooth stack. We believe they are just the tip of the iceberg, and the Bluetooth standard needs a thorough security review.
