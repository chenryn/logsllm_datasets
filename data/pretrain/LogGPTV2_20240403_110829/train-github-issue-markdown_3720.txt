Trying to define an empty trait:
    trait Foo {}
produces a confusing message about `Self`:
    unnamed.rs:1:1: 1:13 error: parameter `Self` is never used
    unnamed.rs:1 trait Foo {}
                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~
    unnamed.rs:1:13: 1:13 help: consider removing `Self` or using a marker such as `core::marker::PhantomFn`
    error: aborting due to previous error
It appears that the compiler is internally treating the trait as though it had
a type parameter defined called `Self`, and then complaining about the
parameter being unused. But from the user's perspective there is no such
parameter, and the suggestion to remove it is nonsense. The error message
should be adjusted to recognize when it's complaining about `Self` and to
explain itself better.
