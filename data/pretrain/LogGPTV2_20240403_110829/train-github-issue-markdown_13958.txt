# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Imagine you need to search something very quickly using PowerToys Run. You
pressed `Alt` \+ `Space`, and you need to open your browser first then search
on url bar. but instead I think we might use PT Run to launch websites as well
as applications by typing some queries like: `bing microsoft build`. And it
opens bing search result for microsoft build.
To customize web search, user might define prefixes and query url for the
service.
Prefix | Url  
---|---  
`yt` | `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query={0}`  
`bing` | `https://www.bing.com/search?q={0}`  
`google` | `https://www.google.com/search?q={0}`  
I think users must be able to modify this list to add/edit/remove items.
For example when I type something like:
    bing microsoft career
It should open this url on my **default** browser:
    https://www.bing.com/search?q=microsoft+career
# Proposed technical implementation details
You could check out this wox plugin for example.
# Protip
_Aslo, a note for myself_
Power users could also use duckduckgo's "I'm feeling lucky" like service to
directly search and redirect to first item.
Prefix | Url  
---|---  
`web` | `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!ducky+{0}`

So when we execute queries like `web powertoys` it will open this repo on our
browser.
