# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

Imagine you need to quickly search for something using PowerToys Run. Currently, you might press `Alt` + `Space`, open your browser, and then perform a search in the URL bar. However, we propose enhancing PowerToys Run to allow users to launch web searches directly from the tool. For example, typing `bing microsoft build` would open the Bing search results for "microsoft build" in the user's default browser.

### Customizable Web Search
Users should be able to define and customize prefixes and corresponding URLs for various search services. Here is an example configuration:

| Prefix | URL |
| --- | --- |
| `yt` | `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query={0}` |
| `bing` | `https://www.bing.com/search?q={0}` |
| `google` | `https://www.google.com/search?q={0}` |

Users should have the ability to add, edit, or remove items from this list. For instance, typing `bing microsoft career` should open the following URL in the user's default browser:
```
https://www.bing.com/search?q=microsoft+career
```

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details
For implementation, you can refer to the Wox plugin as an example. The plugin should handle the parsing of the query, identify the prefix, and construct the appropriate URL. The URL should then be opened in the user's default browser.

### Pro Tip
Power users could also utilize a service similar to DuckDuckGo's "I'm Feeling Ducky" feature, which redirects directly to the first search result. Here is an example configuration for this:

| Prefix | URL |
| --- | --- |
| `web` | `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!ducky+{0}` |

For example, typing `web powertoys` would open the GitHub repository for PowerToys in the user's default browser.

This enhancement will streamline the search process and make PowerToys Run even more versatile and user-friendly.
