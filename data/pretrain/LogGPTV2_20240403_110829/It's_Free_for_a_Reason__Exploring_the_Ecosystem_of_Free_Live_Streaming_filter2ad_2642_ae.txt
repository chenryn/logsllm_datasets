Table V: Malicious extensions discovered during the analysis
of overlay ads displayed by the FLIS services.
Most of the websites offering malware were reached due
to a small number of advertisers providing overlay ads. The
right side of the Table IV shows the top 5 advertisers leading
to the malware website when clicked on the overlay ads. These
advertisers are either directly malicious or have been used as
intermediaries in the delivery of malicious ads.
Malicious extensions and their distributors. Table V lists
the 11 extensions we found from the ad websites opened after
clicking on the overlay ads using a Chrome speciﬁc user-
agent. The table also shows the percentage of redirections
to the ad websites presenting these extensions. Moreover, the
table presents the user base of each extensions as shown on
the Chrome web store. We can observe that some of these
extensions have millions of active victim users. We manually
analyzed these extensions and ﬂagged several malicious activi-
ties like ad-injection, hijacking new-tab pages, and injection of
malicious . Overall, our analysis ﬂagged most of
the extensions as malicious and few of them as suspicious.
It might be the case that the latter category are legitimate
extensions, but we consider this possibility highly unlikely,
as these extensions are neither particularly useful nor well
designed, yet have somehow amassed millions of installations.

H. Summary of Findings
By performing more than 850,000 visits on the identiﬁed
5,685 aggregator domains and by analyzing more than 1
Terabyte of trafﬁc, we found that the majority of the parties in
the FLIS ecosystem are hosting their infrastructure mostly in
Europe and Belize. For instance, we discovered that nearly
25% of live streams originates from the servers hosted in
Belize, and more than 60% of analyzed streams originates
from the media servers provided by only 5 companies located
in Belize, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada.
Additionally, we found that more than 64% of parties providing
these streams have been reported at least once for violating the
copyrights of content owners. Since only a handful of channel
providers are responsible for broadcasting the majority of the
live streams, we argue that a strict control on the operations of
these entities, can effectively minimize the volume of illegal
live streaming.
In addition, we found that 5-7% FLIS pages leverage
trademark names and logos of popular TV channels and sports
organizations to attract more visitors. Moreover, through a
series of experiments, we found that FLIS services do not
respect the standards for the online advertising. We discovered
that, on average, 93% of the video players on FLIS webpages
were stuffed with overlay ads, hiding more than 80% area
of the player. Furthermore, the displayed overlay ads found
in FLIS services are embossed with deceptive close buttons
to collect unintended clicks from visitors, leading to visitors
opening advertisement websites while trying to close these
overlays.
Figure 10 shows the redirection chains to the opened
websites, offering the discovered malicious extensions, after
clicking the overlay ads. The graph shows that some of the
domains, like lp.ilividnewtab.com, lp.gamesnewtab.com, can
be reached through several intermediate entities after a click on
an overlay ad. In other cases, we can observe a webpage, pre-
senting a malicious extension, being reached more directly, for
example, zwinky.com, retrogamer.com from a single advertiser
i.e., adcash.com. Overall, these interactions and intermediate
party redirections hide the direct association of the FLIS
services in serving the malicious browser extensions.
Finally, we examined the nature of websites opened when
users are deceived (or lured) into clicking on overlay ads.
On average, we found that 50% of ad-related websites are
malicious in nature, offering malware, malicious browser ex-
tensions, and all sorts of scam pages. At
the same time,
we discovered that some FLIS services are directly involved
in malware distribution via an Android application. Overall,
these practices, along with the frequent accusation of copyright
infringement, clearly show that FLIS services are inclined
towards intrusive and malicious monetization schemes, at the
expense of user security.

FLIS CLASSIFIER
Given the ever-increasing incidents of copyright violations
and discovered abuse, both against users as well as legitimate
content providers, it is clear that current FLIS services are a
rather parasitic part of the Web. As such, automatic detection
techniques are necessary to identify the aggregator webpages
serving viewers with an index of free streams, most of which
are commonly reported as illegal. To this end, we designed
and developed FLIS classiﬁer, a system that is able to perform
online detection of FLIS aggregator pages. Our data gathering
infrastructure (Section III-A) already demonstrated a real-
world utilization of our classiﬁer where we deployed it to
identify unknown FLIS pages. As an application, our classiﬁer
can readily be used by human analysts to ﬁnd unknown FLIS
websites that can then be analyzed for potential abuses.
We now describe the architecture of the FLIS classiﬁer by
providing details on feature extraction, implementation strate-
gies, and a performance evaluation on the gathered dataset.
A. Feature Extraction
When extracting features for the FLIS classiﬁer, we set
the following requirements: (1) features should target the look
and feel and modus operandi of the FLIS aggregator pages (for
accurate classiﬁcation), and (2) the feature extraction process
should be efﬁcient in terms of processing overhead. To this
end, we focus on extracting information from various live sport
streaming indicators, network trafﬁc, speciﬁc widgets, and
from the images found on a webpage. Speciﬁcally, we extract
ﬁve HTML features, three network trafﬁc features, two frame
features, and two image features. To extract these features,
we crawl a webpage using a crawler based on Selenium,
a testing framework for web applications, while storing the
HTML of every loaded  and  element,
collecting all images in the page, logging network trafﬁc, and
taking a screenshot of the webpage. For each crawled page,
the extracted features are incorporated in a feature vector. In
the following paragraphs, we provide details on the features
and our intuition for choosing them.
HTML features. This set of features is obtained by in-
terpreting the HTML code of every loaded  and
 in a webpage. As such, this set models information
from the look and feel of the aggregator pages.
(cid:5) Element text-to-global text ratio. Typically, the main body
of an aggregator page does not contain much text. The
majority of text found on these pages resides in speciﬁc
HTML elements, such as links and meta elements i.e., ,
, , . To exploit
this trait, we use the Python goose-extractor module [4] to
extract the text from link elements, meta elements, and the
main body. We then measure the ratio of text that is located
within the link and meta elements to the global amount of text
found on the page. We use this ratio as a numeric feature.
(cid:5) Number of indicative words in URLs. Aggregator pages
usually contain text in  elements and indexed URLs of
live streams, which generally represents numerous sports, TV
channels, and events between different countries or sports
clubs (e.g., /watch/baseball/foxsports.html). To
use this speciﬁc characteristic as a set of features, we compiled
four comprehensive word lists that contain several hundred
entries of different sports, countries, sports clubs, and sports
TV channels. We then use these lists to search for indicative
words in the visible text of  elements, and in normalized
text extracted from the URLs. We use a token extraction tech-
nique from [18] to extract the normalized text from URLs. For
example, /watch/baseball/foxsports.html would
be split into the tokens watch, baseball, foxsports,
and html. Finally, we count the occurrences of the indicative
words for each of the four categories on a webpage and include
the count values as a set of numeric features.
(cid:5) n-grams. In addition to indicative words, we also measure
the presence of FLIS representative word sequences (n-grams)
in a webpage. The intuition is that n-grams which appear much
more frequently in aggregator pages than in non-FLIS ones are
a good marker for FLIS aggregator pages (e.g., “watch free
live football streams” etc.). To this end, we extract n-grams
that vary from length n = 1 to n = 5 from the meta elements,
the visible text of  elements, and from any text found on
the main body of the known aggregator pages. Afterwards, we
select the top 1,000 n-grams by measuring their importance
in the known FLIS aggregator and non-FLIS pages using TF-
IDF [42]. Lastly, we measure the frequency of the selected
n-grams on a webpage and incorporate these frequencies as a
set of numeric features.
(cid:5) Presence of indicative widgets. We also inspect the presence
of FLIS indicative widgets on a webpage. These widgets are
stand-alone applications from particular third-parties which
are embedded into the aggregator webpage. Speciﬁcally, we
found that a certain type of aggregator webpages often contain
speciﬁc stream (like http://iﬁrstrow.eu/webmaster/ etc.), chat,
and clock widgets. Hence, presence of these widgets on a page
is a good indicator of the FLIS aggregator page. Therefore,
we compiled a list of indicative widgets’ URLs from the
known aggregator pages. We then use these lists to identify the
presence of FLIS indicative widgets in a page and incorporate
this knowledge as a set of boolean features.
(cid:5) Presence of reporting link. Aggregator domains typically
host a notice page for reporting of illegal streams indexed on
their websites. We observe that the visible text in the link
( element) of these notice pages usually has keywords
such as “dmca”, “noticetakedown”, “notice”, “report” etc. We
use these characteristics and compile a list of notice keywords
from the known aggregator pages. Afterwards, we use this list
to identify the presence of notice keywords in the visible text
of  elements of a webpage and use it as a boolean feature.
Network trafﬁc features. This set of features is extracted from
the network trace that is recorded while crawling a page. By
its very nature, this set models information from the modus
operandi of the FLIS aggregator pages.
(cid:5) Third-party request ratio. This feature deals with the third-
party content on the aggregator webpage. Aggregator pages
often include HTML content from third-party services, such as
the use of frames provided by channel providers, the overlay
ads etc. To incorporate this information as a numeric feature,
we measure the ratio of HTTP requests to third-parties (other
domains) compared to the total amount of the HTTP requests.
(cid:5) Presence of media trafﬁc. We observe that
is also
common for aggregator webpages to have a Flash player
embedded on the page along with the indexed streaming
links (as shown in Figure 6). The player broadcasts live sport
streams using a speciﬁc media protocol (e.g., RTMP etc.). To
it
12
capture this fact, we use the protocol signatures (described in
Section III-B) to detect the presence of the media trafﬁc and
incorporate this information as a boolean feature.
(cid:5) Non-standard port streaming. In connection with the pre-
vious feature, this feature indicates a presence of media-related
trafﬁc on non-standard ports. The rationale for incorporating
this information, is that FLIS services often use non-standard
ports for transmitting media trafﬁc using standard protocols
(e.g., RTMP on port 443 etc.). We expect that most non-FLIS
websites broadcast media trafﬁc using the standard protocol
ports. Thus, we include a boolean feature that indicates the
use of a non-standard protocol port for broadcasting streams.
Frame features. This set of features is extracted by analyzing
all loaded  and  elements on the aggre-
gator webpage, in an effort to further model the workings of
the FLIS aggregator pages.
(cid:5) Number of frames. The usage of  elements
to index streaming links, embed video players, show ads etc.
is very common in FLIS services. Thus, we incorporate this
characteristic, as a set of numeric features, by counting the
number of  and  elements found on a
page in combination with their child  elements, in a
recursive fashion.
(cid:5) Average and maximum nesting of frames. In addition to
the number of frames, we also include a set of numeric features
to measure the average and maximum level of nesting of any
given . The rationale is that most of the aggregator
pages include deeply nested  elements to display
ads on videos or to embed third-party stream widgets. We
expect non-FLIS websites to have fewer nested 
elements than the FLIS aggregator webpages.
Image features. This set of features aims to model information
from images on the FLIS aggregator pages, focusing on the
look of FLIS aggregator webpages.
(cid:5) Average and maximum image size. It is common for
aggregator pages to have several images of sports equipments,
ﬂags, sports clubs, and TV channel
logos. These images
are often placed alongside the indexed links of different TV
channels and sport streams. We observe that these images are
often small in size (on average 1.4 kilobytes) and account for
the majority of images on the aggregator webpages. Therefore,
we measure the average and maximum size of images found
on a webpage and incorporate these measurements as a set of
numeric features.
(cid:5) Ratio of indicative images. As discussed earlier, aggregator
pages make heavy use of images that belong to sports equip-
ments, country ﬂags, clubs, and TV channel logos. Thus, a
high ratio of these indicative images in comparison to all other
images on a webpage, is a good indicator of a FLIS aggregator
webpage. To measure the number of FLIS indicative images,
we ﬁrst extracted all the images from the known aggregator
pages. Next, we clustered these images using a perceptual hash
function (PHash) (as described in Section IV-E). Afterwards,
we manually inspect the clusters and remove all the irrelevant
clusters (i.e., banners etc.). At this point, all remaining clusters
belong to the FLIS-indicative image categories (i.e., sports
equipments, country ﬂags, TV channels and club logos). In
our approach, each cluster is expressed by a candidate PHash
value, which is representative of all images in it. Now, to
measure the ratio of FLIS indicative images, we extract all
the images from a page, compute their PHash values, and use
the Hamming distance as metric, between the candidate PHash
value of all the clusters and the PHash values of the extracted
images. If the distance between any of the extracted image’s
PHash and any candidate PHash value is less than 0.3, we label
the image as FLIS indicative. Finally, we measure the ratio of
the labeled FLIS indicative images to the other images found
