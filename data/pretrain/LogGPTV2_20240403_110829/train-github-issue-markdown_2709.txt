### Support and Issue Reporting for TensorFlow

For general help and support, please visit Stack Overflow:
- [TensorFlow Questions on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow)

If you need to open a GitHub issue, please adhere to the following policy:
1. The issue must be a bug report or a feature request.
2. You must fill out the form provided below.

**Policy Explanation:**
TensorFlow developers focus on issues that benefit the entire community, such as fixing bugs and adding features. General support requests are better handled on Stack Overflow. GitHub issues also notify thousands of users, so we prefer that they address interesting and relevant problems rather than redirecting to Stack Overflow.

### System Information
- **Custom Code:** Yes
- **OS Platform and Distribution:** Ubuntu 14.04
- **TensorFlow Installation Source:** Source
- **TensorFlow Version:** 1.2.0-rc0
- **Bazel Version (if compiled from source):** N/A
- **CUDA/cuDNN Version:** 8.0
- **GPU Model and Memory:** N/A
- **Exact Command to Reproduce:**
  ```python
  from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.learn_io import pandas_io
  import pandas as pd
  import tensorflow as tf
  import pdb
  tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.INFO)

  COLUMNS = ["crim", "zn", "indus", "nox", "rm", "age", "dis", "tax", "ptratio", "medv"]
  FEATURES = ["crim", "zn", "indus", "nox", "rm", "age", "dis", "tax", "ptratio"]
  LABEL = "medv"

  training_set = pd.read_csv("boston_train.csv", skipinitialspace=True, skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)
  # test_set = pd.read_csv("boston_test.csv", skipinitialspace=True, skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)
  # prediction_set = pd.read_csv("boston_predict.csv", skipinitialspace=True, skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)

  feature_cols = [tf.contrib.layers.real_valued_column(k) for k in FEATURES]
  regressor = tf.contrib.learn.DNNRegressor(feature_columns=feature_cols, hidden_units=[10, 10], model_dir="/tmp/boston_model")

  pd_input_fn = pandas_io.pandas_input_fn(training_set[FEATURES], y=training_set[LABEL], batch_size=128, target_column='medv')
  regressor.fit(input_fn=pd_input_fn, steps=5000)
  ```

### Problem Description
Please describe the problem clearly. Explain why it is a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.

I have encountered the following warnings, which are confusing and make me uncertain about the correctness of my code:

```
WARNING:tensorflow:Rank of input Tensor (1) should be the same as output_rank (2) for column. Will attempt to expand dims. It is highly recommended that you resize your input, as this behavior may change.
```

This warning appears multiple times during the execution.

WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/jiqiang/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/head.py:625: scalar_summary (from tensorflow.python.ops.logging_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30. Instructions for updating: Please switch to tf.summary.scalar. Note that tf.summary.scalar uses the node name instead of the tag. This means that TensorFlow will automatically de-duplicate summary names based on the scope they are created in. Also, passing a tensor or list of tags to a scalar summary op is no longer supported.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
