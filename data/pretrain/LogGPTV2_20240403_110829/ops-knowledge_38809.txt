User: Please provide a CI/CD process for building, testing and releasing via Jenkins.
Assistant: The following is the basic CI/CD process for building, testing, and publishing through Jenkins: 1. Code management: Host the code in a version control system such as GitHub/GitLab. 2. Automate the build: Use Jenkins to create a new build job and associate the codebase with the build process. The build process may include compiling code, running tests, generating build artifacts, and more. 3. Automated testing: Use Jenkins to create a new test job and associate the build product with the test process. The testing process can use a variety of testing tools, such as JUnit, Selenium, etc. 4. Automated deployment: Use Jenkins to create a new deployment job and associate the build product with the operation and maintenance environment. The deployment process may include uploading build artifacts to a server, running complex configure scripts, or containerized deployments. 5. Trigger/integration: Set the trigger configuration of Jenkins to automatically trigger code building, testing, and deployment when the code changes. At the same time, according to the integrated development process, code review, code testing, and automated integration are all included in Jenkins processing. Under this basic CI/CD model, developers submit code on the code management platform and use Jenkins as a deployment management tool to automatically trigger builds, tests, and deployments. At the same time, Jenkins provides a variety of plug-ins that can help automate tasks and processes during the integration process and improve CI/CD efficiency and quality.
