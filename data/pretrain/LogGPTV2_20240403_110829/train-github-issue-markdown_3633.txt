# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18363.778
    PowerToys version: v0.18.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): PowerToys Run
# Steps to reproduce
Well, it's just there. Using PowerToys Run, I search for an application
(Notion, executable `Notion.exe`) with or without .exe at the end. I don't get
this as a result when it is not running, and when it is running, it is always
the least prioritised, despite matching the exe name. (note - the window title
NEVER contains the word `Notion`)
# Expected behavior
Notion to appear to be launched when it is not, and when it is running it
should appear as the first result.
# Actual behavior
When I want to launch notion, PT Run doesn't find it at all, whereas Windows
Search does. See Figure 1.  
When I want to switch to it, it is consistently the last option. See Figure 2.
