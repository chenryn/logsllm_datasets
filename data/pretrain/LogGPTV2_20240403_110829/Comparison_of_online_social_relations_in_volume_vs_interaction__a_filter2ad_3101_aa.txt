**Abstract:**
Online social networking services are among the most popular Internet services, as evidenced by Alexa.com, and have become a key feature in many web services. Users interact through various features, such as forming friend relationships, sharing photos, and writing comments. These friend relationships are expected to be crucial for other web service features, including recommendation engines, security measures, online search, and personalization. However, there is limited knowledge about the actual interaction that takes place over declared online friend relationships. This study aims to address this gap by constructing an activity network from guestbook comments on Cyworld, where nodes represent users and directed edges represent comments. We compare the structural characteristics of the activity network with the explicit friend relationship network. Our findings indicate that while the activity network is weighted and directed, its structure is similar to the friend relationship network. The in-degree and out-degree distributions are close, and social interactions through guestbooks are highly reciprocated. When only reciprocated links are considered, the degree correlation distribution shows more pronounced assortativity than the friend network, aligning it with known social networks. K-core analysis further suggests that the friends network deviates from typical social networks, with an unusually large number of highly connected cores. By delving into the weighted and directed nature of the activity network, we investigate reciprocity, disparity, and network motifs, and observe that peer pressure to stay active online diminishes beyond a certain number of friends. The activity network provides deeper insights into user interaction, despite its topological similarity to the friend network.

**1. Introduction**
Online social networking services are among the most popular Internet services, according to Alexa.com, and have become a key feature in many web services. Major platforms like MySpace and Facebook, as well as other Web 2.0 services such as Flickr, Del.icio.us, and YouTube, offer social networking features. Through these features, users establish friend relationships, share photos, and write short messages. These relationships form the foundation for various applications, including recommendation engines, security measures, and personalization. Understanding these relationships is essential for developing these applications.

A friend relationship is an explicit and static declaration, but it may not fully represent actual user interaction. Once a friend relationship is established, activities such as viewing photos, reading articles, and leaving comments follow. Macroscopically, metrics like the number of users, daily visitors, and page views provide an overall view of the status of online social networking services (OSNSs). However, these metrics do not capture the quality of interaction between users.

In this paper, we shift the focus from the friend relationship network to the activity network to better understand online social networks. We construct an activity network from logs of actual interaction rather than declared relationships. Our main research questions are:
- Does the friend relationship reflect underlying user interaction? Do users interact only with their friends or explore the network more widely?
- How does information flow through the network? Do all users receive the same attention from their friends? How often do they interact, and is the interaction one-way or reciprocated?

We take a top-down approach, starting with network growth. The activity network is directed and weighted, with direction representing the flow of interaction and weight representing the amount of interaction. We compare the topological characteristics, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and degree correlation, of the two networks. We use reciprocity, disparity, and network motifs to investigate the unique characteristics of the activity network.

For our study, we use more than two years of guestbook logs from Cyworld, the largest online social networking site in Korea. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to analyze both the friend and activity networks, as friend lists are often private and data collected through crawling can be biased.

Previous work on activity networks includes phone-call networks and MSN messenger networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to compare the explicit friend relationship network and the implicit activity network.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe the guestbook logs and their specific features. In Section 3, we compare the topological characteristics of the friend and activity networks. In Section 4, we delve into the weighted and directed aspects of the activity network. In Section 5, we explore other activity-related aspects. In Section 6, we compile related work, and in Section 7, we conclude with a discussion on future work.

**2. Activity in Guestbook**
In this section, we describe the social network data used in our study. Cyworld, launched in 2001, is the largest online social network service in Korea. As of October 2007, the number of registered Cyworld users had surpassed 20 million, which is more than a third of the entire South Korean population.

When a user joins Cyworld, they are given a homepage (called minihompy) that includes an avatar, photo gallery, public diary, testimonial board, and guestbook. Users can establish friend relationships and share information with those friends. They can browse friends' photos, leave comments, read public diaries, and write testimonials. Some features, such as writing a testimonial and viewing photos, are often limited to established friends. The owner of the minihompy can configure the buttons and features, with some being read-only and others configurable. The guestbook, once included, is open to anyone, whether a friend or not, to write comments. Even non-registered users can visit and write on a guestbook. The guestbook is the most used feature in Cyworld, where friends and visitors leave greetings and updates. Figure 1 shows a screen capture of a typical interaction on a Cyworld guestbook.

Ahn et al. have analyzed the topological characteristics of bi-directional friend relationships in Cyworld. Once established, a friend relationship remains rigid, regardless of the actual relationship. In this work, we delve deeper into the social networking web and study the user interaction captured in the guestbook. Unlike a friend relationship, which is bi-directional, a message on a guestbook represents a directional interaction between users. On a guestbook, people write greetings, recent updates, and replies.

We obtained the complete guestbook logs of Cyworld from June 2003 to October 2005. This period is significant in Cyworld's development, as the number of users grew exponentially from 2 million to 16 million, and the friend relationship network began to show signs of densification. We investigate whether the growth in actual user interaction has kept up with the growth in sheer size. Our guestbook log consists of three-tuples: the writer, the guestbook owner, and the time of the comment. All user identifiers have been anonymized. As of October 2005, the number of Cyworld subscribers reached 16,146,817. Among these, 74.6% (12,048,186) had formed friend relationships, and 64.8% (10,476,604) had written or received a comment on a guestbook at least once during the log period. Compared to 381,602,530 friend relationships, the number of writer and guestbook owner pairs was larger: 537,970,431. Table 1 summarizes our dataset, with numbers in parentheses excluding self-written messages. We discuss these self-written messages in Section 2.2.

As the number of Cyworld subscribers grew almost tenfold between 2003 and 2005, guestbook activity also saw explosive growth. Figure 2 plots the number of Cyworld subscribers and relevant statistics. The top graph shows the total number of subscribers. The next two graphs, representing the cumulative number of guestbook writers (marked with squares) and users with friend relationships (marked with circles), crisscross around October 2004. The former could be larger because the guestbook is open to anyone, even if they are not a registered user or have not established a friend relationship. The bottom graph shows the number of guestbook writers per month. Initially, the number of guestbook users was small but quickly caught up with the total number of Cyworld users, surpassing the number of users with friend relationships, indicating it is the most used feature.

However, the monthly statistics of guestbook users started to show a slowdown in growth, suggesting a possible slowdown in Cyworld's overall growth. This trend is also observed in the growth rate of the number of guestbooks and messages per writer. Figure 3 shows the total number of guestbook comments and the number of writers over time.
