ABSTRACT
Online social networking services are among the most popular In-
ternet services according to Alexa.com and have become a key fea-
ture in many Internet services. Users interact through various fea-
tures of online social networking services: making friend relation-
ships, sharing their photos, and writing comments. These friend re-
lationships are expected to become a key to many other features in
web services, such as recommendation engines, security measures,
online search, and personalization issues. However, we have very
limited knowledge on how much interaction actually takes place
over friend relationships declared online. A friend relationship only
marks the beginning of online interaction.
Does the interaction between users follow the declaration of friend
relationship? Does a user interact evenly or lopsidedly with friends?
We venture to answer these questions in this work. We construct a
network from comments written in guestbooks. A node represents
a user and a directed edge a comments from a user to another. We
call this network an activity network. Previous work on activity
networks include phone-call networks [34, 35] and MSN messen-
ger networks [27]. To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt
to compare the explicit friend relationship network and implicit ac-
tivity network.
We have analyzed structural characteristics of the activity net-
work and compared them with the friends network. Though the
activity network is weighted and directed, its structure is similar to
the friend relationship network. We report that the in-degree and
out-degree distributions are close to each other and the social in-
teraction through the guestbook is highly reciprocated. When we
consider only those links in the activity network that are recipro-
cated, the degree correlation distribution exhibits much more pro-
nounced assortativity than the friends network and places it close
to known social networks. The k-core analysis gives yet another

corroborating evidence that the friends network deviates from the
known social network and has an unusually large number of highly
connected cores.
We have delved into the weighted and directed nature of the ac-
tivity network, and investigated the reciprocity, disparity, and net-
work motifs. We also have observed that peer pressure to stay ac-
tive online stops building up beyond a certain number of friends.
The activity network has shown topological characteristics sim-
ilar to the friends network, but thanks to its directed and weighted
nature, it has allowed us more in-depth analysis of user interaction.

INTRODUCTION
Online social networking services are among the most popular
Internet services according to Alexa.com and have become a key
feature in many Internet services. Not only online social network-
ing services (e.g., Myspace and Facebook) but also other major web
2.0 services (e.g., Flickr, Del.icio.us, and YouTube) offer social
networking features on their sites. Through various features of on-
line social networking services, users establish friend relationships,
share photos, and write short messages. The friend relationship lays
the foundation for other systems to build upon for recommendation
engines, cooperation-based security, online search, and other per-
sonalization functions. Understanding friend relationships is the
ﬁrst step towards achieving them.
A friend relationship is an explicit and static declaration of a
relationship. For actual interaction between users, the friend rela-
tionship may not be the best representation. The friend relationship
only marks a beginning of online interaction. Activities, such as
looking at friends’ photos, reading their articles, and leaving com-
ments on their guestbooks, follow once the friend relationship is
established. Macroscopically, the number of users, the number of
istered Cyworld users has surpassed 20 million, which is more than
a third of the entire South Korea population2.
daily visitors, and page views are the three most basic metrics to
measure the status of online social networking services (OSNSs) 1.
These metrics compose an overall view of livelihood of an online
social network service itself, but they do not provide any informa-
tion about the livelihood of interaction between users.
In this paper, we shift the focus regarding analysis of online so-
cial networks from a friends network to an activity network for
better understanding of online social networks. We construct an
activity network from logs of actual interaction rather than from
declared relationships. The two main sets of questions we raise in
this work are:
• Does the friend relationship reﬂect underlying user interac-
tion? Does a user interact only with one’s friends or explore
the social network more widely? If the social interaction
does not follow the friends network closely or evenly, track-
ing user interaction should become a core design feature in
any service site.
• How does information ﬂow through the network? Do all
users receive the same attention from their friends? How
often do they interact? Is the interaction one-way or recip-
rocated?
We take a top-down approach and begin our analysis with net-
work growth. The activity network built for the present work is
directed and weighted. The direction represents the ﬂow of in-
teraction and the weight the amount of interaction. We ﬁrst look
at the numbers of users in the friend and activity networks and
compare their growth over time. We then compare the topological
characteristics–namely, the degree distribution, the clustering co-
efﬁcient, and the degree correlation–of the two networks. We use
reciprocity, disparity, and network motifs to investigate the activ-
ity network’s unique characteristics in the form of a weighted and
directed graph.
For our work, we use more than two years of guestbook logs
from the largest online social networking site in Korea and build
a graph from the comments recorded in these logs. The friends
network is a complete set of friend relationships. Access to this data
set allows us unique opportunities otherwise not possible, as the
friend lists of some users are often kept private and data collected
by crawling contains unavoidable bias.
Previous work on activity networks includes phone-call networks
[34, 35] and MSN messenger networks [27]. Online social net-
works are unique in that they have this reference network of friends.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to compare the
explicit friend relationship network and implicit activity network.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2
we describe our guestbook logs and the features speciﬁc to our logs.
In Section 3 we compare the topological characteristics between
the friend and activity networks. We then delve further into the
weighted and directed aspects of the activity network in Section 4
and other activity-related aspects In Section 5.
In Section 6 we
compile related work and Section 7 concludes with a discussion on
future work.
2. ACTIVITY IN GUESTBOOK
In this section, we describe the social network data we use for
this study. Cyworld, launched in 2001, is the largest online social
network service in Korea. As of October 2007, the number of reg-
1Ranking sites, such as Alexa, Rankey, and Ranking, use these
metrics in their web site rankings.
Figure 1: Screen capture of user C’s guestbook
When a user joins Cyworld, one is given a homepage (called
minihompy) that contains an avatar, a photo gallery, a public di-
ary, a testimonial board, a guestbook, etc. A user can establish
friend relationships with other users and share information only
with those established relationships. Users browse through friends’
photos and leave comments. They read others’ public diaries and
write testimonials for those established friends. Some of the fea-
tures, such as writing a testimonial and viewing photos, are often
limited to only those with established online friend relationships.
The owner of the minihompy can choose the buttons or features on
one’s minihompy. Some features, such as the proﬁle and the diary,
are read-only, while access to other features are owner-conﬁgurable
except for the guestbook. Once the owner includes the guestbook
on the minihompy, then it is open to anyone to write, a friend or not.
Even a person not registered as a Cyworld user can still visit and
write a comment on a guestbook. The photo gallery and the bulletin
board can be conﬁgured to be writable by visitors, but many users
keep the default setting of write-by-owner-only. The guestbook is
the most used feature in Cyworld where friends and visitors leave
a note of greetings to the minihompy owner3. We include a screen
capture of a typical interaction on a Cyworld guestbook in Figure 1.
A comment writer’s name and avatar are displayed along with the
comment.
Ahn et al. have analyzed Cyworld’s topological characteristics
of bi-directional friend relationships [2]. Once established, a friend
2Upon joining, a new user must have its personal identiﬁcation
number (equivalent of U.S.’s social security number) veriﬁed. For-
eigners have special provisions for membership. All user accounts
on Cyworld map to real users, unless a user make an illicit use of
other people’s personal identiﬁcation numbers.
3We were offered logs of comments on the photo gallery and the
bulletin board of the same period, but they were far smaller than
guestbook logs.
relationship remains rigid regardless of the actual relationship [40].
It is an assertion that some relationship existed, currently active
or not. In this work, we delve deeper into the web of social net-
working and study the user interaction captured in the guestbook.
Unlike a friend relationship, which is bi-directional, a message on
a guestbook represents a directional interaction between users. On
a guestbook, people write greetings, recent updates, replies, and so
on.
We have obtained the complete guestbook logs of Cyworld from
June 2003 to October 20054. This period is very important in the
development of Cyworld, as the number of users grew exponen-
tially from 2 million to 16 million and the friend relationship net-
work began to show a sign of densiﬁcation [2]. In this work we in-
vestigate whether the growth in actual user interaction, a key aspect
of social networking services, has kept up with the growth in sheer
size. Our guestbook log consists of three-tuples:
the writer, the
guestbook owner, and the time of the guestbook comment. All user
identiﬁers have been anonymized. As of October 2005, the num-
ber of Cyworld subscribers reached 16, 146, 817. Among those
16 million users, 74.6% or 12, 048, 186 users have formed friend
relationships with others, and 64.8% or 10, 476, 604 users have
written or received a comment on a guestbook at least once dur-
ing the period of our guestbook logs. Compared to 381, 602, 530
friend relationships, the number of the writer and guestbook owner
pairs is larger: 537, 970, 431. Table 1 summarizes our dataset. The
numbers in the parentheses exclude messages written by the owner
of the guestbook on one’s own guestbook. We explain more about
this type of messages in Section 2.2.
As the number of Cyworld subscribers grew almost ten times be-
tween 2003 and 2005, its guestbook had also seen explosive growth
in activity. We plot the number of Cyworld subscribers and the
relevant statistics in Figure 25. The top graph represents the total
number of subscribers. The next two graphs crisscross each other
in about October 2004. The graph marked with a square represents
the cumulative number of guestbook writers, and that marked with
a circle the number of users with friend relationships. The former
could be larger than the latter, because the guestbook is open to
anyone. Even if a person has not established a friend relationship
with the guestbook owner or is not even a registered user of Cy-
world, one can still write on a guestbook. The bottom graph repre-
sents the number of guestbook writers in that month. The number
of guestbook users was very small at the beginning, but caught up
with the total number of Cyworld users fast. It surpassed the num-
ber of users with friend relationships, attesting that it is the most
used feature.
However, the monthly statistics of guestbook users started to
abate in growth. Here we observe a hint of slow-down in Cyworld
growth. The slow-down tendency is also observed in the growth
rate of the number of guestbooks and messages per writer. Figure 3
shows the total number of guestbook comments and the number of
