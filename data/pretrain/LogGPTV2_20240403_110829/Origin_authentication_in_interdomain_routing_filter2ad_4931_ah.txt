discrete. Authenticated delegation lists are signiﬁcantly more ex-
pensive that the other schemes because each UPDATE must be ac-
companied with a complete proof. Most delegations are made by
one of a few entities, and hence, are part of naturally large proofs.
All other proofs are of a relatively constant size, which are small
with respect to authenticated delegation lists.
Not shown, off-line bandwidth costs are nominal. No period con-
sumed more than 100k of bandwidth for any construction, and most
less than 10k. This stands to reason: very few proofs (10s) are val-
idated in any period. The only exception this was a spike of several
hundred kilobytes of data associated with simple proofs and the au-
thenticated tree scheme. This spike was a result of a large block of
deaggregated addresses. As a result, the veriﬁer had to continually
acquire (but not verify) many proofs.
A third set of tests sought to evaluate the degree to which caching
can improve performance. The delegation graph deﬁned in the pre-
ceding section contains 114,183 delegations. Caching all proofs
for these delegations requires 13.4M cache for simple attestations,
1.2M for authenticated delegation lists, 4.0M for AS authenticated
delegation lists, and 4.7M for authentication delegation trees.
Figures 6 and 7 show the computational costs associated with
each scheme under varying cache sizes over a two hour period
(4:40pm-9pm). The 100 megabyte cache far exceeds the size of the
proofs, and hence measures only new proofs (the test starts with
a cold cache the preceding midnight). Medium sized caches sizes
(1M and 100k) are effected by reference locality. The most no-
table aspect of these graphs is the degree to which the tree scheme
outperform others. This is due to two factors: the structure of the
delegation graph and the use of succinct proofs. Because 16 proofs
encompass 80% of the delegations, the associated signatures are
likely to be present in cache. Because of their size, the succinct
proofs are likely to remain in the cache.
After removing the load associated with organization to AS del-
egation (the leaf delegation in the graph), authenticated delegation
lists were shown to out-perform AS authenticated delegation lists.
This is again due to delegation density: an AS is likely to see
many delegations from a single organization within some tempo-
ral bounds, regardless of to whom they are delegated. More gener-
ally, this demonstrates that delegator-centric solutions are the well
suited to current BGP UPDATE trafﬁc.
These results lead to a new cache strategy for aggregate proof
schemes: caching organization to organization delegation proof
signatures only. A complete cache of these signatures would be
just over 200 kilobytes. Because veriﬁcation would perform as if
all proofs were previously cached, the computational cost could be
signiﬁcantly reduced. This would mitigate the thrashing effect of
large proof approaches on small caches (lists). However because
they already offer a solution close to optimal caching, it would be
of little added beneﬁt tree based solutions. We will consider these
and other strategies (e.g., LFU caching disciplines) in future work.
6.3 Approximation Sensitivity
Assume that our approximation of the delegation graph is com-
pletely wrong: the IP address delegation graph changes frequently
and contains no nodes of high degree (e.g., low delegation den-
sity). This would indicate that address space ownership is highly
ﬂuid and fragmented. This is counter to almost all studies of BGP,
and would signal larger problems with interdomain routing. Such
features, if true, would markedly increase the size of BGP tables,
increase the BGP load, and prevent timely convergence (e.g., in the
limit aggregation becomes useless). This does not seem likely.
Now assume the more likely event that we have underestimated
the number of ownership sources and delegations in the Internet.
This is almost certainly true – we have worked from incomplete
information about organizational delegation. We argue this is a
reﬂection of the BGP data itself: providers and registries hand out
blocks to organizations, not ASes. However, operational evidence
strongly suggests that it is infrequently the case that the address
space is further delegated. Hence, we claim that the approximation
is of a high enough quality to draw general conclusions.
The effect of a larger body of ownership sources and number
of delegations will effect our results quantitatively but not qual-
itatively. Lesser delegation densities close the performance gap
between the different designs. Similarly, a larger number of del-
egations will only serve to scale up resource costs on all schemes.
In both cases, the wide gulf between measured costs signals that
even a gross approximation is sufﬁcient to characterize the con-
structions.
7. CONCLUSIONS
The lack of security in interdomain routing protocols is increas-
ingly recognized as an important problem. An important aspect
of any comprehensive approach is the means by which it performs
origin authentication. An origin authentication service traces and
validates the delegation of address usage from authorities to organi-
zations, and ultimately to the ASes which originate them. Previous
works have identiﬁed simple solutions, but no work has deﬁned
and generalized origin authentication or evaluated solutions using
a complete picture of delegation on the Internet.
This paper has developed a broad understanding of the issues,
designs, and practicality of origin authentication services. This
work is composed of three serial efforts: formalization, modeling,
and simulation. We initially formalized the semantics of address
advertisements and proofs of delegation. Broad classes of origin
authentication services are deﬁned by extending existing crypto-
graphic proof systems. We classify the current delegation of IPv4
address space by modeling the address delegation graph from cur-
rent interdomain routing data and public registry information. An
analysis of this graph shows that the current delegation on the In-
ternet is largely static and dense: 16 entities perform 80% of the
address delegation. The OAsim simulator uses our approximate
delegation graph and BGP announcements to compute the resource
consumption of origin authentication services. Our simulation ex-
periments show that resource costs can be signiﬁcantly reduced by
using proof systems centered on the delegator organizations and
ASes. Experiments of these systems show that resource costs can
be reduced by up to an order of magnitude over proposed solutions.
Such results indicate that on-line origin authentication may now be
in the realm of possibility.
Securing the current interdomain routing infrastructure is likely
to be a lengthy process. The security and networking communi-
ties must continually reevaluate the assumptions and environments
upon which the solutions are based. Work such as this serve as im-
portant contributions to this process. : a thorough understanding of
the trade-offs inherent to these services is essential. As was a chief
motivation of this work, such understanding must be grounded in
current realities of the Internet. It is only through the cumulative
force of this and similar works that the energy barrier of interdo-
main routing security can be breached.
