I wanted Node Typings in my Typescript project so I entered this command:
npm install @types/node --save  
Which resulted in:
    error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.
    Variable 'require' must be of type 'Require', but here has type 'NodeRequire'.
My machine had node version 7.0.3 The installed types was for version +
@types/PI:EMAIL  
If I uninstall the typings my project compiles with no problems.
It appears as if the typings content is not correct per the error message!  
The failing line of code in index.d.ts

This is the TSConfig content:
        "compilerOptions": {
            "module": "amd",
            "moduleResolution": "node",
            "target": "es5",
            "noImplicitAny": false,
            "jsx": "react",
            "sourceMap": false,
            "baseUrl": ".",
            "paths": {
                "OfficeFabric/*": [
                    "node_modules/office-ui-fabric-react/lib-amd/*"
                ]
            }
        } 
    }
Typescript version is 2.2.2
Root Cause: Require.js had a var named Require in it's index.d.ts, and so did
Node.js in it's index.d.ts. Renaming one of them fixed the problem. But there
is the --types option for TSConfig too.
