After installing python binary  
**python-2.7.1.amd64.msi** from python.org  
the install of  
**numpy-1.5.0-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe**  
fails with error:''  
Python 2.7 required, which was not found in the registry.''
Reinstalling python, using different versions of python etc. does not help.  
Python runs fine.  
(Is this the right place to report this?)
