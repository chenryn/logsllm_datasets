After installing the Python binary **python-2.7.1.amd64.msi** from python.org, the installation of **numpy-1.5.0-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe** fails with the following error message:

```
Python 2.7 required, which was not found in the registry.
```

Reinstalling Python and trying different versions of Python did not resolve the issue. Python itself runs without any problems.

Is this the correct place to report this issue?
