# G0085: FIN4
## Description
FIN4 is a financially motivated threat group that has been active since at least 2013, targeting confidential information related to the public financial market, particularly in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors. (Citation: FireEye Hacking FIN4 Dec 2014) (Citation: FireEye FIN4 Stealing Insider NOV 2014) Unlike many other threat groups, FIN4 does not typically deploy persistent malware. Instead, they focus on capturing credentials that allow them to access email and other non-public correspondence.

| macOS, Windows | [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/credential-access/) | [Input Prompt](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1141/) | FIN4 presents victims with spoofed Windows Authentication prompts to collect their credentials. | Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters, User interface, PowerShell logs |
| Windows, macOS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS | [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/initial-access/) | [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192/) | FIN4 uses spearphishing emails, often sent from compromised accounts, containing malicious links. | Packet capture, Web proxy, Email gateway, Detonation chamber, SSL/TLS inspection, DNS records, Mail server |
| Windows, Office 365 | [Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/collection/) | [Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/) | FIN4 accesses and hijacks email communications using stolen credentials. | Office 365 trace logs, Mail server, Email gateway, Authentication logs, File monitoring, Process monitoring, Process use of network |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | [Command and Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/command-and-control/) | [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1188/) | FIN4 uses Tor to log in to victims' email accounts. | Network protocol analysis, Netflow/Enclave netflow |
