### SSL Certificate Scans and Fingerprint Application

We conducted SSL certificate scans using ZMap [74] and collaborated with a team at TU Munich [75], who applied our fingerprints to their SSL scanning data. Across all these sources, we identified 31,345 indicator hits, corresponding to 555 IP addresses in 48 countries.

One SSL certificate, issued by “/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl,” was returned by 175 of the servers. This certificate appears to reference the name of the spyware and the company. Servers for 5 of our FSBSpy samples and 2 of our RCS samples responded with this type of certificate.

Some servers returned these certificates in chains that included another distinctive certificate. We found 175 distinct IP addresses (including the C&C's for 5 of our FSBSpy samples and 2 of our RCS samples) that responded with this second type of certificate.

We developed two additional indicators: one that matched 125 IP addresses, including 7 of our FSBSpy samples' C&C's, and another that matched 2 IP addresses, located in Italy and Kazakhstan.

### Server Locations and Hosting Providers

On November 4, 2013, we probed all the collected IP addresses and found 166 active addresses matching one of our fingerprints in 29 different countries. The top countries and hosting providers are summarized in Table 5.

| **Country** | **IPs** | **Provider** | **IPs** |
|-------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| United States | 61 | Linode | 42 |
| United Kingdom | 18 | NOC4Hosts | 16 |
| Italy | 16 | Telecom Italia | 9 |
| Japan | 10 | Maroc Telecom | 7 |
| Morocco | 7 | InfoLink | 6 |

**Table 5: Top Countries and Hosting Providers for RCS Servers Active on November 4, 2013**

The prevalence of active servers located in the USA or hosted by Linode is notable and suggests extensive use of out-of-country web hosting and VPS services.

### Additional Findings

1. **HT Public Subnet**: We found 3 IP addresses on a /28 subnet named "HT public subnet," registered to the CFO of Hacking Team [76]. The domain hackingteam.it resolves to an address in this range.
2. **Oman**: An address belonging to Omantel, a majority-state-owned telecom in Oman, was unreachable when we probed it. A researcher pointed us to an FSBSpy sample containing an Arabic-language bait document about Omani poetry, which communicated with a C&C in the UK.
3. **Maroc Telecom**: 7 IP addresses belonged to Maroc Telecom. Moroccan journalists at Mamfakinch.com were previously targeted by RCS in 2012 [77].
4. **Authoritarian Regimes**: Overall, servers in 8 countries with governments deemed "authoritarian regimes" [69] were identified: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, UAE, and Uzbekistan.

### Link to Hacking Team

All active servers matching one of our signatures responded uniquely to specific ill-formed HTTP requests, returning “HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request” (with a typo in the protocol version) and a body of “Detected error: HTTP code 400.” A Google search for this response led us to a GitHub project, em-http-server [78], a Ruby-based web server. The project’s author is listed as Alberto Ornaghi, a software architect at Hacking Team. This suggests that the Hacking Team C&C server code may incorporate code from this project.

### Links Between Servers

We identified multiple instances where several servers hosted by different providers and in different countries returned identical SSL certificates matching our fingerprints. Additionally, 30 active servers used a global IPID. Only one active server did not have either a global IPID or an SSL certificate matching our fingerprints. To determine if servers returning SSL certificates were forwarding traffic to servers with global IPIDs, we induced bursts of traffic and monitored the IPID. For 11 servers, we found that activity correlated with bursts sent to other servers. We grouped servers by the SSL certificates they returned and found that each group forwarded to only a single server, except for one case where a group forwarded to two different IPs (both in Morocco). Two groups forwarded to the same address, and there was a 1:1 mapping between the remaining 8 addresses and groups. We refer to a group along with the server(s) it forwards to as a server group.

### Country-Specific Analysis

- **Turkey**: We identified a group containing 20 servers in 9 countries. Two RCS and 5 FSBSpy samples from VirusTotal communicated with various servers in the group. The RCS samples also communicated with domains with lapsed registrations, so we registered them to observe incoming traffic. We exclusively received RCS traffic from Turkish IP addresses. A sample of FSBSpy, apparently installed from an exploit on a Turkish server, communicated with one of the servers in this group [79].

- **Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan**: We found server groups containing servers in these countries. FSBSpy samples on VirusTotal, uploaded from these countries, communicated with servers in these groups.

In the cases of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the countries are classified as "authoritarian regimes" and may be using Hacking Team products against the types of targets profiled in this paper. In the case of Turkey, there are indications that the tool may be employed against dissidents [80].

### Summary

Targeted surveillance by nation-states poses a significant security challenge due to the imbalance of resources and expertise between victims and attackers. We have outlined the nature of this problem space based on reports from targeted individuals in three Middle Eastern countries. The attacks include spyware for ongoing monitoring and the use of "IP spy" links to deanonymize dissenters.

While some attacks incorporate effective social engineering, they generally lack novel technical elements and employ prepackaged tools from vendors or the cybercrime underground. These tools sometimes suffer from amateurish mistakes (e.g., cryptographic errors, broken protocol messages), as does their deployment (e.g., identifying information embedded in binaries, discoverable C&C servers, clusters of attack accounts tied by common activity). Some of these errors assisted our efforts to gather strong circumstantial evidence of governmental origins. We also mapped the global use of two "governmental" hacking suites, identifying 11 cases in which they appeared to be used in countries governed by "authoritarian regimes."

Our aim is to inspire further research addressing the difficult problem of protecting individuals with limited resources against powerful adversaries. Open questions include robust, practical detection of targeted attacks designed to exfiltrate data from a victim’s computer, as well as detection of and defense against novel attack vectors like tampering with Internet connections to insert malware.

The task is highly challenging, but the stakes are very high. An opposition member, reflecting on government hacking in Libya, speculated why some users would execute files even while recognizing them as potentially malicious [2]: “If we were vulnerable, we couldn’t care less... we were desperate to get our voices out... it was a matter of life or death... it was just vital to get this information out.”
