#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
    # Your code here
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_excel('Financial Sample.xlsx')

#### Problem description
My excel sheet has a column in which people can enter number of words but when
i am reading it through pandas it is only taking up to 45 characters and the
rest of it is printed as ". . ."
[this should explain **why** the current behaviour is a problem and why the
expected output is a better solution.]
**Note** : We receive a lot of issues on our GitHub tracker, so it is very
possible that your issue has been posted before. Please check first before
submitting so that we do not have to handle and close duplicates!
**Note** : Many problems can be resolved by simply upgrading `pandas` to the
latest version. Before submitting, please check if that solution works for
you. If possible, you may want to check if `master` addresses this issue, but
that is not necessary.
For documentation-related issues, you can check the latest versions of the
docs on `master` here:

If the issue has not been resolved there, go ahead and file it in the issue
tracker.
#### Expected Output
The pandas ecel reader should read the whole cell in the excel file
