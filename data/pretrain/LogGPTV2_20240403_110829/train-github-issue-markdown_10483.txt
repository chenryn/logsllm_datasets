##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
lib/ansible/modules/clustering/consul_kv.py
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
ansible 2.3.0.0  
ansible 2.4.0.0
##### SUMMARY
Currently the `consul_kv` module does not provide any extra diff output (when
running ansible with the so useful `--diff` option).  
Diff output (we could make it optional, by an extra optional parameter like
'diffView') should be easy to add using the `module.exit_json` `diff` return
attribute containing both the old and new value for the updated key, in
following fashion:
        index, existing = consul_api.kv.get(key)
        ...
        # to support diff-mode, just need following block:
        if existing and existing['Value']:
            ansible_diff = {'before': existing['Value'],  'after': value}
        else:
            ansible_diff = None
        module.exit_json(changed=changed,
                         index=index,
                         key=key,
                         data=stored,
                         diff= ansible_diff
    )
Note: ~~Untested code~~  
Update: I've already tested the new `--diff` successfully in a duplicated
consul_kv.py file. TODO make a PR etc
