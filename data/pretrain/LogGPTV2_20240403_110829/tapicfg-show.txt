### `tapicfg show` Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `tapicfg show` command displays the names and locations of the TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface) application directory partitions in the domain.

**Syntax:**
```
tapicfg show [/defaultonly] [/domain:<DNS_name>] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/defaultonly**
  - Displays only the name and location of the default TAPI application directory partition in the domain.
  
- **/domain:<DNS_name>**
  - Specifies the DNS name of the domain for which the TAPI application directory partitions are displayed. If this parameter is not provided, the command uses the local domain by default.
  
- **/?**
  - Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- This command-line tool can be executed on any computer that is a member of the domain.
- User-supplied text, such as the names of TAPI application directory partitions, servers, and domains, with international or Unicode characters, will only display correctly if the appropriate fonts and language support are installed.
- You can still use Internet Locator Service (ILS) servers in your organization if ILS is required to support certain applications. TAPI clients running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 can query either ILS servers or TAPI application directory partitions.
- The `tapicfg` tool can be used to create or remove service connection points. If the TAPI application directory partition is renamed (e.g., due to a domain rename), you must remove the existing service connection point and create a new one with the updated DNS name. Otherwise, TAPI clients will not be able to locate and access the TAPI application directory partition. Service connection points can also be removed for maintenance or security reasons, such as when you do not want to expose TAPI data on a specific partition.

**Example:**
To display the name of the default TAPI application directory partition for a specified domain, use the following command:
```
tapicfg show /defaultonly /domain:example.com
```

This will list the default TAPI application directory partition for the `example.com` domain.
