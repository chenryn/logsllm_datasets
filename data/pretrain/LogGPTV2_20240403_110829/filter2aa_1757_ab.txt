### Personal Jurisdiction in New York

For defendants to be subject to personal jurisdiction in New York, it is generally required that they be physically present in the state while committing the alleged tortious acts. However, this requirement is not definitively settled under New York law. Defendants argue that physical presence is not necessary, while plaintiffs contend otherwise.

#### Case Law: Davidoff v. Davidoff
**Case:** *Davidoff v. Davidoff*, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1307 (NY Sp Ct May 10, 2006)

**Citation:** *Banco Nacional Utramarino v Chan*, 169 Misc. 2d 182, 641 N.Y.S.2d 1006 [Supreme Court New York County 1996], affirmed in, 240 A.D.2d 253, 659 N.Y.S.2d 734 [1st Dept 1997]

**Ruling:** The court held that requiring a defendant to be physically present in New York to commit a tortious act would ignore the realities of modern technology. The emphasis should be on the location where the tort occurred, not whether the defendant was physically present. If the court finds that the tort occurred within the state, it should consider the totality of the circumstances to determine if jurisdiction should be exercised.

#### Case Law: Davidoff v. Davidoff (Continued)
**Case:** *Davidoff v. Davidoff*, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1307 (NY Sp Ct May 10, 2006)

**Facts:** The plaintiff claimed that the damage to their website information was felt in New York. However, the court found that the relevant inquiry is whether a tortious act occurred in New York. The act of damaging the website occurred in Florida, where the defendants were located and accessed the website's hosting company.

**Ruling:** The mere fact that the posting appears on the website in every state does not give rise to jurisdiction in every state. The result might have been different if the defendants had interfered with information on a server physically situated in New York. Since the server was in Florida, the court held that the defendants' actions did not reach into New York.

### General Jurisdiction and Internet Activities

#### Case Law: McCague v. Trilogy Corp.
**Case:** *McCague v. Trilogy Corp.*, 2007 WL 839921 (E.D. Pa. Mar 15, 2007)

**Facts:** The plaintiff, Anthony McCague, went whale watching with a charter boat company in Hawaii and suffered injuries. He sued the company in Pennsylvania, alleging negligent operation in rough seas.

**Ruling:** The court held that there was no personal or general jurisdiction over the defendants. The issue was whether the company's websites, accessible in Pennsylvania, constituted a continuous or systematic part of the company's business sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. There are no United States Supreme Court or Third Circuit cases deciding whether an internet website can establish general personal jurisdiction. One district court has used a sliding scale, finding jurisdiction proper if the website is "interactive" but not if it is passive. The court found that the company's website was neither wholly passive nor interactive and did not specifically target Pennsylvanians.

### Criminal Jurisdiction and Internet Activities

#### Case Law: Hageseth v. Superior Court of San Mateo County
**Case:** *Hageseth v. Superior Court of San Mateo County*, --- Cal.Rptr.3d ----, 2007 WL 1464250, Cal.App. 1 Dist. (May 21, 2007)

**Facts:** John McKay, a Stanford freshman, ordered Prozac from an overseas online pharmacy without a prescription. Dr. Christian Hageseth, located in Colorado, authorized the prescription without speaking to McKay. McKay later died of carbon monoxide poisoning, with Prozac in his system.

**Ruling:** The San Mateo County District Attorney filed a criminal complaint against Hageseth for practicing medicine in California without a license. The court held that even though Hageseth was never physically present in California, he could be subject to criminal jurisdiction because his actions caused the detrimental effect that the law was designed to prevent.

### Electronic Evidence and Search Warrants

#### Case Law: In the Matter of the Search of Yahoo, Inc.
**Case:** *In the Matter of the Search of Yahoo, Inc.*, 2007 WL 1539971 (D.Ariz May 21, 2007)

**Ruling:** The court found that 18 U.S.C. ยง 2703(a) authorizes a federal district court to issue search warrants for electronically-stored evidence located in another district, provided the alleged crime occurred in the issuing district. The warrant must comply with FRCP 41, but FRCP 41(b) does not limit the authority to issue out-of-district warrants under ยง 2703(a).

### Unauthorized Practice of Law via Web-Based Software

#### Case Law: In re Reynoso
**Case:** *In re Reynoso*, 477 F.3d 1117 (9th Cir. N.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2007)

**Facts:** The vendor provided bankruptcy software that went beyond mere clerical preparation, offering legal expertise and guidance.

**Ruling:** The court found that the vendor qualified as a bankruptcy petition preparer, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. The software chose where to place the user's information, selected exemptions, and provided legal citations. The Ninth Circuit limited its holding to the facts of the case, noting that the combination of the expert program and misleading statements on the website exposed the vendor to claims of practicing law without a license.

### Communications Decency Act and ISP Liability

#### Case Law: Universal Communication Systems, Inc. v. Lycos, Inc.
**Case:** *Universal Communication Systems, Inc. v. Lycos, Inc.*, --- F.3d ----, 2007 WL 549111, (1st Cir. Mass. February 23, 2007)

**Facts:** Plaintiffs brought suit against Lycos, Inc., for allegedly false and defamatory postings on an internet message board.

**Ruling:** Under the Communications Decency Act (47 U.S.C. ยง 230), entities like Lycos that facilitate the speech of others on the internet are granted broad immunity. The court held that Lycos was not liable for the content posted by users.

#### Case Law: Fair Housing Council v. Roommates.com
**Case:** *Fair Housing Council v. Roommates.com*, --- F.3d ----, 2007 WL 1412650 (9th Cir. C.D. Cal. May 15, 2007)

**Ruling:** The court held that Roommates.com, as a provider of an interactive computer service, is immune from liability for publishing information provided by its members. However, if Roommates.com is responsible for creating or developing the information, it becomes a content provider and loses CDA immunity.

### Seizures and Fourth Amendment Rights

#### Case Law: In re Forgione
**Case:** *In re Forgione*, 2006 Conn. Super. LEXIS 81 (January 6, 2006)

**Facts:** Family members moved for the return of unlawfully seized computer items and internet subscriber information, asserting that the searches and seizures were improper.

**Ruling:** The court found that, using the totality of the circumstances test, there was sufficient probable cause for the issuance of the search warrants. The family members did not have an expectation of privacy in the subscriber information, as it was voluntarily divulged to the internet service provider.

### Third-Party Consent in Computer Searches

#### Case Law: U.S. v. Rader
**Case:** *U.S. v. Rader*, 65 M.J. 30 (U.S.C.C.A. May 04, 2007)

**Facts:** The roommate consented to the search of the accused's non-password-protected computer.

**Ruling:** The court held that the roommate had sufficient access and control over the computer to give valid consent to its search. The computer was located in the roommate's bedroom, was not password-protected, and the accused had never told the roommate not to access it.

#### Case Law: U.S. v. Buckner
**Case:** *U.S. v. Buckner*, 473 F.3d 551 (4th Cir. W.D. Vir. Jan 7, 2007)

**Facts:** Michelle Buckner gave oral consent to seize the computer, which was used by her husband, Frank, who had password-protected files.

**Ruling:** The court found that Michelle had apparent authority to consent to the search. The investigation focused on Michelle, and there was no indication that the files were password-protected. The officers could not rely on apparent authority to intentionally avoid discovery of passwords or encryption.

#### Case Law: U.S. v. Andrus
**Case:** *U.S. v. Andrus*, 483 F.3d 711 (10th Cir. D. Kan. April 25, 2007)

**Facts:** The investigation focused on Ray Andrus, who was identified through email records. The police conducted a knock-and-talk at the house, and Dr. Andrus, Ray's brother, answered the door.

**Ruling:** The issue was whether Dr. Andrus had sufficient access and control to give valid consent to the search. The court considered the totality of the circumstances to determine if third-party consent was valid.
