present in New York when committing their alleged tortious acts in 
order to be subject to personal jurisdiction in New York . 
 Defendants maintain otherwise. 
 New York law is unsettled as to whether defendants' physical 
presence in New York while committing the tortious act is a 
prerequisite to jurisdiction.
Jurisdiction
 Davidoff v. Davidoff, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1307 (NY 
Sp Ct May 10, 2006)
 Citing, Banco Nacional Utramarino v Chan, 169 Misc. 2d 182, 
641 N.Y.S.2d 1006 [Supreme Court New York County 1996], 
affirmed in, 240 A.D.2d 253, 659 N.Y.S.2d 734 [1st Dept 1997],
 to allow a defendant to conspire and direct tortious activities in 
New York, in furtherance of that conspiracy, and then avoid 
jurisdiction because it directs those activities from outside the 
State . . . , is to ignore the reality of modern banking and 
computer technology in the end of the 20th century! A defendant 
with access to computers, fax machines, etc., no longer has to 
physically enter New York to perform a financial transaction 
which may be . . . tortious, i.e., conversion. . . . The emphasis 
should be on the locus of the tort, not whether defendant was 
physically here when the tortious act occurred. Once the court 
finds that the tort occurred within the State, it should look at the 
totality of the circumstances, to determine if jurisdiction should 
be exercised.
Jurisdiction
 Davidoff v. Davidoff, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1307 (NY Sp ct 
May 10, 2006)
 Although the alleged damage to plaintiff's information on the Website 
was "felt" by plaintiff in New York, it is insufficient that the damages 
were felt by plaintiff in New York. The relevant inquiry is whether a 
tortious act occurred in New York. The act of damaging the Website at 
best, occurred in Florida, where defendants were located when they 
typed on their computer and accessed the Website's Hosting Company 
in Florida. In the context of the internet, the content of plaintiff's 
Website cannot be deemed to be located wherever the content may be 
viewed, for jurisdictional purposes, as it has been held that the mere
fact that the posting appears on the website in every state will not give 
rise to jurisdiction in every state (emphasis added) (see Seldon v Direct 
Response Tech., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5344 [SDNY 2004]).
 The result may have been different if the defendants tapped into and 
interfered with plaintiff's information located on a server or inside a 
computer physically situated in New York. However, the server here is 
located in Florida, and the alleged acts of the defendants never reached 
beyond the bounds of Florida into New York.

 McCague v. Trilogy Corp., 2007 WL 839921 (E.D. Pa. 
Mar 15, 2007)
 Issue is whether Trilogy's websites, accessible in Pennsylvania,
constitute a continuous or systematic part of Trilogy's general 
business sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over it in 
this district. There are no United States Supreme Court or 
Third Circuit Court of Appeals cases deciding whether an 
internet website can establish general personal jurisdiction 
over a defendant. One district court has determined this by a 
sliding scale: personal jurisdiction is proper if a website is 
"interactive" but not if the website is passive. Molnlycke, 64 
F.Supp. 2d at 451.
 Trilogy’s website neither wholly passive or interactive.
 Trilogy’s website do not specifically target Pennsylvanians

 Hageseth v Superior Court of San Mateo County, ---
Cal.Rptr.3d ----, 2007 WL 1464250, Cal.App. 1 Dist. (May 
21, 2007)
 June 2005, Stanford freshman, John McKay accessed an overseas 
online pharmacy portal, USAnetrx.com, to obtain prescription drugs 
"without the embarrassment of talking to a doctor." Unlike most 
online pharmacies, this site did not require a faxed or mailed 
prescription from a licensed pharmacist. 
 McKay ordered 90 capsules of the Prozac after sending his credit
card and some medical history through an online questionnaire. 
 Order routed through JRB Health Solutions, a Florida company.
 Colorado physician Dr. Christian Hageseth, a JRB subcontractor, 
authorized the prescription, without speaking to McKay. 
 A Mississippi-based pharmacy used by JRB filled the prescription 
and sent the medication to McKay in California. 
 On August 2, 2005, intoxicated on alcohol and with Prozac in his
system, McKay - in an apparent suicide -- died of carbon monoxide 
poisoning

2052 of the Business and Professions Code punishable by one 
year confinement and a $10,000 fine

 Petitioner was at all material times located in Colorado and never

 Hageseth v Superior Court of San Mateo County, ---
Cal.Rptr.3d ----, 2007 WL 1464250, Cal.App. 1 Dist. (May 
21, 2007) 
When the commission of a public offense, commenced without the State, is 
consummated within its boundaries by a defendant, himself outside the State, 
through the intervention of an innocent or guilty agent or any other means 
proceeding directly from said defendant, he is liable to punishment therefor in 
this State in any competent court within the jurisdictional territory of which 
the offense is committed.
A preponderance of the evidence shows that, without having at the time a 
valid California medical license, petitioner prescribed fluoxetine for a person 
he knew to be a California resident knowing that act would cause the 
prescribed medication to be sent to that person at the California address he 
provided. If the necessary facts can be proved at trial beyond a reasonable 
doubt, the People will have satisfactorily shown a violation of Business and 
Professional Code section 2052. It is enough for our purposes that a 
preponderance of the evidence now shows that petitioner intended to produce 
or could reasonably foresee that his act would produce, and he did produce, 
the detrimental effect section 2052 was designed to prevent.
Search- Jurisdiction
 In the Matter of the Search of Yahoo, Inc., 2007 WL 1539971 
(D.Ariz May 21, 2007).
 Court finds that 18 U.S.C. § 2703(a) authorizes a federal district 
court, located in the district where the alleged crime occurred,
to issue search warrants for the production of electronically-
stored evidence located in another district. The warrant must 
be issued in compliance with the procedures described in 
FRCP 41.  FRCP 41(b) however, does not limit the authority of 
a district court to issue out-of-district warrants under § 2703(a) 
because Rule 41(b) is not procedural in nature and, therefore, 
does not apply to § 2703(a). 
 Court concludes that § 2703(a) authorizes an Arizona 
magistrate judge to issue an out-of-district search warrant for 
the contents of communications electronically-stored in 
California when the alleged crime occurred in the District of 
Arizona.

 Website Bankruptcy Software Product
 Held- Engaged in fraud and Unauthorized Practice of Law
 Court found vendor qualified as a bankruptcy petition preparer, first 
time that the Ninth Circuit had determined that a software-provider 
could qualify as such
 Services rendered must go beyond mere clerical preparation or 
impersonal instruction on how to complete the forms 
 Several features of software and how it was presented to users 
constituted the unauthorized practice of law. 
 Vendor – “offering legal expertise” “loopholes in the bankruptcy 
code” "top-notch bankruptcy lawyer" "expert system."
Web Based Software as Counsel
 In re Reynoso, 477 F.3d 1117 (9th Cir. N.D. Cal. Feb. 
27, 2007)
 More than mere clerical services. Software chose where to place the 
user's information, selected which exemptions to claim, and 
provided the legal citations to back everything up. 
 Court concluded this level of personal, although automated, 
guidance amounted to the unauthorized practice of law.
 Ninth Circuit specifically limited its holding to the facts of the case, 
and gave no opinion whether software alone (i.e., without the 
representations made on the web site) or different types of programs 
would constitute an unauthorized legal practice.
 The decision stands for the proposition that an overly expert 
program, coupled with poorly chosen statements, can expose a 
software vendor to claims of practicing law without a license

 Fair Housing Council v Roommates.com, --- F.3d ----, 
2007 WL 1412650 (9th Cir. C.D. Cal. May 15, 2007)
 According to the CDA, no provider of an interactive computer service 
shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information 
provided by another information content provider. 47 U.S.C. § 230(c). 
One of Congress’s goals in adopting this provision was to encourage 
“the unfettered and unregulated development of free speech on the
Internet.” Batzel v. Smith, 333 F.3d 1018, 1027 (9th Cir. 2003)
 Councils do not dispute that Roommate is a provider of an interactive 
computer service. As such, Roommate is immune so long as it merely 
publishes information provided by its members. However, Roommate
is not immune for publishing materials as to which it is an 
“information content provider.” A content provider is “any person or 
entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or 
development of information provided through the Internet.” 47 U.S.C. 
§ 230(f)(3) (emphasis added). If Roommate is responsible, in whole or 
in part, for creating or developing the information, it becomes a 
content provider and is not entitled to CDA immunity.

 In re Forgione, 2006 Conn. Super. LEXIS 81 (January 6, 2006)
 Petitioner family members filed a motion for the return of 
unlawfully seized computer items under U.S. Const. amend. IV 
and XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, §§ 7 and 8, as well as the 
return of their seized internet subscriber information. They 
further moved for a court order suppressing the use of the 
computer items and the subscriber information as evidence in 
any criminal proceedings involving any member of the family
 A university student complained to the school's information 
security officer that someone had interfered with the student's 
university E-mail account. The officer determined the internet 
protocol address from where the student's account was being 
accessed and informed the police of his findings. The police 
then obtained a search warrant to learn from an internet 
service provider to whom that address belonged. Once the 
police were informed that the address belonged to one of the 
family members, they obtained a search warrant for the family 
members' home
Seizures
 In re Forgione, 2006 Conn. Super. LEXIS 81 (January 6, 2006)
 The family members asserted that the searches and seizures 
under the search warrants were improper.
 The court found that, using the totality of the circumstances 
test, there was an abundant basis, without the student's 
statement to the officer about a breakup with a family member, 
within the four corners of either search and seizure warrant 
affidavits, to reasonably indicate to either warrant-issuing 
judge that probable cause existed for issuance of the requested 
orders. Further, the family members did not have an 
expectation of privacy in the subscriber information, as it was 
voluntarily divulged to the internet service provider

 Investigation focused on Michelle, PC in her name, no indication
files password protected; Frank told of investigation and does not

 Cops cannot rely on apparent authority to search using a method to 
intentionally avoid discovery of passwords or encryption protection 
by user.
