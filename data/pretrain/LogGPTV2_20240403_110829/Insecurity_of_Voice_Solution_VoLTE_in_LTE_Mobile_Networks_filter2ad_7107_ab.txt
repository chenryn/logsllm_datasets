### V1: Inadequate Access Control in Phone Software and Hardware

**Access Control on the Control Plane**

The purpose of access control on the control plane is to ensure that it is used exclusively by authentic VoLTE (Voice over LTE) signals. However, our analysis reveals that the device lacks robust access control for the VoLTE control plane. Figure 3 illustrates the current implementation on the mobile device, and we also provide a comparison with the circuit-switched (CS) voice for clarity.

**Figure 3: VoLTE Access Control on the Device Side**

- **Control Plane**: The control plane is responsible for managing signaling traffic.
- **Data Plane**: The data plane handles the actual voice and data traffic.
- **VoLTE Interface**: A network interface dedicated to VoLTE, created within the mobile OS.
- **4G Gateway**: Connects the device to the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) core.
- **IMS Core**: Manages the VoLTE signaling and call setup.
- **CS Call Server**: Manages traditional CS voice calls.

**Access Control Options**

There are two primary methods for implementing access control on a mobile device: hardware-based (e.g., 4G/3G chipsets) and software-based (e.g., operating system and applications).

- **CS Calls**: All signaling for CS calls is handled within the chipset and is not exposed to the OS or applications. This makes it difficult to hijack these signals unless the hardware is compromised or a special debugging mode is enabled.
- **VoLTE Signaling**: The VoLTE signaling is exposed to the mobile OS, where a dedicated VoLTE interface is created. This approach offers several advantages:
  - **Flexibility**: Easy upgrades and rich information for the OS and apps to optimize performance.
  - **Protocol Support**: VoLTE uses Internet protocols (IP and SIP), which are well-supported in the OS (e.g., `android.net.sip.*` library).

**Vulnerabilities in VoLTE Access Control**

Despite the benefits, the VoLTE interface is not adequately protected against unauthorized access. Unprivileged apps can easily obtain information about the VoLTE interface, similar to how they access the mobile data interface. For example, the IP address can be retrieved from `/proc/net/if_inet6`, and the signaling server's IP address can be found in the routing table (`/proc/net/ipv6_route`).

- **Non-Authorized Access**: An adversary can inject non-VoLTE data packets into the VoLTE signaling bearer. Even without root privileges, an attacker can specify the destination as any VoLTE-related server, and the packets will be routed accordingly.
- **Root Privilege Exploitation**: With root privileges, an attacker can add routing rules to direct packets to any destination via the VoLTE interface.

**Empirical Validation**

We confirmed the vulnerability through the following tests:

1. **Interface Identification**: An unprivileged app can identify the VoLTE signaling interface (e.g., `rmnet1`) and the PS data interface (e.g., `rmnet0`). The VoLTE interface appears and disappears when VoLTE is enabled or disabled.
2. **Injection of Non-VoLTE Traffic**: We validated that unprivileged applications can inject non-VoLTE traffic into the signaling bearer via the VoLTE interface. For example, sending a UDP packet with a Hop Limit set to 1 to the VoLTE signaling server results in receiving an ICMP packet from the VoLTE gateway, confirming that the packet was sent through the signaling bearer.

**Causes and Lessons**

- **Software-Level Access Control**: The OS does not employ specific permission controls for the VoLTE interface, treating it like any other network interface.
- **Hardware-Level Trust**: The hardware trusts all traffic coming from the software's VoLTE interface, lacking additional security measures.
- **Integrated Protection Needed**: Both software and hardware need to work together to protect the VoLTE interface, especially when the chipset opens access to the OS.

### V2: Imprudent Routing and Forwarding in the Network

**Network-Side Weaknesses**

The next vulnerability lies in the network's routing and packet forwarding, leading to two significant issues:

1. **Unverified Traffic**: Traffic carried through the VoLTE signaling bearer is not verified at runtime, allowing non-authentic control packets to be forwarded.
2. **Routing Rule Abuse**: Routing rules within mobile networks can be exploited to enable direct Mobile-to-Mobile communication and Mobile-to-Internet data access through the VoLTE signaling bearer.

**Empirical Validation**

- **Mobile-to-Internet Communication**: We observed message exchange between a phone and an external server (e.g., Google DNS) through the VoLTE interface. Both inbound and outbound data transfers were feasible.
- **Mobile-to-Mobile Communication**: We confirmed that VoLTE can be used to directly communicate with another mobile device on the same carrier. Both VoLTE-to-VoLTE and VoLTE-to-Data communication were possible in one operator, while another operator only allowed VoLTE-to-VoLTE communication using UDP.

**Causes and Lessons**

- **Lack of Regulation**: The operator does not properly regulate routing and packet forwarding for the VoLTE signaling bearer.
- **Network Reliance**: The network relies on the phone to forward authentic signaling messages, but this is not guaranteed.
- **Distinct Handling Needed**: VoLTE should be treated differently from CS calls and normal PS data to prevent unauthorized access.

### V3: Abusing No Billing of VoLTE Signaling

**Billing Exemption for VoLTE Control Signals**

VoLTE control signals are typically free of charge, as they are essential for facilitating voice calls. However, this practice can be abused to bypass billing for normal PS data access.

- **Free Signaling Messages**: Any packets sent via the VoLTE signaling bearer are considered free, regardless of their destination.
- **Volume-Based Charging**: Mobile data access is usually charged based on the volume of data transferred.

**Empirical Validation**

- **Free Signaling Messages**: We generated excessive signaling messages through the VoLTE interface and confirmed that they were not charged.
- **Exploitation Potential**: This loophole can be exploited to make "free" data service, as there is no effective mechanism to limit the traffic volume going through the VoLTE signaling bearer.

**Conclusion**

To address these vulnerabilities, both software and hardware need to implement more robust access control mechanisms for the VoLTE interface. Additionally, operators should enforce stricter regulations on routing and packet forwarding, and consider more comprehensive billing practices to prevent abuse.
