When installing on Windows 7 x64 with:
    pip install opencv-python     # py 2.7
or
    pip3 install opencv-python     # py 3.6
in both cases, it installs succesfully but at the end, when doing:
    import cv2
we have this bug:
> ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
As noted on many posts, the reason is that this file is missing:
    MS-WIN-DOWNLEVEL-SHLWAPI-L1-1-0.DLL
Fix: install KB2670838 / Platform Update for Windows 7, less than 15 MB
    Windows6.1-KB2670838-x64.msu
**Todo: Can we put this in the release notes of Open CV 3.4.3 or better:  
Can we do a `try: ... except: ...` and display `Please install Platform Update
for Windows 7 / KB2670838` instead of just a non-explicit `DLL load failed`
message ?**
It would save countless hours for Windows users trying to install OpenCV.
