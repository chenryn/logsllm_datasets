### Issue with OpenCV Installation on Windows 7 x64

When installing OpenCV on Windows 7 x64 using the following commands:

- For Python 2.7:
  ```sh
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- For Python 3.6:
  ```sh
  pip3 install opencv-python
  ```

In both cases, the installation completes successfully. However, when attempting to import the `cv2` module, the following error occurs:

```python
import cv2
```

> ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

This issue is due to the absence of the `MS-WIN-DOWNLEVEL-SHLWAPI-L1-1-0.DLL` file. To resolve this, you need to install the KB2670838/Platform Update for Windows 7, which is less than 15 MB in size. The update can be downloaded from the Microsoft website as `Windows6.1-KB2670838-x64.msu`.

### Suggested Improvements

To enhance the user experience and save time for Windows users, we propose the following improvements:

1. **Update Release Notes**: Include a note in the release notes for OpenCV 3.4.3 (or a later version) that specifies the requirement for the Platform Update for Windows 7 (KB2670838).

2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Implement a `try...except` block in the OpenCV code to catch the `ImportError` and provide a more informative error message. For example:

   ```python
   try:
       import cv2
   except ImportError as e:
       if "DLL load failed" in str(e):
           print("Please install the Platform Update for Windows 7 (KB2670838).")
       else:
           raise e
   ```

By implementing these changes, we can significantly reduce the time and frustration experienced by Windows users trying to install and use OpenCV.
