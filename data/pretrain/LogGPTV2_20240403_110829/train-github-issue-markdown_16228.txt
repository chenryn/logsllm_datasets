The code base seems to use lots of identifiers for private member objects or
functions that start with an underscore, followed by an uppercase letter, such
as `IslandWindow::_ApplyWindowSize`
(/src/cascadia/WindowsTerminal/IslandWindow.h#L99).
The C++ standard however says:
> In addition, some identifiers are reserved for use by C++ implementations
> and shall not be used otherwise; no diagnostic is required. Each identifier
> that contains a double underscore __ or begins with an underscore followed
> by an uppercase letter is reserved to the implementation for any use.
(From https://eel.is/c++draft/lex.name#3.1)
Using such identifiers is technically an invocation of undefined behavior.
