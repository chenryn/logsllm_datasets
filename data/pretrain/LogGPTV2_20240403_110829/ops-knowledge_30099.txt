User: Is Python generally slower on Windows vs. a *nix machine?  Python seems to blaze on my Mac OS X machine whereas it seems to run slower on my Window's Vista machine. The machines are similar in processing power and the vista machine has 1GBs more memory. 
I particularly notice this in Mercurial but I figure this may simply be how Mercurial is packaged on windows.
Assistant: With the OS and network libraries, I can confirm slower performance on Windows, at least for  versions =< 2.6.  
I wrote a CLI podcast-fetcher script which ran great on Ubuntu, but then  wouldn't download anything faster than about 80 kB/s (where ~1.6 MB/s is my usual max) on either XP or 7.
I could partially correct this by tweaking the buffer size for download streams, but there was definitely a major bottleneck on Windows, either over the network or IO, that simply wasn't a problem on Linux.  
Based on this, it seems that system and OS-interfacing tasks are better optimized for *nixes than they are for Windows.
