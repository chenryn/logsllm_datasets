## Introduction
Welcome to the LineCon after-party. We are excited to share our research on CableTap, a project that has uncovered significant vulnerabilities in Internet Service Provider (ISP)-provided wireless gateways and set-top boxes.

## What is CableTap?
CableTap is a comprehensive security analysis of ISP-provided wireless gateways and set-top boxes. Our research has identified:
- **26 CVEs**
- Multiple unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack chains
- Network vulnerabilities
- Wi-Fi vulnerabilities
- ZigBee RF4CE vulnerabilities

## Why Does CableTap Matter?
- **Full compromise of affected devices**
- **Wide impact**:
  - ISP vulnerabilities
  - Vendor vulnerabilities
  - RDK (Reference Design Kit) vulnerabilities (used by many major ISPs)
- Attack chains affecting Comcast XFINITY devices have been patched

## Agenda
1. Background on RDK
2. RDK-based devices
3. Progression of research
4. Vulnerabilities
5. Disclosure process
6. Q&A

## Background on RDK
### Reference Development Kit (RDK)
- **Definition**: A standardized software stack with localization plugins, created to accelerate the deployment of next-gen video products and services by multichannel video providers (MVPDs).
- **Founded in 2012**
- **Standardized software stack for**:
  - Modems
  - Set-top boxes
  - Media devices
- **Website**: [rdkcentral.com](https://rdkcentral.com/)

### Open Source Considerations
- **Open-source, community-driven project** available at: [code.rdkcentral.com](https://code.rdkcentral.com/)
- **Challenges**:
  - Discrepancies between the open-source version and deployed versions.
  - Patches take months to deploy, and no CVEs are filed or disclosed to affected customers.
  - Despite these issues, deploying patches with RDK is still faster than with non-standardized "native" stacks.

## RDK-Based Devices
### Types of RDK Devices
- **RDK-B**: Gateways
- **RDK-V**: Set-top boxes

### RDK-V from a Consumer Standpoint
- **Features**:
  - Watch TV
  - On-screen guide
  - On Demand / Pay per view
  - DVR
  - WebApps (Pandora, Netflix)

### RDK-V from an Engineer Standpoint
- **Plumbing**:
  - DRM, Diagnostics, Management
- **Audio/Video**:
  - PPV, VOD, Closed Captioning (Webkit)
- **Features**:
  - DOCSIS, MoCA, RF4CE
- **Technologies**:
  - Webkit, OpenGL, GStreamer

### RDK-B from a Consumer Standpoint
- **Modem + Router = Gateway**
- **Features**:
  - Modem and router functionality
  - Can connect with home security systems and cordless phones
  - All-in-one internet solution

### RDK-B from an Engineer Standpoint
- **Architecture**:
  - Network Processor + Application Processor
- **Processor**:
  - Intel PUMA

## Progression of Research
### Initial Stages
- **Inspiration**: Peter Geissler’s talk at HITB
- **Collaboration**: Marc connected with Chris, a former Comcast customer, who gave a 32C3 talk on "Beyond your cable modem."
- **Initial Steps**:
  - Learning web application security
  - Pulling off the filesystem using a previously disclosed web UI ping vulnerability
  - Digging into the RDK repositories

### Getting Serious
- **Finding vulnerabilities and getting serious**
- **Involving Bastille**: Bringing the side project to Bastille
- **Adding Logan**: Bringing in hardware and embedded hacking expertise
- **Expanding scope**: Including set-top boxes
- **Disclosing to vendors**: As new vulnerabilities were found

## Vulnerabilities
### Free Internet Access
- **Public Wi-Fi access points** run by ISPs (e.g., "CableWiFi", "xfinitywifi")
- **Customer logs in** to their ISP account to get access
- **MAC address is remembered** for future access
- **Attacker can spoof the MAC** to gain free internet on other public access points

### Hidden Home Security Wi-Fi
- **Home security service** offered by many ISPs
- **Touchscreen control panel** connects over Wi-Fi
- **Hidden Wi-Fi network** runs on the customer’s gateway
- **SSID and passphrase** generated based on the CM MAC
- **Key generation**:
  - CalculatePSKKey in the code
  - Cross-compiling for big-endian ARM and running a keygen binary on the gateway
  - Guesswork yielding the CM MAC input and PSK key output

### DHCP ACK CM MAC Leak
1. Connect to "xfinitywifi" network
2. CM MAC of the wireless gateway is included in the DHCP ACK
3. Generate hidden home security network SSID and passphrase

### IPv6 Multicast CM MAC Leak
1. Sniff the 802.11 channel used by the target wireless gateway
2. Every ~4 seconds, a 156-byte IPv6 multicast packet is transmitted with the l2sd0.500 interface MAC address
3. Translate the l2sd0.500 MAC to the CM MAC
4. Generate hidden home security network SSID and passphrase

### eMTA FQDN CM MAC Leak
1. mta0 (VoIP) interface has FQDN containing the mta0 MAC
2. Translate the mta0 MAC into the CM MAC
3. Generate hidden home security network SSID and passphrase

### Syseventd Usage
- **Bound to all interfaces**
- **Sometimes not firewalled off** from public-facing IP addresses
- **Exposed to LAN IPs**
- **Syseventd services** on TCP 52,367 (IPv4 address space)

### Dual Operating Systems
- **Two operating systems** on the board:
  - One ARM (modem w/ web app) and one Atom (router)
- **Modem at bottom of range** (10.0.0.1) and Atom at top of range (10.0.0.254)

### Custom Routes
- **Atom OS** has an interface allocated in 169.254.0.0/16 range for Dbus
- **Custom RPC service** that is quite literally RCE as a service, and all that FastCGI goodness
- **Hardcoded root SSH creds** to ARM side on 192.168.0.0/16

### Set-Top Box Vulnerabilities
- **Remote web inspector**: Comparable to Firefox and Chrome DevTools, accessible over the internet
- **Arbitrary file read and root command execution**: Sanitize your post data!
- **Voice remote overview**: Control your STB with your voice, wireless instead of IR, motion-activated lights
- **RF4CE overview**: Zigbee protocol for remote control, key exchange is unencrypted
- **RF4CE MSO (OpenCable)**: Uses RF4CE for remote control of cable equipment, binding process is not rate-limited
- **RF4CE remote force pairing**: Emulate remote, entire binding process in under one second, ~2 hours to force pair remote
- **RF4CE remote force OTA**: Firmware package isn’t signed, modify update daemon, firmware payload, fix CRC and version, OTA

## Disclosure
### Disclosure Timeline
- **03/27/2017**: Group 1 Vendor Disclosures
- **03/28/2017**: Group 2 Vendor Disclosures
- **04/20/2017**: Group 3 Vendor Disclosures
- **04/28/2017**: Group 4 Vendor Disclosures
- **07/28/2018**: Public Disclosure (all groups)

### Remediation and Mitigation
- **Unauthenticated RCE attack chains** affecting Comcast XFINITY devices have been remediated
- **Customers of other ISPs** should contact their ISP to determine if their hardware is affected by CableTap

## Final Remarks
- **Not enough time to cover all vulnerabilities**
- **Please see our whitepaper for further details**
- **We found a substantial number of vulnerabilities, but the most severe have been patched (hooray!)**

## Q&A
Thank you for watching our talk!  
Special thanks to Bastille for supporting our research and Comcast for remediating the unauthenticated RCE attack chains affecting Xfinity-branded devices.
