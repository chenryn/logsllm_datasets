This field has been well documented… Thanks to the late Bill Cheek
Either pin 9 or 11 in most cases where you need to tap off of.

Finding the Discriminator IC?
Discriminator Taps:
What is it:
  A physical connection from a pin off the discriminator IC/circuit (the pin
varies depending on the chip), this connection
 allows access to the raw audio so that the rcvd signal can be decoded.
Why is it needed:
 In order to decode digital mods the raw signal is needed, raw meaning
before it has reached the “audio stage” this is known as “baseband audio”.
Finding the chip:
 A large amount of documentation regarding current and pass scanners
exist… (go into more detail)

Not very expensive to either make or buy… both slicers can be bought for
lvl2 ($16) and lvl4 ($24) w/ power adapter, both prices may have changed.
(check ebay)
What exactly the data slicer does… kinda like a modem and it decodes
FSK…
Note:
Lvl 2 is also known as a hamcomm

The ULS DB is grand but its only for the initial search.
Get to know the signals by ear its best when your looking for a solid signal.
The Band Scope will show you activity near the freq you are on.

6K VS 50K: 6k just isn’t wide enough
for most text
Once I have the freq that I will be monitoring I’ll switch the bandwidth from
15k to 50k on NFM.

The idea is gather data to get actionable information or information of
interest.   As with any sort of collection
 there needs to be strong set of ethics lad down first.  This data is in the
clear but none the less it shouldn’t be
abused that’s not the point or is it?

Most if not all use the line out off the radio in this community, therefore
without the base band I’m going no where BUT it should be do able if setup
correctly ( on the pcr 1000 it has a “packet radio” jack which happens to be a
discriminator tap.  The site also offers different sound qualities:
Low quality: 16kbit CBR mono 11.025kHz
Medium quality: 32kbit CBR mono 22.050kHz
High quality: 32-128kbit VBR mono 44.100kHz
