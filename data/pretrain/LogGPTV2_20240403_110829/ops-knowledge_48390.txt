**User:** After installing Python 3.3.0, my terminal still shows Python 2.7.2 as the default version. I'm new to Python and I just want to set up a good development environment on my Mac (OS X 10.8).

**Assistant:**

There are several ways you can resolve this issue:

1. **Modify Your `.bash_profile`**:
   - Open your `.bash_profile` file in a text editor. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     open -e ~/.bash_profile
     ```
   - Add the following line to create an alias for `python` that points to `python3`:
     ```sh
     alias python='python3'
     ```
   - Save the file and close the editor.
   - Reload your `.bash_profile` by running:
     ```sh
     source ~/.bash_profile
     ```

2. **Use `python3` Command Directly**:
   - Instead of using the `python` command, use `python3` whenever you need to run Python 3. For example:
     ```sh
     python3 script.py
     ```

3. **Install Python 3 via Homebrew**:
   - If you haven't already installed Homebrew, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
   - Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Python 3 with:
     ```sh
     brew install python
     ```
   - This will install the latest version of Python 3 and add it to your PATH. You can then use `python3` to run Python 3 scripts.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up a working Python 3 development environment on your Mac.
