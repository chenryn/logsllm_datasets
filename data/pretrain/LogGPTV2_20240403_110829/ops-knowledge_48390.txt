User: Terminal is still showing Python 2.7.2 after an install of 3.3.0
I'm new to python- just want to get a good development environment working on Mac 10.8.
Assistant: You have few options

In your bash ~/.bash_profile add alias python='python3' 
Instead of using python command use python3 instead.
Install python3 via homebrew
