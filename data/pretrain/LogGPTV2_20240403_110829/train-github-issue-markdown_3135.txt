### Apache Airflow version
2.3.1
### What happened
When attempting to delete a DAG using Airflow 2.3.1 I get the following error,
and the DAG along with its metadata are effectively not deleted:
    Something bad has happened.
    Airflow is used by many users, and it is very likely that others had similar problems and you can easily find
    a solution to your problem.
    Consider following these steps:
      * gather the relevant information (detailed logs with errors, reproduction steps, details of your deployment)
      * find similar issues using:
         * [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions)
         * [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues)
         * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/airflow)
         * the usual search engine you use on a daily basis
      * if you run Airflow on a Managed Service, consider opening an issue using the service support channels
      * if you tried and have difficulty with diagnosing and fixing the problem yourself, consider creating a [bug report](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/new/choose).
        Make sure however, to include all relevant details and results of your investigation so far.
