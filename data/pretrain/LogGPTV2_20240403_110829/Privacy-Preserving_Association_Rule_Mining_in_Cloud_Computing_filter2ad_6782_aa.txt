Abstract:  With the appearance of cloud computing and its domains for IT services based on the internet and big data centers, the 
outsourcing of data and computing services is acquiring a huge relevance. The interest in the area of data mining, as a service, has been 
the main stay; because of the encouraged development in the various fields, such as Cloud Computing. A third party service provider, 
the server, comes in the frame, when a company, the data owner, who lacks in expertise or the resources, outsources its mining needs. 
However  the  data owner  thinks  both  the  items  and  the association  rules of the outsourced  Database  as  a  confidential  property.  The 
server stores the data and ships transformed by the data owner. Then the data owner sends mining queries to the server, and the server 
returns  the  extracted  patterns.  From  these  patterns,  the  owner  recovers  the  true  patterns.  Within  corporate  privacy-preserving 
frameworks, the problem of outsourcing the association rule mining responsibilities in the cloud environment is studied in this paper. 
An  innovative  approach  ensures  that  every  transformed  item  from  data  owner  to  server  is  interchangeable  with  compared  to  the 
background knowledge of attackers is proposed in the paper. Our methods are scalable, effectual and protect privacy on an extremely 
huge  and  real  transaction  database  representative  our  complete  algorithm.  This  approach  also  proposes  to  provide  the  privacy-
preserving mining over cloud. We can assume that a conventional model where the adversary knows the area of items and their exact 
occurrence and can employ this information to identify cipher items and cipher item sets. 
Keywords: Association rule mining, Privacy-preserving mining, Database outsourcing, Cloud environment, Extracted patterns. 
1. Introduction 
As the cloud computing and the model of the same emerged 
for the IT services based on the internet and the data centers, 
the  data  and  computing  service’s  outsourcing  is  obtaining 
huge  relevance,  and  these  are  expected  to  attract  the  large 
number of researchers in few years. Services like, business 
intelligences  and 
including, 
advanced analytics based on the data mining, are going to be 
amongst  the  services  acquiescent  to  be  outsourced  on  the 
cloud,  because  of  the  data  intensive  nature,  that  of  the 
complexity of the algorithms for data mining. Therefore, the 
pattern  of  data  mining  and  data  management  will 
presumable to grow as the popularity of the cloud raises [1]. 
This  data  mining-as-a-service  pattern  is  intended  to  enable 
organizations  with  partial  computational  capitals  and  data 
mining expertise to outsource the needs of data mining to a 
third-party  service  provider  [2],  [3].  The  main  security 
drawback is that  the  server can always access the  valuable 
data  from  the  owner  and  can  learn  sensitive  information 
from it. But, the transactions and these mined patterns both 
are and will always be the property of data owner. And these 
must  remain  in  safety  at  server  [4].  Protection  of  sensitive 
information  in  the  situation  of  our  research  includes  two 
essential  goals:  knowledge  protection 
and  privacy 
preservation.  The  earlier  is  related  to  privacy  preserving 
association rule mining, whereas the final refers to privacy-
involving 
preserving  clustering.  An  appealing  feature 
knowledge  protection 
is 
characteristics  that  they  have  common.  For  example,  in 
knowledge  protection,  an  organization  is  the  owner  of  the 
data  so  it  must  protect  the  sensitive  knowledge  discovered 
from such data, while in privacy preservation individuals are 
the owner of their personal information [5]. 
In this paper, we have proposed a method with the goal in 
mind that to develop an encryption scheme that will enable 
formal privacy guarantees and will validate this model with 
large-scale-real-life transaction databases (TDBs). The client 
encrypts  the  data,  based  on  encrypt-decrypt  (E/D)  module 
that  is  essential  to  be  treated  as  a  black  box.  The 
transformation of the input data into the encrypted database 
is done by this module. The data mining and the encryption 
pattern  sending  to  owner  is  conducted  by  the  server.  The 
recovery  of  true  identity  of  the  returned  patterns  and  their 
true supports is done by the E/D module. It is insignificant 
to  explain  that  when  data  are  encrypted  by  using  1–1 
substitution ciphers without making use of fake transactions, 
many ciphers and thus, the transactions and prototypes can 
be  broken  down  by  the  server  by  high  probability  with 
launching the  frequency-based  attack. Therefore,  the  prime 
focus of this paper is to propose a new encryption schemes 
so as to the guarantees of the formal privacy can be proved 
against  the  attacks  carried  out  by  the  server.  The  server 
might  use  the  background  knowledge,  at  the  same  time 
controlling the resource requirements. The research done on 
Privacy-Preserving  Database  Mining  (PPDM)  has  attracted 
lot  of  attention  in  few  years.  The  main  approach  provided 
here is, the private data is collected from multiple owners by 
a  collector,  called  server,  for 
the  prime  purpose  of 
combining  the  data  and  conducting  the  mining  on  these 
combined  data.  The  data  are  subjected  to  an  arbitrary 
perturbation, as the collectors are not trusted with protection 
of the privacy, as it is collected. Many techniques have been 
invented  for  disturbing  the  data  so  that  the  privacy  will  be 
preserved, at the same time ensuring the mined patterns and 
other systematic properties are adequately close to the mined 
patterns from original data. This method works as pioneered 
by [6] and some papers have been following this since [7]. 
But these approaches are insufficient for corporate privacy. 
In  order  for  privacy  preservation,  before  the  records  are 
shared,  the  information  records  can  be  de-identified.  By 
deleting  some  unique  identity  fields,  like  name,  passport 
and  privacy  preservation

number etc, it can be accomplished. But even after deleting 
this  information,  some  other  kinds  of  information  like, 
behavioral  or  personal  information,  is  still  available.  The 
information  may  contain  Dob,  gender,  number,  zip  code, 
postal address, number of accounts. And if this information 
is with any other dataset, it would identify the subjects. To 
avoid  this  disclosure  of  important  information,  a  privacy 
preservation  algorithm  is  essential  in  association  rule 
mining.  There  are  many  different  techniques  have  been 
proposed to tackle this problem. Where, most of the methods 
cause information-loss or some other side effects. The side 
effects  may  include  the  falsely  generated  bogus  rules  or 
mistakenly  hiding  non-sensitive  rules.  So  it  is  essential  to 
sort  out  these  papers  into  classes  in  such  an  approach  to 
distinguish  the  benefits  and  faults  of  diverse  principle 
concealing procedures. 
The important issue that researchers used to concentrate was 
the use PPDM in cloud. This issue is solved in this paper by 
the proposed technique. The main issue to be researched in 
near future is to find a more secure technique for the storage 
of  the  data  on  the  cloud.  As  the  techniques  will  grow,  so 
does  the  different  types  of  attacks  will.  More  research  is 
needed to be done in that area. The remaining paper can be 
sorted out as: Section 2 gives Pattern mining task that is the 
base for this method. Later in the section, we have reviewed 
privacy  model  on  which,  this  method  is  based.  Adversary 
knowledge and attack model is also described there. Finally, 
we  have  quickly  examined 
the  Encryption/Decryption 
scheme.  This  scheme  includes  the  Encryption,  Decryption 
and  the  Grouping  of  the  items.  In  section  3,  is  briefly 
reviewed conclusion.
