To enhance email security and prevent spoofing, implement anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms. These mechanisms should include:

- **Sender Policy Framework (SPF):** This protocol verifies the sender's domain by checking if the sending mail server is authorized to send emails on behalf of that domain.
- **DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM):** DKIM ensures the integrity of the email by verifying a digital signature attached to the message.

By enabling these mechanisms within your organization, you can establish policies such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC). DMARC allows both internal and external recipients to perform similar message filtering and validation, thereby reducing the risk of phishing and other email-based attacks.
