"The truth is also that a well-placed squirrel can wreak almost as much havoc as a cyber 
attack on a power grid."  
“Doctor” Charles Palmer, Director, Institute for Advanced Security, IBM, June 2010 
“We must find this well-placed squirrel, and ensure that it never falls into the hands of our 
enemies.”

If you haven't just emerged from a coma, you probably have some idea of the multifaceted 
attack surface that the inevitable modernization of power transmission and distribution is 
rapidly introducing. 
What you may not be thinking about just yet, though, is the path much of that attack surface 
travels on... The air around you. 
 So where do we start? The "Smart Grid" itself is pretty well understood at this point, 
and I won't bore you by linking to some Wikipedia article or other and describing it.  
At the end of the day it's pretty simple: Utilities have been operating more or less in the dark, 
or at least at a macro-level, for a long time now, with no real idea of load or usage beyond (at 
best) a neighborhood or substantion level. The price paid for that lack of visibility is clear as 
well: brownouts and blackouts caused by unexpected or unforeseen changes in load that, 
while rare, often have a domino effect due to interdependence between utilities. At a less 
intrusive level, utilities struggle with either overbuying or underbuying capacity, with an 
unexpected heat wave or a cold snap enough to put planning off the rails. 
The basics are pretty straightforward - let's connect utility distribution, delivery, and 
transmission, let's automate where we can. Let's monitor load, usage, and demand, and 
adapt our delivery in something closer to real time.  
In reality, the notion that in 2010, utilities are still "rolling trucks" to connect and disconnect 
service and gather usage data is laughably quaint. Imagine an ISP with no QoS, no granular 
view into real-time usage or load, no bandwidth caps, no weight-based routing protocols, no 
metered bandwidth. Your cell phone, cable, satellite television, and broadband providers all 
have near-instant visibility into load, demand, and usage, and have for over a decade.  
Is it really so unreasonable to expect electric, gas, and water utilities to want the same just-
in-time data, the same accuracy? No, it's not.  
Unfortunately, though, it's not quite that simple. Because US utilities are so late to the party, 
and thanks in no small part to some well-intentioned but missapplied stimulus money,

adoption of grid automation is happening at a breakneck pace, and as with any rapid push of 
new technology, Mistakes Are Made.  
And those mistakes have greater potential consequences than, say, the great Central 
Colorado Comcast Outage of July 1, 2010, which, while certainly frustrating to the writer of 
this document due to his inability to stalk nearby strangers on Foursquare, ultimately doesn't 
quite equate to a real disruption of critical infrastructure. 
  If we accept that this stuff is inevitable, and that at least the rationale to interconnect 
all of the grid's naughty bits together makes sense, what's the quickest way to move things 
forward?  
Let's say you've got a few million homes to bring online, a handful of power stations, a few 
thousand substations, maybe a reactor and a geothermal plant or two (kidding, mostly), and 
you've got a few million in stimulus money to do it with, which unfortunately has a shelf life of 
24 months or so. 
Yep, you're probably going wireless. It's quick, it's low-footprint, and all of the vendor 
whitepapers you read seem to say the right words, "FIPS-140, encrypted, secured 
transmission, signing certificates", and whatnot. Sure, there are rumblings of standards 
bodies and requirements definitions, like AMI-Sec and UtiliSec, or even some bazillion-page 
audit spec from the fossils at NERC. But you need to go live now, you don't have time to wait 
for committees and subcommittees to ratify some watered-down list of vagaries.  
And that vendor whitepaper looks fantastic, it really does. It has flow charts and everything.
