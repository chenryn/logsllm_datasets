User: Could someone explain to me how can I run my py2exe program, a console program, without the terminal on Windows?
I'm trying to make a program that re-sizes windows and it supposed to start with windows, so I want it hide out but still running...
Assistant: Not really understand your requirement, but you can try start /MIN. type start /? on the command line to see its help page.
