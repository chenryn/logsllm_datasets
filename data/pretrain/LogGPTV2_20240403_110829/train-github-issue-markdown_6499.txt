## Bug Report
**Current Behavior**  
as of 7.5.0 the output of my distributed code has become more verbose. I'm not
sure if it's a bug or intended side-effect of another change. If it's
intended, I haven't worked out how to reduce the output again.
Basically a single-line babel-helper has been replaced at the top of the file
with multi in-line functions
**Input Code**
    const test = { t: 'test' };
    const { t } = test;
    const foo = (...args) => args;
    const a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
    const b = [...a, 'foo'];
    const c = foo(...a);
    export const es6a = foo;
    export const es6b = { ...test, t, a, b, c };
**output**
    import _defineProperty from "@babel/runtime/helpers/defineProperty";
    function ownKeys(object, enumerableOnly) { var keys = Object.keys(object); if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var symbols = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(object); if (enumerableOnly) symbols = symbols.filter(function (sym) { return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, sym).enumerable; }); keys.push.apply(keys, symbols); } return keys; }
    function _objectSpread(target) { for (var i = 1; i = 61', 'Firefox >= 60', 'Opera >= 48' ],
    },
has there been an update to the spec which these browsers no longer support?  
is there another plugin or way that i can fill this gap rather than adding
this code at the top of the file?
