@alexcrichton has indicated this may be related to using newer versions of
gcc, which might explain why it doesn't fail on the buildbot machines.
The segfault occurs while running the `tailcallelim` llvm pass on
`ast::Pat_::drop()`, possibly during the prerequisite `tti` analysis.
Turning on any kind of debug information for either rust or llvm causes the
problem to disappear.
