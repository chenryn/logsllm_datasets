When creating declaration files (`"declaration": true` in `tsconfig.json`) for
a component which uses `withStyles` the typescript compiler complains with :
> TS4023:Exported variable 'MyComponent' has or is using name
> 'StyledComponentProps' from external module "./node_modules/material-
> ui/index" but cannot be named.
See microsoft/TypeScript#9944 for more context on the issue
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behaviour
Type inference to handle the issue.
## Current Behavior
The compiler issues and error. A work around is to import
`StyledComponentProps`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
    import * as React from 'react';
    import {withStyles} from 'material-ui/styles';
    const decorator = withStyles(({ spacing }) => ({
      root: {
        padding: spacing.unit * 2
      }
    }));
    const Example = decorator(({classes}) => (
    ));
    export default Example;
and set `"declaration": true` in `tsconfig.json`
To work around add `import {StyledComponentProps} from 'material-ui';` to the
top of the file
## Context
I am creating a node package of shared MUI components for internal use and
exporting them (hence using declaration files)
