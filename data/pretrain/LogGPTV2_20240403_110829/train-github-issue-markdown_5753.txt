Hi,  
I use an embedded database (HSQL) in my integration test suite. Its a maven
project with TestNG.
I have one default context configuration (which includes the database) and
several extensions:  
for instance:
    @ContextConfiguration("/spring/default.xml")
    public class PodcastControllerTest extends AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests {...}
    // and
    @ContextConfiguration({ "/spring/components/amq-broker.xml", "/spring/default.xml" })
    public class SophoraAvDocumentTest extends AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests {...}
When executing the tests with maven (maven-surefire), all the tests with the
first configuration reuse the same context (due to context caching). The first
test-setup with the second configuration should create a fresh application
context, but it fails with Database-Errors indicating, that the objects to
create already exist. (I spent quite some time debugging the maven process).
Here is the maven surefire config:
    	org.apache.maven.plugins
    	maven-surefire-plugin
    		1
    		slow,local
    		-Xmx1024m
My theory is, that both contexts connect to the same database instance,
because they are in the same vm and the name of the db-instance is the same:  
EmbeddedDatabaseFactory.databaseName = "testdb";
I did not find a way to assign the name with the jdbc:embedded-database-Tag.
So I created a custom EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder which assigns a random name
(UUID) to every new instance:
    EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder builder = new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder().setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL).setName(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
    for (String sqlResource : this.scripts) {
        builder.addScript(sqlResource);
    }
    this.embeddedDatabase = builder.build();
With this one the errors are gone. Would it be a solution to add a
configuration-option to jdbc:embedded-database for random db-instance names?
