User: Please list and take measures for possible security problems in web applications.
Assistant: 1. SQL injection attack: Use parameterized query to filter user input to ensure that the input data will not be executed as code. 2. Cross-site scripting (XSS): filter user input and implement escaping of input data, convert special characters into safe HTML instances, or use client-side scripting to prevent XSS. 3. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Use security tokens to prevent, add verification codes, disable automatic login, and use anti-attack login verification when logging in. 4. Session hijacking attack: Use HTTPS to enhance the security of data transmission, limit the timeliness of sessionID and prohibit sessionID from being transmitted by URL, and use double authentication to strengthen user authentication. 5. File inclusion vulnerabilities: Use relative paths instead of absolute paths, avoid using dynamic file inclusion functions, and adopt more stringent file access control measures. 6. Leakage of sensitive information: Encrypt sensitive information in databases or file storage, formulate stricter data access policies, and regularly audit system data access rules to ensure that sensitive data will not be leaked. 7. Unauthorized access vulnerabilities: implement access control policies, restrict access to sensitive operations, delete unnecessary accounts and permissions, authenticate logged-in users, and limit the number of sensitive operations and other preventive measures. 8. Denial of service attack (DOS): Realize network traffic filtering, adopt methods such as server resource management strategies, and conduct capacity assessment and bottleneck diagnosis in advance to ensure that the server can work normally and the scalability is strong enough.
