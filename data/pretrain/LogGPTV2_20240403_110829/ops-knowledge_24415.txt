User: I'm working on a simple Python script that can use subprocess and/or os to execute some commands, which is working fine.
However, when the script exits I'd like to cd the actual Terminal (in this case OS X) so on exit, the new files are ready to use in the directory where the have been created. All the following (subprocess.Popen, os.system, os.chdir) can do what I want from within the script (i.e. they execute stuff in the target directory) but on exit leave the Terminal at the script's own directory, not the target directory.
I'd like to avoid writing a shell script to temporary file just to achieve this, if this is at all possible anyway?
Assistant: Have you tried simply running the program in the current shell?
i.e 
$. script.py
instead of
$script.py
