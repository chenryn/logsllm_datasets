### Detection and Synchronization in Wireless Communication

The detection mechanism for a given slot \( j \) is defined as follows:
\[
s(j) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } p(j) \leq \gamma_D, \\
0 & \text{if } p(j) > \gamma_D,
\end{cases}
\]
where \(\gamma_D\) is the detection threshold (set to -50 dBm in our experiments), and \( p(j) \) is the average received power over the \( j \)-th slot. To address the time misalignment problem, we adopt a solution similar to [44]. Instead of averaging the power of all samples in slot \( j \), the receiver (RX) excludes the samples corresponding to an interval \(\Delta_{\text{max}}\) from the beginning and end of each \( j \)-th slot, where the slot boundaries are computed according to the RX’s own clock. This strategy leaves a time interval of \( T - 2\Delta_{\text{max}} \) for estimating the received power, where \( T \) is the slot duration, and \(\Delta_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum time offset between any of the devices.

### Experimental Evaluation of Synchronization

We set up three USRP devices to transmit ON-OFF messages simultaneously, while a fourth USRP acted as the intended RX. The transmitters (TXs) were placed at different locations in the laboratory to ensure both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channels to the RX. Specifically, TX1 was placed behind a bookshelf inside the room, TX2 was placed outside the room to ensure an NLoS channel, and TX3 was placed at a LoS to the RX. The transmit power for an ON slot was set to 20 dBm with a symbol duration of 1 ms. An artificial clock misalignment from \(\Delta = 1 \mu s\) to \(\Delta = 30 \mu s\) was induced between D1, D2, and D3 to emulate the maximum time offset error. The experiment lasted for the transmission of \(10^6\) sequences of 40 bits each.

#### Selection of Detection Threshold

The first experiment was conducted to select the detection threshold \(\gamma_D\). Figure 20(a) shows that the average received power during an ON slot varied from -42 dBm to -38 dBm. The received power during an OFF slot varied from -72 dBm to -55 dBm, indicating the presence of some ambient noise. Based on these results, the detection threshold was set to \(\gamma_D = -50\) dBm.

#### Slot Detection Error Rate

In the second experiment, we used the same setup as in the first experiment to evaluate the slot detection error rate as a function of the synchronization offset. To mitigate the time misalignment, the RX excluded the first 30 μs from the beginning and end of each slot. The results for the ON slot error rate and the OFF slot error rate are shown in Figure 20(b). We observed that ON slots were always correctly detected for any time offset. For the OFF slots, only seven slots out of \(10^6\) were wrongly estimated, indicating that excluding the samples at the beginning and end of each slot effectively addresses the synchronization problem.

### Interference Effect

To make VERSE robust to interference from co-existing wireless systems, we set the detection threshold for ON slots significantly higher than the typical receiver sensitivity. In the experiments, the detection threshold for ON slots was set to -50 dBm, which is orders of magnitude higher than the average noise level (typically at -120 dBm). This approach impacts the security of VERSE because the adversary no longer needs to cancel a transmission to the noise floor; achieving cancellation below the detection threshold is sufficient. To account for this trade-off, the system security, as expressed by Proposition 2 and Corollary 1, incorporates the probability \( p_n \) of successfully flipping a bit during cancellation. This probability parametrizes the success of the adversary in performing cancellation due to the higher-than-noise-floor detection threshold.

### Timing Analysis

The timing overhead of VERSE includes the following components:
1. **Initialization Step**: This can take up to \(\tau\) for powering on all group devices, setting them to pairing mode, which can be set to 120 seconds [45].
2. **Exchanging Public DH Parameters**.
3. **Transmitting the Digest of the Protocol Transcript in MC ON-OFF Mode**.

The initialization step can be the most time-consuming, but the verification phase, which involves ON-OFF keying, dominates the protocol's timing performance. The ON-OFF keying time is constant regardless of the group size. For a hash with length \(\lambda\), a total of \(2(\lambda + r)\) slots of duration \(T\) are necessary to complete the verification phase. Assuming typical values of \(\lambda = 256\), \(r = 256\) (in the worst case), and \(T = 1\) ms [5], the verification phase requires 1.024 seconds to complete, which is acceptable for practical uses and independent of the number of participating devices.

### Conclusions

We addressed the problem of securely bootstrapping a group of devices to a hub when none of the devices share any prior security associations. We proposed VERSE, a new PHY-layer group message integrity verification primitive resistant to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks over the wireless channel. By exploiting the existence of multiple devices that act as verifiers of the protocol transcript for integrity protection, it becomes infeasible for the adversary to simultaneously manipulate the wireless signal at all devices based on geometrical constraints. We presented a Diffie-Hellman (DH)-based device bootstrapping protocol that utilizes VERSE, requiring only in-band communications with minimal human effort during initialization. We formally proved the security of both VERSE and the bootstrapping protocol against active attacks. Using a real-world USRP testbed, we experimentally validated our theoretical results, showing that an increasing number of devices significantly weakens the adversary's ability to successfully manipulate wireless signals. This contrasts with prior state-of-the-art methods, where the attacker's success probability increases with the number of devices.
