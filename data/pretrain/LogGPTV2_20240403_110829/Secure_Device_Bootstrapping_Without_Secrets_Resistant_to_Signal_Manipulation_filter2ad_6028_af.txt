where γD is the detection threshold (set to -50dBm in our
experiments), and p(j) is the average received power over the
jth slot. To resolve the time misalignment problem, a solution
similar to [44] can be adopted. Rather than averaging the power
of all the samples in slot j, an RX eliminates the samples
corresponding to an interval max from the beginning and the
end of each jth slot, where the slot boundaries are computed
according to the RX’s own clock. This strategy leaves a time

interval of T − 2max for estimating the received power, where
T is the slot duration, and, max is the maximum time offset
between any of the devices.
Experimental evaluation of synchronization: We set up three
USRP devices to transmit ON-OFF messages simultaneously,
while a fourth USRP was acting as the intender RX. We placed
the TXs that simultaneously transmitted the random MC ON-
OFF sequence at different locations in the laboratory with both
LoS and NLoS channels to the RX. TX1 was placed behind a
bookshelf inside the room, TX2 was placed outside the room to
ensure an NLoS channel, whereas TX3 was placed at a LoS to
the RX. The transmit power for an ON slot was set to 20dBm
with a symbol duration of 1ms. An artiﬁcial clock misalignment
from  = 1μs to  = 30μs was induced between D1, D2, and
D3 to emulate the maximum time offset error. The experiment
lasted for the transmission of 106 sequences of 40 bits each.
The ﬁrst experiment was performed to select the detection
threshold γD. Figure 20(a) shows that average received power
during an ON slot varied from -42dBm to -38dBm. The
received power during an OFF slot varied from -72dBm to
-55dBm indicating the presence of some ambient noise. The
detection threshold was set to γD = −50dBm.
In the second experiment, we used the same setup with
experiment one and evaluated the slot detection error rate as
a function of the synchronization offset. To cope with the
time misalignment, the RX excluded the ﬁrst 30μs from the
beginning and end of each slot. The results for the ON slot
error rate and the OFF slot error rate are shown in Fig. 20(b).
We observe that ON slots are always correctly detected for any
time offset. For the OFF slots, a very small number (seven
slots out of 106) were wrongly estimated. This indicates that
excluding the samples at the beginning and end of each slot
effectively addresses the synchronization problem.
Interference Effect: To make VERSE robust to interfer-
ence from co-existing wireless systems, we set the detection
threshold for ON slots signiﬁcantly higher than the typical
receiver sensitivity. In the experiments, we selected the detec-
tion threshold for ON slots to be -50dBm, which is orders of
magnitude higher than the average noise level (typically at -
120dBm). The security of VERSE could be impacted because
the adversary no longer has to cancel a transmission to the noise
ﬂoor, but achieving cancellation below the detection threshold
is sufﬁcient. To account for this tradeoff, the system security,
as expressed by Proposition 2 and Corollary 1, incorporate the
probability pn of successfully ﬂipping a bit during cancellation.
This probability parametrizes the success of the adversary in
performing cancellation due to considering a higher than the
noise ﬂoor detection threshold.
Timing Analysis: The timing overhead of VERSE includes
the following components (a) the initialization step, (b) ex-
changing the public DH parameters, and (c) transmitting in
MC ON-OFF mode the digest of the protocol transcript. The
initialization step can be maximum of τ for powering of all
the group devices by the user so they can be set to pairing
mode, which can be set to 120s [45]. From the remaining
two components, the veriﬁcation phase dominates the protocol’s
timing performance, since the ON-OFF mode is signiﬁcantly
slower than nominal transmission speeds. However, the ON-
OFF keying time is constant to the group size. For a hash with
length (cid:8), a total of 2((cid:8) + r) slots of duration T are necessary
to complete the veriﬁcation phase. Assuming typical values of
(cid:8) = 256, r = 256 (in the worst case) and T = 1ms [5],
the veriﬁcation phase requires 1.024s to complete which is
acceptable for all practical uses and it is independent of the
number of participating devices.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
We addressed the problem of securely bootstrapping a group
of devices to a hub when none of the devices share any
prior security associations. We propose VERSE, a new PHY-
layer group message integrity veriﬁcation primitive resistant
to MitM attacks over the wireless channel. We exploit the
existence of multiple devices that act as veriﬁers of the protocol
transcript for integrity protection. When three or more devices
perform an integrity check, it is infeasible for the adversary
to simultaneously manipulate the wireless signal at all devices,
based on geometrical constraints. We presented a DH-based
device bootstrapping protocol that utilized VERSE, which only
requires in-band communications with minimal human effort
during initialization. We formally prove the security of both
VERSE and the bootstrapping protocol against active attacks.
With a real-world USRP testbed, we experimentally validated
our theoretical results by showing that an increasing number
of devices signiﬁcantly weakens the adversary’s ability to
successfully manipulate wireless signals. This is in contrast to
prior state-of-the-art where the attacker’s success probability
increases with the number of devices.
