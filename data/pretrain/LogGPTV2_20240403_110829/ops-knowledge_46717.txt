User: I'm currently using IDLE, its decent, but I'd like to know if there're better lightweight IDEs built especially for Mac â€” free or commercial.
Assistant: There is a commercial one - Textmate.
Most of the good free editors are cross-platform (if you are ok with it, I'd recommend EditRa - but it doesn't work properly under 10.6 yet, because of some bugs in wxPython).
