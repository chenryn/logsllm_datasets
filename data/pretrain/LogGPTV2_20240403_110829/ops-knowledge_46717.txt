**User:** I'm currently using IDLE, which is decent, but I'd like to know if there are better lightweight IDEs specifically designed for Mac—both free and commercial options.

**Assistant:** For a commercial option, TextMate is highly regarded. If you're open to cross-platform solutions, there are several excellent free editors available. One such editor is EditRa, though it’s worth noting that it currently has some compatibility issues with macOS 10.6 due to bugs in wxPython. 

For a more robust and compatible experience, you might also consider the following free and lightweight IDEs for Mac:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A highly customizable and feature-rich editor with a strong community and extensive plugin support.
- **Sublime Text:** A fast and efficient editor with a wide range of plugins and a user-friendly interface.
- **Atom:** Developed by GitHub, Atom is another powerful and extensible editor with a large number of packages and themes.

These alternatives offer a great balance of functionality and performance, making them suitable for a variety of programming tasks on a Mac.
