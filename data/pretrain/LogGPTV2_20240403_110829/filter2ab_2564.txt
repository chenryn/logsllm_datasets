### Title: BlackHat EU-2020: Shield with Hole - New Security Mitigation Enables Chrome Sandbox Escape and User Data Exfiltration

#### Abstract
Enhanced security mitigations typically contribute to more secure software and increased exploit costs. The Chrome browser, known for its robust security, employs various measures such as a multi-process architecture, sandboxing, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to maintain its status as one of the most secure browsers globally.

However, we have discovered that some security mitigations can inadvertently introduce new vulnerabilities. Recently, the network stack in Chrome has been moved out of the main browser process into a separate 'Network service' process. A new mitigation, 'OutOfBlinkCors' (OOR-CORS), has been implemented in this 'Network service'. Our research reveals that enabling 'OutOfBlinkCors' on Chrome for Android can break the Same-Origin Policy, leading to potential security breaches.

Through extensive research, we have developed a full exploit chain leveraging six distinct bugs and features. This chain allows us to escape the Chrome Sandbox and exfiltrate sensitive user data, including personal photos, private documents, and plaintext account credentials (username and password) from Google, Facebook, and other third-party websites. The exploit can be triggered remotely by clicking a link in an SMS, email, or website. Additionally, the same vulnerabilities affect the Android WebView, and we will demonstrate the attack using the 'Wish' app.

#### Research Process
Initially, our exploit chain was effective on version 81 of Chrome for Android. However, a fix introduced in version 83 broke the chain. We then devised an innovative exploit technique, which we call the 'reflection attack', to bypass this fix. This technique leverages a pre-installed app on Pixel devices.

In our presentation, we will provide a detailed analysis of the full exploit chain, including the root causes of the bugs involved. We will also explain how we circumvented the Scoped-Storage enforcement, a mitigation measure introduced in Android 10, and the methods used to escape the Chrome Sandbox. The bug chain has been reported to Google and classified as 'Critical' severity, the highest level in the Chrome Vulnerability Reward Program.

#### Conclusion
While security mitigations are intended to protect against vulnerabilities, they can sometimes introduce new ones if not implemented carefully. Developers should exercise caution when introducing new mitigations to avoid unintended consequences. For security researchers, new mitigations can present valuable opportunities for discovering and addressing potential vulnerabilities.
