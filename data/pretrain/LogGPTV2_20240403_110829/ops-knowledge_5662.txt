Question: "A security audit at your organization has revealed that the server's security logs directory is set to 755 permissions, allowing group and others to read and execute files. A colleague argues that this is acceptable since it allows the IT support staff to easily access logs for troubleshooting. Which of the following is the most valid counterargument to this claim?"
 "A": "Allowing execute permissions on log files is necessary for IT support staff to run diagnostic tools."
 "B": "Setting logs to be world-readable does not pose a security risk since logs do not contain sensitive information."
 "C": "Log files should be strictly confidential and only accessible by authorized personnel to prevent potential leak of sensitive data."
 "D": "Reducing permissions may prevent the web server from writing new entries to the logs, undermining their purpose."
Answer: C
