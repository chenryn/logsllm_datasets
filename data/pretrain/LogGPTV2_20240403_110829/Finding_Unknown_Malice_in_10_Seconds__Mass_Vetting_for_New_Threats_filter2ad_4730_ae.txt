### Malware Distribution and Impact

**Global Spread:**
The identified malware is distributed globally, with over 35,473 instances in North America, 4,852 in Europe, and 87,104 in Asia. In terms of the proportion of malicious code within all applications, Chinese app markets lead with 12.90%, followed by the United States at 8.28%. This suggests a potential lack of stringent regulations and adequate security measures in many Chinese markets compared to those in other countries.

**Google Play Analysis:**
Even in Google Play, a significant 7.61% of downloaded apps are malicious, contrasting with a previous report that found only 0.1% [15]. Most of this malware has been confirmed by VirusTotal, indicating that the proportion of suspicious apps on leading app stores may be higher than previously estimated. Detailed numbers of malicious apps are provided in Appendix (Table 5).

**Scanner Effectiveness:**
We observed that most antivirus scanners respond slowly to new malware. Out of 91,648 malicious apps confirmed by VirusTotal, only 4.1% were detected by at least 25 out of the 54 scanners it hosts (Figure 7). This finding highlights MassVet's capability to identify new malicious content that is often missed by commercial scanners.

### Impact of Malicious Apps

**Installation and Popularity:**
Over 5,000 malicious apps have been installed more than 10,000 times each (Figure 4). Some extremely popular apps have been installed over a million times. The Google Play ratings for these suspicious APKs are generally high, ranging from 3.6 to 4.6 (Figure 5), with an average download count of 100,000 to 250,000 (Figure 6). This suggests that hundreds of millions of mobile devices may already be infected.

### Defense and App Removal

**Google Play's Efforts:**
Google Play actively works to mitigate malware threats. However, our study shows the challenges in this mission. Most of the discovered malware was uploaded in the past 14 months, and newer apps are more likely to be problematic (Figure 8). Apps that have been on the store for a while are less likely to be malicious, with only 4.5% being suspicious. In contrast, 10.69% of newly released apps are flagged as suspicious. These malicious apps can remain on the store for up to 14 months before removal. Notably, three apps uploaded in December 2010 are still present in Google Play.

**App Disappearances:**
Forty days after uploading 3,711 apps to VirusTotal, we found that 250 of them had disappeared from Google Play. Ninety days later, another 129 apps were removed. Among the 379 disappeared apps, 54 (14%) were detected by VirusTotal. This indicates that Google does not rely solely on VirusTotal but closely monitors new malware findings.

**Developer Monitoring:**
We identified 2,265 developers associated with the 3,711 suspicious apps and monitored their activities over 15 weeks (November 2014 to February 2015). During this period, an additional 204 apps from these developers were removed, all detected by MassVet due to shared suspicious methods. Interestingly, these apps were not scanned within VirusTotal, suggesting that Google Play also examines the malicious components and uses them to check other apps by the same developers. However, this process is not comprehensive, as other apps with similar methods remain on the store.

**Reuploading Malware:**
Some developers reuploaded the same or similar malicious apps after they were removed. Among the 2,125 reappeared apps, 604 (28.4%) were confirmed malware, unchanged with the same MD5 and names. Additionally, 829 apps with the same malicious code but different names were published. This indicates that Google may not be paying sufficient attention to known malware.

### Repackaging Malware

**Third-Party Stores:**
Most repackaged malware (92.35%) originates from third-party stores. It is rare to see malware authors repackaging Google Play apps, which is an interesting observation.

This comprehensive analysis underscores the need for more robust and proactive measures to combat the spread of malware in app markets, particularly in regions with less stringent security practices.
