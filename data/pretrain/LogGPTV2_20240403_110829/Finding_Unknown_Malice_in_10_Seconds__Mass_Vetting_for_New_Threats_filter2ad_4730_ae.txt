Landscape.
The malware we found are distributed
across the world: over 35,473 from North America,
4,852 from Europe and 87,104 from Asia. In terms of
the portion of malicious code within all apps, Chinese
app markets take the lead with 12.90%, which is fol-
lowed by US, with 8.28%. This observation points to
a possible lack of regulations and proper security protec-
tion in many Chinese markets, compared with those in
other countries. Even among the apps downloaded from
Google Play, over 7.61% are malicious, which is differ-
ent from a prior report of only 0.1% malware discovered
there [15]. Note that most of the malware here has been
conﬁrmed by VirusTotal. This indicates that indeed the
portion of the apps with suspicious activities on leading
app stores could be higher than previously thought. De-

tailed numbers of malicious apps are shown in Appendix
(Table 5).
We observed that most scanners react slowly to the
emergence of new malware. For all 91,648 malicious
apps conﬁrmed by VirusTotal, only 4.1% were alarmed
by at least 25 out of 54 scanners it hosts. The results are
present in Figure 7. This ﬁnding also demonstrates the
capability of MassVet to capture new malicious content
missed by most commercial scanners.

The impacts of those malicious apps are signiﬁcant.
Over 5,000 such apps have already been installed over
10,000 times each (Figure 4). Also, there are a few
extremely popular ones, with the install count reaching
1 million or even more. Also, the Google-Play ratings
of the suspicious APKs are high (most of them ranging
from 3.6 to 4.6, Figure 5), with each being downloaded
for many times (100,000 to 250,000) on average (Fig-
ure 6). This suggests that hundreds of millions of mobile
devices might have already been infected.
Existing defense and disappeared apps. Apparently,
Google Play indeed makes effort to mitigate the malware
threat. However, our measurement study also shows the
challenge of this mission. As Figure 8 illustrates, most
malware we discovered were uploaded in the past 14
months. Also the more recently an app shows up, the
more likely it is problematic. This indicates that Google
Play continuously inspects the apps it hosts to remove
the suspicious ones. For the apps that have already been
there for a while, the chance is that they are quite legiti-
mate, with only 4.5% found to be malicious. On the other
hand, the newly released apps are much less trustworthy,
with 10.69% of them being suspicious. Also, these mali-
cious apps have a pretty long shelf time, as Google needs
up to 14 months to remove most of them. Among the
malware we discovered, 3 apps uploaded in Dec. 2010
are still there in Google Play.
Interestingly, 40 days after uploading 3,711 apps
(those we asked VirusTotal to run new scan upon, as
mentioned earlier) to VirusTotal, we found that 250 of
them disappeared from Google Play. 90 days later, an-
other 129 apps disappeared. Among the 379 disappeared
apps, 54 apps (14%) were detected by VirusTotal. Ap-
parently, Google does not run VirusTotal for its vetting
but pays close attention to the new malware it ﬁnds.
We further identiﬁed 2,265 developers of the 3,711
suspicious apps, using the apps’ meta data, and moni-
tored all their apps in the follow-up 15 weeks (November
2014 to February 2015). Within this period, we observed
that additional 204 apps under these developers disap-
peared, all of which were detected by MassVet, due to
the suspicious methods they shared with the malware we
caught before that period. The interesting part is that we
did not scan these apps within VirusTotal, which indi-
cates that it is likely that Google Play also looked into
their malicious components and utilized them to check
all other apps under the same developers. However, ap-
parently, Google did not do this across the whole market-
place, because we found that other apps carrying those
methods were still there on Google Play. If these apps
were missed due to the cost for scanning all the apps on
the Play Store, MassVet might actually be useful here:
our prototype is able to compare a method across all 1.2
million apps within 0.1 second.
Another interesting ﬁnding is that we saw that some of
these developers uploaded the same or similar malicious
apps again after they were removed. Actually, among the
2,125 reappeared apps, 604 conﬁrmed malware (28.4%)
showed up in the Play Store unchanged, with the same
MD5 and same names. Further, those developers also
published 829 apps with the same malicious code (as that
of the malware) but under different names. The fact that
the apps with known malicious payloads still got slipped
in suggests that Google might not pay adequate attention
to even known malware.
Repackaging malware
and malicious payload.
Among the small set of repackaging malware captured
by the differential analysis, most are from third-party
stores (92.35%).
Interestingly, rarely did we observe
that malware authors repackaged Google Play apps
