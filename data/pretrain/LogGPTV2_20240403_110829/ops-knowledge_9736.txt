Question: A security analyst is reviewing the configuration of a web server. The analyst observes that the server uses TLS 1.2 with a digital certificate that has a 2048-bit key strength and a SHA-256 signature algorithm. The certificate is signed by a trusted CA, has a valid SAN matching the hostname, and is within the validity period. However, the analyst notes that the server supports SSLv3. Which of the following actions should the analyst recommend to improve the server's security?
"A": "Upgrade the digital certificate to a 4096-bit key strength.",
"B": "Disable support for SSLv3 to prevent protocol downgrade attacks.",
"C": "Replace the SHA-256 signature algorithm with MD5 for better compatibility.",
"D": "Increase the validity period of the certificate to reduce renewal frequency."
Answer: B
