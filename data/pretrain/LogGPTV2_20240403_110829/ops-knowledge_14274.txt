User: I want to turn myProgram.py into an executable program. When i run:
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed myProgram.py I have this error:
OSError: Python library not found: .Python, libpython3.5.dylib, Python
This would mean your Python installation doesn't come with proper library files.
This usually happens by missing development package, or unsuitable build parameters of Python installation.
How can I fix the problem?
Assistant: Try copletely uninstalling Python and then re-installing it. Programming can be crazy complicated,  but sometimes it's as simple as that.
