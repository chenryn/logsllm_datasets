The provided system log consists of 20 lines, each containing a timestamp, log level, process ID, relevant software component, and the log content. The log entries span from 18:07:12 to 18:07:17 on October 18th. Here is a step-by-step summary of the log:

1. **Initial Connection Attempt (18:07:12)**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds.
   - An error occurs while contacting the Resource Manager (RM).
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process detects an address change for the HDFS server from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - The `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` for 134 seconds and will retry shortly.

2. **Subsequent Connection Attempts (18:07:13 to 18:07:17)**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` continues to attempt to connect to `msra-sa-41:8030` with the same retry policy.
   - Each attempt results in an error when contacting the RM.
   - The `LeaseRenewer` repeatedly detects the same address change for the HDFS server.
   - The `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` for increasing durations (135, 136, 137, and 138 seconds) and will retry shortly.

**Summary:**
- The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is unable to establish a connection to the server `msra-sa-41:8030` and is retrying according to the specified retry policy.
- The `LeaseRenewer` process is experiencing repeated failures in renewing the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` and is also detecting an address change for the HDFS server.
- The issues persist over a period of 5 seconds, with the `LeaseRenewer` failing to renew the lease for progressively longer durations.
