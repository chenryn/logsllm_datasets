User: I have a Hadoop cluster and different processes are able submit mapreduce jobs to this cluster (they all use the same user account).
Is there a way to distinguish these jobs?  Some kind of description, which can be added to job during submit like 'This is a job of process "1234", do not touch'?
I am using Python and HadoopStreaming,  and would like to distinguish jobs using simple hadoop job -list (or at least using web management interface).
Assistant: Yes, you can specify a name for each job using job.setJobName(String).
If you were to set the job name to something distinguishing you should be able to tell them apart.
For example, by using something likeManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName() you can get the process id and machine name (on linux anyway, unsure of behaviour on other operating systems) in the format of 1234@localhost, where 1234 is the process id, which you could set to the job name to tell them apart.
