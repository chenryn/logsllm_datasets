User: Is it or will it be possible to add more Python libraries than pandas, numpy and numexpr to Azure Data Lake Analytics? Specifically, we need to use xarray, matplotlib, Basemap, pyresample and SciPy when processing NetCDF files using U-SQL.
Assistant: Assuming the libs work with the deployed Python runtime, try to upload the libraries into a location in ADLS and then use DEPLOY RESOURCE "path to lib"; in your script. I haven't tried it, but it should work.
