indicate whether the feed is a snapshot feed or an event feed,
respectively (see Section 2.2). All data was collected during
our measurement period, December 1st, 2017 to July 20th,
2018. Note that a few feeds, like Paid IP Reputation, appear in
multiple categories. In these feeds, indicators are associated
with different categories via attached metadata. We split these
feeds into multiple virtual feeds each containing indicators
belonging to the same category.
3.2 Volume
Volume is one of the oldest and simplest TI metrics repre-
senting how informative each data source is. Table 1 shows
the total number of unique IP addresses collected from each
feed during the measurement period, under column Volume.
Feeds are listed in order of decreasing volume, grouped by
category. The numbers we show are after the removal of in-
valid entries identiﬁed by the sources themselves. Column
Avg. Rate shows the average number of new IPs we received
per day, and Avg. Size lists the average daily working set size
of each feed, that is, the average size of the snapshot.
! Finding: Feeds vary dramatically in volume. Within every
category, big feeds can contain orders of magnitude more data
than small feeds. For example, in the scan category, we saw
over 361,004 unique IP addresses in DShield IPs but only
1,572 unique addresses in PA Analyst in the same time period.
Clearly, volume is a major differentiator for feeds.
Average daily rate represents the amount of new indicators
collected from a feed each day. Some feeds may have large
volume but low daily rates, like Feodo IP Blacklist in the mal-
ware category. This means most indicators we get from that
feed are old data present in the feed before our measurement
started. On the other hand, the average rate of a feed could be
greater than the volume would suggest, like Nothink SSH in
the brute-force category. This is due to the fact that indicators
can be added and removed multiple times in a feed. In general,
IP indicators tend to be added in a feed only once: 37 among
47 IP feeds have over 80% of their indicators appearing only
once, and 30 of them have this rate over 90%. One reason
is that some snapshot feeds maintain a valid period for each
indicator, as we found in all PA feeds where the expiration
date of each indicator is explicitly recorded. When the same
indicator is discovered again by a feed before its expiration
time, the feed will just extend its expiration date, so this oc-
currence will not be captured if we simply subtract the old
data from the newly collected data to derive what is added on
a day. For event feeds and snapshot feeds in PA where we can
precisely track every occurrence of each indicator, we further
examed data occurrence frequency and still found that the vast
majority of IPs in feeds only occurred once—an observation
that relates to the dynamics of cyber threats themselves.
Nothink SSH, as we mentioned above, is a notable ex-
ception. It has over 64% of its indicators appearing 7 times
in our data set. After investigating, we found that this feed
posts all its previous data at the end of every month, behavior
very likely due to the feed provider instead of the underlying
threats.
The working set size deﬁnes the daily average amount of
indicators users need to store in their system to use a feed
(the storage cost of using a feed). The average working set
size is largely decided by the valid period length of the indica-

tors, controlled either by the feed (snapshot feeds) or the user
(event feeds). The longer the valid period is, the larger the
working set will be. Different snapshoot feeds have different
choices for this valid period: PA AlienVault IPs in the scan
category sets a 90-day valid period for every indicator added
to the feed, while PA Abuse.ch Ransomware uses a 30-day
period. Although we do not know the data expiration mecha-
nism used by snapshot feeds other than PA feeds, as there is
no related information recorded, we can still roughly estimate
this by checking the durations of their indicators—the time
rates in two categories are greater than 5%. The scan category
has 29 out of 72 pairs (excluding self comparisons) with an
intersection rate larger than 10%, and the same case occurred
in 19 out of 72 pairs in the brute-force category.
On the other side, feeds in the botnet, exploit, malware and
spam category do not share much data between each other:
all 4 categories have more than three-quarters of pairwise
intersection rates less than 1%. A few big feeds in these cate-
gories can share a signiﬁcant amount of data with some small
feeds in the same category—a characteristic that appears as
a dark vertical line within its category in Figure 1. Paid IP
Reputation in the malware category, for example, shares over
30% of 6 other malware feeds. But the intersections among
the vast majority of feeds in these 4 categories are low. This
ﬁnding is consistent with prior work [26, 42], but we provide
a more comprehensive view regarding different categories.
Figure 1 also shows the relation between feeds across dif-
ferent categories. We can clearly see a relation between scan
and brute-force feeds: multiple scan feeds have non-trivial
intersection with feeds in the brute-force category. In fact,
23.1% of all 760,263 brute-force IPs we collected are also
included by scan feeds in our dataset. There are also three
botnet feeds—PA CI Army, PA VoIP Blacklist and PA Com-
promised IPs—that have over 10% of its data shared with
multiple feeds in the scan category.
3.4 Exclusive Contribution
Exclusive contribution represents the number of indicators
in a feed that are in no other feeds. We calculate each feed’s
exclusive contribution among all the feeds in the same cat-
egory, emphasizing their uniqueness regarding the scope of
data they claim to report. Each feed’s exclusive contribution
is presented in Table 1 in column Exclusive, calculated based
on its volume.
! Finding: As we already observed in Section 3.3, botnet,
exploit and spam feeds have relatively low pairwise inter-
sections. Consequently, the feeds in these four categories
have high exclusive contribution rates in general: the me-
dian exclusive contribution rates of these four categories are
90.9%, 97.5% and 90.5%, respectively. The malware cate-
gory has a low median exclusive rate, since multiple small
feeds have non-trivial intersection with the largest feed Paid
IP Reputation, but the two largest feeds in malware both have
a exclusive rate over 99%. Scan and brute-force feeds have
more intersection within its category, and their exclusive rates
are lower: 62.0% median rate in scan and 62.7% in brute-
force, and the top two largest feeds in both categories have an
exclusive rate below 85%.
If we assume a process where a feed is more likely to have
popular elements, then smaller feeds would be subsumed by
larger feeds. Yet, for some small feeds like Malc0de IP Black-
list in the malware and PA Project Honeypot in the botnet
categories, even though they are several orders of magnitude
smaller than the largest feeds in their categories, a signiﬁcant

feed, shown in the same order as Table 1. Darker (more saturated) colors
indicate greater intersection.
between an indicator being added and being removed. Four
Paid IP Reputation feeds have more than 85% of durations
shorter than 10 days, while the one in the malware category
has more than 40% that span longer than 20 days. Feodo
IP Blacklist has over 99% of its indicators valid for our en-
tire measurement period, while over 70% of durations in the
Zeus IP Blacklist are less than 6 days. We did not observe a
clear pattern regarding how each snapshot feed handles the
expiration of indicators.
3.3 Differential Contribution and Intersection
The differential contribution metric measures the number of
indicators in one feed that are not in another. Equivalently,
we can consider the intersection of two feeds, which is the
number of elements in one feed that are present in the other,
normalized by the size of the ﬁrst: |A∩B|/|A|. Figure 1 shows
the intersection relationship of all feeds in the study. Each cell
in the matrix represents the number of elements in both feeds,
normalized by the size of the feed spanning the rows on the
table. That is, A, in the expression above, ranges over rows,
and B over columns of the matrix. Darker (more saturated)
colors indicate greater intersection. Comparisons of feeds
within a category are shaded red and comparisons of feeds
between different categories are shaded blue. Note that the
