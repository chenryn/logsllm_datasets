### A Systematic Mapping Study in AIOps

In the field of AIOps, we conducted a systematic mapping study using pre-established formulation, search, selection, and categorization techniques. This approach enabled us to collect over 1,000 contributions, which we then grouped into several categories based on our proposed taxonomy. These categories differ significantly in terms of their goals, data sources, and target components.

In our results section, we observed that the majority of papers address failures in various forms. Over time, there has been a growing research interest, particularly in tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis.

### An Influence-Based Approach for Root Cause Alarm Discovery in Telecom Networks

#### Abstract
Alarm root cause analysis is a critical component in the daily maintenance of telecommunication networks, essential for efficient and accurate fault localization and failure recovery. In practice, achieving accurate and self-adjustable alarm root cause analysis is challenging due to network complexity and the vast number of alarms. A popular approach for failure root cause identification is to construct a graph with approximate edges, typically based on event co-occurrences or conditional independence tests. However, this often requires considerable expert knowledge for edge pruning.

We propose a novel data-driven framework for root cause alarm localization, combining causal inference and network embedding techniques. Our framework includes a hybrid causal graph learning method (HPCI) that combines Hawkes Process with Conditional Independence tests, and a Causal Propagation-Based Embedding algorithm (CPBE) to infer edge weights. We then discover root cause alarms in real-time data streams by applying an influence maximization algorithm on the weighted graph. Our method is evaluated on both artificial and real-world telecom data, showing significant improvements over existing baselines.

#### 1. Introduction
Recent years have seen rapid development in cellular networks, with increasing network scale and complexity coupled with higher performance demands. This growth has made network management more challenging and limited the applicability of traditional analysis methods. In cellular networks, anomalies are commonly identified through alarms. A large-scale network can generate millions of alarms in a single day. Due to the interrelated network structure, a single fault can trigger a flood of alarms from multiple devices. Traditionally, to recover after a failure, an operator must analyze all relevant alarms and network information, which can be slow and time-consuming. However, not all alarms are relevant; a subset, known as root cause alarms, are the most significant for fault localization.

There is extensive prior research in Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and fault localization, but most methods are highly specialized and rely on specific properties of the deployed network, either through integrated domain knowledge or particular design decisions. A more general approach is to infer everything from the data itself.

In our proposed alarm RCA system, we create an influence graph to model alarm relations. Causal inference is used to infer an initial causal graph, and we apply a novel Causal Propagation-Based Embedding (CPBE) algorithm to supplement the graph with meaningful edge weights. To identify root cause alarms, we draw on ideas from social network influence propagation and frame the problem as an influence maximization problem. When a failure occurs, our system can automatically perform RCA based on the sub-graph containing the involved alarms and output the top-K most probable root cause alarms.

#### Summary of Contributions
- We design a novel unsupervised approach for root cause alarm localization that integrates causal inference and influence maximization analysis.
- Our framework is robust to causal analysis uncertainty and does not require labeled data.

This approach aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of fault localization in complex and large-scale telecommunication networks.
