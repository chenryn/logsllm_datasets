User: Please list at least three tools that can be used to monitor system resources and describe their characteristics.
Assistant: 1. top: A common command-line tool for real-time monitoring of running processes and system resource usage in the system. It can display CPU usage, memory usage, process information, etc., and can be sorted by different indicators. 2. vmstat: A tool that can monitor system performance in real time. It can help users understand system bottlenecks and performance problems to a certain extent. vmstat can provide real-time reports on running status, including information on memory usage, CPU usage, disk I/O, and system processes. 3. nmon: A highly visual system performance analysis tool, which is mainly used to monitor operating systems such as Linux and AIX. nmon can provide very detailed real-time performance reports, including CPU usage, network bandwidth, memory usage, disk I/O, etc., and it has a variety of views to display these data. At the same time, nmon also supports historical records, which can generate logs for subsequent analysis.
