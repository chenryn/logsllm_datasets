I have a use case where I only want to have a legend for the style (but not
the hue).  
Currently, the relational plotters `lineplot`, `scatterplot`, etc. only allow
to switch on and off the entire legend.  
What I would like to have is a possibility to control the display of the
groups (style, hue, size) individually.
In my case, I would like to use something like `sns.lineplot(...,
legend="style")`.  
The parameter could also be a list to only show two groups: `sns.lineplot(...,
legend=["style", "hue"])`.  
`"brief"` could used like this: `sns.lineplot(..., legend=["style",
"hue_brief"])`.  
The old usage should also stay possible: `sns.lineplot(..., legend="brief")`.
What do you think? Would this be something that the community could find
valuable?
