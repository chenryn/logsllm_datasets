I have a specific use case where I need to display a legend for the style (but not for the hue). Currently, relational plotting functions such as `lineplot` and `scatterplot` in seaborn only allow toggling the entire legend on or off. 

What I would like to see is the ability to control the display of individual groups (style, hue, size) within the legend. For example, I would like to be able to use something like `sns.lineplot(..., legend="style")` to show only the style legend. The parameter could also accept a list to show multiple groups, such as `sns.lineplot(..., legend=["style", "hue"])`.

Additionally, the `"brief"` option could be used in combination with group-specific legends, like `sns.lineplot(..., legend=["style", "hue_brief"])`. The existing usage, such as `sns.lineplot(..., legend="brief")`, should still be supported.
