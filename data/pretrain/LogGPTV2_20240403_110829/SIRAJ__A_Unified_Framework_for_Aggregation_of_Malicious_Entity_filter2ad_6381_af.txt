Weak supervision [24] based approaches learn a speciﬁc type
of generative model based on scanner overlaps and conﬂicts. In
contrast, we learn a more expressive dependency model [26].
IX. CONCLUSION
We propose SIRAJ, a uniﬁed framework that can aggregate
the scan reports of diverse domains such as malware ﬁles,
phishing URLs, malware URLs, and malicious IPs. We adapt
recent innovations in generative modeling and self-supervised
learning to ensure that it can work well even when labeled data
is scarce or non-existent. Another signiﬁcant contribution is
the design of three pretext tasks that are carefully constructed
to learn scanner dependencies and their temporal dynamics.
Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach works
well across multiple domains and can be ﬁne-tuned for various
downstream tasks and robust to both random and adversarial
corruption. SIRAJ can be used both to generate high quality
ground truth for supervised approaches that detect/predict
attack vectors, and to compile high-quality blacklists of attack
vectors early in their life cycle to minimize the damage caused.
It is our belief that our work will trigger more research in
generative modeling, pretext task design, and the development
of uniﬁed frameworks that can work for multiple domains
instead of being siloed into individual domains.
