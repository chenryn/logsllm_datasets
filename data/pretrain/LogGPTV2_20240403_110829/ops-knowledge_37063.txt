User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题deny local logon for a new user through command line windows server 2008 I am creating a local user account that I want to be able to connect over ftp, but not log on to the server, I believe the way to do this is to deny local logon but am unsure how to achieve this via the command line.  This needs to run from an installer on windows server 2008 hence the command line requirement.

I believe it involves somehow applying SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight to the user but the only way I can find to do this is using ntrights.exe which is not shipped with ws2008.

Is it possible to do this via the command line?

Assistant: TheCleaner is correct, no registry value for these User Rights Assignments.

Use the NTRights.exe from the command line.

NTRights.exe -u username +r SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight
