User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SSH server: What's more secure, pub key auth or Google Authenticator time-based auth? I'm curious which would be more secure, pub key authentication or 2-factor auth via Google Authenticator. Apparently I can't use both. If I have pub key authentication, the Google Auth PAM module doesn't ask me for a verification code. But if someone tries to log in with a regular password, it does. So it seems it's either-or.

Assistant: It depends, what are you more concerned about?  Someone being able to steal your private key, or someone stealing your TOTP seeds?  That'll determine which is more likely to be compromised.

Alternatively, if your version of SSHD is new enough, you can use the AuthenticationMethods option in sshd_config to require both, with something like publickey,keyboard-interactive:pam.  This will require both a functional pubkey and the full PAM stack.

An attacker who passively observes traffic should not be able to learn anything about TOTP traffic, as its encapsulated in the SSH connection, and the SSH public key is computationally infeasible to factor for modern key lengths (ECDSA, or RSA >= 2048).
