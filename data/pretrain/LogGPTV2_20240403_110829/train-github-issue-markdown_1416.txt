### Kubernetes Version

### Helm Chart configuration
no configuration
### Docker Image customisations
no customization
### What happened
if we install airflow against argoCD, argoCD synchronizes all, then webserver
and scheduler tries to run, inits with the wait-for-migrations but the job
from migrate-database-job.yaml will never run because is not yet "installed"
from the point of view of argoCD synchronization.
### What you expected to happen
To run the job from migrate-database-job.yaml without need of post-install in
first "installation"
### How to reproduce
Install chart using argoCD (per example version v1.8.7+eb3d1fb)
### Anything else
We can fix it setting replicas to 0 to scheduler and webserver (minimum), then
we let to continue to post-install and then change again the replicas to
scheduler and webserver
