### Rate Limiting for Local Preferential and Random Propagation Worms

Rate limiting (RL) is an effective strategy to mitigate the spread of local preferential and random propagation worms. This section evaluates the effectiveness of rate limiting at end hosts and backbone routers.

**Simulation Results:**
- **Local Preferential Worms:**
  - Rate limiting at end hosts (5% and 30% deployment) shows minimal impact on the propagation of local preferential worms.
  - Edge router-based rate limiting is more effective, yielding a 50% slowdown in worm propagation.
  - Figure 6 illustrates the simulated propagation of local preferential worms with different rate limiting strategies. The results confirm that backbone router-based rate limiting is substantially more effective than end host-based rate limiting.

- **Random Propagation Worms:**
  - Edge router-based rate limiting is highly effective in suppressing random propagation worms.
  - These findings align with our analytical model described in Section 5.2.

### The Effect of Dynamic Immunization

In this section, we examine the impact of dynamic immunization on the spread of worms, considering both analytical models and simulations.

**Analytical Model:**
- We assume that the immunization process starts at time \( d \) after a certain percentage of hosts are infected.
- In each time interval, each susceptible host is patched with probability \( \mu \).
- The dynamics of worm propagation in the presence of immunization can be modeled by the following differential equations:
  \[
  \frac{dI}{dt} = I\beta \left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right), \quad \text{when } t \leq d
  \]
  \[
  \frac{dI}{dt} = I\beta \left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right) - I\mu, \quad \text{when } t > d
  \]
  \[
  \frac{dN}{dt} = -\mu N, \quad \text{when } t > d
  \]
  Solving these equations, we get:
  \[
  \frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{e^{\beta t}}{c + e^{\beta t}}, \quad \text{when } t \leq d
  \]
  \[
  \frac{I}{N_0} = \frac{e^{(\beta - \mu)(t - d)}}{c_0 + e^{\beta(t - d)}}, \quad \text{when } t > d
  \]
  where \( N_0 \) denotes the initial number of susceptible hosts.

**Simulations:**
- Simulations were conducted on a synthetic 1000-node power-law graph with \( d = 20\%, 50\%, \) and \( 80\% \) infection, using \( \beta = 0.8 \) and \( \mu = 0.1 \).
- Figure 7(a) shows the plot of the analytical model, and Figure 8(a) presents the simulation results.
- The earlier the immunization takes place, the more effective it is. For example, starting immunization at 20% infection resulted in a total infected population of 80% of the nodes, compared to 90% when starting at 50% and 98% at 80%.

**Assumptions and Realism:**
- The assumption of a constant probability of immunization (\( \mu \)) is not entirely realistic. In practice, the probability of immunization may increase as the worm spreads and the vulnerability becomes widely publicized, and decrease as the infection becomes rarer.
- We believe the rate of immunization follows a bell curve, but the exact shape is difficult to determine due to lack of data. Therefore, we use the simple assumption of a constant immunization rate.

### Rate Control with Dynamic Immunization

This section examines the combined effect of delayed immunization and rate limiting, focusing on rate limiting at backbone routers, which is the most effective strategy.

**Analytical Model:**
- The growth of infection with delayed immunization and rate control at the backbone routers is given by:
  \[
  \frac{dI}{dt} = I\beta(1 - \alpha)\left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right) + \delta \left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right), \quad \text{when } t \leq d
  \]
  \[
  \frac{dI}{dt} = I\beta(1 - \alpha)\left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right) + \delta \left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right) - \mu I, \quad \text{when } t > d
  \]
  \[
  \frac{dN}{dt} = -\mu N, \quad \text{when } t > d
  \]
  where \( \beta \) is the contact rate of one infected host, \( \delta = \min(I\beta\alpha, rN/2^{32}) \), \( r \) is the average overall allowable rate of the routers with rate limiting control, and \( \alpha \) is the percentage of paths that have rate-limited links.
  - When \( r \) is relatively small, the solution can be approximated as:
    \[
    \frac{I}{N_0} = \frac{e^{\gamma t}}{c + e^{\gamma t}}, \quad \text{when } t \leq d
    \]
    \[
    \frac{I}{N_0} = \frac{e^{(\gamma - \mu)(t - d)}}{c_0 + e^{\gamma(t - d)}}, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \beta(1 - \alpha)
    \]

**Simulations:**
- Simulations were conducted on a synthetic 1000-node power-law graph with \( \beta = 0.8 \) and \( \mu = 0.1 \).
- The timeticks chosen in both analytical and simulation models correspond to the timeticks at which immunization started in the analytical model without rate limiting.
- Figures 7(b) and 8(b) show the analytical model and simulation results of delayed immunization with rate limiting.
- The plots demonstrate how the combination of immunization delays and rate limiting at the backbone affects the infection propagation. For example, immunization at 20% with no rate limiting results in a total infected population of 80%, while the same experiment with rate limiting shows a significant reduction in the infected population.

These results highlight the importance of timely immunization and the strategic placement of rate limiting mechanisms to effectively control the spread of worms.
