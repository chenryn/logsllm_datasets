Hello,
I have a generic component, e.g. `class Select extends
React.Component, any>`. Is there any "right" way to use it from
JSX?
It is impossible to write something like ` />` in JSX. The best
thing that I've found is to write
    let StringSelect: React.Component, any> = Select;
And use `StringSelect` instead of `Select`. Is there anything better?
