* If same LSA updated after current wait but before max, flooding done at start, but next wait twice hold
* Hold reset if LSA not required during entire max
* Default start of 0
* Hold and max 5000ms (no progressive increase)
* `timers throttle lsa all start-internval hold-interval max-interval`
* Can ignore an LSA upon arrival if too often, `timers lsa arrival MS`
* Ignore if same LSA in that time
* Default is 1000ms
* Should be smaller than initial hold in LSA throttling, otherwise sending sooner than accepted
## Incremental ISPF
* Can be enabled per router, `ispf`
* Only affected part of SPF tree recalc'd
## OSPFv2 Prefix Suppression
* Suppresses transit link prefixes, not links themselves
* All stubs in type 1 corresponding to prefixes used on P2Ps can be suppressed
* Omits stubs for p2p ints to other routers
* For type 2s, IP prefix computed by bitwise AND of LSID and netmask
* Routers not implementing RFC install host route to DR
* `prefix-suppression` - all ints except loopback
* `ip ospf-prefix-suppression [disable]` - per int
## Stub Router Config
* Makes router a non transit
* 12.2(4)T and UP
* Can be set to advertise on time period or completion of BGP convergence
* `max-metric router-lsa on-startup TIME - seconds`
* `max-metric router-lsa on-start wait-for-bgp` - Waits for BGP convergence of 10m
## Graceful Restart
* RFC 3623
* NSF before GR (cisco prop)
* Router in GR mode, neighbours in helper
* Lack of hellos in grace ignored
* Considers fully adjacent
* Still seen as DR
* every IOS router can be helper
* Mainly chassis as GR
* Can continue forwarding assuming line cards use last FIB version, OSPF process uses grace LSA (type 9) with grace period, restart reason and IP, LSDB stable during restart, all neighbours support and config'd as helper
* Fully adj neighbours must be helper
## Graceful Shutdown
**Under process**
* Drop all OSPF adj, max age LSAs, hellos with 0.0.0.0 DR BDR, empty neighbour list, stop OSPF packets
**Under Int**
* As above but withour DR and BDR stuff
## OSPFv3
* Advertises multiple networks per int
* RID Must be set (no automatic choosing)
* Link LSA link local, AS scope for AS external, rest area scope
* Multiple instances per link
* Auth done by v6 itself
* Only type 1 and type 2 trigger spf, type 8 and 9 do not
### V3 in nbma
* As per v2, other end must be link-local, other addresses rejected in `ipv6 ospf neighbour` command
### v3 over FR
* No InverseARP so need v6/DLCI mappings
* Link local needs broadcast keyword
### Auth and Encryption
* Enable AH with ipv6 ospf authentication, ipv6 ospf encryption for ESP
* ESP or AH, not both, ESP does auth and encryp
* Need to define ipsec SPI to use
* Can uyse auth key chains, but they do not provide encryption
* Same SPI, AH/ESP mode, algorithm and keys to match
## AF Support
* AF Support possible
* 0 base v6 unicast, 32 base v6 multicast, 64 v4 unicast, 96 v4 multicast, up from each is local policy
* Uses base ID if not config'd
* SPF and calc independent of one another
* If packet seen in AF instance with no AF bit, other side doesn't support it, so never establishes adj
* Encap is v6, must have it to transport
* VLs only for v6 unicast AFs
### Prefix suppression
* Omits transit prefixes in type 8s and 9s
* Can be per AF or global
### Graceful Shut
* Hellos with router priority of 0
* Stops accepting hellos
* Flush all originated LSAs except type 1s
* Flush type 1s with too high cost
* After dead interval and neighbours dead, flush own type 1
## Fast Hellos
* Set with `ip ospf dead-interval minimal hello-multiplier N`
* Sets hellos to under a second
* Can send btetween 3 and 20 every second (i.e. every 50ms)
* Hellos adv as 0
* Dead interval must be consistent on segment
## Flooding Reduction
* ELiminates need for LSA refresh
* Does not suppress hellos
* All routers still need to support demand circuits
* `ip ospf flood-reduction`
## MAX LSA
* Limit non-self genned LSAs with max-lsa NUMBER
## Redistribution
* redistribute maximum-prefix NUMBER PERCENT-THRESHOPLD [warning-only]
## LSA Pacing
* Instead of refreshing moment half life age, awaits pacing interval to group several LSas
* Usually short than 30m, default 240s
* timers pacing flood lsa-group retransmission
* Retrans - every time router needs to retransmis unack'd LSA, waits to group
* Flood - Similar except controls interface LSA flood list - pacing on an int, grouping what could go on int, default 33ms, retrans 66ms
## Third Party Next Hop
* Picks it up from redist'd route (also from BGP, picks up last AS in AS_PATH as external route tag)
* For FA (forward address) to be used, int wher third party next hop should be in OSPF with network command, and not P2P or P2MP
* Maintained throughtout OSPF domain due to type 5 flooding
* 3rd Party Next Hop - explicit NH, not implicit deviced by sending router 
## OSPF Network Types and NH processing
* B'cast and NB - no modification
* P2P, NBMA, P2MP - NH is advertising router
|Type|Default For|DR/BDR|Notes|Unicast Nei|Timer|

# Processes
## Neighbourship
* Send hello, init state, seen null, RID 1.1.1.1
 * Other router goes init
* Other router 2way, sends hello, seen 1.1.1.1, RiD 2.2.2.2
* First router 2 way, seen 1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, RID 1.1.1.1 hello sent
* DR Election if needed
* R1 to R2, R1 exstart, DD sent
* R2 to R1 - R2 exstart, DD sent
* R1 and R2 exchange with DD
* R1 and R2 loading with LS messages
* Both go full
### States
* Down - Initial, neighbour torn down, implies router knows about other
* Attempted - NBMA or P2MP-NB, back to down in dead time
* Init - Hello seen, no own rid in seen
* 2 way - Hello seen, own RID seen
* Exstart - Master/Slave, Empty DBDs compare RIDs, agree on start seq
* Exchange - DBDs
* Loading LSAs
* Full
