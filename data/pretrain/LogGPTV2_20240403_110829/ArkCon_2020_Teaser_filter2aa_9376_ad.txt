The full program can be found under `program.c`.
This looks like a classic task for Z3, we just need to translate the C code into Python. It's mostly trivial, but we do have some weird snippets such as:
```c
local358 = 	label$42:
local496 = local482;
(local496 = ord('!'))
    s.add(key[i] <= ord('~'))
local288 = key[0]
local289 = key[1]
# ...
local323 = key[40]
local452 = 0
local41 = local288
local370 = local41 ^ -1
local206 = local370 & 208
local42 = local288
local207 = local42 & -209
local411 = local206 | local207
local453 = local411 - 184
local329 = abs(local453)
local77 = local452
local165 = local77 + local329
local452 = local165
local88 = local289
local387 = local88 ^ -1
local266 = local387 & 146
local99 = local289
local271 = local99 & -147
local444 = local266 | local271
