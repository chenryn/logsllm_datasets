### Kerberos Preauthentication

Kerberos preauthentication is enabled by default in most environments. However, some older protocols may not support preauthentication, leading to the possibility of this setting being disabled. To enhance security, it is recommended to ensure that all accounts have preauthentication enabled whenever possible. Additionally, it is important to audit any changes made to this setting.

Windows tools, such as PowerShell, can be used to identify which accounts have preauthentication disabled. This allows administrators to take appropriate action to secure these accounts and monitor for any unauthorized changes.
