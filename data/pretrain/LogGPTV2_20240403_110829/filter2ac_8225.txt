Adversaries may disrupt the availability of system and network resources by preventing legitimate users from accessing their accounts. This can be achieved through various methods, such as deleting, locking, or manipulating user accounts (e.g., changing credentials). Additionally, adversaries may log off the system or perform a shutdown/reboot to ensure that the malicious changes take effect.
