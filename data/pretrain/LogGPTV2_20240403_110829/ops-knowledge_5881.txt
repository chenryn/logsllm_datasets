User: Please explain what is load balancing? List several load balancing algorithms, and explain their characteristics, advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Load balancing refers to the technology of distributing requests to multiple servers under high load conditions to achieve reasonable utilization of resources and improve system performance and availability. Load balancing can be implemented by software or hardware, and the common algorithms are as follows: 1. Round-robin algorithm: Assign requests to different servers in turn, and execute them in turn, which is simple and efficient. However, when the processing capabilities of the servers are inconsistent, it is easy to waste resources. 2. The least number of connections algorithm: Send the request to the server with the least number of current connections to prevent a single server from being overloaded. However, when the processing power of the servers varies greatly, the problem of over-allocation of tasks may occur. 3. Source address hash algorithm: According to the source address of the request, the request is sent to a fixed server to ensure that the same request is sent to the same server to ensure the sessionability of some applications. However, when the number of servers changes, this algorithm can lead to reallocation problems. 4. Weighted round-robin algorithm: allocate requests according to different weights of servers, which can realize reasonable allocation of resources. The disadvantage is that the weight needs to be set manually, which may not be accurate in practical applications. 5. Weighted least number of connections algorithm: Combines the least number of connections algorithm and weighted polling algorithm to build a dynamic weight of system resource usage. When the processing capabilities of the servers are not equal, it is better to achieve load balancing. In general, each load balancing algorithm has its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and it can be selected and adjusted according to application requirements and actual conditions to achieve the optimal effect.
