titleblackhat:us-21 Turing in a Box: Applying Artificial Intelligence as a Service to Targeted Phishing and Defending Against AI Generated Attacks
With recent advances in next-generation language models such as OpenAI's GPT-3, AI generated text has reached a level of sophistication that matches or even exceeds human generated output. The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) products places these capabilities in the hands of a global market, bypassing the need to independently train models or rely on open-source pre-trained models. By greatly reducing the barriers to entry, AIaaS gives consumers access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities at a fraction of the cost through user-friendly APIs.In our research, we present a novel approach that uses AIaaS to improve the delivery of Red Team operations - in particular, the conduct of phishing campaigns. We developed a targeted phishing pipeline that uses OpenAI and Personality Analysis AIaaS products to generate persuasive phishing emails. Our pipeline automatically personalizes the content based on the target's background and personality. We observed that AI generated phishing content outperformed those that were manually created by Red Team operators. Furthermore, the pipeline freed up Red Team resources to focus on higher-value work such as context building and intelligence gathering.In addition, we present an AIaaS-powered phishing defense framework to detect such attacks. Compared to traditional classification-based email filters, our framework adapts deep learning language models such as OpenAI's GPT-3 to accurately distinguish between AI and human generated text. This allows security teams to mount a credible defense against advanced AI text generators without requiring significant AI expertise or resources.Our research provides actionable takeaways for both red and blue teams to prepare for the current reality of advanced AI proliferation. We discuss the long-term implications of this trend and recommend high-level strategies such as AI governance frameworks to safeguard against the abuse of AIaaS products.
