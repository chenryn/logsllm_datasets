**ATT&CK ID:** M0932  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Multi-Factor Authentication

**Recommendation:**
Implement strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all remote service accounts to reduce the risk of unauthorized access by adversaries using stolen credentials. Additionally, be aware that some MFA implementations can be vulnerable to interception techniques. Ensure that you use robust and up-to-date MFA solutions to mitigate these risks.
