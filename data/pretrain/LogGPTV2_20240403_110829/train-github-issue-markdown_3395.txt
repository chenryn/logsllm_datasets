# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Right now it's possible to set space around pre-made zones (Columns, Rows,
Grid, Priority Grid).  
It would be nice to have that option for custom zones we define for ourselves.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
I suppose shrinking all the zones by the space value should work.
