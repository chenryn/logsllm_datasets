# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
Currently, it is possible to set spacing around pre-defined zones such as Columns, Rows, Grid, and Priority Grid. This feature would be extended to allow users to set spacing for custom zones they define themselves.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
One approach to implementing this feature could be to uniformly shrink all custom zones by the specified spacing value. This would ensure that the spacing is consistently applied around each custom zone.
