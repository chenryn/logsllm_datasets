Abstract
Phones are used to conﬁrm some of our most sensi-
tive transactions. From coordination between energy
providers in the power grid to corroboration of high-
value transfers with a ﬁnancial institution, we rely on
telephony to serve as a trustworthy communications
path. However, such trust is not well placed given the
widespread understanding of telephony’s inability to
provide end-to-end authentication between callers.
In
this paper, we address this problem through the Authen-
tiCall system. AuthentiCall not only cryptographically
authenticates both parties on the call, but also provides
strong guarantees of the integrity of conversations made
over traditional phone networks. We achieve these
ends through the use of formally veriﬁed protocols that
bind low-bitrate data channels to heterogeneous audio
channels. Unlike previous efforts, we demonstrate that
AuthentiCall can be used to provide strong authentica-
tion before calls are answered, allowing users to ignore
calls claiming a particular Caller ID that are unable or
unwilling to provide proof of that assertion. Moreover,
we detect 99% of tampered call audio with negligible
false positives and only a worst-case 1.4 second call
establishment overhead.
In so doing, we argue that
strong and efﬁcient end-to-end authentication for phone
networks is approaching a practical reality.

Introduction
Telephones remain of paramount importance to society
since their invention 140 years ago, and they are espe-
cially important for sensitive business communications,
whistleblowers and journalists, and as a reliable fallback
when other communication systems fail. When faced
with critical or anomalous events, the default response
of many organizations and individuals is to rely on the
telephone. For instance, banks receiving requests for
large transfers between parties that do not generally
interact call account owners.
Power grid operators
who detect phase synchronization problems requiring
careful remediation speak on the phone with engineers
in adjacent networks. Even the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) recommends that citizens
in disaster areas rely on phones to communicate sensitive
identity information (e.g., social security numbers) to
assist in recovery [29]. In all of these cases, participants
depend on telephony networks to help them validate
claims of identity and integrity.
However, these networks were never designed to pro-
vide end-to-end authentication or integrity guarantees.
Adversaries with minimal
technical ability regularly
take advantage of this fact by spooﬁng Caller ID, a vul-
nerability enabling over $7 billion in fraud in 2015 [34].
More capable adversaries can exploit weaknesses in
core network protocols such as SS7 to reroute calls and
modify content [15]. Unlike the web, where mechanisms
such as TLS protect data integrity and allow experts
to reason about the identity of a website, the modern
telephony infrastructure simply provides no means for
anyone to reason about either of these properties.
In this paper, we present AuthentiCall, a system
designed to provide end-to-end guarantees of authen-
tication and call content integrity over modern phone
systems (e.g., landline, cellular, or VoIP). While most
phones have access to some form of data connection,
that connection is often not robust or reliable enough
to support secure VoIP phone calls. AuthentiCall
uses this often low-bitrate data connection to mutually
authenticate both parties of a phone call with strong
cryptography before the call is answered. Even in the
worst case, this authentication adds at most a negligible
1.4 seconds to call establishment. Once a call is estab-
lished, AuthentiCall binds the call audio to the original
authentication using specialized, low-bandwidth digests
of the speech in the call. These digests protect the
integrity of call content and can distinguish legitimate
audio modiﬁcations attributable to the network from

99% of maliciously tampered call audio even while a
typical user would expect to see a false positive only
once every six years. Our system is the ﬁrst to use these
digests to ensure that received call audio originated from
the legitimate source and has not been tampered with
by an adversary. Most critically, AuthentiCall provides
these guarantees for standard telephone calls without
requiring changes to any core network.
Our work makes the following contributions:
• Designs Channel Binding and Authentication Pro-
tocols: We design protocols that bind identities to
phone numbers, mutually authenticate both parties of
a phone call, and protect call content in transit.
• Evaluates Robust Speech Digests for Security: We
show that proposed constructions for digesting speech
data in systems that degrade audio quality can be made
effective in adversarial settings in real systems.
• Evaluates Call Performance in Real Networks: Our
prototype implementation shows that the techniques
pioneered in AuthentiCall are practical and perfor-
mant, adding at most only 1.4 seconds to phone call
establishment in typical settings.
We

lem [2, 9, 17, 21, 43, 47, 56, 77].
However, other
approaches have relied upon weak heuristics, fail to
protect phone calls using the public telephone network,
are not available to end users, neglect to protect call
content, are trivially evaded, or add signiﬁcant delay
to call establishment. AuthentiCall is the only system
that authenticates phone calls and content with strong
cryptography in the global telephone network with neg-
ligible latency and overhead. We compare AuthentiCall
to other existing or proposed systems in Section 9.

invisible to customers, signiﬁcant transformations occur
to call audio between source and destination. Whereas
the content of data packets on the Internet should not be
modiﬁed between source and destination, call audio is
transcoded by gateways to ensure that it is compatible
with the underlying network. As such, users of the global
telephony infrastructure can only be guaranteed that an
approximate but not bitwise identical representation of
their voice will be delivered to the other end of the call.
Any other data that may be generated by a user or
their home network is not guaranteed to be delivered
or authenticatable end-to-end. That is, because the
underlying technologies are heterogeneous, there is no
assurance that information generated in one system is
passed (much less authenticated) to another. This has
two critical implications. The ﬁrst is that any proofs of
identity a user may generate to their provider are not sent
to the other end of the call. For instance, a mobile phone
on a 4G LTE connection performs strong cryptographic
operations to prove its identity to its provider. However,
there exists no means to share such proofs with a callee
within this system let alone one in another provider’s
network. Second, claims of identity (e.g., Caller ID) are
sent between providers with no means of verifying said
claims. As evidenced by greater than $7 billion in fraud
in 2015 [34], it is extremely simple for an adversary to
trick a receiver into believing any claim of identity. There
is no simple solution as calls regularly transit multiple in-
termediate networks between the source and destination.
It is increasingly common that modern phones have
simultaneous access to at least low-bitrate data channels.
VoIP phones naturally have a secondary data channel, the
majority of mobile phones allow users to both talk and
use data networks simultaneously, and even some circuit-
switched connections (e.g., ISDN) provide phones with

2 Background
Modern telephony systems are composed of a mix of
technologies. As shown in Figure 1, the path between a
caller and callee may transit through multiple networks
consisting of mobile cores, circuit-switched connections
and packet-switched backbones. While the ﬂow of a
call across multiple network technologies is virtually

does not mean that all calls can be simply converted to
VoIP. For example, cellular data in many places does not
support the high data-rate or quality of service necessary
for intelligible calls. Moreover, it is unlikely that any
provider will entirely scrap their non-VoIP infrastruc-
ture. Accordingly, we argue that the presence of this
low-bitrate data channel creates opportunities to develop
a uniform means of end-to-end authentication across the
heterogeneous mechanisms for delivering call audio.
3 Security Model
Figure 2: Broad overview of attacks possible on Caller
ID and call content in current telephony landscape.
In order
to authenticate voice calls and content,
AuthentiCall will face adversaries with a range of
capabilities. The simplest adversary will attempt to
commit phone fraud by spooﬁng Caller ID when calling
a target [59, 60]. An equivalent form of this attack
may occur by the adversary tricking their target
to
call an arbitrary number under their control (e.g., via
spam or phishing) and claiming to represent some other
party (e.g., a ﬁnancial institution) [46]. Additionally,
this adversary may perform a call forwarding attack,
which forces a target calling a legitimate number to be
redirected to the adversary. Lastly, the adversary may
place a voice call concurrent with other legitimate phone
calls in order to create a race condition to see which call
arrives at the destination ﬁrst. In all of these cases, the
goal of the adversary is to claim another identity for the
purpose of extracting sensitive information (e.g., bank
account numbers, usernames, and passwords).
A more sophisticated adversary may gain access to
a network core via vulnerabilities in systems such as
SS7 [15], or improperly protected legal wiretapping
infrastructure [74]. This adversary can act as a man-in-
the-middle, and is therefore capable of redirecting calls
to an arbitrary endpoint, acting as an arbitrary endpoint,
hanging up one side of a call at any point in time, and
removing/injecting audio to one or both sides. Such an
adversary is much more likely to require nation-state
level sophistication, but exists nonetheless. Examples of
both classes of adversary are shown in Figure 2.
Given that the bitwise encoding of audio is unlikely
to be the same at each endpoint, end-to-end encryption
is not a viable means of protecting call content or
integrity across the heterogeneous telephony landscape.
Moreover, while we argue that the majority of phones
have access to at least a low-bandwidth data connection,
solutions that demand high-speed data access at all
times (i.e., pure VoIP calls) do not offer solutions for
the vast majority of calls (i.e., cellular calls). Finally,
we claim no ability to make changes throughout the
vast and disparate technologies that make up the core
networks of modern telephony and instead focus strictly
on addressing this problem in an end-to-end fashion.
We deﬁne four participants: the Caller (R), the Callee
(E), the Server (S), and the Adversary (Adv). Callers
and Callees will register with the AuthentiCall service
as described in the next section and will generate
credentials1 that include a public key. AuthentiCall will
achieve the following security goals in the presence of
the above-described adversaries:
1. (G1) Proof of Number Ownership: During the pro-
cess of registration, R will actively demonstrate own-
ership of its claimed Caller ID to S before it receives
a signed certiﬁcate.
2. (G2) Authentication of the Caller: E will be able
to cryptographically verify the identity of R prior to
accepting an incoming call.
3. (G3) Authentication of the Callee: R will be able to
cryptographically verify the identity of E as soon as
the call begins.
4. (G4) Integrity Protection of Call Content: R and
E will be able to verify that the analog voice content
has not been meaningfully altered, or that new content
has not been injected by a man in the middle. Addi-
tionally, both will also be protected against concurrent
call attacks.
5. (G5) Proof of Liveness: Both R and E will be able to
detect if the other party is no longer on the call, per-
haps as the result of a man in the middle attempting
to engage in the call after the initial authentication.
We note that AuthentiCall does not provide conﬁden-
tiality guarantees. While recent work has shown how to
build systems that support anonymous calling [31], en-
crypting call audio end-to-end in lossy, heterogeneous
telephone networks remains an open problem.
4 Protocol Design and Evaluation
Previously, we saw that AuthentiCall has ﬁve security
goals to meet, and this section describes the three proto-
cols that AuthentiCall uses to achieve these goals. These

These protocols make use of certiﬁcates issued to
each client that indicate that a particular client controls
a speciﬁc phone number. In prior work we proposed a
full public key infrastructure for telephony [56] called a
“TPKI” that would have as its root the North American
Numbering Plan Administration with licensed carriers
acting as certiﬁcate authorities. This PKI would issue
an authoritative certiﬁcate that a phone number is owned
by a particular entity, and AuthentiCall could enforce
