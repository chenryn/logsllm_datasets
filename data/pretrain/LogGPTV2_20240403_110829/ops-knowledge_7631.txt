User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Using SSH to find access to a problematic script in logs of multiple domains I run several (~20) sites on a Dreamhost VPS. Lately I max my memory allocation for the VPS and I want to find the problem.

I would like to have an SSH script that will scan all the log files of all the domains and show me what object (image, php script etc) gets lots of calls.

It will count the calls in each /logs/*/http/access.log, do an descending sort and show me the top 10 across domains.

But I don't know how to do that.

Can it be done?

Can anyone suggest a script that will do that?

Assistant: The bit where you asked for a script to "...count the calls in each /logs/*/http/access.log, do an descending sort and show me the top 10 across domains." can be achieved with this:

grep -o " /[^ ]*" /logs/*/http/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head


But you could get the same information out of AWStats or Google analytics.  It's really just a list of all URLs aggregated and sorted by the number of times each one was accessed.

That same pattern of Unix commands can be used to aggregate your PHP errors and Apache errors which might be more useful in your particular situation.  For instance the following:

grep -o " PHP.*" /logs/*/php/error.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head


Will find all the PHP errors from your php error log (I guessed where you might keep it.) and list the 10 most frequent ones.

Another useful one is:

grep -o " PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size.*" /logs/*/php/error.log | sed 's/tried to allocate [0-9]* bytes/tried to allocate N bytes/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head


Which will find all your out-of-memory errors and group them together.
