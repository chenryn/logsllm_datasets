User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题High system cpu load (%sys), system locks For the last two weeks we are having intermittent severe spikes in system cpu usage (shown as %sys), which last for maybe half a minute, locking most processes, including ssh.

I've been trying to figure this out, but atop doesn't show anything relevant (system usage for processes it shows is insignificant), spikes are intermittent and I could not reproduce the spike using any workload for the web application this webserver hosts.

If you have any ideas on how to debug high %sys and (sometimes) %si CPU usage, please share them.

System specs (don't know if any of this is relevant): Dedicated server, CentOS 6, core i7 950, consistent 4 to 8 GB RAM free at any time, hard drives are in RAID-1.

Additional info:


dmesg output doesn't change between spikes
/var/log/messages doesn't change between spikes
Here is cat /proc/vmstat  
Here is output of mpstat 1 during a typical spike


Add 07.11.11: looks like simple reboot restored system state, and we might never know what caused the disturbance in first place.

Assistant: I know this thread is a really old and I know you are already aware of this,
%sys --> if the cycle is spent in %system then much of the execution is done in lower level code i.e might be issue on kernel side. If this issue is reproducible again, please collect the output of:

echo t &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger


And check system messages (var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog) to see if any thread may be using a lot of system CPU time.
