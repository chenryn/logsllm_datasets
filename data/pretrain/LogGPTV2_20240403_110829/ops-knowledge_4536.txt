Assistant: This log chunk is related to the system's network and power management. It includes processes such as corecaptured, kernel, blued, sandboxd, and networkd. The log shows that the system is waking up, connecting to devices, and managing power sources. It also shows that the system is discarding active and inactive pages, as well as purgable and special pages.
