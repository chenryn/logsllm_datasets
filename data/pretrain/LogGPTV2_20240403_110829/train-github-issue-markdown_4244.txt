matplotlib's `pyplot.hist` and `pyplot.hist2d` functions fill the supplied
data into histogram bins and plot them, but very often users will have already
done the first step (sorting data into bins) in their own code and are merely
interested in presenting their results in a "style" that is evocative of
histograms (most commonly: bar chart with no separation for 1D data, colored
grid for 2D data).
Right now they can do this by using the `pyplot.bar` and `pyplot.imshow`
functions for 1D and 2D data, respectively, but they have to fill in a bunch
of arguments to make it look like something produced by `pyplot.hist` or
`pyplot.hist2d` and they have to find out that those two are the right
functions for the job in the first place (not very intuitive).
Hence I think it would be good if there were separate functions or maybe just
special arguments to `pyplot.hist/hist2d` that allow you to plot bin _values_
(as opposed to data that is yet to be binned) as histograms that look exactly
as if they had been produced by `pyplot.hist/hist2d`.
