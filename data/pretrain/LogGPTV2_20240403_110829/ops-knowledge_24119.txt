User: We need to count the CPU usage and memory usage of an application in order to optimize and expand the performance of the application. Please provide a feasible monitoring plan, including monitoring indicators and collection methods.
Assistant: Monitoring indicators: 1. CPU usage rate 2. Memory usage collection method: 1. Monitoring tools in the operating system: use monitoring tools provided by the operating system, such as top, ps, free and other commands, to obtain real-time usage of CPU and memory . 2. Monitoring based on system performance tools: For example, tools such as perf, dstat, sar, and sysstat can collect CPU data every second and provide FPS, CPU load, frequency, temperature, disk usage, network load, and memory Occupancy and other related data. 3. Monitoring through the application's API: Many applications provide APIs through which developers can collect useful information about the application. For example, the v8-profiler module of Node.js provides monitoring support for JavaScript stack and CPU processing time, which can be used to check memory leaks and performance bottlenecks in the application. 4. Third-party monitoring tools: You can use third-party monitoring tools such as Zabbix, Nagios, Ganglia and other software to monitor CPU usage and memory usage. These tools can collect monitoring data and generate alarms or reports.
