**Title: Botconf 2015 - The Missing Piece in Threat Intelligence**

Information sharing has become increasingly crucial in mitigating security threats. From public feeds to private mechanisms for exchanging data among security researchers, the number of threat intelligence sources now often exceeds the number of entities being monitored. These resources have proven valuable for enterprise defense. However, from the perspective of infrastructure providers, current threat intelligence data and tools are clearly insufficient.

In this presentation, we will discuss the limitations we have identified in existing threat intelligence feeds and propose ways to enhance their overall quality and relevance by involving infrastructure providers. Additionally, we will demonstrate ERIS, an open-source implementation of our proposal, which will be released during Botconf 2015.
