1 简介
日志信息包含日志的参数介绍、产生原因、处理建议等，为用户进行系统诊断和维护提供参考。
除了 S5560-EI特有的日志信息外，本文还包含 S5560-EI Release1109版本基于的 Comware V7
平台版本的日志信息，其中的部分日志信息本产品可能并不支持，请以设备的实际情况为准。
本文假设您已具备数据通信技术知识，并熟悉H3C网络产品。
1.1 日志格式说明
缺省情况下，日志采用RFC3164定义的格式：
TIMESTAMP HOSTNAME %%vendorMODULE/severity/MNEMONIC:locationAttributes;
description
表1-1 日志字段说明
字段 描述
优先级标识符，仅存在于输出方向为日志主机的日志信息。优先级的计算公式
为：facility*8+level
 • facility表示工具名称，由info-center loghost命令设置，主要用于在日志
主机端标志不同的日志来源，查找、过滤对应日志源的日志
• level表示日志信息的等级，具体含义请参见表2
时间戳记录了日志信息产生的时间，方便用户查看和定位系统事件。用户可以
TIMESTAMP
自定义时间显示格式
HOSTNAME 生成该日志信息的设备的名称或IP地址
厂家标志，%%10 表示本字段表示本日志信息由H3C设备生成
%%vendor
本字段只有在日志信息发往日志主机时才会存在
MODULE 生成该日志信息的功能模块的名称
severity 日志信息的等级，具体说明请参见表2
MNEMONIC 助记符，本字段为该日志信息的概述，是一个不超过32个字符的字符串
定位信息，为该日志信息的产生者。本字段的具体内容可能为：
• 单板槽位号（分布式设备—独立运行模式）
• IRF（Intelligent Resilient Framework，智能弹性架构）的成员设备编号
（集中式IRF设备）
locationAttributes • IRF的成员设备编号和单板槽位号（分布式设备—IRF模式）
• 日志发送者的源IP
本字段是可选字段，格式如下：
-attribute1=x-attribute2=y…-attributeN=z
日志位置信息和日志描述之间用分号和空格“; ”分隔
该日志的具体内容，包含事件或错误发生的详细信息
description
对于本字段中的可变参数域，本文使用表3定义的方式表示
日志信息按严重性可划分为如表2所示的八个等级，各等级的严重性依照数值从0～7依次降低。
1
表1-2 日志等级说明
级别 严重程度 描述
0 Emergency 表示设备不可用的信息，如系统授权已到期
1 Alert 表示设备出现重大故障，需要立刻做出反应的信息，如流量超出接口上限
2 Critical 表示严重信息，如设备温度已经超过预警值，设备电源、风扇出现故障等
3 Error 表示错误信息，如接口链路状态变化，存储卡拔出等
4 Warning 表示警告信息，如接口连接断开，内存耗尽告警等
5 Notification 表示正常出现但是重要的信息，如通过终端登录设备，设备重启等
表示需要记录的通知信息，如通过命令行输入命令的记录信息，执行ping命
6 Informational
令的日志信息等
7 Debug 表示调试过程产生的信息
本文使用表3定义的方式表示日志描述字段中的可变参数域。
表1-3 可变参数域
参数标识 参数类型
INT16 有符号的16位整数
UINT16 无符号的16位整数
INT32 有符号的32位整数
UINT32 无符号的32位整数
INT64 有符号的64位整数
UINT64 无符号的64位整数
DOUBLE 有符号的双32位整数，格式为：[INT32].[INT32]
HEX 十六进制数
CHAR 字节类型
STRING 字符串类型
IPADDR IP地址
MAC MAC地址
DATE 日期
TIME 时间

1.3 文档使用说明
本文将系统日志信息按照软件模块分类，每个模块以字母顺序排序，在每个模块中，系统日志信
息按照助记符的名称，以字母顺序排序。
本文以表格的形式对日志信息进行介绍。有关表中各项的含义请参考表5。
表1-5 日志信息表内容说明
表项 说明 举例
ACL [UINT32] [STRING] [COUNTER64]
日志内容 显示日志信息的具体内容
packet(s).
$1：ACL编号
按照参数在日志中出现的顺序对参数进行解释
参数解释 参数顺序用“$数字”表示，例如“$1”表示 $2：ACL规则的ID和内容
在该日志中出现的第一个参数 $3：与ACL规则匹配的数据包个数
日志等级 日志严重等级 6
一个真实的日志信息举例。由于不同的系统设
ACL/6/ACL_STATIS_INFO: ACL 2000
置，日志信息中的“TIMESTAMP
举例 rule 0 permit source 1.1.1.1 0 logging
HOSTNAME %%vendor”部分也会不同，本
10000 packet(s).
文表格中的日志信息举例不包含这部分内容
匹配一条ACL规则的数据包个数。该日志
日志说明 解释日志信息和日志生成的原因
会在数据包个数发生变化时输出
建议用户应采取哪些处理措施。级别为6的
处理建议 “Informational”日志信息是正常运行的通知 系统正常运行时产生的信息，无需处理
信息，用户无需处理
