I wanted to make a small script that picks a random file, ask some questions
about it and then go to the next file. I don't really need a full-fledged
Command, would it be possible to move helpers like Question helper to their
own component? (1) Right now i would have to use the Command component and set
a default command (because i don't really need a "command"). It would be nice
if the question helper just uses the default stdin stdout if those arguments
are not supplied. (2). And secondly it would help if the Question helper has
some convenient methods to create the questions. (3). I imagine a usage like
this:
    $helper = new QuestionHelper(); // pass optional other InputInterface / OutputInterface
    $colors = $helper->choice(
            'Please select your favorite color (defaults to red)',
            array('red', 'blue', 'yellow'),
            0);
    // .. $helper -> another question
Same for being able to send color output to the console.
