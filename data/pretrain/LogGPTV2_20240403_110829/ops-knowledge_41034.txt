User: Several processes with the same name are running on host. What is the cross-platform way to get PIDs of those processes by name using python or jython?

I want something like pidof but in python. (I don't have pidof anyway.)
I can't parse /proc because it might be unavailable (on HP-UX).
I do not want to run os.popen('ps') and parse the output because I think it is ugly (field sequence may be different in different OS).
Target platforms are Solaris, HP-UX, and maybe others.
Assistant: There isn't, I'm afraid. Processes are uniquely identified by pid not by name. If you really must find a pid by name, then you will have use something like you have suggested, but it won't be portable and probably will not work in all cases.
If you only have to find the pids for a certain application and you have control over this application, then I'd suggest changing this app to store its pid in files in some location where your script can find it.
