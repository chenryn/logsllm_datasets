I am getting the following
    ERROR in ./src/main.jsx
    Module build failed: SyntaxError: /Users/sam/src/main.jsx: 'this' is not allowed before super() (This is an error on an internal node. Probably an internal error)

When I try to compile the following:
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    class Main extends React.Component {
      constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {};
      }
      myHandler = () => {
        this.setState({newState: true});
      };
      render() {
        return (
        );
      }
    }
It is only failing when I include `this` inside the myHandler function. There
have been several issues similar to this, I had hoped this would resolve when
#2942 was closed, but I'm still seeing it in the latest 6.1.19.
My babel settings look like:
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            query: {
              presets: ['es2015', 'stage-0', 'react']
            }
