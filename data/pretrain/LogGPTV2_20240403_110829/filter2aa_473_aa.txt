Talking About Suicide
Contagion: Exposure to suicide or suicidal behavior directly or indirectly 
(via media) influences others to attempt suicide.
Talking About Suicide
Responsible Journalism & Social Media Standards
What We Should Say
How We Should Say It
"Committed"
Instead, use "completed" or "died by"
Don't present suicide as a means to a certain end, a 
valid coping mechanism, or an understandable solution 
CDC Recommendations on Suicide Contagion & Reporting
Instead, use "completed" or "died by"
Suicide is never the result of a single 
factor or event
Suicide is the result of extremely 
complex interactions between 
psychological, social, and medical 
problems
Suicide results, most often, from a long 
history of problems
valid coping mechanism, or an understandable solution 
to a specific problem
Don't make venerating statements out of context 
(e.g. "She was a great kid with a bright future.") 
Do temper coverage of displays of grief
Do promote coping strategies and post links to 
prevention resources

Person in Crisis (PIC)

Risk Assessment

A Quick Sidebar
On Depression:
•
A period of depression is not the same as having a mood disorder
o
Online tests can help you self-diagnose and follow up with a professional.
o
You don't need to be diagnosed with a mental illness to benefit from talking about life.
o
Depressive (and manic) phases ebb and flow in severity. Use the calmer times to make a

Depressive (and manic) phases ebb and flow in severity. Use the calmer times to make a 
safety plan.
•
Avoid these well intentioned slippery slopes:
o
"You have to cultivate happiness"
o
"We create the world around us"
o
"You just need more will power"
People with mental illnesses can't 
"just snap out of it"
