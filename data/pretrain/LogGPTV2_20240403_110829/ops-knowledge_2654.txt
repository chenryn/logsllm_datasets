User: Please describe the application scenarios and advantages of virtualization technology.
Assistant: Virtualization technology is a technology that abstracts, isolates and multiplexes physical hardware resources, and can provide independent virtual environments for multiple applications or operating systems. The application scenarios of virtualization technology are quite extensive. The following are some common scenarios: 1. Server virtualization: virtualize one physical server into multiple virtual servers to improve server utilization and resource sharing. 2. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): Provides users with virtual desktops to access their assigned applications and data anywhere, improving flexibility and security. 3. Application virtualization: Virtualize applications and their dependent software and libraries, port and share between different systems and versions. 4. Nested virtualization: Running a virtual machine in a virtual environment to test a new operating system or application. The advantages of virtualization technology include: 1. Improvement of resource utilization and flexibility: virtualization technology enables different virtual machines to run independently to achieve effective use of hardware resources. At the same time, virtual machines can be quickly created, started and stopped for flexible deployment and management. 2. Improve availability and reliability: Virtualization technology can dynamically move virtual machines among multiple physical servers to coordinate load and achieve high availability and fault tolerance. 3. Improve security and isolation: Virtualization technology isolates multiple virtual machines to reduce the possibility of mutual influence, and at the same time better protect data privacy and security. 4. Reduce cost and waste of resources: Virtualization technology can virtualize several physical servers into one to reduce hardware purchase and maintenance costs, and reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.
