User: I am trying to use the ipyparallel library to run an ipcontroller and ipengine on different machines.
My setup is as follows:
Remote machine:
Windows Server 2012 R2 x64, running an ipcontroller, listening on port 5900 and ip=0.0.0.0.
Local machine:
Windows 10 x64, running an ipengine, listening on the remote machine's ip and port 5900.
Controller start command:
ipcontroller --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=5900 --reuse --log-to-file=True
Engine start command:
ipengine --file=/c/Users/User/ipcontroller-engine.json --timeout=10 --log-to-file=True
I've changed the interface field in ipcontroller-engine.json from "tcp://127.0.0.1" to "tcp://" for ipengine.
On startup, here is a snapshot of the ipcontroller log:

And the ipengine log:

(There is a 12.5 hour time difference between the local  machine and the remote VM)
Any idea why this may happen?
Assistant: If you are using --reuse, make sure to remove the files if you change settings. It's possible that it doesn't behave well when --reuse is given and you change things like --ip, as the connection file may be overriding your command-line arguments.
When setting --ip=0.0.0.0, it may be useful to also set --location=a.b.c.d where a.b.c.d is an ip address of the controller that you know is accessible to the engines. Changing the 
If registration works and subsequent connections don't, this may be due to a firewall only opening one port, e.g. 5900. The machine running the controller needs to have all the ports listed in the connection file open. You can specify these to be a port-range by manually entering port numbers in the connection files.
