I am currently using the Android Scripting Environment (ASE) with Python, and I would like to terminate the shell that is executing the script when the script itself terminates.

Is there an effective way to achieve this?

I have attempted to use the following code on the last line of my script:
```python
os.system('kill %d' % os.getppid())
```
However, this approach did not work as intended.

**Assistant:**
To properly exit the shell in the Android Scripting Environment (ASE), you should use the `android.exit()` function. This function will terminate the ASE shell and close the script execution gracefully.

Example:
```python
import android

# Your script logic here

# Exit the ASE shell
android.exit()
```

This method ensures that the shell is terminated correctly when your script completes.
