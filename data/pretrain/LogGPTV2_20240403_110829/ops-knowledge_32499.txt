User: So I've been working with Python on my computer for about the last 2 months with no issues. Just recently however, something went wrong with IDLE. I am running python 2.5
I used to be able to right-click and select "Edit with IDLE" for a python program. That option no longer is available. When I try "open with" and navigate to the idlelib in python, I can select idle.bat, idle.py, or idle.py (no console). I've tried each option and each fails to open and returns an error that either it is not a valid Win32 application or that "Windows cannot find idle.pyw"
I am able to open IDLE on its own and use the open function in IDLE to open files, but can't open files directly using IDLE as I could before.
There was formerly the White background icon with the python logo, which is now replace by windows' logo for no program (white square, blue and red dots). I have tried to repair-install and unistall-re-install both with no success. There is no firewall or antivirus, and it was installed with permissions for all users. 
Any help is much appreciated, this has been maddeningly difficult to figure out.
Assistant: The native one that comes with python on windows is problematic at times, so you could uninstall and reinstall it as a solution, or open it from its directory instead of a shortcut, or get another IDE. I recommend the Ninja IDE very nice and light looking, or if you're on linux you could just use vim from terminal.
Also, if it's extremely necessary, try upgrading your python version and IDE. I think the IDE included for windows looks like a modified emacs to be honest.
