Challenges
๏ TV is nothing like how it really happens in real life
• Don't believe the hype
๏ Most producers/editors/execs were not technical 
and didn't care to be
• Were only interested in the ﬁnal result
๏ Did not understand the complexity of the tasks
• Assumed everything was easy
๏ Wanted unrealistic projects that had never been 
done before built in two weeks or less
• Ex.: X-ray glasses, personal force ﬁeld
๏ How to make engineering sexy?
