## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a formal approach to compute performance metrics for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems with high confidence. We address the challenge of quantifying performance in the presence of noise sources such as quantization and randomness in Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs. By defining best, bounded, and average-case performance, we use probabilistic model checking to verify these properties and provide statistical guarantees. If a property fails, we present a characterization and diagnostic mechanism to localize the source of errors. Our approach significantly improves scalability and efficiency, particularly in the context of state space explosion. We illustrate our methodology on seminal MIMO components, including a Viterbi decoder and a MIMO detector, and show that it can be applied to a broad class of communication system designs.

## 1. Introduction
There is a growing demand for reliable communication systems that operate at high data rates. These systems, especially in the physical and digital layers, need to be area and power efficient. The Bit Error Rate (BER) is a commonly used performance measure, representing the probability that a transmitted bit is decoded incorrectly. In wireless communication systems, BER requirements can be as stringent as 10^-7. MIMO systems, designed to meet these requirements, are complex and include numerous digital blocks, which introduce internal fixed-point quantization errors.

Conventionally, performance estimation for MIMO RTL is done using Monte Carlo simulations, which are time-consuming and incomplete. FPGA implementations and ASIC prototypes provide accelerated performance estimates but are costly. We propose a methodology that uses probabilistic model checking for performance estimation. This approach explores all possible paths of a given length, ensuring complete and high-confidence performance analysis. MIMO RTL designs are modeled as Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMCs), and performance metrics, including best, worst, and average case, are defined in Probabilistic Computational Logic (pCTL). We use PRISM, a probabilistic model checker, to verify these pCTL properties, providing formal guarantees of performance.

## 2. Related Work
Markov chains have been used to model and analyze the reliability of hardware, but these models often restrict the size of the systems that can be analyzed due to excessive detail. For example, gate-level models are used to design circuits with high error tolerance and to analyze stability, but they are infeasible for large RTL designs. Our work focuses on analyzing the performance of RTL designs, which are bit and cycle-accurate descriptions of digital blocks. We capture both internal and external errors, making our approach more scalable and applicable to a broader class of communication system designs.

## 3. Error Modeling
In a communication system with digital blocks in the receiver, analog signals are converted into bits by discretizing them in time and value. A bit error occurs if the decoded bit does not match the actual transmitted bit. We confine our analysis to the digital blocks, assuming knowledge of the statistical performance of the analog blocks. Using a bit-accurate RTL description, we capture internal quantization errors in addition to external errors. Noise is modeled as a large number of small circuit imperfections, represented as a single random variable following an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) model. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) represents the ratio of signal power to noise power.

This comprehensive approach ensures that our performance metrics are rigorously defined and verified, providing robust statistical guarantees for MIMO designs.
