User: Find and fix a computer network failure, which can cause problems such as dropped packets or delays.
Assistant: Symptoms: There are delays and packet loss problems in the network connection. Solution: 1. Check whether the network hardware devices are normal, such as routers, switches and other devices, and try to solve the fault by restarting the device or replacing the device. 2. Check whether the network cable is connected stably. If it is loose or damaged, replace the cable. 3. Check whether the network configuration is correct, such as whether the IP address, subnet mask, gateway and other settings are consistent with the network topology. If there is any inconsistency, the configuration parameters need to be modified. 4. Check whether the network load is reasonable. If the network traffic is too large, you can solve the problem by limiting the network traffic or increasing the network bandwidth. 5. If the above methods cannot solve the problem, you can try to upgrade the network device software or replace the network device and other measures.
