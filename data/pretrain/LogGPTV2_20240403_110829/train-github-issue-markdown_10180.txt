Right now interfaces use the same syntax for properties with and without
accessors. This is fine for duck typed interfaces, but the problem is, there
is no way to specify properties with only one part (getter or setter) present.
Usually, they are read only, without setter. The problem is, we can't tell
this to a compiler, so it will not warn us when assigning to such a prop and
JS runtime will simply ignore this assignment without throwing.
It would be good to have syntax like this
    interface IEmployee{
         get fullName: string;
         set firstName: string;
         set lastName: string; 
    }
to prevent such errors.
