Hi,
I'm trying to make a component where I want to reuse the same projected 'ng-
content' but it doesn't seem to be possible. It would be nice if angular could
iterate through all the unnamed ng-contents and replace them.
Here is a use case example.
    @Component({
      selector: 'wt-link',
      template: `
    `
    })
    class LinkComponent {
      ...
    }
    My Link Name
The link is displayed in another way if the route is active and I want more
changes than simple CSS.
Is there any workaround?
