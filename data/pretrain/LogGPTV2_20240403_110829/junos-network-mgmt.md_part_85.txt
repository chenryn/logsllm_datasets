Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer named employee-monitor has been created on the device with the appropriate
input interfaces and the appropriate output interface.
Action
To verify that the analyzer is configured as expected while monitoring all employee traffic on the source
switching device, run the show forwarding-options analyzer command on the source switching device. The
following output is displayed for this configuration example.
user@device> show forwarding-options analyzer
Analyzer name : employee-monitor
Mirror rate : 2
Maximum packet length : 128
State : up
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
1067
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Output VLAN : default-switch/remote-analyzer
Meaning
This output shows that the employee-monitor instance has a ratio of 2, the maximum size of the original
packet that were mirrored is 128, the state of the configuration is up, which indicates proper state and
that the analyzer is programmed, and the analyzer is mirroring the traffic entering ge-0/0/0.0 and
ge-0/0/1.0, and is sending the mirrored traffic to the VLAN called remote-analyzer.
If the state of the output interface is down or if the output interface is not configured, the value of State
will be down and the analyzer will not be able to monitor traffic.

Mirroring All Employee Traffic to Multiple VLAN Member Interfaces for Remote Analysis | 1070
Verification | 1077
EX9200 switches allow you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering or exiting a VLAN on
You can analyze the mirrored traffic using a protocol analyzer application running on a remote
monitoring station if you are sending mirrored traffic to an analyzer VLAN.
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
1068
• Disable your configured mirroring analyzers when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by:
• Using statistical sampling.
• Setting ratios to select statistical samples.
• Using firewall filters.
This example describes how to configure remote mirroring to multiple interfaces on an analyzer VLAN:
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• Three EX9200 switches
• Junos OS Release 13.2 or later for EX Series switches
Before you configure remote mirroring, be sure that:
• The interfaces that the analyzer will use as input interfaces have been configured on the switch.
Overview and Topology
IN THIS SECTION
Topology | 1070
This example describes how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch to the remote analyzer VLAN
so that you can perform analysis from a remote monitoring station. The remote-analyzer VLAN in this
example contains multiple member interfaces. Therefore, the same traffic is mirrored to all member
interfaces of the remote-analyzer VLAN so that mirrored packets can be sent to different remote
monitoring stations. You can install applications, such as sniffers and intrusion detection systems, on
remote monitoring stations to analyze these mirrored packets and to obtain useful statistical data. For
instance, if there are two remote monitoring stations, you can install a sniffer on one remote monitoring
1069
station and an intrusion detection system on the other station. You can use a firewall filter analyzer
configuration to forward a specific type of traffic to a remote monitoring station.
This example describes how to configure an analyzer to mirror traffic to multiple interfaces in the next-
hop group so that traffic is sent to different monitoring stations for analysis.
Figure 36 on page 1069 shows the network topology for this example.

the Next-Hop Group

Topology
In this example:
• Interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 are Layer 2 interfaces (both interfaces on the source switch) that
serve as connections for employee computers.
• Interfaces ge-0/0/10 and ge-0/0/11 are Layer 2 interfaces that are connected to different
destination switches.
• Interface ge-0/0/12 is a Layer 2 interface that connects the Destination 1 switch to the remote
monitoring station.
• Interface ge-0/0/13 is a Layer 2 interface that connects the Destination 2 switch to the remote
monitoring station.
• VLAN remote-analyzer is configured on all switches in the topology to carry the mirrored traffic.

Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure basic remote mirroring to two VLAN member interfaces:
1. On the source switch:
1072
• Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
• Configure the interfaces on the network port connected to destination switches for access mode
and associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
user@switch# set ge-0/0/11 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
user@switch# set ge-0/0/11 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
• Configure the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/0.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input egress interface ge-0/0/0.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input egress interface ge-0/0/1.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output next-hop-group remote-analyzer-nhg
In this analyzer configuration, traffic that enters and exits interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 and ge-0/0/1.0
are sent to the output destination defined by the next-hop group named remote-analyzer-nhg.
• Configure the remote-analyzer-nhb next-hop group:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set next-hop-group remote-analyzer-nhg interface ge-0/0/10.0
user@switch# set next-hop-group remote-analyzer-nhg interface ge-0/0/11.0
user@switch# set next-hop-group remote-analyzer-nhg group-type layer-2
2. On the Destination 1 switch:
1073
• Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
• Configure the ge-0/0/10 interface on the Destination 1 switch for access mode:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode access
• Configure the interface connected to the remote monitoring station for access mode:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/12 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode access
• Configure the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress vlan remote-analyzer
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor loss-priority high output interface ge-0/0/12.0
