**User:** I have developed a "Hello World" website using Google App Engine with Django 1.1, without any patches. Despite its simplicity, the page often takes a long time to load and frequently times out. Do you have any suggestions for resolving this issue? 

*Note: The response time is significantly faster after the initial request.*

**Assistant:** To address the slow loading times and frequent timeouts, you can consider the following steps:

1. **Enable Warmup Requests:** In Google App Engine, you can configure your application to receive warmup requests. This ensures that your instances are ready to handle traffic before they start receiving actual user requests, which can help reduce the initial cold start delay.

2. **Optimize Django Settings:** Review and optimize your Django settings. For example, ensure that you are using the most efficient database backend, and consider caching mechanisms like Memcached or Redis to speed up data retrieval.

3. **Use a More Recent Version of Django:** Django 1.1 is quite outdated. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Django, which will likely include performance improvements and better support for modern web development practices.

4. **Monitor and Profile Performance:** Use tools like Google Cloud Monitoring or third-party services like New Relic to monitor and profile your application's performance. This can help you identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

5. **Adjust Instance Configuration:** Ensure that your App Engine instance class is appropriately configured for your workload. You may need to adjust the number of instances or the type of instances (e.g., F1, F2, etc.) to better handle the load.

6. **Use Pingdom for Monitoring:** As you mentioned, using Pingdom can help you track the availability and response time of your application. Regular monitoring can provide insights into when and why your application is experiencing delays.

By implementing these strategies, you should be able to improve the performance and reliability of your "Hello World" website.
