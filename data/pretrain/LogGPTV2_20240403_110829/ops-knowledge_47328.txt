User: I created a Hello World website in Google App Engine. It is using Django 1.1 without any patch.
Even though it is just a very simple web page, it takes long time and often it times out.
Any suggestions to solve this?
Note: It is responding fast after the first call.
Assistant: I used pingdom for obvious reasons - no cold starts is a bonus. Of course the customers will soon come flocking and it will be a non-issue
