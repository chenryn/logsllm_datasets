User: How do you configure SSH keys for passwordless login?
Assistant: Here are the steps to configure SSH keys for passwordless login: 1. Generate Key Use the following command to generate an SSH key on your local computer. ``` ssh-keygen -t rsa ``` This command will prompt you for a location and name to save the key, and a passphrase (if required). By default, keys will be stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. 2. Add the public key to the target computer Use the following command to add the public key to the `authorized_keys` file of the target computer, so that the SSH key can be used when logging in remotely to the target computer. ``` ssh-copy-id <username>@<remote_host> ``` Replace `<username>` with the username on the target computer, and `<remote_host>` with the IP address or domain name of the target computer. This command will ask you to enter the target computer's login password. Once done, the public key should have been added to the target computer's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. 3. Test passwordless login Now you can use SSH keys to connect to the target computer without entering a password. ``` ssh <username>@<remote_host> ``` If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to log in to the target machine without a password.
