Abstract
With the ubiquity of data breaches, forgotten-about ﬁles stored
in the cloud create latent privacy risks. We take a holistic ap-
proach to help users identify sensitive, unwanted ﬁles in cloud
storage. We ﬁrst conducted 17 qualitative interviews to char-
acterize factors that make humans perceive a ﬁle as sensitive,
useful, and worthy of either protection or deletion. Building
on our ﬁndings, we conducted a primarily quantitative online
study. We showed 108 long-term users of Google Drive or
Dropbox a selection of ﬁles from their accounts. They labeled
and explained these ﬁles’ sensitivity, usefulness, and desired
management (whether they wanted to keep, delete, or pro-
tect them). For each ﬁle, we collected many metadata and
content features, building a training dataset of 3,525 labeled
ﬁles. We then built Aletheia, which predicts a ﬁle’s perceived
sensitivity and usefulness, as well as its desired management.
Aletheia improves over state-of-the-art baselines by 26% to
159%, predicting users’ desired ﬁle-management decisions
with 79% accuracy. Notably, predicting subjective perceptions
of usefulness and sensitivity led to a 10% absolute accuracy
improvement in predicting desired ﬁle-management decisions.
Aletheia’s performance validates a human-centric approach
to feature selection when using inference techniques on sub-
jective security-related tasks. It also improves upon the state
of the art in minimizing the attack surface of cloud accounts.
1 Introduction
Since the introduction of Dropbox in 2007, cloud storage has
become a convenient and aﬀordable way to retain ﬁles over
time and sync ﬁles across multiple devices with minimal user
eﬀort. However, with the passage of time, some ﬁles lose their
relevance. Crucially, some ﬁles that are no longer useful may
still contain sensitive information, creating risks due to data
breaches, lost devices, and account takeovers [5, 53, 58].
The free versions of consumer cloud services provide giga-
bytes of storage, which is more than enough for thousands of
documents and media ﬁles to pile up over the years. While
making indeﬁnite retention of ﬁles the default option has
freed users from the risks of lost USB sticks and crashed hard
drives, this policy also causes potentially sensitive informa-
tion to accumulate in a single place. While this agglomeration
of sensitive data is risky, manual management is far too time
consuming and tedious to be practical. Thus, some form of
automated assistance is quickly becoming necessary.
While researchers have characterized this need for retro-
spective management of consumer cloud archives [24, 49],
they did not propose any concrete techniques for identifying
which ﬁles users should revisit. Likewise, although Microsoft
recently added a “Personal Vault” [41] to the OneDrive cloud
platform that adds 2FA protection to a speciﬁc folder, decid-
ing which ﬁles to put in such a folder is a manual process.
Because revisiting thousands of ﬁles that have accumulated
over many years is time consuming, the foundation of any
practical protection approach must be some form of auto-
mated inference. Even so, the subjective and human-centered
nature of ﬁle management requires understanding what makes
a ﬁle in the cloud sensitive, as well as what makes it expend-
able. Information rights management (IRM) [31] and data-loss
prevention (DLP) [7, 18] have superﬁcially similar goals of
preventing the unwanted disclosure of information, though we
hypothesized that identifying sensitive and useless ﬁles would
diﬀer between corporate and consumer domains. For instance,
whereas industry focuses on identiﬁers (e.g., account num-
bers), consumers might also consider ﬁles sensitive if they
cast them in a negative light or violate their self-presentation.
Our results validated this hypothesis.
In this paper, we present a multi-part approach to devel-
oping an automated inference pipeline that predicts the per-
ceived sensitivity and usefulness of ﬁles stored in the cloud.
Due to the highly subjective nature of sensitivity and useful-
ness, as well as the incomplete understanding provided by
prior work, we ﬁrst explore users’ mental models of these
concepts qualitatively. With the goal of enumerating the many
ways diﬀerent people might consider a ﬁle sensitive or useful,
we conducted 17 interviews. We found that participants con-
sidered ﬁles sensitive for objective reasons like the presence

of ﬁnancial data or personally identiﬁable information, as
well as subjective reasons like the presence of content consid-
ered intimate in the participant’s unique context. Participants
considered ﬁles useful not only based on the recency of ﬁle
access, but also based on sentimentality and relationships.
Subsequently, we acted on this holistic understanding by
constructing and evaluating classiﬁers through primarily quan-
titative user studies. A key challenge is that sensitive ﬁles, our
primary target, are very much a minority class within cloud
archives. As a result, we conducted two rounds of online user
studies. In each round, we showed participants dozens of ﬁles
from their own Google Drive or Dropbox accounts, asking
them to rate (and explain) the sensitivity and usefulness of
each ﬁle. We collected numerous metadata and content fea-
tures for each ﬁle, as well as for the cloud account overall.
In Round 1 we showed 75 participants ﬁles selected from
their account using heuristics inspired by our interviews. We
trained a preliminary classiﬁer using the data collected. To fur-
ther mitigate the class imbalance for ﬁle sensitivity, in Round 2
we showed 33 additional participants ﬁles selected based on
our preliminary classiﬁer. With the combined data, we trained
and evaluated a ﬁnal classiﬁer, which we dub Aletheia.1
Aletheia performs three prediction tasks.
It predicts
whether a user will perceive a given ﬁle as (i) sensitive and
(ii) no longer useful. Finally, it predicts (iii) a ﬁle-management
decision specifying whether the ﬁle should be kept, deleted,
or protected (e.g., requiring 2FA). Based on prior work [24],
we hypothesized that users’ ﬁle-management decisions would
roughly correlate with ﬁle sensitivity and usefulness as shown
in Figure 1. We compared Aletheia against typical baselines
of assigning labels based on the majority class and randomly.
In addition, for predicting ﬁle sensitivity, we also compared
against a baseline that uses the output of Google’s Data Loss
Prevention API (GDLP, Section 2.2). For predicting ﬁle use-
fulness, we used the time since the ﬁle was last modiﬁed as
an additional baseline. To the best of our knowledge, no prior
work examines subjective classiﬁcation of ﬁle usefulness and
sensitivity, so we selected these heuristic baselines to reﬂect
features that correlate most intuitively with those perceptions.
Aletheia is novel in its aim to identify ﬁles in consumer
cloud accounts that users perceive as sensitive and no longer
useful. Aletheia augments ﬁle access patterns and the objec-

tive identiﬁers (e.g., Social Security Numbers) captured by
industry IRM [31] and DLP [7, 18] tools with numerous ﬁle
metadata and content features that capture subjective charac-
teristics our formative qualitative work found to be associated
with human perceptions of a ﬁle as sensitive or useful.
We found that Aletheia substantially improves the state of
the art for identifying ﬁles in the cloud that users are likely
to perceive as sensitive and no longer useful. For predicting
sensitivity, Aletheia showed an AUC improvement of 68%
for documents and 153% for images over a classiﬁer that
used only GDLP features. Predicting ﬁles as no longer useful,
Aletheia’s AUC improvement was 26% for documents and
101% for images when compared to the last modiﬁed classiﬁer.
Predicting participants’ desired ﬁle management, the accuracy
improvement was 49% over the most sensible baseline, a
majority label classiﬁer.
In developing Aletheia, we made three key contributions:
• We performed 17 qualitative interviews to understand
factors that lead a human to perceive a ﬁle in their cloud
storage account as sensitive and no longer useful.
• We conducted online user studies of 108 users of Google
Drive or Dropbox. Our quantitative and qualitative re-
sults characterize the relationship between desired ﬁle-
management decisions and perceptions of ﬁle sensitivity
and usefulness. While most participants nearly always
elected to delete ﬁles they deemed not useful, some still
preferred to retain ﬁles deemed not useful.
• We constructed classiﬁers that automatically identify
ﬁles likely to be perceived as sensitive and not useful.
These classiﬁers improve over state-of-the-art baselines
by 26% to 159%. They can also identify users’ desired
ﬁle-management decisions with 79% accuracy. We fur-
ther unpacked Aletheia’s performance, analyzing mispre-
dictions relative to participants’ qualitative responses.
2 Related Work
Previous scholarship related to this project spans multiple sub-
areas, including those that characterize the risks and harms
of online data, user-focused understanding of data sensitivity,
personal information management, and the design of auto-
mated tools to infer and manage online privacy preferences.
2.1 Risks of Online Data and Cloud Storage
The possibility of being harmed by data breaches is very real.
Governments [11, 38] and academic researchers [14, 30, 34]
have highlighted risks and damages potentially caused by
malicious actors stealing users’ private data. Researchers have
evaluated how individuals perceive online privacy [21, 25],
identifying associated risks [35] and the magnitude of those
risks in various scenarios [10, 48, 57]. Entrusting data to a
third party can increase the risk of data breaches, which have

of data retention has become a key part of online security.
Researchers have evaluated the risks of data breaches
on multiple cloud storage systems [22]. Studies have fo-
cused on latent danger in the cloud in comparison to local
storage [23], user perceptions of the inadvertent storage of
sensitive data [9], and strategies for minimizing risk [32].
Complementary work has evaluated ﬁle-management prac-
tices [52, 56]. More recent user research has found that most
users have forgotten-about data they wish to delete stored in
the cloud [24]. Researchers have also studied users’ mental
models of cloud storage [4] and data retention [36,45,55]. We
build upon these insights through user studies and classiﬁer
construction to automatically identify risky ﬁles in the cloud.
2.2 Data Sensitivity and Data-Leak Detection
Data sensitivity is subjective, and there is no universal deﬁ-
nition of the term. There have been extensive eﬀorts in the
community to detect and quantify potentially sensitive data
in various contexts. Peddinti et al. used anonymous Quora
posts to understand the sensitivity of questions in a Q&A fo-
rum [42]. They found that, in addition to expected topics like
religion, sex, and drugs, questions about emotions, relation-
ships, and careers were also seen as sensitive. Researchers
have also developed initial methods to detect potential nu-
dity [47] and violence [37] in image and video ﬁles. The
presence of nudity or violence commonly suggests that the
data is sensitive. While we built on their understanding of
sensitive questions, our investigation of ﬁles — including doc-
uments, images, and other media — required a far broader
understanding of sensitivity.
Recent eﬀorts in industry have codiﬁed IRM and DLP
methods for preventing data leaks [7, 18, 31]. While the goals
of these eﬀorts — preventing unwanted disclosures of infor-
mation — are superﬁcially similar to ours, the characteristics
associated with ﬁle sensitivity and usefulness diﬀer between
corporate and consumer domains. Industry approaches fo-
cus on identiﬁers (e.g., bank account numbers). For instance,
Google’s Cloud Data Loss Prevention API [18] aims to clas-
sify and redact sensitive information from documents and
is primarily marketed to organizations. The API categorizes
numerous personal and ﬁnancial identiﬁers as sensitive, par-
tially through regex matching. Additional industry IRM solu-
tions [5,31] use both regex matching and access-management
frameworks to tag sensitive data. However, such eﬀorts are
most applicable for information sharing within an organiza-
tion. Critically, they do not incorporate subjective perceptions
of ﬁle sensitivity or usefulness into the decision process. For
instance, consumers might also consider a ﬁle sensitive if it vi-
olates their intended presentation of self, as might be the case
for ill-advised poetry or embarrassing photographs. While
we make use of Google’s Cloud Data Loss Prevention API
as a baseline for comparison and as one source of features
for Aletheia, our approach takes a much broader view of sen-
sitivity. We began with a qualitative study to characterize
perceptions of data sensitivity, incorporating this understand-
ing into subsequent parts of our project. Augmenting the
Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention API features with others
that capture subjective characteristics substantially improved
classiﬁcation accuracy (Section 7).
2.3 Automated Management of Privacy
The large quantity of forgotten-about data in the cloud re-
quires semi-automated inference to help users revisit poten-
tially sensitive ﬁles [24]. In the same spirit, researchers have
proposed techniques for automated management of privacy
settings. For social networks, Fang and LeFevre proposed
a “privacy wizard” for automatic inference of privacy set-
tings [12], while Ghazinour et al. used collaborative ﬁlter-
ing to recommend privacy settings [16]. There have also
been eﬀorts to build classiﬁers around user-level privacy
scores [29] and privacy risk [60]. Similar research focuses on
inferring sensitive attributes and identity matching in online
platforms [15,17,26,28,59]. Some researchers have also used
classiﬁers to predict desired permissions for image ﬁles [51]
and whether content should be private or public [13, 50]. To
our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to develop a classiﬁer for au-
tomated management of ﬁles in cloud storage, especially a
classiﬁer based on sensitivity ratings of private ﬁles collected
from the owners of those ﬁles in user studies, as opposed to a
third party rating publicly available ﬁles.
3 Approach
This section summarizes our approach (Figure 2) to automat-
ically helping users ﬁnd sensitive and unwanted ﬁles in the
cloud. We elaborate on our process and high-level goals. We
also explain how we dealt with the associated challenges.
1. Understanding Sensitivity and Usefulness: For ﬁles
in the cloud, terms like sensitivity and usefulness can have
subjective interpretations that vary across individuals. With
the goal of enumerating the variety of these perceptions, we
ﬁrst conducted qualitative interviews. These interviews were
conducted as open discussions to encourage individuals to
highlight all possible ﬁle attributes associated with sensitiv-
ity and usefulness. Subsequently, we mapped these attributes
to quantitative ﬁle features that can be collected program-
matically. These interviews also inﬂuenced the design of our
quantitative survey. Section 4 details these interviews.
2. Training Data Collection and Augmentation: A pre-
requisite for developing an automated classiﬁer is collecting
training features and labels. To this end, we performed a quan-
titative study of 108 long-term users of Google Drive and
Dropbox. The study combined a user survey with automated
collection of various features about participants’ cloud ac-
counts and ﬁles. These features included metadata provided
