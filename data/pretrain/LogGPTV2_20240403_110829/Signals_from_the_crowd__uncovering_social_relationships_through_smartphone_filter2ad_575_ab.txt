### Analysis of Vendors and PNL Exposure

The study by Musa et al. [32] indicates that the vendors in our list are among the market leaders for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. This suggests that our datasets capture a representative sample of the most commonly used mobile devices.

A key question is how the choice of a particular vendor affects the probability that all or part of the PNL is exposed through directed probe requests. This is relevant for security and privacy, as an adversary could use commodity hardware to collect SSIDs from a user's PNL and perform an Evil Twin man-in-the-middle attack [4]. Additionally, the names of the networks can reveal sensitive information about the user, such as their place of residence, work, and frequently visited locations.

Figure 2 shows the percentage of devices from each vendor that disclosed part of their PNL:
- **RIM**: 92%
- **HTC**: 55%
- **Sony**: 35%
- **Apple**: 35%
- **Samsung**: 31%
- **Nokia**: 13%

### 4.2 SSIDs Analysis

WiFi access points are increasingly common in public environments like restaurants, hotels, and pubs, leading to a higher probability that users connect to these networks. We hypothesize two effects:
1. Popular SSIDs of public places should be found in many devices.
2. A significant fraction of PNLs should store more than one SSID.

We reconstructed the PNLs of the devices in our datasets by collecting all directed probe requests. The total number of devices with a non-empty PNL is around 59K. The results for Politics 1 (P1), Vatican 1 (V1), University (U), and the Mall, as well as for all datasets together (All), are shown in Figure 3.

#### Figure 3: Distribution of the Popularity of SSIDs and Sizes of PNLs

- **(a) SSIDs**: The distribution of the popularity of SSIDs across different datasets.
- **(b) PNLs**: The distribution of the sizes of the PNLs.

The distributions are heavy-tailed, with very few highly popular access points coexisting with hundreds of thousands of SSIDs stored in a few PNLs. This trend is consistent across different datasets, including local events (P1, Mall), international events (V1), and long-term datasets (U). Many popular SSIDs are related to public WiFi networks, such as city-wide networks and tourist attractions.

The lengths of the PNLs show a peculiar shape: up to about 16, the curves follow a heavy-tailed distribution, followed by a peak and a steep drop. This is due to many vendors limiting the number of different networks to which directed probe requests can be sent, often to 16. For example, this limit is hard-coded in the Android OS wireless driver source code.

For the All dataset:
- 50% of PNLs store one SSID only.
- 30% store between two and ten SSIDs.
- 20% store more than ten SSIDs.

### 4.3 Uncovering the Underlying Social Network

Our work demonstrates how WiFi probes can be used to uncover important information about a crowd, including its social structure. The PNL of a device can be seen as a list of significant places visited by the user. If two users share one or more SSIDs in their PNLs, it may indicate a social relationship, supported by recent findings on human behavior [14, 10].

#### 4.3.1 From Affiliation Networks to Social Networks

The SSIDs in the PNLs can be represented as an affiliation network [23, 5], where:
- **V1**: The set of devices that disclosed at least one entry of their PNL.
- **V2**: The set of SSIDs.
- **E**: An edge (v1, v2) represents v1 having v2 in its PNL.

From this affiliation network, we can build a social network ¯G = (V1, ¯E) between devices by defining a similarity measure f : V1 × V1 → R. We impose a minimum threshold τ and place an edge {u, v} ∈ ¯E only if f(u, v) > τ.

A suitable similarity measure is the Adamic-Adar [1] measure, which penalizes popular SSIDs in favor of those shared by fewer people:

\[ f_{\text{ADA}}(u, v) = \sum_{w \in N(u) \cap N(v)} \frac{1}{\log_2(|M(w)|)} \]

This measure takes into account both the intersection of the PNLs and the popularity of the SSIDs, providing a more accurate representation of social relationships.
