Abstract
Graphical password schemes have been proposed as
an alternative to text passwords in applications that
support graphics and mouse or stylus entry.
In
this paper we detail what is, to our knowledge, the
largest published empirical evaluation of the eﬀects
of user choice on the security of graphical password
schemes. We show that permitting user selection of
passwords in two graphical password schemes, one
based directly on an existing commercial product,
can yield passwords with entropy far below the the-
oretical optimum and, in some cases, that are highly
correlated with the race or gender of the user. For
one scheme, this eﬀect is so dramatic so as to ren-
der the scheme insecure. A conclusion of our work
is that graphical password schemes of the type we
study may generally require a diﬀerent posture to-
ward password selection than text passwords, where
selection by the user remains the norm today.
1 Introduction
The ubiquity of graphical interfaces for applications,
and input devices such as the mouse, stylus and
touch-screen that permit other than typed input,
has enabled the emergence of graphical user authen-
tication techniques (e.g., [2, 8, 4, 24, 7, 30]). Graphi-
cal authentication techniques are particularly useful
when such devices do not permit typewritten input.
In addition, they oﬀer the possibility of providing a
form of authentication that is strictly stronger than
text passwords. History has shown that the dis-
tribution of text passwords chosen by human users
has entropy far lower than possible [22, 5, 9, 32],
and this has remained a signiﬁcant weakness of user
authentication for over thirty years. Given the fact
that pictures are generally more easily remembered
than words [23, 14], it is conceivable that humans
would be able to remember stronger passwords of a
graphical nature.
In this paper we study a particular facet of graphical
password schemes, namely the strength of graphi-
cal passwords chosen by users. We note that not
all graphical password schemes prescribe user cho-
sen passwords (e.g., [24]), though most do (e.g., [2,
8, 3, 4, 7]). However, all of these schemes can be
implemented using either system-chosen or user-
chosen passwords, just as text passwords can be
user-chosen or system-chosen. As with text pass-
words, there is potentially a tradeoﬀ in graphical
passwords between security, which beneﬁts by the
system choosing the passwords, and usability and
memorability, which beneﬁt by permitting the user
to choose the password.
Our evaluation here focuses on one end of this
spectrum, namely user chosen graphical passwords.
The graphical password schemes we evaluate are
a scheme we call “Face” that is intentionally very
closely modeled after the commercial PassfacesTM
scheme [3, 24] and one of our own invention (to our
knowledge) that we call the “Story” scheme. In the
Face scheme, the password is a collection of k faces,
each chosen from a distinct set of n > 1 faces, yield-
ing nk possible choices. In the Story scheme, a pass-
word is a sequence of k images selected by the user
to make a “story”, from a single set of n > k im-
ages each drawn from a distinct category of image
types (cars, landscapes, etc.); this yields n!/(n− k)!
choices. Obviously, the password spaces yielded by
these schemes is exhaustively searchable by a com-
puter for reasonable values of k and n (we use k = 4
and n = 9), and so it relies on the authentication
server refusing to permit authentication to proceed
after suﬃciently many incorrect authentication at-
tempts on an account. Nevertheless, an argument
given to justify the presumed security of graphical
passwords over text passwords in such environments
is the lack of a predeﬁned “dictionary” of “likely”
choices, as an English dictionary provides for En-
glish text passwords, for example (c.f., [8, Section
3.3.3]).
For our study we utilize a dataset we collected dur-
ing the fall semester of 2003, of graphical password
usage by three separate computer engineering and
computer science classes at two diﬀerent universi-
ties, yielding a total of 154 subjects. Students used
graphical passwords (from one of the two schemes
above) to access their grades, homework, homework
solutions, course reading materials, etc., in a man-
ner that we describe in Section 3.2. At the end
of the semester, we asked students to complete an
exit survey in which they described why they picked
the faces they did (for Face) or their chosen sto-
ries (for Story) and some demographic information
about themselves.
Using this dataset, in this paper we evaluate the
Face and Story schemes to estimate the ability of
an attacker to guess user-chosen passwords, possibly
given knowledge of demographic information about
the user. As we will show, our analysis suggests
that the faces chosen by users in the Face scheme
is highly aﬀected by the race of the user, and that
the gender and attractiveness of the faces also bias
password choice. As to the latter, both male and
female users select female faces far more often than
male faces, and then select attractive ones more of-
ten than not. In the case of male users, we found
this bias so severe that we do not believe it possible
to make this scheme secure against an online attack
by merely limiting the number of incorrect password
guesses permitted. We also quantify the security of
the passwords chosen in the Story scheme, which
still demonstrates bias though less so, and make rec-
ommendations as to the number of incorrect pass-
word attempts that can be permitted in this scheme
before it becomes insecure. Finally, we benchmark
the memorability of Story passwords against those
of the Face scheme, and identify a factor of the Story
scheme that most likely contributes to its relative
security but also impinges on its memorability.
On the whole, we believe that this study brings into
question the argument that user-chosen graphical
passwords of the type we consider here are likely to
oﬀer additional security over text passwords, unless
users are somehow trained to choose better pass-
words, as they must be with text passwords today.
Another alternative is to utilize only system-chosen
passwords, though we might expect this would sacri-
ﬁce some degree of memorability; we intend to eval-
uate this end of the spectrum in future work.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We
describe related work in Section 2.
In Section 3
we describe in more detail the graphical password
schemes that we evaluate, and discuss our data
sources and experimental setup. In Section 4 we in-
troduce our chosen security measures, and present
our results for them. In Section 5 we discuss issues
and ﬁndings pertinent to the memorability of the
two schemes. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.
2 Related Work
This work, and in particular our investigation of the
Face scheme, was motivated in part by scientiﬁc lit-
erature in psychology and perception. Two results
documented in the psychological literature that mo-
tivated our study are:
• Studies show that people tend to agree about
the attractiveness of both adults and children,
even across cultures.
(Interested readers are
referred to [10] for a comprehensive literature
review on attractiveness.) In other words, the
adage that “beauty is in the eye of the be-
holder,” which suggests that each individual
has a diﬀerent notion of what is attractive, is
largely false. For graphical password schemes
like Face, this raises the question of what in-
ﬂuence general perceptions of beauty (e.g, fa-
cial symmetry, youthfulness, averageness) [1, 6]
might have on an individual’s graphical pass-
word choices. In particular, given these a pri-
ori perceptions, are users more inclined to chose
the most attractive images when constructing
their passwords?
• Studies show that individuals are better able to
recognize faces of people from their own race
than faces of people from other races [31, 20,
11, 29]. The most straightforward account of
the own-race eﬀect is that people tend to have
more exposure to members of their own racial
group relative to other-race contact [31]. As
such, they are better able to recognize intra-
racial distinctive characteristics which leads to
better recall. This so-called “race-eﬀect” [13,
15] raises the question of whether users would
favor members of their own race when selecting
images to construct their passwords.
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no
prior study structured to quantify the inﬂuence of
the various factors that we evaluate here, including
those above, on user choice of graphical passwords,
particularly with respect to security. However, prior
reports on graphical passwords have suggested the
possibility of bias, or anecdotally noted apparent
bias, in the selection or recognition of passwords.
For example, a document [24] published by the cor-
poration that markets PassfacesTM makes reference
to the race-eﬀect, though stops short of indicating
any eﬀect it might have on password choice. In a
study of twenty users of a graphical password sys-
tem much like the Story scheme, except in which the
password is a set of images as opposed to a sequence,
several users reported that they did not select pho-
tographs of people because they did not feel they
could relate personally to the image [4]. The same
study also observed two instances in which users se-
lected photographs of people of the same race as
themselves, leading to a conjecture that this could
play a role in password selection.
The Face scheme we consider here, and minor vari-
ants, have been the topic of several user studies fo-
cused on evaluating memorability (e.g., [34, 27, 28,
3]). These studies generally support the hypothe-
sis that the Face scheme and variants thereof of-
fer better memorability than text passwords. For
instance,
in [3], the authors report results of a
three month trial investigation with 34 students that
shows that fewer login errors were made when us-
ing PassfacesTM (compared to textual passwords),
even given signiﬁcant periods of inactivity between
logins.
Other studies, e.g., [34, 4], have explored memora-
bility of other types of graphical passwords. We em-
phasize, however, that memorability is a secondary
consideration for our purposes. Our primary goal is
to quantify the eﬀect of user choice on the security
of passwords chosen.
3 Graphical Password Schemes
As mentioned earlier, our evaluation is based on two
graphical schemes.
In the Face scheme, the pass-
word is a collection of k faces, each selected from
a distinct set of n > 1 faces. Each of the n faces
are chosen uniformly at random from a set of faces
classiﬁed as belonging to either a “typical” Asian,
Figure 1: In the Face scheme, a user’s password is a
sequence of k faces, each chosen from a distinct set
of n > 1 faces like the one above. Here, n = 9, and
images are placed randomly in a 3 × 3 grid.
black or white male or female, or an Asian, black or
white male or female model. This categorization is
further discussed in Section 3.1. For our evaluation
we choose k = 4 and n = 9. So, while choosing her
password, the user is shown four successive 3 × 3
grids containing randomly chosen images (see Fig-
ure 1, for example), and for each, she selects one im-
age from that grid as an element of her password.
Images are unique and do not appear more than
once for a given user. During the authentication
phase, the same sets of images are shown to the
user, but with the images randomly permuted.
In the Story scheme, a password is a sequence of
k unique images selected by the user to make a
“story”, from a single set of n > k images, each de-
rived from a distinct category of image types. The
images are drawn from categories that depict every-
day objects, food, automobiles, animals, children,
sports, scenic locations, and male and female mod-
els. A sample set of images for the story scheme is
shown in Figure 2.
3.1
Images
As indicated above, the images in each scheme were
classiﬁed into non-overlapping categories. In Face,
there were twelve categories: typical Asian males,
Images of “female models” were gathered from a
myriad of pageant sites including Miss USATM, Miss
UniverseTM, Miss NY Chinese, and fashion mod-
eling sites.
Images of “male models” were gath-
ered from various online modeling sources including
FordModels.com and StormModels.com.
For the Story scheme, the “men” and “women” cat-
egories were the same as the male and female models
in our Face experiment. All other images were cho-
sen from PicturesOf.NET and span the previously
mentioned categories.
To lessen the eﬀect that an image’s intensity, hue,
and background color may have on inﬂuencing a
user choice, we used the ImageMagick library (see
www.imagemagick.org) to set image backgrounds
to a light pastel color at reduced intensity. Ad-
ditionally, images with bright or distracting back-
grounds, or of low quality, were deleted. All remain-
ing images were resized to have similar aspect ratios.
Of course, it is always possible that diﬀerences in
such secondary factors inﬂuenced the results of our
experiment, though we went to signiﬁcant eﬀort to
avoid this and have found little to support a hypoth-
esis of such inﬂuence.
3.2 Experiment
For our empirical evaluation we analyze observa-
tions collected during the fall semester (roughly the
four month period of late-August through early-
December) of 2003, of graphical password usage by
three separate computer engineering and computer
science classes at two diﬀerent universities, yielding
a total of 154 subjects. Each student was randomly
assigned to one of the two graphical schemes. Each
student then used the graphical password scheme
for access to published content including his or
her grades, homework, homework solutions, course
reading materials, etc., via standard Java enabled
browsers. Our system was designed so that instruc-
tors would not post documents on the login server,
but rather that this server was merely used to en-
crypt and decrypt documents for posting or retrieval
elsewhere. As such, from a student’s perspective,
the login server provided the means to decrypt doc-
uments retrieved from their usual course web pages.
Since there was no requirement for users to change
their passwords, most users kept one password for
the entire semester. However, a total of 174 pass-

typical Asian females, typical black males, typical
black females, typical white males, typical white
females, Asian male models, Asian female mod-
els, black male models, black female models, white
male models and white female models. In the Story
scheme, there were nine categories: animals, cars,
women, food, children, men, objects, nature, and
sports.
The images used for each category were carefully
selected from a number of sources. “Typical male”
and “typical female” subjects include faces selected
from (i) the Asian face database [26] which con-
tains color frontal face images of 103 people and
(ii) the AR Face database [17] which contains well
over 4000 color images corresponding to 126 peo-
ple. For the AR database we used images in angle 2
only, i.e, frontal images in the smile position. These
databases were collected under controlled conditions
and are made public primarily for use in evaluating
face recognition technologies. For the most part,
