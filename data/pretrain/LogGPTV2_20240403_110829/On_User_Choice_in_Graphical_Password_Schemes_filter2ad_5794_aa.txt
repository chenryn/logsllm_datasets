**Abstract:**
Graphical password schemes have been proposed as an alternative to text passwords in applications that support graphical interfaces and mouse or stylus input. This paper presents what is, to our knowledge, the largest published empirical evaluation of the effects of user choice on the security of graphical password schemes. We show that allowing users to select their own passwords in two graphical password schemes, one based on an existing commercial product, can result in passwords with entropy far below the theoretical optimum. In some cases, the chosen passwords are highly correlated with the race or gender of the user, rendering one scheme insecure. Our findings suggest that graphical password schemes may require a different approach to password selection compared to text passwords, where user selection remains the norm.

## 1. Introduction
The widespread use of graphical interfaces and input devices such as mice, styluses, and touchscreens has enabled the emergence of graphical user authentication techniques. These methods are particularly useful when typewritten input is not feasible. Additionally, they offer the potential for stronger authentication than text passwords. However, historical data shows that human-chosen text passwords often have low entropy, making them a significant weakness in user authentication. Given that pictures are generally more memorable than words, it is plausible that humans could remember stronger graphical passwords.

In this paper, we study the strength of user-chosen graphical passwords. Not all graphical password schemes allow user-chosen passwords, but most do. As with text passwords, there is a trade-off between security (benefiting from system-chosen passwords) and usability and memorability (benefiting from user-chosen passwords).

Our evaluation focuses on user-chosen graphical passwords in two schemes:
- **Face Scheme:** A collection of \( k \) faces, each chosen from a distinct set of \( n > 1 \) faces, yielding \( n^k \) possible choices.
- **Story Scheme:** A sequence of \( k \) unique images selected by the user to create a "story" from a single set of \( n > k \) images, yielding \( \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \) choices.

We collected data from three computer engineering and computer science classes at two universities, resulting in 154 subjects. Students used graphical passwords to access course materials, and at the end of the semester, they completed an exit survey providing demographic information and reasons for their password choices.

Using this dataset, we evaluate the Face and Story schemes to estimate the ability of an attacker to guess user-chosen passwords, possibly given demographic information. Our analysis reveals that the faces chosen in the Face scheme are significantly influenced by the user's race, gender, and the attractiveness of the faces. Both male and female users prefer female faces, and attractive ones are chosen more frequently. For male users, this bias is so severe that the scheme is insecure against online attacks. The Story scheme also shows bias, though to a lesser extent. We provide recommendations for the number of incorrect password attempts allowed before the scheme becomes insecure. Finally, we compare the memorability of Story and Face passwords and identify factors affecting both security and memorability.

Overall, our study questions the argument that user-chosen graphical passwords offer additional security over text passwords unless users are trained to choose better passwords. An alternative is to use system-chosen passwords, which we plan to evaluate in future work.

## 2. Related Work
Our investigation of the Face scheme was motivated by psychological literature, which shows that people tend to agree on the attractiveness of faces across cultures and are better at recognizing faces of their own race. Prior studies on graphical passwords have suggested the possibility of bias in password selection, but no prior study has quantified these effects on security. Studies on the memorability of graphical passwords generally support the hypothesis that the Face scheme offers better memorability than text passwords.

## 3. Graphical Password Schemes
### 3.1. Face Scheme
In the Face scheme, the password is a collection of \( k \) faces, each selected from a distinct set of \( n > 1 \) faces. Each face is chosen uniformly at random from a set of faces classified into twelve categories: typical Asian, black, or white males and females, and Asian, black, or white male and female models. For our evaluation, we used \( k = 4 \) and \( n = 9 \). During the authentication phase, the same sets of images are shown, but with the images randomly permuted.

### 3.2. Story Scheme
In the Story scheme, the password is a sequence of \( k \) unique images selected by the user to create a "story" from a single set of \( n > k \) images. The images are drawn from nine categories: animals, cars, women, food, children, men, objects, nature, and sports. For our evaluation, we used \( k = 4 \) and \( n = 9 \).

### 3.3. Images
Images were carefully selected from various sources and categorized. To reduce the influence of secondary factors such as image intensity, hue, and background color, we used the ImageMagick library to standardize the images.

### 3.4. Experiment
We collected data from three computer engineering and computer science classes at two universities, resulting in 154 subjects. Each student was randomly assigned to one of the two graphical schemes and used the scheme to access course materials. At the end of the semester, students completed an exit survey providing demographic information and reasons for their password choices.

## 4. Security Analysis
We introduce our chosen security measures and present the results. Our analysis shows that the Face scheme is highly biased by the user's race and gender, making it insecure. The Story scheme also shows bias, but to a lesser extent. We provide recommendations for the number of incorrect password attempts allowed before the scheme becomes insecure.

## 5. Memorability
We discuss issues and findings related to the memorability of the two schemes. We benchmark the memorability of Story passwords against those of the Face scheme and identify factors affecting both security and memorability.

## 6. Conclusion
Our study questions the argument that user-chosen graphical passwords offer additional security over text passwords unless users are trained to choose better passwords. An alternative is to use system-chosen passwords, which we plan to evaluate in future work.
