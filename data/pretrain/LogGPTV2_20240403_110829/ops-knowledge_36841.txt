User: I had trouble to run the pyDev Google App run on Eclipse. I can't create a new run configuration and I get this error message: Path for project must have only one segment.
Any ideas about how to fix it? I am running Eclipse Kepler on Ubuntu 13.10
Assistant: This is clearly a bug, but there's a possible workaround: In a .py file in your project, right-click and go to "Run As."  Then, select "Python Run" (not a custom configuration).  Let it run and crash or whatever this particular module does.  Now, go look at your run configurations - you'll see one for this run.  You can customize it as if you had made it anew.
