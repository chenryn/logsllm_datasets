I am using Google App Engine to fetch feed URLs, but some of these URLs are 301 redirects. I need to obtain the final URL that returns the actual content.

I am currently using the Universal Feed Reader for parsing the URLs. Is there a way or a specific function that can help me get the final, resolved URL?

**Response:**

To obtain the final URL after resolving any 301 redirects, you cannot rely on parsing alone. You will need to perform an HTTP request, such as an `HTTP HEAD` request, to follow the redirect chain and retrieve the final URL.
