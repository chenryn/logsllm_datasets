User: i am using google app engine for fetching the feed url bur few of the urls are 301 redirect i want to get the final url which returns me the result
i am usign the universal feed reader for parsing the url is there any way or any function which can give me the final url.
Assistant: It is not possible to get the 'final' URL by parsing, in order to resolve it, you would need to at least perform an HTTP HEAD operation
