User: What is the HTTPS protocol? How to enable HTTPS on web server?
Assistant: The HTTPS protocol is an encrypted communication protocol based on the Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS), which is used to protect the communication security between the web browser and the server and prevent data from being stolen, tampered with and forged. The HTTPS protocol encrypts and decrypts the transmitted data by using the SSL/TLS encrypted channel to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data during transmission. Enabling the HTTPS protocol on the web server requires the following steps: 1. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted certificate authority, or use a self-signed certificate; 2. Install the SSL/TLS certificate on the web server; 3. Configure the web server so that Provide services under the HTTPS protocol; 4. Update the URL in the web application to ensure that the HTTPS protocol is used when accessing resources. Specific operations can be configured according to different web servers and operating systems. For example, enabling the HTTPS protocol on the Apache server requires modification of the Apache configuration file.
