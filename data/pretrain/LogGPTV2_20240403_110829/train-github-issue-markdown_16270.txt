#### Challenge Name
Noticing this in the Applied Visual Design track, probably elsewhere too
#### Issue Description
When you complete a challenge, the next one loads but the right-hand display
remains the same. It's not possible to see the initial display of the new
challenge unless you manually hit "run code." This isn't an issue when
subsequent challenges build off of each other, but it's noticeable in the
Applied Visual Design track since most of the challenges are quite different
from each other.
