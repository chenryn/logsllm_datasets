User: Is it possible to ckeckout directory from SVN repo to existing project? My motivation: I using PyDev and have a directory with python package and I want to check it out. But problem is subpackages don't see root Python package and I can't add to PYTHONPATH directory which is outside the project. 
What I need is to create a directory with a project and checkout directory with my python package into project directory. But I can't do it with Sublclipse, because it checkout python package directly to the project directory.
Assistant: You must not "check out" the directory, you have to "export" it. You can export anything from svn into any directory.
Also you could simply copy the other directory (from another check out) and delete the hidden .svn directory below it. If the directory contains subdirectories, every .svn directory must be deleted in the subdirectories as well.
