### pwlauncher: Enabling or Disabling Windows To Go Startup Options

The `pwlauncher` command-line tool allows you to configure a computer to automatically boot into a Windows To Go workspace (if one is present) without needing to enter the firmware settings or manually change the startup options.

#### Overview of Windows To Go Startup Options
Windows To Go Startup Options enable users to configure their computers to boot from a USB drive directly from within Windows, without entering the firmware. This feature is useful for portable work environments but comes with certain risks and considerations:

- **Security Risks**: A USB device containing malware could be booted inadvertently, compromising the system.
- **Boot Conflicts**: Multiple USB drives plugged in simultaneously can cause boot conflicts.
- **Default Configuration**: By default, Windows To Go Startup Options are disabled to mitigate these risks.
- **Administrator Privileges**: Configuring these options requires administrator privileges.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
pwlauncher {/enable | /disable}
```

#### Parameters
- **/enable**: Enables Windows To Go startup options, allowing the computer to automatically boot from a USB device if one is present.
- **/disable**: Disables Windows To Go startup options, preventing the computer from booting from a USB device unless configured manually in the firmware.
- **/?**: Displays help information at the command prompt.

#### Examples
- **To enable boot from USB**:
  ```plaintext
  pwlauncher /enable
  ```

- **To disable boot from USB**:
  ```plaintext
  pwlauncher /disable
  ```

By using the `pwlauncher` tool, administrators can manage the boot behavior of their systems to support or restrict USB-based Windows To Go workspaces as needed.
