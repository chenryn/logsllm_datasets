Table 8: Empirical probabilities for the 10 most popular passwords and the total probability mass of unique passwords in each
set. Probabilities that are not signiﬁcantly different from CMUactive for a given password rank are grayed out and marked with
a † (Bonferroni-corrected χ2 test, p < 0.05).
Figure 8: Password-composition characteristics, by password set, with 95% conﬁdence intervals. The conﬁdence interval for
CMUactive is shaded. By these metrics, MTsim is generally the closest match for CMUactive.
to genuine passwords, we discuss our procedure for analyzing those
passwords while respecting users’ privacy and security.
For researchers restricted to more traditional mechanisms of pass-
word collection — such as lab or online studies and subsetting from
leaked password data — we provide insight into similarities and
differences between those passwords sets and frequently used pass-
words protecting real-world, high-value accounts. Consistent with
previous work [30], we ﬁnd that subsetting passwords from those
created under one policy to approximate passwords created under
another policy is not an optimal solution to gathering good pass-
word data for analysis. While these passwords are sometimes sim-
ilar to the targeted passwords on some metrics, their high variance
makes them unreliable as proxies.
We ﬁnd that passwords created on MTurk are not a perfect sub-
stitute for high-value passwords either; the simulated passwords we
collected were slightly weaker than the genuine ones. However, the
simulated passwords do seem to be reasonably close in several re-
spects, including length and character composition. Further, when
used as training data for guessing genuine passwords, passwords
from MTurk were just as effective as genuine passwords. These
results indicate that passwords gathered from carefully controlled
experimental studies may be an acceptable approximation of real-
world, high-value passwords, while being much easier to collect.
