I was attempting to set up a blog using Pelican, and encountered the following errors when I ran the `make serve` command. After conducting some online research, it seems that this might be a web-related issue (an area I'm not very familiar with), and I haven't found a clear solution. Could someone provide some guidance? I am running Ubuntu with Python 2.7. Thank you in advance!

**Python Information:**
- Version: 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13) [GCC 4.8.2] on Linux

**Error Details:**

**Additional Note:**
I installed `pip` on my Ubuntu system, and after that, everything seemed to work. However, I am not certain if this resolved the issue or if it is related to a version compatibility problem.
