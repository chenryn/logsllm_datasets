# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Nowadays mobile computers are very common as the primary work device, multiple
monitor setups are also becoming more and more popular.  
Unfortunately the switching from the one laptop screen to the 2 or 3 screans
at work and than later to the other monitors at home is not a good user
experience as one than every time has to re arrange all the windows in the
proper order.
A tool that for every monitor configuration remembers where each window goes
and upon switching screens moves and resizes the windows accordingly would be
extremely useful.
Please add ;)
