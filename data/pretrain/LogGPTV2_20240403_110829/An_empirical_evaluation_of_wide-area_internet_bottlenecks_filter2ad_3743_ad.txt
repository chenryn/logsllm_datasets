### Analysis of Bottleneck Links in Network Paths

#### Probability of Bottleneck Link Types
The bars in the graphs represent the probability that an identified bottleneck link is of a particular type, based on our observations. For example, from Figure 3(a), we see that for paths to tier-2 networks, the bottleneck links are:
- Inside tier-1 ISPs: 7% of the time
- Inside tier-2 ISPs: 11% of the time
- Inside tier-3 ISPs: 3% of the time
- Inside tier-4 ISPs: 0.2% of the time

From Figure 4(a), we observe that various types of peering links account for bottlenecks in tier-2 paths approximately 15% of the time, with tier-1 to tier-2 links being the most likely among all types of peering bottleneck links. Together, these two graphs indicate that about 36% of tier-2 paths we measured had identifiable bottlenecks, while the remaining 64% had bottlenecks with available capacity greater than 50 Mbps.

#### Distribution of Bottleneck Links
Figures 3(c) and 4(c) show the breakdown of links averaged across each type of path for intra-ISP and peering links, respectively. The heights of the bars provide an indication of the prevalence of the corresponding type of bottleneck link relative to its overall appearance in the paths. For instance, Figure 3(c) shows that tier-3 links make up 17% of the bottlenecks to tier-1 destinations but account for only about 2% of the links in these paths.

Upon further examination, we discovered that some PlanetLab sites were connected to the Internet via tier-3 ISPs, and a few of these ISPs were bottlenecks for many of the paths leaving the associated PlanetLab site. More generally, lower-tier intra-ISP links appear to be bottlenecks more frequently than expected based on their presence in the paths.

A similar analysis of Figure 4(c) reveals that tier-1 to tier-1 peering links are bottlenecks less frequently than might be expected, given their proportion in the overall paths. Conversely, peering links to or from tier-2, tier-3, or tier-4 ISPs are bottlenecks more frequently than expected. For example, compare the proportion of tier-2 to tier-4 peering bottlenecks with the proportion of these links in the corresponding overall path length (e.g., 17% vs. 2% for paths to tier-1, and 17% vs. 4% for paths to tier-2).

#### Path Length and Bottleneck Location
Combining Figures 3(a) and 4(a), we can observe additional properties of bottleneck links. For example, total path lengths are around 8–9 hops, of which only 1–1.5 hops are links between different ISPs. However, bottlenecks for these paths seem to be equally split between intra-ISP links and peering links. This suggests that if there is a bottleneck link on a path, it is equally likely to be either in the interior of an ISP or between ISPs. Given that the number of peering links traversed is much smaller, the likelihood that the bottleneck is at one of the peering links is higher.

#### Bandwidth Characterization of Bottlenecks
In the previous section, we described the location and relative prevalence of observed bottleneck links without detailing their nature. Here, we analyze the available bandwidth at these bottlenecks, as identified using BFind.

The graphs in Figure 5 illustrate the distribution of available bandwidth of bottleneck links observed in different parts of the network. Each graph has several curves corresponding to different types of intra-ISP and peering links. Note that the CDFs do not go to 100% because many of the paths we traversed had more than 50 Mbps of available bandwidth. Recall that BFind is limited to measuring bottlenecks of at most 50 Mbps due to first-hop network limitations.

- **Figure 5(a)**: Shows the bottleneck speeds on intra-ISP links. Tier-1 and tier-3 ISP links have a clear advantage in terms of bottleneck bandwidth over tier-2 ISP bottlenecks. Surprisingly, tier-3 bottlenecks offer higher available capacity than tier-2 bottlenecks. Tier-4 ISP links exhibit the most limited available bandwidth distribution.
- **Figures 5(b) and (c)**: Show the distribution of bottleneck bandwidth on peering links. Tier-1 to tier-1 peering links are the least constrained, indicating better provisioning compared to links between lower-tier networks. Surprisingly, tier-2 and tier-3 links exhibit very similar characteristics in their peering links to tier-1 networks. Peering links between tier-2 and tier-3 are not significantly different from tier-2 to tier-2 links.

#### Latency Characterization of Bottlenecks
In this section, we analyze the latency of bottlenecks, particularly exploring the correlation between high-latency links and their relative likelihood of being bottlenecks. Figure 6 is similar to Figures 3 and 4, but instead of classifying links by their location, we separate them into latency classes (and whether they are peering or intra-ISP links). Low latency links have a measured latency, \(\tau\), of \(\tau < 5\) ms, medium latency links have \(\tau \leq 15\) ms, and high latency links have \(\tau \geq 15\) ms.

- **Figure 6(b)**: Shows the overall latency characteristics of the paths. For example, paths to tier-2 destinations have an average of 5.3 low-latency intra-ISP, 1.4 low-latency peering, 0.6 medium-latency intra-ISP, 0.1 medium-latency peering, 1.2 high-latency intra-ISP, and 0.4 high-latency peering links.
- **Figure 6(c)**: Illustrates the prevalence of bottlenecks according to their latency. High-latency peering links are much more likely to be bottlenecks than their appearance in the paths would indicate. For example, in observed paths to tier-2 destinations, these links are 18.5% of all bottlenecks but account for only 4% of the links.

This suggests that whenever a high-latency peering link is present, it is more likely to be a bottleneck.
