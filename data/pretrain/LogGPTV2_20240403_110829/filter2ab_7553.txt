### Title: BlackHat Asia-20: Expanding Threats on the Wi-Fi Attack Surface

**Abstract:**

Wi-Fi technology is a critical component of modern infrastructure, supporting a wide array of devices such as smartphones, laptops, IoT devices, vehicles, and smart city infrastructures. Consequently, Wi-Fi has become one of the most popular attack surfaces in contemporary information systems.

In this presentation, we will focus on the vulnerabilities present in Wi-Fi drivers before password authentication and the security issues that arise from these vulnerabilities. We will share our experience in identifying memory corruption vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi drivers and how we have automated the process of discovering these vulnerabilities.

Memory corruption bugs in Wi-Fi drivers can lead to immediate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and significantly impact the target system. Our research has revealed that these vulnerabilities often follow specific patterns. Based on these patterns, we developed a fuzzing tool that automatically identifies memory corruption bugs. This tool has successfully uncovered numerous vulnerabilities in widely used Wi-Fi adapter drivers, including those from Realtek (USB/PCI-E), Google Pixel 3, and Intel (PCI-E). Notably, all these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without the need for password authentication.

We are confident in the effectiveness of our fuzzing methodology and tool, and we look forward to presenting our findings at BlackHat Asia-20.
