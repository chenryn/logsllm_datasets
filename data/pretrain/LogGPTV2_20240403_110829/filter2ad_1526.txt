ABSTRACT
The 13th ACM SIGSAC Workshop on Programming Languages and
Analysis for Security (PLAS 2018) is co-located with the 25th ACM
Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS
2018). Over its now more than ten-year history, PLAS has provided
a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas
about programming language and program analysis techniques
with the goal of improving the security of software systems. PLAS
aims to provide a forum for exploring and evaluating ideas on
using programming language and program analysis techniques to
improve the security of software systems. Strongly encouraged are
proposals of new, speculative ideas, evaluations of new or known
techniques in practical settings, and discussions of emerging threats
and important problems.

1 INTRODUCTION
PLAS aims to provide a forum for exploring and evaluating ideas
on the use of programming language and program analysis tech-
niques to improve the security of software systems. Strongly en-
couraged are proposals of new, speculative ideas, evaluations of
new or known techniques in practical settings, and discussions of
emerging threats and important problems. We are especially inter-
ested in position papers that are radical, forward-looking, and likely
to lead to lively and insightful discussions that will influence future
research that lies at the intersection of programming languages and
security.

• Compiler-based security mechanisms (e.g. security type sys-
tems) or runtime-based security mechanisms (e.g. inline ref-
erence monitors)
• Program analysis techniques for discovering security vul-
• Automated introduction and/or verification of security en-
• Language-based verification of security properties in soft-
• Specifying and enforcing security policies for information
• Model-driven approaches to security

techniques
3 WORKSHOP FORMAT
This year, PLAS received high quality submissions attesting the con-
tinued vitality of the community whose work sits at the intersection
of programming languages and security. PLAS 2018 welcomed the
submission of both long research papers as well as short papers pre-
senting preliminary or exploratory work aiming at generating lively
discussions at the workshop. PLAS 2018 attracted 10 submissions—
of which, 6 were short papers—from 8 countries (Belgium, Estonia,
France, Israel, Japan, Sweden, United Kingdom, USA), with authors
spanning both academia and industry.
PLAS 2018 is delighted to have two excellent invited talks:
• Network Verification: Successes, Challenges, and Opportu-
• Formal Verification of Differential Privacy, Marco Gaboardi

5 WORKSHOP ORGANISERS
Mário S. Alvim (PC co-chair) is an Assistant Professor in the
Computer Science Department at UFMG (Universidade Federal de
Minas Gerais), Brazil. Mário’s research focuses on the foundations of
computer security, contributing to the establishment of a rigorous
science of security. In his latest work he has been developing a
compositional approach for modeling systems and quantifying
their information-flow properties. In particular, Mário has been
interested in the challenges and subtleties of the formalization of
game-theoretic approaches to quantification of information flow,
in which the payoff of a game is information leakage. His research
has appeared in numerous major conferences in formal methods
and security (e.g., IEEE CSF, IEEE S&P, POST), and he has served
in the program committee of a number of these conferences (e.g.,
IEEE CSF, QEST, PoPETS/PETS).
Stéphanie Delaune (PC co-chair) is a Research Scientist at CNRS
since 2007. She spent about 10 years at ENS Cachan before joining
the EMSEC (Embedded System & Security) team at IRISA (Rennes,
France). Stéphanie’s research focuses on the formal analysis and
design of security protocols. She uses techniques issued from au-
tomated reasoning, rewriting, model-checking, and concurrency
theory to model and analyse cryptographic protocols. In February
2017, Stéphanie obtained an ERC Starting Grant whose purpose
is to develop foundations and practical tools to analyse modern
security protocols with the aim of applying these techniques to
secure the next generation of nomadic contactless devices. She par-
ticipated multiple times in the program committees of the major
conferences in formal methods and security (e.g. IEEE CSF, ACM
CCS, POST) and is currently the PC chair of the CSF conference for
2 years.
