## Abstract
Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a promising future Internet architecture. While in-network caching has been a focal point, its high costs have led to a lack of consensus on its utility. Simultaneously, end systems possess underutilized storage and bandwidth resources. To address this, we propose an End System Caching and Cooperation (ESCC) scheme for CCN. ESCC leverages client-side caching and P2P-like content sharing, enabling efficient content distribution without the need for in-network caching. Our experiments demonstrate that ESCC outperforms universal caching in terms of performance, simplicity, efficiency, robustness, and low overhead. ESCC could serve as a viable alternative to costly and unnecessary in-network caching.

## 1. Introduction
Content-Centric Networking (CCN) [1] is a proposed alternative to the current host-to-host communication paradigm. A key feature of CCN is in-network caching, where routers equipped with caches store named contents, reducing bandwidth consumption and content retrieval time. However, in-network caching introduces significant overhead, including content storage, lookup, and replacement operations, which can challenge the line-speed forwarding capabilities of routers.

Current studies [2] indicate that in-network caching may not be essential. Meanwhile, end systems often have spare storage and bandwidth resources that remain underutilized. To leverage these resources, we propose a simple end system caching and cooperation scheme called ESCC, designed to replace in-network caching. The main advantages of ESCC include:

- **Simplicity**: ESCC is incrementally deployable and does not require additional components.
- **Efficiency**: ESCC enables fast content retrieval from nearby neighbors through client cooperation.
- **Robustness**: ESCC is resilient to client failures and unavailable content due to CCN's adaptive forwarding [4].
- **Low Overhead**: ESCC does not need to advertise content availability, as the "advertising process" is managed through FIB updates.

## 2. Scheme Design
The core idea of ESCC is that each client caches content and shares it with neighboring clients. After a period, a requester can become a content provider. When data is transmitted back to the requester, nearby routers record the route trace in their FIBs. Subsequent requests can then be redirected to the former requester (now a content provider), enabling fast access to content within the client’s neighborhood.

### Example
Consider a scenario where Client 1 requests content named “/cinc.cn/ccn.jpg” from a server. The request traverses a path through Routers A, C, D, and E, reaching the server. The data message returns via the same path. As the data reaches Router C, a route trace for “/cinc.cn/ccn.jpg/chunk1” toward Router A is added to C’s FIB. Similarly, Router A adds a route trace toward Client 1 in its FIB.

Later, when Client 2 requests the same content, Router C redirects the request to Client 1 instead of the server. This redirection is based on the longest prefix match in the FIB, ensuring that the entry for “/cinc.cn/ccn.jpg/chunk1” has higher priority than “/cinc.cn/ccn.jpg”.

## 3. Algorithm
The algorithm for data message processing at each router is as follows (request message processing remains the same as in CCN):

```plaintext
/* r: current router; d: current data; pd: popularity of d; hr: hop count from r to client; Tp, Th: popularity/hop threshold */
1: FOR (each matched PIT entry)
2:     forward data d via corresponding face to user;
3:     delete the corresponding PIT entry;
4:     IF (pd > Tp)    /* Content selection */
5:         IF (hr < Th)    /* Router selection */
6:             record the route trace in FIB;
7:         END IF
8:     END IF
9: END FOR
```

To prevent FIB expansion, route traces are only added to FIBs of routers within a short distance from the requester, and only for popular content.

## 4. Evaluation
We conducted extensive simulation experiments using NDNSim, generating topologies with the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model [6]. We assumed the storage cost of in-network caching is five times that of client-side storage [7], and client requests followed a Zipf distribution with parameter \(0.7 < \alpha < 1.3\).

Experiments show that ESCC, which leaves route traces in routers two hops from clients, outperforms universal caching in terms of access delay, link traffic, and server load reduction (Figures 3-5). Therefore, ESCC is a suitable substitute for costly in-network caching.

## 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose ESCC, a lightweight method for content distribution in CCN through client caching and cooperation, eliminating the need for in-network caching. Experiments demonstrate that ESCC achieves better performance, simplicity, efficiency, robustness, and low overhead compared to universal caching. We argue that ESCC could be a viable alternative to costly and unnecessary in-network caching.
