The Modern Internet
The Price of Convenience
“…One  can  easily  remain  free  of  even  the  most  intense  political  oppression  simply  by  placing  one’s  faith  and  trust  in  
institutions of authority.”  
– Glenn Greenwald
“When  I  am  afraid,  I  put  my  trust  in  you.”  
– Psalm 56:3

A Brief History
From FTP to µTorrent
“The  increase  of  disorder  or  entropy  is  what  distinguishes  the  past  from  the  future,  giving  a  direction  to  time.”
– Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time
“Information  is  power.    But  like  all  power,  there  are  those  who  want  to  keep  it  for  themselves.”
– Aaron Swartz

File Sharing Problems
• Insecure
• Trust a 3rd party source
• Reveal your identity
• Legality issues
• Inflexible
• Available everywhere at all times?
• Force-sync content across all devices?
• What if I'm offline?
• Inconvenient
• Watch the show that I am paying for
• Ads are an antiquated revenue model

File Sharing Problems
• Unreliable
• Exclusive content and licensing disputes
• Network outages 
• Not enough seeds
• Expensive
• Dropbox
• The Cloud
• Netflix, Amazon Prime
• HBO Go
• Unfair
• Not all usage patterns are the same
• Acquisition vs. Aggregation
12
Hybrid Model
• Inadequacy Breeds Innovation
• Created a niche market for solutions
• VPN’s,  proxies,  firewalls
• Darknet, PeerBlock, Tor
• Local AP’s
• Cure the symptoms, not the problem
• Reinventing File Sharing
• Leverage the power of our Internet access
• Create a hybrid model
• The best of the Centralized and Decentralized models
• Secure, anonymous, free, everywhere

A Recipe for Change
From Lemons to Fruity Juice
“If  you  want  to  achieve  something,  you  build  the  basis  for  it.”
– Noam Chomsky
“The only  way  to  keep  a  secret  is  to  never  have  one.”
– Julian Assange

1) Authoritative Source
• Overview
• Primary repository of trusted data
• Give away the Authoritative Source…
• Give away the control of our sensitive data
• Data
• The foundation of file sharing
• First to be secured
• Last to be compromised
• The price of online data storage
• Should never leave our control
Saving Cyberspace means that we need to reclaim the Authoritative Source
15
1) Authoritative Source
• Including…
• The power  to  protect  what’s  ours
• The certainty that our data is protected
• The choice to respond to attacks
• The ability to remain anonymous
• The Solution
• Take responsibility
• Reclaim the Authoritative Source
• Do what companies continue to fail at
• Secure our data
Saving Cyberspace means that we need to reclaim the Authoritative Source
16
2) Stateless Authentication
• Overview
• What does it mean to authenticate?
• Stateful
• Data storage
• Antiquated and unnecessary
• Rely on trusted 3rd parties
• Stateless
• Form of shared secret authentication 
• Mutual coexistence by shared knowledge
• Shared secret is obvious to a very specific group
• No registration process or data storage
• Dynamic encryption algorithms can be used
• Benefits
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to redefine authentication

2) Stateless Authentication
• The Solution
• Redefine what it means to authenticate
• Create temporary trust
• Social network shared secrets
• No data is stored
• Loss of security becomes insignificant
• Transitory nature of stateless authentication
• Ability to quickly alter dynamic encryption scheme
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to redefine authentication

3) Modular Security
• Overview
• Based on Layered Security
• Division of authority and separation of duties
• Double-blind
• Inability to store complete secrets
• Existing Applications
• Tempting targets for takedown
• Too many single points of failure
• Reveal too much information
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to implement a modular approach to security

3) Modular Security
• Plausible Deniability
• Always assume somebody is listening
• It’s  better  to  be  paranoid  than  to  be  caught
• What  they  don’t  know  won’t  hurt  you
• They  can’t  audit  what  you  don’t  have
• The Solution
• Multiple modules of defense resist penetration
• Messages increase strength as they propagate
• Each  module  is…
• Isolated
• Autonomous
• Self-sufficient
• Resistant to attacks
Saving Cyberspace means that we will need to implement a modular approach to security
