What is wrong with security?
What is wrong with security?
• Good security says you shouldn’t make 
assumptions.
• Most security products make this same 
mistake.
• This should be called Voodoo security…
IDS/IPS
• They analyze traffic.
• They determine good traffic from bad traffic
– With signatures written based on a 
vulnerability.
– With samples of known bad traffic.
• They do clear cut detection of good from 
bad, they are incapable of determining intent 
of traffic.
What if?
• Pedestrians on the web were not unarmed…
• Every website got scanned for security 
vulnerabilities when an indiviaul surfer visits 
it…
• Every web surfer has a vulnerability scanner 
built-in to the browser…
Introducing…
• Barrier
• Barrier is a vulnerability scanner that is 
installed in a browser and automatically 
checks websites for common security 
vulnerabilities. 
• This is good for consumers, bad for security 
companies. 
– In order to be useful an IDS or IPS will have to 
determine the intent of the traffic now.
