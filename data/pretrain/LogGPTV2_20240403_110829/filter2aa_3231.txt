### The Flaws in Current Security Practices

**Assumptions in Security:**
- Good security practices advise against making assumptions.
- Unfortunately, many security products still fall into this trap, leading to what could be termed "Voodoo security."

**Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
- IDS/IPS solutions analyze network traffic to distinguish between good and bad traffic.
- They use:
  - **Signatures:** Based on known vulnerabilities.
  - **Samples of Known Bad Traffic:** To identify malicious activity.
- While these systems can clearly differentiate between good and bad traffic, they are unable to determine the intent behind the traffic.

**What If...?**
- What if web users were not defenseless?
- What if every website was automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities when a user visits it?
- What if every web browser had a built-in vulnerability scanner?

### Introducing Barrier

**Barrier: A Browser-Integrated Vulnerability Scanner**
- **Description:** Barrier is a vulnerability scanner that integrates directly into a web browser. It automatically checks websites for common security vulnerabilities.
- **Benefits:**
  - **For Consumers:** Enhanced security and peace of mind.
  - **For Security Companies:** Increased pressure to develop more sophisticated detection methods. Traditional IDS/IPS systems will need to evolve to determine the intent behind network traffic, not just its nature.
