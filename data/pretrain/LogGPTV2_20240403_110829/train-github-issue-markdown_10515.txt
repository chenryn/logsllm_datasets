Hello everyone,

I am encountering an issue where images are being misplaced when scrolling quickly through a GridView. I am currently using Glide within the `getView()` method as follows:

```java
Glide.with(context)
     .load(imageUrl)
     .asBitmap()
     .thumbnail(0.1f)
     .into(imageView);
```

Could anyone provide some guidance on how to resolve this problem?

Thank you.
