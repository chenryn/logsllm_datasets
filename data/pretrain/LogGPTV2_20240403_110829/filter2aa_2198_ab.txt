told by the Conspiracy that the Mega Conspiracy's systemswould then remove,or disable
access to,thematerial from computer servers theConspiracy controls. The Mega Conspiracy's
AbuseTooldidnotactually function as a DMCA compliance toolas the copyright owners were
led to believe.
23.
When a file is being uploaded to Megaupload.com. theConspiracy's automated
system calculates a unique identifier for thefile (called a "MD5 hash") that is generated using a
mathematical algorithm. If, after the MD5 hash calculation, the system determines that the
uploading file already existson a servercontrolled by the Mega Conspiracy, Megaupload.com
does notreproduce a second copy ofthefile onthat server. Instead, thesystem provides a new
andunique URL linkto thenewuserthatispointed to theoriginal file already present onthe
1Furthermore, the safe harbor requires that an eligible provider have an agent designated with
the U.S. Copyright Officeto receiveinfringement notices; despitehavingmillions of users in the
United States since at least thebeginning oftheConspiracy, the Conspiracy didnot designate
such an agent until October 15, 2009, years after Megaupload.comand many ofits associated
sites had been operating and the DMCA had gone into effect.

server. Ifthere is more than one URL linkto a file, then any attempt by the copyrightholder to
terminate access to the file usingthe AbuseToolor otherDMCAtakedownrequest will fail
because the additional access links will continue to be available.
24.
The infringing copy ofthe copyrighted work, therefore, remains on the
Conspiracy's systems (and accessible to at least onemember ofthepublic) as long as a single
link remains unknownto the copyrightholder. The Conspiracy's internal reference database
tracks the links thathavebeengenerated by the system, but duplicative links to infringing
materialsare neitherdisclosedto copyright holders,nor are they automaticallydeletedwhen a
copyright holder eitheruses the Abuse Tool ormakes a standard DMCA copyright infringement
takedownrequest. Duringthe course ofthe Conspiracy, the Mega Conspiracy has received
many millions ofrequests (through the Abuse Tool andotherwise) to remove infringing copies
of copyrighted works andyetthe Conspiracy has, at best,onlydeletedthe particular URLof
which the copyright holder complained, andpurposefully lefttheactual infringing copy ofthe
copyrighted work onthe Mega Conspiracy-controlled server andallowed access to the infringing
work to continue.
25.
In addition to copyrighted files, othertypesof illicitcontent have beenuploaded
onto the Megaupload.com servers,includingpornographyand terrorism propaganda videos.
Members of the Conspiracy haveindicated to eachotherthatthey canautomatically identify and
delete such materials on all oftheir servers by calculating MD5 hash values ofknown child
pornography orother illicit content, searching thesystem forthese values, andeliminating them;
in fact, suchfiles withmatching hashvalues havebeendeletedfromthe MegaConspiracy's

servers.
Members ofthe Mega Conspiracy have failed to implement a similar program to
actually delete or terminate access to copyright infringing content.
26.
On or about June 24, 2010, members ofthe Mega Conspiracy were informed,
pursuant to a criminal search warrant from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia, thatthirty-nineinfringingcopiesof copyrightedmotion pictures were presenton their
leased servers at Carpathia Hosting, a hosting company headquartered in the Eastern District of
Virginia. A member ofthe Mega Conspiracy informed several ofhis co-conspirators at that time
that he located the named files using internal searches oftheir systems. As ofNovember 18,
2011, more than a year later, thirty-six ofthe thirty-nine infringing motion pictures were still
being stored on the servers controlled by the Mega Conspiracy.
27.
At all times relevant to this Indictment, the defendants and other members ofthe
Mega Conspiracy knew that they did not have license, permission, authorization, or other
authority from owners ofhundreds ofthousands ofcopyrighted works to reproduce and
distributethose works,includingmakingthem availableover the Internet. Membersofthe Mega
Conspiracy are aware ofthe way that their sites are actually used by others; have themselves
used the systems to upload, as well as reproduce and distribute, infringing copies of copyrighted
content; and are aware that they have financially benefitted directly from the infringement of
copyrighted works that they are in a position to control.
