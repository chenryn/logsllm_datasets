### The Mega Conspiracy and Copyright Infringement

**23. File Upload and Identification Process:**
When a file is uploaded to Megaupload.com, the Conspiracy's automated system calculates a unique identifier, known as an MD5 hash, using a mathematical algorithm. If the system determines that the uploading file already exists on a server controlled by the Mega Conspiracy, it does not create a second copy of the file. Instead, it provides a new and unique URL link to the new user, which points to the original file already present on the server. Consequently, if there are multiple URL links to a single file, any attempt by the copyright holder to terminate access to the file using the Abuse Tool or other DMCA takedown requests will fail, as the additional access links will remain available.

**24. Persistent Infringing Content:**
The infringing copy of the copyrighted work remains on the Conspiracy's systems and accessible to at least one member of the public as long as a single link remains unknown to the copyright holder. The Conspiracy's internal reference database tracks the generated links but does not disclose duplicative links to copyright holders. These links are also not automatically deleted when a copyright holder uses the Abuse Tool or makes a standard DMCA copyright infringement takedown request. Throughout the Conspiracy, Megaupload has received millions of requests to remove infringing copies of copyrighted works. However, at best, the Conspiracy only deletes the specific URL complained about, while the actual infringing copy remains on the server, allowing continued access to the content.

**25. Illicit Content Management:**
In addition to copyrighted files, other types of illicit content, including pornography and terrorism propaganda videos, have been uploaded to the Megaupload.com servers. Members of the Conspiracy have indicated that they can automatically identify and delete such materials by calculating MD5 hash values of known child pornography or other illicit content and searching the system for these values. Files with matching hash values have indeed been deleted from the Mega Conspiracy's servers. However, a similar program to actually delete or terminate access to copyright-infringing content has not been implemented.

**26. Infringing Motion Pictures:**
On or about June 24, 2010, members of the Mega Conspiracy were informed, pursuant to a criminal search warrant from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, that thirty-nine infringing copies of copyrighted motion pictures were present on their leased servers at Carpathia Hosting. A member of the Mega Conspiracy located the named files using internal searches of their systems. As of November 18, 2011, more than a year later, thirty-six of the thirty-nine infringing motion pictures were still being stored on the servers controlled by the Mega Conspiracy.

**27. Knowledge of Infringement:**
At all times relevant to this Indictment, the defendants and other members of the Mega Conspiracy knew that they did not have the license, permission, authorization, or other authority from the owners of hundreds of thousands of copyrighted works to reproduce and distribute those works, including making them available over the Internet. They are aware of how their sites are used by others, have themselves used the systems to upload, reproduce, and distribute infringing copies of copyrighted content, and are aware that they have financially benefited directly from the infringement of copyrighted works that they are in a position to control.

**28. Additional Websites and Domains:**
In addition to Megaupload.com, Megavideo.com, and Megaclick.com, the other websites created and domains owned by the Mega Conspiracy include: Megaworld.com, Megalive.com, Megapix.com, Megacar.com, Megafund.com, Megakev.com, Megaking.com, Megahelp.com, Megagogo.com, Megamovie.com, Megaporn.com, Megabackup.com, Megapay.com, Megabox.com, and Megabest.com. Several of these additional sites have also hosted infringing copies of copyrighted works. The websites and services, as well as the domains themselves, have been facilitated and promoted by illicit proceeds from the operations of Megaupload.com, Megavideo.com, and Megaclick.com.

**29. Companies and Entities Facilitating the Mega Conspiracy:**
In addition to MEGAUPLOAD LIMITED, VESTOR LIMITED, Megamedia Limited, Megavideo Limited, Megarotic Limited, Megapix Limited, Kingdom International Ventures Limited, Netplus International Limited LLC, Basemax International Limited, and Mindpoint International Limited LLC, the following companies and entities have facilitated and promoted the Mega Conspiracy's operations: Kimvestor Limited, Trendax Limited, Monkey Limited, Kimpire Limited, A Limited, Nl Limited, RNK Media Company, Megapay Limited, Megamusic Limited, Finn Batato Kommunikation, Mega Services Europe Ltd., Megateam Limited, Megastuff Limited, Megacard Inc., Megasite Inc., Seventures Limited, SECtravel, and Bramos B.V.
