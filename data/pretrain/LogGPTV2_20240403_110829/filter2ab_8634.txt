**ATT&CK ID:** T1562.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Disable or Modify System Firewall

Adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls to bypass network usage restrictions. This can involve disabling the firewall entirely or adding, deleting, or modifying specific rules. The methods for achieving this vary depending on the operating system and can include:

- Using command-line interfaces
- Editing Windows Registry keys
- Modifying settings through the Windows Control Panel

These actions allow adversaries to open up network access that would otherwise be restricted, facilitating further malicious activities.
