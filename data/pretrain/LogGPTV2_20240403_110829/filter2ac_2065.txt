### Title: Black Hat US-20: Hacking Public Opinion

**Abstract:**

The proliferation of online disinformation has reached a critical point. From scammers promoting fake cures for COVID-19 to nation-states spreading pandemic conspiracies, and domestic ideologues coordinating to disseminate manipulative videos about presidential candidates, malicious actors are exploiting societal divisions through vulnerabilities in our information ecosystem. The deluge of conflicting messages is overwhelming individuals and manipulating communities, leaving social networks struggling to keep pace.

Information operations are not a new phenomenon; they have evolved alongside technology and media infrastructure. These operations are conducted within the constraints of the available information environment, with the rules dictated by the features and algorithms of social platforms. The most sophisticated actors, such as nation-states, leverage both social networks and network infiltration to influence, distract, and manipulate large populations.

This talk will provide an in-depth overview of the mechanics of modern information operations. By examining the tactics behind some of the most impactful recent campaigns, the speaker will highlight the similarities and differences between hacking the information environment and the types of intrusions typically addressed by cybersecurity professionals. The presentation will conclude with a forward-looking analysis of the 2020 elections and a call-to-action for the audience to apply their skills in the defense of democracy.
