### .SH Notes
The collective GNU C Library (glibc) community wisdom regarding `abday`, `day`, `week`, `first_weekday`, and `first_workday` states the following, as documented at [https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/locales](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/locales):

- The second item in the `week` list specifies the base for the `abday` and `day` lists.
- `first_weekday` specifies the offset of the first day-of-week in the `abday` and `day` lists.
- For compatibility reasons, all glibc locales should set the second `week` list item to `19971130` (Sunday) and base the `abday` and `day` lists accordingly. Additionally, `first_weekday` and `first_workday` should be set to `1` or `2`, depending on whether the week and work week start on Sunday or Monday for the locale.

### .TH CASIN 3 2021-03-22 "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"

### .SH NAME
- `casin`, `casinf`, `casinl`: Complex arc sine

### .SH SYNOPSIS
```c
#include <complex.h>

double complex casin(double complex z);
float complex casinf(float complex z);
long double complex casinl(long double complex z);

Link with -lm.
```

### .SH DESCRIPTION
These functions calculate the complex arc sine of `z`. If `y = casin(z)`, then `z = csin(y)`. The real part of `y` is chosen in the interval \([-π/2, π/2]\).

One has:
```c
casin(z) = -i clog(iz + csqrt(1 - z * z))
```

### .SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

### .TH SEM_UNLINK 3 2021-03-22 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"

### .SH NAME
- `sem_unlink`: Remove a named semaphore

### .SH SYNOPSIS
```c
#include <semaphore.h>

int sem_unlink(const char *name);

Link with -pthread.
```

### .SH DESCRIPTION
`sem_unlink()` removes the named semaphore referred to by `name`. The semaphore name is removed immediately, and the semaphore is destroyed once all other processes that have the semaphore open close it.

### .SH RETURN VALUE
On success, `sem_unlink()` returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and `errno` is set to indicate the error.

### .SH ERRORS
- **EACCES**: The caller does not have permission to unlink this semaphore.
- **ENAMETOOLONG**: The `name` was too long.
- **ENOENT**: There is no semaphore with the given `name`.

### .SH ATTRIBUTES

### .TH SIGPAUSE 3 2021-03-22 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"

### .SH NAME
- `sigpause`: Atomically release blocked signals and wait for interrupt

### .SH SYNOPSIS
```c
#include <signal.h>

int sigpause(int sigmask);  /* BSD (but see notes) */
int sigpause(int sig);      /* System V / Unix 95 */
```

### .SH DESCRIPTION
Do not use this function. Use `sigsuspend(2)` instead.

`sigpause()` is designed to wait for some signal. It changes the process's signal mask (set of blocked signals) and then waits for a signal to arrive. Upon arrival of a signal, the original signal mask is restored.

### .SH RETURN VALUE
If `sigpause()` returns, it was interrupted by a signal, and the return value is -1 with `errno` set to `EINTR`.

### .SH ATTRIBUTES
For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see `attributes(7)`.

| Interface     | Attribute | Value   |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| `sigpause()`  | Thread safety | MT-Safe |

### .SH CONFORMING TO
- The System V version of `sigpause()` is standardized in POSIX.1-2001.
- It is also specified in POSIX.1-2008, where it is marked obsolete.

### .SH NOTES
#### History
- The classical BSD version of this function appeared in 4.2BSD. It sets the process's signal mask to `sigmask`.
- Unix 95 standardized the incompatible System V version of this function, which removes only the specified signal `sig` from the process's signal mask.
- The unfortunate situation with two incompatible functions with the same name was solved by the `sigsuspend(2)` function, which takes a `sigset_t *` argument (instead of an `int`).

#### Linux Notes
- On Linux, this routine is a system call only on the SPARC (SPARC64) architecture.
- Glibc uses the BSD version if the `_bsd_source` feature test macro is defined and none of `_posix_source`, `_posix_c_source`, `_xopen_source`, `_gnu_source`, or `_svid_source` is defined. Otherwise, the System V version is used.
- Since glibc 2.19, only the System V version is exposed by `<signal.h>`; applications that formerly used the BSD `sigpause()` should be amended to use `sigsuspend(2)`.

### .TH SIN 3 2021-03-22 "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"

### .SH NAME
- `sin`, `sinf`, `sinl`: Sine function

### .SH SYNOPSIS
```c
#include <math.h>

double sin(double x);
float sinf(float x);
long double sinl(long double x);

Link with -lm.
```

### .SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return the sine of `x`, where `x` is given in radians.

### .SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the sine of `x`.

- If `x` is a NaN, a NaN is returned.
- If `x` is positive infinity or negative infinity, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

### .SH ERRORS
See `math_error(7)` for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred when calling these functions.

- **Domain error: `x` is an infinity**
  - `errno` is set to `EDOM` (but see Bugs).
  - An invalid floating-point exception (`FE_INVALID`) is raised.

### .SH ATTRIBUTES
For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see `attributes(7)`.

| Interface     | Attribute | Value   |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| `sin()`, `sinf()`, `sinl()` | Thread safety | MT-Safe |

### .SH CONFORMING TO
- C99
- POSIX.1-2001
- POSIX.1-2008

The variant returning `double` also conforms to SVR4, 4.3BSD, and C89.

### .SH BUGS
Before version 2.10, the glibc implementation did not set `errno` to `EDOM` when a domain error occurred.

### .SH SEE ALSO
- `acos(3)`
- `asin(3)`
- `atan(3)`
- `atan2(3)`
