Individuals also regularly buy and sell ICQ numbers and tools
Free Tools
• Many sites also provided access to free 
downloads
– Older bots and malware
– Password scanners
– FTP checkers
– ICQ tools
– Proxy checkers
– Articles
– Exploits
– Warez
Purchasing
• Individuals interested in purchasing products from a 
seller must contact them privately
– ICQ
– E-mail
– Private messages in forum
• Buyers place orders and pay for services
– E-gold
– Web money (WM)
– Western Union

Organization of Market Actors
• There is an organizational continuum of sellers in 
malware markets based on seller reputation
Rippers
Unverified Sellers       Verified Sellers
l----------------------------------l-------------------------------------l
• Some forums maintain white and black lists to 
indicate who is trustworthy
– Rippers Database is also an important resource
Market Forces in Malware Forums 
• Four market forces shape relationships and 
actions in malware markets 
– Quick turnaround
– Low prices
– Reliable products
– Customer service
Neutralizing Behavior
• Some sellers and writers made comments to negate 
their involvement in illegal activity
– “the bot is a means of testing its network to the object of 
vulnerabilities, but not the tool for the attacks and other 
incorrect actions. For its use for any illegal purposes the 
author does not bear responsibility.”
– “The programme was created for informational purposes 
and to check your own protection (security). The author is 
not liable.”
Discussion
• All manner of malware and information are being 
sold or made freely available
• Prices are generally low and the services available 
allow anyone to engage in computer crime and 
identity theft 
• These markets operate much like legitimate 
businesses 
• Malware writers and carders justify their actions 
much like other criminals
Complex Issues
• Law enforcement interdiction appears to have a small impact 
on the black market for malware
• May be difficult to attribute the creation of tools to any one 
individual or group
• The language barriers involved can obfuscate the content of 
forums
• A good deal of time, and skilled personnel are needed to 
monitor and analyze posts
• Transitory nature of forums and communications generally
