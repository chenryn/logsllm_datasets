Figure 10: (a) Ratio of internal to external edges over time. Network X users create more edges overall, and
are biased towards internal edges, weighting the average upward. (b) Ratio of new to external edges per day.
Both networks overwhelmingly prefer edges to new users, although they reach this point at diﬀerent rates.
(c) The average distance in hops between the two OSNs drops over time as more internal and external edges
are created. By day 50, the two networks are essentially one large, well connected whole.
users in the two networks is static, and hence the pool of
possible friends slowly drops over time as edges are created.
Edge Creation Over Time.
Next, we switch focus
to look at the characteristics of edges, rather than individ-
ual users. By looking at the relative amounts of internal,
external, and edges to new users that are created each day,
we can identify what types of connections are driving the
dynamic growth of the network after the merge.
Figure 9(c) shows the number of internal, external, and
new edges created per day. Initially, internal and external
edges are more numerous than edges to new users. However,
3 days after the merge new edges begin to outnumber exter-
nal edges, and by day 19 new edges out pace internal edges
as well. This result demonstrates that new users quickly be-
come the primary driver of edge creation, as opposed to new
edges between older, established users. This is not surpris-
ing: since the merged network is growing exponentially, the
number of new users eventually dwarfs the sizes of network
X and network Y , which remain static.
Note that this result does not conﬂict with the results
presented in Section 3. Section 3 examines the edge creation
patterns over the lifetime of all users in our data. In this
section, we are comparing the edge creation patterns of users
who existed before the merge to everyone who joined after.
Thus, the age “buckets” in this section are very course.
We now ask the question: are there diﬀerences between the
types of edges created by network X and network Y users?
Although Figure 9(c) demonstrates that internal edges al-
ways outnumber external edges, the reality of the situation
is more complicated when the edges are separated by OSN.
Figure 10(a) plots the ratio of internal to external edges
over time for network X and network Y .
Initially, users
on both OSNs favor creating internal edges (i.e.
the ra-
tio is >1). However, by day 16, the ratio for network Y
users starts to permanently favor external edges. The reason
for this strange result is that network X users create more
than twice as many edges than network Y users.
In our
dataset, network X users create 3.9 million internal edges,
while network Y users only create 1.5 million. However,
unlike internal edges, external edges aﬀect the statistics for
both groups. Thus, the number of external edges (2.2 mil-
lion total in our dataset) is driven by the more active user
base. Even though network X users create less external
edges than internal edges, the number is still proportionally
greater than the number of internal edges created between
network Y users. The “both” line in Figure 10(a) is always
>1 because network X users create more edges overall, which
pushes the average upwards.
Figure 10(b) plots the ratio of edges to new users versus
external edges over time for both networks. This plot reveals
that the inﬂection point where users switch from preferring
external edges to new edges is diﬀerent for the two OSNs.
The ratio becomes ≥1 for network X 5 days after the merge,
whereas network Y takes 32 days. Despite these diﬀerences,
both OSNs demonstrate the same overall trend for the ratio
to eventually tip heavily in favor of edges to new users.
182Distance Between the two networks.
Finally, we
examine the practical consequences of edge creation between
the two networks. Our goal is to answer the question: at
what point do the two networks become so interconnected
that they can no longer be considered separate graphs?
To answer this question, we calculate the distance,
in
hops, between users in each group. Intuitively, the distance
between the groups should decrease over time as 1) more
external edges are created, and 2) more internal edges in-
crease the connectivity of users with external edges. In our
experiments, we select 1,000 random users from each OSN
on each day after the merge and calculate the shortest path
from each of them to any user in the opposite OSN. Thus,
the lowest value possible in this experiment is 1, e.g. the
randomly selected user has an external edge directly to a
user in the opposite OSN. New users and edges to new users
are not considered in these tests.
Figure 10(c) shows that the average path length between
the two OSNs rapidly declines over time. Although average
path lengths for both OSNs initially start above 3 hops,
within 47 days average path lengths are <2. Path lengths
from network X to network Y are uniformly shorter, and by
the end of the experiment the average path length is <1.5.
The distance between networks X and Y rapidly ap-
proaches an asymptotic lower bound in Figure 10(c). Once
this bound is reached, it is apparent that the graphs can
become no closer. We conclude that by day 50, when both
lines begin to approach the lower bound, the two networks
can no longer be considered separate OSNs. These results
demonstrate how quickly the two disjoint OSNs can merge
into a single whole, even when edge creation is biased in
favor of internal edges (see Figure 10(a)).
5.3 Summary of Results
Our analysis produces several high-level conclusions:
• There were a large number of duplicate accounts be-
tween the two networks that become inactive immedi-
ately after the merge.
• Edges to new nodes quickly become the driving force
• Despite user’s preference against external edges, the
two networks very quickly merge into a single, well-
connected graph.
behind edge creation.
We also observe that the merge alters user’s edge creation
patterns for a short time (until equilibrium is restored):
• The total number of edges created per day increases,
driven by the sudden appearance of so many new users.
• Users’ preferences for internal/external edges changes
• Network X users are more active than network Y
users. Thus, the external edges created between net-
work X and network Y force network Y users to be-
come more active than they normally would be.
drastically in the days following the merge.
6. RELATED WORK
Dynamic OSN Measurement.
Several studies have
measured basic dynamic properties of graphs. [22] analyzed
four citation and patent graphs, and proposed the forest
ﬁre model to explain the observed graph densiﬁcation and
shrinking diameter. [21] studied details of dynamics in four
OSNs to conﬁrm preferential attachment and triangle clo-
sure features. Similar conclusions were reached by studies
on Flickr [26] and a social network aggregator [10]. [16] mea-
sured network temporal radius and found out that there is
a gelling point to distribution.
In addition, [2] measured
weighted dynamic graphs, [1] analyzed the growth of a Ko-
rean OSN, and [36] considered temporal user interactions
as graph edges instead of static friendship. Finally, [12, 18]
analyzed blogspace dynamics.
Some studies focused on analyzing social network dynam-
ics through explicitly deﬁned groups [4, 40, 14] or discon-
nected components [19, 25, 15].
[18] tried to identify blog
communities and detect bursts in diﬀerent temporal snap-
shots. [30] utilized the clique percolation method [8] to iden-
tify overlapping community dynamics in mobile and citation
graphs. Unlike these studies, our work focuses on the evolu-
tion of implicit communities in a densely connected, large-
scale social graph.
Dynamic Community Detection and Tracking Algo-
rithms.
There are two approaches to detecting and
tracking dynamic communities. One approach is to mini-
mize the self-deﬁned temporal cost of communities between
snapshots.
[35] proved that this problem is NP-hard and
then several works [35, 34, 23] proposed approximation al-
gorithms. However, these algorithms only scale to graphs
with thousands of nodes.
[32] and [17] propose dynamic
community detection algorithms that scale to graphs with
hundreds of thousands of nodes. The drawback of [32] is
that it cannot track individual community evolution.
The other approach is to match communities detected
by static community detection algorithms across temporal
[11] maps communities between snapshots if
snapshots.
their similarity is higher than a threshold.
[3, 33] tracks
communities between snapshots based on critical commu-
nity events. These algorithms do not consider any temporal
correlation when detecting communities between snapshots.
7. CONCLUSION
This work presents a detailed analysis of user dynamics
in a large Chinese online social network, using a dataset
that covers the creation of 19 million users and 199 million
edges over a 25-month period. More speciﬁcally, we focus on
analyzing edge dynamics at diﬀerent levels of scale, including
dynamics at the level of individual users, dynamics involving
the merge and split of communities, and dynamics involving
the merging of two independent online social networks.
Our analysis produced a number of interesting ﬁndings of
dynamics at diﬀerent scales. First, at the individual node
level, we found that the preferential attachment model grad-
ually weakens in impact as the network grows and matures.
In fact, edge creation in general becomes increasingly driven
by connections between existing nodes as the network ma-
tures, even as node growth keeps pace with the growth in
overall network size. Second, at the community level, we
use an incremental version of the popular Louvain commu-
nity detection algorithm to track communities across snap-
shots. We empirically analyze the birth, growth, and death
of communities across merge and split events, and show that
community merges can be predicted with reasonable accu-
racy using structural features and dynamic metrics such as
acceleration in community size. Finally, we analyze detailed
dynamics following a unique event merging two comparably-
183sized social networks, and observe that its impact, while sig-
niﬁcant in the short term, quickly fades with the constant
arrival of new nodes to the system.
While our results from this network may not generalize
to all social networks, our analysis provides a template for
understanding the dynamic processes that are active at dif-
ferent scales in many complex networks. A signiﬁcant take-
away from our work is that the actions of individual users
are not only driven by dynamic processes at the node-level,
but are also signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by events at the com-
munity and network levels. A comprehensive understanding
or model of an evolving network must account for changes
at the network and community levels and their impact on
individual users.
