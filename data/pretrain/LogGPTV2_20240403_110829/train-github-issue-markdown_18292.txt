### Expected Behavior
When the following code is exectuted:
    appWindow.on("restore", (event: any) => {
        console.log("AppWindow.restore");
    });
This should output AppWindow.restore in the editor terminal after running the
main file.
### Actual Behavior
When the following code is exectuted:
    appWindow.on("restore", (event: any) => {
        console.log("AppWindow.restore");
    });
Failed to do what is expected, but the same code and swapping restore for
maximized seems to work, and all the other events
