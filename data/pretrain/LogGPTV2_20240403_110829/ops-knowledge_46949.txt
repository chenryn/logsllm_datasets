User: How can a website avoid DDoS attacks?
Assistant: Here are some common measures how websites can avoid DDoS attacks: 1. Use DDoS defense services: Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and cloud service providers offer DDoS defense services that can provide additional protection for websites. 2. Update software and systems: Regularly update server software and operating systems to patch known vulnerabilities and weaknesses so that attackers cannot exploit them. 3. Use firewall: set firewall rules, you can restrict access to websites based on IP addresses and other specific parameters. 4. Using CDN service: By using content distribution network (CDN) service, this service will copy the content of the source server to servers in multiple geographical locations, provide users with faster access speed, and provide more bandwidth for the website and server capacity. 5. Limit concurrent connections: By limiting the number of concurrent connections initiated from a single IP address, you can prevent a malicious user from occupying all server resources. 6. Use an encrypted connection: Enabling an HTTPS encrypted connection can help protect a website from DDoS attacks and other cyberattacks, as HTTPS prevents attackers from stealing transmitted data.
