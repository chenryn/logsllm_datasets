Subject: Using Pylons as a Backend for a Flex 3 Application

Dear Doug,

I have experience working on a web application where the client-side user interface is built with Flex 3, and the server-side backend is powered by Pylons. In our setup, the client communicates with the backend via HTTP GET and POST requests, and all data is exchanged in JSON format.

Here are some insights and potential challenges we encountered:

1. **HTTP Method Limitations**: Flex applications cannot natively perform PUT and DELETE requests. To overcome this, we use POST requests and include an `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header to specify the intended method (e.g., PUT or DELETE). We then configure additional routes in Pylons to handle these requests appropriately.

2. **Custom HTTP Headers**: Flex applications can send custom HTTP headers, but they cannot read custom headers received from the server. This limitation is browser-specific; it works in Internet Explorer but not in Firefox and Chrome.

Overall, Pylons provides a simpler and more straightforward solution for web services compared to Twisted, especially for less complex applications. The combination of Flex 3 and Pylons has worked well for us, with only a few minor workarounds needed.

If you have any further questions or need more details, feel free to ask.

Best regards,
