### Conclusion

- **SELECT Statements Execution**: Ensure that your `SELECT` statements are properly executing with the necessary conditions, such as `WHERE xmin`.

- **Host Replication Configuration**:
  - Add the following line to the `pg_hba.conf` file on the master server to allow replication from the specified IP address:
    ```
    host replication replicator 192.168.0.28/32 md5
    ```
  - Copy the `postgresql.auto.conf` file to the slave's data directory:
    ```sh
    cp /tmp/slave/postgresql.auto.conf /path/to/slave/data/directory
    ```

- **Step 8: Start the Slave**
  - Start the PostgreSQL instance on the slave server:
    ```sh
    pg_ctl -D /tmp/slave start
    ```

- **Step 9: Check Replication Status**
  - Verify the replication status from the master server using the `pg_stat_replication` view:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;
    ```

### Failover to Slave/Standby

- **Streaming Replication Restrictions**:
  - PostgreSQL databases configured with Streaming Replication do not allow direct writes to their replicas or slaves.
  - To enable writes, a slave must be explicitly promoted.

- **Promote the Slave**:
  - Use the following command to promote the slave and allow it to accept writes:
    ```sh
    pg_ctl -D $PGDATA promote
    ```
  - The promotion process is quick and has minimal impact on existing connections to the slave.
