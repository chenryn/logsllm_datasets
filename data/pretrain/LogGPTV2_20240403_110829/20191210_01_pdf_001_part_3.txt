Conclusion
●Just like SELECT statements executing
WHERE xmin >>>> and >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
host replication replicator 192.168.0.28/32 md5
> /tmp/slave/postgresql.auto.conf
● Step 8: Start your Slave
$ pg_ctl -D /tmp/slave start
● Step 9: Check the replication status from Master using the view : pg_stat_replication
select * from pg_stat_replication;

Failover to Slave/Standby
● PostgreSQL databases do not allow any direct writes to be sent to their replicas/slaves, when
configured using Streaming Replication.
● Thus, a slave needs to be explicitly promoted in order to allow writes to it
● Run the following command to perform a failover
$ pg_ctl -D $PGDATA promote
● Promote happens real quick with almost no impact to the already existing connections on slave
