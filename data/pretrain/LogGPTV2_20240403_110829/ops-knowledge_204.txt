User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is a firewall enough of a security measure for an Ubuntu server that hosts a website? I recently got a VPS with Ubuntu on it, and I'd like to start creating a very basic website. However, I don't know what steps I should take to secure this server.

I'm new with Ubuntu, new with security and new with creating websites (the website will probably be just HTML, CSS, Django/Python and some database).

My biggest concern is that some hacker could try to use it as a zombie and I won't know. Or that robots could try to log in and sneak at whatever data I'll store on that machine and I won't know. Or who knows what else.

I found the firewall information page on the Ubuntu website, but will that be enough ?

P.S.: If it's impossible to give an answer, I'd also appreciate a book/website recommendation for Ubuntu and security complete beginners

Given the technologies you want to use you want to create a dynamic database-backed website without having any experience with this. This kind of setup is typical for easy too exploit sites: database-backed often allows SQL injection, insecure uploads might allow code execution etc. The normal packet filter firewall on Linux will not protect against any of these application-level attacks, i.e. a firewall is not enough of a security measure.

With the level of experience you currently have I strongly recommend to not create some dynamic application which is accessible (and potentially exploitable) by anybody. If this is just for your own or some selected users you might try to password protect the site using the established mechanism the web server has (i.e. htpasswd or similar) to at least limit the attack surface by limiting who can access your website.
