#### Straw Poll: What Is Threat Intelligence?
- Data feeds for purchase
- Big Data
- Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Output from a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system
- Tool outputs
- Executive reports
- Reporting from vendors
- Blogs and RSS feeds
- Critical information that, if ignored, could lead to negligence
- Too much noise, not enough signal
- The greatest thing since Hainanese Chicken Rice

#### Akamai CSIRT
**Customer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT):**
- Incident response for Akamai customers
- Focus on HTTP(s), DNS, and infrastructure
- Provides threat briefs
- Out of scope: Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), endpoints, email, and authentication

**Our Role:**
- Collect and provide information through OSINT
- Coordinate with peer CERT/SIRT/SOC
- Generate and share threat intelligence
- Engage in discussions with policy-makers
- Conduct customer outreach (internal and direct)

#### Qualities of Good Intelligence
- **Accuracy:** Reliable and factual
- **Timeliness:** Delivered in a timely manner
- **Relevance:** Pertinent to the user's needs

#### How the Intelligence World Does It
- **Intelligence Requirements:** Questions to be answered
- **Indicators:** Data points that can prove or disprove the questions
- **Coverage:** Methods to gather the required data points

#### Akamai CSIRT’s Intelligence Requirements
- Which customers need our help as incident responders?
- Which active or future campaigns target our customers?
- Have any customers been impacted by an attack?
- Are there any attacks that could spread to other targets?
- Are there additional measures we can take to protect our customers?
- Are there new tools that evade our controls?
- Are there temporary attack indicators we should look for during an event?
- Have we seen any new types of attacks?
- Are there activities associated with specific attacks that we should also monitor?

#### My Sources
- **Incident Response Activities:** Alerts and investigations
- **OSINT Tools:**
  - Scumblr
  - Site scraping
  - "Is it a customer?" tool
- **Email Lists**
- **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs):**
  - Financial Services
  - Communications
- **Big Data:**
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  - Firewall
- **Selective Data Feeds**

#### The Big Ugly Web Attack Tool Search
```
(xss | "cross site scripting" | csrf | xsrf | "cross site request forgery" | sqli | "sql injection" | "remote code execution" | RFI | "remote file include" | LFI | "local file include" | "command injection") (site:pastebin.com | site:gist.github.com)
```

#### OSINT Search for Impacts
```
site:google.com/newspapers (site|website|web) (hacktivist|hacked|ddos|defaced|"data breach") –"to death"
```

#### Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)
We started using the TLP to manage the sharing of sensitive information.

#### Two Views of Sharing Communities
- **Hub and Spoke:**
  - ISAOs
  - Regulators
  - Government-sponsored
  - Industry-specific
- **Peer to Peer:**
  - Event-centric
  - Less-developed
  - Cross-industry
  - Cross-discipline

#### How We Share Threat Intelligence
- **Sources:**
  - Official advisories and bulletins
  - Quarterly reports
  - Internal email lists
  - External community email lists
  - Corporate blog
  - “Hidden” in tools

#### Case Study: Login Abuses
- **Timeline:** Actively worked October 2012 to May 2013 and then again later
- **Impact:** 35+ customers initially affected
- **Actions:**
  - Created a TLP-Red advisory with all details
  - Internal release to security operators
  - Removed sensitive information to make it TLP-Green
  - Outreach to industries
  - Published on the corporate blog

#### Putting it All Together
- Start with what you know now
- Identify the questions to answer
- Use existing tools
- Ensure coverage that you can process
- Join or build a community with your peers
- Share what you can
