Akamai CSIRT’s Intelligence Requirements 
Which customers need our help as incident responders? 
• Which active or future campaigns target our customers? 
• Have any customers been impacted by an attack? 
• Are their any attacks that could spread to other targets? 
Are there any additional things that we can do to protect our 
customers? 
• Are there any new tools that evade our controls set? 
• Are there any attack indicators that we should be looking for temporarily 
during an event? 
• Have we seen any new types of attacks? 
• Are there activities associated with particular attacks that we should also look 
for?
