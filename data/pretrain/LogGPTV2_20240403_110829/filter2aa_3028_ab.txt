## Implementation
- **RDS Encoder:** We use a commercially available RDS encoder (approx. $40 USD), but it is feasible to build your own.
- **Communication Protocol:** i2c is used for communication with the chipset. We use a custom C application over the supplied client to send different Group Types.
- **Parameters:** All parameters (PI, PTY, etc.) and remaining data (last 3 RDS Blocks in Hexadecimal) are set.
- **Checkword:** Automatically computed by the chipset.
- **Source Code:** Available at [http://dev.inversepath.com/rds/i2c_minirds.tar.gz](http://dev.inversepath.com/rds/i2c_minirds.tar.gz)

### Example Code Snippet
```c
unsigned char PI_buf[PI_BUF] = { '\x52', '\x18' }; /* PI */
unsigned char PS_buf[PS_BUF] = { 'R', 'A', 'D', 'I', '0', '1', '0', '5' }; /* PS */
...
unsigned char UDG2_buf[UDG2_BUF] = {'\x35','\x30','\x00','\x66','\xCD','\x46'}; /* 3A */
unsigned char UDG1_buf[UDG1_BUF] = {'\x85','\x22','\xC8','\x6C','\x05','\x6F'}; /* 8A */
```

### Group B0
- **TP PTY D F DP:** 1 9 0 0 2
- **D PN Extent Event:** 1 1 1
- **Location:** 108
- **Event Code:** 1391
- **Description:** 8A Group - Varied Speech - Queueing Traffic

## Main Components
- **MiniRDS Encoder:** [http://www.pira.cz](http://www.pira.cz)
- **FM Transmitter**
- **PIC16F84**
- **SAA1057 (Digital PLL Tuning)**
- **Closed Dipole Antenna**

## FM Transmission
- **Tuning:** The FM transmitter can be tuned to arbitrary frequencies.
- **Stability:** A stable transmitter is crucial for data injection.
- **Range:** Long distances can be covered, but it may be desirable to limit the range to target specific areas.

## RDS-TMC Detection
- **Detection Method:** RDS-TMC is detected using 3A Sys Info groups, which specify the Location Table, service scope, and timing settings.
- **Hijacking Channels:**
  1. Find the frequency of a channel that provides RDS-TMC.
  2. Obscure the channel and send 8A packets (3A not necessary) when the SatNav locks on it (careful timing).
- **Fake FM Broadcast:**
  1. Find an unused frequency.
  2. Continuously transmit 3A groups + 8A packets.

## Stealth Techniques
- **Option 1:** Mix the audio component taken on the Alternate Frequency (AF) for the hijacked channel.
- **Option 2:** Fake a new channel on an unused frequency.

## Attack Scenarios
### Standard Traffic Messages
- **Events:**
  1. Queues
  2. Bad Weather (Rain, Smog, Fog, Fresh Snow, etc.)
  3. Full Car Parks
  4. Overcrowded Service Areas
  5. Accidents
  6. Roadworks
- **Example:** Code 108 - Queueing Traffic

### Closing Roads
- **Events:**
  1. Closed
  2. No through traffic
  3. Accidents
- **Impact:** The SatNav will prompt the user for a detour and avoid closed roads during route recalculation.
- **Example:** Code 401 - Closed

### Security Messages
- **Events:**
  1. Terrorist Incident (Code 1518)
  2. Air Raid, Danger (Code 1481)
  3. Air Crash (Code 978)
  4. Bomb Alert (Code 1516)
  5. Security Alert (Code 1571)
- **Impact:** Security messages can pop up if they affect the current route.

### Other Messages
- **Examples:**
  1. Bull Fight (Code 1456)
  2. Delays due to Parade (Code 1560)

## Implementation Issues
- **Honda Integrated SatNav:**
  - PI is not associated with the frequency.
  - Total cancellation (Event: 2047, Location: 65535) is not honored.
  - Broadcast message (Location: 65535) is not honored.
  - Diversion bit is ignored for some categories and always assumed to be 1.

## RDS-TMC Encryption
- **Support:** TMC supports lightweight encryption for commercial services as per ISO 14819-6.
- **Purpose:** Used for signal discrimination rather than authentication.
- **Encryption:** Only the Location Code is encrypted.
- **Key:** Can be trivially broken by sampling some data.
- **Compatibility:** Terminals that support encryption also accept unencrypted data, allowing injection.

## Security Considerations
- **Ease of Injection:** RDS-TMC can be easily injected.
- **Driver Awareness:** Drivers generally lack security awareness regarding their SatNav, making social engineering, forced detours, and panic attacks possible.
- **Authentication:** These systems should be authenticated considering their increased usage and expansion.
- **Patching:** Patching these technologies is challenging due to their long lifespan.

## TMC Forum Official Response
- **Statement:** "Hacking TMC â€“ Unsuccessfully" (...not really)
- **Legal Implications:** Such transmissions are illegal and contravene broadcasting legislation in Europe and the U.S.
- **Technical Barriers:** Random location codes and event codes may not cause the terminal to react.

## Future Developments
- **TMC over DAB and Satellite Radio:** Harder to inject but still possible.
- **TPEG (Transport Protocol Experts Group):** New standard designed to replace TMC, supports optional encryption.
- **GST (Global System for Telematics):** New architecture for delivering various services, backed by many manufacturers, supports PKI for billing and transport purposes.

## Similar Systems
- **Microsoft DirectBand:** Used for MSN Direct, offers larger bandwidth and full encryption.
- **Applications:** Special wristwatches and SatNav systems for traffic information.
- **Availability:** Not available in Europe, looks very promising.
