Switching between the different app bar display options in the "Contact
profile" study can cause the Flutter Gallery app to crash. I tested this on a
OnePlus3T using the production version on the PlayStore and locally using the
version in v0.5.1.
@HansMuller I think this is behind the error in #17598
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Open the "Contact profile" study
  2. Scroll the bottom of the page
  3. Select the drop down menu in top right of the app bar and choose the "App bar snaps" option
  4. Scroll up until the full app bar is displayed (screenshot attached)

  5. Select the "App bar floats" option
The app will not immediately crash but it is in a bad state and further
actions will cause various exceptions and crashes. Logs attached below.
