The `_optimize` API is great for improving performance of time series indices
or other cold indices, but the name of it is incredibly misleading.
Lucene changed from calling it `optimize` to `forceMerge` back in Lucene 3.5
(from this blast in the past, eh @s1monw!). Maybe it's time that we change it
too?
