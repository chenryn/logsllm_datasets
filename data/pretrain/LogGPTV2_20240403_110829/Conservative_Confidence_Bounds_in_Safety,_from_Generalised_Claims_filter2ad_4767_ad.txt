safer than the pfm for human drivers2. The risk of catastrophic
hardware failures implies that pl = 10−15. The AV company,
upon testing the AV in City-A for nA fatality-free miles, wants
to deploy in City-B. The company is conﬁdent (θ = 0.9)
that the AV performs no worse than ε in each city. And, they
have some conﬁdence φ that the road/weather conditions of B
are similar or more favourable, so this environmental change
should not harm safety. What conservative number of new
fatality-free miles nB need to be driven in B to claim – with
95% conﬁdence – that the AV is as safe as the average pfm
for human drivers, 10−8 (i.e. the claim [XB (cid:54) 10−8])? The
answer is presented in Fig. 7 as a function of nA.

free runs for A, required to achieve 95% conﬁdence in [XB (cid:54) 10−8].
In Fig. 7, stronger CII supporting evidence (i.e. increasing
φ) may reduce the required nB, or may not – depending on

for simplicity we round this to 10−8 in our example.
whether φ (cid:62) θ > 1 − θ (e.g. φ = 0.95 in prior Fig. 3b) or
θ (cid:62) φ > 1− θ (e.g. φ = 0.8 in the α → 1 limit of either prior
Fig. 4c or 4d). In fact, notice that the relevant formulae for both
Fig. 4c and 4d (see in table I) give
(2θ−1)L(ε, ε)+(1−θ)L(pl, p)
in the limit. This clearly does not depend on φ, which is why
the solid curve and dotted curve in 7 are identical.
(2θ−1)L(ε, ε)
How much increasing CII reduces nB depends on nA.
Starting from nA = 0, the more nA are observed, the fewer
the nB needed to support posterior conﬁdence in the claim –
nB may even reach zero. But eventually, as nA increases, nB
increases without bound. This is because the stated PK does
not exclude the possibility that B is very unreliable if A is very
reliable. In fact, with increasing nA the posterior probability
of the (xA, xB) point (pl, p) – an undesirable point from a
safety viewpoint – grows arbitrarily close to 1, requiring an
arbitrarily large nB to relocate probability to more desirable
points (e.g. to (ε, ε) below the [XB = p] horizontal line) and
improve posterior conﬁdence in the 10−8, XB bound. All of
the worst-case priors in Sec. V allow this effect (in line with
previous observations [6]).
VII. SENSITIVITY OF CONSERVATIVE CLAIMS TO
ALTERNATIVE FORMS/STRENGTHS OF EVIDENCE
This section highlights the change in conservative con-
ﬁdence claims,
in response to changes in the strength of
supporting dependability evidence and the PKs. A useful
reference scenario is the assessment of a single system (i.e.
proposition 1), where 95% posterior conﬁdence (in a claimed
pfd upper bound p) is supported by a PK 2 conﬁdence of
θ × 100%. In particular, if p = 10−8 and θ = 0.9, the most
conservative prior Fig. 1 implies that n = 7.55e7 failure-free
runs of this system are needed to support the claim [11].

Analysis 1. An analysis of the extent to which CII supporting
evidence can temper conservatism – in particular, reduce
the number of failure-free nB runs needed to support 95%
posterior conﬁdence in the claim [XB (cid:54) p] – compared with
if alternative evidence is used. We compare nB values related
to the following alternative CII formalisations and PK:
1) PK 1, 2, 3, ϕ = θφ, α = p, (prior Fig. 4d);
2) PK 1, 2, 3, ϕ = φ, α = 1, (prior Fig. 3b);
3) PK 1, 2, 4, φ, α = p, (prior Fig. 5b);
4) PK 1, 2, 3, ϕ = 0.95, α = p, (prior Fig.s 4a, 4b);
5) PK 1, 2 (for version A), 3, ϕ = φ, α = 1, (prior Fig.
3a).
Above, φ = 0.95, θ = 0.9 and p = 10−8. And, PK 2 applies
to both versions, except where explicitly stated otherwise.
version B is extremely unreliable when version A is extremely
reliable. None of the PK represent such contrary evidence.
Also, for small nA, the curves all lie above nB = 7.55e7
(Fig. 8). Thus, the nB each prior needs to support the claim
is more runs than is needed in the single system reference
scenario. This is despite being very conﬁdent that B is an
improvement (e.g. φ = 0.95). Because, after observing only
one successful run from A, all these priors have posterior
XB distributions that give less conﬁdence than the single
system prior of Fig. 1. Without evidence to the contrary, it is
conservative to believe version B is extremely reliable when
version A is extremely unreliable. Again, none of the PK
represent such contrary evidence.
Fig. 10: Weaker CII supporting evidence (φ = 0.91) gives weaker
conﬁdence c in claims (compared to Fig. 9), but to varying extents
depending on the form of CII.
Fig. 8: The forms of CII and PK, the strength of supporting evidence
(i.e. the values of θ, φ, ϕ), and nA evidence, all matter (to varying
degrees) in reducing the number of failure-free runs nB needed to
support 95% posterior conﬁdence in the claim [XB (cid:54) 10−8].
Fig. 9: Stronger forms of CII give greater conﬁdence c in claims.
Asymptotically, for large nA, all the priors require very
large nB to support [XB (cid:54) 10−8] (Fig. 8). Because, without
evidence to the contrary, it is conservative to believe that
Fig. 11: Stronger CII supporting evidence (φ = 0.97) gives stronger
conﬁdence c in claims (compared to Fig. 9), but to varying extents
depending on the form of CII.
Notice how there is a changing ordering of the priors,
in terms of how many nB runs they need to support the
claim. Initially, the prior with the strongest CII evidence in
PK 3 (i.e. ϕ = 0.95) requires the fewest nB (dotted curve),
while the prior with PK 2 satisﬁed by only the A version
requires the most nB (dash-space curve). Eventually however,
the prior with PK 4 evidence requires the fewest nB (dash-dot
curve). While the prior with the weakest PK 3 evidence (i.e.

ϕ = φθ) requires the most nB (solid curve) – here, statistical
independence (if true) gives a value for ϕ in terms of θ and φ.
Clearly, such statistical independence eventually leads to very
conservative nB requirements.
Fig. 9 is an alternative view for analysis 1. If nA = 7.55e7
– i.e. equal to the failure-free runs needed in the single system
scenario, to support 95% conﬁdence in a 10−8 pfd bound –
then some forms of CII give more conﬁdence than others. In
this sense the CII forms are ordered, from smallest to greatest
conﬁdence, as PK 3 (with α = 1), 4 and 3 (with α  ϕ (since φ  1010). Fig.
12 depicts what happens when nA = 7.55e9, i.e. 2 orders
of magnitude more than nA = 7.55e7 in Fig. 9. All of the
priors now give smaller posterior conﬁdence, their respective
curves lying everywhere lower than before. But this drop in
conﬁdence happens at different rates for the different priors.
Notice, the PK 4 prior now gives greater posterior conﬁdence
than a PK 3 prior (with ϕ = 0.95), where it did not before.
Contrastingly, for 107 < nA < 109, most of the priors
show less conservatism (i.e. smaller required nB) as nA
increases (Fig. 8). And, for some priors, there exist unique
nA values such that, with this failure-free “A” evidence, the

on whether PK 2 is satisﬁed by both versions, and on the CII form.

rather than, say, the reference nA = 7.55e7, then the largest

VIII. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION
A. Why CBI; risk of spurious optimism
Assessing system dependability may require integrating
diverse forms of evidence. For an assessor presented with
such evidence, Bayesian methods are a principled statistical
toolkit for dealing with uncertainty. However, they bring the
challenge of specifying a suitable prior distribution – one that
fully captures, and captures only, the assessor’s beliefs about
how reliable the system might be, as justiﬁed by evidence.
A prior may be wrong in that it fails to capture all of an
assessor’s beliefs. Or because it encodes additional beliefs not
actually held by the assessor. A wrong prior could, unbeknown
to the assessor, lead to dangerously optimistic assessments, or
unduly undermine conﬁdence in a good system.
In this paper we have made this task of specifying priors
in part, on
even harder by making claims for B depend,
evidence about A.
We addressed this problem via conservative Bayesian in-
ference (CBI). CBI’s advantages include: 1) it encourages
assessors to be minimalist, i.e., specify only those beliefs
which can be justiﬁed by the evidence; 2) it produces provably
conservative claims (no other prior distribution satisfying the
beliefs will yield more conservative claims); 3) CBI allows
its users to see how much unjustiﬁed conﬁdence would be
added by using an individual prior, among the priors allowed
by the PKs, instead of the worst case; 4) by spelling out
worst-case distributions compatible with the stated beliefs,
CBI highlights apparent inadequacies in the beliefs stated,
prompting assessors to review how well the stated beliefs
reﬂect the evidence.
The prior distributions of Fig.s 3, 4 and 5 each give the
least conﬁdence in an upper bound, p, on B’s pfd, depending
on various forms (and strengths) of reliability evidence. This
evidence includes: observed failure-free operation on sets of
nA and nB demands; evidence justifying CII probabilities
φ, ϕ of B being an improvement over A, or justifying the
probability θ of a version’s pfd being at least as good as the
engineering goal ε.
B. Selection of formal PKs and of parameter values
The formal probabilistic characterisations of CIIs that we
have introduced in the form of PKs 3 and 4 cover a set
of scenarios commonly found in practice. This substantially
broadens the set of scenarios we studied previously [6,7].
The forms of CII (and hence PKs) to use in a CBI safety
argument should be determined by careful consideration of
prior evidence (as we exempliﬁed in Sec. IV). Reasonable
values for ϕ or φ would normally be suggested by prudent
use of historical evidence about similar systems.
How to translate available prior evidence into formal PKs
will not always be obvious. In some cases, evidence may
seem to support more than one form of PK. Comparing and
contrasting their implications may then be useful, revealing
gaps in one’s understanding of what the evidence implies.
This exploration can be helped by the fact that sometimes
parameter values related to one form of CII can be derived
from parameter values for another CII form. E.g., if evidence
justiﬁes a probability of A satisfying the required pfd bound,
