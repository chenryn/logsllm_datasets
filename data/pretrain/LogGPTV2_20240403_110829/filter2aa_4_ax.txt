About the Author
When my 7‐year‐old introduced me to his second‐grade class, he put it best: “My mom teaches the good guys how to keep the bad guys out of their computers. She has a blue light saber.”
I have been in the technology industry for more than 20 years in a variety of positions from marketing to training to web development to hardware. I have worked in academia as an IT director of a private elementary/middle school and as a technology instructor teaching post‐graduate classes at Louisiana State University. I have trained and consulted in the corporate world for Fortune 50 companies and have hands‐on experience working and training the U.S. Department of Defense, focusing on advanced cybersecurity and certifications. Currently, I am Lead Education Technical Specialist at Rapid7, managing the curriculum and teaching classes in Nexpose, InsightVM, Metasploit, Ruby, SQL, and API.
I love what I do—as an author, a trainer, and an engineer—making the world safer one domain at a time.
