4.2 Design Methodology
Following common Knowledge Engineering best practices [14], we aimed at cre-
ating a modular solution based on well-designed, widely adopted vocabularies
that did not introduce substantial ontologicalcommitments away from the core
topics of interest. Thus, considerable effort was devoted to identifying and eval-
uating reusable ontologies.
First, we identified the main topics to be covered given the original USDL
specificationanddeterminedsomecoretermscharacterisingeachofthesetopics.
Informed by the topics and terms identified, we carried out both a manual and
semi-automatedsearchtodeterminepotentiallyrelevantreusableontologies.On
theonehand,weperformedastateoftheartanalysistoidentifyontologiesthat
were relevant for the modelling of services, see [11] and Section 2. On the other
hand, we used Swoogle [15], Watson [16], LOD Stats [17], and the Linked Open
Vocabularies (LOV)3 engines to search for ontologies covering the main terms
identified.Foreachofthequeriesasked,wekeptthetop10results.Theresulting
list was eventually enriched with widely-used general purpose vocabulariessuch
as Dublin Core (DC) and Simple Knowledge OrganisationScheme (SKOS).
Second, for each of the vocabularies identified, we used both LOD Stats and
LOV to figure out the number of datasets using these terms, the number of
instances of the main concepts of interest present in datasets on the Web, and
the number of times the vocabularyis reusedelsewhere.The searchfor reusable
ontologies provided us pointers to existing vocabularies of potential interest to-
gether with indications regarding their use and popularity. Table 1 shows the
results obtained for the vocabularies for which there was at least one instance
found on the Web4. Indeed, the statistics should not be taken as an exact value
of the overall use of these vocabularies (e.g., GR is used more frequently than
whatis reflectedby this analysis),but rather asa relativeindication. Indeedwe
also took into account the properties defined by these vocabularieswhich are in
some cases (e.g., DC Terms) the main constructs reused.

abletogetherwithfurtherexamplesinGitHub5,buildsuponafamilyofcomple-
mentarynetworkedvocabulariesthatprovidegoodcoverageofnecessaryaspects
and are widely used on the Web for capturing their particular domains. In par-
ticular Linked USDL builds upon:
– DCTerms6tocovergeneralpurposemetadatasuchasthecreatorofacertain
description, its date of creation or modification, etc.
– SKOSprovidinglow-costsupportfor capturing knowledgeorganisationsys-
tems (e.g., classifications and thesauri) in RDF.
– Time Ontology (Time)7 for coveringbasic temporal relations. The ontology
allows us to capture temporal relationships such as before and during.
– vCard vocabulary8 a vCard 4 compatible vocabulary to support providing
location and contact information for people and organisations.
– Minimal Service Model9 (MSM) [18] to provide coverage for automated
service-based interactions including Remote Procedure Call solutions (e.g.,
WSDL services) and RESTful services.
– GR10 [9] to provide core coverage for services, business entities, offerings,
and products.

The vocabulary has been modelled mostly using RDF/RDFS constructs and
wehavelimitedtheinclusionofabstractfoundationalconcepts,soastoattaina
modelthatissimpleenoughforitsadoptiononline.Thereaderisreferredto[19]
for indications on how this model could be mapped to a foundational ontology.
As the core and initial module of a set of vocabularies for supporting service
trading online Linked USDL Core, see Figure 1, aims to cover four essential
aspects: offerings, services, the business entities involved in the delivery chain,
and the actual interaction points allowing consumers to contract or trigger the
benefits of contracted services.
Linked USDL extends GR which is nowadays the de-facto standard vocabu-
lary for publishing semantic descriptions for products. It is worth noting that
although services are accommodated within GR, their coverage is rather basic
at this stage. Extending GR enables linking services and products descriptions
which is particularly useful since many products are often sold in combination
with a service, e.g., a repair or replace service. Additionally, it alsoensures that
an initial alignment with the increasingly popular vocabulary Schema.org is in
place, for GR is already largely aligned to it.

The most important concepts provided by Linked USDL are:
Service is a refinement of gr:ProductOrService and subsumes all classes de-
scribing service types. Examples of subclasses of Service could be “internet
provisioning service” and “insurance service”. Instances of Service may de-
finei)prototypicalservicespartofaportfolio,e.g.,“BTunlimitedbroadband
service”,ascoveredbyServiceModel, ii)one-ofservicescustomtailoredfora
potential customer, or iii) actually contracted services, e.g., “your concrete
life insurance provided by AXA”, as coveredby gr:ServiceIndividual.
ServiceModel is a refinement of gr:ProductOrServiceModel which specifies
common characteristics (e.g., download speed) of a family of services. Ser-
viceModel thus defines families of Services sharing common characteristics,
e.g.,“BT unlimitedbroadband services sharethecharacteristicofsupporting
unlimited download”. An actual service instance shares the properties of its
service model. This is a feature that requires non-standard reasoning which
specific implementations should take care of.
ServiceIndividual is a subclassofgr:Individual andService. InstancesofSer-
viceIndividual are actual services that are creating value to a network of
business entities. For instance, “your concrete life insurance provided by
AXA” is a ServiceIndividual which is providing value to yourself and AXA.
ServiceOffering isasubclassofgr:Offering andrepresentsessentiallyofferings
byabusinessentityincluding atleastoneService.ServiceOffering mayhave
limited validity over geographical regions or time.
EntityInvolvement isintroducedinLinkedUSDLinordertoenablecapturing
service value networks. In a nutshell, Entity Involvement allows capturing
a ternary relationship expressing that a business entity, e.g., “AXA”, is in-
volved in a service, e.g., “basic life insurance” playing a business role, e.g.,
“provider”.LinkedUSDLprovidesareferenceSKOStaxonomyofbasicbusi-
ness roles that covers the most typical ones encountered such as regulator
and intermediary.
InteractionPoint linkservicestointeractionsthatmaybepossibleorrequired
between the members of a service value network and the service during its
life cycle. This allows answering questions such as “what is the sequence of
interactions I may expect if I want to make an insurance claim and what
communication channels are available to that end?”.
CommunicationChannel is the class of all different communication channels
thatbusinessentities coulduseforcommunication.LinkedUSDL coversthe
most widely used channels by means of 2 vocabularies: vCard (e.g., email,
phone), and MSM (e.g., Web services, and RESTful services). Communica-
tionchannelsareadditionallycharacterisedbytheirinteractiontype.Linked
USDLprovides2referenceSKOStaxonomiescoveringthemainmodes(e.g.,
automated) and the interaction space (e.g., on-site).
EntityInteraction links interaction points to business entities or types (e.g.,
provider), and the role they play within the interaction(e.g., initiator). En-
tityInteraction allowsexpressingthings like “tomake a claim, the consumer
should first contact the insurance provider and provide the policy number”.
LinkedUSDL 77
Classifications. Classifications or taxonomies of entities are most often used
when describing services to capture, for instance, service types, business entity
roles, e.g., “provider”, as well as interaction related issues, e.g., “manual vs
automated”. We also expect that classifications will be needed in forthcoming
modules addressing strategic issues or the internals of delivery chains.
This could be approached directly using subclassing which is directly sup-
portedby RDFS. However,the use of a hierarchyofclassesestablishes strictre-
lationships which may not adequately match existing organisationschemes. For
thisreason,inLinkedUSDLwehaveaccommodatedtheuseofSKOS,whichen-
ables capturing classification schemes and taxonomies. Indeed, this mechanism
does not preventusers fromproviding their owndomain-specific categorisations
throughsubsumptioniftheywishto.ThisapproachthusenrichesLinkedUSDL
with a powerful, yet flexible and extensible means for creating categorisations.
ThecurrentversionofLinkedUSDLincludesthreeSKOSschemeswithrefer-
ence categorisations for BusinessRoles, InteractionRoles, and InteractionTypes,
see Figure 1. These schemes have been, however, kept as separate modules so
that different schemes can be used if necessary.

5.1 Coverage Evaluation
Ontologies are often evaluated by comparing them to a gold standard ontol-
ogy[20].Inourcase,wehavedonesuchanevaluationbycomparingtheresulting
modeltoUSDL,themostcomprehensivemodelavailablefordescribingservices.
Doingsoallowsustogetaclearindicationoftheoverallcoverageofthedomain,
and to identify as well the main deviations from USDL.
A fundamental goal of this work is providing a conceptual model that would
be easy to grasp, populate, process, and ultimately be adopted for Web-scale
use. Thus, out of the 9 modules of USDL we have essentially deferred covering
thefollowingmodules:Service11, Legal,ServiceLevel,andPricing.Nonetheless,
for every module we have checked the coverage of the main concepts defined in
order to get an indication of both module-specific and the overall coverage of
Linked USDL. The results of this analysis are summarised in Table 2.
This analysis shows that thanks to integrating an reusing existing vocabu-
laries we have managed to cover the vast majority of USDL, by providing a
vocabulary consisting of 12 concepts and 3 complementary SKOS categorisa-
tions. In particular, from an original specification with 125 concepts we cover
74%, if we limit ourselves to the specific modules we targeted, and 60% overall,
which shall contribute towards reducing the overhead related to understanding
11 The Servicemodule covers theinternal details of a service which are often private.
