1 Introduction
Cyber security is prevalent with the inherent use of digital technology and devices
connectedtotheinternet.Therefore,increasingtheneedforindividualsandorganisations

The National Cybersecurity Strategy 2016–2020 [16], refers to cyber security as the
protection of information systems (hardware, software, and associated infrastructure),
thedataheldonthem,andtheservicestheyprovide,fromunauthorisedaccess,harm,
or misuse. This includes harm caused intentionally by the operator of the system, or
accidentally,becauseoffailuretofollowsecurityprocedures.
Crimesofthisnatureareanonymouswithnogeographicboundary,thereforeallow-
ing crimes tobe difficult topursue and punish the perpetrator. Crimefigures for Eng-
land and Wales pertaining to cybercrime estimated that the number of fraud incidents
increased by 15% to 3,863,000. The subcategory “bank and credit account fraud”

accounted for much of the volume increase in total fraud, rising by 17% from 2.3 to
2.7millionoffences,withariseofcomputermisuseoffencesinAprilandMay[34].
There are many different methods used to commit fraud, however the banks are
developingnewtechnologytocombatfraudwiththeuseofbehaviouralbiometrictools
that will allow them to stay one step ahead of a fraudster. This is only one area of
cybersecurity that is needed in today’s world especially with the Covid-19 pandemic
that has changed the lives of everyone within organisations, the general population,
schools,colleges,anduniversities.

The emphasis now is to educate school children to become the next generation
fightingthewaragainstcybercrimeanditspreventionascybersecurityisbecominga
crucial element in curricula at all education levels. The foundational knowledge upon
which the field of cyber security is being developed is fragmented and, as a result, it
can be difficult for both students and educators to map coherent paths of progression
through the subject [30]. The current trends for the use of a computer for personal,
professional use, provide a gateway for criminal intent by individuals who have the
ability to capture ‘digital details’ that are stored in more places than people realise,
therebymakingusersdelusionalwhenitcomestoprivacyandthewaythattheyuseand

project aims to identify gaps in the field of cybersecurity education and the provision
thatiscurrentlyavailableinWalescomparedtoEngland.
The difference between educating learners to be aware not just at GCSE, BTEC
