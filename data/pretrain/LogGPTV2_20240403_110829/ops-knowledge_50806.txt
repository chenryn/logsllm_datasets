User: How to use Cron on a Linux system to implement regular backups of applications?
Assistant: 1. Install Cron Cron is a scheduled task tool in Linux, and it has been installed on the Linux system by default under normal circumstances. If Cron is not installed in the system, you can use the following command to install it: ``` yum install cron ``` 2. Write a backup script Before backup, you need to write a backup script. Backup scripts are generally written in shell scripts, for example: ``` #!/bin/bash tar cvf /data/backup/$(date +%Y%m%d)_app.tar /usr/local/app ``` above The script compresses the /usr/local/app directory into a backup file and stores it in the /data/backup directory. The name format of the backup file is year-month-day_app.tar. 3. Set the scheduled task Use the crontab command to set the scheduled task, for example: ``` crontab -e ``` Then add the following content in the opened editing interface: ``` 0 3 * * * /bin/bash /data/backup_app .sh ``` The content above indicates that the backup script will be executed at 3 am every day, and the path of the backup script is /data/backup_app.sh. 4. Save settings After adding content in the editing interface, you can use the shortcut key Ctrl+X to exit the editing interface, and press the Y key to save the modified content. 5. View the scheduled tasks Use the following command to view the scheduled tasks that have been set: ``` crontab -l ``` This command will list all the scheduled tasks that have been set. At this point, the regular backup task of the application is completed.
