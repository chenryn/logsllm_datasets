User: I am trying to run a python script via cmd prompt on my work PC (Windows 7, Python 2.7). The script requires filepaths from different drives on my PC. I am correctly pulling all necessary filepaths and I press Enter to run the script but the script just hangs. The only thing that shows is a blinking underscore. I try to click the X to close the prompt but nothing happens. 
I am not able to Ctrl+C out of the program either. I open up Task Manager and I am not able to End Task (nothing happens) or End Process (cmd.exe doesn't even show up in this tab). I also tried Start-->Run-->taskkill /im cmd.exe but nothing happens. The rest of my team has no problem with Python 2.7. The only way to get out of the frozen cmd is to hold down the power button. I do not want to have to keep going through this process especially since this is during work.  I'm hoping someone will be able to help me out:

Any idea what's wrong with the version of Python I am using?
How am I able to kill cmd.exe so that I can continue normal work functions without having to hold down the power button and waiting 5-10 minutes to reboot my PC?
Assistant: The filepaths I was pulling files from were through ClearCase directories. It turned out that I simply had to reinstall ClearCase. There must have been some configuration issue that was causing the cmd to hang and thus forcing a hard reboot. It's good to point out that I am no longer experiencing this problem and that nothing was wrong with the python scripts.
