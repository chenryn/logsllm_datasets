A Proof of Theorem 2.1
Proof. In a doubly-stochastic matrix, each row and each column
contain non-negative values that add up to 1. The Birkhoff-von
Neumann theorem states that the 𝑛 × 𝑛 permutation matrices form
the vertices of the convex polytope containing the set of 𝑛 × 𝑛
doubly-stochastic matrices. We observe that T contains all doubly-
stochastic matrices scaled by 𝐻. From the Birkhoff-von Neumann
theorem, it follows that the vertices of the convex polytope con-
taining T is the set of traffic matrices in ˆT . It remains to show that
the minimum throughput across ˆT is always equal to that across
T .
To prove that min𝑇 ∈T 𝜃(𝑇) = min𝑇 ∈ ˆT 𝜃(𝑇), let 𝜃∗ = 𝜃(𝑇∗) be
the minimum of the LHS achieved at traffic matrix 𝑇∗ ∈ T . We
will show by contradiction that at least one permutation traffic
𝑇 ∈ ˆT leads to this 𝜃∗. Specifically, let 𝜃∗ = min𝑇 ∈ ˆT 𝜃(𝑇). Sup-
pose there is no such permutation traffic matrix. Let ˆ𝜃 > 𝜃∗ and
ˆ𝜃 = min𝑇 ∈ ˆT 𝜃(𝑇) be the minimum achieved by some permutation
traffic matrix in ˆT . Caratheodory’s theorem [5] implies that there
exists at most |K|2 + 1 permutation traffic matrices {𝑇𝑥} in ˆT such
that
𝑇∗ =
𝜆𝑥𝑇𝑥,
𝜆𝑥 = 1, and 𝜆𝑥 ∈ [0, 1] ∀𝑥 .
|K|2+1
𝑥=1
|K|2+1
𝑥=1
Given this, we can use a convex combination of permutation
traffic matrices {𝑇𝑥} and {𝜆𝑥} to construct traffic matrix 𝑇∗ and
a solution to the multi-commodity flow problem under 𝑇∗. The
throughput of this solution cannot be less than ˆ𝜃, since all permu-
tation traffic matrices have a throughput of at least ˆ𝜃. This leads
to a contradiction, because we have assumed that 𝜃∗  0 (satisfying (b)), so(cid:12)(cid:12)V𝑢

Then, we choose 𝑘𝑚 = ⌊(𝑊𝑚 + 1)/2⌋, which always exists because
𝑊𝑚 is monotonically decreasing and at the highest𝑊1 = |K|−1, the
chosen 𝑘1 = ⌊|K| /2⌋ is feasible. Therefore, in the 𝑘𝑚-th iteration,
empty (satisfying (a)), and 𝑣 is picked from V𝑚
𝑢 . Thus, at the end of
the iteration, there are 2𝑘𝑚 pairs and all of them have shortest path
𝑚. Further,
their number is at least 𝑊𝑚 because 2𝑘𝑚 = 2⌊(𝑊𝑚 + 1)/2⌋ ≥
𝑊𝑚.

Lemma 8.3. Given a uni-regular topology with total servers 𝑁 and
𝐻 servers per switches, a traffic matrix𝑇 constructed from Algorithm 1

where 𝑊𝑚 for 𝑚 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑑} is defined in Lemma 8.1 and 𝑑 is the
minimum diameter from Moore bound [39].
Proof. Since the traffic matrix 𝑇 constructed from Algorithm 1
is a permutation traffic matrix, it follows that

the traffic matrix 𝑇 , let V𝑚 be the set of switch pairs whose shortest
path lengths are at least 𝑚 hops. From the definition, we know that
V𝑑 ⊆ V𝑑−1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ V1, and V𝑚 \V𝑚+1 only contains switch pairs
with exactly 𝑚 hops for 𝑚 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑑 − 1}. It follows that
