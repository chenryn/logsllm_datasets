 **Migrated issue, originally created by Michael Bayer (@zzzeek)**
cx_oracle types that subclass _NativeUnicodeMixin but not _OracleUnicodeText
are essentially text types where convert_unicode=True/'force' is entirely non
functional. Even if the cx_oracle coerce_to_unicode flag is turned on, which
we no longer recommend, a CLOB will never return unicode. this needs to be
worked out so that the public flags at least do as expected.
