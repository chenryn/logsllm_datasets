User: I have a Django app, with a real-time chat using tornado, redis and WebSockets. Project is running on the ubuntu server. On my local server everything is working good, but doesn't work at all on production server. I get an error 

WebSocket connection to 'ws://mysite.com:8888/dialogs/' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
  privatemessages.js:232 
close dialog ws

I have tried to change nginx configuration, settings.py, tried to open the 8888 port, but still no result.
Assistant: Just needed to change the port... May be this will help somebody.
