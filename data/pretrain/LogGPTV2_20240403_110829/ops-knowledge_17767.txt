I have a Django application that includes a real-time chat feature, utilizing Tornado, Redis, and WebSockets. The project is deployed on an Ubuntu server. While the chat functionality works perfectly on my local development environment, it fails to operate on the production server. I encounter the following error:

```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://mysite.com:8888/dialogs/' failed: 
Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
  privatemessages.js:232 
close dialog ws
```

I have attempted to resolve the issue by modifying the Nginx configuration, adjusting `settings.py`, and ensuring that port 8888 is open. However, none of these actions resolved the problem.

**Solution:**
After further investigation, I discovered that changing the port number resolved the issue. This may be helpful for others facing similar problems.
