Assistant: When deploying a large-scale system, the following steps can be taken to ensure that applications on multiple servers can run smoothly and work together: 1. Design a reasonable architecture: In the system design stage, it is necessary to consider the relationship between multiple servers. The way of collaboration, and design a reasonable architecture to meet this demand. Usually distributed architecture, load balancing, caching and other technologies can be used to reduce the complexity and risk of the system. 2. Use a centralized configuration management tool: centrally store system configuration information in a configuration management tool, and periodically synchronize to all servers. This ensures configuration consistency between servers and reduces problems caused by configuration inconsistencies. 3. Use container technology: Use container technology, such as Docker, to package applications into images and deploy them on multiple servers. This can reduce the complexity of deployment and ensure that the running environment of the application on different servers is consistent. 4. Automated deployment: Using automated deployment tools, such as Ansible, Saltstack, etc., applications and related configuration files can be automatically deployed on multiple servers. This saves labor costs and ensures consistent and repeatable deployments. 5. Configure the monitoring and alarm system: When deploying applications on multiple servers, you need to pay attention to the monitoring and alarming of server resources. You can use monitoring tools, such as Zabbix, Nagios, etc., to monitor the running status of the server in real time and issue alarms in time. This avoids application anomalies caused by issues such as server failures.
