### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:10:38 to 18:10:43 on October 18, documents several recurring issues and attempts to resolve them. The key points are as follows:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is unable to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]`.
   - This failure occurs repeatedly, with each attempt failing after a specific duration (initially 340 seconds, increasing by one second in each subsequent attempt).
   - The system logs a warning for each failed attempt and indicates that it will retry shortly.

2. **Address Changes**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` detects an address change for the server `msra-sa-41` at port `9000` and `8030`.
   - The old address includes the IP `10.190.173.170`, while the new address uses the hostname `msra-sa-41` without the IP.
   - These address changes are logged as warnings.

3. **Connection Attempts to Resource Manager (RM)**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - Each connection attempt is logged with an `INFO` level, indicating that it is retrying the connection.
   - The retry policy is `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each retry.
   - The system logs an `ERROR` each time it fails to contact the RM, indicating a persistent issue in establishing the connection.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Lease Renewal Warnings**:
  - At 18:10:38, 18:10:39, 18:10:40, 18:10:41, 18:10:42, and 18:10:43, the `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease, with the duration of the failure increasing by one second each time.

- **Address Change Warnings**:
  - At 18:10:39, 18:10:40, 18:10:41, 18:10:42, and 18:10:43, the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` logs address changes for both ports `9000` and `8030`.

- **Connection Retry and Error Logs**:
  - At 18:10:38, 18:10:40, and 18:10:42, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs an `INFO` message about retrying the connection to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - Immediately following these `INFO` messages, at 18:10:38, 18:10:40, and 18:10:42, an `ERROR` is logged, indicating that the RM could not be contacted.

### Conclusion

The log indicates a series of recurring issues where the system is unable to renew a lease and establish a connection to the Resource Manager. The address changes and repeated failures suggest a potential network or configuration issue that needs to be addressed.
