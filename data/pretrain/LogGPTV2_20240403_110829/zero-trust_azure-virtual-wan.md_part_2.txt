When the "Private Traffic" routing policy is enabled, VNet traffic in and out of the Virtual WAN Hub, including inter-hub traffic, is forwarded to the next-hop Azure Firewall or NVA that was specified in the policy. Users with [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) privileges could override Virtual WAN route programming for spoke VNets and associate a custom [User Defined Route (UDR)](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#user-defined) to bypass the hub firewall. To prevent this vulnerability, [RBAC permissions](/azure/virtual-network/manage-route-table#permissions) to assign UDRs to spoke VNet subnets should be restricted to central network administrators and not delegated to the landing zone owners of the spoke VNets. To associate a UDR with a VNet or subnet, a user must have the **Network Contributor** role or a custom role with the "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/join/action" action or permission.
>[!Note]
>In this article, Azure Firewall is primarily considered for both Internet traffic and private traffic control. For Internet traffic, a third party, supported security NVA can be used or a [third party Security as a Service (SECaaS) provider](/azure/firewall-manager/deploy-trusted-security-partner). For private traffic, third party supported security NVAs can be used as an alternative to Azure Firewall.

>[!Note]
>[Custom Route Tables](/azure/virtual-wan/scenario-isolate-vnets-custom) in Azure Virtual WAN can't be used in conjunction with Routing Intent and Policies and should not be considered as a security option.

## Step 4: Secure your spoke VNets
Each Azure Virtual WAN hub can have one or more VNets [connected](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal#vnet) with VNet peering. Based on the [landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) model in the Cloud Adoption Framework, every VNet contains a landing zone workload, applications, and services supporting an organization. Azure Virtual WAN manages the connection, the route propagation and association, and the outbound and inbound routing, but can't affect intra-VNet security. Zero Trust principles must be applied inside each spoke VNet according to the guidance published in [Apply Zero Trust principles to a spoke virtual network](azure-infrastructure-iaas.md) and other articles depending on the resource type, such as virtual machines and storage. Consider the following elements:
- **Micro-segmentation:** Even if Azure Virtual WAN attracts and filters outbound traffic, use of [network security groups (NSGs)](/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) and [application security groups (ASGs)](/azure/virtual-network/application-security-groups) to regulate intra-VNet flows is still recommended. 
- **Local DMZ:** A DNAT rule created in the central firewall inside the Azure Virtual WAN Hub should filter and allow inbound non-http or https traffic. Inbound http or https traffic should be managed by a local [Azure Application Gateway and associated Web Application Firewall](/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-application-gateway-waf).
   Although Azure Virtual WAN secure virtual hubs don't support [Azure DDoS Protection](/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview) yet, usage of DDoS to protect Internet-facing endpoints in spoke VNets is possible and highly recommended. For more information, see [Azure Firewall Manager known](/azure/firewall-manager/overview#known-issues) issues and [Hub virtual network and secured virtual hub comparison](/azure/firewall-manager/vhubs-and-vnets#comparison).
- **Advanced threat detection and protection:** See [Apply Zero Trust principles to a spoke virtual network](azure-infrastructure-iaas.md). The elements inside the spoke must be protected with threat protection tools like Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Because the hub in Azure Virtual WAN is locked and managed by Azure, custom components can't be installed or enabled there. Some resources that are normally deployed inside the hub, in a classic hub and spoke model, must be placed in one or more spokes that acts as shared resource networks. For example:
- **Azure Bastion:** [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/vnet-peering) supports Azure Virtual WAN but must be deployed inside a spoke virtual network because the hub is restricted and managed by Azure. From the Azure Bastion spoke, users can reach resources in other VNets, but requires [IP-based connection](/azure/bastion/connect-ip-address) available with the Azure Bastion Standard SKU. 
- **Custom DNS servers:** DNS server software can be installed on any virtual machine and act as DNS server for all the spokes in Azure Virtual WAN. The DNS server must be installed in a spoke VNet that serves all other spokes directly, or through DNS Proxy feature offered by the Azure Firewall that is integrated inside the Virtual WAN hub. 
- **Azure Private DNS Resolver:** Deployment of an [Azure Private DNS Resolver](/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview) is supported inside one of the spoke VNets connected to Virtual WAN hubs. Azure Firewall that is integrated inside the Virtual WAN hub can use this resource as a custom DNS when you enable the DNS Proxy feature. 
- **Private Endpoints:** This resource type [is compatible](/azure/virtual-wan/howto-private-link) with Virtual WAN but must be deployed inside a spoke VNet. This provides connectivity to any other virtual network or branch connected to the same Virtual WAN, if the integrated Azure Firewall allows the flow. Instructions on how to secure traffic to Private Endpoints using the Azure Firewall integrated inside a Virtual WAN hub can be found in [Secure traffic destined to private endpoints in Azure Virtual WAN](/azure/firewall-manager/private-link-inspection-secure-virtual-hub).
- **Azure Private DNS Zone (links):** This type of resource doesn't live inside a virtual network but must be [linked](/azure/dns/private-dns-virtual-network-links) to them to function correctly. Private DNS Zones can't be linked to Virtual WAN hubs. Instead, they should be connected to the spoke VNet containing custom DNS servers or an Azure Private DNS Resolver ([recommended](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances)) or directly to the spoke VNets that require the DNS records from that zone.
## Step 5: Review your encryption
Azure Virtual WAN provides some traffic encryption capabilities through its own gateways for traffic entering the Microsoft network. Whenever possible, encryption should be enabled, based on the gateway type. Consider the following default encryption behavior:
- Virtual WAN S2S VPN gateway provides encryption when using [IPsec/IKE](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal) (IKEv1 and IKEv2) VPN connection. 
- Virtual WAN P2S VPN gateway provides encryption when using [user VPN connection over OpenVPN or IPsec/IKE (IKEv2)](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal). 
- The Virtual WAN ExpressRoute gateway doesn't provide encryption, therefore the same considerations from standalone ExpressRoute apply.
  - Only for ExpressRoute circuits that are provisioned on top of [ExpressRoute Direct](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-erdirect-about), it's possible to leverage platform-provided [MACsec encryption](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-macsec) to secure the connections between your edge routers and Microsoft's edge routers.
  - Encryption could be established using an [IPsec/IKE VPN connection](/azure/virtual-wan/vpn-over-expressroute) from your on-premises network to Azure over the private peering of an Azure ExpressRoute circuit. Routing Intent and Policies now supports this configuration with additional configuration steps required, as explained in [Encrypted ExpressRoute](/azure/virtual-wan/how-to-routing-policies#encryptedER). 
- For third party [Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) devices and NVAs](/azure/virtual-wan/about-nva-hub) integrated into Virtual WAN hub, specific encryption capabilities must be verified and configured according to the vendor's documentation.
Once the traffic has entered the Azure network infrastructure through one of the gateways or an SD-WAN/NVA, there's no specific Virtual WAN service or capability that provides network encryption. If traffic between a hub and its virtual network and hub-to-hub is unencrypted, you must use application-level encryption if needed.
>[!Note]
>Virtual WAN spokes doesn't support VNet-to-VNet encryption using Azure VPN Gateway because a spoke is required to use Virtual WAN hub remote gateway.
>
## Step 6: Secure your P2S users
Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that brings many networking, security, and routing functionalities together to provide a single operational interface. From a user identity perspective, the only touch point with Virtual WAN is in the authentication method used to allow a [user P2S VPN](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal). Several [authentication methods](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal#p2sconfig) are available, but we recommend following general Zero Trust principles [Microsoft Entra authentication](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-point-to-site-azure-ad). With Microsoft Entra ID, you can require [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access](/azure/virtual-wan/openvpn-azure-ad-mfa) apply Zero Trust principles to client devices and user identities.
>[!Note]
>Microsoft Entra authentication is only available for gateways that use the OpenVPN protocol, which is supported only for OpenVPN protocol connections and requires the Azure VPN Client.
>
Azure Virtual WAN and Azure Firewall don't provide traffic routing and filtering based on user account or group names, but it's possible to [assign different groups of users different pools of IP addresses](/azure/virtual-wan/user-groups-about). You can then define rules on the integrated Azure Firewall to restrict users or groups based on their assigned P2S IP address pool.
If you divide your P2S users into different groups based on network access requirements, we recommend that you differentiate them at the network level and ensure that they can access only a subset of the internal network. You can create multiple IP address pools for Azure Virtual WAN. For more information, see [Configure user groups and IP address pools for P2S User VPNs](/azure/virtual-wan/user-groups-create).
## Step 7: Configure monitoring, auditing, and management
Azure Virtual WAN provides extensive monitoring and diagnostic capabilities with [Azure Monitor](/azure/virtual-wan/monitor-virtual-wan). Additional details and topology can be obtained using a focused, prebuilt, monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal named [Azure Monitor Insights for Virtual WAN](/azure/virtual-wan/azure-monitor-insights). These monitoring tools aren't security specific. The Azure Firewall deployed inside each Virtual WAN hub provides the integration point for Zero Trust and security monitoring. You must configure [Diagnostics and logging for Azure Firewall](/azure/virtual-wan/monitor-virtual-wan-reference#azure-firewall) the same as Azure Firewalls outside Virtual WAN.
Azure Firewall provides the following monitoring tools that you should use to ensure security and correct application of Zero Trust principles:
- [Azure Firewall Policy Analytics](/azure/firewall/policy-analytics) provide insights, centralized visibility, and control to Azure Firewall. Security does require that proper firewall rules are in place and effective to protect the internal infrastructure. The Azure Portal summarizes details about "Potential Malicious Sources" generated by firewall engine IDPS and Threat Intelligence features.
- [Azure Firewall Workbook](/azure/firewall/firewall-workbook) provides a flexible canvas for Azure Firewall data analysis. You can gain insights into Azure Firewall events, learn about your application, and network rules, and see statistics for firewall activities across URLs, ports, and addresses. We highly recommend that you periodically review check [IDPS Log Statistics](/azure/firewall/firewall-workbook#idps-log-statistics) and from the **Investigations** tab, check denied traffic, source and destination flows, and the Threat Intelligence report to review and optimize firewall rules.
Azure Firewall also integrates with [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) and [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sentinel/). We highly recommend that you correctly configure both tools and actively use them for Zero Trust in the following ways:
- With Microsoft Defender for Cloud [integration](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/azure-network-security-using-microsoft-defender-for-cloud/ba-p/2228222), you can visualize the all-up status of network infrastructure and network security in one place, including Azure Network Security across all VNets and Virtual Hubs spread across different regions in Azure. With a single glance, you can see the number of Azure Firewalls, firewall policies, and Azure regions where Azure Firewalls are deployed.
- A Microsoft Sentinel [solution](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/06/08/optimize-security-with-azure-firewall-solution-for-azure-sentinel/) for seamless Azure Firewall integration provides threat detection and prevention. Once deployed, the solution allows built-in customizable threat detection on top of Microsoft Sentinel. The solution also includes a [workbook, detections, hunting queries and playbooks](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-network-security-blog/new-detections-hunting-queries-and-response-automation-in-azure/ba-p/2688746).
