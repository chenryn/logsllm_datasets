Abstract
The higher complexity ofthe hardware and software
employed by modern computing systems, as well as
semiconductor technology scaling, are increasing the
likelihood of Silent Data Corruption (SDC). SDC
occurs when incorrect data is provided to the user,
e.g., written to the memory or I/O system, and no error
is triggered. Such events may have catastrophic
effects,
in the case of life critical applications, and
represent a significant cost penalty for businesses. The
purpose of this panel is to provide real examples of
silent corruption, and discuss solutions for avoiding it.

Scaling of semiconductor devices, as well as the
increased complexity of the integrated circuits, has led
to higher error rates due to transient and intermittent
faults. These faults may primarily occur as a result of

This presentation provides several examples of
SOC due to hardware transient and intermittent faults.
For instance, the impact of high energy neutrons and
electrostatic discharge is discussed.
High volume off the shelf integrated circuits,
in
general, and microprocessors,
in particular, rely on
error detection and correction circuitry, for avoiding
hardware induced SOC. Parity, ECC and CRe, for
instance, have become ubiquitous in today computing
the increased complexity of the
systems. However,
fault-tolerance mechanisms has led, sometimes, to new
error sources. These errors particularly manifest when
circuits operate in "comer cases", difficult to validate.
Examples of design bugs,

avoiding such bugs are discussed.

SDC - Enterprise Data Centre Customers'
Worst Nightmare

We define SOC as incorrect data being generated in
hardware at some point during execution, and data
being passed on to the software layer, without being
detected for a period of time, that could be damaging
to a customer (it might get detected eventually). Sun's
position is that SOC, as defined above, is a reality and
investment in design features to prevent or reduce SOC
is a necessity. However, there are two key factors to be
considered in determining how much to invest:
1) Global factors: The application space for which the
hardware is targeted - e.g. enterprise servers versus
game consoles, etc.

2) Local factors: The nature of the circuits,
logic,
microarchitecture which determines the probability of
silent data corruption - e.g., SRAM cell versus ANO
gate, arithmetic computation logic versus branch
prediction logic, etc.
SOC though often associated with soft errors from
cosmic particle hits, can also arise from other sources.
The different sources of SOC are: 1) soft errors
resulting from cosmic particle hits, 2) process/design
marginalities
specific
environmental conditions, 3) hard errors resulting from
latent defects due to aging in silicon, and 4) comer
case functional bugs that occur very rarely. We give
examples of how each type of source can cause SOC.

The presentation concludes with concrete examples of

environment, and present a challenge to the audience
to develop better mechanisms to reduce silent data

The potential occurrence of SOC on HPC platforms
and associated systems is of interest to LANL HPC
community. While SOC is presumed to be very rare,
because of the number of components in our HPC
platforms and the scale of the scientific calculations
performed on them,
is possible that scientists'
calculations occasionally are affected by SOC.

3) test systems operated under laboratory conditions in

temperature, voltage and frequency and the SOC rate
for one or more test systems. Anecdotal historical
