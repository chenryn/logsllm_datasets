Here  we  have  assumed  that,  when  the  assumption
underpinning  a  leg  is  false,  the  argument conservatively
reduces  to  a  single  leg,  i.e.  confidence  in  the  claim
depends  only  upon  the  leg  that  is  based  on  a  true
assumption.  The  bounding  value,  again,  conservatively
assumes  that  when  both  legs  are  based  on  false
assumptions the claim is certain to be false.
Assuming further that our beliefs about the arguments
are ‘symmetric’ in the following way (this can be thought
of,  informally,  as  a  kind  of  indifference  between  the
arguments),  and  extending  the  earlier  notation  for  the
single argument, we have:

where the last term is the improvement over the previous
case  of  r=p2.  If (cid:68)=0.1, p=0.1, and (cid:72)=0.5, our confidence
in the claim now becomes 89.55%
Remember that in this example the highest confidence
in the claim from a single argument is 90%, which occurs
when  we  are  certain  the  assumption  is  true  (the
uncertainty then  centres  entirely  upon  the  evidence,  i.e.
upon the value of (cid:68)(cid:12)(cid:17) Thus the use of two legs has almost
restored the confidence to the highest level possible, i.e.
almost completely eliminated the problem of assumption
doubt.  In  fact,  if  we  could  be  certain  that  the  two
arguments  were  not  both  false,  i.e. (cid:72)=1,  we  get  exactly
this  maximum  confidence  –  all  the  uncertainty  in  the
claim comes from the evidence.
The worst case in this example occurs when r=0.1 (i.e.
=p ):  there  is  then  no  benefit  from  the  two-legged
argument, and the confidence in the claim is exactly the
same as for a single argument, i.e. 81%.
It 
is  worth  briefly  considering  the  case  of
independence. That is, instead of the ‘mutually exclusive’
arguments used above, consider the case where

where it is conservatively assumed that confidence in the
claim G  based  on  two  valid  legs  is only as  great  as  that
based on one (i.e. 1-(cid:68)). As above, when (cid:68)(cid:32)(cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:3)p=0.1 the
two-legged argument raises confidence in the claim from
81% to 89.1%.
So  far  in  this  example  we  have  made  very
conservative  assumptions  that  ensure  we  can  never  do
better than a single ‘perfect’ argument leg, i.e. one where
the  assumption  is  known  to  be  true.  Then,  for  the
numerical  values  we  have  used  for  illustration,  interest
has centred upon how close the use of diversity can bring
us to this ‘perfect’ argument confidence level of 90% (=1-
(cid:68)). That is, we have been solely concerned with the doubt
in the claim that arises from our doubt in the assumptions,
rather than in the evidence.  A less conservative approach
(in  fact,  perhaps  unrealistically  optimistic)  would  be  to
assume that the truth of G is certain if it is supported by
two valid arguments. We could then, for example, ignore

the first term on the right of (8). In this case, the bound on
confidence  in  G  from  the  two-legged  argument  rises  to
97.2%,  which  exceeds  the  highest  confidence  we  could
ever get from a single argument.
Example 3
Consider now a ‘mixed’ two-legged argument in which
one leg is of the ‘logical certainty’ type (see B above), and
the other is statistical (see A). We shall conservatively take
the claim G to be the same as GA – since GB implies GA. In
