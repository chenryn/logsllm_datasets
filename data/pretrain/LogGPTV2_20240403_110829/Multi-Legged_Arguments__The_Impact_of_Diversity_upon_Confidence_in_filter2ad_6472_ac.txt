In this section, we assume that when the assumption supporting a leg is false, the argument conservatively reduces to a single leg. This means that the confidence in the claim depends only on the leg based on a true assumption. The bounding value, again, conservatively assumes that if both legs are based on false assumptions, the claim is certain to be false.

Furthermore, we assume that our beliefs about the arguments are symmetric, which can be informally thought of as a kind of indifference between the arguments. Extending the earlier notation for a single argument, we have:

\[
P(A_2 \text{ true} | A_1 \text{ true}) = p
\]
\[
P(A_2 \text{ false} | A_1 \text{ true}) = q_0
\]

It is straightforward to show that:

\[
P(G \text{ true} | E, A_1) \leq \alpha (1 - 2p) + (1 - \alpha \varepsilon) p^2
\]

where the last term represents the improvement over the previous case of \( r = p^2 \). For \(\varepsilon = 0.1\), \( p = 0.1 \), and \(\alpha = 0.5\), our confidence in the claim now becomes 89.55%.

In this example, the highest confidence in the claim from a single argument is 90%, which occurs when we are certain that the assumption is true (the uncertainty then centers entirely on the evidence, i.e., on the value of \(\varepsilon\)). Thus, using two legs has almost restored the confidence to the highest level possible, effectively eliminating the problem of assumption doubt. If we could be certain that the two arguments were not both false, i.e., \(\alpha = 1\), we would achieve exactly this maximum confidenceâ€”all the uncertainty in the claim would come from the evidence.

The worst-case scenario in this example occurs when \( r = 0.1 \) (i.e., \( r = p \)): there is no benefit from the two-legged argument, and the confidence in the claim remains the same as for a single argument, i.e., 81%.

### Independence Case

Let us briefly consider the case of independence. Instead of the 'mutually exclusive' arguments used above, we consider the case where:

\[
P(A_2 \text{ true} | A_1 \text{ true}) = p
\]
\[
P(A_2 \text{ false} | A_1 \text{ true}) = 1 - p
\]

Then:

\[
P(A_2 \text{ true} | A_1 \text{ true}) = p
\]
\[
P(G \text{ true} | E, A_1) = \alpha
\]

Thus:

\[
P(G \text{ true} | E, A_1, A_2) \leq \alpha (1 - 2p) + (1 - \alpha \varepsilon) p^2
\]

where it is conservatively assumed that the confidence in the claim \( G \) based on two valid legs is only as great as that based on one (i.e., \( 1 - \varepsilon \)). As above, when \(\varepsilon = 0.1\) and \( p = 0.1 \), the two-legged argument raises confidence in the claim from 81% to 89.1%.

### Conservative Assumptions

So far, we have made very conservative assumptions to ensure that we can never do better than a single 'perfect' argument leg, i.e., one where the assumption is known to be true. For the numerical values used for illustration, the interest has centered on how close the use of diversity can bring us to this 'perfect' argument confidence level of 90% (i.e., \( 1 - \varepsilon \)). We have been solely concerned with the doubt in the claim that arises from our doubt in the assumptions, rather than in the evidence.

A less conservative approach (perhaps unrealistically optimistic) would be to assume that the truth of \( G \) is certain if it is supported by two valid arguments. In this case, we could ignore the first term on the right of (8), and the bound on confidence in \( G \) from the two-legged argument rises to 97.2%, which exceeds the highest confidence we could ever get from a single argument.

### Example 3: Mixed Two-Legged Argument

Consider now a 'mixed' two-legged argument where one leg is of the 'logical certainty' type (see B above), and the other is statistical (see A). We will conservatively take the claim \( G \) to be the same as \( G_A \) since \( G_B \) implies \( G_A \). In this case, the probability can be expressed as:

\[
P(G \text{ true} | E, E, A, A)
\]

This mixed approach allows us to combine the strengths of both logical and statistical reasoning, potentially providing a more robust and reliable basis for the claim.
