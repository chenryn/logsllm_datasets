ABSTRACT 
Building  a 
requires  careful 
coordination  among  all  layers  in  the  system  from  hardware  to 
software.  Even  if  secure  by  itself,  a  higher  layer  protection 
mechanism  may  be  bypassed  if  lower  layer  software  or 
hardware  is  vulnerable.  Additionally,  hardware  complements 
software  through  its  efficiency,  tamper  resistance,  etc.  There 
have been significant efforts recently in hardware communities 
that  aim  to  leverage  hardware  strengths  to  secure  software 
layers, and also to secure hardware itself. This tutorial presents 
some  of  these  hardware-enhanced  security  techniques  to  the 
security community.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Current security research is largely oriented to top-down design 
where 
the 
network/application  layers,  are  first  studied  assuming  that  the 
lower  layers  are  secure,  even  when  they  are  not.  The  lower 
layers are studied only when new threats appear at those layers. 
Security has thus become, as the cliché goes, an arms race to the 
bottom.    There  are  many  examples  in  the  literature  of  lower-
layer  attacks  including  those  that  target  anti-virus  scanners, 
libraries, OS, hypervisors, and even code stored in non-volatile 
ROM. For every software mitigation strategy, vulnerabilities at 
the  same  level  or  in  the  software  layer  below  can  be  used  to 
attack and weaken the mitigation strategy.  
A  longer-term  solution  to  this  problem  is  to  push  security 
mechanisms down to the hardware, which is one component of 
the system that is typically immutable. The increasing number of 
on-chip transistors and multicore chips provide an opportunity to 
explore  hardware-enhanced  security  systems.  In  addition  to 
immutability  and  nonbypassability  offered  by  hardware,  there 
are four further additional advantages to implementing hardware 
security  mechanisms.  First,  hardware-supported

mechanisms  are  much  more  energy-efficient  than  software-
supported  mechanisms.  Given  current  energy-  and  power-
efficiency trends, hardware support may be essential for security 
techniques to gain traction in the real world. Second, hardware 
offers  unmatched  visibility  into  program  execution,  creating 
opportunities for novel ways to improve systems security. Third, 
small hardware modifications, amounting to few lines of code, 
offer  significant  protections  to  trillions  of  lines  of  software. 
Further, because of nature of hardware construction of security 
features it is much more feasible to provide useful measures of 
security for hardware-hardened schemes. 
In this context, there have been significant efforts recently that 
aim  to  secure  hardware  itself  and  also  leverage  strengths  of 
hardware  in  securing  software  layers.  For  example,  to  build  a 
more secure hardware foundation, researchers have investigated 
ways to protect against backdoors built into hardware (hardware 
Trojans) and timing channels through shared hardware resources 
such  as  caches.  To  complement  limitations  of  software  layers, 
researchers  have  also  proposed 
leverage  hardware 
architecture  to  provide  protection  against  physical  tampering, 
reduce the trusted software base and its attack surface. Similarly, 
at  a  lower  level,  noise  and  variations  in  hardware  have  been 
studied as sources for true random numbers and device-specific 
secrets. This tutorial will provide a peek into the emerging area 
of hardware-hardened security systems.  
2.  AGENDA 
We will discuss hardware trends and provide a very brief outline 
of research in  hardware security support. We will discuss how 
hardware  can  support  more  secure  software  environments  and 
cloud  computing  systems.  We  will  also  cover  state-of-the-art 
research  techniques  for  more  secure  hardware  construction, 
including  backdoor-free  hardware,  leak-free  hardware  and 
useful hardware primitives such as PUFs. We will close with a 
discussion on how hardware and security researchers can engage 
better. The tutorial will cover some of the following topics: 
to 
•  Hardware trends, overview of hardware security support  
•  Secure processor and multicore architectures 
•  Secure cloud computing  
•  Hardware backdoors and Trojans  
•  Hardware mitigation of cache side channels  
•  Physical Security Functions - PUFs, RNGs, etc.  
3.  Intended Audience 
The  tutorial  will  be  targeted  towards  security  researchers  and 
practitioners  with  some  basic  understanding  of  computer 
architecture.
