Question: "An iPhone user has configured Face ID for authentication. Under which conditions will Face ID augment its stored mathematical representation of the user's face based on the information provided?"
 "A": "Face ID will augment its data with the new mathematical representation after every successful match to continuously improve its accuracy."
 "B": "If Face ID fails to recognise the user's face but the subsequent passcode entry is immediate and the match quality is above a certain threshold, Face ID will augment its enrolled data with the new capture."
 "C": "Face ID updates its mathematical representation only when the user opts to reset Face ID, ensuring that the user's facial changes are comprehensively captured."
 "D": "Face ID captures and stores images during normal operation for future reference and comparison, enhancing the likelihood of a match."
Answer: B
