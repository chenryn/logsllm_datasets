• What about malware that directly affects humans?

• Ultrasound & infrasound: above/below human hearing threshold
• Traditionally 20Hz – 20kHz (Durrant & Lovrinic, 1995)
– This is a misconception: thresholds vary widely
– This talk: 
• High-frequency noise (HFN): 17 - 21kHz
• Low-frequency noise (LFN): 60 - 100Hz

Acoustics and harm
PwC
• Basing a definition on a lack of a property is problematic
– Duck & Leighton, 2018
• Perceptibility not a case of arbitrary cut-off points
• Mechanisms not fully understood (Koch, 2017)
• Significant variation in thresholds
– Leighton, 2018; Leventhall et al, 2003; van Wieringen & Glorieux, 2018
Imperceptibility

Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Acoustics and harm
PwC
• Depends on volume, background noise, previous exposure, etc
• Sound may be perceived as vibration (Leventhall et al, 2003)
– Or audible ‘subharmonics’ (Ashihara et al, 2006; Howard et al, 2005)
• Likelihood declines non-linearly (Muhlhans, 2017)
• For HFN, threshold increases with age 
– Macca et al, 2015; van Wierengen & Glorieux, 2018

Acoustics and harm
PwC
• Susceptibility differs (Leighton, 2016; Qibai & Shi, 2004)
• No reports of high frequencies causing hearing loss, but:
– Adverse effects on hearing (Duck & Leighton, 2018)
– Temporary threshold shifts (Acton and Carson, 1967)
– Reduction in hearing sensitivity in audible range (Chopra et al, 2016; Grzesik
& Pluta, 1986; Macca et al, 2015; Wilson et al, 2002)
– Neurasthenia, cardiac neurosis, hypotension, bradycardia, functional changes 
in CV and CNS (Smagowska & Pawlaczyk-Łuszczy´nska, 2013)
Adverse physiological effects - HFN

• Nausea, fatigue, headaches
– Duck & Leighton, 2018; Howard et al, 2005; Von Gierke & Nixon, 1992
• Tinnitus and ear pain (Chopra et al, 2016; Fletcher et al, 2018a)
• Irritation (Ueda et al, 2014)
• Somnolence, dizziness, palpitations, decreased concentration 
(Smagowska & Pawlaczyk-Łuszczy´nska, 2013)
Adverse psychological effects - HFN

• Temporary threshold shifts (Leventhall et al, 2003)
• Some correlation with:
– Heart ailments, chronic insomnia (Mirowska & Mroz, 2000)
– Elevated cortisol levels (Bengtsson, 2003)
Adverse physiological effects - LFN

• Annoyance (Pawlaczyk-łuszczy´nska et al, 2005; Persson & Rylander, 
1988; Storm, 2009) most common, but also:
– Headaches and palpitations (Møller & Lydolf, 2002)
– Deterioration in performance & productivity (Bengtsson, 2003; Benignus et al, 
1975; Kaczmarska & Łuczak, 2007)
– Lower levels of cooperation & agreeableness (Waye et al, 1997)
– Depressive symptoms & distress (Stansfeld & Shipley, 2015)
– Even at very moderate levels:
•
40-45dBA (Bengtsson, 2003; Persson & Bjorkman, 1988; Waye et al, 1997)
Adverse psychological effects - LFN

Acoustics and harm
PwC
• Data often sparse and anecdotal (Leighton, 2018)
• Easily misinterpreted (Duck & Leighton, 2018)
• Detailed knowledge of “noise dose” not always present
– Andringa & Lanser, 2013; Donder et al, 2018
• Many effects not reproducible in labs (Fletcher et al, 2018b)
– Ethical restrictions (Fletcher et al 2018a, 2018b; Leighton, 2018)
– Possible “nocebo” effect
• But significant base for adverse effects in subset of population
Caveats

Acoustics and harm
PwC
• Significant differences in methodology and implementation
• Mostly in occupational context 
• Often based on small samples
• Samples often made up of mostly adult males (Leighton, 2018)

https://www.cirrusresearch.co.uk/blog/2011/08/what-are-a-c-z-frequency-weightings/
Acoustics and harm
PwC
• Consensus that A-weighting is inappropriate
• Underestimates higher frequencies (Lawton, 2001; Leighton, 2018)
• SPL re 20 μPa is commonly used
• As is Z-weighting (flat frequency response from 10Hz – 20kHz, no 
attenuation for sounds above/below ‘audible range’)
Exposure guidelines - HFN
23

PwC
• Fewer guidelines exist
• Perhaps because primary effects are subjective, at moderate levels?
• Again, methodology differs significantly

PwC
• Reference curve proposed by Defra (Moorhouse et al, 2011)
• Devised after assessment of previously published curves
• G-weighting (ISO 7196:1995) commonly used for 1Hz - 20Hz
– But not LFN (Koch, 2017)
