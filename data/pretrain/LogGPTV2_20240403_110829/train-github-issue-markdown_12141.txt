  * OS Version: Mac OS X 10.11.3
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Open a new project and make sure `editor.tabSize` is set to `auto`
  2. Create a new file `test.js` with the following contents
    'use strict';
    const multiline = `
      this is a multiline
      string with 2 space indentation
    `;
    function log(str) {
        console.log(str);
    }
    log(multiline);
> Note: The indentation inside the `log` function is a `tab` but GitHub parses
> it to 4 spaces. So make sure to convert this to a `tab` when copy-pasting.
  1. Close the file and reopen it

As you can see, it sets the `tabSize` to `2` because it is `2` in the
multiline template literal. But it shouldn't take strings into account to
determine this.
