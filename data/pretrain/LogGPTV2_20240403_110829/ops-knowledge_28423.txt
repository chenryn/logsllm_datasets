User: How to use Docker container management tools to manage multiple Docker containers? Please provide example commands and relevant application scenarios.
Assistant: Docker container management tools include Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and Swarm, among others. Among them, Docker Compose is one of the most commonly used management tools, which can simplify the deployment and management of multiple containers. The following are sample commands and application scenarios for using Docker Compose to manage multiple Docker containers: 1. Sample commands Before using Docker Compose to manage containers, you need to create a docker-compose.yml file in the project root directory, and write the document. For example, the following is a simple docker-compose.yml file that contains a web service and a database service: ``` version: '3' services: db: image: mysql:5.7 environment: MYSQL_DATABASE: test_db MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_pwd web: image: nginx:latest ports: - "8080:80" volumes: - ./webapp:/usr/share/nginx/html depends_on: - db ``` In the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located, You can use the following commands to start and manage containers: ``` # Start the container docker-compose up # Start the container in the background docker-compose up -d # View the container status docker-compose ps # Stop the container docker-compose down ``` 2. Application Scenarios Application scenarios for using Docker Compose for container management include: - Web applications: Use Docker Compose to simultaneously start and manage multiple containers required by web applications, such as web servers, databases, caches, etc. - Test Environments: Use Docker Compose to create and manage test environments to quickly deploy multiple containers in tests. - Development environment: Use Docker Compose to create and manage a development environment so that multiple containers can be quickly deployed in development.
