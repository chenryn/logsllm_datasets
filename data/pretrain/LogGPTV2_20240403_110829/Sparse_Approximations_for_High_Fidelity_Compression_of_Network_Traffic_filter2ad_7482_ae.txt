# Traffic Data Compression and Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This document presents a method for compressing and analyzing network traffic data using a greedy pursuit approach over redundant dictionaries. The goal is to enable fine-grained traffic analysis at different scales and resolutions across space and time for network monitoring applications.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Compressed Representation
The original traffic data is compressed into a representation that includes:
- **Compressed Representation**: A compact form of the original data.
- **Residual**: The difference between the original and compressed data.

**Figure 14: Miscellaneous Ports using DF + H + S**
- **(a) Port 80**
- **(b) Port 6346**
- **(c) Port 9898**
- **(d) Port 43726**

Each subplot shows the original traffic, compressed representation, and residual over time (in hours of the week).

### 2.2 Relative Error in Estimating Traffic Trends
**Figure 15: Relative Error in Estimating Traffic Trends**
- The relative error in estimating the trend is less than 0.5% across different ports, confirming the high fidelity of the compression techniques.

### 2.3 Modeling and Anomaly Detection
- **Stability of Fundamental Components**: The underlying fundamental components are stable over time.
- **Traffic Models**: Initial results suggest that traffic models learned from compressed data have almost identical performance to those learned from uncompressed data.

### 2.4 Stopping Criteria
**Figure 16: Evaluating Stopping Criteria**
- **(a) Port 80**
- **(b) Port 1214**

The residual energy has a distinct knee beyond which the rate of drop in residual energy is significantly lower. This indicates that the noise component cannot be efficiently represented by any fundamental component.

### 2.5 Smaller Scales
- **Periodicities in Network Traffic**: At an appropriate aggregation level, network traffic exhibits periodicities.
- **Compression at Finer Granularities**: Preliminary results show that with 5-minute intervals, significant compression can be achieved with fewer coefficients.

**Figure 17: Compressing SNMP Data Collected at Five-Minute Intervals**
- With less than 40 coefficients, the relative error is less than 0.005, indicating substantial compression.

### 2.6 Encoding Techniques
- **Larger Dictionaries**: Using larger dictionaries with full-translation wavelets can achieve better compression, but there is a hidden cost in the effective compression due to the need for more bits to represent dictionary indices.
- **Efficient Encoding**: Methods like Huffman coding can reduce the storage requirement for dictionary indices.

### 2.7 Joint Compression
- **Correlation Across Dimensions**: Multiple sources of correlation across different traffic dimensions can be exploited for better compression.
- **Temporal Stability**: The temporal stability of compressed representations suggests the potential for exploiting similarity across different weeks.
- **Simultaneous Compression Algorithms**: These algorithms approximate all signals using different linear combinations of the same elementary signals, balancing approximation error against the total number of elementary signals used.

### 2.8 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Spatial Compression**: PCA can be used to extract sources of correlation before applying redundant dictionary approaches to compress traffic data.

## 3. Conclusions
- **High Fidelity Representation**: The compression models present a high-fidelity representation for a wide variety of traffic monitoring applications, using less than 20% of the original space requirement.
- **Stable Frequency Components**: Most traffic signals can be compressed and characterized in terms of a few stable frequency components.
- **Ongoing Work**: Evaluating and extracting sources of compression across other spatial and temporal dimensions, and assessing the goodness of traffic models generated from compressed representations.
