8. CONCLUSIONS
Most efforts in the rapidly-growing space of mobile privacy re-
search focus on detection and prevention techniques for informa-
tion leaks, especially those in Android mobile apps [45, 26, 43, 15,
35]. TaintDroid [16] and Aquifer [35] are representative projects
in this space, whose full overview we omit for space reasons. Our
work takes a complementary position: leak detection tools prevent
malicious use of private data, while MOREPRIV offers devlopers a
route to use private data in a way that does not damage the privacy
of the user.
Resolving the tension between extensible personalization and
privacy is not a new problem, which we attempt to address with our
custom classiﬁers mechanism. Much work has been done on ver-
iﬁed extensions, in contexts as diverse as OS drivers and browser
extensions. The problem of checking extensions for privacy leaks
can be addressed via static analysis [6], type systems [21], and run-
time information ﬂow tracking. This kind of validation can be in-
tegrated with MOREPRIV or applied ahead of time by app store
maintainers, but validating extensions is not the focus of our work.
In contrast to many extensible systems, we do not require that cus-
tom classiﬁers be written in a special language, as, for example
in [18].
MOREPRIV falls into the category of efforts advocating client-
side computing as a way to enhance user privacy. In the context
of ad delivery, several researchers advocate remedying the problem
by storing the necessary sensitive personal data on the client, along
with all ads to be matched [23, 44, 27]. When an ad is displayed,
it is matched to personal information locally, thus sidestepping the
need to leak to the ad network. Accounting and click-fraud pre-
vention are addressed using either additional semi-trusted parties,
or homomorphic encryption. Although MOREPRIV can be used in
the context of personalized advertising, it has broader applicability
than advertising alone.
RePriv [18] explored personalization opportunities in the con-
text of a web browser by building a user interest proﬁle based on
the user’s browsing history. RePriv proﬁles classify the sites the
user visits based on the Open Directory Project (ODP) taxonomy
of interests. Unlike RePriv, we focus on the mobile space. We go
further by integrating our system directly into the operating sys-
tem, drawing from more diverse data sources, and provide integrity
through zero-knowledge proofs.
Both MOREPRIV and RePriv are representative of an expand-
ing line of work focusing on client-side computing for privacy.
There are a number of notable differences between RePriv and
MOREPRIV: 1) MOREPRIV user data is very coarse-grained, and
its disclosure to apps is limited. This persona-based approach is
substantially different than the taxonomy-based approach of RePriv;
2) MOREPRIV does not impose a development language and an
onerous-to-use type system on the developer; 3) MOREPRIV alone
provides automatic personalization for legacy apps. The focus on
integrity and the use of Zero-Knowledge proof techniques is spe-
ciﬁc to MOREPRIV as well; 4) Since MOREPRIV is at the OS level,
it has access to different, rich sources or data - personalization ap-
proaches for the browser and OS are substantially different.
Zero-knowledge proofs [5, 7, 13] have seen extensive use in the
privacy and applied cryptography literature. Zero-Knowledge pro-
tocols have been developed for proving linear relations [9], equality
and inequality [41], logical connectives [9], multiplication [10], di-
vision and modulo [11], and set membership [10]. Taken together,
this work allows the construction of a zero-knowledge proof that
expresses the functionality of an arbitrary circuit, as in the case of
fully-homomorphic encryption [19].
This paper proposes operating system-level mechanisms that sup-
port automatic personalization of legacy applications, and simplify
building new personalized applications. Our focus is primarily
on mobile operating systems.
Implementing a tool at this level
allows us leverage a broad variety of user activity, and distill it
into a trusted source of personalization information. We believe
that at the level of the operating system these opportunities are
largely untapped. We demonstrate that personalization can be done
quickly and effectively using personae, which provide a degree of
pseudonymity and are easy for users and developers to understand.
We show how both OS-wide universal personalization and cus-
tom personalization can be done with little effort by the developer,
making us hope that persona and location information can become
equally ubiquitous on mobile devices. We also demonstrate and
experimentally evaluate how MOREPRIV supports integrity of cus-
tom classiﬁers with the help of zero-knowledge proofs. With a
classiﬁer using 100 feature words, the prover time is about 11 sec-
onds, the time to transfer the proof is under a second on an aver-
age 3G connection, and the battery utilization is negligible — un-
der 1 mAh. Our results show that trusted classiﬁcation is feasible
with today’s zero-knowledge techniques.
Finally, we performed a crowd-sourced user study showing that
MOREPRIV-style personalization improves the relevance of Yelp
results, with business executives preferring MOREPRIV personal-
ized results most of the time (a boost of ~30%). In our experiments
we have observed cases where the general population and users
with a particular persona disagree on what is most relevant, high-
lighting the need for user proﬁling and personalization.
We believe MOREPRIV is timely and can enable game-changing
innovation around privacy through client-side computing.
