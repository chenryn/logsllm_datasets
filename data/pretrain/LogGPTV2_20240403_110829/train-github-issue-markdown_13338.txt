After I got the update to Version 0.10.10 (0.10.10) for OSX, the Javascript
"let" keyword is now white (used to be blue, recognized as a reserved word).
I tried adding back the jsconfig.json (which I understand is no longer needed
to enable ES6) and the colorization is still no good.
I wonder if other keywords are being colorized incorrectly.
