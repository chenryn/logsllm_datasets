Freedom Hosting hosted, amongst other things, 
many child porn related hidden service websites.
Freedom Hosting had previously come under attack 
by Anonymous during Op Darknet because of it 
hosting CP.
In July of 2013, the FBI compromised Freedom 
Hosting, and inserted malicious Java Script that 
used Firefox bug CVE-2013-1690 in version 17 ESR. 
The Tor Browser Bundle is based on Firefox, and the 
newest version was already patched, but not 
everyone updates in a timely fashion.

An Irish man, Eric Eoin Marques, is alleged to be 
the operator of Freedom Hosting. The servers 
hosting Freedom Hosting were tied to him because 
of payment records.
Marques was said to have dived for his laptop to 
shut it down when police raided him.

Someone  going  by  the  handle  “Dread  Pirate 
Roberts”  was  the  operator  of  the  SilkRoad, which 
allows sellers and buyers to exchange less than 
legal goods and services.
http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion
With about $1.2 Billion in exchanges on SilkRoad, 
FBI wanted to know who was behind it. 
They started to look for the earliest references to 
the SilkRoad on the public Internet. 
From court documents:
“As of September 23, 2013, there were nearly 13,000 listings for 
controlled substances on the website, listed under the categories 
"Cannabis," "Dissociatives," "Ecstasy," "Intoxicants," "Opioids," 
"Precursors," "Prescription," "Psychedelics," and "Stimulants," among 
others. “
“There  were 159 listings on the site under the category "Services." Most 
concerned computer-hacking services: for example, one listing was by a 
vendor offering to hack into Facebook, Twitter, and other social 
networking accounts of the customer's choosing, so that "You can Read, 
Write, Upload, Delete, View All Personal Info"; another listing offered 
tutorials on "22 different methods" for hacking ATM machines. Other 
listings offered services that were likewise criminal in nature. For 
example, one listing was for a "HUGE Blackmarket Contact List," 
described as a list of "connects" for "services" such as "Anonymous Bank 
Accounts," "Counterfeit Bills (CAD/GBP/EUR/USD) ," "Firearms 
+Ammunition," "Stolen Info (CC [credit card], Paypal) ," and "Hitmen
(10+ countries)." “
“Sellers may not list forgeries of any privately issued documents such as 
diplomas/certifications, tickets or receipts. Also, listings for counterfeit 
currency are still not allowed in the money section.”

The  earliest  they  could  find  was  from  “altoid”  on the Shroomery.org  forums on 01/27/11.

What an awesome thread! You guys have a ton of great ideas. Has anyone 
seen Silk Road yet? It's kind of like an anonymous amazon.com. I don't think 
they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff. They basically use 
bitcoin and tor to broker anonymous transactions. It's at 
http://tydgccykixpbu6uz.onion. Those not familiar with Tor can go to 
silkroad420.wordpress.com for instructions on how to access the .onion site.
Let me know what you guys 
think”https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175.msg42479#msg42479

An  account  named  “altoid”  also  made  a post on Bitcointalk.org about looking 
for an  “IT  pro in the bitcoin community”  and  asked  interested  parties  to  contact  
“rossulbricht at gmail dot com”  (10/11/11).

Ulbricht’s  Google+  profile  show  an  interest    in  the  “Mises Institute”    a  “world  
center of the Austrian School of economics.”
Dread  Pirate  Roberts’  signature  on  the  Silk  Road  forums  had  a  link  to  the  Mises
Institute. Austrian Economic theory was also stated by Dread Pirate Roberts to 
be  influential  to  the  the  Silk  Road’s  philosophy.

"Ross Ulbricht.”  account  also  posted  on  StackOverflow asking for help with PHP code to 
connect  to  a  Tor  hidden  service.  The  username  was  quickly  changed  to  “frosty”  
(03/16/12).
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15445285/how-can-i-connect-to-a-tor-hidden-
service-using-curl-in-php
Guess who is now a suspect for being “Dread  Pirate  Roberts”?  Ross  William Ulbricht.
http://Irongeek.com
Someone was connecting to a server that hosts the Silk Road from an Internet 
café near where Ross lived in San Francisco. Private messages on Silk Road 
make it seem Dread Pirate Roberts lived in the Pacific time zone.
IP of a Silk Road server was attached to via a VPN server that was connected to 
by an IP belonging to an Internet cafe on Laguna Street in San Francisco from 
which Ulbricht had also connected to his Gmail account with (both on June 3, 
2013). 
PM to Dread Pirate Roberts from a user said the site was leaking "some sort of 
external IP address" belonging to the VPN.
FBI starts taking down SilkRoad servers,  though  I’m  are  not  sure  how  they  were  
found. Could have been money trail to aliases, or as Nicholas Weaver 
conjectured, they hacked SilkRoad and made it contact an outsides server 
without  using  Tor  so  it  revealed  it’s  real  IP.  Once  located,  FBI  was  able  to  get  a  
copy of one of the servers.
http://Irongeek.com
On 07/10/13 US Customs intercepted 9 IDs with different names, but all having a picture of 
Ulbricht. Homeland Security interviewed Ulbricht, but he denied having ordered them. 
Smart:  “ULBRICHT  generally refused to answer any questions pertaining to the purchase of 
this or other counterfeit identity documents.”
Stupid:  “However, ULBRICHT volunteered that "hypothetically" anyone could go onto a 
website named "Silk Road" on "Tor" and purchase any drugs or fake identity documents the 
person wanted. “
Roommates  knew  him  as  “Josh”.  PMs  show  DPR  was  interested  in  getting  fake  IDs.

Server used SSH and a public key that ended in frosty@frosty. Server also had some of 
the same code posted on StackOverflow.
Eventually, on  10/01/2013 the FBI Landed on him in a Library right after he entered the 
password for his laptop. More evidence was found on his laptop.
