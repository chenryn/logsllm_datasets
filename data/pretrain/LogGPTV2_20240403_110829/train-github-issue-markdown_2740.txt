  * remove the quote syntax from `extern crate`, require an identifier to be used instead - #23546
  * Prevent duplicate uploads of `foo-bar` and `foo_bar` to crates.io change
  * Automatically translate `-` to `_` in Cargo for passing the `--extern` flag - rust-lang/cargo#1443
As an interim step, the compiler should continue to accept `extern crate "foo-
bar" as ...` both in terms of quotes and in terms of matching the identifier
`foo_bar` as well. This should help reduce the breakage a little.
