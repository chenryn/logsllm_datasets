User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Multiple Users on Apache and Linux and Invalid permissions I have a RedHat setup with Apache and multiple users.  I gave each user a dir in /var/www/html to host their sites.  Sites are served, but cannot write files (eg. log files, uploads, cache files).  I have all the users as members of the group apache and the dir's have write access for the group.  Anything that I am forgetting to do here?

EDIT: Adding some details.
Apache runs as 'apache' with group 'apache'.  All the users are in the apache group, as the user apache is in the users groups.

Assistant: I changed my SELinux to 'permissive' instead of 'enforcing' then restarted the server.  Works now.
