### Notes:
- **N-15, N+14, N+15**: These refer to the undesired DTV channels relative to the desired channel.
- **Und. Level (dBm)**: The level of the undesired signal in decibels milliwatts.
- **D/U (dB)**: The ratio of the desired signal to the undesired signal in decibels.
- **Distance "r" (m)**: The distance from the receiver to the source of the undesired signal in meters.

This format should make the data more organized and easier to understand.
