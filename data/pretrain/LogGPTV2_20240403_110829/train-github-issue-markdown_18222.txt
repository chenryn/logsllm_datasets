 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
inserting multiple rows using single list of row values doesn't work, ex.
    conn.execute("insert into users (user_id, user_name) values (?, ?)", [(10,"donkey")]((9,"barney"),))
or
     conn.execute("insert into users (user_id, user_name) values (%s, %s)", [[4,"ed"]([4,"ed"), [5,"horse"](5,"horse")])
Attached patch fixes this.
