## Expected Behavior
Next should refresh dynamic imported components using HMR.
## Current Behavior
This bug depends on the place where the dynamic component is created. It works
when the dynamic component is created on a page, but it doesn't work when it's
created outside and imported using a regular `import x from`.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Create a component:
    export default () =>  I am the component;
If you import that component and create the dynamic component on that page,
HMR works:
    import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
    const DynamicComponent = dynamic(import('../components/Component.js'));
    export default () => (
    );
But if the dynamic import is on a different file, for example
`DynamicComponent.js`:
    import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
    const DynamicComponent = dynamic(import('./Component'));
    export default DynamicComponent;
And you import it on a page with a regular import, HMR doesn't work:
    import DynamicComponent from '../components/DynamicComponent.js';
    export default () => (
    );
The rest of the dynamic import functionalities seem to work fine even on both
cases, like SSR.
