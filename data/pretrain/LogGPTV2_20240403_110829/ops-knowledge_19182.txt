User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题windows server 2008 instance on KVM stuck in 'Pause' mode I have a windows Server 2008 instance as a guest on KVM. When I tried to run it via virtual machine manager, the process got frozen after few seconds and trying to resume the process lead to this error from virt-manager:------

Error unpausing domain: internal error unable to execute QEMU command 'cont': Resetting the Virtual Machine is required

I tried to Reboot it without any success. Any help will be highly appreciated.
Edit 1:
/var/log/libvirt/qemu/vm2.log

KVM: entry failed, hardware error 0x80000021
If you're running a guest on an Intel machine without unrestricted mode
support, the failure can be most likely due to the guest entering an invalid
state for Intel VT. For example, the guest maybe running in big real mode
which is not supported on less recent Intel processors.

Assistant: your problem happened to me then I try to solve it and I found that happened because KVM memory that I allowed to used from my computer and changed thee "ram from 512 MB allowed to 1024 MB allowed".

You can open virtual manager (virt-manager) and edit your physical KVM resource.
