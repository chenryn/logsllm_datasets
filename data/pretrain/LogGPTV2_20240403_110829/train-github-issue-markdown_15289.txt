**Current Behavior**
The `ngc` command fails when the `noUnusedParameters` option is enabled in `tsconfig.json`. The error message is `'$event' is declared but never used`, even though `$event` is not explicitly declared anywhere in the code.

**Expected Behavior**
The `ngc` command should not fail when the `noUnusedParameters` option is enabled in `tsconfig.json`.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Clone the repository that reproduces the issue.
2. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`.

**Motivation for Changing the Behavior**
To support the `noUnusedParameters` setting in TypeScript, which helps ensure that all function parameters are used, thereby improving code quality and maintainability.

**Environment Information**
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Angular Version:** 4.0.0
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.2
- **Node Version (for AoT issues):** v7.7.2
