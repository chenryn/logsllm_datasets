How Set Testing Works
How do I protect myself!?
One of these is not like the others...
The S&G 6741 … can be dialed up to 1.25 digits 
above or below the actual set number and still 
open, essentially giving you a 2.5 digit window to 
hit. The S&G 6730, however, has only a +/- .5 
dialing tolerance, essentially giving a 1 digit 
window to hit. While many locksmiths might prefer 
the S&G 6730, it can be notoriously difficult to 
open and very unforgiving to human error. In 
addition, slight alterations to the lock (for example, 
if the dial or the dial ring was bumped during 
shipping) can shift the combination, rendering the 
lock unusable.
