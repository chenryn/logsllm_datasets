encing a target for the sake of the mission. As an example, you can-
not be so in love with your client’s business that you hold back from
trying to beat it. In this case and in these moments, your morals
must be applied to the greater good. As attackers, we have to sol-
emnly believe that everything we do is for something bigger than
ourselves and winning in that moment.
There’s one other nuance to morals that’s worth covering: the
greater good of a mission, rather than the acts of it, are items to
The Attacker Mindset Framework 55
be concentrated on when executing. This guideline is most appli-
cable to those who have a harder job than mine: hunting terrorists,
human traffickers, and other such factions. Morals and ethics aren’t
applied to the targets of these operations and investigations. Our
moral psychology as humans dictates that we apply morals to those
who are hurt, not those who are responsible for the hurt.
Ultimately, you may have to look at what you are doing through
the lens of the consequences that will ensue and see if you can rec-
oncile the two from a moralistic standpoint. Notably, guilt and mor-
als or sadness and morals or any other emotion and morals aren’t
mutually exclusive, but knowing your intent matters. It gives a
sense of meaning to otherwise difficult work.
Moreover, the field of ethics (or moral philosophy) involves sys-
tematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and
wrong behavior. It is widely accepted that ethical theories can be
divided into three general subject areas: metaethics, normative eth-
ics, and applied ethics. We will skip the first and look at normative
ethics. For us, as social engineers, we look to the Social Engineering
Framework, written by Christopher Hadnagy:
Set out in this framework is The Social Engineering Code of Eth-
ics which accomplishes three important goals: it promotes pro-
fessionalism in the industry, establishes ethics and policies that
dictate how to be a professional SE, and provides guidance on
how to conduct a social engineering business. More than this it
defines moral standards that regulate right and wrong conduct.
It involves articulating the good habits that we should acquire,
the duties that we should follow, and the consequences of our
behavior on others. The following 10 bulleted points comprise the
Social Engineering Code of Ethics:
• Respect the public by accepting responsibility and ownership over
your actions, and their effects on the welfare of those in, around,
and involved with the engagement.
• Before undertaking any social engineering engagement, ensure
you are fully aware of the scope and effects on others and their
well- being.
56 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
• Avoid engaging in, or being a party to, unethical, unlawful, or illegal
acts that negatively affect your professional reputation, the informa-
tion security discipline, the practice of social engineering, others’
well- being, or the parties and individuals in, around, and involved
with the engagement.
• Reject any engagement, or aspect of an engagement, that may make
a target feel vulnerable or discriminated against. This includes, but
is not limited to, sexual harassment, offensive comments (verbal,
written, or otherwise) related to gender, sexual orientation, race,
religion, or disability; stalking or following, deliberate intimidation,
or harassing materials. Additionally, lewd or offensive behavior or
language, which may be sexually explicit or offensive in nature,
materials or conduct, language, behavior, or content that contains
profanity, obscene gestures, or gendered, religious, ethnic, or racial,
slurs are all to be avoided. Employing any of these tactics reduces
the target’s ability to learn and improve from the engagement.
• Do not negatively manipulate, threaten, or make others uncomfort-
able in any way, unless specified by a client due to unique needs and
testing environment.
• Minimize risks to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
information of your employer, clients, and individuals involved in
engagements. After performing a social engineering engagement,
ensure the security of obtained information is a priority. Never
disclose information to outside parties as private and confidential
information must remain private and confidential. Do not mis-
use any information or privileges you are afforded as part of your
responsibilities.
• When training future social engineers, consider that training will
leave a lasting impact on your students and the methodology with
which you train will echo through all students’ future engagements.
Provide students with the knowledge and tools to create positive
learning environments and productive scenarios for their future
engagements and clients.
• Ensure the social engineering practices of yourself and your stu-
dents include conscientious, thoughtful, and considerate ways
to escalate engagements to eventually emulate real- world attack
vectors. Recognize our clients are seeking ways to improve their
The Attacker Mindset Framework 57
security posture and work with them to increase the difficulty of
realistic attack vectors.
• Respect that social engineering engagements involve human vul-
nerability and avoid publicizing vulnerabilities, whether through a
blog, social media, or other medium, that result in harmful effects,
emotions, or feelings for your client and the individuals and parties
in, around, and involved with the engagement.
• Do not misrepresent your abilities or your work to the commu-
nity, your employer, or your peers. Ensure you have the experi-
ence and knowledge promised to your clients and stakeholders.

Social Engineering and Security
Switching gears a little, let’s look at social engineering in conjunc-
tion with AMs because they are closely related. Much of what makes
up AMs is facilitated in the real world by using social engineering.
Although many social engineering attacks are diverse and dynamic
in nature, common patterns emerge when we break down attacks.
For instance, social engineering most often uses OSINT followed
by rapport building and elicitation of help and assistance themes,
which we will delve into later. Some attacks use fear as a theme, and
others use greed. Nonetheless, after performing OSINT, social engi-
neers typically rely on their social skills to advance an attack, which
is both deceivingly underwhelming and terrifying all at once, that
a social engineer may be able to elicit information from a person to
create and then exploit a vulnerability should not be ignored. It’s
the weaponizing of a person who, if effective, can circumvent the
most modern and hardened defenses.
There are many forms of social engineering; the main vec-
tors are phishing (email), vishing (voice call), SMShing (text mes-
sage), and in person (this includes impersonation). As attackers,
58 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
we need to be able to execute attacks down any and all of these
vectors. Network pentesters have to apply the attacker mindset
to identify, exploit, and resolve security vulnerabilities and weak-
nesses affecting a target’s digital assets and computer networks,
too. Then, in some cases, they must use social engineering to fur-
ther their attack or hold.
However, this book does not strictly cover social engineering.
This book is (obviously) about AMs, and AMs and social engi-
neering are not one and the same; rather, they are relatives. Given
that, there’s no doubt that social engineering has become a serious
occurrence in information security. I often describe it as the inter-
section of social skill and business stress testing, but what it boils
down to is human versus human. As has already been pointed out,
social engineers employ certain tactics, like fear, authority, scarcity,
and rapport — building techniques, to strengthen their attacks. All
of these can prove powerful for an attacker to leverage against their
target, but we cannot afford to focus on them here. This is because
you can be a social engineer but possess no real form of the attacker
mindset; it is neither acting skills nor influential acumen alone
that makes an attacker’s mindset, although both can be helpful. It’s
truly the discovery and application of information that forms this
mentality.
As I will cover in this book, curiosity and persistence are the
driving forces of the discovery of information, but this discovery
requires a methodology— a systematic approach to OSINT is there-
fore paramount. Understanding that data is abundantly available is
something I consider to be a strong and optimistic outlook; being
aware that you will have to parse large amounts of data efficiently
and effectively, and filtering it to the items that are critical for the
success of the mission, is a skill that requires self- discipline and an
unwavering dedication to the objective at hand. You should always
keep in the back of your mind that sometimes you have to apply
information to gain information.
The Attacker Mindset Framework 59
The application of information is made easier if the primary
step of collecting it is performed properly. Seeing weakness through
the lens of the information you are collecting and applying it is the
logical extension of the discovery phase.
Social Engineering vs. AMs
Again, it’s beyond all doubt that social engineering is a serious dis-
cipline with serious consequences. Neglecting to comprehend the
nature and power of it over security will only ever serve to decrease
the security posture of our organizations. KnowB4.com estimates
that 98 percent of cyberattacks rely on social engineering (https://
blog.knowbe4.com/social-e ngineering-i s-a -c ore-e lement-o f-
nearly-e very-c yber-a ttack). As a social engineer, my job is to
influence others to obtain my objective. But I could do that with-
out any presence of AMs at all. For example, I don’t need any real
semblance of AMs to make a call, follow a script, and hope that the
target unwittingly helps me achieve my objective, but I could still
be classified as a social engineer. You can see this lack of AMs in
other related industries, such as “script kiddies” in programming
and ethical hacking— not having an underlying skill doesn’t pre-
clude you from achieving an objective at times.
At the same time, forming an objective and knowing how to col-
lect information and how to apply it to a target to reach my objective—
but not being able to make the call, write the phish, or approach a
target— would make me a terrible social engineer. I’d be hitting all
the AMs targets by about 80 percent, but my execution would suf-
fer. So, social engineering and AMs are closely related but not always
mutually exclusive—t hey do overlap. In fact, they can and should
be used in a way that makes them functionally reliant on each other
because they are most powerful when used together, not separately.
Not all professional social engineers seem to exhibit the quali-
ties of an attacker; rather, they are readily able to follow scripts and
hope for the desired outcome. This way of working directly affects
those businesses and people we are trying to secure because often
a play-b y- play of the attack is offered with limited insight into how
60 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
to solve for future attacks. I fundamentally believe that the best
of all social engineers should have a sharp and effective attacker
mindset. Blending social engineering with an AMs will place you
in an elite category whereby you can identify, exploit, and explain
security gaps. This blend is a massive benefit to your clients, who
depend on you to give them more than a step- by- step account of the
actions you took to circumvent their defenses. To best protect them,
you should be able to give them a comprehensive understanding of
their whole landscape as you perceive it, not only how you bypassed
some of their defenses arbitrarily.
No business should be without an attacker mindset specialist—
not if they want to accurately see themselves as the targets mali-
cious attackers do, yet protect themselves and their customers as
ferociously and as comprehensively as they possibly can.
Summary
• Social engineering is a dominant discipline in which influence is
used as a method of evading security measures at a human level.
• AMs and social engineering are not one and the same, but
they are closely related. By understanding the detailed charac-
teristics of social engineering, you can build an effective AMs
more easily.
• All social engineers should be able to think like an attacker
because, as previously mentioned, social engineering is involved
in 98 percent of cyberattacks.
• Social engineering is a way to use your attacker mindset, not a
way to form it.
• How you gather information makes the mindset as well as the
direction you take as an attacker.
Key Message
Social engineering is a formidable practice in which persuasion
is used as a technique to circumvent security measures and gain
The Attacker Mindset Framework 61
information or access to it. You can be a social engineer but possess
no real form of attacker mindset; it is the discovery and application
of information that forms this mentality. AMs and social engineer-
ing are most powerful when used together, not separately.
Our belief in ideals and ethics are what make up a society. If you
believe in those and you are defending them, you are working for
the greater good. With AMs working for the community, not against
it, and with your intentions set toward good, you’ll have fewer hard
days at work.

The Laws
Let all your efforts be directed to something, let [your mind] keep
that end in view.
—­Seneca
T
here are four laws of the attacker mindset. They are all heav-
ily interlaced and interdependent. In this chapter, we will
look at them and explore how to use them effectively.
Law 1: Start with the End in Mind
Assuming you already have a contract and a contact in place, there’s
really only one correct place to start an attack—a t the end. To start
with the end in mind is the first law of AMs. But doing so is material
to how the rest of the skills are used, too. You cannot blindly point to
information about anyone on anything and then build and execute
an attack. You need to know a couple of points to start: who you are
attacking and to what end. The “who” is generally solved for you—
the client typically approaches you or you will sell your services to
them. Either the “what end” is defined by the client— who will know
65
66 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
what they wish to protect but want to know how easily it can be
accessed or destroyed— or the client will not define their assets
as such, asking you to simply penetrate their defenses as deeply
as you can.
Given that, there’s an almost infinite list of objectives to be
achieved for an impossibly large list of businesses the world over, so
I won’t try to list them all. But most often for a security professional,
the items most likely on the list of objectives will be (a) gaining
information or (b) gaining access to an asset. So, with those goals in
mind, we have our immediate ends in sight.
This phase of the attack is the only one in which your AMs has
absolutely no barriers or boundaries. At this point, you aren’t par-
ticularly concerned with ethics— you’re only looking for informa-
tion or vulnerabilities to use against your target. The attack will
later be adjusted for ethics and the after processes will be a direct
result of them, but at least for now, your AMs can create, craft, and
plan unincumbered, stopping only to consider scope.
End to Start Questions
Just as in chess, where the central objective is to checkmate the oppo-
nent’s king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture, your
central objective is to capture your target’s information or asset one
move at a time. To do this, there is a short list of important things to
be considered. Starting at the last to be considered physically, but the
first to be considered in planning, we have the following:
• How to leave with the information or asset intact?
• How to secure the information or asset (to ensure you maintain
custody of it)?
• Security surrounding information or asset?
• Location(s) of information or asset?
• Weak point in security and means needed to circumvent it?
• Larger area around information or asset and means to traverse
area around it (the building it’s housed in or the network secu-
rity active to safeguard it)?
The Laws 67
• Pretext for approach and entry?
• Economy of force (applying personnel in the most effective way
possible)?
I’ve had a job where my end goal was to move money from the
bank to “my” account. My top question, “How to leave with the infor-
mation or asset intact?” is pretty easy to answer on this one—i t will
be intact when it hits my account. But the second question on my
list, “How to secure the information or asset?” becomes a bit of a
headache, because to ensure safety of this transaction, I’d ideally like
to be there to see it happen, to see it being­sent. Having not actually
robbed a bank before, I can’t say for certain, but I feel sure it’s not like
in the movies where an 8-b it green bar fights to make its way across
