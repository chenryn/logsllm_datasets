### Request for Adding a Mail Plugin to Send Emails to Different Services (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)

**Use Case and Observation:**
Currently, we are using Nodemailer to send reports generated by Playwright. However, we have observed some issues with this approach. Specifically, the asynchronous nature of Nodemailer sometimes causes it to fail, and in some instances, it sends an outdated report (n-1) instead of the most recent one. To address these issues, it would be beneficial to implement a more robust mailing functionality.

**Issues with Nodemailer:**
- **Asynchronous Nature:** Nodemailer operates asynchronously, which can lead to timing issues. The reports are generated after the completion of the context, and there is no way to synchronize or hold the process to ensure that the correct report is sent.
- **Incorrect Report Sent:** Due to the asynchronous behavior, Nodemailer occasionally picks up and sends the previous report (n-1) instead of the most recent one.

**Proposed Solution:**
We propose adding a mail plugin that can reliably send emails to different services such as Gmail and Outlook. This plugin should be designed to handle the synchronization of report generation and email sending, ensuring that the most recent report is always sent.

**Benefits:**
- **Reliability:** The new mail plugin will provide a more reliable method for sending emails, reducing the likelihood of errors and incorrect reports being sent.
- **Synchronization:** It will ensure that the email is sent only after the most recent report has been fully generated, thus avoiding the issue of sending outdated reports.

Please let us know if you need any further information or assistance in implementing this solution.
