 3 20:10:58 INFO File Output Committer Algorithm version is 1
 4 20:10:58 INFO File Output Committer Algorithm version is 1
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Successfully started service 'org.apache.spark.network.netty.NettyBlockTransferService' on port <*>. 和 File Output Committer Algorithm version is <*>
B: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 Changing modify acls to: <*>
C: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Slf4jLogger started
D: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Starting remoting
