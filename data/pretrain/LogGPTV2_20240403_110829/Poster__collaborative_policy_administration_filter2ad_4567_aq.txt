(social capital, historical heritage traditional craftsmanship, accessible advanced technology) and aiming at 
achieving socially recognized goals in new ways. A kind of innovation driven by social demands rather than by the 
market and/or scientific and technological possibilities (i.e. because the innovation is socially desirable not solely 
because the innovation is possible. Typically, this social innovation is generated more by the actors involved than 
by specialist. For product designers this may require a re-emphasis of focus. Systems as well as objects need to 
be addressed in the design process, and can be part of its delivery i.e. “Systems thinking is an essential part of 
schooling for sustainability. A systems approach helps … people understand the complexity of the world around 
them and encourages them to think in terms of relationships, connectedness, and context”
Emerging Sustainable Ways of Living 
Over the past decade social innovation has spread: a variety of social actors throughout the world (institutions, 
enterprises, non-profit organizations and, most of all, networks of collaborative people) have moved outside 
mainstream models of thinking and in so doing, are generating a variety of promising initiatives such as 
community-supported agriculture, co-housing, car-pooling, community gardens, neighborhood care, talent 
exchange and time banks. See case studies discussed in the book “What’s Mine is Yours”. Also see the DESIS website 
http://www.desis-network.org/ and/ or those case studies   included in the Socially Responsive Design, special 
edition of Co Design (2011) Journal edited by Lorraine Gamman and Adam Thorpe, These initiatives propose 
viable solutions to complex problems of the present (e.g. social cohesion, 
urban regeneration, healthy food accessibility, water and sustainable 
energy management).   Some of your projects may end up encouraging 
use of shared assets or promoting collaborations that   figure out new 
ways to create products, services, environments, and experiences that 
promote the idea of, or are at least conducive to, sharing. There are 
many examples of such approaches that have already been generated by 
design. For example, commercial service design solutions such as Street 
Car – now merged with Zip car (http://www.zipcar.com/), and Zimride 
(http://public.zimride.com/) which aim to get more people to share cars 
66
to help reduce carbon emissions has been successful. Or there are those architectural 
projects, listed by RIBA who are concerned with longevity, and deliver buildings that can 
have a longer lifespan so that they can better withstand chronic use. Some services, 
like neighbourgoods, (http://www.neighborgoods.net/), take advantage of technology 
to enable people to efficiently and effectively share tangible products, spaces and 
services in real-time in the communities where they are.   These are the sort of 
examples of social innovation we have in mind. 
Sharing by many people of the same product, space or environment means a long-
term effect of less production and therefore less waste. In addition, sharing is more 
cost effective than buying something for one use or occasion. Many people in urban areas find 
sharing increasingly attractive where neighbors are plentiful and storage space is scarce. Maybe such ideas can 
inform your project for Camden, you will need to consult to know if your ideas are viable for the communities 
you work with. Certainly, many design agencies are now engaged in delivering these sorts of design services from 
IDEO to Participle, from Think Public to Engine, from the Helen Hamlyn Centre to Socially Responsive Design and 
Innovation Hub and Design Against Crime Research Centre, from the Design Council to Livework, designers are co 
designing their ideas with the community and leading and generating design led social responses. These projects 
appear as part of a paradigm shift in terms of socially responsive design. They provide new tangible models of 
design that product designers can engage with, services that enable new more sustainable ways of living including 
collaborative consumption. 
Design for Social Innovation 
Today, social innovation is generating a constellation of small initiatives, some design led, all trying to make the 
world a better more sustainable place.   If favorable conditions are created, these small, local social inventions and 
their working prototypes can spread. They can be scaled-up, consolidated, replicated and integrated with larger 
programmes to generate large-scale sustainable changes. To do that, new design competencies are needed, and 
this is where you come in. Indeed, social innovation processes require visions, strategies and co-design tools and 
approaches to move from ideas to mature solutions and viable programmes. These new design capabilities, as a 
whole, can be defined as design for social innovation. 
Public and Collaborative Services 
An interesting phenomenon is emerging worldwide: more and more people are choosing to behave actively and 
collaboratively (see bibliography). These new attitudes are driven by several social and economic factors and 
often leverage access to new technologies to enable a higher level of connectivity. In this new context, people 
are enabled to establish direct links between interested peers. This connectivity opens new opportunities for 
meaningful activism and effective collaborations. 
Given this new social and technological environment, and given the growth of problems people are facing 
in their everyday lives, new solutions are being invented and enhanced. Within these solutions those who 
have traditionally been individual end-users tend to become collaborative co-producers of the services and 
organisations that facilitate their everyday lives, as people who traditionally had been considered as “parts of the 
problem” become agents of the solution. In these scenarios the services that these social innovations generate, 
are “co-designed” and co-delivered with the involvement of the final users: their knowledge and creativity, in 
conceiving them, and their time, energy and expertise, in delivering them. This project will require you to engage 
with such processes, that are already being used by DACRC/SRVDI team and will be taught to you not just in 
theory but through practice. 
When they appear, these everyday life (or ‘bottom up’) social innovations are rather fragile and highly localized 
entities. To last in time (i.e. be sustainable) and spread to involve larger numbers of people and other geographic 
67
locations their value must be recognized and supported. To do this a new generation of public services are needed. 
Public services capable of supporting local, collaboratively produced and delivered innovations, to make them 
more effective and to promote their diffusion in other contexts. 
The idea that, facing the current economic and social challenges, the public sector in general and public services in 
particular should be radically reshaped is widely diffused, the governments big society agenda is an example of this 
sort of thinking. However, what is less well defined and diffused are the strategies and means with which to do it. 
This project will provide tools and techniques to deliver social innovation. It will seek local and collaborative 
strategies for reducing carbon emissions in the London Borough of Camden. It asks you, the designer, to work with 
Camden Council’s sustainability team and Camden residents to collaboratively design innovations and/or services 
that themselves are locally and collaboratively delivered to facilitate behaviors and ways of living that reduce 
carbon emissions and contribute to achievement of a new vision for a sustainable, low carbon Camden. And, in 
so doing, to explore what public services could become if, instead of offering final services to individual, passive 
end-users, they would be conceived as platforms to trigger, enable and support citizens’ active and collaborative 
behaviors. 
THE CLIENT
The Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC) and its Socially Responsive Design and Innovation hub (SRvDI) 
are working with Camden Council and student groups   to develop ideas with residents and community groups to 
co design sustainable change.   Camden’s Green Camden campaign is already moving in the right direction, and 
our job is to use design to make such initiatives more effective.   To make it clearer and easier for residents to 
take green action linked to social innovation. As part of its Green Camden programme the Council has created and 
delivered a number of engagement streams, a user friendly website, a green directory of local businesses, a green 
map of resources and services, face to face workshops and stalls, a free phone helpline and a Green Camden Zones 
programme, so there are already resources available for students to use. 
The client team will include Adam Thorpe (project lead) and Professor Lorraine Gamman (SRvDI @ CSM) and Anna 
Ware, Ines Carvalho and Katy Mann (Green Camden), 
This project asks you, the designer, to choose an issue that you can or could feel passionately about. Then to work 
with us (DACRC/SRVDI/Camden Council) as the client to approach the residents and community groups within a 
Green Camden Zone to co-design new ways to achieve carbon reduction through collective action to make such 
change easier and more effective.  
Reduce their carbon emissions 
Adapt to a changing climate 
Reduce, reuse and recycle perhaps linked to collaborative/shared assets 
Improve air quality 
Improve biodiversity. 
Brief
The programme has 5 overarching aims: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Council has identified 27 actions with 73 sub-actions that people can take to 
help to achieve these aims. 
The Green Camden Zones programme encourages residents to engage with their 
neighbors to take these actions collectively. Each zone is focussing on at least one 
of the 27 actions (such as cycling or food growing), and is creating an action plan to 
achieve their goals. Your job is to think about what can you do, after consulting with 
residents, to help us and them make effective change happen, through co design.

Stage 1.  Sustainable actions and promising cases: Green Week events and briefing on 8th February 
The project will have been introduced to you by tutors on 30th January – when you will be asked to start reading 
from the bibliography. The first week of activities will occur during CSM’s “Green Week”, and you will be expected 
to attend a briefing with us on 8th February at 1.15 and then Jonathan Chapman’s lecture that has been organised 
for all students in the afternoon. During these early weeks of the project we will require students to familiarise 
themselves with Green Camden’s sustainable actions.   Also to listen to a number of presentations from us and 
during Green Week that will introduce the ideas and approaches, processes and methods that have been proven 
to be effective in collaborative design of social innovations, to form a student group, chose a set of actions to 
engage with and then find and research precedent case studies of collaborative innovations that have been 
used to address these actions and/or their objectives. Students will then create a first research presentation that 
will communicate the meaningful case studies that groups have found, and thus begin to collate a ‘innovations 
pool’ comprising examples of innovations and services that the group feel have potential to facilitate effective 
collaborative achievement of Green Camden action objectives. These findings will be presented to class and 
project partners, as indicated below, when students will be required to identify the actions they wish to and/or 
action themes they wish to explore with Camden Green Zone residents and community groups. 
Stage 2.  Community engagement and collaborative research: 14th February, 21st February and 20th February (RSA 
brief launched) 
Each student group will be matched with one of the Camden Green Zones. Students will work with the residents 
and community groups within the Green Zone to collaboratively explore the diverse demography of residents 
within the zones and their ‘assets’ and ‘needs’ in relation to sustainable objectives, Also, the actions already being 
taken by residents to address Green Camden and other community sustainability objectives and the potential for 
further collaborative achievement of the Green Camden actions and other community sustainability objectives. The 
groups will also identify the existing and potential barriers to achievement of the actions and objectives, and try 
and generate first concepts in responding to these challenges. Students will visualise their findings and feedback 
to the class, the Green Zone residents and other project partners. 
NB Further concept work and development will occur during the Easter Vacation (15th March – 15h April). By 20 
February, when entry forms will be available students may consider entering the RSA “Shared Assets” competition 
whose final deadline for submission is 27 March, 2012 
Stage 3.  Co-design of collaborative innovations and services: 17th April – 30th April – co-design/organise workshops 
1st May – workshop day 
Using the case studies they have collected, as well as initial design concepts that have been generated as a 
starting point for discussion students will deliver co-design workshops with Green Zone resident groups to 
explore ways that design may i) facilitate further achievement of existing actions and ii) catalyse and facilitate 
achievement of newly identified actions objectives and concepts. Students will visualise the results of these 
workshops and iteratively co-develop proposals (with residents) for innovations and services that Green Camden 
Zone residents and community groups consider to be viable and desirable strategies (innovations and services) for 
achievement of Green Camden actions via collaboration. 
Stage 4.  Public service facilitation and integration: 2nd May – 14th May and final hand in on 15th May with presentations 
Final proposals will be presented to Camden Council and project partners to explore how the Council might 
enable and support the residents’ active and collaborative proposals. 
METHOD
Many design agencies use a model of the design process to help them struture their activities.   We think our 
adaption of the Design Council’s Double Diamond model (http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/designprocess) can help 
you structure your thinking too. So we ask you to follow these stages: 
69
Diagnose 
The diagnose phase will deliver research to inform the appropriate set up and study area of the project. It will also 
scope the key challenges of the project.   The diagnose phase will include the following tasks: 
• 
Familiarisation and investigation of geographic and demographic study area(s) (Green Camden Zones) and high 
carbon and low carbon behaviors (Green Camden actions). 
Discover 
‘Discovery mapping’ of the geographic study area(s): 
Journey/scenario mapping (activities of daily living) 
Stakeholder mapping 
Agenda/driver mapping 
Resource mapping 
The students learn about the needs and aspirations of their Green Zone Residents by studying their background, 
interests and routines, and by charting their activities of daily living. This may involve documenting journeys or 
tasks undertaken by the residents. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
These insights are visualised and used to aid communication/understanding between diverse stakeholders and 
also to locate specific opportunities for design intervention or further, more detailed, exploration. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Define 
User centred design research methods: 
Observation 
Shadowing 
Design probes/video diaries 
The define phase of research will review the findings of the discover phase activities to define the sustainable 
behaviors to be focused upon and design of the co-design workshops to follow. Students may also create 
‘personas’ that define the diverse demography and characteristics of the residents they are working with and 
visualise their user centred research findings so that they can be shared with the group within the co-design 
workshop activities. 
Develop 
Student design teams, assisted by the SRvDI Hub team and BAPD tutors, will work with the resident groups to 
deliver workshops to co-design proposals for innovations and services that are appropriate and effective for 
promoting sustainable lifestyles among residents.

COURSE SUBMISSION  
• 
• 
• 
• 
On 15th may you will give a formal visual presentation to the course team. 
You will show materials from up to four a3 boards (max. 4), Or digital material no longer than 5 mins in 
running time, showing design development and final designs 
You will produce a short, typewritten text not exceeding 200-300 words (1 page) and set in 12pt type 
describing your solution, and the process by which you reached it, and the benefits you believe it will 
create, possibly to be used as your show board or a catalogue entry if dacrc/srvdi create one. 
Any models or mock-ups in addition to your boards will be looked or can be presented in photoshop. 
We have decided not to subject 3d work to precisely the same deadlines as last year because we found 
3d work for show was finalised over a longer period and arrived later. 
•  We will also look briefly at any sketchbook or other material you care to submit illustrating 
development of your solution in response to the brief – if you want us to. All work should be referenced 
for relevance in your final presentation and in the short typewriten write up of the project if you want 
it assessed. 
TIME-SCALE  
The project will run from 8th February to 15th May when final presentations are made.   After that material will 
be prepared for your Summer Degree Show.

ABSTRACT
This article will present some learning’s and reflection on what role we as a design school can take when 
running a DESIS lab where we approach several of the urgent challenges that face society today. First I will 
introduce the base for our work, which takes place in the intersection between social innovation, participatory 
design and living labs. Then I will give four examples of what we call agonistic small-scale experiments, where 
we not only explore potential solutions but also try to raise questions and dilemmas and allow controversies 
to reside side by side. Finally I will present four sets of reflections from what we learned so far where I more 
deeply discuss the implications of doing agonistic experiments. I will also reflect on how we recently have tried 
to build alliances with other research disciplines and civil servants to perform ’friendly hacking’. A strategy 
where we through policy work push the boundaries of the lab and expand the potential impact of our activities.

1.  INTRODUCTION
1.1 Agonistic public participatory design
Our background is since many years within 
participatory design (PD), which is the foundation of 
our research activities. This discipline emphasizes 
the issue of democracy and started from the simple 
standpoint that those affected by a design should 
have a say in the design process. It has for many 
years been concerned with power relations [1, 15], 
which means paying attention to ‘weaker’ voices and 
social exclusion. Recent years PD has moved from 
a strong focus on ‘work place’ controversies related 
to information technology to become increasingly 
engaged in public spheres and everyday life, where 
design activities are rather heterogeneous, partly 
open, engaging users and other stakeholders across 
organizational and community borders. Moving 
towards the public we have been inspired by the 
pragmatic philosopher Dewey. For him ‘the public’ 
was not an undifferentiated mass and he rather 
emphasized the plural form where multiple publics 
emerged around an issue [13, 14, 4, 5]. As many others 
we have also for long acknowledged how new design 
solutions needs to be tried out and situated in the 
real world context, where heterogeneous elements, 
such as people, practices, processes, artifacts needs to 
be interwoven into artful integration [39], from this 
follow that we have paid a lot of attention to the act 
of performing small-scale experiments in real world 
contexts [3]. Experiments or prototyping is also well 
established within the design and social innovation 
practice and most often done as way to test a possible 
solution [7, 8]. However, prototyping can also be seen 
as an approach that can raise questions, controversies 
and dilemmas. Together with other researchers we 
have been inspired by Chantal Mouffe who use the 
term agonism to describe a political process that 
allow controversies to exist side by side, instead of 
negotiating them into consensus, For her, ‘agonostic 
spaces’ allow polyphony of conflicting voices which, 
despite their opposition, respect each other and are 
united by passionate engagement [30]. Though social
