Hi guys,  
in the latest javascript file of bootstrap is an error in my opinion... (in
all 3.0.x versions)  
The problem is in the Collapse.prototype.show function.  
Especially because of the 'collapsing' transition. Here you remove the
'collapse' class, because you are adding 'collapsing'. But after this step is
complete, you are removing 'collapsing', but do not add the normal 'collapse'
again, only in.
Which results in a lot of problems, because most application are waiting for
an 'collapse in' class (as the documentation stated), which will be never
there..
I made an fiddle to illustrate my point, if the content is shown it has only
the class 'in':
