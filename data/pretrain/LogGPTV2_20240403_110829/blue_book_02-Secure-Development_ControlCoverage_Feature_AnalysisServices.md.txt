AnalysisServicesDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptAll users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.MediumYesNoMinimize the number of Analysis Service adminsAnalysis Service admins have full access on the server to perform any operation. Each additional person in the admin role increases the attack surface for the server. The number of members in these roles should be kept to as low as possible.MediumYesNoDatabase users must be added to database roles with minimum required permissionGranting minimum access ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes permission of operations at the Analysis Server in case of user account compromise.MediumNoNoAnalysis Service clients should authenticate users using Azure Active Directory backed credentialsUsing the native enterprise directory for authentication ensures that there is a built-in high level of assurance in the user identity established for subsequent access control.All Enterprise subscriptions are automatically associated with their enterprise directory (xxx.onmicrosoft.com) and users in the native directory are trusted for authentication to enterprise subscriptions.HighNoNoSensitive data must be encrypted in transitUse of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.HighNoNoSensitive data must be encrypted at restUsing this feature ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest.
