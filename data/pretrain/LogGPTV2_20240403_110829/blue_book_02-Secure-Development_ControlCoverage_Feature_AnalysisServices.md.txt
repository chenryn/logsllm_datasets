## Important Notice: DevOps Kit (AzSK) Sunset
Please be advised that the DevOps Kit (AzSK) will be sunset by the end of FY21. For more information, please refer to the [AzSK Sunset Notice](../../../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md).

### Analysis Services: Description and Rationale

#### Control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Minimum Required Permissions
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Automated Fix Script:** Yes
- **Rationale:** Granting minimum access through RBAC ensures that users are provided with only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, thereby minimizing the exposure of resources in the event of a user or service account compromise.

#### Control: Minimize the Number of Analysis Service Administrators
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Automated Fix Script:** No
- **Rationale:** Analysis Service administrators have full access to the server, allowing them to perform any operation. Each additional administrator increases the attack surface. Therefore, the number of administrators should be kept to a minimum to reduce potential security risks.

#### Control: Database Users with Minimum Required Permissions
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Automated Fix Script:** No
- **Rationale:** Assigning database users to roles with the minimum required permissions ensures that they have just enough access to perform their tasks. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized operations in case of a user account compromise.

#### Control: Azure Active Directory (AAD) Authentication for Analysis Service Clients
- **Severity:** High
- **Automated Fix Script:** No
- **Rationale:** Using AAD for authentication provides a high level of assurance in the user's identity, which is crucial for subsequent access control. All enterprise subscriptions are automatically associated with their enterprise directory (e.g., `xxx.onmicrosoft.com`), and users in this directory are trusted for authentication.

#### Control: Encryption of Sensitive Data in Transit
- **Severity:** High
- **Automated Fix Script:** No
- **Rationale:** Utilizing HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from various attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.

#### Control: Encryption of Sensitive Data at Rest
- **Severity:** High
- **Automated Fix Script:** No
- **Rationale:** Encrypting sensitive data at rest minimizes the risk of data loss from physical theft and helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.

#### Control: Backup and Disaster Recovery Planning for Analysis Services
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Automated Fix Script:** Yes
- **Rationale:** Azure Analysis Service does not provide built-in features for backup and disaster recovery. Therefore, it is essential to plan and implement adequate backups, especially when processing critical workloads, to ensure data availability and integrity.
