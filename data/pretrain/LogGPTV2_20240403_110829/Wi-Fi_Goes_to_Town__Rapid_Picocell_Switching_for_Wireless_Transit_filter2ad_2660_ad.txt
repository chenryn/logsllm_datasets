### 8.2 Mbits/s UDP Throughput in Single-Client Scenario

In a single-client scenario, the system achieves an 8.2 Mbits/s UDP throughput, which is 2.5× and 2.1× higher than the TCP and UDP throughput achieved by Enhanced 802.11r, respectively. As the number of clients increases, the throughput gap between WGTT and Enhanced 802.11r widens to 2.6× and 2.4× for TCP and UDP transmissions, respectively. This performance disparity is attributed to the dynamic multi-path effects introduced by multiple moving vehicles, leading to a higher packet loss rate. Consequently, the throughput of Enhanced 802.11r drops significantly. In contrast, WGTT benefits from uplink diversity: each Access Point (AP) that overhears an uplink packet forwards it to the server, thereby reducing retransmissions and increasing overall throughput.

### Figure 17: Average Per-Client Downlink Throughput with Different Numbers of Clients

To illustrate this, we plot the average per-client downlink throughput with varying numbers of clients, all moving at 15 mph. The results show that WGTT consistently outperforms Enhanced 802.11r in both TCP and UDP transmissions.

### Packet Loss Rate Analysis

We further analyze the packet loss rate for three clients' uplink UDP flows during their transition among eight APs. We also compare this with the packet loss rate when the client transmits uplink packets through only one AP (Enhanced 802.11r). As shown in Figure 18, with a single uplink, the packet loss rate fluctuates significantly for all three clients. In contrast, with multiple uplinks, the packet loss rate remains very low (below 0.02) for these clients.

### Multiple-Client Scenarios

We test the TCP throughput in three multiple-client scenarios: following driving, parallel driving, and driving in opposite directions, as depicted in Figure 19. In each test, the server sends UDP packets at a constant rate (15 Mb/s) to clients moving at 15 mph. The results, shown in Figure 20, indicate that the highest TCP and UDP throughput is achieved in the scenario where two cars are driving in opposite directions. This is because the clients remain far apart, minimizing link contention. Conversely, the lowest TCP (4.8 Mbits/s) and UDP (5.0 Mbits/s) throughput is observed in the parallel driving case due to higher link contention. Nonetheless, WGTT consistently outperforms Enhanced 802.11r in all three scenarios by leveraging link diversity and reducing packet retransmissions.

### Microbenchmarks

#### 5.3.1 Choosing a Proper Window Size

WGTT uses a time window \( w \) to compare Effective Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ESNR) readings from different APs. To determine the optimal \( w \), we conducted an emulation-based experiment, driving at a constant speed (15 mph) and collecting 10 runs of ESNR data. By varying the window size, we computed the average channel capacity loss. The results, shown in Figure 21, indicate that the capacity loss decreases as the window size increases to 10 ms and then increases beyond that. Based on this, we set \( w \) to 10 ms, achieving minimal channel capacity loss. Further sensitivity analysis at various vehicle speeds confirms this setting.

#### 5.3.2 Link Layer ACK Collision Rate

All APs in the network simultaneously associated with the client reply with link layer acknowledgments after hearing an uplink packet, potentially causing collisions at the client. To measure the frequency of these collisions, we turned off RTS/CTS and sent a constant-rate stream of UDP packets using iperf3, measuring the number of uplink retransmissions. The results, shown in Table 3, indicate that link layer acknowledgment collisions rarely occur, with rates of 0.001% for 70 Mbits/s and 0.004% for 90 Mbits/s. We attribute this to the HT-immediate block ACK with some backoff issued by TP-Link APs, which varies the interval between the last MPDU and block ACK. Given these results, we conclude that such a small fraction of collisions has a minimal impact on WGTT’s throughput.

#### 5.3.3 Impact of Time Hysteresis for AP Switching

We examine the impact of time hysteresis for AP switching on throughput. Varying the time hysteresis from 120 ms to 40 ms, we let a client transit across eight APs to receive TCP packets from the server. The results, shown in Figure 22, indicate that the throughput changes similarly for different time hysteresis settings, with fluctuations due to channel variations but never dropping to zero. Decreasing the time hysteresis from 120 ms to 40 ms gradually increases the throughput from 1.3 Mbits/s to around 6.4 Mbits/s at 2 s. This gain is due to the fast adaptation of the switching algorithm to frequent channel changes at driving speed.

#### 5.3.4 Impact of AP Density

We investigate the impact of AP density on throughput. Varying the driving speed of the client, we measure the UDP throughput in both dense and sparse AP deployment areas. The results, shown in Figure 23, indicate that WGTT achieves consistently high UDP throughput in both sparse and dense AP deployments. The UDP throughput increases from 6.7 Mbits/s to around 9.3 Mbits/s as the client moves from a low-density to a high-density AP area, benefiting from uplink diversity and multiple paths.

### Case Studies

We conduct three real-world case studies to evaluate WGTT's performance in streaming applications: online video streaming, remote video conferencing, and web browsing.

#### Online Video Streaming

In this case study, we test WGTT's ability to reliably stream video to mobile clients. We use the video rebuffer ratio as a key metric to assess the quality of the streaming experience.
