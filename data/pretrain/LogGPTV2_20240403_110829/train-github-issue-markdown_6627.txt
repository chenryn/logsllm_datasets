Two FIXMEs in simpleext: "/* FIXME: handle embedded types and blocks, at least
*/" in `p_t_s_rec` and "FIXME: check duplicates (or just simplify the macro
arg situation)" in `add_new_extension`. I don't pretend to have any
understanding of this code, so that's all I'll say.
The first one at least seems to have been added by @marijnh , so assigning to
him.
