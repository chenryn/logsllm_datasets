##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.7.1
##### Environment:
N/A
##### Summary:
There is a problem when invoking apt with variables.  
When the variables are inside an argument, it gives an error:
    - name: Install chromium browser
      apt: deb=/root/{{item}}.deb
      when: ansible_architecture in ['armv7l']
      with_items:
        - chromium-inspector
        - chromium-browser
Fails:
    TASK: [gui | Install chromium browser] ****************************************
    fatal: [7c669d537a3e] => failed to parse: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/root/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1409662082.8-144889871942361/apt", line 1907, in 
        main()
      File "/root/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1409662082.8-144889871942361/apt", line 523, in main

        pkg = apt.debfile.DebPackage(deb_file)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/debfile.py", line 57, in __init__
        self.open(filename)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/debfile.py", line 66, in open
        self._debfile = apt_inst.DebFile(self.filename)
    SystemError: E:Could not open file /root/chromium-inspector - open (2: No such file or directory), E:Unable to determine the file size - fstat (9: Bad file descriptor), E:Read error - read (9: Bad file descriptor)
    FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting
(note the missing .deb at the end of the filename)
Whereas:
    - name: Install chromium browser
      apt: deb=/root/{{item}}
      when: ansible_architecture in ['armv7l']
      with_items:
        - chromium-inspector.deb
        - chromium-browser.deb
(note moving the .deb filenames inside the array rather than after the
variable on the deb argument)
Succeeds.  
There should NOT be any difference between the runs.  
When trying to find out if it is caused by whitespace I did:
    - name: Install chromium browser
      shell: echo deb=/root/{{item}}.deb
      when: ansible_architecture in ['armv7l']
      with_items:
        - chromium-inspector
        - chromium-browser
Which resulted in:
    changed: [7c669d537a3e] => (item=chromium-inspector) => {"changed": true, "cmd": "echo deb=/root/chromium-inspector.deb", "delta": "0:00:00.035228", "end": "2014-09-02 12:48:54.123722", "item": "chromium-inspector", "rc": 0, "start": "2014-09-02 12:48:54.088494", "stderr": "", "stdout": "deb=/root/chromium-inspector.deb"}
    changed: [7c669d537a3e] => (item=chromium-browser) => {"changed": true, "cmd": "echo deb=/root/chromium-browser.deb", "delta": "0:00:00.017942", "end": "2014-09-02 12:48:56.467385", "item": "chromium-browser", "rc": 0, "start": "2014-09-02 12:48:56.449443", "stderr": "", "stdout": "deb=/root/chromium-browser.deb"}
##### Steps To Reproduce:
See above.
##### Expected Results:
No difference between the runs
##### Actual Results:
Fails when .deb is in the argument line, Succeeds when inside the array.
