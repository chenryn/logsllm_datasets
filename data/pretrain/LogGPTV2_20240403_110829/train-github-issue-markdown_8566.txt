# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
I'm first trying to figure out which piece of software this behavior most
relates to. Here's the ts-loader issue perspective: TypeStrong/ts-loader#1245
This is for webpack 4. There are compatibility issues I have yet to work
through to get as far in Webpack 5.
With Process Monitor on Windows, I'm comparing `tsc --build` to webpack & ts-
loader with and without typechecking. tsc (with typechecking) is a very clear
winner. ts-loader without typechecking or sourcemaps is about 3x duration. ts-
loader WITH typechecking (`transpileOnly: false`) is extremely slow.
The reason that I'm asking about webpack specifically is that file accesses to
.less, .css, .js, and package.json files, for example, are also read hundreds
of times and I don't know if that's expected and unavoidable, or if it perhaps
represents a bug in webpack 4.  
Is webpack responsible for reading package.json files normally? Or is that
100% a loader problem, such as ... Is the ts-loader repeat reads of some files
causing the repeat reads by the loaders of imported non-ts files?

Example sequential repeated reads:

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
Use Sysinternals Process Monitor on Windows to compare ReadFile events between
`tsc` and `webpack` builds of the same code with similar configurations.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Totals and durations should be similar.
