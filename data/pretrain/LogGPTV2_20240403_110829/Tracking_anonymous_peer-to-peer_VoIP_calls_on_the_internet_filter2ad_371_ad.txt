APPENDIX
Let Di (i = 1, . . . , n) represent the random delays added
to packet Pi by the adversary, let D > 0 be the maximum
delay the adversary could add to any packet, and let σ2
d
be the variance of all delays added to all packets. Here
we make no assumption about the distribution of random
delay the adversary could add to each packet except that the
delay is bounded. For example, Di and Dj (i (cid:54)= j) could be
correlated to each other and/or have diﬀerent distributions.
This models all the possible bounded random delays the
adversary could add to a packet ﬂow.
Given the assumption that the adversary does not know
how and which packets are selected by the information hider,
the selection of information embedding packet Pzk (k =
1, . . . , 2r) is independent from any random delay Di the ad-
versary could add. Therefore, the impact of the random de-
lays by the adversary over randomly selected Pzk is equiva-
lent to randomly choosing one from the random variable list:
D1, . . . , Dn. Let bk (k = 1, . . . , 2r) represent the impact of
the random delays by the adversary over the k-th randomly
selected packet Pzk . Apparently the distribution of bk is a
compound one that depends on the probability that each Di
would be selected. Since each Pzk is randomly selected ac-
cording to the same probability distribution over P1, . . . , Pn,
each bk has the same compound distribution. Furthermore,
because each Pzk is selected independently, bk is also inde-
pendent from each other. In other words, the impact of any
random delays by the adversary over those independently
and randomly selected information bearing packets is inde-
pendent and identically distributed (iid ), and it is essentially
an iid random sample from the random delays the adversary
added to all packets.
Let x1,k and x2,k be the random variables that denote
the random impact over ipd1,k,d and ipd2,k,d respectively.
Apparently both x1,k and x2,k are iid.
It is also easy to
see that x1,k, x2,k ∈ [−D, D], E(x1,k) = E(x2,k) = 0, and
d . Let Xk = (x1,k − x2,k)/2,
Var(x1,k) = Var(x2,k) = 2σ2
then Xk is iid, E(Xk) = 0, and Var(Xk) = σ2
d.
k,d be the random variable that denotes the resulting
value of Yk,d after it is perturbed by x1,k and x2,k, then we
have
Let Y (cid:48)

(cid:48)
Y
= (ipd1,k,d − ipd2,k,d)/2 + (x1,k − x2,k)/2
= Yk,d + Xk

Therefore, E(Y (cid:48)
Y (cid:48)
