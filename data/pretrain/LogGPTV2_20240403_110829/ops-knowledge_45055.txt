User: I have a URL address to the audio stream, how I can retranslate it in the web with my address (myapp.appspot.com)?
Let me explain why I need it:
I have a very narrow channel, and will not stand many connections, so I have to do it with GAE
Thanks!
Assistant: You can't make long running external calls with App Engine. Maximum deadline (task queue and cron job handler) for UrlFetch is 10 minutes. So, I think it is not possible.
