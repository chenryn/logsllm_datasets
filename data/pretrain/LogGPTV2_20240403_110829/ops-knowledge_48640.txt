User: I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 64bit.
I don't know what to set on path to application. 
I have installed music21 in anaconda3, but I got output as follows:

music21.converter.subConverters.SubConverterException: Cannot find a valid application path for format midi. Specify this in your Environment by calling environment.set(None, 'pathToApplication')

What application should I choose? I've seen a lot of pages but no one tells me what to set.
Assistant: First of all, are you sure you have a midi player?
Timidity is a good option. Check if you have it installed, and if you doesn't, just use sudo apt-get install timidity
Once installed, the path you need should be  '/usr/bin/timidity'
