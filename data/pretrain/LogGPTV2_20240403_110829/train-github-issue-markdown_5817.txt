I created an extension to port Sublime keybindings to VS Code keybindings. I
made a list of all the key bindings that were missing analogous commands in VS
Code.
Here is the list roughly ordered by importance. Please let me know about more
I missed in the comments. If an extension exists with the functionality I
added it in the far right column.
