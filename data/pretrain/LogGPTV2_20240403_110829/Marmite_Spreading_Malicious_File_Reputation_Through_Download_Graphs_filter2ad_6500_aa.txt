## Abstract
Effective malware detection systems must not only be highly accurate but also robust to changes in the tactics used by cybercriminals. In this paper, we introduce Marmite, a feature-agnostic system designed to propagate the known malicious reputation of certain files to unknown ones, thereby detecting malware. Marmite achieves this by analyzing a global download graph that captures a comprehensive view of how files are downloaded (by which hosts and from which servers). The reputation of files is then propagated across the graph using semi-supervised label propagation with Bayesian confidence. We demonstrate that Marmite achieves high accuracy (0.94 G-mean on average) over a 10-day dataset of 200 million download events. Additionally, we show that Marmite's detection capabilities do not significantly degrade over time, as evidenced by testing our system on a 30-day dataset of 660 million download events collected six months after the initial tuning and validation. Marmite maintains similar accuracy even after this extended period.

## 1. Introduction
The malware ecosystem is continuously evolving, with cybercriminals developing new methods to monetize their malicious software (e.g., ransomware) and more efficient techniques to deliver payloads (e.g., exploit kits and pay-per-install services). They also employ tactics to make their operations more stealthy and resilient, such as Fast Flux and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA).

Traditionally, malware detection relies on static or dynamic analysis, which are prone to evasion and require significant computational resources. Recently, content-agnostic approaches have been proposed, which detect malware without examining the malware sample itself. These methods include analyzing the characteristics of malware delivery infrastructures, topological relations among hosts and IP addresses, proactive crawling of potential malicious hosting sites, and file co-occurrence relationships on infected computers. However, these approaches often rely on features that can change over time due to normal evolution or attempts to evade detection.

To address the challenge of identifying malware in large datasets, we propose Marmite, a principled solution that does not depend on specific tactics or features of malware delivery networks. Instead, Marmite leverages the known reputation of a small number of malicious and benign files and propagates this information to other files that share part of the delivery infrastructure. Marmite first constructs a global download graph, which provides a comprehensive view of file downloads (by which hosts and from which servers). It then performs semi-supervised label propagation with Bayesian confidence to propagate the reputation of known malicious files to unknown ones, allowing for significant and efficient growth in the knowledge of malware samples.

Marmite requires limited ground truth to operate and can grow the initial knowledge of malware with guaranteed linear computational complexity, making it suitable for extremely large-scale datasets. We validate Marmite on a 10-day dataset of 200 million download events, demonstrating high accuracy (0.94 G-mean on average) and the ability to grow our knowledge of malicious samples up to 11 times. We also test Marmite on a 30-day dataset of 660 million download events collected six months after the initial tuning, showing that it retains similar accuracy without the need for re-tuning.

Our analysis reveals idiosyncrasies in malware delivery that can cause systematic false positives. For example, legitimate Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) may deliver malware, tainting benign files. Similarly, malicious files, especially potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), may download legitimate libraries (DLLs), leading to the propagation of bad reputation to these files. We propose a simple whitelist approach to reduce Marmite's false detections and show that a whitelist compiled six months before deployment is effective in significantly reducing the false detection rate.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
- **Marmite System**: A scalable and efficient system based on semi-supervised Bayesian label propagation to propagate the reputation of known files across a global download graph.
- **Validation**: High accuracy (0.94 G-mean) and significant growth in the knowledge of malicious samples using a limited set of known malicious files.
- **Long-Term Efficacy**: Marmite retains its accuracy over time, and a simple whitelisting approach significantly reduces false positives.

## 2. Background and Motivation
### Local vs. Global View of File Distribution
To illustrate the complexity of tracking malware samples across different distribution infrastructures, consider the example in Figure 1. Each graph is built from the local view of one end user's machine, showing two servers delivering malware, each with distinct IP addresses and domains. Each server drops different malicious files to different victim computers, with one file (SHA2: 4B914...) being dropped by both servers.

One solution to flag these files as malware is to blacklist the malicious hosts dropping them, but blacklists often have coverage issues. Another option is to blacklist files as they are observed, for example, by running them in a sandbox. However, malware authors actively try to evade sandbox systems, limiting the effectiveness of this approach.

Previous work has focused on studying file dropping relationships after malicious files are downloaded on victim computers. These approaches build local file dropping graphs extracted from endpoints, extract features from these graphs, and use machine learning algorithms to detect malicious droppers. While effective, these approaches do not provide a global view of the malware delivery ecosystem, leading to limited detection.

In contrast, Marmite takes a global perspective by merging localized information into a comprehensive download graph. This global view allows us to leverage structural information to detect malware when only some files are known to be malicious. By probabilistically propagating labels across the download graph, Marmite can flag additional files as malicious, even if they were initially unknown.

### Example of Download Graph
Figure 2 shows an example of the download graph built by Marmite, obtained by merging the localized information from Figure 1. This graph includes the information that the malicious file identified by SHA2: 4B914... is downloaded by two separate servers. Thanks to this global view, we can propagate the reputation of known malicious files to other files, enhancing the overall detection capability.

In conclusion, Marmite offers a robust and scalable solution for detecting malware by leveraging a global download graph and semi-supervised label propagation, ensuring high accuracy and long-term efficacy.
