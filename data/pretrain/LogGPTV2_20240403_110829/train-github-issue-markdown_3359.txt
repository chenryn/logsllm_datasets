I see that the libraries are using viewless Fragments to do work. This creates
a problem where under some circumstance, would conflict with other fragment
transactions that fragment manager is doing  
The full stacktrace:
     java.lang.IllegalStateException: Recursive entry to executePendingTransactions
            at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.execPendingActions(FragmentManager.java:1457)
            at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.executePendingTransactions(FragmentManager.java:482)
            at com.bumptech.glide.manager.RequestManagerRetriever.supportFragmentGet(RequestManagerRetriever.java:148)
            at com.bumptech.glide.manager.RequestManagerRetriever.get(RequestManagerRetriever.java:66)
            at com.bumptech.glide.manager.RequestManagerRetriever.get(RequestManagerRetriever.java:29)
            at com.bumptech.glide.Glide.with(Glide.java:537)
A perfect example of this would be an `ViewPager` containing several Fragments
that calls Glide at the very beginning of `onCreateView`.
