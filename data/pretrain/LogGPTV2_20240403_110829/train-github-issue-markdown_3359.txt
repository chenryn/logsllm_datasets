I have observed that the libraries are employing viewless Fragments to perform certain tasks. This approach can lead to conflicts with other fragment transactions managed by the `FragmentManager` under specific circumstances.

### Issue Description
The problem manifests as an `IllegalStateException` with the message "Recursive entry to executePendingTransactions". Here is the full stack trace:

```java
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Recursive entry to executePendingTransactions
    at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.execPendingActions(FragmentManager.java:1457)
    at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.executePendingTransactions(FragmentManager.java:482)
    at com.bumptech.glide.manager.RequestManagerRetriever.supportFragmentGet(RequestManagerRetriever.java:148)
    at com.bumptech.glide.manager.RequestManagerRetriever.get(RequestManagerRetriever.java:66)
    at com.bumptech.glide.manager.RequestManagerRetriever.get(RequestManagerRetriever.java:29)
    at com.bumptech.glide.Glide.with(Glide.java:537)
```

### Example Scenario
A typical scenario where this issue can occur is when a `ViewPager` contains several Fragments, and Glide is called at the very beginning of the `onCreateView` method. This can cause the `FragmentManager` to enter a recursive state, leading to the `IllegalStateException`.

### Recommendations
To avoid this issue, consider the following best practices:
1. **Delay Glide Calls**: Postpone the Glide call until after the Fragment's view has been fully created and added to the `FragmentManager`.
2. **Use Lifecycle-Aware Components**: Ensure that Glide calls are made in a lifecycle-aware manner, such as within `onStart` or `onResume` methods.
3. **Check for Pending Transactions**: Before calling `executePendingTransactions`, check if there are any pending transactions to avoid recursion.

By following these recommendations, you can mitigate the risk of encountering the `IllegalStateException` and ensure smoother fragment management.
