INTRODUCTION 
II.  THIS YEAR’S WORKSHOP 
computer-based 
information 
systems, 
The  5th  Workshop  on  Recent  Advances  in  Intrusion-
Tolerant Systems, held in conjunction with DSN 2011, aims to 
continue  the  collaborative  discourse  on  the  challenges  of 
building  intrusion-tolerant  systems  and  innovative  ideas  to 
address them.  
systems  are 
Modern  computer  based 
increasingly 
distributed  and  increasingly  interconnected  with  multiple 
disparate  systems  both  physically  as  well  as  a  semantically. 
This  leads  to  vulnerabilities  and  weak  points  that  remain 
waiting to be discovered and exploited. In the recent days, we 
have read numerous accounts of such exploits including high 
profile  breaches  at  RSA  and  Sony  on  line  gaming  network. 
The  idea  of  intrusion  tolerance  is  based  on  the  premise  that 
design, implementation and operational flaws are inevitable in 
modern 
and 
acknowledges  that  it  is  impossible  to  completely  prevent  or 
accurately  detect  attacks  and  intrusion.    Intrusion  tolerance 
seeks  to  devise  technology  and  techniques  that  can  enable 
distributed  and  networked  information  systems  continue  to 
operate  through  such  attacks  and  provide  some  level  of 
service. In that sense, Intrusion Tolerance as a technical area 
can  be  thought  of  at  the  intersection  of  Fault  Tolerance  and 
Security,  with  emphasis  on  dynamic  and  adaptive  behavior 
because  unlike  fault  tolerance,  intrusion  tolerance  faces  an 
intelligent  adversary  -  no  statistical  pattern  of  failure  can  be 
assumed, and without adaptation, the system is doomed to fail. 
Having focused on intrusion tolerance technologies in the 
past workshops and having substantiated intrusion tolerance as 
a  practical  discipline  that  combines  software  engineering, 
adaptive  system  development,  advanced  reasoning  and 
analyses,  and  coordination  and  control  of  distributed 
mechanisms and resources, this year’s workshop is especially 
interested  in  "evaluating  intrusion-tolerance":  How  to  assess 
the  assurance  conferred  by  intrusion  tolerance  technologies, 
and  “the  overlap  of  intrusion  tolerance  and  emerging 
information  technologies”:  how  emerging  technologies  like 
Web  2.0,  semantic  web  systems,  clouds  and  service-oriented 
architectures challenge or enhance intrusion tolerance.  
The 5th edition of WRAITS features a keynote address by 
Michel Cukier and a collection of 7 exciting research papers. 
The keynote discusses how cybersecurity data (e.g., incidents, 
intrusion detection system alerts, network flows and malicious 
activity against a large range of honeypots) can be analyzed to 
evaluate the security of organizational networks. 
In  Continuous  Mission-Oriented  Assessment  (CMA)  of 
Assurance  Hurley  et  al.  presents  an  innovative  approach  to 
assess the assurance provided by intrusion-tolerant systems at 
run  time.    The  second  paper  focusing  on  assessment  of 
intrusion  tolerance  is  Combining  Intrusion  Detection  and 
Recovery  for  Enhancing  System  Dependability  by  Nagarajan 
et al. In this paper, they take on the important issue of how to 
decide  and  choose  one  intrusion  tolerance  scheme  over 
another  and  a  present  a  ROC  curve  based  approach  that 
considers, among other things, the cost to the system owners 
of successful intrusions and breaches. 
Speaking  about  cost,  Zonouz  et  al  presents  the  cost  of 
managing  enterprise  system  in  the  presence  of  attacks  in  a 
game-theoretic  format  in  their  paper  entitled  Managing 
Business Health in the Presence of Malicious Attacks. 
With respect to the overlap between intrusion tolerance and 
emerging  system  and  software  engineering  technologies,  the 
paper  The  Time-Free  Approach 
to  Byzantine  Failure 
Detection  in  Dynamic  Networks  by  Lima  et  al  considers 
detection  of  corrupt  behavior  in  applications  deployed  in 
wireless  and  ad-hoc  networks.    A  second  paper,  A  Cloud-
Based  Intrusion  Detection  and  Response  System  for  Mobile 
Phones by Houmansadr et al considers the emerging threat of 
intrusions and attacks on mobile phones and using concepts in 
cloud  computing  to  detect  such  incidents.  In  Anomaly-Based 
Intrusion Detection in Software as a Service, Nascimento et al 
discuss an n-gram based anomaly detection technique for large 
web-based  systems,  the  kind  that  are  becoming  routine  in 
many enterprises. 
Finally,  in  From  Byzantine  Fault  Tolerance  to  Intrusion 
Tolerance  Bessani  traces  the  paths  and  connections  between 
Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Intrusion Tolerance.
