User: How to achieve load balancing to deal with high traffic load?
Assistant: There are many ways to achieve load balancing, and some common methods are listed below: 1. Hardware load balancer: Using a hardware load balancer, traffic can be effectively distributed to multiple servers to achieve the purpose of load balancing. 2. Software load balancer: use software load balancer, such as Nginx, HAProxy, etc., to allow servers to share traffic, that is, distribute traffic to different servers to achieve load balancing. 3. DNS load balancing: through the DNS server, the domain name is resolved to the IP addresses of multiple servers, so that the traffic is distributed to multiple servers to achieve the effect of load balancing. 4. Session sharing: Using session sharing technology, sessions on multiple servers can be shared together, thereby avoiding the inconsistency of sessions between multiple servers. 5. CDN acceleration: Using CDN can store dynamic and static resources separately, cache static resources on CDN nodes, reduce the traffic load of the origin site, and improve user access speed at the same time. The above methods can be used alone or in combination to achieve load balancing under high traffic loads.
