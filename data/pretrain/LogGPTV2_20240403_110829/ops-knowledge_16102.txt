User: I am trying to read a dicom header tag in dicom file. 
 Now, there are two ways to read this dicom header tag. 
1) Using pydicom package in python which apparently is not working well on my python installed version(python 3).
2) or when i call AFNI function 'dicom_hinfo' through command line, i can get dicom tag value. The syntax to call afni function in terminal is as follows:
dicom_hinfo -tag aaaa,bbbb filename.dcm
output:fgre
Now how should i call this dicom-info -tag aaaa,bbbb filename.dcm in python script.
I guess subprocess might work but not sure about how to use it in this case.
Assistant: Oh this was due to syntax error using Pydicom. 
I wanted to access 0019, 109c tag. 
Syntax should be:
ds[0x0019,0x109c].value. 
not ds[aaaa,bbbb].value
