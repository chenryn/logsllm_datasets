User: Is there a command line switch to carry out the script specified without terminating the process at the end?
Windows' cmd.exe for example has the /K switch.
Assistant: As stated on python's manual:

-i switch
When a script is passed as first argument or the -c option is used, enter interactive mode after executing the script.
