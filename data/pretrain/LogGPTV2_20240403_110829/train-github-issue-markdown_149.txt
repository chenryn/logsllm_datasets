Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

An error (TS2342) is reported when the indexer is a union type, such as `string | number`:

```typescript
var a: number | string;
var b: any;
var c = b[a];  // Error: TS2342
```

In this example, the variable `a` is of type `number | string`, which causes the TypeScript compiler to raise an error when used as an indexer for `b`.

This version is clearer, more structured, and provides a better explanation of the issue.
