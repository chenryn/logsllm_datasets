# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18945.1001
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.3.2142.0
    Any other software?
    Reproduced using Debian Buster; also, font in use in both Terminal and console is Consolas.
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Ensure that you are configured to use the UTF-8 locale and UTF-8 codeset; i.e., that the output of the `locale` command is as follows:
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8                                                                                                                                            LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8                                                                                                                                        LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                      LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                    LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                       LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                    LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                   LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                   LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                      LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                       LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                    LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                  LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                                LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"                                                                                                                             LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 
  2. Run `pstree`, or another command which detects and uses UTF-8 line-drawing characters.
Note that this is not the default configuration of Debian for the en_US.UTF-8
locale, which leaves LC_ALL set to C; `sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
is required.
# Expected behavior
# Actual behavior
Expected behavior is line-drawing characters, as seen in console on the right.
Actual behavior is all such characters rendering as "underline", as seen in
Terminal on the left.
