**ATT&CK ID:** S0570  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** BitPaymer

BitPaymer can bypass User Account Control (UAC) prompts by modifying specific registry keys. On Windows 10, it sets the `HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command` key, while on Windows 7, it modifies the `HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command` key. After making these changes, BitPaymer launches the `eventvwr.msc` process, which in turn executes BitPaymer with elevated privileges.[15]

### Summary:
- **Registry Keys Modified:**
  - **Windows 10:** `HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`
  - **Windows 7:** `HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command`
- **Execution Mechanism:** Launches `eventvwr.msc` to execute BitPaymer with elevated privileges.

This method allows BitPaymer to run with higher privileges without triggering UAC prompts, thereby evading detection and user intervention.
