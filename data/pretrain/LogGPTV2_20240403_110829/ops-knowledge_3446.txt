I have a long-running daily cron job on OpenShift that takes a couple of hours to complete. I've added `nohup` and am running it in the background, but it still seems to time out after the default 5 minutes. The job runs correctly for this initial period, and I receive no errors. It also works perfectly fine when run locally.

Here is the command I am using:

```bash
nohup python ${OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR}wsgi/manage.py do_something >> \
  ${OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR}do_something_data.log 2> \
  ${OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR}do_something_error.log &
```

I have been informed that the 5-minute limit applies to free accounts and includes all background processes. I asked a similar question on Stack Overflow.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
