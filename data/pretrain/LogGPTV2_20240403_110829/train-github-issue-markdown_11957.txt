I know there is a similar issue (#1954) but it is related with
Squirrel.Windows and Windows 10. This problem is also on Windows 7 and
**Squirrel.Windows** shouldn't be needed for pinning an application.

  * `app.setAppUserModelId('electron.app.AppName')` doesn't make any difference.
  * This is happening when I drag (as in the gif above) the .exe to the taskbar and then I try to run it. If I execute the app first and then pin the running instance, the pinned app will work correctly.
