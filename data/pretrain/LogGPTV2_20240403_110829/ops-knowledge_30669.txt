User: I'm testing some python code that parses command line input. Is there a way to pass this input in through IDLE? Currently I'm saving in the IDLE editor and running from a command prompt.
I'm running Windows.
Assistant: IDLE now has a GUI way to add arguments to sys.argv! Under the 'Run' menu header select 'Run... Customized' or just Shift+F5...A dialog will appear and that's it!
