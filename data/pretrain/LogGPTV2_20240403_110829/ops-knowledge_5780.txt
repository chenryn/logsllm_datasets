The provided system log excerpt, spanning from 19:46 to 19:51 on December 4, 2005, contains a series of notices and errors related to the initialization of a worker environment for Apache HTTPD server using the mod_jk module. Here is a step-by-step summary:

1. **Initialization Successes**:
   - At `19:46:20` and `19:50:51`, the `workerEnv.init()` function successfully initializes the environment using the configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf/workers2.properties`.
   - The `jk2_init()` function identifies and logs the presence of multiple child processes (IDs 1833, 1832, 1834, 1835, 1836, and 1837) in various scoreboard slots at different times (`19:50:39`, `19:50:57`, `19:51:43`, and `19:51:52`).

2. **Recurring Errors**:
   - Repeatedly, at `19:46:20`, `19:50:55`, `19:51:18`, and `19:51:54`, the log reports that the `mod_jk` child `workerEnv` is in an error state with code `6`. This indicates a persistent issue with the `mod_jk` child process.

In summary, the log shows successful initializations of the worker environment and the identification of child processes, but it also highlights a recurring error with the `mod_jk` child process, which consistently enters an error state.
