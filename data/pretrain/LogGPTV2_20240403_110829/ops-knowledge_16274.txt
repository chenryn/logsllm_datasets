User: I wanted to know if there is a way to find out the status of the ssh server in the system using Python. I just want to know if the server is active or not (just yes/no). It would help even if it is just a linux command so that I can use python's popen from subprocess module and run that command.
Thanks
PS: I'm using openssh-server on linux (ubuntu 12.04)
Assistant: Run service sshd status (e.g. via Popen()) and read what it tells you.
