User: Hey I want to create a bash-shell in wxPython, the only thing it should be able to do is run a python file and be able to offer user_input on the fly.
(I know there is a Python Shell, but that is something different)
Can someone help me with this? thanks in advance
Assistant: Maybe pyCrust plus the Python debugger?
