User: How to use Linux command line tools to compress and decompress files?
Assistant: Linux command line tools can use the following commands to compress and decompress files: 1. Compress files: - gzip command: Use the gzip command to compress a single file, and automatically add the .gz extension to the original file. For example: `gzip filename.txt` compresses the filename.txt file. - tar command: Use the tar command to package multiple files or folders into a single tar file and compress it. For example: `tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /path/to/folder` packs and compresses all files and subfolders in the path/to/folder folder. 2. Decompress the file: - gunzip command: Use the gunzip command to decompress the gzip compressed file. For example: `gunzip filename.txt.gz` decompresses filename.txt.gz. - tar command: Use the tar command to decompress tar compressed files. For example: `tar -xvzf archive.tar.gz` extracts a tar archive named archive.tar.gz. The above are the basic commands for compressing and decompressing files for Linux command line tools. For more detailed parameters and options, please refer to the help documentation of the command.
