User: How to monitor the server's system resource usage (such as CPU, memory and disk space), and report the data to the monitoring system?
Assistant: Various system monitoring tools can be used to monitor the system resource usage of the server, for example: 1. top: It is a command of Unix and Linux systems, which can monitor the system CPU, memory and process usage in real time. 2. vmstat: It can monitor the CPU, memory, disk IO and other resource usage of the Linux system, and output detailed reports. 3. sar: It can monitor the CPU, memory, disk IO, network and other resource usage of the Linux system, and save the data in the system log. 4. Nagios: It is an open source network monitoring system that can monitor the usage of system resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space of various servers, and report the data to the administrator. 5. Zabbix: It is also an open source network monitoring system, which can monitor the CPU, memory, disk space and other system resource usage of various servers, and provides a variety of reporting and alarm functions. It should be noted that different monitoring tools may have different monitoring methods and accuracy for system resource usage, and it is necessary to select the appropriate tool for specific needs and environments. At the same time, it is also necessary to configure the monitoring system reasonably to avoid the impact of too many monitoring tasks on system performance.
