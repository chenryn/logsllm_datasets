User: In Linux, we usually add a shebang in a script to invoke the respective interpreter. I tried the following example.
I wrote a shell script without a shebang and with executable permission. I was able to execute it using ./. But if I write a similar python program, without shebang, I am not able to execute it.
Why is this so? As far as my understanding, shebang is required to find the interpreter. So how does shell scripts work, but not a python script?
Assistant: shell scripts will only work if you are in the shell you targeted ... there is not python shell ... as such python will never work without explicity calling python (via shebang or command line)
