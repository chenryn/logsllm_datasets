I have been searching for information on this topic, but I haven't found much. I am using macOS and would like to compile a command-line Python script into a small command-line application that I can place in `/usr/local/bin` so that I can call it from anywhere. Is there a straightforward way to achieve this?

Thank you.

**Response:**

Certainly! The simplest way to do this is to follow these steps:

1. **Rename the File:**
   - Rename your Python script from `filename.py` to `filename`.

2. **Add Shebang Line:**
   - Add the following shebang line at the top of your file to specify the Python interpreter:
     ```python
     #!/usr/bin/env python
     ```

3. **Set Executable Permissions:**
   - Make the file executable by running the following command in the terminal:
     ```sh
     chmod +x filename
     ```

4. **Move the File:**
   - Move the file to `/usr/local/bin` so that you can call it from anywhere:
     ```sh
     mv filename /usr/local/bin/
     ```

After completing these steps, you should be able to run your script by simply typing `filename` in the terminal from any directory.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
