## Abstract
Modern web services are inevitably subject to abuse as attackers find ways to exploit these services and their user bases. While defending against such abuse is typically considered a technical challenge, we argue that human labor markets play an increasingly significant role. Using over seven years of data from the popular crowdsourcing site Freelancer.com, as well as data from our own active job solicitations, we characterize the labor market involved in service abuse. We identify the largest classes of abuse work, including account creation, social networking link generation, and search engine optimization (SEO) support, and analyze how pricing and demand have evolved to support this activity.

## 1. Introduction
Today’s online web services—such as search engines and social networks—create value for users by helping them find and interact with content generated by other users. These services often rely on advertising for revenue, but their open access and reliance on user-generated content create opportunities for abusers to fabricate secondary, extremely cheap advertising channels. This results in well-known issues like webmail spam, polluted search results, and fake friend requests, collectively termed "service abuse." These activities exploit features of public services for financial gain at the expense of the service provider.

Each web service provider aims to prevent such activities to preserve the value of their advertising enterprise. To this end, most websites include extensive terms of service that limit how their services may be used. However, implicit threats of legal action rarely deter attackers, and providers must rely on a broad range of defenses and countermeasures to enforce their terms. While the technical details of this "arms race" are interesting, they are ultimately symptoms of a larger struggle over who can monetize access to a site’s users.

In this paper, we do not focus on the underlying technical attacks but rather explore the human labor markets where these capabilities are provided. There are vibrant markets for abuse-oriented services, and within minutes, one can buy a thousand phone-verified Gmail accounts for $300 or a thousand Facebook "friends" for $26. Much of this activity occurs on freelance work sites, where buyers post jobs and globally distributed workers bid on projects.

There are several advantages to this approach:
1. Many anti-abuse countermeasures are designed to detect or deter mechanistic automation and can be bypassed through low-cost human labor. For example, CAPTCHAs, which are human-solvable puzzles, can be solved by aggregating large amounts of cheap human labor.
2. The crowdsourcing medium allows innovative attackers to quickly explore different schemes for evading anti-abuse defenses due to the agility of a large contract labor pool.
3. Once a new attack scheme becomes popular enough to commoditize, competitive pressures drive workers to develop the most efficient means of satisfying the demand. Eventually, the most popular activities, such as CAPTCHA solving or phone-verified accounts, can support their own branded retail services outside the spot labor market.

In this paper, we characterize the abuse-related labor on Freelancer.com, one of the largest and most popular freelancer sites. Using almost seven years of historical data and a range of our own contemporary work solicitations, we examine four classes of jobs:
- Account registration and verification
- SEO content and link generation
- Ad posting and bulk mailing
- Social network linking

Each of these represents a kind of service abuse, incorporating manual labor to bypass existing controls, and each is ultimately a building block in some larger, economically-driven, advertising enterprise.

## 2. Background
Outsourcing has long been a cost-cutting strategy in developed economies, pushing key business processes to third-party service providers. A more recent innovation is "crowdsourcing," which further unbundles labor from structured organizations and leverages the broad connectivity provided by the Internet. In this model, individuals participate in the labor force as free agents, responding to open calls for work on a piecework basis. Fee-based crowdsourcing sites, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, have emerged, where employers post requests for service at a particular price, and laborers can "solve" the subset of requests that appeal to them.

However, crowdsourcing presents several concerns. First, it is controversial as an employment vehicle, as critics claim its pure free-market approach to labor can be highly exploitative, particularly of those in developing countries. Second, even on the employer side, crowdsourcing can be problematic since, absent any strong reputation mechanism, there may be little incentive for workers to provide quality work-products. Consequently, third-party services, such as CrowdFlower, have emerged to trade cost for data quality by replicating work requests and voting among them.

A less appreciated negative impact of this ecosystem is how anonymous access to cheap aggregated labor impacts the security of existing internet services. Indeed, as we show in this paper, the crowdsourced market for web service abuse labor is thriving.

Much of this activity takes place on "freelancing" sites, where employers post jobs and select individual workers based on their bids and bilateral negotiation. Popular freelancing sites include Freelancer, Elance, RentACoder, Guru, and oDesk. In this paper, we specifically examine the activity at Freelancer.com, one of the oldest and largest sites, claiming roughly two million employers and workers from 234 different geographic regions, with close to nine hundred thousand projects posted since 2004. We chose Freelancer because the site offers an open API for querying information about past jobs and users. We have also gathered smaller amounts of data from other large freelancer sites, but since the activity is extremely similar across sites, we focused on the one for which our data was comprehensive.

Visitors to Freelancer must register and select a handle by which they are visible to other users. The only due diligence concerning a user’s identity is a requirement to have a valid email address. The site offers "skills tests" for a fee, by which individual users may demonstrate proficiency in various skills and earn "badges" visible on their profile. There is no discrimination between employers and workers, and any user can participate on either or both sides of the labor market.

To post a project on the site, the project poster, or buyer, must pay a $5 fee, which is refunded once a worker is selected. Buyers may choose to pay an additional fee of $14 to have their jobs "featured," meaning they are listed towards the top of the job listings. Workers independently scan these job listings to find projects matching their skill sets and then place bids. Buyers then select the workers who are most appropriate for their tasks. Once workers are chosen, Freelancer charges either $3 or 3% of the total project cost to the buyers, depending on whichever amount is higher. However, some less scrupulous buyers are reputed to simply cancel their orders and settle with workers out-of-band. Finally, while job postings are effectively "broadcast," some posts identify themselves as private by specifically identifying the workers they are interested in employing.

## 3. Data Overview
In this section, we describe our methodology for collecting data on Freelancer job activity and categorizing the jobs into various kinds of "dirty" tasks.

### 3.1 Data Collection Methodology
Freelancer.com provides an API for programmatically querying information regarding projects and users. Using this API, we implemented a crawler to collect both contemporary and historical information about Freelancer activity. We ran the crawler from December 16, 2010, through April 6, 2011, to minimize load on the site. For historical data, we observed that Freelancer uses monotonically increasing IDs for both projects and users. To crawl all projects over time, we iterated through the entire available project ID space, which at the time ranged from 1 to 1,015,634. As a result, the job postings in our dataset represent all the jobs viewable through the API. We derived the set of user IDs based upon the set of projects, including any user associated with a project as a buyer, bidder, or worker.

For all crawled projects, we extracted the project details and corresponding project bids, as well as the buyer, bidders, and selected workers who were awarded the projects (if any). For all users, we downloaded their public account metadata and feedback comments.

### 3.2 Data Summary
Starting with the earliest project posted on February 5, 2004, at 12:28 EST, we collected data through April 6, 2011, capturing over seven years of activity. Table 1 summarizes this dataset. During this time, 842,199 jobs were posted to Freelancer, and 815,709 users were active on the site. Roughly 46% of the posted jobs reported a worker selected for the job. This number represents a lower bound on the number of job transactions; a buyer and a worker will sometimes use Freelancer to rendezvous but will negotiate the transaction through private messaging and, thus, never report a selected worker. Among all users associated with at least one project, 22.1% were buyers only, 72.4% were bidders/workers only, and 5.5% served as both.

| Activity | Projects | Projects w/ Selected Workers | Project Bids | Active Users | Buyers Only | Workers Only | Buyer & Workers |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Count    | 842,199  | 388,733                     | 12,656,978   | 815,709      | 179,908     | 590,806      | 44,995          |
| %        | 100%     | 46%                         | 100%         | 100%         | 22.1%       | 72.4%        | 5.5%            |

Figure 1 shows the growth in Freelancer activity over time. The curves all show a drop in activity in December 2006 (the reason for which we have not been able to determine). After this point, Freelancer experiences strong linear growth in buyers and bidders and their associated posting and bidding activity. The job market is healthy and growing, with a steadily increasing number of buyers (5,000 new buyers a month on average in 2010) and an equally steady increase in the supply of bidders (15,000 new bidders/month).

### 3.3 Categorizing Jobs
Our first step in understanding Freelancer activity is to categorize the types of jobs found on the site. We use a two-step process for this categorization. We first manually browse sampled projects to identify a meaningful list of job categories. We then use a combination of keyword matching and supervised learning to identify jobs from the entire Freelancer corpus that fall into the categories.

From browsing random job postings, gauging the interest level in various tasks from observed bidding activity, and incorporating awareness of the larger underground cybercrime ecosystem, we identified 22 types of jobs falling into six categories. To establish a baseline of the prevalence of these types of jobs, we manually inspected a random sample of 2,000 jobs, tagging each job with a category.

Table 2 summarizes the list of categories and the distribution of jobs that fall into each category from our random sample. Note that a job may be tagged under multiple categories; for example, social bookmarking jobs for SEO usually also require account creation. Legitimate projects comprise 65.4% of these jobs and primarily involve web-related programming and content creation tasks. We include private jobs, corresponding to projects targeted to one specific user, in the legitimate job class, since we typically do not know their exact nature.
