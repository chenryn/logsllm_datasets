# Introduction to Lockpicking
## Alek Amrani
### DEF CON 17

## About Me
- Longhorn Lockpicking Club
- UT Austin ISO
- Computer Science Undergraduate

## Format
- **First Year with Thursday Events**
- **Extended Time Slot**: Attendees may come and go, so the session will be divided into three parts.
- **Originally Planned as a Hands-On Workshop**: Unfortunately, the bag containing the necessary tools (picks and locks) was lost. 
- **LSI / LLC Event**: The format has been adapted to include:
  - **Teaching Lockpicking Theory**: This will help attendees appreciate the Lockpicking Village.
  - **Entertainment**: A demonstration lock will be built using materials found within walking distance. Construction began at 11:30 AM on July 30, 2009. While it may not look great, it is functional.
  - **Revised PowerPoint Presentation**

## Preliminary Q&A
- Are there any questions before we begin?
- If not, let's get started.

## Lockpicking Background
- **Why Lockpicking?**
- **Why "Hacking"?**: The motivations are similar.
- **Groups**:
  - Locksport International (LSI)
  - The Open Organization Of Lockpickers (TOOOL)
  - Longhorn Lockpicking Club (LLC)
  - Fraternal Organization Of Locksport (FOOLs)
  - Other groups exist as well.

## Legality
- **Check Local Laws**: Generally, it is legal to pick your own locks or those for which you have explicit permission.
- **Carrying Lockpicks**: In some places, such as New York City and Washington DC, carrying lockpicks can be illegal.
- **Disclaimer**: I am not familiar with the specific laws in your area, so please verify them independently.

## Types of Locks
- **Classification**:
  - **Security Level**: This is a somewhat arbitrary grouping.
  - **Operation**:
    - Electronic
    - Mechanical
    - Electromechanical
  - **Housing**: This is usually self-evident.

## Pin Tumbler Locks
- **Focus**: We will primarily discuss pin tumbler locks.
- **Components**:
  - **Housing** (Green)
  - **Plug** (Yellow)
  - **Driver Pins** (Blue)
  - **Key Pins** (Red)
  - **Shear Line**: The point where the plug meets the housing.

### How Pin Tumbler Locks Work
- **Key Interaction**:
  - **Peaks and Valleys on Key**: These raise the pins.
  - **Correct Key**: Raises the top of the key pins to the shear line.
  - **Wrong Key**: Puts the pins at the wrong height.

### How to Pick a Pin Tumbler Lock
- **Mechanism**: The lock opens when the key is inserted, raising the pins to the correct height.
- **Lockpicking**: If we can raise the pins to the correct height, we don't need the key.

### Techniques
- **Single Pin Picking**:
  - **Hooks**
- **Multiple Pin Manipulation**:
  - **Rakes**

### Security Features
- **Security Pins**:
  - Spool
  - Mushroom
  - Serrated
- **Sidebars**
