Legality
● Check local laws
● In general, but not always, it is usually ok to pick 
your own locks, or locks you have explicit 
permission to pick
● It is not always ok to Cary lockpicks
– EX: NYC and Washington DC
● I have no idea what the laws in your particular 
location are.

Pin Tumbler Locks
● How do we lockpick?
● The lock opens when the key is inserted, which 
raises the pins to the correct height.
● If we can raise the pins to the correct height, we 
don't need the key.
