Question: Consider a software design where you are tasked to implement a class hierarchy for a graphics library. The base class is 'Shape', which will be extended by 'Circle', 'Rectangle', and 'Triangle'. You need to ensure that the 'Shape' class adheres to proper object-oriented design principles and does not introduce potential vulnerabilities. Which of the following modifications to the 'Shape' class would be most appropriate?
"A": "The 'Shape' class defines an instance method that casts itself to 'Circle' to calculate the area.",
"B": "The 'Shape' class declares an abstract method 'calculateArea' to be overridden by child classes.",
"C": "The 'Shape' class keeps a static reference to a 'Triangle' object to use its 'calculatePerimeter' method.",
"D": "The 'Shape' class initializes a 'Rectangle' object in its constructor to delegate the 'draw' operation."
Answer: B
