### Attachment Points for Filters
| Filter Attachment Point | Interface Type | Mirrored Packet Layer 2 Header |
|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Input                   | Any Ethernet except `gr-` and `fti-` | Layer 2 header of the incoming packet is reported |
| Output                  | Any Ethernet except `gr-` and `fti-` | Layer 2 header of the incoming packet is reported |
| Input or Output         | `gr-` interface | Not supported |
| Input                   | `fti-` interface | Incoming Layer 2 header of the original packet (as it was seen on the WAN port) |
| Output                  | `fti-` interface | Incoming Layer 2 header of the original packet (as it was seen on the WAN port) |
| Input                   | `irb` interface | Incoming Layer 2 header of the original packet (as it was seen on the WAN port) |
| Output                  | `irb` interface | Not supported |

### Suggestions for Enhancements to Your Packet-Filtering Configuration
To enhance your filter network telemetry setup, consider using `input-chain` and `output-chain` filters to separate the configuration used for mirroring from existing filters. This approach helps avoid inadvertent configuration errors during troubleshooting. For more details, refer to "Example: Using Firewall Filter Chains."

### Troubleshooting Port Mirroring

### Egress Port Mirroring with VLAN Translation
#### In This Section
- Problem
- Solution

**Problem:**
If you configure a port-mirroring setup to mirror customer VLAN (CVLAN) traffic on egress and the traffic undergoes VLAN translation before being mirrored, the VLAN translation does not apply to the mirrored packets. The mirrored packets retain the service VLAN (SVLAN) tag, which should be replaced by the CVLAN tag on egress. The original packets are unaffected; VLAN translation works properly, and the SVLAN tag is replaced with the CVLAN tag on egress.

**Solution:**
This is expected behavior. For more information, see "Understanding Q-in-Q Tunneling and VLAN Translation."

### Egress Port Mirroring with Private VLANs
#### In This Section
- Problem
- Solution

**Problem:**
If you create a port-mirroring configuration that mirrors private VLAN (PVLAN) traffic on egress, the mirrored traffic (sent to the analyzer system) has the VLAN tag of the ingress VLAN instead of the egress VLAN. For example, assume the following PVLAN configuration:
- Promiscuous trunk port carrying primary VLANs `pvlan100` and `pvlan400`.
- Isolated access port carrying secondary VLAN `isolated200`, which is a member of primary VLAN `pvlan100`.
- Community port carrying secondary VLAN `comm300`, which is also a member of primary VLAN `pvlan100`.
- Output interface (monitor interface) connecting to the analyzer system, forwarding the mirrored traffic to the analyzer.

If a packet for `pvlan100` enters on the promiscuous trunk port and exits on the isolated access port, the original packet is untagged on egress because it is exiting on an access port. However, the mirror copy retains the tag for `pvlan100` when sent to the analyzer.

Another example: If a packet for `comm300` ingresses on the community port and egresses on the promiscuous trunk port, the original packet carries the tag for `pvlan100` on egress, as expected. However, the mirrored copy retains the tag for `comm300` when sent to the analyzer.

**Solution:**
This is expected behavior.

### Troubleshooting Port Mirroring Configuration Error Messages
#### In This Section
- An Analyzer Configuration Returns a “Multiple interfaces cannot be configured as a member of Analyzer output VLAN” Error Message

**Problem:**
In an analyzer configuration, if the VLAN to which mirrored traffic is sent contains more than one member interface, the following error message is displayed in the CLI when you commit the analyzer configuration, and the commit fails:
```
Multiple interfaces cannot be configured as a member of Analyzer output VLAN
```

**Solution:**
You must direct the mirrored traffic to a VLAN that has a single member interface. You can do this by:
- Reconfiguring the existing VLAN to contain a single member interface.
- Creating a new VLAN with a single member interface and associating the VLAN with the analyzer.

**To reconfigure the existing VLAN to contain only one member interface:**
1. Remove member interfaces from the VLAN repeatedly using either the `delete vlan` command or the `delete interface` command until the VLAN contains a single member interface:
   - `[edit]`
     ```plaintext
     user@switch# delete vlan vlan-id interface interface-name
     ```
   - `[edit]`
     ```plaintext
     user@switch# delete interface interface-name unit 0 family family-name vlan member vlan-id
     ```
2. (Optional) Confirm that the VLAN contains only one interface:
   - `[edit]`
     ```plaintext
     user@switch# show vlans vlan-name
     ```
   The output for this command must display only one interface.

**To create a new VLAN with a single member interface:**
1. Configure a VLAN to carry the mirrored traffic:
   - `[edit]`
     ```plaintext
     user@switch# set vlans vlan-name
     ```
2. Associate an interface with the VLAN:
   - `[edit]`
     ```plaintext
     user@switch# set interfaces interface-name unit logical-unit-number family family-name vlan members vlan-name
     ```
3. Associate the VLAN with the analyzer:
   - `[edit ethernet-switching-options]`
     ```plaintext
     user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output vlan vlan-name
     ```

### Overview of System Logging
#### Summary
This section describes the system log messages generated by Junos OS processes, identifying the process responsible and providing a brief description of the operation or error. It covers:
- Routine operations
- Failure and error conditions
- Emergency or critical conditions

#### System Log Overview
Junos OS generates system log messages (also called syslog messages) to record events, including:
- Routine operations (e.g., creation of an OSPF protocol adjacency or a user login to the configuration database)
- Failure and error conditions (e.g., failure to access a configuration file or unexpected closure of a connection to a peer process)
- Emergency or critical conditions (e.g., power-down of the device due to excessive temperature)

Each system log message identifies the Junos OS process responsible and provides a brief description of the operation or error. For detailed information about specific system log messages, see the System Log Explorer.

To configure the device to log system messages, use the `syslog` statement at the `[edit system]` hierarchy level.

#### Notes
- In Junos OS Release 17.3R1, the `syslog-event` daemon handles `fxp0` in a dedicated management routing instance for IPv4 addressed remote hosts.
- In Junos OS Release 18.1R1, the `syslog-event` daemon supports IPv6-based configuration when connecting to a remote host or an archival site, and `fxp0` is moved to a dedicated management instance.
- In Junos OS Release 18.4R1, the syslog client can send messages through any routing instance defined at appropriate hierarchies. See `routing-instance (Syslog)`.

**Note:** This topic describes system log messages for Junos OS processes and libraries, not the system logging services on a Physical Interface Card (PIC) such as the Adaptive Services PIC.

In Junos OS Evolved, each node has the standard `journalctl` tool, which retrieves and filters the system journal. System log messages are extracted from the system journal. The `relay-eventd` process runs on all nodes and retrieves events (based on the syslog configuration) from the system journal and error messages from different applications, forwarding them to the `master-eventd` process. The `master-eventd` process runs on the primary Routing Engine and writes the log messages and errors to disk.

Use the System Log Explorer application to view or compare system log messages in different releases. In Junos OS Evolved, there is no `messages` file on the backup Routing Engine; all backup Routing Engine logs are in the `messages` file on the primary Routing Engine node.

By default, Junos OS Evolved appends the node name to the hostname in system log messages; Junos OS does not. This action keeps Junos OS Evolved system log messages compliant with RFC5424. However, some monitoring systems may not identify a Junos OS Evolved hostname correctly because the hostname-node name combination does not match any hostnames in the inventory of hostnames.

Starting in Junos OS Evolved Release 20.4R2, to ensure accurate identification of Junos OS Evolved hostnames in your monitoring system, use the `set system syslog alternate-format` configuration mode command. This command changes the format of the Junos OS Evolved system log messages. The node name is prepended to the process name in the message rather than appended to the hostname, allowing the monitoring system to identify the hostname correctly.

For example, Junos OS system log messages do not print the origin process in system log messages coming from an FPC:
```plaintext
user@mxhost> show log messages
Dec 19 13:22:41.959 mxhost chassisd[5290]: CHASSISD_IFDEV_DETACH_FPC: ifdev_detach_fpc(0)
Dec 19 13:23:22.900 mxhost fpc2 Ukern event counter Sock_tx init delayed
```

However, Junos OS Evolved messages append the node name to the hostname and do print the origin process for messages coming from a node, including FPCs:
```plaintext
user@ptxhost-re0> show log messages
May 25 18:41:05.375 ptxhost-re0 mgd[16201]: UI_CHILD_STATUS: Cleanup child '/usr/sbin/dot1xd', PID 21322, status 0
May 25 18:42:34.632 ptxhost-fpc0 evo-cda-bt[14299]: Register bt.igp_misc.debug.hdr_length_cnt not found
May 25 18:42:34.753 ptxhost-fpc1 evo-cda-bt[14427]: HBM: hbm_gf_register_inst
May 25 18:47:14.498 ptxhost-re0 ehmd[5598]: SYSTEM_APP_READY: App is ready re0-ehmd
```

If you have configured the alternate format for Junos OS Evolved system log messages, the same set of system log messages would look like this instead, with the hostname by itself:
```plaintext
user@ptxhost-re0> show log messages
May 25 18:41:05.375 ptxhost re0- mgd[16201]: UI_CHILD_STATUS: Cleanup child '/usr/sbin/dot1xd', PID 21322, status 0
May 25 18:42:34.632 ptxhost fpc0- evo-cda-bt[14299]: Register bt.igp_misc.debug.hdr_length_cnt not found
May 25 18:42:34.753 ptxhost fpc1- evo-cda-bt[14427]: HBM: hbm_gf_register_inst
May 25 18:47:14.498 ptxhost re0- ehmd[5598]: SYSTEM_APP_READY: App is ready re0-ehmd
```

Starting in Junos OS Release 22.1R1 on SRX Series and NFX Series devices and Junos OS Evolved Release 22.2R1 on QFX5130, QFX5200, QFX5220, and QFX5700 devices, multiple events inside the event tag are added using the `UI_LOGIN_EVENT|UI_LOGOUT_EVENT` format, which has an option (`|`) to separate the events and generate system log messages. Earlier to these releases, the event tag used the `UI_LOGIN_EVENT UI_LOGOUT_EVENT` format, and various combinations of RPC filters were not getting logged.

### Platform-Specific Default System Log Messages
The following messages are generated by default on specific routers. To view any of these types of messages, you must configure at least one destination for messages as described in "Junos OS Minimum System Logging Configuration" on page 1269.

- **To log the kernel process message on an M Series, MX Series, or T Series router:**
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  (console | file filename | host destination | user username) {
      kernel info;
  }
  ```

- **On a routing matrix composed of a TX Matrix router and T640 routers:**
  The primary Routing Engine on each T640 router forwards all messages with a severity of `info` and higher to the primary Routing Engine on the TX Matrix router. This is equivalent to the following configuration statement included on the TX Matrix router:
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  host scc-master {
      any info;
  }
  ```

- **Starting in Junos OS Release 15.1X49-D10 and Junos OS Release 17.3R1, likewise on a routing matrix composed of a TX Matrix Plus router with connected T1600 or T4000 routers:**
  The primary Routing Engine on each T1600 or T4000 LCC forwards to the primary Routing Engine on the TX Matrix Plus router all messages with a severity of `info` and higher. This is equivalent to the following configuration statement included on the TX Matrix Plus router:
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  host scc-master {
      any info;
  }
  ```

**Note:** From the perspective of the user interface, the routing matrix appears as a single router. The TX Matrix Plus router controls all the T1600 or T4000 routers connected to it in the routing matrix.
