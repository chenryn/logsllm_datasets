### Direct Communication and Associated Risks

In the described scenario, the two endpoints (i.e., the DPP and the OSP service) communicate directly with each other. This direct communication presents a vulnerability: an attacker could manipulate the values returned to the online shop’s pricing service (OSP). Consequently, the online shop might display incorrect prices to customers, leading to potential financial losses if the manipulated prices are too low, or lost sales if the prices are too high. Similar to RT2, this risk cannot be mitigated or reduced by using end-to-end encryption. DT5 is also unaffected by end-to-end encryption.

### Model Parameters for Occurrence Probabilities and Costs

Tables 4.6 and 4.7 present our model parameters for occurrence probabilities and costs. These estimations are based on recent security papers, reports, and surveys (e.g., Richardson, 2009; Ponemon, 2009; van Kessel, 2009; Patterson, 2002; Campbell et al., 2003; Cavusoglu et al., 2004b). It is important to note that these estimations are for demonstration purposes only. Given the fictional nature of the online shop and the new services, no historical data are available from which to extract these parameters, as was done by Wang et al. (2008, pp. 109–116).

### Assessment of Aggregated Risk

We now present the results of applying our model and algorithms to the described scenario. Figure 4.15 shows the probability density function of the costs and the Values-at-Risk (for α = 0.9) calculated for the two alternative levels of security. Both distributions contain 179 mappings of cost values to their occurrence probabilities, ranging from zero (best case) to 980 (worst case, where all possible risks occur simultaneously). The figure only displays cost values less than 740, as the probability of larger values (up to 980) is 0.001 or smaller.

#### Distribution Analysis

- **Security Level 2 (Solid Red Line):** Shows higher peaks for potential losses below 300.
- **Security Level 1 (Dashed Blue Line):** Exhibits higher peaks for losses above 300, indicating a higher occurrence probability for greater losses under this security level.

For risk-neutral decision makers, the expected value (μ) of the occurring costs is the primary consideration. Security Level 1 has a higher expected value (μ1 ≈ 201.4), while Security Level 2 has a lower expected value (μ2 ≈ 168.0). The standard deviation (σ), a measure of uncertainty, is slightly higher for Security Level 1 (σ1 ≈ 158.2) compared to Security Level 2 (σ2 ≈ 111.0). The Values-at-Risk for a confidence level of 90% are 420 for Security Level 1 and 310 for Security Level 2, meaning that with a 10% probability of error, the arising losses will be equal to or lower than these values.

### Decision Making with Utility Functions

Decision makers with varying risk preferences can use more complex utility functions, such as the μ-σ-rule, which calculates the attractiveness or utility of an alternative based on the mean value and the distribution's standard deviation. The utility function Φ can be adapted to a decision maker's risk preference by varying the parameter λ. For negative values of λ, the decision maker is willing to take risks, while positive values of λ represent risk-averse attitudes. Figure 4.16 shows the utility functions' lines for varying values of λ for both security levels. The lines intersect at λ ≈ −0.71, indicating that decision makers with risk preference parameters below and above −0.71 would rate the two alternatives differently. For λ < −0.71, Security Level 2 is more favorable.

### Implementation Costs Consideration

It is crucial to consider the implementation costs when comparing alternatives, as the difference in expected losses might not justify the higher implementation costs. These costs can be quantified using standard methods for IT project cost estimation (Boehm, 1981). Assuming identical implementation costs and a risk-neutral decision maker, the optimal security level is to use SSL and additional end-to-end encryption (Security Level 2), as it significantly mitigates risks such as profile generation, relay, and eavesdropping of information.

### Identification of Cost Drivers

The proposed model can be used to identify the cost drivers of a given scenario. In this section, we focus on the first level of security in the DPP scenario, where only SSL encryption is used to secure data transfers.

#### Risk Contribution

Table 4.8 shows the risk contribution of individual risks. Only two risks (RS1 and RT1) have more than two cost values, while the other five risks have two cost values: zero if the risk does not occur and the global costs if it does. The sum of all μs (201.4) equals the overall distribution’s expected value, and the sum of all squared σs (25,017.2) equals the square of the overall σ. The Values-at-Risk sum up to 440, confirming that the Value-at-Risk is not additive.

The most serious risk, RS1 (lock-in effects), accounts for 41% of the overall μ and 28% of the overall σ. To mitigate this risk, countermeasures such as alternative providers, fallback solutions, and service level agreements with penalties for downtime, monitored by a trusted third party (Osei-Bryson and Ngwenyama, 2006), can be implemented.

#### Service and Data Transfer Contribution

Table 4.9 shows the risk contribution of each service and data transfer. The central DPP service is the most critical, followed by the CRa service. The DPP service accounts for 65% of the total potential losses and 64% of the variance in the distribution of potential losses. Data transfers 1 and 4, which contain sensitive customer data, contribute significantly to the average losses (μ) and the total uncertainty (σ).

### Decision Support System Prototype

To support the IT risk management process in Cloud Computing scenarios, a decision support system prototype was developed using PHP 5.3. This prototype can be used during the phases of risk quantification and treatment. It performs all calculations described in section 4.1, provides information about the calculations' progress, identifies cost drivers, and visualizes graphs of the calculated aggregated probability density functions of potential losses.

#### Security Measures

Given the confidentiality of the processed information, several security measures were implemented:
- **User Authentication:** Users must authenticate successfully, with unique email validation and password complexity requirements.
- **Password Storage:** Passwords are salted and hashed using eight rounds of the Blowfish algorithm.
- **Data Encryption:** All models and parameters stored on the server’s database are encrypted with AES-256, using a key derived from the user’s password.
- **Input Validation:** User input is validated through a combination of whitelisting and correction on both the client and server sides.
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** A web application framework is used to provide parameterized database access.
- **Secure Connections:** All data transfers require an encrypted connection (HTTPS).
- **CSRF and Replay Attack Prevention:** Nonces (unique, randomly generated keys) are used to prevent Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and replay attacks.
- **Multitenancy Support:** The system supports multiple users with strict separation of user data.

#### User Interface

The user interface is built using HTML5, CSS, JQuery, and jQueryUI. Figures 4.17 to 4.19 show screenshots of the prototype’s user interface, including the parameter entry screen, results visualization, and cost driver details.

#### Summary

The developed decision support system prototype enables decision makers to quickly quantify risks in Cloud Computing scenarios. It efficiently aggregates estimations for individual components into a final, combined distribution of potential losses and helps identify cost drivers in a given scenario.
