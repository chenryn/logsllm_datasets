ends (i. e., the DPP and the OSP service) are directly communicating with each
other. An attacker could return manipulated values to the online shop’s pricing
service (OSP) and thus the online shop would present wrong prices to the cus-
tomer. This could result in losses for the online shop if the manipulated values
are low or in lost sales because of prices which are too high for the customers.
Like RT
2 , this risk cannot be mitigated or reduced by using end-to-end encryp-
tion.
2;DT5 is not inﬂuenced by end-to-end encryption.
In tables 4.6 and 4.7, we present our model parameters for the occurrence prob-
abilities and costs. Our estimations are based on recent security papers, reports
and surveys (e. g., Richardson, 2009; Ponemon, 2009; van Kessel, 2009; Patterson,
2002; Campbell et al., 2003; Cavusoglu et al., 2004b). Note that these estimations
serve for demonstration purposes only. As we deal with a ﬁctional online shop
and new services, no historical data are available from which we could extract the
parameters like, e. g., Wang et al. (2008, pp. 109–116) did.
4.3.1.3 Assessment of Aggregated Risk
In the following, we present the results of applying our model and algorithms on
the described scenario. Figure 4.15 shows the costs’ probability density function
and the Values-at-Risk (for α = 0.9) calculated for the two alternative levels of
security. Both distribution contain 179 mappings of cost values to their occurrence
probabilities, i. e., values on the x-axis of the discrete probability density function,
ranging from zero, in the best case, to 980 in the worst case where all possible risks
occur simultaneously. Figure 4.15 shows only those cost values smaller than 740
as the probability of larger values (up to 980) is 0.001 or smaller.

The distribution for security level 2 (solid red line) shows higher peaks for
potential losses below 300. The ﬁrst level of security’s distribution (dashed blue
line) shows visibly higher peaks for losses above 300, meaning that the occurrence
probability for these greater losses is higher for security level 1. Risk-neutral deci-
sion makers draw their conclusions based on the expected value μi of the occurring
costs and do not take the amount of variation within the costs into account (Gor-
don and Loeb, 2002). The ﬁrst level of security is associated with a higher expected
value of μ1 ≈ 201.4. On average, in the second security level, losses of μ2 ≈ 168.0
arise. The standard deviation, which may serve as a measure of the uncertainty
related to an alternative, is slightly higher (σ1 ≈ 158.2) for security level 1, com-
pared to security level 2 (σ2 ≈ 111.0). The calculated Values-at-Risk for a con-
ﬁdence level of 90% are also shown in ﬁgure 4.15. The second level of security
has a lower Value-at-Risk of 310, while the ﬁrst security level has a Value-at-Risk
of 420. This means that with a probability of error of 10%, the arising losses will
be equal to or lower than 310 or 420.
Decision makers who are willing to take risks or who are risk-averse can use
more complex utility functions like the μ-σ-rule, which calculates the “attractive-
ness” or utility of an alternative based on the mean value and the distribution’s
standard deviation. Using the μ-σ-rule, like −Φ (μi,σi) = −μi − λ · σi, the util-
ity function Φ can be adapted to a decision maker’s risk preference by varying
the parameter λ . For negative values of λ , the decision maker is willing to take
risks, while positive values of λ represent risk-averse attitudes. Figure 4.16 shows
the utility functions’ lines for varying values of the parameter λ for both levels
of security. Both lines intercept at λ ≈ −0.71 and so two decision makers with

risk preference parameters λ below and above −0.71 would rate the two alter-
natives differently. For λ  −0.71, security level 2 is more favorable.
Note that the implementation costs for each of the security levels have to be con-
sidered when comparing alternatives, as the difference in expected losses might not
be worth the higher implementation costs. These costs can, for example, be quan-
tiﬁed using standard methods for cost estimation of IT projects (Boehm, 1981).
Assuming that the decision maker is risk-neutral and the implementation costs for
both alternatives are identical, the optimal security level is to use SSL and addi-
tional end-to-end encryption (i. e., security level 2), as it largely mitigates risks,
such as proﬁle generation, as well as relay and eavesdropping of information.
4.3.1.4 Identiﬁcation of Costs Drivers
As described in section 4.2.1, the proposed model can be used to identify the cost
drivers of a given scenario. Cost drivers are those risks and components, such as
services or data transfers, that contribute a large amount to the aggregated distri-
bution of potential losses.
In this section, the model will be used to ﬁnd the (on average) most expensive
risks and the critical and most risky components for the ﬁrst level of security of
the DPP scenario, presented in section 4.3.1.1. This means, that we only look at

all risks described in section 4.3.1.2, but from the perspective of security level 1,
where only SSL encryption is used in order to secure the data transfers.
1 and RT
Table 4.8 shows that only two risks (RS
1 ) use individual costs ci j, as
there the number of cost values on the x-axis (#c) is greater than two. The other
ﬁve risks have two costs values on their x-axes: zero if the risk does not occur and
the global costs if the risks occurs. Therefore, these ﬁve distributions look similar
to the distributions shown at the left side of ﬁgures 4.2 and 4.9.
The sum of all μs (201.4) equals the overall distribution’s expected value of
the potential losses. Additionally, the sum of all squared σs (25,017.2) equals the
square of the overall σ. The Values-at-Risk sum up to 440, which is more than the
Value-at-Risk of the overall distribution (420) and conﬁrms that the Value-at-Risk
is not additive.
The next serious risks (RS
1, the risk of lock-in effects, accounts for 41% and 28% of the overall μ and σ
RS
and can therefore be considered to be the scenario’s most serious risk. In order
to reduce the effect of this cost driver, countermeasures, such as an alternative
provider as a fallback solution or service level agreements with penalties in case
of downtime, ideally monitored by a trusted third party (Osei-Bryson and Ng-
wenyama, 2006), could be implemented.
1 , and RS
3) could be reduced by additional security
at the application layer (Biskup, 2009). As it was shown during the presentation of
the two alternative levels of security in section 4.3.1.2, SSL only provides security
at the transport layer. Therefore, the protection of sensitive customer data (such as
the name, address, and IP address) can be increased by applying additional end-to-
end security mechanisms. If the OSP service encrypts the data in a way that only
CLo and CRa can read, the potentially malicious DPP service in-between could
not read and learn the data. The central DPP service would only be able to forward
the encrypted data.

Although RT
1 is only responsible for 15% of the average potential losses, this
data transfer alone accounts for 42% of the total variance in possible cost values.
This means that it introduces a great portion of the total uncertainty.
Table 4.9 shows that the central DPP service is most critical, followed by the
CRa service. Especially the DPP service accounts for a very large portion of the
total potential losses, i. e., 65%. Additionally, this central service is responsible
for 64% of the variance in the distribution of potential losses.
Data transfers 1 and 4 have the highest μ and σ characteristics, because they
both contain sensitive customer data. In each case, with 36% and 47%, they con-
tribute a large amount of the average losses (μ) and the total uncertainness (σ).
If we look at single cells’ level, RS
4 are associated with the highest indi-
vidual μ in combination with the central DPP service. The third highest average
individual losses are caused by vendor lock-in (RS
1 and RS
1) in the CRa service.
Tables 4.8 and 4.9 show that the Value-at-Risk of a discrete probability density
function is equal to one of the distribution’s cost values. For distributions with
only two values on the x-axis, this means that the Value-at-Risk equals zero if the
overall probability of the risk not to occur (calculated using 1 - equation (4.2)) is
greater than the conﬁdence level α. In our scenario, RT
3 , OSP, DT1 to DT4,
and DT6 have an occurrence probability for no costs of 0.92 and, thus, a Value-
at-Risk of zero. The Value-at-Risk is therefore a better indicator when it is used in
distributions with more cost values on the x-axis, such as the overall distribution of
potential losses for the whole scenario. As we have shown, the Value-at-Risk has
poor aggregation properties (McNeil et al., 2005, p. 40) and is not as good as μ
and σ for identifying cost drivers because it is not an additive risk measure.

4.3.2 Decision Support System Prototype
123
In order to practically support the IT risk management process related to Cloud
Computing scenarios, a decision support system prototype was developed in
PHP 5.3.
The prototype can be used during the phases of risk quantiﬁcation and treat-
ment. The application performs all calculations described in section 4.1 and pro-
vides information about the calculations’ progress. Furthermore, the application is
capable of identifying the cost drivers of the given scenario (see section 4.2.1) and
it can visualize graphs of the calculated aggregated probability density functions
of the potential losses in order to make investment decisions based on individual
risk metrics.
The application – which can be used to analyze risks in Cloud Computing sce-
narios – is itself a SaaS application that is provided via the Internet and can be
used with all modern browsers.
Due to the conﬁdentiality of the processed information, additional requirements
on security were deduced from general objectives in IT security and the ten most
frequently security risks of web applications (The Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP), 2010). These requirements lead to several security-related
measures: The application can only be used after successful user authentication.
For this, the user’s e-mail address is uniquely validated before the ﬁrst use and the
selected passwords must meet certain complexity requirements. Passwords are not
stored in plain-text, but are salted and hashed using eight rounds of the Blowﬁsh
algorithm. Additionally, all models and parameters of scenarios stored on the
server’s database are encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256
with a key that is derived from the user’s password. Therefore, it is not possible
for the provider to learn about the scenarios stored in the database. All user input
is consistently validated through a combination of whitelisting and correction,
on the client as well as on the server side. A web application framework is
used, which contributes parameterized database access in order to prevent
Structured Query Language (SQL) injections. Furthermore, the developed SaaS
application requires the existence of an encrypted connection (HTTPS) for all
data transfers. Cookies can be transferred via Secure ﬂags only over SSL. Cross
Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks as well as replay attacks are prevented
by applying nonces, i. e., unique, randomly generated keys. Additionally, the
SaaS application supports multitenancy, i. e., different users can be served by
the same system, as within the system, a strict separation of user data is guaranteed.
124
4 Risk Quantiﬁcation Framework
At the client-side, HTML5, in conjunction with CSS, JQuery, and its exten-
sion jQueryUI are used for the visualization of the application’s user interface.
Figures 4.17 to 4.19 show screenshots of the prototype’s actual user interface.
At the beginning of a scenario’s analysis, the parameters are entered (see ﬁg-
ure 4.17). The user enters model parameters such as names, probabilities and costs
of risks, services and data transfers. After completion of the entry, the model is
stored in the database.
The risk-related results of the scenario are calculated and stored in the appli-
cation’s database, as well. Meanwhile, the user is informed on the progress of the
calculation by a progress bar. Following this, the probability density function of
the occurring losses is visualized in the form of a line diagram. Interesting parts of
this view can be enlarged. In addition, the expected value, standard deviation and
Value-at-Risk are determined (see ﬁgure 4.18).
For all individual services, data transfers, and risks, the respective cost drivers of
the scenario are identiﬁed by calculating their individual contribution to the overall
expected value, standard deviation, and Value-at-Risk. These characteristics of the
risk distribution are presented in form of tables, such as shown in ﬁgure 4.19.
Furthermore, the parameters of a scenario and the calculated risk distribution
can be exported. In order to do so, the user chooses one of the two available data
formats: JSON-Format or Microsoft Excel. The scope of the exported ﬁle depends
on whether it contains calculation results. If the distribution of potential losses has
been calculated, it is exported together with the model’s input parameters.
In summary, the developed decision support system prototype enables decision
makers to quickly quantify risks in Cloud Computing scenarios. The SaaS applica-
tion can be used to efﬁciently aggregate the estimations for individual components
to a ﬁnal, combined distribution of potential losses of the whole scenario. Addi-
tionally, it helps identify the cost drivers in a given scenario.
