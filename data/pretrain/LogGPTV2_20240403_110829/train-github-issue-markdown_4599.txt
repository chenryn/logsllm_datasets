Hello,
I try to upgrade my vue app to 1.0 and get the following error over 200 times
for each for loop:  
`[Vue warn]: Duplicate value found in v-for="book in books": "\"". Use track-
by="$index" if you are expecting duplicate values.`
This is my template code with 2 loops:
                    {{book.title}}
                    {{book.title}}
And this is my array with the entries:
    "books": [
        {
          "id": "55",
          "title": "Wir nennen es Politik"
        },
        {
          "id": "1",
          "title": "Die Bienen"
        },
        {
          "id": "2",
          "title": "Finnisches Feuer"
        },
        {
          "id": "3",
          "title": "Träume Digitaler Schläfer"
        }
      ]
Can someone explain me the issue here?
