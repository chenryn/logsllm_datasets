User: I have a python script that does some file processing and need to run as a specific user. Seems on Unix this can be done by using os.setuid. How do I do that in python on windows?
Assistant: check if you are the specific user and if not do not run the python script. It can be done at least in the unix way by checking the uid, in windows you can use wmic useraccount get name,sid to get a users security identifier or in batch use %USERNAME%.
