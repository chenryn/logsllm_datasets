User: How to connect two virtual networks using VNet Peering in Azure?
Assistant: The steps to connect two virtual networks using VNet Peering in Azure are as follows: 1. Create two virtual networks in the Azure portal, namely VNetA and VNetB. 2. Create a virtual network peer in VNetA to peer it with VNetB. 3. Create a virtual network gateway in the Azure portal and connect it to each virtual network peer in VNetA and VNetB. 4. Route traffic to the peered virtual network. 5. Configure network security groups to allow communication across virtual networks. 6. Verify that the Use Remote Gateway option is enabled. 7. Create a test virtual machine in each virtual network and try to communicate using the IP address. 8. Verify that the network connection is successful.
