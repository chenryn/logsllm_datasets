### Analysis of Prefix Advertisement and Traffic

#### Connectivity-Centric Prefix-Level Analysis

For the L-IXP, we observe that out of 408 member ASes, only 24 limit the export of some or all of their prefixes. In contrast, 371 members export their prefixes to more than 90% of the members participating in the Route Server (RS). At M-IXP, the environment is even more peering-friendly, with very few members applying strict export filtering for a small number of prefixes.

#### Traffic Analysis

By matching all destination IP addresses of traffic exchanged on the aggregate of RS prefixes, we find that more than 80% of the overall traffic at L-IXP (and 95% at M-IXP) is sent towards RS prefixes. This indicates that the prefixes advertised at RSes provide significant insight into the spatial aspects of actual traffic components.

In Figure 6(a), we see a bimodal distribution of prefixes based on the number of peers to which they are exported. In Figure 6(b), we plot the sum of the percentage of traffic each prefix is responsible for as a function of the number of RS peers to which the prefix is exported. The openly-advertised prefixes are responsible for the largest traffic share, covering almost 70% of all exchanged traffic in terms of bytes, while the very selectively-advertised prefixes (exported to less than 10% of the member ASes using the RS) cover about 9% of all traffic.

### A Closer Look at RS Usage

To this point, we have focused on the overall traffic at the IXPs and how it relates to the prefixes advertised via the IXP’s RS. We now examine the per-member AS policies that determine which ASes advertise their prefixes to which other ASes and over what kind of IXP peering.

#### Per-Member AS Policies

- **Majority of Members:** Openly advertise their prefixes via the RS, and these prefixes cover a majority of the IXP traffic.
- **Bulk of Traffic:** Traverses bilateral (BL) links.
- **Overlap in Routes:** We investigate if members advertise different prefixes to the IXP’s RS and over their BL peering sessions.

To address this, we use properties of the actual traffic exchanged between members. For each IXP member, we compute the fraction of traffic sent to this member that is covered by the prefixes advertised via the IXP’s RS and the fraction not covered by these prefixes.

#### Figure 7: Traffic to Member ASes

- **X-axis:** Member AS
- **Y-axis:** 
  - Overall traffic to member
  - Traffic on bilateral link

**Figure 7(a): L-IXP**

- **Upper Half:** Traffic covered by RS prefixes
- **Lower Half:** Traffic not covered by RS prefixes

**Figure 7(b): M-IXP**

- **Upper Half:** Traffic covered by RS prefixes
- **Lower Half:** Traffic not covered by RS prefixes

For the majority of members (to the right of x ≈ 120 in Figure 7(a)), all traffic they receive is covered by the prefixes they advertise via the RS. For another set of members (to the left of x ≈ 85), none of the traffic they receive is covered by the RS prefixes. A small group of member ASes in the middle (around x = 100) use both RS-advertised and non-RS-advertised prefixes.

### Summary

- **IXP RSes:** Provide access to a significant portion of the Internet’s routes and networks.
- **Member ASes:** Most provide open access to their RS-prefixes to all IXP RS participants.
- **Routes Advertised:** Via the RS are indeed routes to popular destinations and receive a majority of the traffic at both IXPs.
- **Binary Behavior:** Individual member ASes typically either advertise all routes for which traffic is received via the RS or none at all.
- **Bilateral Sessions:** Many member ASes that openly advertise their prefixes via the RS also establish BL sessions to selected other members ASes without advertising a superset of prefixes on these sessions.

### Table 5: Changes in Peerings and Corresponding Traffic Volumes (L-IXP)

| Period | ML to BL | Δ Trafﬁc (ML to BL) | BL to ML | Δ Trafﬁc (BL to ML) |
|--------|----------|---------------------|----------|---------------------|
| 04-2011 to 12-2011 | 577 | +86% | 172 | +20% |
| 12-2011 to 06-2012 | 440 | +230% | 175 | -77% |
| 06-2012 to 12-2012 | 546 | +82% | 189 | -65% |
| 12-2012 to 06-2013 | 435 | +204% | 242 | -42% |

This table shows the number of peerings changed from multilateral (ML) to bilateral (BL) and vice versa, along with the corresponding changes in traffic volumes carried over these peerings at L-IXP.
