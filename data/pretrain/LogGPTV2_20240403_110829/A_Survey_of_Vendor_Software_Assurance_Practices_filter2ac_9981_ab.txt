the participants than putting their comments in writing.  In 
most  cases,  participants  did  not  have  official  authorization 
to  participate  in  the  study  from  their  employers,  so 
anonymity was critical. 
Finally, when this effort was started, it was intended as 
an  internal  project  to  help  make  the  case  for  greater 
investment  in  software  assurance.    It  wasn’t  until  after 
several  interviews  had  been  completed  and  participants 
expressed interest in knowing the results that we considered 
writing a publishable report. 
III.  STUDY RESULTS 
In this section, we discuss the results from each vendor 
in our sample.   
The terms “small”, “medium”, and “large” in the section 
titles  refer  to  the  approximate  size  of  the  vendor.    For 
purposes  of  this  article,  small  means  under  US$100M  in 
annual software sales, medium means US$100M to US$1B, 
and  large  means  above  US$1B.    Sales  volumes  were 
estimated from [16]. 
Vendors were classified as “security” or “non-security” 
depending  on  the  predominance  of  their  sales.    This 
distinction  was  useful  because  companies  perceived  as 
being  security  vendors  have  a  higher  expectation  from  the 
marketplace – customers assume that security vendors will 
be  less  likely  to  have  security  flaws  than  non-security 
vendors. 
A.  Company M: Small Security Vendor 
As a small security vendor, M has both fewer resources 
to invest in software assurance, and a greater risk.  “Small 
security companies get one chance” is the mantra – a serious 
security  flaw  in  their  product  would  ruin  their  reputation, 
and might well put them out of business.  M does not have a 
dedicated  software  assurance  team  (although  there  is  a 
substantial  QA  team),  nor  is  there  a  single  person  with 
overall responsibility for software assurance other than the 
head of product development. 
M uses several techniques to get software assurance: 
•  They use FIPS 140 validated cryptography (licensed 
from another vendor) in their products to reduce the 
risk of a cryptographic flaw affecting their product. 
•  Because  their  product  is  primarily  shipped  in 
appliance form, they expend considerable energy in 
stripping  down  the  underlying  operating  system  to 
reduce the risks of a flaw in the underlying product 
causing a vulnerability in M’s product. 
•  The  QA  process  places  significant  emphasis  on 
finding security flaws. 
•  When  a  new  employee  is  hired,  he/she  is  paired 
with  a  more  experienced  employee  for  informal 
security  training,  so  that  a  culture  of  awareness  is 
introduced.    However,  there  is  no  formal  training 
provided. 
•  The  primary  focus  for  software  assurance 
is 
penetration  testing,  performed  by  third  parties  that 
M  hires,  and  those  hired  by  M’s  customers  in  the 
commercial and government sectors. 
•  M’s  product  is  written  completely  in  Java,  which 
insulates  them  from  many  of  the  common  security

flaws  found  in  commercial  software  (e.g.,  buffer 
overflows, integer overflows7). 
Several  of  M’s  customers  have  performed  detailed 
penetration  tests,  in  addition  to  the  testing  that  M  does 
themselves.  M does some manual source code reviews, but 
has found this to be expensive and relatively unproductive at 
finding  flaws,  compared  to  other  techniques  they  used.  
There  is  no  formal  threat  modeling;  however  the  design 
review includes approval by product management, the chief 
architect,  and  the  quality  assurance  director.    M  has 
considered using a honeypot to learn whether and how their 
product  is  attacked,  but  have  not  done  so  due  to  resource 
limitations.  M does not use automated scanning or fuzzing 
tools  to  test  its  products,  although  they  have  used  generic 
scanners to look for trivial flaws. 
M  believes  that  penetration  testing  gives  them  the 
greatest  “bang  for  the  buck”  in  reducing  security  flaws, 
followed by their emphasis on QA testing. 
As  noted  above,  M  recognizes  that  bad  publicity 
resulting from a security exploit might lead to their failure 
as  a  company,  and  are  motivated  by  that  more  than 
regulation. 
  While  government  customers  ask  about 
assurance  provided  by  Common  Criteria  [3],  M  says  that 
commercial customers rarely ask about software assurance, 
and  then  generally  only  to  inquire  about  hardening  of  the 
underlying  operating  system.    M  believes  that  customers 
assume  that  as  a  security  vendor,  M  will  ensure  that  the 
product is secure. 
Because M is a security vendor, software assurance has 
always been a concern.  As the company has grown, it has 
been  an 
increasing  focus,  with  more  emphasis  on 
penetration testing. 
B.  Company W: Medium Security Vendor 
As  a  medium  security  vendor,  W  knows  its  customers 
rely on their product to secure their systems.   
There  is  no  single  person  responsible  for  software 
assurance at W; each product team has an informal structure 
responsible  for  their  own  software  assurance  activities.  
Within each team, however, W has processes in place that 
prevent  a  product  release  if  serious  security  vulnerabilities 
are  found,  and  to  promptly  release  fixes  for  any  product 
releases that are in use by customers. 
W  uses  the  following  techniques  to  gain  software 
assurance: 
•  The  QA  team  performs  dynamic  testing,  source 
and 
analysis  using  proprietary 
tools, 
code 
penetration testing. 
•  They perform FIPS 140-2 and Common Criteria [3] 
testing using third-party testing labs.  Unlike many 
vendors, W has found that CC is a useful exercise, 
and  reports  that  security  flaws  have  been  found  in 
the evaluation.  As part of the CC evaluation, a US 
government-approved

source code review, and identified potential issues.

in security vulnerabilities, since the JVM protects against their use to 
access protected memory areas.

•  Newly  hired developers receive approximately two 
weeks  of  training  in  security,  with  much  of  that 
focused on software assurance (the remainder being 
on  the  security  features  of  W’s  products).    In 
addition,  refresher  courses  are  provided  to  update 
developers on new threats. 
While significant emphasis is placed on the QA team, W 
does not have a formal process for threat modeling.  Designs 
are reviewed to ensure that they meet security standards. 
W  finds  that  training  is  the  most  important  factor  in 
ensuring that their product is secure, and they put particular 
emphasis on hiring well-trained employees. 
  Third-party 
W’s  motivations  are  different  from  many  of  the  other 
companies  in  this  study.    As  a  non-US  company,  their 
products  are  treated  with  some  suspicion  by  the  US 
government. 
testing,  especially  Common 
Criteria,  help  allay  those  fears.    W  is  less  concerned  with 
bad  publicity,  and  believes  that  investing  in  software 
assurance is the “right thing” to do for their customers.  W’s 
customers  rarely  ask  about  software  assurance,  probably 
because  the  brand  name  gives  them  confidence  that  W  is 
doing a good job. 
W’s  customers  frequently  perform  their  own  security 
testing, including penetration testing, and can report results 
back to W.  Independent third parties also test W’s products,

C.  Company F: Small Security Vendor 
As a small security vendor that has been in business for 
a  long  time,  F  recognizes  the  risks  of  security  failures.  
While there is not a single person responsible for software 
assurance  (other  than  the  head  of  engineering),  software 
assurance  has  a  significant  influence  at  F,  and  can  stop 
releases if significant security flaws are found. 
F uses the following software assurance techniques: 
•  The  primary  focus  of  software  assurance 
is 
penetration testing during the development process.  
F  has  two  full-time  software  assurance  specialists 
on  staff  (out  of  a  total  R&D  staff  of  about  100).  
Both  have  worked  for  F  for  many  years,  and  are 
familiar with all of the products.  This allows them 
to  rotate  between  penetration  testing  of  existing 
products  and  new  products,  and  to  extend  the 
penetration testing by building custom tools for use 
by QA and developers. 
•  The  software  assurance  specialists  also  perform 
some  manual  source  code  review.    Development 
teams  perform  their  own  design  reviews  because 
they’re  aware  of  the  issues  involved  in  building 
security products. 
•  A  security  review  board  that  includes  the  software 
assurance  specialists  meets  every  two  weeks  to

details is closely controlled.

• 
F  has  an  incident  response  system  that  includes 
informing customers of problems without solutions, 
if the problem is severe.  This allows customers to 
be on alert for attacks, even before a fix is available. 
•  To satisfy government customers, F performs FIPS 
140-2  and  Common  Criteria  evaluations  of  their 
products. 
•  The  software  assurance  specialists  offer  training 
courses  for  developers  and  testers  twice  a  year, 
designed to keep them up to date on threats.  Much 
of  the  material  in  these  courses  comes  from 
conferences  and  workshops 
the  software 
assurance  specialists  attend,  such  as  BlackHat.  
These two-hour courses are videotaped for internal 
use, and F has considered selling the training as an 
offering.  Whenever possible, these training sessions

ask  about  software  assurance  in  RFPs  through  questions 
such as “is your product ethically hacked” or “what is your

is  critical 
Security flaws in embedded third-party and open source 
products  have  been  a  serious  problem  for  F,  as  have  been 
products  that  come  in  via  corporate  acquisitions.    While  F 
does  not  do  source  code  reviews  of  these  products,  they 
perform  a  brief  search  for  malware  before  incorporating 
third-party software, and subject it to penetration testing. 
D.  Company H: Large Security Vendor 
Like many of the companies in the survey, H has grown 
through  numerous  acquisitions.    A  standardized  software 
development  process  has  been  defined  with  security 
elements,  but  is  not  uniformly  applied  or  enforced.    A 
centralized team of security evangelists in the office of the 
CTO  provides  technical  assistance  to  all  of  the  product 
development organizations. 
Software assurance techniques used at H include: 
•  Training 
throughout 
the  company  focused  on 
architectural  reviews,  secure  coding,  and  testing 
processes.    The  training  materials  were  initially 
licensed  from  a  major  university,  and  have  since 
been  customized 
  H  further 
customizes  the  training  for  product  groups,  to 
maximize  relevance  to  the  staff.    While  training  is 
usually a one-time event, organizational turnover is 
high  enough  that  the  training  is  repeated  in  each 
location on a regular basis. 
their  needs. 
to 
• 
In some cases, threat modeling as part of the design 
process. 
•  A  company-wide  license  to  use  a  source  code 
analysis  tool,  along  with  training  by  the  evangelist 
team on how to use the tool effectively. 
•  An in-house penetration testing team, coupled with 
third-party penetration testing when the need arises 
(e.g., because the in-house team is unavailable). 
•  Use  of  a  third-party  team  to  assess  the  security 
status  of  products  being  considered  for  OEM  or 
acquisition,  to  minimize  the  risk  of  acquiring 
security  vulnerabilities  along  with  products.    This 
review  team  currently  operates  after  the  OEM 
arrangement  or  acquisition  has  been  completed.  
The  evangelist  team  believes  it  would  be  more 
effective before the deal is signed, but that change 
has not occurred. 
H  finds  that  training  is  the  most  effective  method  for 
ensuring  software  assurance,  as  it  reduces  the  problems 
before they occur. 
H  has  performed  several  Common  Criteria  evaluations 
of  their  products,  and  has  found  that  the  paperwork-heavy 
process  is  largely  orthogonal  to  their  goals  of  improving 
software assurance. 
A unique problem noted by H is geography.  Like most 
large software vendors, H develops software worldwide, and 
most penetration testing is performed in one of their lower 
cost  locations.    H  considered  and  rejected  locating  their 
penetration  testing  team  in  China  due  to  concerns  by  US 
government  customers  that  a  Chinese  national  might 
discover  a  vulnerability  in  one  of  their  products,  conceal 
that fact and then later try to exploit the vulnerability.  For 
some  products,  H  performs  penetration  testing  in  the  US, 
due to export limitations. 
Several  years  ago  H  was  hit  by  a  string  of  product 
vulnerability disclosures, which resulted in phone calls from 
angry customers to corporate executives, and caused brand 
and image issues.  Until the string of threats to H’s products 
surfaced,  executive  management  at  H  was  not  focused  on 
software assurance.  Thus, H’s motivations are primarily to 
avoid a repetition of the bad publicity.
