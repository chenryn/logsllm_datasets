User: I am trying to install some python packages from the python shell but I get syntaxError. I am using  python 3.4.3 which supposed to come with pip installed and I can see pip3 pip3.4, pip, easy_install, and easy_install-3.4 under scripts but whenever I run the command in the shell I get syntax error. 
Am I not supposed to use the python shell for package installation? I am using windows 8.1 if that would explain something. I tried these commands:
pip install packageName --- got syntaxError with this message:File '' line 1, pip install(with a mark at last l in install). easy_install packageName generated the same error message but with the mark at the last letter in the packagename, i double checked all spellings but I can't seem to see what the problem is.  How can I install packages?
Assistant: Click Windows(button)+R then type cmd. In there type pip -V, what version does it show?
If you get pip 6.1.1 from C:\Python32\lib\site-packages <python 3.4> (depending on your directory) then you're good, simply make your installations from there.
