When using `Deno.listen()` without specifying the `hostname` parameter, it should, by default, listen on both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses. However, I have observed that in the current implementation (Deno 1.21.1), it only listens on IPv4 addresses. 

This discrepancy suggests that the function's behavior does not align with the expected default settings.
