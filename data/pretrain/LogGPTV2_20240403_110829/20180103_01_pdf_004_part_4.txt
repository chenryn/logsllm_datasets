##### 5.4.2 Creating a Basic Grid with Round Numbers
Creating a grid with relatively round numbers is often useful, especially when a subset of points is used for ground-based forest inventories. Coordinates with one or two decimal places are easier to manually enter into a GPS unit compared to coordinates with more digits. (However, various software tools can also transfer spatial data directly to GPS units.) To simplify the coordinates of the grid, the spatial extent values will be rounded to whole numbers and manually entered as the spatial extent of the grid.

1. In the main toolbar, click on **Vector > Research Tools > Regular Points**.
2. Refer to South Africa’s spatial extent, which you pasted in Notepad. Round the X min and Y min values down, and round the X max and Y max values up.
3. Specify the desired grid spacing. For this example, use 0.01 degrees, which will be the distance between points in the grid.
4. Specify the name and location for the new grid, check the box to **Add result to canvas**, and click **OK**.

Initially, the grid may appear as a solid block. Zoom in to view the individual grid points more closely.

To confirm that the operation has been properly completed, measure the distance between the grid points:

1. Click on the dropdown arrow beside the ruler icon and select **Measure Line**.
2. Left-click on a grid point to start the line and right-click on an adjacent point to finish the line.
3. Measure the east-west distance instead of the north-south length. The length of the line will be displayed in the **Measurement window**.

The distance between points should be roughly 1.11 km, which is close to what one might expect 0.01° to equal in South Africa, ranging from 21° to 35° south of the equator.

For more detailed information on decimal degree-to-kilometer estimates, refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees).

In summary, the east-west distance of 1° at the equator is equal to the circumference of the earth (40,075 km) divided by 360 degrees, which is approximately 111.32 km. At other latitudes, the distance will be slightly shorter as the circumference of the earth tapers toward the north and south poles.

##### 5.4.3 Reducing the Grid Layer to Areas of Interest
A fine-scale 0.01° grid is extremely large (with over 2.3 million points) and time-consuming to process. Subsequent processes can be implemented more efficiently if the dataset is reduced to the areas of interest. For example, South Africa will use this fine-scale grid in forest areas, which cover less than 2% of the country’s land area. Very few points in South Africa’s coarse and medium-scale grids fall in forest areas.

1. Load the spatial boundaries of the areas of interest in QGIS. The forest layer appears in blue.
2. Select **Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip**.
3. Use the grid as the input vector layer and the area of interest layer (Forest Patch, in this case) as the clip layer.
4. Add a name and location for the new file, check the box to **Add result to canvas**, and click **OK**.

The resulting file includes the grid points located within forest patches.

##### 5.4.4 Adding Coordinates to the Grid’s Attributes Table
1. Right-click on the grid layer and select **Open Attribute Table**. At this point, the table only contains the point IDs. The total number of points has been reduced from 2,379,999 to 4,605.
2. Under the **Vector** menu, click on **Geometry Tools > Export/Add Geometry Columns**.
3. Select the grid layer with points only in the area of interest as the Input vector layer and click **OK**.
4. Once the process is complete, right-click on the layer and check the data attribute table to confirm that the X (longitude) and Y (latitude) coordinates have been added.

##### 5.4.5 Acquiring SRTM Digital Elevation Data
Visit the CGIAR-CSI (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, Consortium for Spatial Information) website to download 90m resolution digital elevation data. The data, originally from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, is available in GeoTiff and ArcInfo format.

1. The global dataset can be downloaded by region (West, Northeast, and Southeast) by clicking on this [link](http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/) and entering the password listed beside it.
2. To download only the tiles covering the area of interest, click on the **SRTM Data Search and Download** link.

On the SRTM Data Search page:
1. Select CGIAR-CSI as the server.
2. Enable mouse drag as the data selection method.
3. Choose GeoTiff as the file format.
4. Click and drag the mouse over the relevant tiles and download your selection.

Once the download is complete, load the geotiff in QGIS. Right-click on the layer and review the metadata to confirm that it is in the same projection as the other spatial data you are using.

##### 5.4.6 Deriving Slope and Aspect Data from Digital Elevation Data
1. Under the **Raster** menu, click on **Analysis > DEM (Terrain models)**.
2. Input the SRTM digital elevation data.
3. Specify the output location and file name.
4. Check the box for band and select 1 (there is only one band in the SRTM data).
5. Click on the dropdown arrow beside mode and select **Slope**.
6. Type in 111120 as the scale for converting meters to decimal degrees. (For more information on this conversion, visit the GDAL website: [GDAL DEM](http://gdal.org/gdaldem.html)).
7. Check the box to load the resulting layer once the process is complete, then click **OK**.

Use the same tool to derive aspect data:
1. Input the SRTM digital elevation model data.
2. Specify the output location and file name.
3. Check the box for band and select 1.
4. Click on the dropdown arrow beside mode and select **Aspect**.
5. Check the box to return 0 for flat instead of -9999.
6. Check the box to load the resulting layer once the process is complete, then click **OK**.

The resulting slope and aspect layers are raster files separate from the original SRTM elevation raster.

##### 5.4.7 Adding Elevation, Slope, and Aspect Data to the Grid
This step involves two parts. First, extract elevation, slope, and aspect data from the rasters and associate them with each point in the forest grid. This results in three separate point files. Second, consolidate the elevation, slope, and aspect data into the main forest grid file, which already contains the point coordinates.

1. In QGIS, click on **Manage and Install Plugins**. Search for and install the **Point Sampling Tool** plugin.
2. In the QGIS table of contents, check the boxes for the relevant layers only. Start with the SRTM elevation layer and the fine 0.01-degree grid over forest areas.
3. Under the **Plugins** menu, click on **Analyses > Point Sampling Tool**.
4. Use the point sampling tool to add elevation to the grid file:
   - Select the fine forest grid as the layer containing sampling points.
   - Select the SRTM elevation data, band 1 raster.
   - Specify the output location and file name.
   - Check the box to load the resulting layer once the process is complete, then click **OK**.

The resulting shapefile contains the elevation at each point. Repeat the process for slope and aspect, creating separate shapefiles for each.

To consolidate the elevation, slope, and aspect data with the main forest grid:
1. Click on the **Vector** menu and select **Data Management Tools > Join attributes by location**.
2. Start by adding elevation data:
   - Select the forest grid (with coordinates) for the target vector layer.
   - Select the elevation points as the vector layer to join.
   - Take attributes of the first located feature.
   - Specify the output location and file name.
   - Keep only matching records, then click **OK**.

Repeat the process for slope and aspect data, changing the target vector file to the most recent join.

The intermediary elevation, slope, and aspect point files and the first two spatial joins are temporary files that can be deleted once the final shapefile is produced. The final join should have a clear file name consistent with the other Collect Earth survey files (no spaces, alpha-numeric characters only).

After consolidating elevation, slope, and aspect data with the main forest grid, right-click on the layer and review the data attributes table to confirm that the process has been completed properly.

##### 5.4.8 Formatting the Grid as a CSV Compatible with Collect Earth
Collect Earth uses grids in CSV format with six basic attributes in a particular order:
1. Plot ID number
2. Latitude (y coordinate)
3. Longitude (x coordinate)
4. Elevation
5. Slope
6. Aspect

Collect Earth South Africa draws upon several additional attributes. The order of the columns is important for compatibility, but the columns can be empty if such data is not available or up-to-date:
1. ADM1_NAME (province name)
2. BIOMECODE
3. Type
4. Forest Type
5. Forest Group
6. Bio Region

The final shapefile produced is comprised of six separate files. Open the DBF file in Libre Office or Microsoft Excel.

1. Remove all &, ‘, “, and other symbols that are not alphanumeric characters from the headers and all rows in the spreadsheet.
2. Adjust the order and names of columns. Note that the order of the coordinates must be reversed so that the y coordinate (latitude) precedes the x coordinate (longitude).
3. Save the file as a CSV.

For Collect Earth South Africa, add a column for province name, biome code, biome type, forest type, forest group, and bioregion. If spatial data for these attributes is available, use the **Join attributes by location** tool in QGIS (see 5.2.7 above) to populate these columns. If supplementary data is not available, the column headers still must be added, but the rows beneath the header can remain blank.

Move the CSV to the survey files folder within the Collect Earth folder. Open the CSV in Collect Earth and confirm that the points mostly fall within forest areas. Zoom in and measure the distance between points to ensure consistency. In Google Earth, you can also measure distance in decimal degrees.

### Synergies Between Collect Earth Sampling and Wall-to-Wall Mapping
#### 6.1 Preparing Vector Data in Google Fusion Tables
#### 6.1.1 Importing Collect Earth Data into Google Fusion Tables
Google Fusion Tables is a web-based service provided by Google for data management. Collect Earth data can be exported as a CSV that is compatible with Google Fusion Tables. Regardless of which CED file is visible in Collect Earth, the Fusion Table option exports the entire country’s dataset.

1. Log into Google Drive: [drive.google.com](http://drive.google.com) or go directly to the [Google Fusion Table website](https://www.google.com/fusiontables). You will need a Google account to proceed.
2. Within Google Drive, click **Create** in the upper-left corner. If you have never used Google’s Fusion Tables App, click on **Connect More Apps** at the bottom of the list.
3. Type **Fusion Tables** in the search field, click **+Connect** to add the app to your Google Drive.
4. Select **Fusion Table** in your updated Google Drive Create menu.
5. Browse for the Fusion Table file exported from Collect Earth, click **Next**.
6. Preview the table, then click **Finish**.

Fusion Tables can be viewed in a tabular format, as a series of cards, in charts, or in a map. The map view is useful for quickly reviewing spatial data that will be used in Earth Engine. If Google Fusion Tables has difficulty geocoding the data, Earth Engine may not be able to display it. Collect Earth facilitates data compatibility by concatenating the coordinates of each point into a single column, identified as the location column.

If the data does not properly geocode, the data may be poorly positioned or a message may appear regarding the lack of a location column. To indicate which column contains the location data:
1. Return to the **Rows** tab.
2. Click on the header or the column that contains location data and select **Change**.
3. Click on the dropdown arrow under **Type** and select **Location**. Save changes.

You can filter the data and use a subset as training data for a supervised classification. For a supervised classification, it is advisable to use at least 10 points for each band of imagery and land use class. When using all 13 bands of Landsat 8 imagery to classify an area into the six IPCC recommended land use categories, it is recommended to use a minimum of 780 training points (10x13x6).

Countries that use Collect Earth as a primary means of classifying land use will have tens of thousands of points that could be used as training data for a wall-to-wall classification. For example, Papua New Guinea and Mongolia have conducted land use assessments using a systematic grid comprised of 25,000-30,000 points. However, using the entire dataset in a classification will not necessarily improve the results. It is best to use a subset of the data that surpasses the minimum amount recommended and (ideally) includes the portion that has been quality-controlled.

The data can be filtered by:
- Land use category to filter out points that are not assigned to one of the six land use categories.
- Land use category accuracy to filter out points with low accuracy.
