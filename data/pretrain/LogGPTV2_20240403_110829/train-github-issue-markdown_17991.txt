 **Symfony version(s) affected** : 4.1.0
**Description**
Symfony does not throw an exception `Circular reference detected for service
"%s", path: "%s".` whenever I am using `!tagged` syntax.
**How to reproduce**
  1. Create the following class:
    services = $services;
        }
    }
  2. Create the following configuration:
        App\Services\MyService:
            arguments: ['@App\Services\MyService']
Now we will get `Circular reference detected for service
"App\Services\MyService", path: "App\Services\MyService ->
App\Services\MyService".`, it is fine.
  3. Replace the configuration by the following code:
        App\Services\MyService:
            arguments:
              - !tagged my-service
            tags:
                - {name: 'my-service'}
Symfony does not warn by exception about circular dependency. My real example
was much more complex and actually it was my bug, but anyway would be nice to
be informed about bug by semantic exception.
**Possible Solution**
Throw
`Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Exception\ServiceCircularReferenceException`
in such cases, or add simple console commend to check if we have circular
dependency.
