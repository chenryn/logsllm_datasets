I have an issue with validator component. I have a base class and a child.
Base class defines a property and a set of constaints. Child must redefine one
of the constraints - it must modify its options.I am using StaticMethodLoader
for both classes because I am in control and I can work with constraints. The
problem is that I get two violations instead of one when validating child
object. Constraint is validated twice - with child options first and then with
base class options. I tried to investigate why but I still don't know why its
happening. And I am a bit lost in all the loaders and caching.
However, the result is quite unexpected for me. I thought that validator
honors inheritance.
Thanks for any help.
