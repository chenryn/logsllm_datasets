User: So I'm debugging my python program and have encountered a bug that makes the program hang, as if in an infinite loop. Now, I had a problem with an infinite loop before, but when it hung up I could kill the program and python spat out a helpful exception that told me where the program terminated when I sent it the kill command. Now, however, when the program hangs up and I ctrl-c it, it does not abort but continues running. Is there any tool I can use to locate the hang up? I'm new to profiling but from what I know a profiler can only provide you with information about a program that has successfully completed. Or can you use a profiler to debug such hang ups?
Assistant: Wow! 5 answers already and nobody has suggested the most obvious and simple:

Try to find a reproducible test case that causes the hanging behavior.
Add logging to your code.  This can be as basic as print "**010", print "**020", etc. peppered through major areas.
Run code.  See where it hangs.  Can't understand why?  Add more logging.  (I.e. if between **020 and **030, go and add **023, **025, **027, etc.)
Goto 3.
