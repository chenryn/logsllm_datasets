### Title: Grand Theft Drone: Reaching a Breaking Point in Drone Proprietary RF Link Security

The drone industry is undergoing significant transformation, with remote control technology for drones seeing substantial improvements. However, many remote control vendors still lack robust security features and rely on proprietary protocols instead of standardized ones. This reliance on proprietary protocols, which often lack adequate security, violates the "Principle of Open Design." Manufacturers often hide hopping patterns and RF signal specifications to protect their products' communication mechanisms, relying on "security through obscurity" to extend their product lifespans.

To combat counterfeiting, eavesdropping, and skyjacking by hackers, vendors have transitioned from designs that connect separate CPU and RF chips via a serial interface to custom-made SoCs (System on Chip). These integrated circuits are tailored to specific purposes as per the vendor's requirements. The firmware is typically encrypted, and datasheets and other relevant information are kept private and not publicly available. Despite these efforts, one of the most popular vendors continues to exhibit significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in terms of RF reverse engineering.

In this study, we present an SDR-based live packet sniffer and cloning transmitter for the proprietary drone protocol, FrSky's next-generation "ACCESS," which the vendor claims offers enhanced security. Our findings reveal that the newest protocol does not adequately protect critical information transmitted over the air. Additionally, there are security issues with the frequency hopping table and sequence generation, making it relatively easy for malicious attackers to take over the drones.

We will demonstrate a skyjacking attack, where we gain full control of the drone. We will also explore feasible and effective mitigation strategies to address RF reverse-engineering attacks.
