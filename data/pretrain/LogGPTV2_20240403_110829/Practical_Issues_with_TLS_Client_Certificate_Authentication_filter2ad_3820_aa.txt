## Abstract
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, the most widely used secure Internet communication standard, includes an optional client certificate authentication feature. This feature theoretically offers significant security advantages over traditional HTML form-based password authentication. In this paper, we discuss practical security and usability issues related to TLS client certificate authentication, focusing on server-side and browser implementations. Specifically, we analyze Apache’s mod_ssl implementation on the server side and the most popular browsers—Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Internet Explorer—on the client side. We complement our analysis with a measurement study conducted in Estonia, where TLS client certificate authentication is widely used. Our recommendations aim to improve the security and usability of TLS client certificate authentication.

## 1. Introduction
The TLS protocol is the standard method for securing Internet connections between a client's browser and HTTP web servers. It is primarily used to authenticate the server, ensuring that the client communicates with a legitimate party and that the data exchanged remains confidential and unaltered. Typically, the client authenticates itself by submitting identification data (e.g., a username) and a shared secret (e.g., a password) over an already established, server-authenticated secure channel. However, this process can be vulnerable to various attacks, such as phishing, credential reuse, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, leading to unauthorized access to the client's account and private information.

TLS client certificate authentication (CCA) can mitigate these risks by providing a more robust authentication mechanism. Despite its potential, CCA faces several practical issues in deployment. This paper aims to address these issues and provide solutions to enhance the security and usability of TLS CCA.

### Contributions
- **Systematic Analysis:** We provide a comprehensive analysis of known and less-known issues related to deploying TLS CCA.
- **Measurement Study:** We present a detailed report on a measurement study of 87 Estonian service providers who use TLS CCA.
- **Recommendations:** We offer a list of recommendations to address the identified problems and improve the use of TLS CCA.

## 2. TLS Overview
### 2.1 Server-Authenticated TLS Handshake
The TLS protocol, including its predecessor SSL, has several versions. In this paper, we focus on TLS version 1.0, which is the most widely supported. The handshake process involves the exchange of cryptographic keys and certificates to establish a secure connection. The key steps include:

- **ClientHello:** The client initiates the connection by sending a list of supported cipher suites and a random value.
- **ServerHello:** The server responds with its own random value and selects a cipher suite from the client's list.
- **Certificate Exchange:** The server sends its X.509 certificate, and the client verifies it using the public key infrastructure (PKI).
- **Key Exchange:** The client generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it to the server.
- **ChangeCipherSpec and Finished:** Both parties confirm the successful setup of the secure connection by exchanging encrypted messages.

### 2.2 Client-Authenticated TLS Handshake
In a client-authenticated TLS handshake, the server additionally requests the client's certificate. The key steps include:

- **CertificateRequest:** The server sends a list of trusted CAs and requests the client's certificate.
- **Client Certificate:** The client sends its certificate, which the server verifies.
- **CertificateVerify:** The client signs a hash of the handshake messages with its private key to prove possession of the corresponding private key.

### 2.3 Renegotiation and Session Resumption
- **Renegotiation:** The server or client can request a new TLS handshake at any time, often to negotiate stronger cipher suites or perform CCA.
- **Session Resumption:** To save time, a previously negotiated session can be resumed, avoiding the need for a full handshake. This is particularly useful when the client's private key is stored in a smart card.

## 3. Practical Issues
### 3.1 Server-Side Configuration: Apache mod_ssl
Most service providers use Apache HTTP server with the mod_ssl module for TLS CCA. Key configuration directives include:

- **SSLVerifyClient:** Controls whether CCA is required, optional, or not used.
- **SSLCACertificateFile:** Specifies the location of trusted root CA and intermediate CA certificates.
- **SSLVerifyDepth:** Sets the maximum length of the certificate chain.
- **SSLCADNRequestFile:** Specifies the DNs of trusted CAs for the CertificateRequest message.

### 3.2 Certificate Verification
OpenSSL performs certificate verification, but the configuration options provided by mod_ssl may not be sufficient for secure CCA in advanced PKI settings. For example, if the trust store contains multiple intermediate CAs, a client certificate issued by any of these CAs will be accepted, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

### 3.3 Measurement Study
We conducted a measurement study of 87 Estonian service providers to evaluate their TLS CCA deployments. The results highlight common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, such as accepting client certificates from untrusted CAs and failing to enforce strict certificate validation.

## 4. Recommendations
To improve the security and usability of TLS CCA, we recommend:

- **Enhanced Configuration:** Ensure that the SSLCACertificateFile and SSLCADNRequestFile are correctly configured to only accept certificates from trusted CAs.
- **Strict Validation:** Implement additional application-level checks to validate the client certificate against the expected CA.
- **User Education:** Educate users on the importance of secure practices, such as not reusing passwords and verifying the authenticity of the server.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

## 6. Conclusion
TLS client certificate authentication offers significant security benefits over traditional password-based authentication. However, practical issues in deployment, such as misconfigurations and weak certificate validation, can undermine its effectiveness. By addressing these issues and following our recommendations, service providers can enhance the security and usability of TLS CCA, making it a more viable and widely adopted authentication method.
