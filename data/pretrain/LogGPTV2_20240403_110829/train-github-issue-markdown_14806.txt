### Your question
As we can see in the documentation  
`https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-elementhandle#element-handle-wait-for-
element-state`  
We have WaitForSelector() has  
1.'attached'  
2.'detached'  
3.'visible'  
4.'hidden'  
But while writing the script I can only view Visible and attached options
only.
    protected async invisiblity(ele) {
        const element = await this.page.$(ele);
        await element.waitForSelector(ele,{state:" "})
      }
is there any way we can use detached of a selector.  
Thank u .
