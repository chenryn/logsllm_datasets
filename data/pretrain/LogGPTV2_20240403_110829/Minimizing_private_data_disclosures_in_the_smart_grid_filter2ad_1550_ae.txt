rithm in this binary model. Rajagopalan et al. [37] also use the
mutual information between the external load and the demand load
in measuring privacy. No BLH algorithm was proposed in [37].
Acs et al. [3] add Laplace and truncated geometric noise to the ex-
ternal load through battery discharging in order to gain differential
privacy guarantees, but do not consider the case where the battery
must be recharged. Backes et al. [5] extends this scheme to include
battery recharging, and shows that the power consumption of a tele-
vision can be made differentially private with very large batteries.
A different approach to obtaining privacy guarantees for load
proﬁles is to trust the utility to implement privacy protections in
the meter. One of the ﬁrst approaches suggested is to use a zero
knowledge protocol between a third party and the utility to report
load aggregates from the meter [32, 38, 19]. This allows for time of
day billing to be done without releasing ﬁne-grained load proﬁles.
Differential privacy has also been proposed for load proﬁles [2] by
adding Laplacian noise. However, this work does not apply to time-
varying billing rates. In [41] Shi et al. use homomorphic encryption
to make guarantees about sums taken at an aggregation point. Our
paper is orthogonal to this line of research. For these cryptographic
mechanisms to be effective, they need to be adopted by smart meter
vendors and the utilities, and the smart meters and vendors must be
trusted. As smart meters are already being deployed, it appears that
the likely scenario is that the majority of deployed smart meters
will not support these protocols. Our approach can be deployed
with existing smart meters.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have identiﬁed new vulnerabilities in two existing BLH al-
gorithms that allow for the recovery of substantial appliance us-
age information. We have also introduced a novel stepping-based
framework for BLH algorithms, which by design are secure against
precise load change recovery attacks. We also propose mutual-
information based measurements to evaluate the privacy of differ-
ent algorithms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effec-
tiveness of our approach, and in particular the LS2 stepping algo-
rithm signiﬁcantly and consistently outperforms other algorithms.

Mutual Information Under the Markov Assumption. While the
independence assumption makes the computation very efﬁcient, it
ignores correlations embedded in samples of e′(t) (and of d′(t))—
as time series, these samples are naturally correlated (e.g., e′(t)
may depend on e′(t − 1)). To address this issue, we model samples
in f (t), e′(t) and d′(t) by stationary ﬁrst-order Markov chains. As
a result, we have
p(e′(t) = a) = PT
p(e′(t) = a|e′(t − 1) = c) = PT

APPENDIX
A. MUTUAL INFORMATION MEASURES
Mutual information between e′ and d′ allows us to quantitatively
measure how much common information embedded in e′ and d′,
regardless what algorithms—linear or nonlinear, deterministic or
stochastic—have been used to generate e′ given d′.
Mutual Information Under the Independence Assumption. Us-
ing the independence assumption, we can easily compute the mu-
tual information I as follows. We ﬁrst discretize e′(t) (and d′(t))
into K discrete values (in our experiments, we set K = 500).
We then estimate the joint distribution p(f (t)), where f (t) =
(e′(t), d′(t) at each time by simply counting the number of the
joint appearance of (a, b) and normalizing it:
p(e′(t) = a, d′(t) = b) = PT
T
i=1 δ(e′(i) = a ∧ e′(i) = b)
where δ(·) is 1 if the statement inside is true. Given the joint dis-
tribution, we can easily obtain the marginal distributions of e′(t)
and d′(t): where p(e′(t)) = Pd′(t) p(e′(t), d′(t)) and p(d′(t)) =
Pe′(t) p(e′(t), d′(t)).
Given the joint and marginal distributions, we calculate the mu-
tual information as follows:
I(e′(i)||d′(i))
I(e′||d′) = Xi=1,...,T
= Xi Xe′(i) Xd′(i)
p(e′(i), d′(i)) log
p(e′(i), d′(i))
