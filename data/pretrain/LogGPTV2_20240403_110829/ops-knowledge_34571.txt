User: I have this program that at one point accesses os.getcwd(), but some times, depending on where the program has gone before getting to that line, it crashes with the message "OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory". 
I cannot figure out what i can do wrong then calling os.getcwd(). There's no arguments, and there should always be a current working directory, right?
Assistant: You might get that error if the current working directory has been deleted. Programs that are working in a particular directory don't automatically notice if the directory gets deleted; as far as the program is concerned, the CWD is just a string, at least until you do something like os.getcwd() that actually accesses that path on the filesystem. So it's possible to have a current directory that doesn't exist.
Without knowing more about your program and its execution environment, I couldn't tell you if that is what's actually happening, though.
