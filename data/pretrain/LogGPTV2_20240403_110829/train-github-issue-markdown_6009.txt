 **Description**  
Currently when a service is inlined in anoter service you get a log message
like
> Inlined service "abc" to "xyz".
And at the same time you also get a log message that the service got removed
> Removed service "abc"; reason: unused.
IMO when it a service is inlined, it should not also log that it got removed.  
This way you can actually find services that are unused. Currently you get
alot of duplicate messages for inlined services. And the reason "unused" is
even more irritating as it is not really unused, it was just inlined because
it's only used once.
Another improvement can be made for the autowire pass. When an object argument
has a default value that cannot be wired, it does not error but logs a message
like
> Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Compiler\AutowirePass  
>  Cannot autowire service "Ekino\NewRelicBundle\Listener\ResponseListener":
> argument "$newRelicTwigExtension" of method "__construct()" references class
> "Ekino\NewRelicBundle\Twig\NewRelicExtension" but no such service exists.
This is good. But for consistency and debugging purposes, it would be good if
a scalar argument that has a default value that wasn't wired explicitly, also
triggers a log. You might have just forgotten to wire it with a parameter for
example and that is hard to spot.
