User: When I deploy an application using the Google App Engine Launcher (version 1.6.2) on Windows, the following command options show in the output window:

Running command: "[u'C:\Python27\pythonw.exe',
  '-u', u'C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\google_appengine\appcfg.py',
  '--no_cookies', u'--email=xxxx.xxxx@xxxx.xxx', '--passin', 'update',
  u'C:\path\to\project']"

I want the launcher to store my application-specific password, and I know that it needs to use a cookie to do that, but for some reason the launcher is defaulting to send the "no_cookies" option.
Is there a way to turn this option off?
Assistant: The launcher will always prompt you for credentials, it uses the no_cookies flag to make sure the given credentials are passed and not the one stored in the system.
What you can do is create a batch file that will deploy the application, you can provide credentials using the --email and --passin flags.
