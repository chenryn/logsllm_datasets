I am new to Python and am currently working on implementing the `ls` command in Python. I am specifically having trouble with the `-a` option, which, according to the man page, includes directory entries whose names begin with a dot (`.`).

I am aware of the `os.listdir()` function, but it does not list the special entries `.` and `..`.

From the documentation for `os.listdir(path)`:
> Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path. The list is in arbitrary order and does not include the special entries `.` and `..`, even if they are present in the directory.

Could someone please help me figure out how to include these special entries in the output? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your patience.

**Solution:**
You can manually add the special entries `.` and `..` to the result of `os.listdir()`. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
import os

def list_directory_with_special_entries(path):
    # Get the list of directory entries
    entries = os.listdir(path)
    
    # Add the special entries '.' and '..'
    entries_with_special = [os.curdir, os.pardir] + entries
    
    return entries_with_special

# Example usage
path = '/path/to/directory'
result = list_directory_with_special_entries(path)
print(result)
```

Most modern file systems no longer create actual hard links for `.` and `..`, but the APIs typically include them explicitly. This approach should give you the desired output similar to `ls -a`.
