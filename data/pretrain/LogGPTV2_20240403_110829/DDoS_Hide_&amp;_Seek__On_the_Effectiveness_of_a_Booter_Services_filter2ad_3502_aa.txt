### Abstract
Booter services continue to provide popular DDoS-as-a-service platforms, enabling individuals, regardless of their technical expertise, to launch devastating DDoS attacks. These services pose a significant threat to Internet operations, causing substantial financial and reputational damage. Consequently, they attract the attention of law enforcement agencies and related countermeasures. In this paper, we investigate booter-based DDoS attacks in the wild and the impact of an FBI takedown targeting 15 booter websites in December 2018, from the perspective of a major IXP and two ISPs. We analyze and compare the attack properties of multiple booter services by launching Gbps-level attacks against our own infrastructure. To understand the spatial and temporal trends of DDoS traffic originating from booters, we examine five months of inter-domain traffic. Our findings indicate that the takedown only led to a temporary reduction in attack traffic. Additionally, one booter quickly resumed operations using a new domain.

### 1. Introduction
#### The DDoS Threat
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have been a significant security threat to the continuous operation of the Internet for at least two decades. These attacks aim to disrupt services by overwhelming critical resources such as computing power or network bandwidth. Beyond web services, modern DDoS attacks can also overwhelm cloud services or congest backbone peering links. Motivations for launching DDoS attacks range from financial gain, political motives, cyber warfare, serving as a smokescreen for other types of attacks, and even teenagers attacking their schools. To scale, DDoS amplification attacks exploit protocol design flaws, such as NTP, DNS, SNMP, and Memcached, where a small request can trigger a significantly larger response. Spoofed source IP addresses allow traffic to be reflected to the target, leading to attacks increasing in size and sophistication. A few years ago, the largest reported attacks peaked just below 300 Gbps, whereas recent DDoS attacks have reached the Tbps level.

#### Booters as DDoS Tools
DDoS-as-a-service providers, commonly known as booters or stressers, offer a simple web interface that enables anyone to launch attacks at a low cost, often ranging from $0 to $5. At the higher end, some booters claim to offer large-scale attacks for hundreds of USD.

#### Booter-Related Research
Extensive research on booters covers various aspects, including:
1. Analysis of leaked booter databases.
2. Studies of booter attacks.
3. Examination of booter victims.
4. Use of honeypots for booter attacks.
5. Attribution of attacks using honeypots.
6. TLS certificates used by booters.
7. Booter blacklists and their origins.
8. Market analysis using blacklists.
9. Ethical and legal aspects of booters.
10. Impact of law enforcement operations on booters.

#### Our Contribution
In this study, we provide the first empirical analysis of an FBI-led operation targeting 15 booter domains in December 2018. Instead of focusing on financial interventions, we examine the impact of this event on DDoS attack traffic observed through the lens of three major networks: a tier-1 ISP, a tier-2 ISP, and a major IXP. Our study begins with self-attacks using four popular booters to understand current booter capabilities, including premium (VIP) services. We then investigate spatial and temporal trends in DDoS traffic, providing an overview of the current DDoS threat landscape. Finally, we focus on network traffic during the FBI takedown, applying the characteristics learned from our self-attack approach. Our key contributions are:
- **Anatomy of Booter Attacks:** We launch attacks against our infrastructure, observing high attack traffic volumes of up to 20 Gbps.
- **Current Threat Landscape:** We present an overview of the DDoS threat landscape through the lens of three major networks, observing constant DDoS attacks with thousands of victims and traffic rates up to 600 Gbps.
- **Effectiveness of FBI Takedown:** We study the effectiveness of the FBI takedown, finding that it temporarily reduced DDoS amplification traffic but had no significant effect on DDoS traffic hitting victims or the number of observed attacks.

### 2. Vantage Points
Our study is based on three vantage points: a major IXP, a tier-1 ISP, and a tier-2 ISP, providing a unique perspective on DDoS attack traffic in the wild. None of the datasets contain any payload data. Additionally, we perform active measurements of large sets of domains within an observatory to identify booter websites.

- **Major IXP:** Anonymized and sampled IPFIX traces captured at a major IXP between October 27, 2018, and January 31, 2019, containing 834 billion flows.
- **Tier-1 ISP:** Netflow traces from all border routers (ingress only) of a tier-1 ISP, anonymized and filtered by protocol and port, resulting in 6.6 billion flow records for the period from December 12 to December 30, 2018. The trace includes traffic to fixed-line end-users, cellular customers, and transit traffic, but not end-user and customer traffic.
- **Tier-2 ISP:** The second ISP dataset, anonymized and filtered similarly to the tier-1 ISP, but including both ingress and egress traffic. This results in 470 million flow records from September 27, 2018, to February 2, 2019.
- **IXP Observatory:** We set up and operate an IXP-based DDoS observatory, comprising a measurement AS connected to an IXP via a 10GE link. Data collection is performed directly at the IXP platform (sampled) and at the measurement AS itself (unsampled).
- **DNS and HTTPS Observatory:** To study the rise and fall of booter websites, we use weekly crawls of approximately 140 million .com/.net/.org domains, performing DNS resolutions and HTTPS website snapshots from January 2018 to May 2019.

### 3. Booter: Victimâ€™s Perspective
We begin by taking the victim's perspective to study the potential damage that booter-based DDoS attacks can cause. We do this by purchasing services from popular booters to attack our dedicated measurement infrastructure at an IXP between April and September 2018. This provides a unique insight into current booter service capabilities, including the generation of powerful Tbps-level attacks. Our study is the first to evaluate the reliability of these services, such as premium membership benefits, promised attack protocols, and duration. Using our measurement infrastructure, we can draw conclusions about the DDoS traffic landscape and utilize the self-attack to identify attack characteristics for later discovery of DDoS attack traffic at our vantage points.

#### 3.1 Self-Attack Approach
- **Selected Booter Services:** We selected four popular booters (anonymized) from the booter blacklist based on their Alexa website rank. Two of the selected booters were later seized by the FBI-led takedown, while three remain operational (one seized booter resumed using a new website). We purchased paid services from all booters, including cheaper (non-VIP) and more expensive premium packages (VIP).
