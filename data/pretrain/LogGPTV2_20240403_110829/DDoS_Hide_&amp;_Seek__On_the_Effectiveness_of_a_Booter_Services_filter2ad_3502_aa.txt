ABSTRACT
Booter services continue to provide popular DDoS-as-a-service
platforms and enable anyone irrespective of their technical ability,
to execute DDoS attacks with devastating impact. Since booters
are a serious threat to Internet operations and can cause significant
financial and reputational damage, they also draw the attention
of law enforcement agencies and related counter activities. In this
paper, we investigate booter-based DDoS attacks in the wild and
the impact of an FBI takedown targeting 15 booter websites in De-
cember 2018 from the perspective of a major IXP and two ISPs. We
study and compare attack properties of multiple booter services
by launching Gbps-level attacks against our own infrastructure. To
understand spatial and temporal trends of the DDoS traffic origi-
nating from booters we scrutinize 5 months, worth of inter-domain
traffic. We observe that the takedown only leads to a temporary
reduction in attack traffic. Additionally, one booter was found to
quickly continue operation by using a new domain for its website.
1 INTRODUCTION
The DDoS threat. Known for at least two decades [15], Distributed
Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have become a major security
threat to the continuous operation of the Internet [20, 51, 58]. Their
goal is to disrupt services by consuming more critical resources than
available, e.g., computing power or network bandwidth. Beyond
the web, modern DDoS attacks can overwhelm cloud services [50]
or congest backbone peering links [49]. The motivation for launch-
ing attacks ranges from financial [9, 53], to political [4, 35], cyber
warfare [19, 54], smoke screen for other attack types [33], and even
teenagers attacking their schools [47]. To scale, DDoS amplifica-
tion attacks [42, 43] abuse protocol design (flaws)—e.g., NTP, DNS,
SNMP, and Memcached [2, 14, 37, 42]—where a relatively small
request can trigger a significantly larger response (up to ×50 000).
Spoofed source IP addresses [5, 6, 34, 36] allow traffic to be reflected
to the target [55]. Thus, attacks are increasing in size and sophistica-
tion [1]. A few years back, the largest reported attacks peaked just
below 300 Gbps [39, 40], whereas DDoS attacks have now reached
the Tbps level [3, 26, 37, 58].
Booters as DDoS tool. DDoS-as-a-service providers, also referred
to as booters or stressers, provide a simple web interface and enable
anyone to launch attacks [21, 22] at a low cost of just $0-$5 [10, 11].
On the other end of the scale, booters also claim to offer large-scale
attacks for hundreds of USD [10].

Booter-related work. An extensive body of research on booters
is available. These studies cover multiple lines of research including
analyses of (1) the booters’ leaked databases [10, 21, 23], (2) booter
attacks [8, 24, 47, 57], (3) victims of booters [38], (4) honeypots
of servers commonly used for performing booter attacks [25, 52],
(5) the usage of these honeypots for attribution purposes [31], (6)
TLS certificates used by booters [32], (7) booter blacklists and their
origins [12, 44, 46, 59], (8) the usage of these blacklists to under-
stand the booter market [45], (9) ethical and legal aspects related to
booters [16, 18], and (10) the impact of law enforcement operations
on booters from a commercial perspective [7, 13].
Our contribution. In this first of its kind study, we shed light on
an FBI led operation of 15 booter domains in December 2018 [29, 56].
Instead of analyzing the effect of a financial intervention, we take
an empirical perspective on the impact of this event on the DDoS
attack traffic observed through the lens of three major networks:
tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs, and a major IXP.
Our study takes as its starting point the use of four popular
booters to attack ourselves. This self-attack provides an up-to-date
picture of booter capabilities and is the first study to investigate
premium (VIP) services and their promises. We derive characteris-
tics of these self-attacks to further investigate tier-1 and tier-2 ISP
and IXP network traffic for DDoS attacks. We study spatial and tem-
poral trends and present the existence and extent of DDoS attacks.
This provides an overview of the current DDoS threat landscape.
Finally, our study focuses on network traffic in the time frame of
the FBI takedown, by applying the characteristics we learn from
our self-attack approach and the investigation of network traffic of
our vantage points. In summary, our major contributions are:
• We investigate the anatomy of a booter attack by launching
attacks against our infrastructure. We were able to observe high
attack traffic volumes of up to 20 Gbps.
• We present an overview of the current Internet threat landscape
through the lens of three major networks: tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs
and a major IXP. We observe constant DDoS attacks, at thousands
of victims and traffic rates of up to 600 Gbps.
• We seize the unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of an
FBI takedown targeting 15 booter services in December 2018. The
takedown immediately reduced the DDoS amplification traffic
to reflectors. However, it did not have any significant effect on
DDoS traffic hitting victims or on the number of attacks observed.
2 VANTAGE POINTS
Our study is based on three vantage points—a major IXP, a tier-1 ISP,
and a tier-2 ISP—that provide a unique perspective on DDoS attack
traffic in the wild. None of the data sets contain any payload. In
addition, we perform active measurements of large sets of domains
within an observatory [17] to identify booter websites.
Major IXP. Anonymized and sampled IPFIX traces captured at a
major Internet Exchange Point (IXP) between Oct. 27, 2018 and Jan.
31, 2019 with 834 B flows were made available to us.
Tier-1 ISP. We obtained Netflow traces from all border routers
(ingress only) of a tier-1 ISP. IP addresses are anonymized and
filtered by protocol and port, resulting in 6.6 B flows records for
the period of Dec. 12 to Dec. 30, 2018. The trace contains traffic to
i) fixed-line end-users, ii) cellular customers, and iii) transit traffic.
Traffic from end-users and customers was not included.
Tier-2 ISP. The second ISP dataset was anonymized and filtered in
the same way as the tier-1 ISP. However, ingress and egress traffic is
available in this data, meaning that end-user and customer sourced
traffic is included. This results in 470 M flow records from Sept. 27,
2018 to Feb. 2, 2019.
IXP Observatory. To study booter properties by performing self-
attacks, we set up and operate an IXP-based DDoS observatory.
It comprises a measurement AS operated by us that is connected
to an IXP via a 10GE link. The AS interconnection consists of
multilateral peerings at the IXP and a transit link over the same
physical interface. Data collection is performed directly at the IXP
platform (sampled) and at the measurement AS itself (unsampled).
DNS and HTTPS observatory. To study the rise and fall of booter
websites, we use weekly crawls of all ∼140M .com/.net/.org domains
by obtaining zone files and performing weekly DNS resolutions
and HTTPS website snapshots during January 2018 until May 2019.
The website snapshots enable us to identify booter websites.
3 BOOTER: VICTIM’S PERSPECTIVE
We start by taking a victims’ perspective to study the potential
damage that booter-based DDoS attacks can (a) directly cause to
their target (thereby updating earlier findings on booter attack
characteristics [8, 24, 47, 57]) and (b) the collateral damage to In-
ternet infrastructure caused by carrying attack traffic. We do so by
purchasing services from popular booters to attack our dedicated
measurement infrastructure at an IXP between April and Septem-
ber 2018. This provides us with a unique picture of current booter
service capabilities in the wild: how much DDoS traffic they can
generate in light of powerful Tbps-level attacks. Our study provides
the first look into how reliable the promises of these services are,
e.g., premium membership benefits, promised attack protocols, and
duration. With our measurement infrastructure, we can draw con-
clusions about the DDoS traffic landscape. Ultimately, we utilize
the self-attack to identify attack characteristics to later discover
DDoS attack traffic at our vantage points.
3.1 Self-Attack Approach
Selected booter services. We select 4 popular booters (see Ta-
ble 1) from the booter blacklist [46] based on their Alexa website
rank (booter names anonymized). Two of the selected booters (A
& B) were later seized by the FBI-lead takedown. Three are still in
operation (seized booter A started using a new website after the
takedown). We purchase paid services from all booters including
cheaper (non-VIP) and one more expensive premium package (VIP)
