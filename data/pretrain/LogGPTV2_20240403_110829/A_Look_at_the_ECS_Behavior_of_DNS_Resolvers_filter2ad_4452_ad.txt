7.2 Cache Hit Rate
We now use the All-Names Resolver dataset to study the impact of
ECS on DNS cache hit rate. While this dataset only produces a point
assessment, it still reflects a concrete observation of an operational
busy resolver. Figure 3 shows the hit rate that a resolver would
experience when serving a random fraction of clients of a given
size without ECS (e.g., ignoring any ECS scope from authoritative

responses
queries
five queries for www.youtube.com directly to Google’s authorita-
tive DNS server from a lab machine using dig, one query each using
no ECS, an ECS prefix matching the lab machine’s IP address, and
the three most common unroutable ECS prefixes mentioned above.
From the responses, we harvest the returned IP addresses of edge
servers that Google maps our lab machine to with the varying ECS
option. Note that sending a single query with each variation of ECS
option is sufficient because our lab machine interacts directly with
the authoritative name server and thus the responses represent
the answers that a real resolver would get when sending a similar
query, regardless of caching or any other implementation details at
the authoritative nameserver.
We receive the same set of 16 IP addresses for the first two
queries (in different permutations) but different sets of IP addresses
for the queries with unroutable ECS prefixes, and these sets do not
overlap with the 16-address set or with each other. Thus, sending
an unroutable ECS prefix results in different answers for Google’s
authoritative DNS server than the answers one would receives
without ECS or with ECS matching the source IP address.
We then test if the quality of user-to-edge-server mapping is
affected. Table 2 shows the ping RTT from the lab machine used
to issue the queries (located in Cleveland, OH) to the first IP ad-
dress returned by the authoritative nameserver and the location
of this IP address that we determine from the hostnames of the
nearby hops from traceroutes (the traceroute was unresponsive
near the address returned for the query with the 127.0.0.0/24 prefix,
and we geolocated this address using EdgeScape, a commercially
available geolocation service [15], instead). The RTT values reflect
the average of 8 pings. The table shows that sending no ECS or
ECS matching the lab machine’s IP address results in mapping to
a nearby edge server in Chicago. On the other hand, sending un-
routable ECS prefixes results in mapping across the globe. Clearly,
submitting unroutable ECS prefixes can result in a very substantial
penalty in mapping quality and must be viewed as a performance
bug6. To avoid negative impact on their clients, the resolvers should
either convey its own IP address in the ECS option or omit the ECS
option instead. We also believe that the RFC should explicitly direct
resolvers to use their own public IP addresses, the same that is used
to send the query, when they wish to insert an ECS option without
disclosing client information. This would eliminate grey areas and
avoid divergence in ECS implementations between resolvers and
authoritative nameservers.
6While the RFC recommends that authoritative nameservers treat unroutable prefixes
in queries’ ECS options as the resolvers’ own identity, it uses the word “SHOULD”,
and – as our findings show – not all servers follow this recommendation.

8.2 Using Hidden Resolvers
We noticed that around half of the ECS-enabled queries in our Scan
dataset carried an ECS prefix that covers neither the open ingress
IP address we probed nor the recursive (egress) IP address that
communicated with our authoritative nameserver. This suggests
that those IP addresses in the client subnet belong to intermediary
resolvers between ingress resolvers and recursive resolvers, often
referred to as hidden resolvers [20, 22, 27] because they were previ-
ously believed to be unobservable7. Thus, ECS can help to uncover
an additional component in the DNS ecosystem that was previously
hidden from observation. We find 32170 different potential hidden
resolver prefixes in the Scan dataset, representing 198 countries and
7.2K ASes8. Out of the 32170 prefixes, we find that 31011 prefixes
are conveyed by the resolvers of the major public DNS service.
We attempt to validate that the discovered ECS prefixes cor-
respond to hidden resolvers as follows. First, we exclude source
IP spoofing as a possible confounding factor because our scanner
received responses to most of the queries that discovered those
hidden ECS prefixes. Next, using the Public Resolver/CDN dataset,
we verify that the prefixes we discover from the Scan dataset belong
to actual hidden resolvers. We leverage the observation that the
major Public DNS service discards any ECS option in the incoming
queries and replaces it with the actual prefix of the query sender
before sending the query to the major CDN authoritative name-
servers9. Thus, the ECS prefixes in the Public Resolver/CDN dataset
represent actual query senders. It turned out that we could find
a vast majority of those presumed hidden ECS prefixes from the
scan dataset in the Public Resolver/CDN dataset. Specifically, we
find that out of the 31011 potential hidden prefixes conveyed by
the resolvers of the major public DNS service, 28892 prefixes are
present in the Public Resolver/CDN dataset. Similarly, 815 prefixes
out of the 1159 potential hidden prefixes conveyed by the other
resolvers (i.g., not belonging to the major public DNS service) are
present in the Public Resolver/CDN dataset. Overall, 29707 out of
32170 hidden prefixes in the Scan dataset are found in the Public
Resolver/CDN dataset and thus belong to actual resolvers.
Regardless, even if some of these ECS prefixes do not belong
to physical hidden resolvers but represent pre-configured ECS set-
ting in the egress resolver, an authoritative nameserver will use
this information when mapping the user to the nearest content
server. Therefore, we investigate whether these prefixes provide a
good approximation of the location of the open forwarders whose
queries contained those prefixes10. Since a forwarder may use sev-
eral hidden resolvers and a hidden resolver may use several re-
cursive resolvers, we consider unique combinations of (open for-
warder, hidden resolver, recursive resolver) in the Scan dataset.
7We caution against inferring the general prevalence of hidden resolvers from their
prevalence in the Scan dataset as the dataset can be biased from being limited to open
ingress resolvers.
8Since recursive resolvers report the hidden resolvers information at the /24 prefix
level, the actual number of hidden resolvers can be greater than 32170
9We also note that the major public resolver exhibited the same behavior with our
experimental authoritative nameserver at the time of the Scan experiment, i.e., it didn’t
accept ECS prefixes we submitted in our queries and replaced them with the source IP
address of the requester before sending them to our authoritative nameserver.
10An orthogonal question is whether the forwarders provide good approximation for
the end-device. While outside the scope of our work, we note that [27] found evidence
that most forwarders are residential networking devices and thus typically colocated
with end-devices.

Figure 4: Distance between forwarders and hidden and re-
cursive resolvers (MP resolvers).
Figure 5: Distance between forwarders and hidden and re-
cursive resolvers (non-MP resolvers).
Using EdgeScape [15], we measure the distance between the for-
warder and the hidden resolvers as well as between the forwarder
and the recursive resolver. Given the prominence of the major
public resolver represented in the Public Resolver/CDN dataset (re-
ferred to in this section as “MP resolver” for brevity), we divide the
results into two cases, studying the major public resolver (referred
to in this section as “MP resolver” for brevity) separately from other
recursive resolvers.
Case 1 (MP resolvers): We find 725K unique (forwarder, hidden
resolver, recursive resolver) combinations where the recursive re-
solvers belongs to MP. We observe that in 57.7K (8%) combinations,
the hidden resolvers are farther away from the forwarders than
the recursive resolvers are. This means that a CDN’s edge server
selection without ECS, using the egress resolver location, would be
based on better understanding of the client location than with ECS,
using the hidden resolver location. In other words, ECS handicaps,
rather than facilitates, server selection in these cases by delivering
a worse client location approximation to the authoritative DNS.
To convey the extent of this problem, Figure 4 shows a hexbin
scatter plot of the geographic distances from the forwarder to the
hidden (F-H) and recursive resolvers (F-R). Points below the diag-
onal (8% of the combinations) indicate that the hidden resolver is
farther away from the forwarder than the recursive resolver. One
can see that the difference between these distances can be great, on
the order of thousands of kilometers. For instance, in one combina-
tion, we find that the distance between the forwarder and recursive
resolver is 0 km (as both are in Santiago, Chile). However, the hid-
den resolver is in Italy, 12000 km away from the forwarder. We
verified the correctness of geolocation by using traceroutes to the IP
addresses of the forwarder, hidden resolver (padding the ECS prefix
with random bits), and recursive resolver. Further, we observe this
same combination of the hidden and recursive resolvers in a query
in the Public Resolver/CDN dataset. Therefore, this example repre-
sents a configuration, verified to be in use, where ECS prevents the
CDN from providing any meaningful user-to-edge-server proximity
mapping.
Further, there are 9.7K (1.3%) combinations lying on the diagonal,
meaning that the forwarder is equidistant from the hidden and re-
cursive resolver. In these combinations, ECS – while not hampering
authoritative nameserver’s understanding of client location – does
not improve its understanding. Even when ECS is still helpful in the
presence of hidden resolvers, a hidden resolver can greatly diminish
ECS utility. Indeed, as the figure shows, among the 90.7% of the
combinations above the diagonal (i.e., where the hidden resolver is
closer than the recursive resolver to the forwarder and therefore
improves the approximation of the forwarder’s location), the hid-
den resolver can still be thousands of kilometers away from the
forwarder. ECS benefits would greatly improve if it would carry
the forwarder’s prefix rather than the hidden resolver’s. It may
appear that a way to achieve this is to adopt ECS along the entire
resolution path and make all resolvers along the path copy the ECS
prefix as they forward the query towards the authoritative name-
server. Unfortunately, to prevent spoofing, many recursive resolvers
(including the MP resolver at the time of the study) override any
ECS information in received queries with the ECS prefix derived
from the source IP address of the immediate query sender, before
submitting the query to the authoritative server. We conclude that
to obtain the most benefits from ECS, the users should connect
to ECS-enabled recursive resolvers directly, rather than through
intermediaries.
Case 2 (Non-MP resolvers): The non-MP resolvers exhibit the
same trends. We find 217K unique combinations of (forwarder,
hidden resolver, recursive resolver) with recursive resolvers that do
not belong to MP Public DNS. Of this number, 17K (7.8%) have the
egress resolver closer to the forwarder compared to hidden resolver,
entailing a detrimental effect of ECS on user mapping, 42.3K (19.5%
have the same distance from the forwarder to both hidden and
recursive resolvers (including 18.45K combinations where all three
parties are placed by EdgeScape in the same location), and the
remaining 157.7K (72.7)% combinations contain a hidden resolver
that is closer to, and hence provides better approximation for the
location of, the forwarder than the recursive resolver is. In other
125

words, ECS improves the authoritative nameserver’s understanding
of the client location in only 72.7% of the combinations, has no effect
on this understanding in 19.5%, and worsens it in 7.8% of the cases.
Figures 5 shows the hexbin scatter plot for the distances between
the forwarders and their hidden and egress recursive resolvers. As
annotated on the figure, we observe many combinations where the
forwarder and recursive are nearby while the hidden resolver is
∼1000 km away. Similarly, we observe many combinations where
the forwarder and hidden resolver are nearby while the recursive
resolver is ∼1000 km away. We find that this combinations corre-
spond to recursive resolvers in Shanghai while the hidden resolver
and forwarder can be in either Beijing or Shanghai (the distance
between Beijing and Shanghai is ∼1000 km). There are also many
combinations where the distance from forwarder to recursive re-
solver is ∼2000 km which we find to be forwarders in Beijing and
recursive resolvers in Guangzhou. We believe that the prominence
of these distances is mostly a product of the skew in ECS support
towards China and the fact that Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou
are the three largest cities in the country. The overall distances be-
tween forwarders and resolvers, as well as location approximation
penalties due to hidden resolvers tend to be somewhat lower than
in the case of the MP resolver but are still substantial.
The overall take-away point from these results is that hidden re-
solvers can interact with ECS to negate ECS benefits and sometimes
even turn ECS from a facilitator into a handicap for the authoritative
nameservers’ ability to conduct effective traffic engineering. One
way to avoid potential performance degradation is for the parties
involved (ISPs, DNS resolution service provides, and client sites) to
consider carefully the relative location of clients, hidden resolvers,
and egress resolvers before adopting ECS, and either avoid using
hidden resolvers with misleading locations or avoid including ECS
prefixes for queries coming from those hidden resolvers. Another
way is to develop trust between hidden and egress resolvers (which
are sometimes operated by different organizations) so that hidden
resolvers would include ECS prefixes based on end-client subnets,
and egress resolvers would pass this information (provided it comes
from the trusted senders) to the authoritative nameservers, rather
than replacing it with prefixes based on the sender IP addresses.
8.3 Using Improper Source Prefix Length
As we observe in Section 6.2, different resolvers submit different
ECS prefix lengths with their queries. We already discussed that
using more than 24 bits in the ECS prefixes counters RFC recommen-
dation. We now investigate whether sending ECS source prefixes
with fewer than 24 bits would have an impact on the quality of
user-to-server mappings for the answers returned by authoritative
DNS servers. This question was previously considered by Otto et
al. through measurements embedded in an application on end-user
devices [23]. Based on the measurements of mappings by Google
authoritative DNS, the authors concluded that increasing the prefix
length from /16 to /24 provided only small extra benefits but also
noted that other CDNs may show different results. We consider
two major CDNs that support ECS from non-whitelisted hosts, de-
noted CDN-1 and CDN-2, and observe the impact of prefix length
is different from that reported in [23].

We use RIPE Atlas measurement platform [26], which provides
programmatic access to over ten thousand measurement points
throughout the world, to conduct our study. We randomly select
800 IP addresses of RIPE Atlas probes, resulting in a sample cov-
ering 174 countries and 599 autonomous systems. Because Atlas
does not support ECS queries, we use our lab machine to submit
