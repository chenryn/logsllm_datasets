When editing the profiles.json settings file, it is currently not possible to
specify more than one defaultProfile. As a result, it is not possible to have
the Terminal automatically start up with more than one tab. It would be
extremely convenient, to be able to specify the 3 or 4 most commonly used
command-line environments to all open up in separate tabs every time Terminal
is started. This would e.g. give users the ability to always open up a Command
Prompt, PowerShell, and Ubuntu shell all at the same time.
