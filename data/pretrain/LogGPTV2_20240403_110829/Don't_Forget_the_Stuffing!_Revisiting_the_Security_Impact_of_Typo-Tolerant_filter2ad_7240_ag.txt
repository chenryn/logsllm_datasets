Table 7: The effectiveness of password spraying attacks when password typo-tolerance is disabled (CNone) compared with using
the CTop5 typo-tolerance policy, across different datasets and different numbers of attack queries ùëû. For each leak, we evaluate
attack success on all emails (labeled as All) and only emails with multiple passwords (labeled as Multi), using the upper bound
and lower bound attack success metrics. For ease of comparison, the CTop5 attack success metrics are the percentage point
increases/deltas (as indicated by the + sign) in password spraying success over CNone, rather than the total attack success rate.

Table 9: The performance of the password classifier models
on the holdout test dataset, trained on data labeled using a
0% label threshold. We evaluate the five policy models each
tuned to varying recall operating points, and determine the
proportion of emails whose randomly selected password is
flagged as susceptible by our models, as well as the models‚Äô
false positive and false negative rates.
