User: List the commonly used load balancing algorithms you know, and analyze their characteristics, advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: 1. Round Robin Features: Evenly distribute requests to each server; simple and easy to implement, without algorithmic decisions. Advantages: simple to implement, without excessive calculation burden, and suitable for situations where the request volume is relatively balanced. Disadvantage: If the server performance is different, the round-robin algorithm will put the lower performance server under more pressure, affecting the overall quality of service. 2. Least Connections algorithm (Least Connections) Features: Select the server with the least number of connections according to the current number of connections; choose a relatively stable server. Advantages: The service can be adaptively adjusted according to the server load, and the load can be distributed more evenly. Disadvantages: It cannot cope with the sudden increase of requests in a short period of time, which may easily cause the server to crash. 3. IP Hash method (IP Hash) Features: The source IP address is mapped to the specified server; the same IP address is mapped to the same server, which can ensure that the request of the same client is forwarded to the same server. Advantages: good balance, suitable for dynamic web pages, and no state flags on the server, less pressure on the back-end server. Disadvantages: When adding or deleting servers, a large number of mappings may become invalid, requiring remapping and reducing balance. 4. Random algorithm (Random) Features: Randomly select a server to process the request. Advantages: simple to implement, and can handle situations where the number and performance of servers are not known in advance. Disadvantages: Randomness may cause a certain server to be heavily stressed, while other servers are lightly loaded, which may lead to unbalanced load of the entire system. 5. Scheduling algorithm based on resource weight (Weighted Round Robin) Features: Set weights for servers according to different processing capabilities of servers. Advantages: The weight can be adjusted according to the actual performance of each server to achieve load balancing. Disadvantage: The set weight needs to be adjusted by real-time monitoring of the load of the server, and the management cost is high. If a server goes down, load imbalance issues may arise.
