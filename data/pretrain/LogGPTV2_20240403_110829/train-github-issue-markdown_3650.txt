I am only able to dismiss one dismissible at a time, if I try to dismiss in a
rapid-fire (swiping fast) fashion it will keep the previous state, because we
have to set the state (in onDismissed) the state update will prevent the last
fired dismissible to dismiss. It seems like dismissing fast is too fast for
the state updates to take place.
In apps like gmail, it is possible to rapid-fire dismiss items I wonder how it
is done there.
I tried to update state at a later time but I get the key exception (a
dismissed widget is still part of the tree)
