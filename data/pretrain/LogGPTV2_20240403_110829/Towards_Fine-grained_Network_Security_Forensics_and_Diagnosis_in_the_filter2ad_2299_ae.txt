### ForenGuard: Overview and Functionality

ForenGuard is a tool designed to enhance the security and diagnostic capabilities of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments. It operates by first identifying forwarding graphs for user flows and detecting flow rules that drop packets from specific users. Subsequently, it traces the control plane execution to identify the messages that generate these flow rules. This process allows ForenGuard to pinpoint the Firewall application and observe the flow rules that trigger packet drops, as well as the variable rules configured via the REST API.

### Overhead and Scalability

ForenGuard integrates logging code into the SDN controller, which introduces some overhead to the control plane. To quantify this overhead, we measure two key performance metrics: throughput and latency. 

- **Throughput Overhead**: We use the Cbench tool to generate a large number of new flow events and evaluate the maximum processing rate in the control plane.
- **Latency Overhead**: We evaluate the delay in processing two common OpenFlow messages: PacketIn and StatsReq/Res. The PacketIn message is triggered by new flows or flow entry matches and sent from the data plane to the control plane. The StatsReq/Res message is used by the control plane to query flow statistics from the data plane.

To measure the delay in processing PacketIn messages, we use a machine with two network cards. One card continuously sends network packets, while the other card captures and processes these packets, allowing us to measure the delay accurately.

### Discussion and Future Work

ForenGuard represents a significant step towards a comprehensive network security forensics and diagnosis system in SDN. However, it has several limitations and areas for future improvement:

- **Threat Model**: Currently, we do not assume malicious SDN apps due to their rigorous vetting. Future work will address potential vulnerabilities and detection of malicious apps.
- **Extension to Other Controllers**: While ForenGuard is designed for Java-based controllers, extending it to non-Java controllers and distributed controller models (e.g., ONOS) is a future goal.
- **Accuracy of Static Analysis**: Our current implementation relies on Soot, which has known accuracy limitations. Future research could improve static analysis techniques.
- **Optimization**: There is room for optimizing storage and leveraging compression schemes, such as those proposed by VAST [40].

### Conclusion

ForenGuard is a pioneering tool that integrates both control and data plane diagnostics in SDN. It dynamically records fine-grained activities, builds event-oriented execution traces, and provides diagnosis functions to locate suspicious activities and root causes of forwarding problems. Evaluation results show that ForenGuard is effective and adds only acceptable runtime overhead to the SDN control plane.
