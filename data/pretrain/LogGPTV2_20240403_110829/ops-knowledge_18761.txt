User: How to Harden Linux Servers to Prevent Unauthorized Access and Attacks?
Assistant: It is very important to harden the security of Linux servers to prevent unauthorized access and attacks. The following are some common security reinforcement methods: 1. Update the system: keep the system updated and install the latest system patches and update programs to prevent attacks from known vulnerabilities. 2. Configure the firewall: use the firewall to restrict remote access and intrusion, and only allow specific network traffic to pass through. 3. Install security software: Install antivirus, firewall, and other security software that can detect and block malware, viruses, and intrusions. 4. Disable unnecessary services: Closing unnecessary services can reduce the attack surface and system burden. 5. Use strong passwords: Use strong passwords to prevent passwords from being guessed and cracked. 6. Configure SSH: Configure SSH to restrict user access, and security settings such as key authentication and non-root login can also be used. 7. Configuration logs: Installation and configuration logging can track system activities, detect and warn of malicious behavior in time. In addition to the measures listed above, there are other basic security measures, such as restricting access to specific directories and files, disabling or deleting system default accounts and passwords, etc. It should be noted that the system setting is not completed at one time, and the administrator needs to regularly check the system security and update patches in time.
