##### SUMMARY
When attempting to recreate an issue noticed in AWX, I ran:  
ansible-inventory --list -i og/hosts  
to try to list my inventory file.
I did recreate my issue, however the error message I received actually
contained my coworkers CORP account password in clear text:
ERROR! Unexpected Exception, this is probably a bug: Cannot json serialize
_corp password here_
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Have a .yml in your host file directory which contains a vault encrypted
string. Run the above command targeting your inventory file.
Based on my testing it's literally any vault encrypted strings and my coworker
was unlucky enough that the first string encountered was his corp password.
    ansible-inventory --list -i hosts
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
list my inventory the way ansible sees it
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
unsecured coworker
    ERROR! Unexpected Exception, this is probably a bug: Cannot json serialize *corp password here*
