waveform and the original waveform are. Based on cosine
similarity, a metric obfuscation factor (denoted by g) is deﬁned
as follows:
g =1 − similarity = 1 − cos(θ)
(cid:11)
=1 − u(t) · r(t)
n(cid:10)
(cid:7)u(t)(cid:7)(cid:7)r(t)(cid:7) =

i=1
u(ti)r(ti)
(cid:11)
n(cid:10)
i=1
u(ti)2
r(ti)2
i=1
where r denotes the original reactive power and u denotes the
obfuscated reactive power given by RPO. It is easy to see that
g measures the difference between the original waveform and
the obfuscated waveform. The goal of RPO is to obfuscate
the waveform as much as possible. Thus, we want g to be as
large as possible. In other words, our obfuscation factor g can

3) Detection Rate: To evaluate the effectiveness of RPO
on mitigating reactive power based attacks, we deﬁne another
metric detection rate, which measures how well the attacker
can identify appliances:
detection rate =
number of accurate detection
number of appliance usage event detected
Since an appliance can be turned on or off, for each appliance,
there are two detection rates, corresponding to the ON and
OFF events.
B. Simulation Setup
To evaluate the performance of RPO, we simulate the
complete system using Cadence’s OrCAD PSpice software
[35]. OrCAD PSpice enables complex circuit design and high-
performance circuit simulation. It supports both digital and
analog circuits. In PSpice, we choose the mixed A/D circuit
mode to set up our designed RPO circuit (as shown in Fig. 13
and Fig. 14). We create waveforms using the load proﬁle data
sets described in Section III-A, and add the waveforms as
signal sources to the circuit (the input shown in Fig. 14). To
capture the obfuscated reactive power waveform, we add a
Power Dissipation Marker at the output line (shown in Fig. 14).
In this way, the waveform we get from the marker will be the
obfuscated reactive power. The results reported below were
collected based on a simulated 10 F capacitor.

Fig. 17: Rc’s effects on the vulnerability factor
Fig. 18: Rc’s effects on the obfuscation factor
an example, Fig. 15 shows a 24 hours-long load proﬁle. The
left ﬁgure is the original reactive power, and the right ﬁgure
is the obfuscated reactive power. The ﬁgures show that after
using RPO, the waveform appears to be more stable. Most of
the time, the obfuscated reactive power stays around 100 V ar
and no appliance usage can be inferred, which means that RPO
is able to mask the reactive power changes caused by turning
ON/OFF appliances.
As shown in the ﬁgure, some ﬂuctuations still occur in
the obfuscated data due to the delay of the storing/providing
process of the capacitor. When the appliance changes state,
it takes some time (about one second) for the capacitor to
fully compensate the change and there will be a very short
ﬂuctuation before the reactive power changes back to 100 V ar.
However,
these short ﬂuctuations will not reveal detailed
appliance usage information such as which appliance is turned
ON/OFF. This is because the reactive power before the ﬂuctu-
ation is not the true reactive power consumption of the home
appliance, and it is set to be 100 V ar by RPO. Since the
starting reactive power is different, the reactive power change
is not related to the power consumption of the appliance.
Moreover, this ﬂuctuation is too short (only about one second)
to extract the wavelet coefﬁcient. Thus, the attacker cannot link
the ﬂuctuation with the appliance correctly. To further validate
this, we perform a wavelet transform on the obfuscated data
and the coefﬁcients are shown in Fig. 16. We can see from
the ﬁgure that the coefﬁcients of the obfuscated data do not
have any pattern and can not be mapped to any appliance.
2) Vulnerability Factor and Obfuscation Factor: The vul-
nerability factor and the obfuscation factor with or without
RPO are shown in Table IV. After applying RPO, the vul-
nerability factor for all three households drop signiﬁcantly
(more than 98%). It means that RPO can effectively reduce
the amount of useful information contained in the reactive
power data and makes it much harder for the attacker to make
inferences. It shows that the obfuscated data and the original
data are signiﬁcantly different and RPO can obfuscate the
original reactive power data very well.
3) Effectiveness of Mitigating Reactive Power-based At-
In this subsection, we run the attacks described in
tacks:
Section IV, based on the original reactive power data and
the obfuscated reactive power data. The results are shown
in Table V. Before applying RPO, the attacker can identify
appliance ON/OFF events with high accuracy. After applying
RPO, the correctness of identifying ON/OFF events is very low
(less than 2%). For example, as shown in the Table, for Apt
1, without RPO, the detection rate for the attacker to identify
Lamp “ON” can reach 95.8%, but this detection rate drops
to 1.2% when RPO is applied. Thus, the results demonstrate
that RPO can prevent attackers from inferring appliance usage

information and hence can preserve user privacy.
4) Effects of initial Rc: The initial target load Rc is an
important factor of RPO. We evaluated the vulnerability factor
and obfuscation factor with different initial Rc and the results
are shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18. As shown in Fig. 17,
the vulnerability factor changes between 0.05 and 0.45 when
the initial Rc changes. The best result appears around 100
to 120 V ar. Note that despite the changes, the vulnerability
factor is always much better compared to 2.307 (the value
when RPO is not applied).
Fig. 18 shows that the obfuscation factor does not change
much (ranged from 0.9985 and 0.9988) when the initial Rc
changes. Its high value indicates that RPO performs well even
when Rc changes.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented a new attack against user privacy
which uses only reactive power data measured by smart
meters. The attack demonstrates that reactive power can be
exploited by attackers to infer appliance usage information
and thus poses bigger threats to user privacy. To address
this problem, we proposed a novel
technique called RPO
to obfuscate the reactive power measured by smart meters.
RPO uses capacitors to store and provide reactive power in a
controlled manner, to smooth power ﬂuctuations, so that the
reactive power changes caused by the ON/OFF of appliances
are hidden from the smart meter. Evaluation results show that
RPO can prevent adversary from exploiting reactive power
data to infer appliance usage information and hence preserve
user privacy.
