User: An existing application uses load balancing to improve performance, but problems occur on some nodes of the application, resulting in performance degradation. Please analyze the problem and solution.
Assistant: The problem may be that the load balancing algorithm does not take into account the health of the nodes, causing the previously failed node to remain within the scope of the load balance, while new requests are routed to this node, resulting in performance degradation. The solution can be to increase the health check mechanism, and when the node is in poor health, exclude it from the load balancing range and rebalance the load. In addition, a monitoring mechanism should also be established to detect and resolve node failures in a timely manner.
