### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:07:57 to 18:08:03 on October 18, documents multiple issues and retries in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process (running on `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`) repeatedly fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` for durations ranging from 180 to 185 seconds.
   - Each failure is logged with a warning, indicating that the system will retry shortly.

2. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process attempts to connect to the Resource Manager (RM) at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The process logs an error each time it fails to contact the RM.
   - It also logs information about retrying the connection, using a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a 1-second sleep interval between attempts.

3. **Address Changes**:
   - Both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect address changes.
   - The old address format includes the IP address (`msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:port`), while the new address format omits the IP (`msra-sa-41:port`).

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Lease Renewal Warnings**:
  - At 18:07:57, 18:07:58, 18:07:59, 18:08:00, 18:08:01, and 18:08:02, the `LeaseRenewer` process fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` for 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, and 185 seconds, respectively.

- **RM Connection Retries**:
  - At 18:07:58, 18:08:00, and 18:08:02, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` process logs that it is retrying the connection to the RM at `msra-sa-41:8030`. Each log entry indicates that no previous attempts have been made and specifies the retry policy.
  - Concurrently, at these same times, the process logs errors indicating that it failed to contact the RM.

- **Address Change Warnings**:
  - At 18:07:58, 18:07:59, 18:08:00, 18:08:01, and 18:08:02, both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect and log address changes, switching from the full IP address to the hostname-only format.

### Conclusion

The log entries indicate ongoing issues with lease renewal and resource manager communication, suggesting potential network or configuration problems. The system is attempting to handle these issues by retrying operations and logging the detected address changes. Further investigation into the network and Hadoop configuration may be necessary to resolve these recurring issues.
