Subject: Resolving Module Augmentation Error in RxJS `d.ts` Files

Hello,

I encountered an error in Visual Studio related to the `d.ts` files located under `node_modules\rxjs\add\observable\`. The specific error message is:

```
Invalid module name in augmentation, module '../../Observable' cannot be found.
```

An example of the problematic code is:

```typescript
declare module '../../Observable' {
```

Could you please advise on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you,
[Your Name]
