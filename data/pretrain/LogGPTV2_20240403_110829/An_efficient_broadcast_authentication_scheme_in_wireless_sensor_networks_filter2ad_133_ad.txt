has four main advantages over µTESLA, which we list below. 
1.
to  buffer  a 
No  time  synchronization  requirement.  In  µTESLA,  the 
sender  and  receivers  utilize  time  synchronization  and 
delayed  disclosure  to  achieve  asymmetry  needed  for 
broadcast  authentication,  while  our  scheme  uses  public-
private  key  pairs.  Thus,  our  scheme  has  no 
time 
synchronization requirement, which may be impractical in 
a large WSN. 
No  buffering  needed  by  receiver.  µTESLA  requires 
receivers 
the 
corresponding  MAC  key  is  disclosed.  Receivers  need  not 
buffer received messages in our scheme. 
Individual  authentication  of  message.  Receivers  can 
individually authenticate a received packet without waiting 
for another packet. In µTESLA, receivers must wait for the 
packet containing the disclosed MAC key. 
Instant  authentication  of  message.  With  our  scheme, 
receivers  can  instantly  authenticate  a  received  packet.  In 
contrast, µTESLA requires a receiver to wait one or more 
time periods for the packet containing the disclosed MAC 
key.

We also compare our scheme against two other efficient one-time 
signature schemes, BiBa [2] and HORS [3]. Testing at the same 
security  level  with  system  parameters  of  t=1024, k=16, r=10,
h=5, our proposed scheme outperformed BiBa and HORS in three 
areas: computation, communication, and storage overhead. Table 
4.1 summarizes the results of our experiment.

5. CONCLUSION
In  this  paper,  we  propose  an  efficient  broadcast  authentication 
scheme  for  wireless  sensor  networks  that  utilizes  a  one-time 
signature scheme and re-keying mechanism. Our scheme exhibits 
many  nice  properties  including individual authentication, instant 
authentication,  robustness  to  packet  loss,  and  low  overhead  in 
computation, communication and storage. We improve upon the 
HORS one-time signature scheme, reducing the large key storage 
requirement  of  HORS  by  using  Merkle  hash  trees  in  generating 
the key pair. Despite increasing computation and communication 
overhead, we significantly decrease the storage space usage. We 

also  devise  a  simple  but  efficient  re-keying  mechanism  for  our 
scheme.
