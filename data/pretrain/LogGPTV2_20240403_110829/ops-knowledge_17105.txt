User: We've been using Trac for task/defect tracking and things were going well enough, but this morning it started serving up a 500 error. Looking in the Apache error_log, I get a stack trace that culminates in:

PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend:
  ExtractionError: Can't extract file(s) to egg cache

The following error occurred while trying to extract file(s) to the Python egg
cache:

  [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/.python-eggs'

The Python egg cache directory is currently set to:

  /.python-eggs

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  You can
change the cache directory by setting the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment
variable to point to an accessible directory

So I explicitly set PYTHON_EGG_CACHE to /srv/trac/plugin-cache. I restarted Apache. Yet I get the same error (it still says "egg cache directory current set to: \n\n /.python_eggs.")
How should I proceed? Is the simplest thing to do to reinstall Trac? If I go that route, what steps do I need to take to ensure that I don't lose existing data?
Assistant: I found that using the PythonOption directive in the site config did not work, but SetEnv did. The environment variable route will also work though.
