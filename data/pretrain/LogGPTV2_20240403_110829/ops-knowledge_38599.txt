User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Method to determine last connection source and date for a SQL Server 2005 Database? So I'm tasked with looking at this old database server to see if any of the databases are in use so we can shut it down. I have a few databases with unidentified usages, if I can somehow see a log or connection history I could check the IP and see the source of the application that is using it. Any ideas?

Assistant: SQL2005 by default only logs failed connections (bad username, etc) and not successful ones. You can use the activity monitor to see any currently active connections, but that's not retro-active.

What we usually do is switch the databases over to READ-ONLY/RESTRICTED ACCESS mode (only DBAs can access the database), and see who starts complaining :)
