## Abstract
Smart homes present unique security, privacy, and usability challenges due to their multi-user, multi-device nature, which affects the physical environment of all inhabitants. Current smart home technology often lacks adequate design for multiple users, including basic access control and other features that make the system intelligible and accessible to all. While previous research has highlighted the issues and needs of smart home users, it remains unclear how to design and build effective solutions, especially in non-adversarial households. This work explores user behaviors, needs, and potential solutions for multi-user security and privacy in generally non-adversarial smart homes. Based on design principles grounded in prior work, we developed a prototype smart home app with features such as location-based access controls, supervisory access controls, and activity notifications. We tested our prototype through a month-long in-home user study with seven households. The results allowed us to re-evaluate our initial design principles, gather user feedback on security and privacy features, and identify challenges and recommendations for smart home designers and researchers.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing adoption of smart devices and platforms, such as Samsung SmartThings, Philips Hue lights, Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Nest thermostats and cameras, has transformed how users interact with and manage their homes. These devices enable remote control, monitoring, and automation, but they also introduce significant security and privacy concerns, particularly in multi-user environments.

### 1.1 Security and Privacy in Multi-User Smart Homes
Smart homes are inherently multi-user systems, with multiple people—partners, roommates, parents, children, guests, and household employees—potentially needing access to and control over smart devices. Prior research has shown that conflicts and tensions can arise even in non-adversarial households. For example, tech-savvy users may unintentionally restrict others from accessing home functions, and privacy concerns can emerge between co-occupants. Unfortunately, current smart home platforms often lack robust access control and privacy features, making it difficult to address these issues effectively.

### 1.2 Designing for Multi-User Security and Privacy
Designing a multi-user smart home that balances security, privacy, and usability is complex. We ask: What goals should a multi-user smart home design aim to achieve? How can these goals be realized? And do these goals and their implementation meet the needs of end users in practice? Our focus is on generally functional households without explicitly adversarial relationships, such as typical tensions between roommates, partners, and parents and children. Addressing more challenging situations, like domestic abuse, is also critical, but even the "easier" cases have not been adequately addressed in prior work or commercial platforms.

### 1.3 Approach and Contributions
To address these questions, we systematized prior work to develop an initial set of design principles for smart homes in non-adversarial multi-user households. We then designed and prototyped a mobile app with features such as location-based access controls, supervisory access controls, and activity notifications. We conducted a month-long in-home user study with seven households to evaluate our design principles and gather insights into user needs and behaviors. Our contributions include:

1. **Design Principles and Prototype:** We propose a set of design principles for security and privacy in multi-user smart homes and develop a prototype based on these principles.
2. **In-Home User Study:** We conduct a month-long in-home user study with seven non-adversarial households to test our design principles and enrich the literature on users' security and privacy needs.
3. **Lessons and Recommendations:** Based on our design experience and user study, we reflect on our proposed design goals and provide technical directions and open questions for future research.

## 2. Background and Motivation
Smart homes raise significant security and privacy challenges, including vulnerabilities in devices and privacy concerns due to ubiquitous recording. We focus on multi-user security and privacy, specifically how users' behavior and usage of the smart home can impact each other's security and privacy. We systematize the multi-user security and privacy issues identified in prior work and the shortcomings of existing approaches.

### 2.1 Multi-User Challenges in Smart Homes
Prior research suggests that smart homes can cause or intensify conflicts and tensions between people living in the home, even in non-adversarial relationships. Key issues include:

- **Power and Access Imbalances:** Tech-savvy users may have more agency and control over the smart home, leading to imbalances and restrictions for other users.
- **Privacy Violations:** Smart homes can expose sensitive information, and users may be unaware of automated notifications or feel a loss of privacy due to smart home logs.
- **Direct Conflict:** Smart homes can be focal points of conflict, such as disagreements over thermostat settings or entryway surveillance.

### 2.2 Additional Actors: Apps and Automations
Third-party apps and automations, such as SmartApps or IFTTT, can complicate multi-user issues. These apps and automations can range from simple rules to more complex integrations with cloud services. They can expose users to physical security risks and privacy violations, and it can be challenging to determine the cause of unexpected behavior in the home.

### 2.3 Shortcomings of Existing Approaches
Despite the growing body of research, existing commercial smart home platforms often lack robust access control and authentication policies. Some platforms support limited access control, while others have minimal or no access control at all. Prior work has provided valuable insights into user preferences, but there have been no direct, in situ evaluations of multi-user smart home access control designs with end users. Our work aims to fill this gap.

## 3. Scope and Research Questions
Our work focuses on generally functional multi-user households, rather than explicitly adversarial situations or cases where users do not belong to a household together. We aim to answer two research questions:

**RQ1:** How should a smart home be designed to address multi-user security and privacy challenges in generally functional households? What design principles and concrete features can help mitigate tensions and disagreements among cooperative co-habitants?

**RQ2:** What security and privacy behaviors and needs do these smart home users exhibit in practice? Do users' behaviors differ from their stated preferences, and do our initial design principles match their needs?

To answer these questions, we designed and implemented a multi-user smart home prototype and conducted a month-long in-home user study with seven households.
