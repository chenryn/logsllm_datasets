Abstract
Smart homes face unique security, privacy, and usability chal-
lenges because they are multi-user, multi-device systems that
affect the physical environment of all inhabitants of the home.
Current smart home technology is often not well designed
for multiple users, sometimes lacking basic access control
and other affordances for making the system intelligible and
accessible for all users. While prior work has shed light on
the problems and needs of smart home users, it is not obvi-
ous how to design and build solutions. Such questions have
certainly not been answered for challenging adversarial situ-
ations (e.g., domestic abuse), but we observe that they have
not even been answered for tensions in otherwise functional,
non-adversarial households. In this work, we explore user
behaviors, needs, and possible solutions to multi-user security
and privacy issues in generally non-adversarial smart homes.
Based on design principles grounded in prior work, we built
a prototype smart home app that includes concrete features
such as location-based access controls, supervisory access
controls, and activity notiﬁcations, and we tested our proto-
type though a month-long in-home user study with seven
households. From the results of the user study, we re-evaluate
our initial design principles, we surface user feedback on se-
curity and privacy features, and we identify challenges and
recommendations for smart home designers and researchers.
1 Introduction
Smart devices and smart home platforms, such as Samsung
SmartThings, Philips Hue lights, Google Home, the Amazon
Echo, and Nest thermostats and cameras, are being increas-
ingly adopted and deployed in the homes of end users. These
devices and platforms allow users to remotely control and
monitor their devices as well as to create automations (e.g.,
automatically locking the door when the user leaves home).
Security and Privacy in Multi-User Smart Homes. Smart
homes are fundamentally multi-user platforms. Multiple
people living in or accessing a home — including partners,
roommates, parents and children, guests, and household em-
ployees — may want or need the ability to use and con-
ﬁgure the smart devices within the home. As prior work
(e.g., [14, 36, 41]) has begun to show, conﬂicts and tensions
may arise between these multiple stakeholders — even in gen-
erally non-adversarial (e.g., non-abusive) households. For ex-
ample, the more tech-savvy users who install smart devices in
their homes may intentionally or unintentionally restrict other
users from accessing home functions (like thermostats) that
were previously physically accessible [14, 41]; privacy con-
cerns and violations may arise between co-occupants [3, 41];
and remote control of devices can be used for harassment [3].
Unfortunately, current smart homes are not yet thoughtfully
designed for interactions between and use by multiple people.
Though prior work has surfaced the need for additional access
control options [16], transparency, and privacy features [41],
many commercial smart home platforms present only sim-
ple security and privacy controls, or even none at all [22].
For example, Samsung SmartThings, a popular smart home
platforms, forces home administrators to choose between pro-
visioning additional accounts with administrator privileges or
not provisioning additional accounts at all [33].
Designing to Address These Challenges. Providing multi-
user smart home security, privacy, and usability is not a
straightforward matter of simply building it, but rather re-
quires careful consideration of a complex design space. We
take a step back to ask: What security, privacy, and other goals
should a multi-user smart home design aim to achieve? How
might it achieve those goals? And do those goals and their
implementation meet the needs of end users in practice?
In this work, we focus speciﬁcally on answering these ques-
tions for generally functional households without explicitly
adversarial relationships. That is, we consider “typical” ten-
sions that may arise between roommates, partners, and parents
and children as they interact with and through a smart home;
we do not consider explicitly adversarial relationships, such as
domestic abuse. Addressing such challenging situations is of
course also critically important, but we observe that even the
seemingly “easy” case has not yet been sufﬁciently addressed

in prior work or today’s commercial platforms.
To begin answering these questions, we thus systematized
prior work to develop an initial set of design principles for
smart homes in generally non-adversarial multi-user house-
holds: access control ﬂexibility, user agency, respect among
users, and transparency of smart home behaviors. Based on
these initial principles, we designed and prototyped a mobile
app for smart home control, which includes concrete features
such as location-based access controls, supervisory access
controls, and activity notiﬁcations.
In-Home User Study and Design Recommendations. To
evaluate how well our proposed design principles and our
prototype’s speciﬁc design choices meet the use cases of real
(non-adversarial) households — and to gain a deeper under-
standing of the multi-user smart home access control needs
and use cases of this class of users — we conducted a month-
long in situ user study. We deployed our prototype with seven
households in the Seattle metropolitan area.
The empirical ﬁndings from our user study allow us to
evaluate and reﬁne our proposed principles for security and
privacy in multi-user smart homes, and we surface technical
directions and open questions for platform designers and re-
searchers, which were not apparent in prior work that did not
conduct in situ design evaluations.
Among our multiple ﬁndings, we found that for some of our
participants, positive household social norms and relationship
dynamics obviated the need for technical access controls. This
ﬁnding suggests directions and questions for future work,
including: How can a smart home platform design leverage
or scaffold these social norms rather than simply existing
alongside them? And how can the platform simultaneously
support use cases and user groups where these social norms
and relationship dynamics are not as positive [3] or (as in the
case of our participant families with teenagers) in tension?
Another ﬁnding surfaced through our user study was that
participants’ varied access control desires required our pro-
totype to support complex combinations of access control
options. Unfortunately, when we increased complexity, it de-
creased usability, potentially discouraging less motivated or
savvy users from using access controls. This ﬁnding raises
the question: how can smart home designers increase the ﬂex-
ibility of smart home access control systems while making
the complexity manageable for all users?
Contributions. Our work makes the following contributions:
1. Design Principles and Prototype: We systematize from
prior work a set of possible design principles for security
and privacy in multi-user smart homes, and we develop
a prototype based on these principles targeting generally
cooperative households.
2. In-Home User Study: We use our prototype to con-
duct a month-long in-home user study with seven (non-
adversarial) households, including couples, roommates,
and families with children of various ages. Our study
serves to both test our proposed design principles in
practice and to more generally enrich the literature on
people’s security and privacy needs, concerns, and prior-
ities in a multi-user smart home.
3. Lessons and Recommendations: Based on our design ex-
perience and in-home study, we reﬂect on our proposed
design goals for multi-user smart homes and surface fu-
ture technical directions as well as open questions for
designers and researchers.
2 Background and Motivation
Smart homes raise signiﬁcant potential security and privacy
challenges. These challenges include, for instance, vulner-
abilities in the devices themselves (e.g., [29]) and privacy
concerns due to ubiquitous recording in the home [6, 21, 42].
In this work, we focus primarily on multi-user security and
privacy: how peoples’ behavior and usage of the smart home
can impact each others’ security and privacy. We begin by
systematizing the multi-user security and privacy issues prior
work has identiﬁed for smart homes, as well as the shortcom-
ings of existing approaches in addressing these issues.
2.1 Multi-User Challenges in Smart Homes
Prior work suggests that smart homes can cause or intensify
conﬂicts or tensions between people living in the home —
even when relationships between people are not explicitly
adversarial (e.g., abusive).
Power and Access Imbalances. One negative dynamic that
emerges from smart homes is a power imbalance between the
person(s) who install(s) and conﬁgure(s) the home, and the
other users who are more passively involved. In the worst-
case — in the context of intimate partner violence — abusers
may have total control over the smart home, enabling harass-
ment and abuse [3]. However, power imbalances also arise
in more benign relationships. For example, Geeng et al. ob-
served how more tech-savvy users have more agency in the
home, including more access to device functionality, more
information about what devices and people in the home are
doing, and the power to restrict others from using devices [14].
Privacy Violations. Smart homes can also intentionally or
unintentionally used to expose privacy sensitive information
about one user to another. Zeng et al. found examples of such
situations, like users being unaware of automated notiﬁcations
sent by cameras to their landlord, and users feeling a loss of
privacy because others could view their behavior through
smart home logs [41]. Choe et al. studied how devices that
capture video, audio, and other behavioral traces could cause
tensions between household members, or between guests and
household members, who would object to being recorded [6].
Direct Conﬂict. Lastly, smart homes can be focal points of
conﬂict between people in the home, both due to explicit
160    28th USENIX Security Symposium

malice (e.g., abuse) and due to ordinary conﬂicts between
household members. For example, prior work has documented
conﬂicts arising due to differences in opinion on thermostat
setting [14, 41], due to conﬂicting goals between parents and
teens in the context of entryway surveillance [36], or due to the
potential use of recorded evidence in household disputes [6].
2.2 Additional Actors: Apps and Automations
The above multi-user issues are compounded by the presence
of additional “actors” in smart home systems: third-party apps
and integrations that users may install (such as SmartApps or
IFTTT), as well as end-user programmed automations. These
apps and automations can range from simple rules (such as
automatically locking the door or turning off lights when
leaving home) to more complex “smart” features that integrate
with other cloud services, e.g. weather data and calendars.
These applications and automations can expose users to
physical security risks and privacy violations. Third-party
applications and automations may be expressly malicious,
or buggy and exploitable (e.g., [11]). Moreover, end users
themselves may make mistakes programming automations,
leading to unexpected behavior, bugs, and potential security
and privacy risks [27,34,39]. In a multi-user smart home, this
combination of actors means that when something unexpected
happens in the home, it may be challenging or impossible
for a user to determine whether it was the result of another
user actuating the smart home remotely, a buggy application
or automation, a legitimate application or automation that
another user installed, or explicitly malicious activity.
2.3 Shortcomings of Existing Approaches
Though many commercial smart home platforms exist, and
a growing body of research literature supports the need to
address the above challenges, we are not aware of existing
approaches that succeed at addressing them and/or have been
rigorously evaluated with end user — neither for explicitly
adversarial settings nor in generally cooperative households.
There are many types of access control policies that
could be used in smart homes, including time-based poli-
cies, location-based policies, per-user policies, and per-device
policies. However, Mare et al. found that adoption of these
techniques in smart home platforms is uneven and limited [22].
Some platforms support a subset of these policies, e.g., Apple
Homekit has location-based access controls, and Vera has
multiple privilege tiers for admins and guests. However, some
popular platforms have minimal or no access control at all:
Samsung SmartThings has only a single privilege level for
all users and no access control policies, while Google Home
and Amazon Echo do not authenticate voice commands. He
et al. [16] and Ur et al. [35] found similar fragmentation of
access control and authentication policies between individ-
ual devices: some devices like door locks had many access
controls, while others like smart thermostats had none.
While having no access controls or user roles at all is clearly
insufﬁcient for user needs (e.g., [33]), the jury is still out
on what are the right access control designs for multi-user
smart homes. To that end, He et al. [16] surveyed hundreds
of participants to understand their smart home access control
preferences, such as which device capabilities people felt need
restrictions (like “deleting door lock logs”) and which types
of device capabilities and people could use special contextual
controls (e.g., allowing children to control devices only when
parents are around). These survey results provide a valuable
basis for future smart home access control designs, but they
still only represent a theoretical view of people’s preferences.
To the best of our knowledge, there have been no direct, in situ
evaluations of multi-user smart home access controls designs
with end users. We aim to close that gap in this work.
3 Scope and Research Questions
Prior work has surfaced many multi-user security and pri-
vacy challenges in current smart home systems. However,
this body of research lacks concrete design proposals that
have been evaluated with end users. We aim to advance our
understanding of this space.
We focus in this work on generally functional multi-user
households, rather than on explicitly adversarial situations
(e.g., domestic abuse) or cases where users do not belong to a
household together (e.g., Airbnb-style rentals). Understand-
ing and designing for these cases is also critical, but different
(and signiﬁcant) challenges exist in designing systems that
are resilient to motivated adversaries with malicious intent,
elevated privileges, and physical device access [23]. We dis-
cuss the ways in which our work may address — but also falls
short of addressing these challenges, in Section 7.4.
Yet prior work has not answered the question of how to
design multi-user smart homes for “typical" households; thus,
in this work, we seek to answer two research questions:
RQ1: How should a smart home be designed to address
multi-user security and privacy challenges (in generally
functional households)? What design principles and con-
crete features may help mitigate tensions and disagreements
among otherwise cooperative (e.g., non-abusive) co-habitants
that stem from multi-user security and privacy issues?
RQ2: What security and privacy behaviors and needs do
these smart home users exhibit in practice? Prior work has
provided some understanding of users’ security and privacy
preferences in the smart home, like preferences for access
controls [16], or examples of undesirable situations [14, 41].
However, these preferences could conﬂict with other priori-
ties, such as utility and convenience. We ask: when presented
with a smart home with more advanced security and privacy
features, how do people (in non-adversarial households) use
them in practice? Do users’ security and privacy related be-

haviors differ from their stated preferences? Do our initial
design principles match their needs?
To answer these research questions, we take a two-part ap-
proach. First, we design and implement a multi-user smart
