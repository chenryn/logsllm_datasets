Question: In a DHCP handshake, why must the 'Client Discover' and 'Client Request' messages be broadcast instead of being sent directly to one server?
"A": "Broadcasting ensures that the client can receive multiple offers and select the best configuration based on the server's load.",
"B": "Broadcasting is necessary because the client does not know the IP address of the DHCP server when it joins the network.",
"C": "Broadcasting allows the client to establish a connection with multiple servers for redundancy and load balancing.",
"D": "Broadcasting is used to prevent other devices on the network from intercepting and tampering with the configuration details."
Answer: B
