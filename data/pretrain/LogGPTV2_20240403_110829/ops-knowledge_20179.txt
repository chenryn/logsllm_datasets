User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Here are some running logs
 0 20:10:55 INFO Started reading broadcast variable 23
 1 20:10:47 INFO mapred.task.partition is deprecated. Instead, use mapreduce.task.partition
 2 20:10:55 INFO Started reading broadcast variable 25
 3 20:10:55 INFO Started reading broadcast variable 27
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi) 和 Slf4jLogger started
B: Started reading broadcast variable <*> 和 mapred.task.partition is deprecated. Instead, use mapreduce.task.partition
C: Changing modify acls to: <*> 和 Starting remoting
D: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi)

Assistant: Answer: B
