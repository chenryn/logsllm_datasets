User: I have this program that at one point accesses os.getcwd(), but some times, depending on where the program has gone before getting to that line, it crashes with the message "OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory". 
I cannot figure out what i can do wrong then calling os.getcwd(). There's no arguments, and there should always be a current working directory, right?
Assistant: It is also possible to get this error when working with an encrypted filesystem and if the partition containing the working directory went back to a "locked" state.  In my case, a README file was available at the mounting point of the partition explaining how to unlock the partition again.  It could depend of the encryption system and settings.
Once the partition unlocked again, to get rid of the error, a change directory is needed to reset the working directory.  Even if the target directory is the directory where you already are.
