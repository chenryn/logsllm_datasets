With version 3.1.0, the HintManagerHolder.clear method is executed each time
SQL is executed?
When using HintShardingAlgorithm, you need to set HintManagerHolder before
executing SQL. I execute multiple SQL in Dao, or execute multiple Dao methods
in a service. I want to set HintManagerHolder in the form of AOP interception
before calling the method. Execute clear after the end, there is no way to
achieve
