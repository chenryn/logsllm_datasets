titleblackhat:us-23 Input Output + Syslog (iO+S): Obtaining Data From Locked iOS Devices via Live Monitoring
Forensic examiners and iOS researchers alike greatly depend on the availability to unlock a mobile device to enable data extraction. This presentation reveals how significant data can be recovered from iOS devices without the need for a password or device unlock.Important device information can be identified through the monitoring of raw data sent via USB protocol. iOS devices present sensitive information in the back end even when this information is not seen by iTunes and third-party software. The presentation demonstrates numerous techniques to facilitate iOS device monitoring and capture of relevant information including live parsing of the data. Attendees will learn how to monitor USB data and capture live system logs including case examples.An additional demonstration includes how the usbmuxd protocol to acquire information via USB can be conjoined with system log monitoring to establish a trusted device connection without the need for a password or device unlock. This presentation includes the release of a brand new freeware toolkit that both gathers and parses live data from iOS devices along with additional device logs which could lead to further exploration and discovery of additional data of value.
