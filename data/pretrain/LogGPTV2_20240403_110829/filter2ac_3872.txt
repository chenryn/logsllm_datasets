### Title: BlackHat US-23: Input Output + Syslog (iO+S): Obtaining Data from Locked iOS Devices via Live Monitoring

**Abstract:**

Forensic examiners and iOS researchers often rely on the ability to unlock a mobile device to extract data. This presentation will reveal how significant data can be recovered from iOS devices without the need for a password or device unlock.

**Key Points:**

1. **Data Recovery Without Unlocking:**
   - The presentation will demonstrate how critical device information can be identified by monitoring raw data transmitted via the USB protocol.
   - Even when sensitive information is not visible to iTunes or third-party software, it can still be accessed through backend processes.

2. **Techniques for Data Extraction:**
   - Attendees will learn various techniques for monitoring iOS devices and capturing relevant information, including live parsing of data.
   - Methods for monitoring USB data and capturing live system logs will be covered, with practical case examples provided.

3. **Advanced Techniques:**
   - An additional demonstration will show how the `usbmuxd` protocol can be used to acquire information via USB, in conjunction with system log monitoring, to establish a trusted device connection without the need for a password or device unlock.

4. **Freeware Toolkit:**
   - The presentation will introduce a new freeware toolkit designed to gather and parse live data from iOS devices, as well as collect additional device logs.
   - This toolkit will enable further exploration and discovery of valuable data.

**Objective:**

By the end of this session, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of how to monitor and capture data from locked iOS devices, and will be equipped with the tools and knowledge to apply these techniques in their own forensic and research work.
