It occurred to me that a neat application of autowiring would be the ability
to autowire logger objects.
Say a class declares something like:
private `@Autowired` Log logger;
where Log is from commons-logging. Spring would then generate a Log object for
the declaring class and then inject it.
I don't think this can be done using the existing resolveResolvableDependency
mechanism, since information about the dependent class isn't made available in
order to create the Log.
Thoughts?
