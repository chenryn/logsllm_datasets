# Introduction to nmrcOS

## Overview
nmrcOS is a Debian-based operating system designed with stability, security, and trust in mind. It caters to a variety of users, including hackers, system administrators, and distribution builders. The project's overall goal is to provide a reliable and secure system that can be trusted for critical operations.

## Intended Users and Uses
- **Hackers**: For testing and developing secure applications.
- **System Administrators**: For managing and securing servers and networks.
- **Distro Builders**: For creating custom distributions based on a robust and secure foundation.

## History of the Project
### Initial Approach
The initial development of nmrcOS focused on addressing common security vulnerabilities and providing a more secure environment for users. 

### Analysis of Problems
The team identified several key issues, including:
- Lack of overflow protection in the kernel.
- Insufficient logging and chroot capabilities.
- Inadequate enforcement of trusted paths.
- Predictable IP IDs, making it easier for attackers to perform certain types of attacks.

### Solution
To address these issues, the nmrcOS team implemented the following changes:
- **Kernel Modifications**:
  - **Linux 2.2.25**: A stable and well-tested version of the Linux kernel.
  - **Openwall Kernel Patch**: Adds overflow protection and other security enhancements.
  - **HAP Linux Kernel Patch**: Improves chroot functionality and adds extra logging.
  - **Trusted Path Enforcement**: Ensures that only trusted processes can access critical system resources.
  - **Random IP IDs**: Makes it harder for attackers to predict and exploit network traffic.

- **Modified Applications**:
  - **Customized Pine 4.56**: Enhanced for better security and usability.
  - **Sendmail 8.12.9**: Chosen for its reliability and rebuilt with "unstable" to include the latest security patches.
  - **Bastille Linux**: Automatically loaded and run by default to further harden the system.

## Noted Features of nmrcOS
- **Debian-Based OS**: Easy to install and supports most hardware.
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Host and network-based intrusion detection.
  - A wide range of security, encryption, and privacy tools.
- **Locked-Down State**: Installs and boots up in a secure configuration by default.

## Demonstration of nmrcOS
- **Live Demo**: A step-by-step demonstration of the installation procedure.
- **Configuration**: How to maintain and upgrade an nmrcOS system.
- **Development**:
  - **Creating Non-Kernel Packages**: Guidelines for developing and packaging non-kernel applications.
  - **Creating Kernel Packages**: Instructions for modifying and building custom kernel packages.
  - **Distributing Your Package**: Best practices for distributing your packages.
  - **Creating Your Own Distro**: Steps to create a custom distribution based on nmrcOS.

## Future of nmrcOS
- **Future Revisions**: Plans for ongoing improvements and updates to the system.
