I recently tried `PI:EMAIL` and I noticed that there's a
regression.
My dependency chain is:  
(my project) <\-- `@babel/preset-stage-0` <\-- `@babel/preset-stage-1` <\--
`@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`
It looks like the pre-beta.35 version of the plugin did opt out because of
this code:
babel/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators/src/index.js
Lines 375 to 381 in a7c9264
|  if (  
---|---  
|  !path  
|  .get("right.callee")  
|  .isIdentifier({ name: state.initializerWarningHelper.name })  
|  ) {  
|  return;  
|  }  
While beta.35 does not opt out at its replacement:
babel/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators/src/index.js
Line 261 in 8a4124b
|  if (!path.get("right.callee").isIdentifier()) return;  
---|---  
(introduced via `9cc0a26`)
I was not able to track it down to a minimum reproducible example yet.  
All I was able to check is that the result of expression
`path.get("right.arguments")` in
babel/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators/src/index.js
Line 268 in 8a4124b
|  path.get("right.arguments")[1].node,  
---|---  
has length of `1`.  
I also checked that adding `if (!path.get("right.arguments")[1]) return;`
prevents the error from being triggered but it was only a blind guess of mine
to add that line there. I'm not aware of the consequences of such move
