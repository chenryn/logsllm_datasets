whenever the redundancy is omitted. Nevertheless, sev-
eral works have shown that redundancy and plaintext-
awareness are not required to achieve chosen-ciphertext se-
curity. The initial results in this direction are due to Phan
and Pointcheval [37, 38]; earlier work by Desai [25] achieves
a similar goal, but in the setting of symmetric encryption.
Libert and Quisquater [33] build a redundancy-free identity-
based encryption scheme that achieves adaptive IND-CCA
security. More recently, Boyen [20] proposes a compact
redundancy-free encryption scheme based on the Gap-Diﬃe-
Hellman problem [35]. Whereas Boyen’s scheme is deﬁnitely
optimal from the point of view of bandwidth, with a 160-bit
overhead only, it is not really eﬃcient because many costly
full exponentiations must be computed for encryption and
decryption.
Formal proofs of cryptographic schemes. The applica-
tion of formal methods to cryptography has a long and rich
history. However, much of the the work in this area has
focused on the formal veriﬁcation of cryptographic proto-
cols in the symbolic model, which assumes that the under-
lying primitives are perfectly secure. A seminal article by
Abadi and Rogaway [1] shows, for the case of encryption,
that symbolic methods are indeed sound for the computa-
tional model, and can thus be used to achieve cryptographi-
cally meaningful guarantees. The computational soundness
result of Abadi and Rogaway has been extended in many
directions; we refer the reader to [22] for a survey on com-
putational soundness.
In contrast, the application of formal proofs to crypto-
graphic schemes is more recent, and less developed. To our
best knowledge, Impagliazzo and Kapron [32] were the ﬁrst
to propose a formal logic to reason about indistinguishabil-
ity. Using this logic, they prove that next-bit unpredictabil-
ity implies pseudo-randomness. However, the logic cannot
handle adaptive adversaries with oracle access. Computa-
tional Indistinguishability Logic [3] is a more recent logic
that overcomes these limitations. Both of these works pro-
vide logical foundations for reasoning about cryptographic
systems, but lack tool support.
In an inspiring article, Halevi [30] advocates that cryp-
tographic proofs should be computer-assisted, and outlines
the design of an automated tool to support cryptographic
proofs that follow the code-based game-playing approach.
CryptoVerif [15] is among the ﬁrst tools to have provided
support for computer-aided cryptographic proofs. It allows
users to conduct, automatically or interactively, game-based
concrete security proofs of primitives or protocols. Games
in CryptoVerif are modeled as processes in the applied π-
calculus, and transitions are proved using a variety of meth-
ods, including process-algebraic (for instance bisimulations)
or purpose-built (for instance failure events) tools. To date,
CryptoVerif has been applied to prove the security of the
Full-Domain Hash signature scheme [17] and several pro-
tocols; we refer to [16] for a more detailed account of the
examples proved with CryptoVerif. The work we report in
this paper uses EasyCrypt [4], a more recent tool that takes
a programming language approach to cryptographic proofs.
EasyCrypt and its predecessor CertiCrypt have been used to
verify a number of emblematic cryptographic schemes, in-
cluding OAEP [5]. As CryptoVerif, EasyCrypt and CertiCrypt
aim to provide general frameworks that capture common
reasoning patterns in cryptography. An alternative is to de-
velop specialized logics, that are able to prove a particular
733property for a given class of schemes. A relevant exam-
ple is the Hoare logic of Courant et al. [23], which allows
to prove automatically that an encryption scheme based on
trapdoor one-way functions, random oracles, concatenation
and exclusive-or is IND-CPA or IND-CCA secure. Their logic
(or a suitable extension) uses a syntactic form of plaintext-
awareness to conclude that an encryption scheme is IND-
CCA secure; hence it cannot be applied to conclude IND-CCA
security of ZAEP.
7. CONCLUSION
ZAEP is a surprisingly simple and eﬃcient padding scheme
that achieves adaptive chosen-ciphertext security without
introducing any redundancy. Using the EasyCrypt tool, we
have built a machine-checked proof that ZAEP yields IND-
CCA security with a rather eﬃcient reduction, whenever it is
instantiated with trapdoor permutations satisfying two in-
tuitive algebraic properties that hold for the Rabin function
and small exponent RSA. The proof is signiﬁcant beyond
its intrinsic interest, as the ﬁrst application of veriﬁed se-
curity to a novel construction. Pleasingly, starting from a
high-level intuition, we were able to build with reasonable
eﬀort in less than a week and directly in EasyCrypt, the se-
quence of games for proving IND-CCA security. The time
needed to complete the proof stands in sharp contrast with
the six man-monthes that were reported needed to repro-
duce the proof of OAEP in CertiCrypt [5]. Thus, our work
provides further evidence that, as stated in [4], “EasyCrypt
makes a signiﬁcant step towards the adoption of computer-
aided proofs by working cryptographers”.
The ZAEP proof opens exciting perspectives for future
work. On the one hand, it suggests that automation can
be signiﬁcantly improved through user-deﬁned and built-in
strategies that automatically generate a sequence of games.
More speculatively, we are currently investigating whether
strategies could provide an eﬀective means to automate IND-
CPA and IND-CCA proofs for encryption schemes obtained
with methods of program synthesis. In a parallel thread of
work, we have implemented a synthesis tool that generates
encryption schemes based on trapdoor one-way permuta-
tions, random oracles, concatenation and exclusive-or.
In
order to limit the set of candidate schemes to examine, we
have constrained the generation mechanism by Dolev-Yao
ﬁlters that eliminate obviously insecure schemes. Thus, the
synthesis algorithm generates a list of candidates that is ex-
haustive up to a given number of operations. Noticeably,
there are only two candidates with a minimal number (four)
of operations:
the (redundant-free and IND-CPA) Bellare
and Rogaway encryption scheme [10], which is known since
1993, and ZAEP, which has not been studied before. The
case of ZAEP makes us hopeful that automated synthesis of
cryptographic schemes may lead to surprising discoveries.
