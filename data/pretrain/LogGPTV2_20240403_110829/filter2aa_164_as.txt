### Installing and Configuring Java for Raspberry Pi

1. **Install Java:**
   - Oracle has developed a version of Java specifically for the Raspberry Pi. For more information, visit the [Java.net website](http://is.gd/L8T7fJ).

2. **Rename the Java Package:**
   - The package name is quite long, so it's recommended to rename it for easier management.
     ```bash
     mv jdk-8-ea-b36e-linux-arm-hflt-29_nov_2012.tar.gz jdk.tar.gz
     ```
   - **Tip:** Use tab completion in Linux to save time when navigating directories and files. Press `Tab` after typing the first few characters of a folder or file name.

3. **Perform Housekeeping and Install Java:**
   - Create the `/opt` directory and extract the Java package.
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /opt
     sudo tar zxvf jdk.tar.gz -C /opt
     rm jdk.tar.gz
     ```

4. **Verify Java Installation:**
   - Check the installed Java version.
     ```bash
     sudo /opt/jdk1.8.0/bin/java -version
     ```

5. **Install Spigot:**
   - Download the latest Spigot build. Note that the URL may change, so keep the [Spigot website](http://is.gd/3nF2tr) bookmarked for the most recent version.
     ```bash
     cd
     sudo wget http://ci.md-5.net/job/Spigot/lastBuild/artifact/Spigot-Server/target/spigot.jar
     ```

6. **Start the Minecraft Server:**
   - Start the server with the following command, which sets the RAM footprint between 128MB and 256MB.
     ```bash
     sudo /opt/jdk1.8.0/bin/java -Xms128M -Xmx256M -jar /home/pi/spigot.jar nogui
     ```
   - The server will generate the Minecraft environment, which may take several minutes. Do not be alarmed by the numerous lines of output in the terminal.

7. **Test the Server:**
   - Start Minecraft on a remote system, click "Multiplayer" (or "Join Game" in Minecraft Pi Edition), and select your Raspberry Pi server from the list.

8. **Connect to the Server:**
   - Double-click the Pi server in the list to log in.
   - If you want to make your server accessible over the Internet, configure your router to forward traffic on TCP port 25565. See [Chapter 15, "Raspberry Pi Web Server"] for more details.

### Administering a Minecraft Server

- **Basic Commands:**
  - Type `help` in the Minecraft server console to get a list of commands.
  - A Minecraft server operator (OP) has full control over the server. To make a user an OP, use the `op` command in the server console.

- **Configuring the Server:**
  - Stop the server and open the `server.properties` file using `nano`.
    ```bash
    sudo nano /home/pi/server.properties
    ```
  - Review the [Minecraft Wiki](http://is.gd/awZBsZ) for a detailed explanation of each property.

- **In-Game Commands:**
  - Use `/me` to send a status message to all players.
  - Use `/tell` to send private messages.
  - For example, to set the time to dawn, use:
    ```bash
    /time set 0
    ```
  - Visit [MinecraftServerHost.net](http://is.gd/ttSr5H) for a comprehensive list of commands.

### Minecraft Plugins

- **Installing Plugins:**
  - Download the plugin `.JAR` file and place it in the `plugins` directory.
  - Restart the server to apply the changes.

### Setting Up a Raspberry Pi Web Server

#### What Is a Web Server?

- A web server serves content using standard Internet protocols, making it accessible across various devices.
- Content types include web pages, images, audio, movies, and interactive elements.

#### Standard Web Protocols

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The base protocol for web servers.
- **IP (Internet Protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** Other essential protocols for web communication.

#### LAMP Stack

- **LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP):** A popular open-source web development stack.
- **Components:**
  - **Linux:** The operating system.
  - **Apache:** The HTTP server software.
  - **MySQL:** The relational database management system.
  - **PHP:** The scripting language for dynamic web content.

#### Installing the LAMP Stack on Raspberry Pi

1. **Install Apache, PHP, and the necessary libraries:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5
   ```

2. **Restart the Apache service:**
   ```bash
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

3. **Verify the default Home page:**
   ```bash
   cat /var/www/index.html
   ```

4. **Access the Home page via a browser:**
   - Open Midori and navigate to `http://localhost`.

5. **Verify PHP Configuration:**
   - Create a PHP info file:
     ```bash
     cd /var/www
     sudo nano phpinformation.php
     ```
   - Add the following line to the file:
     ```php
     <?php phpinfo(); ?>
     ```
   - Save and exit, then navigate to `http://localhost/phpinformation.php` in Midori.

6. **Install MySQL:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql
   ```
   - Set a strong password for the MySQL root user during installation.

7. **Verify MySQL Installation:**
   ```bash
   sudo /etc/init.d/mysql status
   ```

#### Tweaking Web Server Settings

- Common tweaks include changing the content storage location, modifying the default TCP port, and adjusting security and performance settings.
