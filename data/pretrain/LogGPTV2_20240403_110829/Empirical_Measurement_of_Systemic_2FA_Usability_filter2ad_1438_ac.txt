### Table 2: Causes of Aborted and Failed 2FA Ceremonies at UCB

The table below shows the percentage of total errors for each specific type of 2FA failure at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB). The leading causes of 2FA failures were timeouts (No Response) and users cancelling their authentication ceremony (User Cancelled). Incorrect passcodes, which include mistyped passcodes from SMS, the help desk, a hardware token, or a backup passcode, were the next leading cause. 

- **Timeouts (No Response):** 0.16%
- **User Cancelled:** 0.01%
- **Incorrect Passcodes:** 0.02%
- **No Keys Pressed:** 100%
- **Deny Unenrolled User:** 1,159,079
- **User Mistake/Fraud:** 100%
- **Anomalous Push:** 100%
- **Error (Miscellaneous):** 100%

#### Detailed Explanation

- **Timeouts (No Response):** This indicates that the user did not respond to the 2FA request within the allotted time.
- **User Cancelled:** The user explicitly cancelled the 2FA process.
- **Incorrect Passcodes:** Users entered incorrect passcodes, which could be due to mistyping.
- **No Keys Pressed:** A user or their voicemail answered the phone but did not send a keypress to authorize access.
- **Deny Unenrolled User:** This error is triggered when someone is forced to start using 2FA but has not yet set up any second factors.
- **User Mistake/Fraud:** If users dismiss a Duo Push notification, they can choose to mark the event as a "User Mistake" or fraud.
- **Anomalous Push:** Only UCB enabled a feature to block multiple push notifications from being sent at once. Blocked duplicate requests failed with this code.
- **Error (Miscellaneous):** This category includes other miscellaneous errors.

### Recovery Times and User Experience

Average recovery times at both organizations were between 10 and 100 seconds. The full distribution is shown in Figure 5. However, the median recovery time is split between the 10-100 and the 10,000–100,000 seconds range (approximately 3-28 hours). This indicates that individual users’ recovery times are left-skewed. For 40% of users, it takes several hours before they successfully log in again (by their individual median response times). The worst 20% of users' median recovery times suggest that their failed or aborted logins were not successfully retried until at least the next day. These delays may indicate a productivity cost if important tasks are postponed or forgotten.

#### Example from a Support Ticket

A user wrote in a support ticket:
“Today around 2:20pm I attempted to log into the wiki. I selected Duo Push. Nothing appeared on my phone and after about a minute of sitting and waiting, I got this response: Login timed out... I pushed Send Me a Push again and got this message: Shibboleth has encountered an error... After that, I started over and everything worked that time. (But I have forgotten why I was going to the wiki.)” (HELPDESK-2003)

### 4.5 Problems Causing Support Tickets

Some 2FA-related problems were significant enough that users created tickets with the engineering help desk. We conducted a qualitative analysis on support tickets supplied by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) using the grounded theory approach. We iteratively performed open coding on a random subset of 6,721 tickets to design a codebook containing 13 codes. The subset size was 200, and a different subset was drawn at each iteration to avoid sampling bias. Using the resulting codebook, we applied the codes to another random subset of 500 tickets. The results of this process are shown in Table 3. Two researchers independently coded the dataset, yielding a Kupper-Hafner agreement score of .79, indicating substantial agreement.

### 4.5.1 Enrollment and Setup Issues

The highest proportion of all support tickets (34.40% ± 5.48%) were related to 2FA enrollment and setup issues. Many users were confused about the nature of 2FA and unable to identify it as a source of error when performing their ordinary tasks. Therefore, a lot of support effort was aimed at explaining what 2FA is and how to initially set it up.

#### Example from a Support Ticket

“I am having trouble getting into my school email. I keep getting this message: ‘Access Denied. The username you have entered cannot authenticate with Duo Security. Please contact your system administrator.’ I wondered if you could help.” (HELPDESK-5216)

### 4.5.2 Updates and Recovery Issues

Another major source of issues (13.80% ± 3.98%) arose when existing users of 2FA had to register a new device or update their phone number. In many cases, users were locked out of their accounts as they did not have access to their previous device or old phone numbers. In these instances, users had to reach out to support staff to obtain a bypass code, which allowed them to access their 2FA settings.

#### Example from a Support Ticket

“This person has a new phone number to authenticate with for 2FA. I had TL [PII] send them a bypass token and gave them instructions for updating their account’s phone number.” (HELPDESK-2207)

### 4.5.3 Second Factors and Availability Issues

When it comes to second factors chosen by users, 51 support tickets (10.20% ± 3.49%) focused on issues with telephony (calls and SMS), 26 (5.20% ± 2.56%) were related to the Duo Mobile app, and 18 (3.60% ± 2.15%) were centered on the hardware token. Device availability was a major theme, with 8.40% ± 3.20% of tickets mentioning this issue. While all second factors could be affected by a lack of availability, most users experienced problems when they left their device at home or could not receive a call or text (due to lack of cellular service, international travel, etc.).

#### Example from a Support Ticket

“I need to log on ASAP but I don’t have access to my phone. There appears to be no option to bypass or send a temporary [PII] to my email address.” (HELPDESK-5710)

### 4.5.4 Miscellaneous Issues

Other support tickets covered a wide range of topics, including assistance setting up a new type of second factor (3.20% ± 2.03%), un-enrollment requests (2.00% ± 1.62%), and feedback (3.20% ± 2.03%). We applied the code 'feedback' to tickets that included feature requests, policy complaints, and negative opinions.

#### Example from a Support Ticket

“2FA is important for critical/sensitive systems and when accessing systems from off campus, but to implement it across the board for all systems is too much. It’s too invasive and starts interfering with productivity. Sometimes the cure in fact IS worse than the disease.” (SEC-41)

### 4.5.5 Comparison to Related Work

Colnago et al. reported help desk ticket classification statistics provided by Carnegie Mellon University’s (CMU) technical support staff. While 2FA help desk tickets were normally less than 5% of their help desk’s workload, they swelled to 25% during the mandatory 2FA adoption period. They did not have access to the ticket text, and thus limited their analysis to the categorization done by the support staff.
