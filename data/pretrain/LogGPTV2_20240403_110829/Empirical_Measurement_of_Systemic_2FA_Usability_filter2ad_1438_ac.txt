Table 2: Causes of Aborted and Failed 2FA Ceremonies at UCB—The fraction shown is the fraction of total errors at that university which
were of each speciﬁc type. The leading causes of 2FA failures were timeouts (No Response) and users cancelling their authentication ceremony
(User Cancelled). The next leading cause were incorrect passcodes, which includes users who mistype passcodes from SMS, the help desk, a
hardware token, or a backup passcode. “No Keys Pressed” indicates a user or their voicemail answered the phone, but did not send a keypress
to authorize access. “Deny unenrolled user” is an error triggered when someone is forced to start using 2FA, but has not yet set up any second
factors. If users dismiss a Duo Push notiﬁcation, they can choose to mark the event as a “User Mistake” or fraud. Only UCB enabled a feature
to block multiple push notiﬁcations from being sent at once. Blocked duplicate requests failed with the code “Anomalous Push.” “Error” is a
miscellaneous category.
this metric will capture actual user struggle as well as effects
like user distraction. Another source of error could be from
users beginning multiple simultaneous 2FA ceremonies and
succeeding with one before another timed out.
Average recovery times at both organizations were 10–100
seconds. The full distribution is shown in Figure 5. However,
the median recovery time is split between the 10-100 and the
10,000–100,000 seconds range (≈3-28 hours). This means
that individual users’ recovery times are left-skewed. Hours
pass before 40% of users next successfully log in (by their
individual median response times). The worst 20% of user’s
median recovery times indicate that their failed or aborted
logins were not successfully retried until at least the next day.
These recovery delays may indicate a productivity cost if
important tasks are postponed or forgotten. As one user wrote
in a support ticket:
“Today around 2:20pm I attempted to log into the
wiki. I selected Duo Push. Nothing appeared on
my phone and after about a minute of sitting and
waiting, I got this response: Login timed out. . . I
pushed Send Me a Push again and got this message:
Shibboleth has encountered an error. . . After that, I
started over and everything worked that time. (But
I have forgotten why I was going to the wiki.)”
(HELPDESK-2003)
4.5 Problems Causing Support Tickets
Some problems arising from 2FA were concerning enough
that users created tickets with the engineering help desk
either online, by email, or by phone. Because previous work
has already established the existence of usability problems
using rigorous qualitative methods, our goal was mostly to
learn which problems were severe enough to be escalated
to the level of needing technical support. We conducted a
qualitative analysis on support tickets supplied by UIUC
using the grounded theory approach. We iteratively performed
open coding on a random subset of 6,721 tickets to design a
codebook containing 13 codes. The subset was of size 200
and a different subset was drawn at each iteration to avoid
sampling bias. Using the resulting codebook, we applied the
codes to another random drawn subset of 500 tickets. The
results of this process are shown in Table 3. Two researchers
independently coded the dataset before resolving any conﬂicts,
yielding a Kupper-Hafner agreement score of .79 (“substantial
agreement”) [18]. We chose the Kupper-Hafner statistic
over Cohen’s kappa because our codes were not mutually
exclusive, a fundamental assumption for Cohen’s kappa [6].
The disagreements were resolved by consensus among the
coders before ﬁnal reporting.
4.5.1 Enrollment and setup issues
The highest proportion of all support tickets are related to
2FA enrollment and setup issues (34.40%±5.48%). These
tickets indicate that many users were confused about the
nature of 2FA and unable to identify it as a source of error
when performing their ordinary tasks. Therefore, a lot of
support effort was aimed at explaining what 2FA is and how
to initially set it up. As an example, one user said:
“I am having trouble getting into my school email.
I keep getting this message: “Access Denied. The

Table 3: Codebook for 2FA Support Tickets from UIUC Part 1—500 support tickets were coded by two independent researchers. We present
the estimated prevalence of these issues across all 6,721 support tickets alongside a 99% conﬁdence interval for proportions. Codes were
not all mutually exclusive. We report an extrapolation to the presence of these themes in the full population of tickets with a proportional
conﬁdence interval calculated at a .99 conﬁdence level. Overall our agreement was signiﬁcant to strong with Kupper-Hafner’s interrater
agreement for non-mutually-exclusive coding (0.79—indicating substantial agreement).

Certain categories of users were particularly disadvantaged,
as they had to be physically on campus in order to enroll in
2FA. The support staff provided an enrollment link to users
off-campus, however several users struggled to ﬁnd the email:
“I’m an off campus student, and the email that I
received a few weeks ago [PII] that I would be
receiving a [PII] for [PII] 2FA registration. I never
got that link. Can this be sent to me?” (SEC-356)
Others did not know there would be such an email and were
concerned that they might have to physically travel to campus
to enroll in 2FA:
“I keep getting [PII] asking me to update my
password to 2FA. When I attempt to do so, I
get a message that I must be connected to the
[BLINDED] network to process it. Today I got an
[PII] saying that if I don’t update by [BLINDED],
my account will be shut off. What am I supposed
to do? I have to travel to [BLINDED] to change my
password?” (HELPDESK-1998)
Some users also required additional assistance setting up
their second factors, including the Duo Mobile app, phones,
and hardware tokens. Although most of these issues were
resolved easily, other problems were more involved:
“Helped client enroll in 2FA with a non-smartphone.
I ﬁrst set it up as a landline/basic phone but that
option does not allow texts, so I ended up adding
my own phone number (which I removed later),
removing his number, then adding his number again
as a smartphone so that he could use both the call
and text options.” (HELPDESK-2698)
These tickets demonstrate that a lot of assistance from
the support staff is required during the pre-enrollment and
initial enrollment stages. Furthermore, providing adequate
online resources to users that facilitate the process of 2FA
enrollment would likely lead to a reduction in the number of
issues experienced by the users.
4.5.2 Updates and recovery issues
Another major source of issues arose when existing users
of 2FA had to register a new device or update their phone
number (13.80%±3.98%). In many cases, users were locked
out of their accounts as they did not have access to their
previous device to use the Duo Mobile app or to their old
phone numbers to receive a text or a call. In these instances,
users had to reach to support staff to obtain a bypass code,
which allowed them to access their 2FA settings. For instance,
a member of the support team described one such problem:
“This person has a new phone number to
authenticate with for 2FA. I had TL [PII] send
them a bypass token and gave them instructions
for updating their account’s phone number.”
(HELPDESK-2207)
An additional problem occurred when users had no
secondary non-university email registered with their account
to receive the bypass codes (8.20%±3.17%). In this case, the
support staff also had to verify the claimed identity of the
users, which was not always possible. Moreover, it resulted
in an additional burden on the staff, as users had to follow up
at a later time in order to obtain the bypass code:
USENIX Association
29th USENIX Security Symposium    135
“User called and said he had a new phone number
so he needed a bypass to change it in [BLINDED]. I
tried to generate a code for him but the bank account
did not match so he said he would ﬁnd it and call
back.” (HELPDESK-2459)
Sometimes, the users themselves were reluctant to share
the information required to verify their identity. For example:
informed the customer of the things we
“I
needed in order to send a veriﬁcation code, but
she was not comfortable sharing the last four
of her bank account number so she hung up.”
(HELPDESK-4911)
These support
tickets indicate that users should be
prompted to provide a secondary communication channel
(e.g., non-organizational email) during enrollment to facilitate
assistance when they are locked out of their accounts. It is also
important that organizations have a mechanism for identity
veriﬁcation that users deem acceptable and non-intrusive.
4.5.3 Second factors and availability issues
When it comes to second factors chosen by users, 51 support
tickets are focused on issues with telephony, i.e. calls and
SMS (10.20%±3.49%), 26 are related to the Duo Mobile
app (5.20%±2.56%), and 18 are centered on the hardware
token (3.60%±2.15%). In 23 support tickets users mentioned
problems with their device (4.60%±2.42%), and it was not
clear from the context whether the Duo Mobile app or
telephony was impacted, such as in this user support request:
“I need to log on ASAP but I don’t have access to
my phone. There appears to be no option to bypass
or send a temporary [PII] to my email address.”
(HELPDESK-5710)
The context of these tickets varies, depending on whether
the issue occurs during the enrollment or the usage of 2FA.
Although some tickets do not list any speciﬁc problem, device
availability is a major theme that emerged from the support
tickets (8.40%±3.20%). While all second factors could be
affected by a lack of availability, most users experienced
problems when they left their device at home or could not
receive a call or a text (due to lack of cellular service,
international travel, etc.). These problems were aggravated
when users were unable to prove their identity to the support
staff in order to obtain a bypass code, such as in this case:
“Client wanted to login to 2FA, but the “call me”
was registered with his home phone, and he was not
at home. I told him we could send a bypass if he
provided the last 4 digits of his back[sic] account
set up with university direct deposit, but he did not
know it. After a minute of searching, he hung up,
seemingly upset.” (HELPDESK-2220)
Sometimes users were confused about the requirement
of an Internet connection to use 2FA. Although the Duo
Mobile App requires an Internet connection to receive a
push authentication request, it can also be used to obtain
a time-based one-time password (TOTP), which does not
require an Internet connection or mobile service. Nevertheless,
some users were possibly unaware of this functionality:
“[PII] a PhD studying and is traveling abroad. [PII]
having trouble login to the system since my phone
number is not available.” (HELPDESK-752)

topics
including assistance setting up a new type
(3.20%±2.03%), un-enrollment

requests (2.00%±1.62%), and feedback (3.20%±2.03%).
We applied the code ‘feedback’ to tickets that include feature
requests, policy complaints, and negative opinions, as all
three aspects came together most of the time:
“2FA is important for critical/sensitive systems and
when accessing systems from off campus, but to
implement it across the board for all systems is too
much. It’s too invasive and starts interfering with
productivity. Sometimes the cure in fact IS worse
than the disease.” (SEC-41)
“Why can’t
it be more similar to banking
authentication? [PII] have to do the [PII] new
device/browser combination and after that it never
requires a second factor authentication.
[PII]
eliminates the nuisance and frustration of having
to go through a many stepped process just
to download homework assignments and watch
lectures.” (SEC-52)
Moreover, although tickets that expressed positive opinion
appeared during our open coding, none of the 500 tickets
that we randomly selected for subsequent coding conveyed
support for the implemented 2FA system. An example of
a support ticket we encountered during open coding that
expresses positive opinion is:
“I appreciate the fact that 2FA is mandatory. [PII] is
a very important tech and I use it wherever possible.”
(HELPDESK-5665)
4.5.5 Comparison to Related Work
Colnago et al. reported help desk ticket classiﬁcation statistics
provided by CMU’s technical support staff [7]. While 2FA
help desk tickets were normally less than 5% of their help
desk’s workload, they swelled to 25% during the mandatory
2FA adoption period. They did not have access to the ticket
text, and thus limited their analysis to the categorization done
