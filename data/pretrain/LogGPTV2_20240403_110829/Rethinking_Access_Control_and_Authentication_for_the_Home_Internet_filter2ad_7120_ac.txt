A) Babysitter vs. Visiting Family
In the pre-study, we identiﬁed the babysitter and a visit-
ing family member to be members of a guest-like group.
In the main study, participants’ overall attitudes toward
babysitters and visiting family members were quite con-
sistent with each other. No signiﬁcant differences are ob-
served between these two relationships in our pairwise
chi-squared tests. This is understandable because both

Figure 2: Participants’ desired access-control policies. We introduced participants to a list of relationships (e.g., neigh-
bor) and asked them to choose whether someone of that relationship should be permitted to “always,” “sometimes,”
or “never” control a capability (e.g., adjust the camera angle) in their smart home.
relationships share some trust with the homeowner, while
neither lives in the same household.
In general, policies toward a visiting family member are
slightly more permissive than policies toward a babysit-
ter. However, analyzing the qualitative data, we found
the situation to be more complex. There are some spe-
ciﬁc capabilities, such as “Live Video,” where babysit-
ters would be granted permissions at a higher rate than a
visiting family member. 57.1 % of participants decided
that a visiting family member would never have access
to this feature, while only 33.3 % of participants decided
the same for a babysitter. The reason is that a babysit-
ter’s job is to take care of a child while a parental ﬁg-
ure is away. Therefore, the capability itself might help a
babysitter take better care of the child, leading to a high
rate of granting this permission sometimes.
Meanwhile, some features show strong subjective vari-
ations, including granting babysitters and visiting fam-
ily members permission for “Answering the Doorbell.”
Some participants found it useful to always allow access,
while other participants felt uncomfortable letting some-
one that is not part of their family have access to this
particular capability.
From these observations, we conclude that it is important
to have both a relationship-based and capability-based
access-control model in a smart home. Such a model
should be ﬂexible enough to address the complex needs
and use cases that might occur.
B) Child vs. Teenager
Though both children and teenagers are under a parent
or guardian’s watch, a teenager (presented as 16 years
old) and a child (presented as 8 years old) were given
very different access scopes. After removing the ﬁve ca-
pabilities that are not applicable to a child (whom we as-
sume lacks a smartphone), for twelve of the seventeen re-
maining capabilities teenagers were given greater access
(FET, all p < .05). A 16-year-old teenager was regarded
as a young adult by many participants and was more
widely trusted to use capabilities responsibly. Therefore,
the always permission was chosen often, and no need for
supervision was mentioned in their free-text responses.
Meanwhile, granting an 8-year-old child unencumbered
access worried participants much more. Some partici-
pants mentioned that they were concerned that a young
child would misuse these capabilities, either intention-
ally or unintentionally, and thus ruin all the settings.
Several participants even expressed their worries that a
young child could get themselves in danger with the ac-
cess. For instance, one participant, who selected never
for the capability of seeing which door is currently
locked or unlocked, wrote: “An elementary school child
should not be leaving the house on his own accord.” An
8-year-old child’s level of understanding of a smart home
system is also questionable. As a result, children rarely
were granted access always for capabilities other than
those related to lights.

tively restrictive settings for both teenagers and young
children (e. g., “Order Online”), attitudes differed.
Though only 5.3 % of participants agreed to give full ac-
cess to “Order Online” to a teenager, 73.7 % chose some-
times over never, giving limited access to their teenager
to buy things they needed on Amazon. For young chil-
dren, 94.7 % participants believed that a child at that age
should never have access to it, frequently justifying that
there is no need for younger children to order things on-
line themselves. Many participants mentioned supervi-
sion or limitations on what a teenager can buy on Ama-
zon, but they did admit they would let a teenager buy
things from Amazon themselves if they had a reason.
C) Overall Preference for Restrictive Polices
We found that, except for spouses and teenagers, most
participants preferred a more restrictive access-control
policy over a more permissive one. For nine of the
twenty-two capabilities averaged over all relationships,
more than half of participants chose never more fre-
quently than sometimes, and sometimes more frequently
than always. Averaged across all capabilities, only
18.1 % of participants (σ = 0.12, median = 13.2%)
chose always for visiting family members, 10.3 % for
babysitters (σ = 0.09, median = 7.9%), 8.3 % for chil-
dren (σ = 0.10, median = 5.6%) and 0.7 % for neigh-
bors (σ = 0.03, median = 0%). There was only a small
group of capabilities for which participants were widely
permissive: controlling lights and music, which do not
have much potential to cause harm or damage.
6.4 Default Policies (RQ2)
In this section, we give an overview of the default
deny/allow access policies we observed that capture most
participants’ responses. We categorize the policies by re-
lationships and give an in-depth analysis of our ﬁndings.
6.4.1 Default Allow
A) Spouses are Highly Trusted
Averaged across all capabilities, 93.5 % of participants
(σ = 0.09, median = 95.3%) agreed to always give
access to their spouse, while only 4.15 % (σ = 0.05,
median = 0%) answered sometimes, and 2.35 % (σ =
0.06, median = 0%) said never. For participants who
selected always, their most frequent reason was that they
fully trust their spouse and that equality should be guar-
anteed in a marriage. Half of the non-permissive re-
sponses came from the capability to delete the smart
lock’s log ﬁle.
B) Controlling Lights
Access-control policies relating to lights were the most
permissive. Looking at the responses for the capability
Anyone who is currently at home should always be allowed
to adjust lighting
No one should be allowed to delete log ﬁles

ﬂected the vast majority of participants’ preferences.

to turn lights on and off, most responses align with a pro-
posed default policy of people only being able to control
the lights if they are physically present within the home.
Relatedly, some participants chose sometimes for visiting
family members and babysitters, depending on whether
they are physically present within the home.
6.4.2 Default Deny
A) Lock Log Sensitivity
As mentioned in Section 6.2, “Delete Lock Log” is the
capability least frequently permitted, and access should
therefore be denied by default. Even for a spouse, this ca-
pability should not be accessed by default (only 68.4 %
chose always for their spouse). More than 75 % of par-
ticipants chose never for all other relationships. As the
main method of retrospecting usage history, the log is not
meant to be deleted.
B) Supervising Children
The elementary-school-age child (presented as 8 years
old) was one of the most restricted relationships. On
average across all capabilities, 69.4 % of participants
chose never for the child (σ = 0.19, median = 70.6%).
Only neighbors received fewer permissions. In our chi-
squared tests, we did not observe signiﬁcant differences
in desired access-control settings for children between
participants who are currently living with a child, who
have lived with a child before, and who have never lived
with a child. None of our capabilities were considered
child-friendly enough for even the majority of partici-
pants to always grant their elementary-school-age child
262    27th USENIX Security Symposium

access to that capability always. For only the “Light
State” and “Play Music” capabilities was never chosen
by fewer than half of participants. Despite being an im-
mediate family member and living together, plenty of
participants expressed fears that a child at that age might
toy with these features and unintentionally mess up their
settings or even cause danger to themselves. With su-
pervision, though, many participants would consider giv-
ing temporary access to their children to gradually teach
them how to use such a new technology.
C) Ordering Online
The capability to make an online purchase was gener-
ally limited to spouses only; 78.9 % of participants said
that only their spouse should always be allowed to make
online purchases, but 84.2 % also said that it was accept-
able for non-spouse users to do the same if given explicit
permission by the homeowner.
D) Administrative Capabilities
By default, only spouses should be able to access ad-
ministrative capabilities, such as adding users, connect-
ing new devices, and installing software updates. 89.7 %
of participants gave their spouse access to these admin-
istrative capabilities always, while only 39.7 % of par-
ticipants always gave comparable access to their teenage
child. Unsurprisingly, under twenty percent of partici-
pants would give full access to other relationships.
6.5 The Impact of Context (RQ3)
Since there are many factors at play in the access-control-
policy speciﬁcation process, it is important to identify
which contextual factors are most inﬂuential in this pro-
cess and how they contribute to the ﬁnal decision. The
full results are visualized in Figure 3. We also ran chi-
squared tests to see if each contextual factor had a rela-
tively greater inﬂuence on some capabilities rather than
others. While we did not observe signiﬁcant differences
for the “People Nearby”, “Cost” and “Usage History”
contextual factors across capabilities, we did observe sig-
niﬁcant differences for the other ﬁve contextual factors.
A) Age
The age of the user was the most inﬂuential factor on
average across the eight capabilities (78.1 % on average,
σ = 0.13, median = 78.3%), and the proportion of par-
ticipants for whom age mattered varied across capabil-
ities (p = 0.040). The main capability for which age
played less of a role was for changing the camera an-
gle (only 50 %). Many participants were concerned with
letting a young person have access to certain capabili-
ties. “They need to be mature enough to use it responsi-
bly” was one typical response. However, another partici-
pant instead explained, “It will be the person themselves
and how capable they are with technology. I do not care
about age.”. Thus, while age was frequently mentioned,
in reality the decision process is more likely to be driven
by how capable and responsible a user is, which some-
times correlates with the user’s age. Our results indi-
cate that a child at a young age (around 8 years old) is
generally not perceived to be tech-savvy and responsible
enough to be allowed unsupervised access.
B) Location of Device
The proportion of participants for whom the device’s lo-
cation impacted the access-control policy varied across
capabilities (p < 0.001). Capabilities relating to cam-
eras were unsurprisingly very location-sensitive. “Cam-
era Angle” is the only capability for which a device’s
location was more frequently inﬂuential (70 % of par-
ticipants) than the user’s age. Device location was the
second most frequently invoked factor for turning a cam-
era on or off (60 %) and watching live video (81 %).
If a smart camera is installed indoors, especially in a
bedroom or bathroom, it will be much more privacy-
sensitive. Participants reﬂected this by saying, for ex-
ample, “I can see where a guest/house-sitter/baby-sitter
might need to access a view of outside or the garage
but not inside.” Therefore, when designing a smart cam-
era, whether the camera will be used indoors or outdoors
should be considered and reﬂected in default access-
control policies.
C) Recent Usage History
The proportion of participants for whom a device’s re-
cent usage history impacted their access-control policy
did not differ signiﬁcantly across capabilities. On aver-
age across capabilities, 51.7 % of participants (σ = 0.12,
median = 52.6%) agreed that this factor impacted their
decision about the access-control policy. For participants
who felt the device’s recent usage history would change
their decision, two main rationales arose. On the one
hand, if the history states that a user is abusing a ca-
pability, then the owner may revoke access. One par-
ticipant wrote, “If someone were to misuse the device,
you best bet they aren’t getting a second chance. Alright
maybe I’ll give them a second chance, but deﬁnitely not a
third!”. On the other hand, if a user turns out to be trust-
worthy, then the owner may consider letting them keep
the access, or even extending it. “If my kid had been us-
ing the device responsibly, I would feel more comfortable
giving them more access.” However, some participants
felt the recent usage history was not particularly relevant
for two main reasons. First, if the involved capability it-
self cannot cause much trouble, such as “Light Scheme,”
a common line of reasoning is that “It would be hard to
abuse this capability, so it doesn’t matter to me.” Second,
if the capability itself is so concerning that participants
are reluctant to give others access (e.g., “Delete Video”),
usage history did not play a role.
