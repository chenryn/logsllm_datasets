Abstract. In the last years, network measurements have shown a grow-
ing interest in active probing techniques. Recent works propose ap-
proaches based on the IP prespeciﬁed timestamp option and consider
its support to be enough for their purposes. On the other hand, other
works found that IP options are usually ﬁltered, poorly implemented, or
not widely supported. In this paper, to shed light on this controversial
topic, we investigate the responsiveness obtained targeting more than
1.7M IPs using several probes (ICMP, UDP, TCP, and SKIP), with
and without the IP prespeciﬁed timestamp option. Our results show
that: (i) the option has a signiﬁcant impact on the responsiveness to the
probes; (ii) a not−negligible amount of targeted addresses return several
categories of non RFC−compliant replies; (iii) by considering only the
RFC−compliant replies which preserve the option, the probes ranking by
responsiveness considerably changes. Finally, we discuss the large−scale
applicability of two proposed techniques based on the IP prespeciﬁed
timestamp option.
Keywords: Internet measurements, Active probing, IP options.

Introduction
The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), after more than three decades and several
minor updates, still represents the core of the Internet and many protocols and
services have been built on top of it. IPv4 has provision for optional header
ﬁelds in order to transport additional information. Particularly, the Timestamp
(TS) optional header (IP option type 68) is deﬁned along with three variants:
(i) each router forwarding the packet, if enough space is available, should add a
timestamp; (ii) a (IP, timestamp) couple should be added; (iii) the sender requires
a timestamp for up to four “prespeciﬁed” IPs [1, 2]. We refer to them as TSo,
TSi, and TSp respectively. Since recent works [3–5] reconsidered the utility of
TSp, in this paper we focus our attention on such variant.
Works proposing applications based on TSp consider its support to be enough
for their purposes [3,4]. On the other hand, previous works stated that IP options
are usually ﬁltered, poorly implemented, or not widely supported [6, 7].
To the best of our knowledge, both claims have not been properly supported by
a large scale analysis comprising a set of destinations statistically signiﬁcative.

Moreover, previous analysis only considered TCPsyn and ICMPecho
request probes,
thus not considering other possibilities to obtain a reply from a targeted desti-
nation.
In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the TSp support in Internet
obtained by targeting more than 1.7M destinations from two vantage points
(VPs). For the sake of completeness, we employ four diﬀerent probes (ICMP,
UDP, TCP and SKIP), with and without the TSp option set. Such analysis allowed
us to evaluate the impact of TSp on the responsiveness to each probe and to
investigate the RFC−compliance of diﬀerent IP stack implementations.
The paper is organized as follows. While in Sec. 2 we discuss the most impor-
tant related works, in Sec. 3 we brieﬂy describe the background and the adopted
methodology. Sec. 4 contains the results of our large−scale measurement cam-
paign. In Sec. 5 we brieﬂy discuss the impact of our ﬁndings on some TSp-based
applications. Finally, Sec. 6 ends the paper with conclusion remarks.
2 Related Work
Gunes et al. [8] conducted an experimental study of both historical and current
responsiveness to probes concluding that the most eﬀective is ICMP, followed
by TCP and UDP. They also found a higher responsiveness of network devices
to indirect probes (i.e. probes launched towards other destinations). Our work
has a diﬀerent goal: while the overall responsiveness is a well investigated topic,
we aim at measuring the impact of the TSp option on the responsiveness to
several probes. Fonseca et al. [7], using Planetlab, estimated the transit ﬁltering
of packets crafted with and without TS and Record Route (RR) options by using
a modiﬁed version of traceroute based on ICMP probes. They demonstrated, over
a 7.5k IPs dataset, that transit ﬁltering is mainly concentrated in a minority of
edge ASes. In [6] Medina et al. covered the impact of TS and RR options on
TCP by analyzing connections towards 500 web servers. Our work extends both
analyses to 1.7M IPs and to probes other than ICMP and TCP, in order to
estimate the overall utility in using TSp probes, taking into account the eﬀect of
transit ﬁltering by using two not−ﬁltered VPs. Sherry et al. [3] proposed a novel
alias resolution approach based on the TSp option as well as a measurement study
of its support. The latter made use of ICMPecho
request probes to target around 267.7k
destinations. Our work extends such study targeting with several probes more
than 1.7M destinations in order to globally estimate the impact and the support
of the TSp option as well as the RFC compliance. Our results and hypothesis
experimentally justify part of the ﬁndings detailed in [3]. Finally, the TSp option
has been recently exploited in the reverse traceroute [4] and to infer router
statistics [5]. We evaluate the applicability on large scale scenario of [3] and [4]
in the light of the obtained results.
3 Background and Methodology
When using TSp, the originating host composes the option data with a maximum
of four (IP, 0) records and sets the pointer ﬁeld for pointing to the ﬁrst record.
A Hands-on Look at Active Probing

For instance, a forwarding router should stamp the pointed record only if it
contains its own IP address. In such case, the pointer should be incremented to
point to the next record. If the router cannot register timestamps due to lack of
space, the overﬂow ﬁeld should be incremented. The timestamp value should be
inserted in a standard format, which represents the elapsed time in milliseconds
since midnight UT. If such format is not respected the high order bit should be
set to one, indicating the use of a non−standard value.
In order to estimate its impact on the responsiveness to the probes, a list of
addresses is queried with a set of probes crafted with and without TSp option.
The list is extracted from a complete Archipelago [9] cycle and ﬁltered to remove
non−publicly routable addresses (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, ...).
We classify each IP from the list as Pathending, if it appears in the Archipelago
dataset exclusively as a traceroute destination, and as Router otherwise. It is
worth to notice that the Router set surely contains IP addresses belonging to
network devices, while an unknown percentage of Pathending IPs consists of end
hosts. Each address is then solicited with the following probes: (a) ICMPecho
request;
port
(b) UDP towards a presumably unused port (15616), to collect an ICMP
unreach
message; (c) TCP towards an unassigned well-known port (737), to solicit a TCP
reset reply; (d) an IP packet carrying a SKIP message (an obsolete protocol), to
proto
unreach message. We chose SKIP after a preliminary test demon-
solicit an ICMP
strated how unassigned protocol numbers obtain much less answers.
In line with [3], we use the TSp option according to the (A|BBBB) format
with A=B (A represents the destination address and BBBB the ordered list
of prespeciﬁed IPs). In the following, we refer to the probes with TSp option
respectively as ICMPp, UDPp, TCPp, and SKIPp. When using ICMPp and TCPp
probes, the returned option (if present) is extracted from the IP layer of the reply
packet, while, regarding UDPp and SKIPp, it is extracted from the original probe
carried back by the ICMP error packet. A retransmission mechanism allows to
deal with potential congestion events and rate limiting policies: before giving up
each probe is sent four times with a timeout of two seconds. During a preliminary
test, we found that some destinations not always stamp the option. We call such
phenomenon timestamp rate limiting. In order to deal with it, we apply the
retransmission mechanism also when the returned option records are empty.
4 Experimental Results
In this section, we present the results obtained with a measurement campaign
conducted between the 16th and 20th of June 2011 from two VPs located in Napoli,
Italy (NA) and Louvain−la−Neuve, Belgium (LLN)1. The collected dataset is
freely available online2. In a preliminary campaign we also employed 10 Planetlab
VPs, which we decided to discard because they do not support the SKIP protocol3
and their access networks often ﬁlter probes with TSp option.

Fig. 1. Responsiveness to the probes per vantage point
After removing non−publicly routable addresses (1.4%), 1, 776, 095 destina-
tions were extracted from the Archipelago’s cycle started on the 13th of June
2011. The obtained IPs resulted to be equally divided into Pathending (49.99%)
and Router (50.01%).
All the results from the two VPs are very similar: for instance, as reported in
Fig.1, the responsiveness to each probe is consistent between them. Therefore,
given such consistency and for space constraints, in the following we discuss the
results of the VP located in Napoli.
About 19% of the destinations were unresponsive to our probes, while a small
portion (2.25%) returned non RFC−compliant replies (we call them anomalies).
Hence, disregarding the anomalies, we ﬁrst quantify the support of TSp and its
impact on the responsiveness to the probes. Then, we deeply investigate and
characterize the isolated non RFC−compliant behaviors.
4.1 Support Analysis
Responsiveness.
In Fig.2(a) the amount of destinations responsive to probes
without option (P ) is compared with the amount of them replying when TSp is
enabled by preserving the option (P T S
opt ) or regardless of this (P T S).
In line with [8], the most eﬀective probe without option is ICMP (78.1%)
followed by TCP (46.1%), UDP (41.4%) and SKIP (34.7%). The insertion of TSp
heavily impacts the responsiveness to each probe (−33% ICMP, −24% UDP, −28%
TCP, −19% SKIP), but preserves the ranking order. However, applications rely-
ing on TSp generally require the reply to preserve the option and the ranking
signiﬁcantly changes when considering only such replies: ICMPp (40.7%), SKIPp

(15.8%), UDPp (15%) and TCPp (3.6%). It is worth to notice how most replies to
TCPp probes were received without option, while this eﬀect is marginal for the
other probes. Moreover, as shown in Fig.2(b), Router IPs resulted more respon-
sive than Pathending ones for all the probes, with the only exception of TCPp.
In the rest of the paper, all the replies not preserving the TSp option will not be
taken into account.
Tab. 1(a) and 1(b) show the relation among diﬀerent probes with respect to
the responsiveness. Each element (i, j) represents the percentage of destinations
responsive to both the probes on the ith row and jth column. The main diagonal,
therefore, points out the amount of destinations which responded to a speciﬁc
probe. Without option, ICMP probes showed a signiﬁcant marginal utility com-
pared to the others. Anyway, even the other probes showed some marginal utility
compared to ICMP: UDP (0.8%), TCP (1.2%) and SKIP (2.1%). When TSp is en-
abled the scenario is similar: while only part of the IPs which replied to ICMPp
also provided replies to the other probes, UDPp and SKIPp collected answers
