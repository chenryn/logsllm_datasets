# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.6.2951.0
    Any other software?
# Steps to reproduce
1 Set the following global settings in profile.json
        "alwaysShowTabs": false,
        "showTabsInTitlebar": false,
2 Start Terminal
  * No tab bar visible
3 _Control-Shift-t_ to create a new tab
  * Here it's PowerShell Core, but reproduces with git-bash for example
  * Tab bar becomes visible here.
  * Switching between tabs here does not affect the outcome.
4 Type `exit` to terminate the currently-visible shell
  * Middle-clicking the active tab also works. Middle-clicking the _other_ tab does not reproduce.
  * If extra shells were opened, this doesn't reproduce, it seems to only happen when the tab bar is hidden as part of closing the current tab.
  * Setting close-on-exit means this doesn't reproduce until the tab is closed, so not related to the shell process terminating.
# Expected behavior
  * Current tab closes
  * Tab bar disappears
  * Other tab is usable.
# Actual behavior
  * Current tab closes
  * Tab bar disappears
  * (!!) Other tab content is visible, but cursor is not flashing and input is not handled
  * (!!) A few seconds later, the application crashes, logged in Event Viewer:

I have raised a Feedback Hub issue, but it has not yet appeared in "My

a few minutes, but now it shows nothing...)
