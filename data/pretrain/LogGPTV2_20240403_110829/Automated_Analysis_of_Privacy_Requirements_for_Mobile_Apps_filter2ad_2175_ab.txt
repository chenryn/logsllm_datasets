In this section we present our automated large-scale ML
analysis of privacy policies. We discuss the law on privacy
notice and choice (§ III-A), our evaluation of how many apps
have a privacy policy (§ III-B), and the analysis of policy
content (§ III-C).
A. Privacy Notice and Choice
The privacy requirements analyzed here are derived from
selected laws and apps’ privacy policies. If a policy or app
does not appear to adhere to a privacy requirement, we deﬁne
a potential privacy requirement inconsistency to occur (which
we also refer to as potential inconsistency or non-compliance).
In this regard, we caution that a potential inconsistency does
not necessarily mean that a law is violated. First, not all privacy

Fig. 1: Per our privacy requirements, apps that process
Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII) need to (1) have a
privacy policy, (2-3) include notices about policy changes and
access, edit, and deletion rights in their policy, (4-6) notify
users of data collection practices, and (7-9) disclose how
data is shared with third parties. The notice requirements for
policy changes and access, edit, and deletion are satisﬁed by
including the notices in the policies while the collection and
sharing practices must be also implemented in the apps. We
consider collection and sharing implemented in an app if it
sends data to a ﬁrst or third party server, respectively. Thus,
it is not enough if data is kept on the phone but never sent.
requirements might be applicable to all apps and policies.
Second, our system is based on a particular interpretation of
the law. While we believe that our interpretation is sound and
in line with the enforcement actions of the FTC and other
regulatory agencies, reasonable minds may differ.4 Third, our
system is based on machine learning and static analysis and,
thus, by its very nature errors can occur. Figure 1 provides
an overview of the law on notice and choice and the nine
privacy requirements that our system analyzes (Privacy Policy
Requirement, NPC, NAED, CID, CL, CC, SID, SL, SC).
As to the privacy policy requirement, there is no generally
applicable federal statute demanding privacy policies for apps.
However, California and Delaware enacted comprehensive
online privacy legislation that effectively serves as a national
minimum privacy threshold given that app publishers usually
do not provide state-speciﬁc app versions or exclude California
or Delaware residents. In this regard, the California Online
Privacy Protection Act of 2003 (CalOPPA) requires online
services that collect PII to post a policy.5 The same is true
according to Delaware’s Online Privacy and Protection Act
(DOPPA).6 In addition, the FTC’s Fair Information Practice
Principles (FTC FIPPs) call for consumers to be given notice
of an entity’s information practices before any PII is col-
lected [27]. Further, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection

Act of 1998 (COPPA) makes policies mandatory for apps
directed to or known to be used by children.7 Thus, we treat
the existence of a privacy policy as a privacy requirement.
CalOPPA and DOPPA demand that privacy policies de-
scribe the process by which users are notiﬁed of policy
changes.8 COPPA also requires description of access, edit, and
deletion rights.9 Under the FTC FIPPs [27] as well as CalOPPA
and DOPPA those rights are optional.10 We concentrate our
analysis on a subset of data types that are, depending on
the context, legally protected: device IDs, location data, and
contact information. App publishers are required to disclose
the collection of device IDs (even when hashed) and location
data.11 Device IDs and location data are also covered by
CalOPPA12 and for childrens’ apps according to COPPA.13
The sharing of these types of information with third parties
requires consent as well.14 Our deﬁnition of sharing covers the
direct data collection by third parties from ﬁrst party apps.15
Beyond device IDs and location data, contact information, such
as e-mail addresses, may be protected, too.16
It should be noted that we interpret ad identiﬁers to be PII
since they can be used to track users over time and across
devices. We are also assuming that a user did not opt out
of ads (because otherwise no ad identiﬁers would be sent to
opted out ad networks). We further interpret location data to
particularly cover GPS, cell tower, and Wi-Fi locations. We
assume applicability of the discussed laws and perform our
analysis based on the guidance provided by the FTC and
the California Ofﬁce of the Attorney General (Cal AG) in
enforcement actions and recommendations for best practices
(e.g., [27] and [11]). Speciﬁcally, we interpret the FTC actions
as disallowing the omission of data practices in policies and
assume that silence on a practice means that it does not occur.17
Finally, we assume that all apps in the US Play store are
subject to CalOPPA and DOPPA.18 We believe this assumption
is reasonable as we are not aware of any US app publisher
excluding California or Delaware residents from app use or
providing state-speciﬁc app versions.
B. Privacy Policy Requirement
To assess whether apps fulﬁll the requirement of having
a privacy policy we crawled the Google Play store and
downloaded a sample (n = 17, 991) of free apps (full app
set).19 We started our crawl with the most popular apps and
followed random links on their Play store pages to other apps.
We included all categories in our crawl, however, excluded

level based on a two-tailed binomial test).20 Thus, accounting
for an additional 17% (1,478/8,696) of apps having a policy
elsewhere leaves us with 100% − 12% − 17% = 71% out
of n = 8, 696 apps to be potentially non-compliant with the
policy requirement.
Predicting Potential Privacy Policy Requirement Inconsis-
tencies. As it appears that apps with frequent updates typically
have a policy, we evaluate this hypothesis on our full app set
using Pearson’s Chi square test of independence. Speciﬁcally,
it is our null hypothesis that whether an app has a policy is
independent from the year when it was most recently updated.
As the test returns p ≤ 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis
at the 95% conﬁdence level. Indeed, as shown in the linear
regression model of Figure 3 (top), apps with recent update
years have more often a policy than those that were updated
longer ago. In addition to an app’s update year there are
other viable predictors. As shown in the polynomial regression
model of Figure 3 (bottom) the number of installs is insightful.
Apps with high install rates have more often a policy than apps
with average install rates (p ≤ 0.05). Surprisingly, the same
is also true for apps with low install rates. An explanation
could be that those are more recent apps that did not yet
gain popularity. Indeed, apps with low install rates are on
average more recently updated than apps with medium rates.
For example, apps with 500 to 1K installs were on average
updated on March 15, 2015 while apps with 50K to 100K
installs have an average update date as of January 23, 2015.
Further, apps with an Editors’ Choice or Top Developer
badge usually have a policy, which is also true for apps that
offer in-app purchases. It is further encouraging that apps with
a content rating for younger audiences often have a policy.

interval at the 95% level.

Fig. 2: We analyze 17,991 free apps, of which 9,295 (52%)
link to their privacy policy from the Play store (left). Out of
the remaining apps, 6,198 (71%) appear to lack a policy while

that would require them to have one (right).
requires apps in this program to have a policy) and Android
Wear (as we want
to focus on mobile apps). We assume
that our sample is representative in terms of app categories,
which we conﬁrmed with a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
goodness of ﬁt test (two-tailed) against a sample of a million
apps [49]. We could not reject the null hypothesis that both
were drawn from the same distribution (i.e., p > 0.05).
However, while the Play store hosts a long tail of apps that
have fewer than 1K installs (56%) [49], we focus on more
popular apps as our sample includes only 3% of such apps.
Potential Privacy Policy Requirement Inconsistencies. Out
of all policies in the full app set we found that n = 9, 295
apps provided a link to their policy from the Play store (full
policy set) and n = 8, 696 apps lacked such. As shown in
Figure 2, our results suggest that 71% (6,198/8,696) apps
without a policy link are indeed not adhering to the policy
requirement. We used the Play store privacy policy links as
proxies for actual policies, which we ﬁnd reasonable since
regulators requested app publishers to post such links [30],
[11] and app store owners obligated themselves to provide the
necessary functionality [10]. The apps in the full app set were
offered by a total of 10,989 publishers, and their app store
pages linked to 6,479 unique privacy policies.
We arrive at 71% after making two adjustments. First,
if an app does not have a policy it is not necessarily non-
compliant with the policy requirement. After all, apps that are
not processing PII are not obligated to have a policy. Indeed,
we found that 12% (1,020/8,696) of apps without a policy link
are not processing PII and, thus, accounted for those apps.
Second, despite the regulators’ requests to post policy links
in the Play store, some app publishers may still decide to
post their policy elsewhere (e.g., inside their app). To account
for that possibility we randomly selected 40 apps from our
full app set that did not have a policy link in the Play store
but processed PII. We found that 83% (33/40) do not seem
to have a policy posted anywhere (with a Clopper-Pearson
conﬁdence interval (CI) ranging from 67% to 93% at the 95%
