As a seasoned Windows programmer with extensive experience in VC++, I have recently taken on the development of several web-based applications. These projects have involved using Python (with the Pylons framework) and Ruby on Rails, all hosted on Ubuntu Linux.

The release procedures and checklists that we traditionally used for building and deploying VC++ Windows applications are no longer applicable when working with script-based languages. In these cases, we do not build binaries; instead, we copy ASP/PHP files directly into the IIS folder via FTP when using open-source CMS applications. However, this method has become cumbersome, and we now prefer to use SVN (Subversion) for managing our code. We simply perform an `svn checkout` to get the initial version and then use `svn update` to keep the server up-to-date with the latest changes.

### Questions:
1. **Is using `svn checkout` and `svn update` the right method to deploy the latest build files to the server?**
2. **Are there any downsides to using `svn update` for deployment?**
3. **Are there better methods to release script/web-based applications to the production server?**

### Additional Context:
- I have some experience with SSH on the Linux platform.
- I am considering creating a branch in SVN for each release of the web application. Once the release is ready, I would check it out on the server and either set it to run or move it to replace the old version.

### Recommendations:

1. **Using `svn checkout` and `svn update`:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Simple and straightforward.
     - Ensures that the server always has the latest version of the code.
   - **Cons:**
     - Can lead to inconsistent states if the update is interrupted or if the server is under heavy load.
     - No rollback mechanism if the new version introduces issues.

2. **Downsides of `svn update`:**
   - **Inconsistent States:** If the update is interrupted, the server may end up in an inconsistent state.
   - **No Rollback Mechanism:** If the new version has bugs, you need to manually revert to the previous version.
   - **Performance Impact:** Frequent updates can impact server performance, especially during high-traffic periods.

3. **Better Methods for Deployment:**
   - **Branching and Tagging:**
     - Create a branch for each release in SVN.
     - When the release is ready, tag it and check out the tagged version on the server.
     - This method provides a clear history of releases and allows for easy rollbacks.
   - **Automated Deployment Scripts:**
     - Use scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Ansible, or Capistrano) to automate the deployment process.
     - These scripts can handle tasks like stopping the server, updating the code, running migrations, and restarting the server.
   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
     - Implement CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
     - These tools can automatically build, test, and deploy your code to the production server.
   - **Environment Isolation:**
     - Use separate environments (development, staging, production) to test changes before they go live.
     - This helps catch issues early and reduces the risk of downtime.

### Conclusion:
While `svn checkout` and `svn update` are simple and effective for small projects, they may not be the best approach for larger, more complex deployments. Consider using branching and tagging, automated deployment scripts, and CI/CD tools to ensure a more robust and reliable deployment process. Additionally, leveraging SSH for secure and efficient file transfers can further enhance your deployment strategy.
