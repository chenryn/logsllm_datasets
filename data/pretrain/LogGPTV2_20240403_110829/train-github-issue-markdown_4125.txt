Upon cloning the repository and running `all.bash` for installation, I encountered a failure during the test phase. All of my personal programs (used for testing and experimentation) function correctly; it is only this specific test that fails.

### Error Details

The installation test phase fails with the following output:

```sh
6g -o _gotest_.6 client.go fs.go request.go server.go status.go url.go client_test.go request_test.go url_test.go
rm -f _test/http.a
gopack grc _test/http.a _gotest_.6 
make[2]: Leaving directory `/opt/go/src/pkg/http'
--- FAIL: http.TestRedirect

### Summary

The `http.TestRedirect` test fails due to a DNS lookup issue, specifically when trying to resolve `codesearch.google.com`. The DNS server at `192.168.0.1:53` does not return an answer, causing the test to fail. Other tests and programs run without issues.
