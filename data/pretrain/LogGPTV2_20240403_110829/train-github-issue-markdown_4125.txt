    A Fresh clone of the repo leads to this during install with 'all.bash'
    All my programs (for testing and playing around) works fine.
    Its just this test that fail.
    Install test-phase fails with this output:
    6g -o _gotest_.6 client.go fs.go request.go server.go status.go url.go   
    client_test.go request_test.go url_test.go
    rm -f _test/http.a
    gopack grc _test/http.a _gotest_.6
