## Context
Thanks for making this library  Render the selected value. You can only use it when the native property is
> false (default).
I just wanted to ask if it's planned to add this feature for native
selectboxes as well? To be more precise:  
I want to have EVERY feature of `material-ui-next` but when I open the select
box on mobile a "real" select should open. I found other libraries having this
included. They build a `` with `` like you do already, but when you
click on the ` a `` is triggered, so you can use both the
features of the plugin AND the native select box.
Is this something you would do, or maybe something a contributor could do or
would you reject both the idea and a PR? I'm not so fluent in JS, so not 100%
sure if I can fix this problem without making huge BC breaks, but I wanted to
know if there are any plans on doing so?
Reason is, we have a country selection where we display the country flag when
a country has been selected and only display the country names when the select
box is open and we wanted to use the same approach for mobile.
