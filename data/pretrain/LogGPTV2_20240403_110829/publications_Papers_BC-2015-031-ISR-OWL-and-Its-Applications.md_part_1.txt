### Introduction

The World Wide Web (WWW) was initially composed primarily of documents written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), a language designed for visual presentation. HTML uses a set of markup symbols to format web pages for display in web browsers. Over time, the separation of content from presentation style became more pronounced, with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) being used to specify the visual aspects of web pages. Despite these advancements, most web content remains designed for human consumption, making it difficult for computers to interpret and understand the inherent meaning of web pages.

### The Semantic Web

To address this limitation, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) introduced the concept of the Semantic Web (SW). The goal of the SW is to develop technologies and standards that enable computers to understand and process the meaning of web information. The architecture of the Semantic Web, as illustrated in Figure 1, is built on several foundational layers:

1. **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: A formatted string that uniquely identifies abstract or physical resources. For example, `http://eden.dei.uc.pt/~jcardoso/` identifies a web page, while `urn:isbn:3-540-24328-3` identifies a book using its ISBN.
2. **Unicode**: Provides a unique number for every character, ensuring consistency across different platforms, programs, and languages.

### Syntactic Interoperability

Above the URI and Unicode layers, the SW architecture includes the syntactic interoperability layer, which is based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language). XML provides a structured way to represent data, which underlies RDF (Resource Description Framework) and RDFS (RDF Schema). These technologies are essential for OWL, as one of the main syntaxes of OWL is in XML format, and OWL is conceptually an extension of RDF and RDFS.

### Web Ontology Language (OWL)

One of the cornerstones of the Semantic Web is the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is designed to be used by applications that need to understand and reason about the meaning of information, rather than simply parsing data for display purposes. The aim of this chapter is to introduce OWL, which can be used to develop Semantic Web applications that can interpret and use information and data on the web.

#### Key Features of OWL:
- **Proposed by the W3C**: OWL was developed by the W3C to facilitate the publication, sharing, and automation of data understood by computers using ontologies.
- **Logic and Semantics**: To fully comprehend OWL, it is necessary to study its origins, its logical foundations, and the basic components of the language.
- **Layered Architecture**: The SW architecture includes additional layers such as logic, proof, and trust. The top layer, trust, has not been extensively explored yet, but some layers rely on digital signatures to ensure security.

### Conclusion

To effectively utilize OWL, it is essential to first understand the foundational layers of the Semantic Web, including XML, RDF, and RDFS. This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of OWL, its origins, and its key features, enabling readers to develop and deploy Semantic Web applications that can interpret and use web information.
