User: I am running python 2.7.1.  I can't figure out how to launch the IDLE IDE.  I am told it comes already installed with python, but I can't find it using spotlight.
Assistant: After you launch idle from the command line (make sure idle shell window has focus), click File, click "New File". A new window opens; this is your editor.
Type your program in the editor. Click "File", click "Save As...". Save your file somewhere with any name you choose, and a ".py" extension to the file name. 
Click "Run", click "Run Module" (or, F5). Assuming no errors, the results will appear in the Shell window. Edit your file & repeat as necessary.
