**Launching and Using IDLE with Python 2.7.1**

If you are using Python 2.7.1 and having trouble launching the IDLE Integrated Development Environment (IDE), follow these steps to get started:

1. **Launch IDLE from the Command Line:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `idle` and press Enter. This should launch the IDLE shell window.

2. **Create a New File:**
   - Once the IDLE shell window is open, click on `File` in the menu bar.
   - Select `New File` from the dropdown menu. This will open a new editor window where you can write your Python code.

3. **Write and Save Your Program:**
   - In the new editor window, type your Python program.
   - To save your file, click on `File` in the menu bar, then select `Save As...`.
   - Choose a location to save your file, give it a name, and ensure that the file extension is `.py` (e.g., `my_program.py`).

4. **Run Your Program:**
   - To run your program, click on `Run` in the menu bar.
   - Select `Run Module` (or press F5).
   - If there are no errors, the results will be displayed in the IDLE shell window.

5. **Edit and Re-run:**
   - You can edit your code in the editor window and re-run it as needed by repeating the steps above.

If you still cannot find IDLE using Spotlight, ensure that Python and its associated tools are correctly installed. You may also want to check if IDLE is located in the `bin` directory of your Python installation.
