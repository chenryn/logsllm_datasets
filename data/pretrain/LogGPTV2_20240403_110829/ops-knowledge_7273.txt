User: Encounter an error "RequestTooLargeError: The request to API call datastore_v3.Put() was too large.". 
After looking through the code, it happens on the place where it is using task queue.
So how can I split a large queue task into several smaller ones?
Assistant: Check the size of the payload (arguments) you are sending to the task queue. 
If it's more than a few KB in size you need to store it in the datastore and send the key of the object holding the data to the task queue
