ABSTRACT
We propose an eﬃcient additive homomorphic encryption
scheme. In our scheme, an encryption of a message is simply
its noisy modular reduction by several diﬀerent moduli. The
security of our scheme relies on the hardness of a new prob-
lem, the co-Approximate Common Divisor problem. We an-
alyze its hardness by applying all known attacks and devis-
ing dedicated attacks. These analyses are not complete, but
give suﬃciently plausible evidence for the hardness of this
new problem.
Our scheme has an advantage in the performance since
both of encryption and decryption consist of only several
modular multiplications where a modulus is a hard-to-factor
integer N or its prime factor, whereas the previous require
more expensive modular exponentiations. In fact, our rudi-
mentary implementation demonstrates that our public-key
encryption scheme requires about 0.72 ms, 4.00 µs and 0.40 µs
for encryption, decryption and an addition of ciphertexts,
respectively.
It also takes about 40 µs to compute an en-
cryption of the mean of 1000 integers of 128-bit from their
ciphertexts. To the best of our knowledge, our encryption
scheme is the most eﬃcient of those that support an additive
homomorphic property.
As an application of additive homomorphic encryption,
we present how to eﬃciently evaluate a symmetric polyno-
mial by additionally providing ciphertexts of some powers of
messages. We also present a threshold version of our encryp-
tion scheme for smooth adoption of our scheme to advanced
applications such as private set operations.

INTRODUCTION
Additive homomorphic encryption has numerous applica-
tions. It is a fundamental tool to design cryptographic pro-
tocols, such as oblivious pseudorandom functions [30], obliv-
ious transfers [30], private information retrieval [40], and se-
cure 2-party computations including private set intersection
protocols [22, 30].
Its threshold version is also an impor-
tant primitive to construct various cryptographic protocols
including secure multi-party computations [16, 19, 22, 33,
31], electronic voting [17], and commitment schemes [18], to
name a few.
1.1 Our Results
In this paper, we provide a new additive homomorphic
encryption scheme based on noisy modular reduction and its
threshold version. Our proposed scheme has two advantages:
• Both of encryption and decryption consist of simple
operations, such as modular/integer additions and only
several modular multiplications and so take only quad-
ratic time (or quasilinear time using the FFT) in the
size of modulus, where a modulus is a hard-to-factor
integer N or its prime factor.
• The message space is ZQ for any positive integer Q.
Hence it can be a prime ﬁeld as well as a ring with a
hard-to-factor order as in Paillier scheme.
Our scheme has an advantage in the performance due to
the simplicity of operations in encryptions/decryptions. Our
implementation takes about 0.72 ms, 4.00 µs, and 0.40 µs
for encryption, decryption, and addition of our public-key
encryption, respectively.
It shows that our scheme is the
most eﬃcient of those that support an additive homomor-
phic property.
The type of the message space is important in some appli-
cations. For instance, we can eﬃciently and uniquely deter-
mine roots of a polynomial over the message space when it is
a ﬁeld. In particular, ﬁnding a root of a polynomial deﬁned
over ZN is equivalent to factoring N [44] and so there is no
polynomial-time root-ﬁnding algorithm for polynomials over
the message space of Paillier encryption without the factor-
ization of N . Hence, many polynomial representation based
private set operation protocols require additional expensive
costs to extract roots of polynomials [33, 23, 43].
287Note that our scheme supports a limited number of ad-
ditions, but it is allowed to add exponentially many cipher-
texts in the security parameter. Our scheme also supports a
limited number of scalar multiplications with respect to the
size of the message space and selected parameters. Hence,
our scheme can be applied to applications requiring additive
property and a limited number of scalar multiplications. For
instance, private set operations [22, 33, 43] and electronic
voting [17] require only one scalar multiplication. We pro-
vide a threshold version of our scheme for smooth adoption
to such applications.
Finally, we propose a way to advance the advantage of the
proposed scheme. To be concrete, we present a method to
eﬃciently evaluate symmetric polynomials by additionally
giving encryptions of powers of messages. This is particu-
larly eﬃcient when evaluating low-degree symmetric poly-
nomials in many variances, such as the variance function
for numerous data. Our implementation takes about 120 µs
to evaluate the variance of 1000 128-bit elements using our
method.
1.2 Our Methodology
We ﬁrst provide a symmetric additive homomorphic en-
2 , Q
cryption scheme. To encrypt a message M ∈ Z ∩ (− Q
2 ],
we add some error eQ where e is a randomly chosen ele-
ment from Z ∩ (−2ρ, 2ρ) for some positive integer ρ. We
then perform modular reductions with hidden prime moduli
pi. When decrypting the ciphertext, we use the Chinese Re-
mainder Theorem (CRT) to obtain M + eQ and remove an
error by modular reduction with modulus Q. The ciphertext
corresponding to the sum of messages can be obtained from
component-wise additions among ciphertexts.
One may try to apply a generic conversion [42] using ad-
ditive homomorphic property to convert our symmetric en-
cryption into an asymmetric one. Since the output length
of the addition algorithm of our scheme is logarithmic in
the number of input ciphertexts, we can apply this conver-
sion to our scheme when the message space is Z2. However,
there is no such conversion when the message space is larger
than Z2. Moreover, since pi’s are hidden in our scheme,
the subset sum functions of encryption of zeros are not 2-
universal hash functions and hence we can not apply the
classical leftover hash lemma to our scheme. To overcome
this obstacle, we consider a lattice generated by two vectors
which are encryption of zeros and satisfy some constraints.
Then, we choose some encryption of zeros which are in the
half-open parallelepiped generated by this lattice and deﬁne
an encryption algorithm by adding the subset sum function
of them and the relatively large constant times basis vectors
to a message.
To provide a security analysis of our construction, we in-
troduce a new hard problem, the co-Approximate Common
Divisor (co-ACD) problem. Informally, the co-ACD prob-
lem is to ﬁnd a nontrivial factor ofQk
i=1 pi when polynomi-
ally many vectors (eQ mod p1, ··· , eQ mod pk) are given for
a public integer Q and a randomly chosen e ∈ Z∩ (−2ρ, 2ρ).
Here, we note that (eQ mod p1, eQ mod p2) is of form of
ciphertext of zeros in our encryption scheme. The name of
the co-ACD problem is derived from the similarity with the
(extended) ACD problem, which has been used to prove the
security of the recently proposed somewhat/fully homomor-
phic encryption schemes over the integers [47, 14, 15, 9].
The diﬀerence between two problems is only the sampling
distributions of the problem instances: One is from erro-
neous outputs of the CRT homomorphism, and the other
from erroneous outputs of its inverse. To validate the hard-
ness of this problem, we consider various attacks, includ-
ing all known attacks against the ACD problem: Chen and
Nguyen [8] and Coron et al. [15] attacks, simultaneous Dio-
phantine approximation, orthogonal lattice attacks, and the
Coppersmith attack [12]. Based on these analyses, we pro-
vide speciﬁc parameters for our scheme and it shows that the
public key size of our scheme is about 1000 times larger than
the previous [41, 32], but it is around 1.3 MB. Our scheme
also has a comparable ciphertext size to the previous best
result [41, 32].
1.3 Related Work
There have been various studies for constructing additive
homomorphic encryption schemes under various assumptions.
Goldwasser and Micali [27] proposed the scheme which sup-
ports additions on Z2 using the quadratic residuosity as-
sumption. Later, Benaloh [2] extended the message space
to Zp for a prime p under the prime residuosity assump-
tion and Naccache and Stern [35] subsequently extended the
for small primes pi’s. Recently,
message space to Z
Joye and Libert [32] modiﬁed a scheme so that its message
space is Z2k under the 2k-th residuosity assumption. Since
these schemes should solve a discrete logarithm problem over
their message spaces for decryption, either their decryption
algorithms are very ineﬃcient or their message spaces are
limited.

Qk
Okamoto and Uchiyama [39] proposed a diﬀerent approach
on Z∗
p2q under assuming that factoring p2q is hard. Pail-
lier [41] presented the construction on Z∗
N 2 under a new as-
sumption, the decisional residuosity assumption, and Dam-
g˚ard and Jurik [20] generalized Paillier cryptosystem to the
scheme on ZN s+1 for s ≥ 1. Their message spaces are either
Zp for a hidden prime p or ZN s for an RSA modulus N , and
hence they are also limited.
In 2005, Boneh et al. [3] proposed an additive homo-
morphic encryption supporting one multiplication, but their
scheme has to solve a discrete logarithm problem for decryp-
tion. Recent fully or somewhat homomorphic encryption
schemes [26, 34, 36, 5, 9] have also the additive homomor-
phic property, but their public key and ciphertext size are
much larger than (at least 10 times) those of ours.
1.4 Organization
We provide our symmetric additive homomorphic encryp-
tion scheme in Section 2 and convert it into a public version
in Section 3. Section 4 analyzes the hardness of the co-
ACD problem by applying well-known techniques and de-
vising dedicated attacks. Some speciﬁc parameters and im-
plementation results are presented in Section 5. Section 6
provides a threshold version of our encryption scheme and
Section 7 explores various applications.

We say a function f : N → R is negligible if for every c,
there exists nc such that f (n) ≤ n−c for every n ≥ nc.
Throughout the paper, we will use the following parame-

ρ: the bit length of the error
η: the bit length of secret primes

a product of secret primes
Q: the size of the message space

fresh ciphertexts
m: the number of public keys
2.1 Construction
In this subsection, we present our symmetric additive ho-
momorphic encryption scheme. Our scheme is constructed
by adopting the recently proposed technique for constructing
homomorphic encryption schemes to the inverse function of
CRT. More precisely, we encode a message by adding some
error, and perform modular reductions with hidden prime
moduli in the encryption phase. Then, we decrypt a cipher-
text by applying the CRT, and then by removing the error
using a modular reduction.
The details of our scheme are as follows:
• Setup(1λ) : Generate two η-bit distinct primes p1, p2
and a positive integer Q for the message space which
satisfy gcd(Q, pi) = 1. Set N := p1p2. For each i, com-
pute a unique positive integer ¯pi ∈ [1, N ) that is con-
gruent to 1 modulo pi and 0 modulo the other prime.
Then each ¯pi can be written as
¯pi = pj(cid:0)p−1
j mod pi(cid:1) mod N
for j 6= i. Output the secret key sk = {N, p1, p2, ¯p1, ¯p2}.
• Enc(sk, M ): Choose e ← Z ∩ (−2ρ, 2ρ). For a given
message M ∈ ZQ, compute a vector
