signment and ﬁrewalls.
To support this claim, Table 4 counts prediction failures
for HL28/16, tested against it29w (We found roughly similar
results in examination of HL31/16 evaluated against it32w.)
We see that 44% of representatives are non-responsive (1.8M
of the 4M blocks). Two explanations account for the ma-
jority of our misses: blocks that use only dynamic address
assignment, and “gone-dark” blocks. We consider each of
these below.
While dynamic addressing and ﬁrewalls are target-speciﬁc
causes of representative non-responsiveness, measurement
error is a possible source of uncertainty. We believe that
Internet census-taking methodology reduces these sources of
error to random noise for reasons described in prior work [18].
To summarize brieﬂy: we monitor the network hosting the
probes for local routing outages. Probes are in pseudoran-
dom order, so routing outages in the middle or near the des-
tination result in lower responsiveness in proportion to out-
age rates, but randomly distributed. Pseudorandom prob-
ing is spread over two months, so the probe rate to any
individual /24 is well below typical ICMP rate limits. We
considered packet loss and routing outages in the middle or
of the network or near probe sources are potential sources
of error. For more complete discussion of sources of error
in Internet census-taking, and validation studies, we refer to
prior work [18].
Deﬁning stable blocks: Blocks that lack stable ad-
dresses makes representative selection inherently diﬃcult.
In a block with a stable representative, it will likely remain
responsive, but if all addresses in the block are unstable
then the probability a representative will respond is equal
to the occupancy of that block and independent of prior his-
tory. Addresses can lack stability either because the hosts
using the addresses are only on intermittently, or because ad-
dresses in the block are allocated dynamically to a changing
population of computers. Multiple groups have used diﬀer-
ent techniques to identify dynamically assigned addresses in
the Internet [27, 34, 5]. A recent study estimates that about
40% of responsive Internet blocks are dynamic based on In-
ternet address surveys using ICMP probes taken every 11
minutes for two weeks [5]. (We assume here that non-stable
blocks are primarily due to dynamic addressing.)
To evaluate the prevalence of stable and non-stable blocks,
we would like to identify them from the history that we col-
lect. Prior analysis of surveys used address availability and
volatility to identify dynamic addressing. Availability is the
fraction of times the address responds in all probes, while
volatility is the fraction of times the address changes be-
tween responsive and non-responsive [5]. While appropriate
for survey data with 11-minute probes, volatility makes less
sense when probes are months apart.
To identify stable blocks with infrequent probes, deﬁne a
new metric, truncated availability, the fraction of time an
address responds from its ﬁrst positive response. More for-
mally, if ri(a) is the response of address a to the ith probe,
the raw and scaled availability, A∗(a) and A(a) (from [5])
and truncated availability, At(a) are:
A∗(a) =
Nh
X
1
ri
A(a) = A∗(a)/Nh
At(a) = A∗(a)/L∗(a)
where L∗(a) is the length of a history, in observations, from
the ﬁrst positive response to the present.
While both volatility and truncated availability are corre-
lated, we found that low volatility and high truncated avail-
ability are both good predictors a stable block. Low At
values are a good predictor of intermittently used addresses.
Continuing the examples in Figure 2, 00001111 has At = 1,
while 01010101 has At = 0.57.
While At is good at diﬀerentiating between these solid
(00001111) and intermittent (01010101) addresses, it inter-
acts with gone-dark addresses, which will have a string of
trailing 0s.
From these, we deﬁne a stable representative as At ≥ 0.9.
From Table 4 We ﬁnd that 43% of all representatives are
not stable by At  0.9). Representa-
tives with poor truncated availability (At < 0.9) account for
more than two-thirds of non-responses. We conclude there
are many unstable blocks, such blocks simply cannot be ex-
pected to support stable representatives. Also note, by our
deﬁnition of gone-dark, dark blocks also qualify as not stable
(because At < 0.9).
To show our choice of threshold for At does not alter our
conclusion, Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of At
for both non-responsive and responsive representatives. It
shows a large diﬀerence in responsiveness for any value of
At.
4.2 Completeness
To evaluate completeness, Figure 4 shows the absolute
number of representatives for using 16-deep histories through
ﬁve diﬀerent censuses, and Table 6 shows the raw data. We
consistently see that about one-third of blocks have some
history data allowing an informed selection of representa-
tives (the white region of the graphs, with around 4.2M

blocks). By contrast, about two-thirds of blocks have never
responded (the top grey regions)
In addition, this data shows gone-dark selection from Sec-
tion 3.4. We identify about 0.3–1.5% of allocated blocks as
formerly responsive (the black region in the middle of Fig-
ure 4).
To guarantee completeness, we select random represen-
tatives for never-responsive blocks. However, we can see
that we can provide informed choices for only a third of
blocks. Finally, we note that IANA only releases new allo-
cation maps quarterly, and routing studies suggest this space
becomes routable gradually [3], so we expect our hitlist to
be useful for at least three months, about the frequency we
update them.
4.3 Stability and Inertia
We next consider two aspects of hitlist stability: how
much churn is there in the hitlist, with and without a rep-
resentative inertia, and how much does inertia reduce pre-
diction accuracy.
Recall that inertia is the amount I by which prediction
score must improve to change representatives. An inertia
I = 0 means we always pick the highest rank address in
