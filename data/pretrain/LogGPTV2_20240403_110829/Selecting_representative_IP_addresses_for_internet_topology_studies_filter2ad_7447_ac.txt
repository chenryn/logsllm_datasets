### Assignment and Firewalls

To support our claim, Table 4 provides the count of prediction failures for HL28/16 when tested against it29w. Similar results were observed when evaluating HL31/16 against it32w. Our findings indicate that 44% of representatives are non-responsive (1.8M out of 4M blocks). Two primary explanations account for the majority of these misses: blocks that use only dynamic address assignment and "gone-dark" blocks. We will discuss each of these in detail below.

#### Dynamic Addressing and Firewalls

Dynamic addressing and firewalls are specific causes of representative non-responsiveness. However, measurement error is another potential source of uncertainty. We believe that the Internet census-taking methodology reduces these sources of error to random noise, as described in prior work [18]. Briefly, we monitor the network hosting the probes for local routing outages. Probes are sent in pseudorandom order, so any routing outages in the middle or near the destination result in lower responsiveness, but this is randomly distributed. Pseudorandom probing is spread over two months, ensuring that the probe rate to any individual /24 block is well below typical ICMP rate limits. Packet loss and routing outages in the middle or near probe sources are potential sources of error. For a more comprehensive discussion on error sources and validation studies, refer to prior work [18].

#### Defining Stable Blocks

Blocks that lack stable addresses make representative selection inherently difficult. In a block with a stable representative, it is likely to remain responsive. However, if all addresses in the block are unstable, the probability that a representative will respond is equal to the occupancy of that block and independent of prior history. Addresses can be unstable either because the hosts using them are only intermittently online, or because addresses in the block are dynamically allocated to a changing population of computers. Multiple groups have used different techniques to identify dynamically assigned addresses in the Internet [27, 34, 5]. A recent study estimates that about 40% of responsive Internet blocks are dynamic, based on Internet address surveys using ICMP probes taken every 11 minutes for two weeks [5]. We assume here that non-stable blocks are primarily due to dynamic addressing.

To evaluate the prevalence of stable and non-stable blocks, we aim to identify them from the historical data we collect. Prior analysis of surveys used address availability and volatility to identify dynamic addressing. Availability is the fraction of times an address responds to all probes, while volatility is the fraction of times the address changes between responsive and non-responsive states [5]. While appropriate for survey data with 11-minute probes, volatility is less meaningful when probes are months apart.

To identify stable blocks with infrequent probes, we define a new metric: truncated availability, which is the fraction of time an address responds from its first positive response. Formally, if \( r_i(a) \) is the response of address \( a \) to the \( i \)-th probe, the raw and scaled availability \( A^*(a) \) and \( A(a) \) (from [5]) and truncated availability \( A_t(a) \) are:

\[
A^*(a) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_h} r_i
\]

\[
A(a) = \frac{A^*(a)}{N_h}
\]

\[
A_t(a) = \frac{A^*(a)}{L^*(a)}
\]

where \( L^*(a) \) is the length of the history, in observations, from the first positive response to the present.

While both volatility and truncated availability are correlated, we found that low volatility and high truncated availability are good predictors of a stable block. Low \( A_t \) values are a good predictor of intermittently used addresses. For example, in Figure 2, the address 00001111 has \( A_t = 1 \), while 01010101 has \( A_t = 0.57 \).

While \( A_t \) is effective at differentiating between solid (00001111) and intermittent (01010101) addresses, it interacts with gone-dark addresses, which will have a string of trailing 0s.

We define a stable representative as one with \( A_t \geq 0.9 \). From Table 4, we find that 43% of all representatives are not stable by this criterion. Representatives with poor truncated availability (\( A_t < 0.9 \)) account for more than two-thirds of non-responses. We conclude that there are many unstable blocks, and such blocks cannot be expected to support stable representatives. Additionally, by our definition of gone-dark, dark blocks also qualify as not stable (because \( A_t < 0.9 \)).

To show that our choice of threshold for \( A_t \) does not alter our conclusion, Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of \( A_t \) for both non-responsive and responsive representatives. It demonstrates a significant difference in responsiveness for any value of \( A_t \).

### Completeness

To evaluate completeness, Figure 4 shows the absolute number of representatives using 16-deep histories through five different censuses, and Table 6 presents the raw data. We consistently observe that about one-third of blocks have some historical data, allowing for informed representative selection (the white region of the graphs, with around 4.2M blocks). By contrast, about two-thirds of blocks have never responded (the top grey regions).

Additionally, this data shows the gone-dark selection from Section 3.4. We identify about 0.3â€“1.5% of allocated blocks as formerly responsive (the black region in the middle of Figure 4).

To ensure completeness, we select random representatives for never-responsive blocks. However, we can provide informed choices for only a third of blocks. Finally, we note that IANA releases new allocation maps quarterly, and routing studies suggest that this space becomes routable gradually [3], so we expect our hitlist to be useful for at least three months, which is the frequency we update them.

### Stability and Inertia

Next, we consider two aspects of hitlist stability: the amount of churn in the hitlist with and without representative inertia, and how much inertia reduces prediction accuracy.

Recall that inertia is the amount \( I \) by which the prediction score must improve to change representatives. An inertia \( I = 0 \) means we always pick the highest-ranked address. 

Table 6 shows the released hitlists to date, by the last census used in prediction. The top group of rows shows the hitlist composition, including churn (changed) and new representatives relative to the prior hitlist. The bottom line, responsiveness, evaluates the hitlist against the census.

Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative distribution of \( A_t \) for the responsive part of \( N_p \), the non-responsive part of \( N_p \), and all \( N_p \).
