Assistant: suitable log analysis and exception troubleshooting solution includes the following steps: 1. Collecting logs First, it is necessary to determine which logs need to be collected, such as operating systems, databases, web servers, and applications. Configure logs to be sent to a central collector or use a third-party log collection service for collection. 2. Design log analysis rules Design appropriate log analysis rules based on actual needs and business characteristics. You can use open source log analysis tools, such as Rizhiyi, Graylog, or Splunk. 3. Alert settings Set corresponding alert rules based on log analysis results. When an abnormality or error occurs in the system, the relevant person in charge is quickly notified through the early warning method, so as to quickly respond and troubleshoot the problem. 4. Troubleshooting When an early warning is received, troubleshoot immediately. According to the log analysis results, locate the problem and adjust the corresponding parameters or perform repair operations. 5. Monitor performance Continuously monitor system performance, identify problems and fix them in a timely manner. You can use system performance monitoring tools, such as New Relic or Zabbix, to monitor system performance and resource usage. The above steps can establish a complete set of log analysis and exception troubleshooting solutions to quickly respond to and solve system failures.
