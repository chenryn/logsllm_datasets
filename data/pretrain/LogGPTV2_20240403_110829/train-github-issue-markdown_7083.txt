**Description:**

When attempting to create an array with a value that exceeds the maximum limit for `int32`, the following behavior is observed:

```python
array(2**32, int32)
```
**Output:**
```
OverflowError
```

However, when using a slightly smaller value, the result is different:

```python
array(2**30, int32)
```
**Output:**
```
0
```

It would be greatly appreciated if there were a way to make these two commands produce the same output. Perhaps a configuration flag, such as "I love overflow errors," could be implemented to handle this. This feature would be particularly useful for my specific needs.

Thank you.
