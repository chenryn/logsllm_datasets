#### Describe the workflow you want to enable
To be able to use `metrics.plot_confusion_matrix` in the same way as
`metrics.confusion_matrix`
#### Describe your proposed solution
To add an optional `y_pred` argument to `metrics.plot_confusion_matrix`
#### Additional context
I find it a bit confusing and incoherent that `confusion_matrix` supports a
`y_pred` argument but `plot_confusion_matrix` does not. I do not know the
rationale behind the actual implementation, but I was expecting these two
functions from the same package to have a similar interface.
