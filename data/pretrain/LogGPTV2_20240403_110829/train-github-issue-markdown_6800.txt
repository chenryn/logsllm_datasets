Subject: Issue with `⌘` + `W` Shortcut in Development Mode Using Electron and `electron-prebuilt`

Hello,

I am currently developing a desktop application using Electron, and I have incorporated `electron-prebuilt` into my development environment. During the development phase, I encountered an issue where the `⌘` + `W` keyboard shortcut (on macOS) does not function as expected. However, this problem only appears in the development version of the app and not in the built version.

I previously reported this issue in the [electron-userland/electron-prebuilt#129](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-prebuilt/issues/129) thread. I was then advised to bring it up here for further assistance.

Thank you for your help in advance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
