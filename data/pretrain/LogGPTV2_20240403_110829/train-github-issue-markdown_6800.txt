Hi, I am building a desktop app with Electron and I am using `electron-
prebuit` in development.
My issue is that I would like to use the `âŒ˜` \+ `W` shortcut (on my Mac)..
This does not happen in the built version of my app though. Happens only in
development.
I mentioned this in electron-userland/electron-prebuilt#129, but I was
prompted to mention in here actually.
