### Prefetching and Security Cache Optimization

Prefetching involves uploading content directly to the client's browser. This technique requires the installation of a client-side software component and provides benefits over staged release only in specific scenarios, such as pages with very large embedded objects.

**Table 6: Security Cache Hit (Broadband)**
This table illustrates the latency improvements achieved when the security cache optimization is enabled and the web page is found in the cache.

### Staged Release Visualization

To better understand the impact of staged release, Figure 4 depicts the sequence of web object completion events during the download and rendering of a page.

- **Figure 4(a): New York Times Page**
  - **Unoptimized SpyProxy (Top)**: The unoptimized version does not transmit or release events to the client browser until the full page has rendered in the virtual machine (VM).
  - **Staged Release (Bottom)**: With staged release, as objects are rendered and checked by the SpyProxy VM, they are released and transmitted to the client browser for immediate rendering. This pipelining of completion events between the two browsers results in more responsive rendering and lower overall page load times.

- **Figure 4(b): MSN Blog Page**
  - This page contains a few large embedded images, making the transmission time over broadband the dominant factor in both the unoptimized and staged-release-enabled versions. Although staged release allows the client browser to start rendering more quickly, most objects still queue up for transmission over the broadband link after being released by SpyProxy.

### Caching Mechanism

When a client retrieves a web page using the optimized SpyProxy, both the outcome of the security check and the page’s content are cached in the proxy. For subsequent requests to the same page, if any components are cached and still valid, the system avoids communicating with the origin web server. If all components are cached and valid, the system uses the previous security check results instead of performing a new VM-based evaluation.

**Table 6: Latency Improvement with Security Cache Hit**
The table shows the latency improvement when hitting the security cache compared to the unoptimized SpyProxy. The primary benefit of the security cache is to reduce the latency until the page begins rendering, although the full page load time also improves slightly.

### Performance on Realistic Workloads

Previous sections examined the individual impact of each optimization. However, the question remains: how does SpyProxy perform for a typical user's web-browsing workload? A realistic workload will cause the performance optimizations—caching, static analysis, and staged release—to be exercised together in response to a stream of requests.

**Realistic Workload Study**
- **Methodology**: We measured the response latencies of 1,909 web page requests issued by a broadband web client, generated with a Zipf popularity distribution from a list of 703 different safe URLs from 124 different sites.
- **Results**:
  - **Figure 5(a)**: Cumulative distribution function for the time to start page rendering in the client browser.
  - **Figure 5(b)**: Cumulative distribution function for full-page-load latencies.
  - **Comparison**: Direct connection, unoptimized SpyProxy, and fully optimized SpyProxy.

Our results show that the optimized SpyProxy delivers content to browsers very quickly. The median time until rendering began was 0.8 seconds in the optimized system compared to 2.4 seconds in the unoptimized system. While there is room for improvement (the direct connection had a median start time of 0.2 seconds), the optimized system feels acceptably fast to users.

### System Overhead and False Positives

A typical request through the optimized system involves several potential sources of overhead, including interacting with the Squid proxy cache and pre-executing content in a virtual machine. Despite this, the optimized SpyProxy effectively masks latency, resulting in an interactive and responsive system. Our system generated very few false positives: only 4 out of 1,909 web page requests resulted in an alarm being raised. These pages, while benign, did attempt to install software on the user’s computer, albeit with the user’s permission.

### Scalability

SpyProxy is designed to service many concurrent users in an organizational setting. Our implementation runs on a cluster of workstations, achieving incremental scalability by executing VM workers on additional nodes. Based on our calculations, a single quad-core machine should be able to handle the load from an organization containing a few thousand people.

### Summary

This section evaluated the effectiveness and performance of our SpyProxy prototype. Our measurements demonstrated that SpyProxy effectively detects malicious content and blocks threats, including those missed by SiteAdvisor. The use of SpyProxy added only 600 milliseconds to the user-visible latency before rendering starts, which is minimal and does not noticeably degrade the system’s responsiveness.

### Related Work

#### Spyware and Malware Detection
- **Previous Research**: We used passive network monitoring and web crawling to measure adware propagation and analyze spyware infections.
- **Comparative Systems**: Strider HoneyMonkey and SiteAdvisor use similar VM-based techniques but focus on measurement rather than defense. Other systems like Gatekeeper and recent detectors monitor side-effects to detect malware, but they do not prevent installation.

#### Intrusion Detection and Firewalls
- **Intrusion Detection Systems**: Bro and Snort protect networks by searching for known attack signatures. More sophisticated systems use anomaly detection and protocol-level analysis.
- **Shadow Honeypots**: Route risky traffic to a heavily instrumented version of a vulnerable application. SpyProxy, in contrast, does not need to instrument the web browser and performs more general run-time checks.

#### Proxies
- **Proxy Services**: Proxies have been used for scalable distillation services, web caching, and gateway services. SpyProxy builds on these advantages by combining active content checking with standard proxy caching.

By integrating these optimizations, SpyProxy provides a robust and efficient solution for detecting and preventing web-based attacks.
