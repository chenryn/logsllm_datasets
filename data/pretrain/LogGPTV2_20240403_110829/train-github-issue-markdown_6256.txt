Subject: PowerToys Application Not Functioning After Latest Update

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am experiencing an issue with the PowerToys application following its most recent update. When I attempt to launch the program, the main menu briefly appears for approximately one second before the entire window turns white and displays no content.

In an effort to resolve this, I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling both the latest version of PowerToys and .NET Core. Unfortunately, these steps did not address the problem.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to fix this issue? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

For your reference, I have attached a screenshot that illustrates the problem:
