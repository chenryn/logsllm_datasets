### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
I have not provided a sample repro for this as it's not something I can
reproduce easily. It would probably be harder for me to try to create a
smaller version of the code where I'm having this problem and then still be
able to replicate it.  
The app I'm working on is small and although I'm not comfortable exposing it
as a public repo I would be open to creating a private repo and give access to
the required people that would investigate this.
Alternatively, I'm open to getting on a discord call and demo the problem and
provide any further information.
### Problem description
When I run the tests I get a similar problem to what is reported in #20203.
See the images below where the spacing between `m` and `i` in the word
`academic` is not deterministic will sometimes make tests fail.

I've tried the workaround proposed in #20203 but it didn't work for my case.  
So far, the only workaround I found that seems reliably work is to do `await
page.waitForTimeout(1500);` before I do `await
expect(page).toHaveScreenshot();`. On my PC, I've tried 500ms and 1s and those
always fail but the 1.5s seems to always be successful so far.
Any suggestions?
### Notes
  * Initially this test would sometimes pass and sometimes fail. The way I got it to always fail when running locally was to run with `workers: 1` instead of `workers: undefined`.
  * When running locally, I'm on a `Windows 10` OS and I run the test via the docker image `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.35.1-jammy`.
  * When running this test on the CI server, the CI server uses an Ubuntu distro and it almost never fails. In the times where it fails, the fact that I have `retries` set to `2` in the playwright config when it's running on CI was enough to avoid a flaky pipeline.
