ABSTRACT
Online social networks, which have been expanding at a blis-
tering speed recently, have emerged as a popular communi-
cation infrastructure for Internet users. Meanwhile, malware
that speciﬁcally target these online social networks are also
on the rise. In this work, we aim to investigate the charac-
teristics of malware propagation in online social networks.
Our study is based on a dataset collected from a real-world
location-based online social network, which includes not only
the social graph formed by its users but also the users’ activ-
ity events. We analyze the social structure and user activity
patterns of this network, and conﬁrm that it is a typical on-
line social network, suggesting that conclusions drawn from
this speciﬁc network can be translated to other online so-
cial networks. We use extensive trace-driven simulation to
study the impact of initial infection, user click probability,
social structure, and activity patterns on malware propaga-
tion in online social networks. We also investigate the per-
formance of a few user-oriented and server-oriented defense
schemes against malware spreading in online social networks
and identify key factors that aﬀect their eﬀectiveness. We
believe that this comprehensive study has deepened our un-
derstanding of the nature of online social network malware
and also shed light on how to defend against them eﬀectively.

INTRODUCTION
In the past few years, online social networks have emerged
as a popular communication infrastructure for Internet users.
According to a recent report, the top two online social net-
works have attracted more than two billion monthly visits
in January 2009 [30]. Currently there are 350 million active
Facebook users and about 50% of them log onto Facebook
in any given day [10]. According to the Nielson report, In-
ternet users spent 17 percent of their time on visiting social
networks and blogging sites in August 2009 [25]. Given the
tremendous popularity of online social networks these days,
a natural question is: what if a malware manages to propa-
gate in these networks?
Such kinds of malware, unfortunately, are not ﬁctitious.
The trust relationships established among online social net-
work users can easily be exploited to spread malware. An on-
line social network worm, which was detected as MySpace.A
in 2005, launched cross-scripting attacks against MySpace
and allowed an attacker to add millions of new contacts;
MySpace later also suﬀered several other malware attacks
that exploited a Windows Metaﬁle vulnerability and a fea-
ture of Apple’s QuickTime player [19]. The Koobface worm,
which ﬁrst surfaced in 2008, spread itself on MySpace and
Facebook by inserting comments with fake links pointing to
malicious websites [17]. A victim’s machine, once infected by
this worm, turned into a zombie machine on a botnet. The
Orkut social network site, which is managed by Google, also
suﬀered malware attacks in the past, including MW.Orc,
W32/KutWormer and W32/Scrapkut [26].
In April 2009,
the Twitter social network also suﬀered a malware attack
launched by a teenager [21]. The recent Clickjacking worm
has hit hundreds of thousands of user accounts on Facebook
in May 2010 [7], suggesting that malware propagation in
online social networks has posed an urgent challenge for us.
Although malware attacks targeting online social networks
have existed for a few years, our knowledge of the charac-
teristics of such attacks is still lacking. Existing work in
this ﬁeld commonly centers on analyzing the impact of so-
cial structures such as scale-free and small-world networks
on malware propagation [38, 34]. The spreading speed of
malware in online social networks, however, is not only con-
strained by the friendship graphs formed by the users, but
also aﬀected by other factors such as online users’ activity
patterns and initial infection locations. Against this back-
drop, we aim to unravel the eﬀects of diﬀerent aspects of
online social networks on malware propagation in this work.
Our study is based on BrightKite [3], a location-based
online social network launched in 2007. The open mecha-
196
nism of this social network renders it possible to obtain not
only the social graph formed by user friendships but also
the activities by each user. This diﬀers from many publicly
available online social network datasets, which, although
they may have more users, do not have detailed information
about users’ activities. The BrightKite dataset thus pro-
vides us a unique perspective to study malware propagation
in realistic online social networks. Using this dataset, we
conduct extensive trace-driven simulation of malware propa-
gation. We further generate synthetic online social networks
by using hypothetical social structures and activity models;
comparing how malware spreads under diﬀerent scenarios,
we identify key factors that impose signiﬁcant impact on
malware propagation in online social networks.
Our contributions in this work are summarized as follows:
(1) To ensure that our conclusion drawn from a speciﬁc
online social network can be translated to other social net-
works as well, we verify that the BrightKite network is a
typical social network. We also analyze the activity events
generated by BrightKite users and ﬁnd that the numbers of
activity events generated by BrightKite users can be well
characterized by a stretched exponential distribution and a
large number of users used BrightKite for only a short pe-
riod of time. Moreover, it is shown that the number of ac-
tivity events generated by each BrightKite user is positively
correlated with the number of friends that it has, although
only in a weak sense. (2) We perform extensive trace-driven
simulation to understand the eﬀects of initial infection, user
click probability, social structures, and activity patterns on
malware propagation in online social networks. We ﬁnd that
the highly skewed degree distributions and highly clustered
structures shown in many social networks are instrumental
in spreading the malware quickly at its early stage, but the
highly skewed distribution of activities among online social
network users and short active time spans by many online
social network users slow down malware propagation. Also,
the initial infection plays an important role in spreading
malware, as malware starting from nodes that seldom get
online do not lead to wide-scale infections. Moreover, using
good social engineering techniques to fool online social net-
work users into clicking malicious URLs with a high prob-
ability signiﬁcantly accelerates malware propagation. (3)
We study the eﬀectiveness of user-oriented defense in which
users spread alert messages to their friends once their ma-
chines have been found infected. We ﬁnd that it is crucial
to have a short detection period for such user-oriented de-
fense schemes to be eﬀective. We also notice that a more ag-
gressive approach to spreading alert messages outperforms a
relatively passive one in slowing down malware propagation
only under certain circumstances. (4) We further analyze
the eﬀectiveness of server-oriented defense in which online
social network websites deploy preventive schemes against
malware spreading. We ﬁnd it eﬀective to slow down mal-
ware propagation by ensuring the cleanness of the top nodes
with the most neighbors or active neighbors so that they do
not send or receive malicious messages. By contrast, it is a
less eﬀective mitigation scheme to clean only the top most
active nodes. Furthermore, we consider a preventive con-
tainment scheme which partitions the network into small
“islands” and sanitizes messages that are delivered between
these islands. We show that for this method to be eﬀective,
it is necessary to sanitize messages on a signiﬁcant fraction
of edges in the whole network.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In
Section 2, we present related work on malware propagation
in social networks. In Section 3, we analyze the BrightKite
dataset, including both the social structure formed by its
users, user activity patterns, and the correlation between
them. Section 4 brieﬂy introduces our simulation environ-
ment and how we model malware propagation. Section 5
discusses the eﬀects of some key factors on malware propa-
gation, including initial infection, user click probability, so-
cial structure, and activity patterns. We study the eﬀec-
tiveness of user-oriented defense schemes in Section 6 and
that of server-oriented defense in Section 7, respectively. We
present the limitations of our work in Section 8 and draw
concluding remarks in Section 9.
2. RELATED WORK
Malware propagation in social networks has been inten-
sively investigated in the literature. Most of these works
focus on analyzing the impact of social structures on epi-
demic spreading. Malware propagation in scale-free network
structures has been studied in [14, 2, 9, 28]; malware propa-
gation in small-world networks has been investigated in [34,
31, 23]. Malware propagation in speciﬁc types of social net-
works such as E-mail and IM networks has also been well
studied in the past [24, 38, 20]. Common to these eﬀorts,
malware propagation is often analyzed with realistic network
topologies but under simple assumptions on user activities.
In the recent work by Faghani and Saidi [12], they inves-
tigated malware propagation in online social networks by
using simulated topologies and user activities. In a recent
work [36], Xu et al. proposed a correlation-based scheme to
mitigate worm propagation in online social networks. Their
work used the social graph data from the Flickr network but
lacks realistic user activities. In our study, by contrast, we
use not only realistic network topologies but also realistic
user activities; our results reveal that user activity models
play an important role in malware propagation, suggesting
that future work on malware propagation in social networks
should take into consideration not only network structures
but also realistic user activity models.
Recently there have been a few eﬀorts on analyzing hu-
man activities in online social networks. Benevenuto et al.
analyzed user activities at four popular online social net-
works and provided unique insights on how users behave in
online social networks [1]. Wilson et al. analyzed inter-
actions among Facebook users in [35] and found that the
activity graph formed by online social network users diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from the social graph formed by their friend-
ships. Their results agree well with our conclusion from
this work that realistic activity models should be applied to
study malware propagation in online social networks. Guo
et al.
found that contents generated by online social net-
work users obey a stretched exponential distribution [15],
which has been conﬁrmed by our analysis on the BrightKite
dataset. Our work diﬀers from this line of research by focus-
ing on exploring how user activity patterns aﬀect malware
propagation in online social networks.
3. ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS
Our analysis of online social networks is based on BrightKite
[3], a location-based online social network that has a modest
number of users. Typical online activities of a BrightKite
user include location update, note posting, and photo shar-
197
ing, and these can be done through a variety of interfaces, in-
cluding Web, SMS, and Emails. Li and Chen have analyzed
the social graph formed from the friendships of BrightKite
users and also their mobility characteristics in [18]. Al-
though some analysis performed in this work bears certain
similarity with theirs, here we focus on aspects of online so-
cial networks that aﬀect malware propagation. In any case,
we shall state their results explicitly in the following discus-
sion when necessary.
Our analysis uses the BrightKite dataset that was col-
lected from March 21, 2008 through September 24, 2009,
