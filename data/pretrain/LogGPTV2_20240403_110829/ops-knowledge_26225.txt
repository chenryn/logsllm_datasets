User: and thanks ahead of time.
I am relatively new to Linux and am using Ubuntu 12.04.3.  Basically, I've been messing around with some files trying to get Django to work.  Well, I though I should do another install of Python2.7 for some reason.  Stupidly, I manually installed it.  Now when I open the Python shell and do 'import django', it can't be found.
I just want to go back to using the Python that was on Ubuntu by default, or overwrite the one I installed manually with one using apt-get.  However, I am unable to figure out how to do this nor have I found a question that could help me.
Any help is much appreciated.  I've been working on this for 6 hours now...
--EDIT--
Ok well I'm just trying to go ahead and have the PYTHONPATH look in the right place. I've seen in other posts that you should do this in the ~/.profile file.  I went into that file and added this line
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
"import django" is still coming up with "no module found"
I tried doing "import os" and then "os.environ["PYTHONPATH"], which gave me:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "", line 1, in 
   File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/UserDict.py", line 23, in getitem
   raise KeyError(key)
KeyError: 'PYTHONPATH'
As far as I can tell, this means that I do not have a PYTHONPATH variable set, but I am unsure as to what I am doing wrong.
--ANOTHER EDIT--
As I am not a very reputable member, I am not allowed to answer my own question before 8 hours from my original question, so I am putting it as an update.
Hey guys, thank you all for the quick responses and helpful tips.  What I did was open a python shell and type:



sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')



and it worked!
I should have done this from the beginning instead of trying to overwrite my manual Python installation.
Once again, thank you all for the help.
I feel so relieved now :)
Assistant: Sounds like an issue with your path - python not finding django becuase it doesnt know where to look for it. Look up issues regarding path and see if those help.
