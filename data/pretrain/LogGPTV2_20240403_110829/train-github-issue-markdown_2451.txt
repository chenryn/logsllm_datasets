You can see this on the documentation site in Chrome and FF. When you hover
over the active element in a nav-list, you get a gray background that obscures
the text.
I looked for a quick fix, as this wasn't present in the 2.0-wip code I was
using previously, but I'm still getting my bearings with the source and was
unable to find anything obvious after a quick look around.
