User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer Ingestion monitoring, metrics, and errors:
Where do I check ingestion errors?

n
Assistant: The full ingestion process can be monitored using ingestion [metrics](../../using-metrics.md) and [diagnostic logs](../../using-diagnostic-logs.md). 
Ingestion failures can be monitored using the `IngestionResult` metric or the `FailedIngestion` diagnostic log.
The [`.show ingestion failures`](ingestion-failures.md) command shows ingestion failures associated with the data ingestion management commands, and is not recommended for monitoring errors. 
The [`.dup-next-failed-ingest`](dup-next-failed-ingest.md) command provides information on the next failed ingestion by uploading ingestion files and metadata to a storage container. 
This can be useful for checking an ingestion flow, though is not advised for steady monitoring.
