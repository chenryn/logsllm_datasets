### Describe the workflow you want to enable
When `verbose>0`, the fitting is shown as a progress bar including the average
time/pace and last fit attempted time.
### Describe your proposed solution
Implement `tqdm`-like or `keras`-like (familiar to epoch tracking) progress
bar such that the feature can be enabled through an argument of `verbose`.
This proposal is under the assumption that the iteration is accessible like
`for` loop.
### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
_No response_
### Additional context
I've been using GridSearchCV and brute-forcing parameters (regarding
algorithms, domain-knowledge agnostic) to find the best model parameters while
leaving the machine unattended (disconnect from the cloud). But sometimes, the
kernel might freeze without any indication. Even with `verbose` tracking, it's
hard to skim through the log, especially among hundreds of fits to deduce that
the process has been interrupted.  
The issue expanded from a simple inquiry of #6021 .
