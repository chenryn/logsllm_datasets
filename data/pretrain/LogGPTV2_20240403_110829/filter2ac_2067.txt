**ATT&CK ID:** T1567  
**Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over Web Service

Adversaries may leverage existing, legitimate external web services to exfiltrate data, rather than using their primary command and control (C2) channels. Utilizing popular web services as an exfiltration mechanism can provide a significant amount of cover, as these services are often already in use by hosts within the network prior to any compromise. Additionally, firewall rules may already be configured to allow traffic to these services, further reducing the likelihood of detection.

This technique capitalizes on the trust and established communication patterns that exist between the network and well-known web services, making it more difficult for security teams to distinguish between benign and malicious activities.
