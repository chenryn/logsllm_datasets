User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows that the system is running normally, with no critical input interrupts and 0 microseconds spent on critical input interrupts. The total number of interrupts is increasing over time, and the maximum time for a single instance of a correctable ddr is 0 microseconds.
