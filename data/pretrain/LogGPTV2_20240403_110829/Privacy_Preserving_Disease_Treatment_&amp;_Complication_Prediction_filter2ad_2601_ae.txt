### Results and Discussion

The results of the HDBS scheme are extracted from [10] and scaled to the same CPU environment used to evaluate our scheme. Our proposed Privacy-Preserving Disease Treatment, Complication Prediction Scheme (P DT CP S) allows users to conduct privacy-aware searches for health-related questions based on their individual profiles and lab test results. This scheme can support fuzzy keyword search and query unlinkability, thereby enriching search functionality and protecting clients' privacy. Additionally, P DT CP S hides access patterns, addressing security threats identified in previous searchable encryption schemes.

We validate the practicality of our scheme using two UCI datasets. The results show that P DT CP S is secure against different adversarial situations and outperforms two existing schemes in terms of performance.

### Future Work

In the near future, we plan to enhance our scheme to support more complex query types, such as range queries, while preserving the privacy of the query keywords. For example, a medical researcher may want to find the number of diabetic patients who have taken a specific drug for a long time and still suffer from high blood sugar levels by submitting a query like "(50-5 years) AND (blood-sugar>7%)". We also aim to improve the performance of our scheme using other types of encrypted health data, such as disease diagnosis using MRI images.

### False Positive Rate of the Bloom Filter

Figure 9 shows the false positive rate of the Bloom filter with varying numbers of keywords and various Bloom filter lengths. While a Bloom filter can better reduce the false positive rate, it may increase both the search time and storage cost. Thus, there is a trade-off among the false positive rate, search time, and storage cost of our scheme. The total accuracy can be computed by combining the false positives in the searching model and the error rates in the prediction results as follows:

\[ \text{Acctotal} = 1 - (P_f + (1 - P_f) \times C_f) \]

where \( P_f \) is the false positive for the searching model and \( C_f \) is the error rate for the training model. Typically, the Bloom filters are designed to achieve a \( P_f = 1\% \) and \( C_f \) ranges from 76.3% to 92.9% as shown in Tables 1 & 2.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Disease Treatment, Complication Prediction Scheme (P DT CP S), which allows users to conduct privacy-aware searches for health-related questions based on their individual profiles and lab test results. Our design also allows healthcare providers and the public cloud to collectively generate aggregated training models to diagnose diseases, predict complications, and offer possible treatment options.
