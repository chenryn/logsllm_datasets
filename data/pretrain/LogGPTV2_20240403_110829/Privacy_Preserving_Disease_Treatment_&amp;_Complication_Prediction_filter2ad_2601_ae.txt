1The results of the HDBS scheme are extracted from [10] and scaled to the same CPU environment used to evaluate our scheme;
gated training models to diagnose diseases, predict compli-
cations and oﬀer possible treatment options. In addition, to
enrich search functionality and protect the clients’ privacy,
our scheme can support fuzzy keyword search and query
unlinkability. Moreover, P DT CP S also hides access pat-
terns and hence addresses the security threat via exposed
access patterns identiﬁed in previous searchable encryption
schemes. Finally, we validate the practicality of our scheme
by evaluating our scheme using two U CI datasets. The
results show that P DT CP S is secure against diﬀerent ad-
versarial situations, and has better performance than two
existing schemes.
In the near future, we would like to enhance our scheme
to support more complex query types (e.g., range queries),
while preserving the privacy of the query keywords. For ex-
ample, a medical researcher may want to ﬁnd the number
of diabetic patients who have taken a speciﬁc drug for a
long time, and yet still suﬀer a high blood sugar level, by
submitting a query like “(505 years) AND (blood-sugar>7%)”. In addition, we
would like to improve the performance of our scheme us-
ing other types of encrypted health data. For example, we
may include disease diagnosis using M RI images, and hence
enhance our scheme to deal with encrypted image features.

various Bloom ﬁlter lengths.
ﬁlter can better reduce the false positive rate, it may in-
crease both the search time and the storage cost (since the
cloud server needs to store these Bloom ﬁlters in the index
tree). Thus, there is a trade-oﬀ among the false positive
rate, search time, and the storage cost of our scheme. For
example, we can tune the parameters, i.e. L, li, to speciﬁ-
cally ﬁt a particular accuracy and storage requirements.
Therefore, the total accuracy can be further computed by
combining both false positives in the searching model and
error rates in the prediction results as follows:
Acctotal = 1 − (Pf + (1 − Pf ) ∗ Cf )
(1)
where Pf is the false positive for the searching model and
Cf is the error rate for the training model. Typically, the
Bloom ﬁlters are designed to achieve a Pf = 1% and Cf as
shown in Tables 1 & 2 ranges from 76.3 to 92.9%.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a Privacy-Preserving Dis-
ease Treatment, Complication Prediction Scheme (P DT CP S),
which allows users to conduct privacy-aware searches for
health related questions based on their individual proﬁles
and lab tests results. Our design also allows healthcare
providers and the public cloud to collectively generate aggre-
