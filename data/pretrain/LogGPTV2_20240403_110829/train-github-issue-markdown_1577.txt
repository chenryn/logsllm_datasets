If you open a project in Atom only to look around at different files it keeps
each buffer opened (with a tab). If you click on some 10+ files the editor
quickly gets cluttered down and you have to eventually close the pane.
I propose an option to not keep buffers open unless you change something in
the file, then it can stay open.
