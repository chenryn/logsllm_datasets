Figure 5: Histogram comparison of time spent on each certificate case, split by experimental condition. The vertical axis has task
time divided into 30-second intervals and the horizontal axis shows the number of participants with time in the particular inter-
val (all times over 8 minutes are merged for simplicity). Note that the number of participants is different for the two conditions.
A TASK DETAILS AND TIMING
This appendix contains the full formulations of the pre-task ques-
tionnaire, the task and its context (as given to the participant) and
questions guiding the post-task semi-structured interview. Apart
from that, detailed timing information for all the participants are
summarized in Fig. 5.
However, some server certificates seem to be problematic. Now,
you should check them out.
Your task
Use the testing program testConnection.c to validate the certifi-
cates of the servers. That is, for each server:
(1) Run the testing program using
A.1 Pre-task Questionnaire
To better put your opinions in context, we need to know what pre-
vious experience you have.
(1) How many years have you been employed in the IT sector? (enter
’0’ if not employed) [number answer field]
(2) Do you have a university degree in computer science? [No formal
education; Bachelor degree; Master degree; Postgraduate degree]
(3) How would you describe your knowledge of computer security
in general? [Poor; Fair; Good; Very good; Excellent]
(4) How would you describe your knowledge of X.509 certificates?
[Poor; Fair; Good; Very good; Excellent]
(5) Which of these tools/libraries have you ever used? Tick all that
apply. [OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Network security services (NSS); Java
Keytool; Windows Certutil; Let’s Encrypt Certbot]
(6) Have you participated in our last yearâĂŹs experiment here at
DevConf? [Yes; No]
These questions were followed by the full Security Behavior Inten-
tions Scale [16] with randomized question order.
A.2 Experiment Task
Context
• Imagine you want to improve DevConf registration system by
allowing login with third-party accounts (GitHub, Fedora Project,
Google, Microsoft, Facebook). You decide to contribute by coding
it yourself and then submitting a pull request.
• Imagine, you have already created a small program testConnec-
tion.c testing the connection and validating server certificates.
./testConnection 
(2) If the certificate is not valid, try to understand the problem and
risks (read the documentation, tutorials, ...).
(3) Decide how much do you trust the server having this certificate?
(Fill in the provided form.)
certtool -i --infile 
Details
• No coding or bug fixing is required from you, the program test-
Connection.c does the verification correctly (showing you all
occurred errors).
• You (ultimately) trust the DevConf Root CA certificate authority.

A.4 Post-task Interview
Now please describe in your own words what was the problem
with the certificates case by case. (Fedora project, Facebook, GitHub,
Google, Microsoft)
Note: This open-ended question usually took over half of the interview
time. The interviewers prompted the participant to elaborate further
as necessary. Afterward, the following closed questions were posed if
not answered spontaneously during the open-ended discussion.
• Did you check for how long is the certificate expired? (Yes, No)
• Does it make a difference for you how long are they expired? (Yes,

B REDESIGNED DOCUMENTATION
This appendix contains the full wording of the original and re-
designed error messages (see Table 2) and the redesigned documen-
tation that was available during the experiment at x509errors.cz. A
link to this website is the part of the redesigned error messages.
B.1 Hostname Mismatch Case
The server hostname does not match the certificate subject name.
(X509_ERR_HOSTNAME_MISMATCH)
Explanation: The domain name provided by the server you are
connecting to does not match the subject name of the certificate.
Security perspective: Your communication will be encrypted, but
you communicate with a different (maybe malicious) server from
the one listed in the certificate. However, it can also be caused by
malicious attackers pretending to be the server you are connecting
to.
Next steps: See the Common Name (CN) or the Subject Alternative
Name extension (SAN) in the certificate and compare the value with
the domain name of the server. In case of web servers, the error can be
caused by improper redirect configuration between valid web aliases
(e.g., the version of the site without the “www” in the domain name).
B.2 Self-signed Case
The certificate is self-signed and not found in the trust store.
(X509_ERR_SELF_SIGNED)
Explanation: A self-signed certificate is signed by the same entity
whose identity it certifies. In technical terms, a self-signed certificate
is one signed with its own private key. This is common for root keys
(usually pre-installed on your system).
Security perspective: No certificate authority issued the certificate.
Anyone can create a certificate with these parameters. It means a
really low level of security and trust. Since this self-signed certificate
is not "managed" by a CA, there is no possible revocation.
It can be trusted only if you control every machine between you
and the server or you check that the keys in the certificate are what
you expect them to be. However, it can also be caused by malicious
attackers pretending to be the server you are connecting to.
Next steps: If you can, try to validate the certificate in a different
way âĂŞ compare the fingerprint with what is expected, compare
it with the certificate obtained on previous visits, etc.
B.3 Expired Case
The certificate has expired or is not yet valid.
(X509_ERR_EXPIRED)
ACSAC ’19, December 9–13, 2019, San Juan, PR, USA
Ukrop and Kraus, et al.
Explanation: Most of the certificates have a defined period of va-
lidity (the "not before" and "not after" validity fields). The expiration
date is specified by the issuing certificate authority, usually for 1–2
years (there could be cases with shorter or longer validity).
Security perspective: Your communication will be encrypted, but
the identity of the server stated in the certificate is now no longer
guaranteed by the trusted certificate authority.
However, the certificate revocation status is no longer published.
That is, the certificate might have been revoked long ago, but it will
no longer be included in the CRL. That means you cannot know if
the certificate is already revoked or not.
Next steps: In some cases, the error may be caused by the miscon-
figuration on the client side – make sure your local time settings are
correct. If you are responsible for the certificate, contact the company
that issued it to learn how to renew it. If not, inform the appropriate
administrator.
B.4 Name Constraints Case
The subject name violates constraints set by CA.
(X509_ERR_NAME_CONSTRAINTS_VIOLATION)
Explanation: By default, all certificate authorities can issue certifi-
cates for any subjects. One way to constrain this risk of issuing a
malicious certificate is to limit CAs to issue only for certain names,
using the "name constraints" extension for X.509 certificates. The
occurred error says that the authority in the chain was prohibited
from issuing the certificate for that particular subject.
Security perspective: The certificate authority was not allowed
to issue the certificate it issued. This suggests suspicious activity at
the authority level.
Next steps: See the Name Constraints extension in the certificate
authority and compare the allowed/restricted name ranges with the
Common Name (CN) or the Subject Alternative Name extension
(SAN) in the issued certificate. Report the certificate to the issuing
authority.
B.5 OK Case
All performed check passed. (X509_OK)
Explanation: No errors occurred during the performed validation
tasks. Make sure that everything you wanted to check was checked.
Security perspective: Everything seems OK.
Next steps: Check the hostname, the revocation status (by means
of CRL or OCSP) check having appropriate verification flags.
