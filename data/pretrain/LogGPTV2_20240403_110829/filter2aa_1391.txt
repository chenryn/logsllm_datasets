#### Opening Question
- Raise your hand if you use Android.
- Keep your hand up if you run a custom ROM or Kernel.
- Put your hand down if you actually compiled it.
- Raise your hand again if you didn’t look at the source.
- Raise your hand again if you didn’t do a full source audit.
- Don’t lie; Santa Claus and the NSA already know the answer.

**Presentation Start**

- Why? Because… logic.
- My opinions do not represent Accuvant Labs.
- This is about understanding a problem so we can fix it.

### Boring Kit: The Public Space of Rootkits and Malware
- It might be fascinating, but...
- Define: Player 1 (You know… “those people”)
- Define: Player 2 (Repeated for emphasis)

#### Game Mechanics
- We need all the 0-Days (gift wrap).
- We need all the Devices (package).
- Still kind of boring.
- Not the real point.
- Disposable...

#### Cost of 0-Days
- Need more!
- No, MORE!!!
- Okay, that’s better.

#### All the Devices
- I need a new computer.
- More computers.
- Computer!
- But I run Android, I’m special?
- Sure… unless I had…

#### Key Points
- The kit/implant is not an 0-Day.
- It actually costs real money.
- It takes real time to develop.
- But drudgery is not sexy.

#### Development Time
- Dev time L
- More dev time L / Real Job L L
- Years to Dev = $$$$$
- Well… it’s something.

#### Goals
- We have a game!
- Didn’t take long…
- And the winner is…. Whatever… “jerks”

#### Protecting the Real Investment
- But wait, I want to know more!
- Getting popped and burned.
- Don’t do that to poor Ricky, OK?

#### Final Rules of the Game
- "Air to Glass"
- Playing with remote code execution that never touches data storage.
