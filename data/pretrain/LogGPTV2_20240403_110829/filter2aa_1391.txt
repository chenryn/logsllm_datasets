Opening Question 
Hands up if you run Android 
Keep ‘em up if you run a custom ROM / Kernel 
Down if you actually compiled it 
Back up if you didn’t look at the source 
Back up if you didn’t do a FULL source audit 
Don’t lie, Santa Claus and the NSA already know the answer

Game Mechanics

ok, that’s better 
All teh Devices! 
I need a new computer 
Moar computer 
Computer! 
But I run Android, I’m special?

•  Actually costs real money 
•  Actually takes real time to dev 
•  But… Drudgery != Sexy
