User: I've just created locally on my machine a perfectly running faceted search service using Google App Engine Faceted Search, written in Python.
As soon as I deploy to our production server, it throws an error during the index creation, specifically when the code try to execute index.put(docs), where docs is an array of [max 100] search.Document.
The error is: "PutError: one or more put document operations failed: Value is empty"
I tried then to step back to the the previous version of my service, which was working like a charm until then. I removed all the new search.TextField added and I removed the facets=[search.AtomFacet(...)] from the search.Document constructor keywords.
It started working again.
Then, baby step forward again, I've added all the fields I needed, but still no facets=[] in the constructor. It worked.As soon as I added again facets=[search.AtomFacet(name='propName', value=doc.propName if doc.propName else '')] then the error appeared again. Whilst locally on my machine, it works perfectly.
Is there any setting / configuration we need to enable on production server to have this feature?
Thank you
Assistant: Facet value cannot be empty string. You can workaround it by not including facets with empty values or have a special value for your empty facets. The local implementation of faceted search (python) currently accepts empty facets that is a bug and will be fixed.
