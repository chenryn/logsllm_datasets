# .drop extents command
Drops extents from a specified database or table.
This command has several variants: In one, the extents to be dropped are specified by a Kusto query. In the other variants, extents are specified using a mini-language described below.
> [!NOTE]
> Data shards are called **extents**, and all commands use "extent" or "extents" as a synonym.
> For more information on extents, see [Extents (Data Shards) Overview](extents-overview.md).
> [!CAUTION]
> If you drop an extent, all the rows in that extent will be deleted. To delete individual records, use [Soft delete](../concepts/data-soft-delete.md).
## Permissions
If the *TableName* is specified, you must have at least [Table Admin](access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run the command.
If the *TableName* isn't specified, you must have at least [Database Admin](./access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run the command.
## Syntax
### Drop extents with a query
`.drop` `extents` [`whatif`] ` [!NOTE]
> Extent ID parameter isn't applicable for this command.
```kusto
.drop-pretend extents older 10 days from all tables
```
### Remove all extents from 'TestTable'
```kusto
.drop extents from TestTable
```
> [!NOTE]
> Removing all extents does not necessarily delete all the data in the table, if streaming ingestion is enabled. To clear all the data of a table, use [`.clear table data TestTable`](./clear-table-data-command.md).
