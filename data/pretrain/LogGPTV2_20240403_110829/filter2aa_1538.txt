Conclusions
PAYMENT 
PROVIDER
1.
Carry out an assessment of reader to gather preliminary data + info from cards.
2.
Use data to carry out normal transactions to obtain baseline.
3.
Use info obtained during this process to identify potential weaknesses and 
vulnerabilities.
4.
Carry out “modified” transactions

CONCLUSIONS
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR  MPOS MANUFACTURERS
Control firmware versions, encrypt & sign 
firmware
Use Bluetooth pairing mode that provides 
visual confirmation of reader/phone pairing 
such as pass key entry
Integrate security testing into the 
development process
Implement user authentication and input 
sanitisation at the application level
Conclusions
CONCLUSIONS
Protect deprecated protocols such as mag-
stripe
Use preventive monitoring as a best practice
Don’t allow use of vulnerable or out-of-date 
firmware, prohibit downgrades
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR  MPOS VENDORS
Place more emphasis on enrolment checks
Protect the mobile ecosystem
Implement user authentication and input 
sanitization at application level
Conclusions
CONCLUSIONS
Control physical access to devices
Do not use mag-stripe transactions 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR  MPOS MERCHANTS
Assess the mPOS ecosystem
Choose a vendor who places emphasis on 
protecting whole ecosystem
