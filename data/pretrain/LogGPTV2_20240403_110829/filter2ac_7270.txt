### Title: Botconf 2019 - Uncovering the Neutrino Botnet: From Web Scans to Botnet Architecture

In August 2018, our team began recording a series of mass scans targeting phpMyAdmin systems. These scans were accompanied by brute-force attempts using 159 different web shells, each with the command `die(md5(Ch3ck1ng))`. This unusual activity served as the starting point for our investigation.

Through a meticulous and step-by-step process, my colleagues and I uncovered a complex chain of events that led us to discover two large-scale malware campaigns, which had been ongoing since 2013. In my presentation, I will provide a detailed account of this significant botnet, including its architecture and the full story from its inception to our discovery.
