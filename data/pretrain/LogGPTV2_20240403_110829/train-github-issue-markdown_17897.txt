MappingJacksonJsonView is a very simple implementation of a JSON-rendering
view. There are many cases where one might need to extend
MappingJacksonJsonView to accomplish more complicated tasks. It would be nice
if the "objectMapper," "encoding," "prefixJson" and "renderedAttributes"
fields could be made protected instead of private to make extending
MappingJacksonJsonView a little easier.
Thanks!
