### Summary
In Ansible 2.1, we successfully used an encrypted inventory for deployments. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/MindLeaps/tracker/tree/master/deploy). However, in Ansible 2.2, the same command no longer decrypts the inventory, and the playbook fails to match any hosts.

If we modify the playbook to match `all`, we encounter the following error:
```
fatal: [38303030316563383161373464373362663333376565313664316663336337316131]: UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ControlPath too long\r\n",
    "unreachable": true
}
```
It appears that Ansible 2.2 is treating the encrypted inventory as a list of hosts without decrypting it.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Use an encrypted inventory to deploy.

### Expected Results
- Ansible 2.2 should behave as Ansible 2.1 did, decrypting the inventory when provided with the correct password.

### Actual Results
- No configuration file found; using defaults.
- Deprecation warning: Instead of `sudo/sudo_user`, use `become/become_user` and ensure `become_method` is 'sudo'. This feature will be removed in a future release. Deprecation warnings can be disabled by setting `deprecation_warnings=False` in `ansible.cfg`.
- Playbook does not match the expected hosts and ignores the inventory.

[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Instead of sudo/sudo_user, use become/become_user and make sure become_method is 'sudo' (default).
