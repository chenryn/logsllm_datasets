  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
ansible-vault  
ansible-playbook
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.0.0
      config file =
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
N/A
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Darwin junction.local 16.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.1.0: Wed Oct 19 20:31:56

##### SUMMARY
In ansible 2.1 we were using an encrypted inventory to do deployments, see the
project here: https://github.com/MindLeaps/tracker/tree/master/deploy
In ansible 2.2 with the same command, ansible appears to no longer decrypt the
inventory. The playbook doesn't match any hosts. If we change the playbook to
match `all` we get an error:
    fatal: [38303030316563383161373464373362663333376565313664316663336337316131]: UNREACHABLE! => {
        "changed": false,
        "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ControlPath too long\r\n",
        "unreachable": true
    }
It appears to be treating the inventory in its encrypted form as a list of
hosts.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Use an encrypted inventory to deploy.
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Expect 2.2 to work as 2.1 did. Encrypted inventories should be decrypted when
supplied with the correct password.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
    No config file found; using defaults
    [DEPRECATION WARNING]: Instead of sudo/sudo_user, use become/become_user and make sure become_method is 'sudo' (default).
    This feature will be removed in a future release. Deprecation warnings can be disabled by setting
    deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
