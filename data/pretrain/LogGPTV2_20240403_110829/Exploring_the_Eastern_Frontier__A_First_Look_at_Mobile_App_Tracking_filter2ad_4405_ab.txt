conﬁrm that ATSes are widely used by mobile apps. The median number of
trackers observed per app is 6 for FQDNs, and 4 when classiﬁed by SLDs.
We also inspect the number of apps neighbored with each ATS domain in
graph G in order to understand how well mobile trackers are connected with
diﬀerent apps. Figure 1(b) shows that ATS domains tend to appear on much
more apps than normal ones: over 30% of trackers appear in at least two apps.
To further get a handle on the “popularity” of ATSes among app developers,
Table 1 presents the top 20 ATS domains (SLDs), as measured by the number of
apps they are used by. The number of FQDNs associated with each SLD is also
shown in Table 1. We see a skewed distribution, whereby the top 3 ATS domains
are accessed by over half of all apps, while the bottom 12 ATS domains are used
by under 10% of apps.
The ATS domains of qq.com are the most popular and accessed by over
70% of all mobile apps observed, showing its pervasive tracking. 31 FQDNs
of qq.com are identiﬁed as mobile trackers and the top 5 are pingma.qq.com,
zxcv.3g.qq.com, omgmta.qq.com, sngmta.qq.com and mi.gdt.qq.com, accounting
for 70% of ﬂows of SLDs. They provide services for link share, advertising aggre-
gation and mobile analytics. Notably, unlike Europe which relies heavily on US
trackers, China’s tracking ecosystem is dominated by key domestic trackers:
the top 6 most popular SLDs are all domestic (Chinese) ATS domains. For-
eign trackers (e.g. google-analytics.com, ﬂurry.com, scorecardresearch.com) make
up the minority of ATS traﬃc: they are used by under 20% of apps. Many factors,
including Internet censorship, language and unique local regulations, contribute
to this unique ecosystem that diﬀers greatly from the western countries.
App’s ATS Usage. An obvious question is which apps are responsible for utiliz-
ing this wide range of ATSes within their code. To this end, we group the mobile
apps into 23 categories collected from several Android app markets using [35].
The categorization is mostly based on the functionality of apps. Table 2 lists the

number of apps, user popularity (measured by the share of users) as well as the
percentage of ATS domains in each category.2
There is a strong propensity towards certain app categories, with communi-
cation apps (e.g. messaging services) being used by 98% of users. The percentage
of trackers indeed is dependent on the number of apps of each category and also
the apps’ functionality. For instance, the communication category, which con-
tains moderate number of apps, has over 23% trackers. This is probably because
apps like WeChat are not only communication tools, but platforms for many
third-party services (e.g. online payments). Trackers serving diﬀerent purposes
will thus likely be embedded in these apps. A closer look at the trackers of video
apps shows the dominance of statistic services that collect QoE related metrics.
2 As mentioned in Sect. 2.3, we do not show the number of trackers of the browser
apps.

To mitigate the eﬀect of the number of apps in each category, we count the
number of unique trackers of each app and present the box-plot distribution of
ATSes (FQDNs) across app categories in Fig. 2. We rank each box in descending
order by the median, which ranges from 4 to 13. It is notable that the number of
trackers per app varies based on category (i.e. its functionality). InputMethods
apps, which include ﬁve third-party keyboards, have the most trackers per app.
This is particularly worrying, as they have incentives to log and collect user
input to improve their services [5]. Communication apps hold the highest mean
value of 16 ATSes per app; this is largely driven by certain extremely popular
apps (e.g. WeChat and QQ). The category with the greatest diversity is News:
although the median number is 9, the top 5% of news apps use over 26 ATSes.
We note that this diﬀers greatly from past western-oriented studies, where games
and education apps are tracked by the highest number of third-party ATSes, and
news and entertainment apps are exposed to a wide range of ATSes [27].
Takeaway. China’s tracking market diﬀers greatly from the western one. It
is dominated by several popular domestic trackers. Over 30% of mobile track-
ers tend to be present in at least 2 apps, implying the prevalence of cross-app
tracking of users. Tracking behavior varies across app categories mainly due to
their functionality. The prominence of some types of apps (e.g. InputMethods)
in tracking raises particular concerns for user privacy.
3.2 What Is the Community Structure of ATSes?
Co-location of ATSes. The mobile trackers usually appear on as many apps
as possible to enable cross-tracking of users, which leads to implicit connections
between trackers through mobile apps. Inspired by [19], we further focus on
the co-location of ATS domains within mobile apps by inspecting the trackers’
community structure. To this end, we create a 1-mode ATS-projection graph G(cid:4)
from the largest connected component in G. In G(cid:4), the vertices only contain the
322

ATS domains in V and the edges are created if any two vertices share a common
neighbor (app) in G. We ﬁnd that trackers are very well-connected: nearly 99%
of trackers appear in the largest connected component.
The ATS-projection graph G(cid:4) captures the co-location of multiple tracking
services used within individual apps. We ﬁrst use the degree centrality (normal-
ized by N − 1, where N is the number of vertices in G(cid:4)) to measure how likely
a tracker tends to co-locate with others (see Fig. 3). We can clearly identify
two types of trackers: the popular ones with the normalized degree centrality
over 0.2, the rest are non-popular ones that sparsely connect with others in the
graph. Indeed, the popular ones are present more pervasively among apps than
the non-popular ones. We further utilize the global clustering coeﬃcient to mea-
sure the degree to which nodes in the graph G(cid:4) tend to cluster together [36].
The coeﬃcient is as high as 0.52. We also calculate the clustering coeﬃcients
for individual nodes—the results reveal low coeﬃcients for the popular trackers,
but high coeﬃcients for the non-popular ones. These results imply that G(cid:4) a
well connected graph, where the non-popular trackers form local communities,3
while the popular trackers densely co-occur with the non-popular ones.
To verify the above conjecture on the structure of G(cid:4), we remove the popular
trackers from G(cid:4) and obtain a graph G(cid:4)(cid:4) consisting of non-popular trackers.
Approximately 62% of non-popular trackers appear in the largest connected
component of G(cid:4)(cid:4) and the others consist of 46 isolated components in G(cid:4)(cid:4). We
leverage the Clauset-Newman-Moore greedy method [9] for inferring community
structure. We discover a total of 56 local communities, where 10 communities
constitute the largest connected component. The global clustering coeﬃcient of
G(cid:4)(cid:4) is as high as 0.78. These results conﬁrm the structure of G(cid:4). As we will show
later, the trackers of each community tend to track one particular app category.
We next examine the popular trackers to see whether they are co-located in
the same apps with each other. To this end, we compute the Jaccard Similarity

high levels of co-location, primarily among tracking domains operated by qq.com,
umeng.com, and 71.am, indicating that these popular trackers tend to co-occur
with each other. Since their holding companies are Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu,
respectively, these three (Chinese) tech giants generally oﬀer complementary,
albeit competitive, services. In contrast, there are a number of trackers which
show negligible correlation. Most prominently, international rival services, such
as baidu.com and google-analytics.com, tend not to co-occur.
Specialization of ATSes. The above analysis leads us to explore the special-
ization of non-popular trackers, i.e. whether a local community of ATSes intends
to occur in some speciﬁc app categories. To this end, we compute the tracker
