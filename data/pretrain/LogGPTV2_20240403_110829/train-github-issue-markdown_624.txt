Setting up https://github.com/SphinxKnight/Twitter-Assistant, at the `npm run
build`, a TS1005 error was thrown. This is due to the signature of the
`isArray` method in `lib.es6.d.ts` which is incorrect.
This typo also occurs in signatures for `isView` with `ArrayBuffer`.
Note: This wasn't detected by running the tests.
