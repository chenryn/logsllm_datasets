When setting up the project from <https://github.com/SphinxKnight/Twitter-Assistant>, an error (TS1005) was encountered during the `npm run build` step. This issue stems from an incorrect signature for the `isArray` method in the `lib.es6.d.ts` file. Additionally, a similar typo is present in the signatures for the `isView` method related to `ArrayBuffer`. It's worth noting that these issues were not identified when running the test suite.
