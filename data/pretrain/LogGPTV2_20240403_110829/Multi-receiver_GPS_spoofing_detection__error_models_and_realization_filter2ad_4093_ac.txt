correlations of position errors (distances tend to be smaller)
and limitations of the measurement setup. In other setups,
we obtain results that ﬁt the Rician distribution better (Ap-
pendix B). The parameters of the distributions are included
in Table 3.
In particular, the noncentrality parameter s
closely reﬂects the average distance µ, whereas the scale pa-
rameter σ reﬂects the standard deviation of the dataset.
As an illustrative example, we focus on a single distance.
Considering the CDF of the Rician distribution from (5), we
are able to calculate the probability that a certain thresh-
old λ is exceeded. In particular, we can determine the point
at which 1 % of the distribution is accumulated. According
to the CDF, we expect that 99 % of the distances exceed this
ﬁx point such that
Pr{d ≤ d99} = 1 − Q1/ s
σ
,
d99
σ 2 ,
where d99 represents the distance that is shorter than 99 % of
all distances. With this equation we can calculate thresholds
that belong to diﬀerent probabilities. The distances corre-
sponding to the 99 % threshold for each pair of co-located
receivers are shown in Table 3. For instance, the distance
R3-R4 (µ = 9.875 m) is expected to be below 6.423 m in only
1 % of the cases and is calculated to be maintained 99 % of
the times, which is approx. 3.4 m less than the actual dis-
tance based on the initial measurements.
A further aspect of our measurement analysis is how posi-
tion changes correlate spatially. Since we assumed that the
system-intrinsic URE is an environment-dependent error, we
expect to detect a certain correlation between the position
deviations for co-located receivers. To identify the extent of
correlation, we compute Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient ρ
243
from (3) between the reported positions. The coeﬃcients for
our measurements are listed in Table 3. For better clarity ρ
is partitioned in a latitude and a longitude component. We
recognize a positive correlation. Even though the amount
of correlation diﬀers between the respective receivers due to
noise eﬀects (ρLAT for R1-R2 is an outlier), the magnitude
of correlation is considerable and throughout positive.
Conclusion for Authentic Signals. In conclusion, the lo-
calization precision of the utilized COTS receivers is within
typical standard deviations of σ ≈ 0.5, . . . ,3. The correla-
tion between the position shifts is signiﬁcantly positive and
stabilizes at ρ ≈ 0.4, . . . ,0 .6 for long-term measurements.
To validate our ﬁndings, we conducted further experiments
in diﬀerent environments between August 2015 and May
2016, which are discussed in Appendix B.
5. ERROR FOR SPOOFED SIGNALS
In the previous section, we investigated the localization
error for authentic signals. We now present experimental
results on the localization error for spoofed signals, using
the same receivers as in the previous experiment.
5.1 Experimental Setup
In our measurement setup, the spooﬁng attack is realized
via a GPS signal simulator that is capable of generating ar-
bitrary civilian GPS signals (LabSat 3). These signals can
be composed with attacker-chosen parameters such as sig-
nal power or position solution. With the supplied software
tools, we are able to generate scenarios, which emulate sim-
ilar conditions as were present during our measurements for
the authentic signals. In particular, the simulator uses the
ephemeris data for that speciﬁc place and time period.
Since the satellite simulator aggregates a mix of satellite
signals into a signal that is resolvable to one speciﬁc lo-
cation, we choose the coordinates of one of the receivers
from our initial measurements as the spoofed position. The
spooﬁng signal was sent wirelessly during limited time peri-
ods. Thus, all receivers obtained the same signal at similar
power levels. In order to imitate the authentic scenario as
closely as possible, we adapted the external antennas incli-
nation to the new angles-of-arrival due to the ground-level
simulator. A sophisticated attacker is assumed to send out
signals from higher positions avoiding the antenna adjust-
ments. During the (indoor) experiment, the receivers were
shielded from real GPS signals in order to acquire a quick
ﬁx to the spooﬁng signals as well as to prevent signal leak-
ages to the outside. In less than one minute, the receivers
locked onto the spooﬁng signal and kept tuning to process
all available satellites from the signal. The spooﬁng attack
was performed with the same GPS time and for the same
duration as for the outdoor measurement.
5.2 Measurement Analysis
The analysis of the recorded measurements reveals the fol-
lowing insights. All receivers report positions, which closely
reﬂect the preconﬁgured location for which the GPS signals
were generated. Within the given precision, the mean of the
reported positions is the same for all receivers. Notably, this
is independent of the actual positioning or formation.
All four traces exhibit similar patterns over the course of
the experiment. Across all receivers, we can recognize peri-
ods in which the distance to the mean positions increases,
respectively decreases as shown in Figure 7. In these periods,

Measurement Duration [min]
Figure 7: The progression of the distance to the
respective mean reveals a close spatial correlation.
we assume that the simulator imitates the changing signal
quality at that location during that time by adjusting the
impact of system-intrinsic UREs. The average distance µ
from the means varies between approx. 0.47 m for R4 and
0.57 m for R3, whereas the standard deviation σ ranges from
approx. 0.21 m for R4 to 0.29 m for R3. In comparison to the
outdoor measurements, both quantities are roughly halved.
Thus, the reported positions are less aﬀected by errors.
In consideration of the relative distances, the resulting dis-
tribution is depicted in Figure 8. To increase the resolution,
the applied bin width is reﬁned to 0.1 m. As analyzed in
Section 3.4, the distances follow a Rayleigh distribution, for
which the noncentrality parameter s becomes 0 due to over-
lapping center points. The solid (red) curve represents the
best ﬁt on the basis of the respective PDF from (6). Note
again that, due to correlations between the position errors,
distances tend to be smaller than the distribution suggest.
Measurement limitations prevent a perfect ﬁt with the dis-
tribution, see Table 4 for the determining scale factor σ.
According to Figure 8, the relations involving R4 feature
less distinct peaks such that the red curve drops slower to-
wards the right side. Taking the CDF of the Rayleigh dis-
tribution from (5) into consideration, we can determine the
probability that a certain threshold λ is exceeded. This can
be described as
Pr{d > d99} = e− d99
2
2σ2 ,
where d99 is expected to be larger than 99 % of the distances.
In contrast to the authentic measurements, the role of d99 is
swapped representing a threshold towards the upper limit.
For each receiver pair, the value of d99 is stated in Table 4.
Due to the very small deviations in the reported position
solution, the calculated thresholds are less than 1 m. Even
for the most diversiﬁed distance R1-R4, the relative distance
exceeds approx. 0.655 m in only 1 % of the cases.
Finally, we evaluate the correlation between position de-
viations on the basis of the correlation coeﬃcient. The cal-
culated coeﬃcients for latitude and longitude directions are
included in Table 4. Across all receivers, the values illus-
trate a strong positive correlation with a minimal coeﬃcient
of 0.870 for R1-R4 and a maximal coeﬃcient of 0.986 for R2-
R3, both in latitude direction. Compared to the correlation
for the outdoor measurements, the correlation in the spoof-
ing scenario is constantly higher. Each receiver is faced with
the same GPS signals and thus the same embedded system-
intrinsic errors. Receiver-speciﬁc errors only take a minor
role, which is reﬂected by high coeﬃcients close to 1.

Conclusion for Spoofed Signals. In conclusion, the re-
ceivers maintain a position accuracy of σ ≈ 0.2, . . . ,1. The
typical correlation coeﬃcient for position shifts is strong pos-
itive in the range of ρ ≈ 0.5, . . . ,0 .9. In comparison to the
performance for authentic signals, the position solutions are
more stable and the correlation is higher. Results from addi-
tional spooﬁng experiments investigating the impact of dif-
ferent environments are presented in Appendix B.
6. COUNTERMEASURE EVALUATION
We now use the noise parameter ranges learned from our
real-world experiments to instantiate the detection mecha-
nism and evaluate its performance through simulations.
6.1 Evaluation Metric
We developed a simulation framework using MATLAB in
order to calculate the expected performance of diﬀerent re-
ceiver positioning. In addition, the framework ﬁnds optimal
decision thresholds λ with respect to corresponding detec-
tion probabilities pd and false alarm probabilities pfa.
Within the simulation framework, we pursue two goals:
(i) Simulate the countermeasure for m receivers (we focus on
m = 4) considering diﬀerent distribution parameters includ-
ing distance, standard deviation, and correlation. (ii) Eval-
uate diﬀerent instantiations of the function f , which is the
determining function in the decision mechanism (2). For the
analysis with m = 4 receivers we chose a normalized major-
ity voting, where longer distances (diagonal in a square) are
more signiﬁcant. The reasoning behind the selection is given
in Appendix A.
