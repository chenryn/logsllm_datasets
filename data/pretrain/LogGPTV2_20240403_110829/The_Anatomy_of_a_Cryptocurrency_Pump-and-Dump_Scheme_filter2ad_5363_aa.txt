Abstract
While pump-and-dump schemes have attracted the atten-
tion of cryptocurrency observers and regulators alike, this
paper represents the ﬁrst detailed empirical query of pump-
and-dump activities in cryptocurrency markets. We present
a case study of a recent pump-and-dump event, investigate
412 pump-and-dump activities organized in Telegram chan-
nels from June 17, 2018 to February 26, 2019, and discover
patterns in crypto-markets associated with pump-and-dump
schemes. We then build a model that predicts the pump likeli-
hood of all coins listed in a crypto-exchange prior to a pump.
The model exhibits high precision as well as robustness, and
can be used to create a simple, yet very effective trading strat-
egy, which we empirically demonstrate can generate a return
as high as 60% on small retail investments within a span of
two and half months. The study provides a proof of concept
for strategic crypto-trading and sheds light on the application
of machine learning for crime detection.
1 Introduction
While pump-and-dump schemes are a well-trodden ruse in
conventional ﬁnancial markets, the old-fashioned ploy has
found a new playground to thrive — cryptocurrency ex-
changes.
The relative anonymity of the crypto space has led to it
becoming a fertile ground for unlawful activities, such as cur-
rency theft (e.g. the DAO hack [1]), Ponzi schemes [26], and
pump-and-dump schemes that have each risen in popularity
in cryptocurrency markets over the last few years. Due to
their end-to-end encryption, programmability, and relative
anonymity, new social media tools such as Telegram1 and
Discord have become cryptocurrency enthusiasts’ preferred
communication vehicles. While pump-and-dump schemes
have been discussed in the press [29], we are not aware of a
comprehensive study of this phenomenon to date.
1Note that not all Telegram trafﬁc is end-to-end encrypted.
Regulation: In February 2018, the CFTC (Commodity Fu-
tures Trading Commission) issued warnings to consumers [8]
about the possibility of cryptocurrency pump-and-dump
schemes. It also offered a substantial reward to whistle-
blowers around the same time [12].
In October 2018, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Com-
mission) ﬁled a subpoena enforcement against an investment
company trust and trustee for an alleged pump-and-dump ICO
scheme [27].
Clearly, regulators are aiming to ﬁnd perpetrators of pump-
and-dump schemes and to actively prosecute them.
This paper: In this paper, we trace the message history of
over 300 Telegram channels from June 17, 2018 to Febru-
ary 26, 2019, and identify 412 pump events orchestrated
through those channels. We analyze features of pumped
coins and market movements of coins before, during, and
after pump-and-dump. We develop a predictive random for-
est model that provides the likelihood of each possible coin
being pumped prior to the actual pump event. With an AUC
(area under curve) of the ROC (receiver operating character-
istic) curve of over 0.9, the model exhibits high accuracy in
predicting pump-and-dump target coins.
Contributions: This paper makes the following contribu-
tions:
• Longitudinal study: This paper is the ﬁrst research
study that examines routinely organized pump-and-
dump events in the cryptocurrency space. We use
a unique dataset of pump-and-dump records from
June 17, 2018 to February 26, 2019 across multiple
crypto-exchanges and analyze crypto-market movements
associated with those pump-and-dump events.
• Analysis: Our analysis shows that pump-and-dump ac-
tivities are a lot more prevalent than previously believed.
Speciﬁcally, around 100 organized Telegram pump-and-
dump channels coordinate on average 2 pumps a day,
which generates an aggregate artiﬁcial trading volume
of 6 million USD a month. We discover that some ex-

changes are also active participants in pump-and-dump
schemes.
• Prediction: We develop machine learning models that,
given pre-pump market movements, can predict the like-
lihood of each coin being pumped with an AUC (Area
Under Curve) of over 0.9 both in-sample and out-of-
sample. The models conﬁrm that market movements
contain hidden information that can be utilized for mon-
etary purposes.
• Trading strategy: We formulate a simple trading strat-
egy which, when used in combination with a calibrated
prediction model, demonstrates a return of 60% over a
period of three weeks, even under strict assumptions.
Paper organization: The paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2 we provide background information on pump-and-
dump activities organized by Telegram channels. In Section 3
we present a pump-and-dump case study. In Section 4 we
investigate a range of coin features. In Section 5 we build a
prediction model that estimates the pump likelihood of each
coin for each pump, and propose a trading strategy along with
the model. In Section 6 we summarize the related literature.
In Section 7 we outline our conclusions. Finally, the Appendix
speciﬁes parameters of the models we have used in this paper.
2 Background
2.1 Pump-and-Dump Actors
Pump organizer: Pump organizers can be individuals, or,
more likely, organized groups, typically who use encrypted
chat applications to coordinate pump-and-dump events. They
have the advantage of having insider information and are the
ultimate beneﬁciaries of the pump-and-dump scheme.
Pump participants: Pump participants are cryptocurrency
traders who collectively buy a certain coin immediately after
receiving the instruction from the pump organizer on which
coin to buy, causing the price of the coin to be “pumped".
Many of them end up buying coins at an already inﬂated price
and are the ultimate victim of the pump-and-dump scheme.
Pump target exchange: A pump target exchange is the ex-
change selected by the pump organizer where a pump-and-
dump event takes place. Some exchanges are themselves di-
rectly associated with pump-and-dump. Yobit, for example,
has openly organized pumps multiple times (see Figure 2).
The beneﬁts for an exchange to be a pump organizer are
threefold:
1. With coins acquired before a pump, it can proﬁt by dump-
ing those coins at a higher, pumped price;
2. It earns high transaction fees due to increased trading
volume driven by a pump-and-dump;
3. Exchanges are able to utilize their ﬁrst access to users’
order information for front-running during a frenzied
pump-and-dump.
A pump is a coordinated, intentional, short-term increase in
the demand of a market instrument — in our study, a cryp-
tocurrency — which leads to a price hike. With today’s chat
applications such as Telegram and Discord offering features
of encryption and anonymity, various forms of misconduct in
cryptocurrency trading are thriving on those platforms.
2.2 A Typical Pump-and-Dump Process
Set-up: The organizer creates a publicly accessible group or
channel, and recruits as many group members or channel sub-
scribers as possible by advertising and posting invitation links
on major forums such as Bitcointalk, Steemit, and Reddit.

Telegram channels only allow subscribers to receive mes-
sages from the channel admin, but not post discussions in the
channel. In a Telegram group, members can by default post
messages, but this function is usually disabled by the group
admin to prohibit members’ interference. We use the terms
channel and group interchangeably in this paper.
Pre-pump announcement: The group is ready to pump once
it obtains enough members (typically above 1,000). The pump
organizer, who is now the group or channel admin, announces
details of the next pump a few days ahead. The admins broad-
cast the exact time and date of the announcement of a coin
which would then precipitate a pump of that coin. Other in-
formation disclosed in advance includes the exchange where
the pump will take place and the pairing coin2. The admins
advise members to transfer sufﬁcient funds (in the form of
the pairing coin) into the named exchange beforehand.
While the named pump time is approaching, the admin
sends out countdowns, and repeats the pump “rules” such as:
1) buy fast, 2) “shill”3 the pumped coin on the exchange chat
box and social media to attract outsiders, 3) “HODL”4 the
coin at least for several minutes to give outsiders time to join
in, 4) sell in pieces and not in a single chunk, 5) only sell at a
proﬁt and never sell below the current price. The admin also
gives members a pep talk, quoting historical pump proﬁts, to
boost members’ conﬁdence and encourage their participation.
Pump: At the pre-arranged pump time, the admin announces
the coin, typically in the format of an OCR (optical character
recognition)-proof image to hinder machine reading (Fig-
ure 1). Immediately afterwards, the admin urges members to
buy and hold the coin in order to inﬂate the coin price. During
the ﬁrst minute of the pump, the coin price surges, sometimes
increasing several fold.
Dump: A few minutes (sometimes tens of seconds) after the
pump starts, the coin price will reach its peak. While the
admin might shout “buy buy buy” and “hold hold hold” in
the channel, the coin price keeps dropping. As soon as the
ﬁrst fall in price appears, pump-and-dump participants start
to panic-sell. While the price might be re-boosted by the
second wave of purchasers who buy the dips (as encouraged
by channel admins), chances are the price will rapidly bounce
back to the start price, sometimes even lower. The coin price
declining to the pre-pump proximity also signiﬁes the end
of the dump, since most investors would rather hold the coin
than sell at a loss.
Post-pump review: Within half an hour, after the coin price
and trading volume recover to approximately the pre-pump
levels, the admin posts a review on coin price change, typically
including only two price points – start price (or low price) and
peak price, and touts how much the coin price increased by

the pump (Section 2). Information such as trading volume and
timescale is only selectively revealed: if the volume is high,
and the pump-and-dump lasts a long time (over 10 minutes,
say, would be considered “long”), then those stats will be
“proudly” announced; if the volume is low or the time between
coin announcement and price peak is too short (which is often
the case), then the information is glossed over. Such posts
give newcomers, who can access channel history, the illusion
that pump-and-dumps are highly proﬁtable.
Failed pump-and-dump attempts: Note that not every
pump attempt is successful. Figure 3 shows that the admins
decided not to carry through a pre-announced pump due to
unanticipated price movements of the to-be-pumped coin.
While it is unknown what caused these movements, the
case evidences that the admin is aware of the coin choice
before the pump (as opposed to the coin being randomly se-
lected and immediately announced at the pump time purely
by algorithm), and hence has the time advantage of hoard-
ing the coin at a low price before the coin announcement,
whereas group members only purchase the coin after the coin
announcement and slow buyers risk acquiring the coin at an

already (hyper)inﬂated price. It is generally known to pump
participants that admins beneﬁt the most from a pump. So
why are there still people enthusiastic about partaking a pump,
given the risk of being ripped off by the admins? Because
people believe that they can sell those coins at an even higher
price to other “greater fools”. The greater fool theory also
forms the foundation of many other schemes, such as pyramid
scams or Ponzi games [5].
One may also hypothesize that in this case, someone might
have worked out the pattern of the coin selection and pre-
purchased a basket of coins with high pump likelihood that
happens to contain the actual to-be-pumped coin, which might
explain why the admin observed peculiar movements of the
coin. In the next section, we study the features of pumped
coins and their price movements to understand if it is indeed
possible to predict the to-be-pumped coin.
2.3 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
Pump-and-dumps in the stock market nowadays typically
involve penny stock manipulation employing deceptive cam-
paigns on social media to amass gains and are deemed crim-
inal [27]. However, since many cryptocurrencies cannot be
neatly classiﬁed as investment or consumer products [22], the
applicability of certain securities laws might be ambiguous,
and to date, regulation of pump-and-dumps in the cryptocur-
rency market is still weak [23].
Yet, the crypto-market is likely to be considered subject
to common law and general-purpose statues even though it
has not been clearly regulated as either a securities market
or a currency market. While offenses of market manipulation
can depend on a deﬁned market, outright fraud and decep-
tion do not. As pump-and-dump admins create information
asymmetry by not showing investors the full picture of their
scheme, they intentionally mislead investors for their own
ﬁnancial beneﬁt. As a consequence, when it comes to US
legislation, for instance, admins might be committing false
advertising under the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) Act
(15 USC §45) [15] or fraudulent misrepresentation. Of course,
practically speaking, these admins are frequently outside of
the US jurisdiction.
Pump-and-dump admins, aiming to proﬁt from price manip-
ulation, are certainly unethical. Nevertheless, other pump-and-
dump participants are also culpable since their behaviour en-
ables and reinforces the existence of such schemes; ironically,
most participants become the victim of their own choices.
3 A Pump-and-Dump Case Study
We further study in depth the pump-and-dump event associ-
ated with Figure 1. The pump-and-dump was organized by
at least four Telegram channels, the largest one being Ofﬁ-
cial McAfee Pump Signals, with a startling 12,333 members.
Prior to the coin announcement, the members were notiﬁed

that the pump-and-dump would take place on one of the Cryp-
topia’s BTC markets (i.e., BTC is the pairing coin).
Announcement: At 19:30 GMT, on November 14, 2018,
the channels announced the target coin in the form of a
OCR-proof picture, but not quite simultaneously. Ofﬁcial
McAfee Pump Signals was the fastest announcer, having the
announcement message sent out at 19:30:04. Bomba bitcoin
“cryptopia” was the last channel that broadcast the coin, at
19:30:23.
The target coin was BVB, a dormant coin that is not listed
on CoinMarketCap. The launch of the coin was announced
on Bitcointalk on August 25, 2016.5 The coin was claimed
to be have been made by and for supporters of a popular
German football club, Borussia Dortmund (a.k.a. BVB). The
last commit on the associated project’s source code on GitHub
was on August 10, 2017.6
Although it has an ofﬁcial Twitter account, @bvbcoin, its
last Tweet dates back to 31 August, 2016. The coin’s rating
on Cryptopia is a low 1 out of possible 5. This choice high-
lights the preference of pump-and-dump organizers for coins
associated with unserious projects.
During the ﬁrst 15 minutes of the pump, BVB’s trading
volume exploded from virtually zero to 1.41 BTC (illustrated
by the tall grey bar towards the right end of the price/volume
chart), and the coin price increased from 35 Sat7 to its three-
fold, 115 Sat (illustrated by the thin grey vertical line inside
the tall grey bar).
Price ﬂuctuations: Further dissecting the tick by tick transac-
tions (Figure 4), we note that the ﬁrst buy order was placed and
completed within 1 second after the ﬁrst coin announcement.
With this lightning speed, we conjecture that such an order
might have been executed by automation. After a mere 18
