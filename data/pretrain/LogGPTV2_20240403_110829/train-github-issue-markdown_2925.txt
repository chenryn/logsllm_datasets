but list of emulator are displayed, i tried reinstall flutter on android
studio, tried flutter doctor many times, tried flutter upgrade does nothing to
solve the issue, tried invalidate and restart Andrd Studio.  
I tried another project yet it tells the same thing, i searched on the
internet tried someone says to run administrator, still doesn't work.
what's the thing i should do?  
I'm using windows 10, android studio 3.2
