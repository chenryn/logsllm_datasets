My electron app cannot go in fullscreen mode.
I've tried multiple ways to enter fullscreen:
  * Clicking fullscreen button in native frame
  * Using `setFullScreen` method on window
  * Using `fullscreen` option in BrowserWindow options
  * Choosing View -> Enter Full Screen from OS X menu bar
Every time the following happens:
  * There's a brief flicker as the content inside the window appears to reflow according to the fullscreen dimensions
  * The operating system beeps
  * If started with fullscreen option on BrowserWindow, the flicker is white and fullscreen, and then window goes to default size
  * If started in windowed mode and try to enter fullscreen by any other means, flicker happens but window dimensions never change
I've tried everything I can think of, from removing drag regions, using native
frame, removing width/height from initial BrowserWindow options, nothing seems
to work.
I think it is OS related since I'm getting a beep when trying to go
fullscreen.
  * Electron version: v1.4.1
  * Operating system: OS X 10.11.4 El Capitan
