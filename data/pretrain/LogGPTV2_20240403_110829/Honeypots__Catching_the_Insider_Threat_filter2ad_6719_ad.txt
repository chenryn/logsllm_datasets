### Combining the Capabilities of Honeytokens and Honeynets: The Concept of Adaptive Behavior

One of the intriguing concepts to emerge from the ARDA workshop is the idea of dynamically adjusting honeytokens or Honeynets based on the actions of an insider threat. While honeypots are a valuable tool, they are not a complete solution for detecting insider threats. Instead, they serve as one of many sensors or data inputs in a comprehensive detection system.

#### Multiple Inputs and Centralized Collection

Multiple data inputs (as illustrated in Figure 3) can be collected from various sources and directed to a central collection system. Once this data is correlated, it can provide indications of insider activity. Honeypots are just one component of this system, but they have a unique advantage: the ability to adapt to the overall architecture.

**Figure 3: Observables for Detecting Insider Threats**

- **Missing Reporting (financial, travel, contact)**
- **Physical Access (e.g., card door logs)**
- **Physical Security**
- **Cyber Security**
- **Communications**
- **Cyber Actions**
- **Foreign Travel**
- **Finances, Wealth, Vices**
- **Materials Transfer to Handlers**
- **Counter Intelligence**
- **Social Activity (Internal and External)**
- **Access Reconnaissance**
- **Entrenchment**
- **Exploitation**
- **Exfiltration**
- **Communication Manipulation**
- **Other Cyber & Counter Intelligence Activities**

One key lesson from the ARDA CI&W workshop is that no single observable will always indicate an insider threat. Instead, multiple observables must be used. The diagram in Figure 3 illustrates many of these observables, including the breakdown of Cyber Actions into smaller sub-groups.

#### Adaptive Honeypots and Honeytokens

By integrating a feedback mechanism, adaptive honeypots and honeytokens can be tailored to specific threats. For example, once a short list of suspects is identified through a "broad and shallow" search, a vital database can be monitored. If a user not on the suspect list submits a query, the system responds with an unaltered production item. However, if a suspect submits a query, the system can introduce honeytokens. Depending on how the user interacts with the honeytoken, they may be removed from the suspect list, and future queries will return tagged items rather than honeytokens.

Honeynets can also be adapted. An insider interested in researching a database can be provided with a Honeynet that reflects the systems and information they are likely to target. This adaptive approach allows for more targeted and effective monitoring.

#### Risks and Limitations

While honeypots are a powerful tool, they are not the only solution. There are several reasons for this:

1. **Non-Interaction**: An insider may never use or interact with a honeypot or honeytoken, rendering them ineffective.
2. **Known Identity**: If the identity of a honeypot is known or discovered, the insider can avoid it or even introduce false information, misleading security organizations.

To mitigate these risks, the deployment and use of honeypots must be highly controlled, with minimal knowledge of their identity. The flexibility of honeypots, which can monitor different IP addresses, emulate different services, or even change operating systems, makes them harder to detect.

#### Further Research

The research on using honeypots for internal threats is still in its early stages. Many theories, especially those related to honeytokens, require further testing and development. The concept of adaptive honeytokens, which can change dynamically based on the threat, is particularly promising but requires more research and technological development.

### Conclusion

Honeypots are an emerging technology with significant potential. They offer numerous advantages, particularly when combined with other observables and integrated into a centralized, adaptive system. Continued research and development will be crucial in fully realizing their potential for detecting and mitigating insider threats.
