to  combining 
the  capabilities  of 
honeytokens  and  Honeynets  is  the  concept  of  adaptive 
behavior.    One  of  the  interesting  concepts  resulting  from 
the ARDA workshop is the idea of dynamically changing 
honeytokens  or  Honeynets  based  on  the  actions  of  an 
insider threat.  In the overall scheme of detecting insiders 
honeypots are not the complete solution.  Instead, they are 
but  one  of  many  sensors  or  data  input  to  detecting 
insiders.  Multiple inputs exist (see Figure 3).  All the data 
collected  from  various  sources  can  then  be  directed  to  a 
central  collection  system.    Once  correlated,  indications 
can be found of insider activity.  Honeypots are only one 
component 
  However, 
honeypots have a unique advantage, the ability to adapt to 
that  overall  architecture.

One  of  the  lessons  from  the  ARDA  CI&W  workshop  is  that  there  is  no  single  observable  that  will  always  indicate  an
insider threat.  Instead, multiple observables must be used.  In this diagram, we see many of the observables that can be 
used as input for early indications and warning.  We also see the category of Cyber Actions broken down into smaller
sub-groups.

systems  with  a 
the  threat.    By  this,  we  mean  once  the  central  collection 
systems  has  early  indications  of  an  insider  threat, 
honeypots  could  be  adapted  to  that  threat  (see  Figure  4).  
For  example,    perhaps  we  have  adaptive  honeytokens  in 
production 
feedback  mechanism.  
Specifically, once we have a short list of suspects from a 
“broad  and  shallow”  search,  we  can  monitor  a  vital 
database.  If a user not on the suspect list submits a query, 
the  system  responds  with  an  unaltered  production  item.  
However, if we do have a user that is on the suspect list, 
then honeytokens can be adapted and introduced into the 
suspects activity.  If suspect A submits a query and, as an 
additional 
as 
inappropriate,  then  the  system  responds  with  honeytoken 
A.    For  suspect  B,  the  system  responds  with  honeytoken 
B,  and  so  on.    Depending  upon  what  the  user  does  with 
the  honeytoken,  he  or  she  may  be  removed  from  the 
suspect  list.    In  this  case,  future  queries  will  return 
that  query 
constraint, 
is 
tagged 
items  rather 
than  honeytokens. 
  Also, 
production 
Honeynets themselves could be adapted.  An insider may 
be  interested  in  researching  a  database.    Once  a  suspect 
has been identified, Honeynets could be adapted to reflect 
what systems the attacker is interested in, the information 
those systems should contain. 
3.3  Risks 
While  honeypots  represent  a  powerful  tool  in  our 
arsenal  to  fight  the  insider  threat,  they  are  not  the  only 
solution.    There  are  several  reasons  for  this.    First,  the 
insider threat may not ever use or interact with a honeypot 
or  honeytoken.    If  that  is  the  case,  then  honeypots  will 
have little value as an observable.  For example, the DIA 
spy  Anna  Montes  had  very  few  if  any  cyber  indications, 
as  she  had  trusted  access  to  all  the  information  she 
needed,  and  used  public  pay  phones  for  communication

In this diagram we see the overall architecture of an early indications architecture.  This diagram is the result of the
ARDA  CI&W  workshop.   One  of  the  findings  of  the  workshop  was  that  multiple  sources  of  information  must  be
centralized,  fused  together,  and  analyzed.    In  the  diagram,  you  see  a  central  Common  Data  system  collecting,  then
correlating data, from multiple sources (including Honeynets).  Once fused and analyzed, correlated data can indicate
insider activity.  These indications can be redirected to honeytokens, or a Honeynet, to adapt to the insider, allowing us
to learn more information.

extremely  flexible  tool  that  is  easy  to  customize  for

  Traditionally, 
honeypots  have  been  applied  against  external  threats  or 
common  internal  threats.    However,  by  combining  the 
capabilities  of  honeytokens  and  Honeynets,  honeypots 
contribute  to  the  early  indication  and  confirmation  of 
advanced insider threats.  The research in this area is still 
in  the  early  stages,  with  the  intent  of  greater  testing  and 
development in the future.

purposes[8].    As  such,  other  observables  must  also  be 
considered  (Figure  2).    In  contrast,  individuals  such  as 
Hansen  used 
extensively, 
including  the use of  search engines.   As such,  honeypots 
have  far  greater  effectiveness  against  such  threats.  
Second, honeypots will not work if their identity is known 
or discovered by the insider.  The individual will know to 
avoid the honeypot, and thus avoid an indication of their 
activity.    Potentially  even  worse,  if  an  insider  has 
discovered an honeypot, they can introduce bogus or false 
information  to  it,  misleading  security  organizations.    To 
counter  such 
the  use  and  deployments  of 
honeypots  has  to  be  highly  controlled  information.    The 
fewer  people  who  know  its  identity,  the  less  likely  its 
identity  will  be  compromised.    One  of  the  advantages  of 
honeypots  is  their  identity  can  easily  be  changed.  
Honeypots  can  monitor  different  IP  addresses,  emulate 
different  services,  or  even  different  operating  systems.  
Honeytokens  can  easily  be  changed  as  different  files, 
search  engine  queries,  or  deployed  on  different  systems.  
By  not  only  securing  the  identity  of  honeypots,  but 
changing  its  identity,  they  become  more  difficult  to 
detect.
3.4  Further Research 
The  research  of  honeypots  for  internal  threats,  the 
advanced  insider,  is  still  in  its  infancy.    Honeypots  are  a 
relatively  new  technology,  with  the  first  serious  research 
begun  by  Fred  Cohen  in  1997  with  the  Deception 
Toolkit.4    Since  that  time,  the  vast  majority  of  research 
has been on external threats.  Its only recently, in the past 
year that any work has been published on using honeypots 
for internal threats, and we have a long way to go.  Many 
of the theories need more research and testing, especially 
the  concepts  of  honeytokens.    Specifically,  how  to 
successfully  deploy  honeytokens  against  the  insider 
threat,  and  their  relationship  with  other  honeypots.    A 
great  deal  of  the  technologies  already  exist,  having  been 
developed  for  use  against  external  threats.    Its  not  so 
much  the  technology  that  is  untested,  but  its  application 
against  the  internal  threat.    The  concept  of  adaptive 
it  can 
honeytokens  also  has  great  potential,  as 
dynamically  change  based  on  the  threat. 
  This  is 
extremely new, with little if any research or technology in 
this area. 
4.  Conclusion 
Honeypots are an emerging technology, with extensive 
potential.    They  have  tremendous  advantages  that  can  be
