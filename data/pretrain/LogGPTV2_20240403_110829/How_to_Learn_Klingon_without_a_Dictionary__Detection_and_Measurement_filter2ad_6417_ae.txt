ride [8], this ﬁnding is different. For the prior approach, the
adversary only needs to inject the URL (with the spam message
attached) of popular sites into the results of search engines, the
attack we found here has to post articles to the sites, similar to
forum spamming. While the issue has been known long time
ago, and there are several defense techniques employed by

Baidu already, like CAPTCHA and ID veriﬁcation, however,
the threat is far from being completely mitigated. We found
the adversary either posted a question whose title contains
black keywords, or put the keywords to the replies following a
question, which might be created by herself as well. Since the
hosting sites are assigned with high reputation score, the spam
posts easily got high rankings in search results. Despite the
difﬁculty of ﬁnding spam posts on behalf of the site owners,
our solution provides an alternative way to mitigate this issue.
Finally, we reported all the URLs to Tieba and Zhidao. The
security team there have acknowledged our discovery and are
in the process of deleting all spammed posts.
E. Keywords construction
Black keywords are continuously created either from scratch
or transformed from the existing ones. By manually reviewing
the 1,522 core words and searching for the explanations, we
discovered 5 ways about keyword construction and we elaborate
them below.
1) New keyword without reference. For example, “球版”
(ball board) is the name for a new type of sports gambling.
“三响海豚” (three-shout dolphin) refers to a new gaming
machine for gambling. Another example is “出肉” (cut
meat) whose real meaning is selling drugs.

2) New meaning for an existing keyword. Distorting the
meanings of existing keywords can cheat analysts and
leverage the high weight assigned by search engines at the
same time. We ﬁnd this is a quite popular approach. “新
球代理”, a keyword referring to an agent selling balls,
now refers to sports gambling. “打保单”, a keyword
meaning printing an insurance contract, now means
printing the result on a paper receipt before the online
gambling starts in order to prevent cheating. “咕噜咕噜”
is particularly interesting because it was an onomatopoeia
(guru guru) at ﬁrst but now refers to drug equipments,
because the same sound could be produced when using
the equipments.
3) Replacing characters with ones of similar pronun-
ciation. This transformation has been leveraged for
Soundsquatting, a practice to register domains with the
similar pronunciation [31]. We found there are some
black keywords constructed in this way. For example,
“博彩” is the Chinese word for gambling and lottery.
Underground community used a new keyword “菠菜”
(spinach) to represent the same thing, because “博彩”
and “菠菜” pronounce quite similar in Chinese Pinyin.
4) Replacing characters with ones of similar shapes.
Because human is good at recognizing misspelled words
but machine is not so, adversaries can construct new
keywords by exploiting such gap. During our research,
we found an adult keyword “吉彩娱乐” (fortune color
entertainment) ﬁrst, a service for online gambling. And
ten days later, we found another adult keyword “杏彩娱
乐” (apricot color entertainment) referring to the same
service. The ﬁrst character of these two keywords have
the similar shapes. Hence, the latter one also receives
search queries from users.
5) Changing character set. This is very prevalent
in
keywords embedding phone numbers and QQ IDs. There
are various forms for this transformation. For example,
“1234” can be transformed by replacing the digits with
simpliﬁed Chinese characters (“１2三4”) or traditional
Chinese characters (“12З肆”).
A keyword created initially could receive a large volume
of search trafﬁc and the ones evolved from it receives search
trafﬁc as well, even though less than the initial one usually. We
show one example about Mark Six (“六合彩”), a kind of lottery
game forbidden in mainland China but permitted in Hongkong.
In fact, we have discovered a lot of keywords apparently
transformed from “六合彩”. Table XII shows the top 10 related
keywords ordered by the search volume, using the snapshot
described in Section V-C. The transformation strategies are
quite diverse,
including removing the last character and
replacing the character with the same pronunciation (e.g., “合”,
“和” and “盒”). “六” can be replaced by “6” or even “⑥” not
in any human language. Adversaries also target Pinyin of “六
合彩”, i.e., “liuhecai”. As shown in Table XII, “六合” receives
the most trafﬁc other than the original keyword. The trafﬁc
towards other keywords are more widespread. Interestingly,

though not shown in Table XII, keywords with “⑥” are still
queried even though they are very inconvenient for a user to
input.
F. Case study
Drug selling and taking in any form is forbidden in
China. Compared to other underground businesses, the legal
punishment is much more severe on drug dealers and takers.
Still, we found 63 drug keywords promoted by merchants and
searched by users through search engines. The online drug
market in China is quite mysterious and there is no report
before about how this market operates. In this subsection, we
describe our primary results of the initial exploration.
First, we inspected the black keywords and their search
volumes. Table XIII lists the top 5 keywords queried by users.
Besides “溜冰”, the keyword meaning drug taking, keywords
about the subsidiary business (e.g., “冰妹” about drug-taking
companion and “咕噜咕噜” for drug equipments) also receive
noticeable volumes of user queries, suggesting the whole
marketplace is well developed.
Although the merchants directly selling drugs only leave
contact information through forum spamming or site free-
ride, we discovered 20 eCommerce sites directly selling drug
equipments (e.g., Bongs). The sales of drug equipments are
considered as “gray” in China, but we believe tracing from such
eCommerce sites could help the legal authorities inﬁltrate the
drug community. We ﬁrst issued DNS request to obtain the IP
for each domain and learned its location by using 360 Passive
DNS 7 and IP Location-ﬁnding Tool 8. Then, we obtained the
Whois record to extract the registration information. Finally, we
queried Passive DNS of 360 to get the aggregated number of
DNS requests since the domains were registered. Appendix C
lists these results and there are several interesting ﬁndings.
First, all the sites were hosted in China instead of United
States commonly chosen by cyber-criminals in China [8]. This
setting however allows legal authorities to take over the servers
more easily. Most of the domains were registered prior to
2016, suggesting the business has been running for a long time
without legal disruption. The majority of the sites received
a decent number of DNS queries (over 10K), and two sites
were queried for more than 3 million times (No.19 and No.20).

We found the home pages of these two sites look legitimate
and malicious URLs are on their sub-folders. We speculate the
sites were either spammed or compromised.
Since these sites run eCommerce web applications, we were
able to obtain the payment information regarding the merchants
(in Appendix C). In particular, we added some products
into the shopping carts to proceed to the checkout pages,
which displayed merchants’ payment information. Previous
studies have revealed the payment methods employed for
abuse-advertised goods (e.g., Viagra) [32]. In our study, we
identiﬁed several new payment methods, like Alipay, Tenpay
and Haipay 9. To our surprise, some sites showed merchants’
names and banking account numbers directly on the web pages
(No.3, 8, 12-15).
VI. DISCUSSION
Limitations. Blackhat SEOers can adjust the operational
model to keep black keywords hidden from KDES. They can
move the black keywords from anchors to other sections under
the SEO page to escape from our parser. They can suppress
the number of poisoned search results under a black keyword.
In addition, they could apply more intensive transformation
on the keywords to reduce the frequency of the core words.
However, all of these measures will introduce prominent side-
effects: shifting the location of black keywords will reduce the
relevance score counted by the search engines; poisoning less
search result would lead to less incoming trafﬁc and it requires
coordination of independent SEOers; more transformation also
reduces the incoming trafﬁc, since the transformed keywords
are used less often. In the meantime, we will continue to
improve KDES to make it more resilient against the evasion
performed by adversaries.
Our result mainly covers the black keywords and the
underground economy in China, in part to the data we collected.
We want to emphasize that the issue is not isolated. The
measurement on other popular search engines like Google
and Bing shows that their search results were also poisoned
(see Section V-C), so they should spend efforts to purify the
search result. We will continue our research to study the same
