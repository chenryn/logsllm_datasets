Table 7: Scaled KBA Timing Results
The scaled KBA algorithm does, however, produce a small
rate of unintentional killing in the range of 130–150cm. The
reason is unclear. (Multipath eﬀects, for instance, can intro-
duce unpredictable phenomena into wireless environments.)
In well controlled physical environments, e.g., in an “authen-
tication chamber” at a border crossing, however, we believe
it would be possible largely to eliminate the power ﬂuctua-
tions that cause unintentional killing. Indeed, in such envi-
ronments, the simple KBA algorithm might itself be eﬀec-
tive. Reducing N or disregarding failed responses to spuri-
ous PINs, with an appropriate adjustment in authentication
conﬁdence, would also be advantageous.
Another potential approach to the problem of uninten-
tional killing is to constrain the power delivered to a tag
by modifying the reader protocol. In particular, we suspect
that an abrupt cutting of a reader’s emission in the course of
a KILL command might put a tag reliably in the low-power
regime. Such approaches, however, would require modiﬁ-
cation to reader ﬁrmware and/or hardware. We therefore
reserve them for future work.
In summary, our experiments show that KBA authentica-
tion is viable, and an attractive complement or alternative
to ABA for oﬀ-the-shelf EPC tags.
Remark. As we have noted, the write operation is not a
mandatory feature in Gen-2 tags. Our scaled KBA algo-
rithm, however, only attempts authentication when the min-
imum power level is above 16 dBm. Thus for tags that do not
support the write operation, a variant of our simple KBA
algorithm that ﬁrst checks that the minimum read-power
level is 16dBm may be reasonable.
If we return our fo-
cus from an investigation of EPC anti-cloning techniques in
general to the Passport Cards in particular, then since Pass-
port Cards are permalocked read-only, this variant seems the
most promising approach if KBA is to be integrated.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have explored the issue of cloning in
what could well become the most widely deployed radio
device on the planet, the Class-1 Gen-2 EPC tag. As a
point of departure and example, we have focused on deploy-
ment of these RFID tags in Passport Cards and Enhanced
Drivers Licenses. We have shown that radio-layer cloning is
a straightforward matter, but that the implications in the
operational setting of border control are themselves some-
what more complicated.
The lessons we have gleaned here on cloning and anti-
cloning extend well beyond EDLs and Passport Cards to
EPC deployment wherever cloning or counterfeiting poses a
risk. For example, with the encouragement of government
regulators, the pharmaceutical industry is embracing EPC
for tracking and anti-counterfeiting at the prompting of the
United States Food and Drug Administration [39], foreshad-
owing the technology’s broad industry use as a security tool.
Indeed, counterfeiting of consumer goods is a risk in nearly
every industry. Thus the facts, observations, lessons, and
new defensive directions that we have presented are of gen-
eral interest in EPC deployments.
