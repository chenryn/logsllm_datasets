### Reproduction link

When clicking on the `inc` button, the displays of `nb_foo.value` will change
of value but one out of the three won't change of value because of the bug.
### What is expected?
All of the display of `nb_foo.value` to change of value
### What is actually happening?
One out of the three display of `nb_foo.value` won't change of value because
of the bug.

It's only happening when in a `v-else` itself in the slot of the `fake`
component. When inverting the condition (putting the second `fake` in a `v-if`
instead of a `v-else`) it's properly working.
I encountered this error with a much more complex example with two components
nested in a similar way.
