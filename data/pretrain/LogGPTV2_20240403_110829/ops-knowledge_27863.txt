User: Good, I am currently trying to install Scrapy in my MacOS but everything is problems, the first thing I introduce in terminal is:
pip install scrapy
And it returns me:
You are using pip version 7.0.1, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): scrapy in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Scrapy-1.2.1-py2.7.egg
Collecting Twisted>=10.0.0 (from scrapy)
  Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None)) after connection broken by 'ConnectTimeoutError(, 'Connection to pypi.python.org timed out. (connect timeout=15)')': /simple/twisted/
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Twisted>=10.0.0 (from scrapy) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for Twisted>=10.0.0 (from scrapy)
Seeing the consideration that makes of updating, I realize it ...
pip install --upgrade pip
And it returns me the following:
You are using pip version 7.0.1, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
Requirement already up-to-date: pip in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip-7.0.1-py2.7.egg
The truth is that yesterday I was doing a thousand tests and gave me another type of error:
"SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed"
But this last mistake no longer shows me.
Assistant: Temporarily (just for this module), you could manually install it. Download it from wherever you can, extract it if it is zipped then use python setup.py install
