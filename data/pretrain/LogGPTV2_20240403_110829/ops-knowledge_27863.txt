Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and coherent version of your text:

I am currently trying to install Scrapy on my macOS, but I am encountering several issues. Initially, I ran the following command in the terminal:

```sh
pip install scrapy
```

This returned the following message:

```
You are using pip version 7.0.1, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): scrapy in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Scrapy-1.2.1-py2.7.egg
Collecting Twisted>=10.0.0 (from scrapy)
  Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None)) after connection broken by 'ConnectTimeoutError(, 'Connection to pypi.python.org timed out. (connect timeout=15)')': /simple/twisted/
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Twisted>=10.0.0 (from scrapy) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for Twisted>=10.0.0 (from scrapy)
```

Given the suggestion to upgrade pip, I tried the following command:

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```

However, this resulted in the same message:

```
You are using pip version 7.0.1, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
Requirement already up-to-date: pip in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip-7.0.1-py2.7.egg
```

Previously, I was also getting an SSL error:

```
SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed
```

But this error no longer appears.

**Possible Solution:**

As a temporary workaround, you can manually install Scrapy. Here are the steps:

1. Download the Scrapy package from the official repository or a trusted source.
2. If the package is zipped, extract it.
3. Navigate to the extracted directory in the terminal.
4. Run the following command to install Scrapy:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

This should help you get Scrapy installed on your system.
