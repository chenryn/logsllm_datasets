Covert Testing
Covert Testing
 Used by legitimate vulnerability assessment firms and Red 
Teams in order to better help companies and organizations 
learn how to protect themselves.  The focus of these testing 
methods is to help said entity identify possible intrusions, faulty 
equipment / software, bad security practices, ineffective 
policies – among other things.  At the end of the assessment 
phase a report is presented to the entity in order to set into 
motion an informed plan for fixing the discovered deficiencies. 
 Used by other companies and governments in order to serve 
their own gain.  Corporate espionage anyone? 
Corporate Espionage
Corporate Espionage
“The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) pulled the covers off a 
previously-sealed case of corporate espionage by a former 
DuPont scientist who stole $400-million in intellectual property 
from his employer.” 
- SC Magazine (16 Feb 2007)
“$400 million corporate espionage incident at DuPont” by Ericka Chickowski
 (SC Magazine): http://tinyurl.com/2tdny6 “Stolen laptops fuel industrial espionage fears for UK software
 firm” by John Leyden (The Register): http://tinyurl.com/3b4uh9
“A UK-based hi-tech firm that's become the victim of "industrial 
espionage" is offering a reward for information leading to the arrest of 
those responsible for stealing its computer hardware. Thieves who 
stole a number of laptops from VBi Triscan Systems also lifted hard 
disks from the fuel management firm's servers... Executives at the ... 
firm fear the thefts were aimed at gathering trade secrets rather than 
just routine blogs.”

Are You High?!?
Are You High?!?
 After I modified my first XBOX and bought my first PSP I 
experienced the realization that the newer generation game 
consoles could be so much more than ... game consoles.
 Prior to 2002 there was very little going on in the console hacking 
arena, outside of relatively crude hardware modifications and 
game cheating.
 Since then the game industry has moved forward in using even 
more powerful main processors and GPUs, in order to both satisfy 
and build up gamer desires for 'the next best thing.'
 Now we have true computers with the ability to network...  to 
share... to probe... to perform vulnerability scans...  to find YOUR 
network... to get on YOUR network... and...?

 Cover the three key features a covert tester looks for 
in penetration hardware, and why game consoles can 
fit the bill.
 Look at the evolution of homebrew applications on 
various game systems, especially those that expand 
system usage.
 Show how a couple of game systems can be used to 
infiltrate your network, or collect data.
 Suggest things you can do to mitigate this threat.
