### 4. Data Processing and Misclassified Listings
In the data processing phase, we identified and removed 82 misclassified drug listings. These listings included units such as "mg," "ug," "lbs," "ml," and "pills."

### 5. Results
This section presents the results of the classified listings. Initially, we observe differences in the number of listings across categories. Approximately 30% of the listings fall into the B2B (Business-to-Business) categories, which are listed in the top half of Table 4. The lower half of the table covers B2C (Business-to-Consumer) cybercrime (around 36% of listings), custom orders (14%), and other categories (20%).

Our primary focus is on the B2B categories, though we will also report on the B2C categories later in this section. Before delving into B2B offerings, we will first examine the large category of custom listings. These listings are somewhat counterintuitive to the market structure, as they involve one-time, buyer-specific products or services. Examples include stolen credit card details from Norway, a modified type of keylogger, or compromised hosts from the Netherlands. Although some of these listings are indeed B2B cybercrime services, they are not fully commoditized, as each listing represents a one-time sale and a non-standardized product or item.

There are significant differences across the B2B categories. The cash-out category stands out in terms of the number of listings, active vendors, and total revenue, making it by far the largest. Table 5 provides the median and mean number of listings per vendor for each category, reflecting the degree of differentiation required for different products. Most products do not need extensive differentiation, with more specific requests often handled through custom listings. However, cash-out offerings require more detailed distinctions. For example, a vendor can split their stock of stolen credit card details into smaller, differentiated sets based on the type of credit card.

The second column in Table 5 shows the median revenues per listing. Cash-out listings have the highest median revenue. Interestingly, RATs (Remote Access Trojans) and exploits exhibit similar median revenues, which is due to the generally low-value exploits listed in anonymous marketplaces, such as common Office exploit macros. High-value exploits, like those for iOS or Chrome, are typically sold through specialized white or black markets or private transactions. Other categories have median revenues between $15 and $34 per listing.

To provide a more comprehensive view, we also present the price range in terms of median, mean, min-max, and standard deviation (SD) for listings in the B2B categories. The cash-out category again stands out with the most expensive and diverse pricing. This diversity in price is also observed in other categories, with the overall shape of the price distribution function remaining relatively consistent. Additionally, the lifespan of a listing indicates the standardization of the product. A listing that receives feedback over multiple months suggests that the associated product remains valuable and has not become outdated. For instance, a RAT retains its value over time as a functional solution, whereas stolen credentials can quickly become invalid after the first use, triggering red flags at the credit card company. Surprisingly, the median lifespan of cash-out listings is above average, possibly due to vendors updating the specific product listed, persistently selling unusable credit card details, or slower-than-expected detection of suspicious transactions by credit card companies.

Examining the median lifespan of listings reveals little variation, with most categories having a median lifespan of around one month. Exploit and hosting listings have a low median lifespan of approximately 0.3 months (about 10 days), while RAT listings have a significantly longer median lifespan of 1.44 months (about 40 days). The distribution of cybercrime listing lifespans is heavy-tailed, with an average offering lasting 2.7 months. In summary, vendors typically have one or two listings, except for cash-out listings, where the number is higher. Turnover ranges from $15 to $60 per listing, and the typical lifespan is less than a month.

#### 5.1. Listings and Revenue Over Time
The claim that cybercrime is becoming commoditized implies a growth in transactions and revenue. Figure 4(a) shows the unique number of listings and the number of feedback per month, while Figure 4(b) displays the corresponding projected revenue. The number of feedback serves as a proxy for the minimum number of sales, as a buyer can only leave feedback after purchasing a product. However, feedback does not always correspond one-to-one with sales, as customers may leave a single piece of feedback after purchasing a high quantity of an item. Anonymous marketplaces rely on effective reputation mechanisms to mitigate uncertainty in transactions.

Figure 4 illustrates a growth in listings, feedback, and revenue for cybercrime components between 2012 and 2017. The drop at the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014 is partly due to the takedown of Silk Road 1 and Black Market Reloaded. The subsequent steep increase is distributed across four new markets (Agora, Evolution, Hydra, and Silk Road 2), indicating a clear pattern of rapid growth. The next drop, around the end of 2014, is caused by the law enforcement operation against Silk Road 2, the exit scam of Evolution, and the sudden disappearance of Agora. Following this volatility, the AlphaBay market emerged and became the largest to date.
