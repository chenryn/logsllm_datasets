cess, we automatically identiﬁed and removed 82 mis-
classiﬁed drug listings.
5 Results
In this section we present the results of the classiﬁed list-
ings. At ﬁrst glance, we can observe the differences in
number of listings between the categories. Just over 30%
of the listings are in the B2B categories of our concep-
tual model, listed in the top half of Table 4. The lower
half of the table covers B2C cybercrime (around 36% of
listings), custom orders (14%) and others (20%).
We primarily focus on the B2B categories, though we
do report on the B2C categories later in the section. Be-
fore we turn to B2B offerings, we take a closer look at

the large category of custom listings. These listings are a
bit counter-intuitive to the market structure as they con-
cern one-time, buyer-speciﬁc products or services. For
instance, stolen credit card details from Norway, a mod-
iﬁed type of keylogger, or compromised hosts from the
Netherlands. Although some of these listings are in fact
B2B cybercrime services, they are not fully commodi-
tized, as the listing reﬂects a one-time sale and a non-
standardized product or item.
There are large differences across the categories of
B2B offerings. Cash-out stands out: In terms of the num-
ber of listings, active vendors, and in total revenue, this
category is by far the largest. It also stands out in other
ways. Table 5 reports the median and mean number of
listings for each vendor per category, which reﬂects the
degree in which different products need to be differenti-
ated. We see most products offered do not need differ-
entiation. More speciﬁc requests might be handled with
custom listings, but are not enough to merit a more per-
manent listing. Cash-out offerings, on the other hand,
contain many more relevant distinctions. A vendor can
split up its stock of stolen credit card details into smaller
sets of details, for instance differentiated to type of credit
card.
The second column in Table 5 shows median revenues
per listing. Cash-out listings have the highest median
revenue. RATs and exploits exhibit, counterintuitively,
a similar median revenue. This is a consequence of the
generally low-value exploit listed in anonymous market-
places, e.g., run-of-the-mill Ofﬁce exploit macros. Rare,
high-value exploits, such as iOS or Chrome exploits,
would be sold through specialized white or black mar-
kets or through private transactions [7]. Other categories
have a median between $15 and $34 revenue per listing.
As the median revenue is a simple summary of the un-
derlying distribution, we also show the price range – in
terms of median, mean, min-max and standard deviation
(SD) – for listings in the B2B categories. We see, again,
that the cash-out category contains the most expensive
set of offerings with very diverse pricing. This diversity
in price can also be observed in other categories – in fact,
the overall shape of the price distribution function re-
mains relatively unchanged across categories. Moreover,
the lifespan of a listing also tells us something about the
standardization of the product. A listing that receives in-
stances of feedback over multiple months denotes that
the associated product remains valuable and has not be-
come outdated or unrecognizable. Like an ecstasy tablet,
a RAT will hold its value over time in terms of being a
functional solution.
In contrast, stolen credentials “go
bad” after some time. The ﬁrst buyer who uses these cre-
dentials will in all likelihood set off red ﬂags at the credit
card company for irregular spending, making a subse-
quent purchase of the same credentials worthless. Cu-
riously, the median lifespan of cash-out listings is above
average, which could be due to vendors updating the spe-
ciﬁc product listed, or persistently selling unusable credit
card details, or to a slower-than-expected detection of
suspicious transactions by credit card companies.
Looking into median lifespan of listings reveals lit-
tle differences as all but three categories have a median
listing lifespan of close to one month. Both exploit and
hosting listings have a low median lifespan of around 0.3
months – approximately 10 days. At the other end of the
spectrum, we see that RAT listings have a median lifes-
pan of 1.44 months – approximately 40 days. So, a RAT
listing has a signiﬁcant longer lifespan than an exploit
listing. The distribution of cybercrime listing lifespan is
heavy-tailed and on average, a cybercrime component is
offered for 2.7 months. In short, vendors have one or two
listings, except for cash-out listings, where that number
is higher. Turnover is between $15 and $60 dollars per
listing and lifespan is typically less than a month.
5.1 Listings and revenue over time
The claim that cybercrime is commoditizing also implies
a growth in transactions and revenue. Figure 4(a) shows,
per month, the unique number of listings and number of
feedback. Figure 4(b) shows the corresponding projected
revenue. The number of feedback is a proxy for the mini-
mum number of sales, as a buyer can only leave feedback

when she buys a product. Feedback does not however
yield a one-to-one mapping to sales as customers may
leave a single piece of feedback after purchasing a high
quantity of an item. Anonymous marketplaces depend on
effective reputation mechanisms to mitigate uncertainty
in transactions.

Figure 4: Number of unique listings, feedback and
revenue in categories of B2B cybercrime components
per month
Figure 4 shows a growth in listings, amount of feed-
back and revenue for cybercrime components between
2012 and 2017. The drop at the end of 2013 and the be-
ginning of 2014 is partly due to the take-down of Silk
Road 1 and Black Market Reloaded. The steep increase
thereafter is distributed over four new markets (Agora,
Evolution, Hydra and Silk Road 2), but shows that the ag-
gregate pattern is clearly one of rapid growth. The next
drop, around the end of 2014, is caused by a combina-
tion of the law-enforcement operation against Silk Road
2, the exit scam of Evolution and the sudden disappear-
ance of Agora. Right after this volatility, the AlphaBay
market emerged, and subsequently became the largest to
