### System Information
- **OpenCV Version:** 4.1.2
- **Operating System/Platform:** Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit)
- **Compiler:** Python

### Detailed Description
I am attempting to use the OpenCV DNN module to run a DeepLabV3 model. I downloaded the frozen `.pb` file, but encountered the following error:

```plaintext
cv2.error: OpenCV(4.1.2) /io/opencv/modules/dnn/src/tensorflow/tf_graph_simplifier.cpp:90: error: (-212:Parsing error) Input node with name MobilenetV2/expanded_conv_1/output not found in function 'getInputNodeId'
```

However, when I open the model using Netron, I can see that the layer `MobilenetV2/expanded_conv_1/output` is present.

To address this issue, I converted the frozen `.pb` file to an ONNX model using `tf2onnx`, as I believed OpenCV might be more compatible with ONNX models. Unfortunately, I still encountered an error:

```plaintext
cv2.error: OpenCV(4.1.2) /io/opencv/modules/dnn/src/onnx/onnx_importer.cpp:155: error: (-210:Unsupported format or combination of formats) Unsupported data type: INT32 in function 'getMatFromTensor'
```

It appears that the model contains data types (specifically `INT32`) that are not supported by the OpenCV ONNX importer. This makes it challenging to use the model in ONNX format.

Do you have any suggestions on how to enable the frozen TensorFlow model in OpenCV?

I have uploaded both the original `.pb` and the converted `.onnx` models. Please let me know if you need any further information. Thank you.

### Steps to Reproduce
```python
import cv2 as cv

# For the frozen .pb model
net = cv.readNet('deeplabV3.pb')

# For the ONNX model
# net = cv.readNet('deeplabV3.onnx')
```

If you need additional details or files, please let me know.
