User: On my local machine (i.e. http://localhost:8080/), I have entered data into my GAE datastore for some entity called Article. After turning off my computer and then restarting next day, I find the datastore empty: no entity. Is there a way to prevent this in the future?
How do I make a copy of the data in my local datastore? Also, will I be able to upload said data later into both localhost and production?
My model is ndb.
I am using Max OS X and Python 2.7, if theses matter.
Assistant: The datastore typically saves to disk when you shut down.  If you turned off your computer without shutting down the server, I could see this happening.
