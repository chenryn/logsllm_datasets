User: if i want to script a mini-application (in the Terminal) in mac and windows, which one is preferred: ruby or python?
or is there no major difference just a matter of taste?
cause i know python definetely is a good scripting language.
thanks
Assistant: Python is perhaps a little more common, and arguably more mature, so on that basis alone, it may be worth choosing Python.
That said, both are available by default on Mac OS X, and neither are available on Windows by default, so in this case it really does not matter.
