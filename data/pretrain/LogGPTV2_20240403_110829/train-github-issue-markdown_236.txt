org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer is
overriding the "postProcessBeanFactory" method defined in
org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyResourceConfigurer in order
to register the required chain of PropertySource objects that will be use for
resolving properties. This makes sense and is OK.
But the problem is that the PropertySource object for the local properties
(those coming from the "location" attribute and also from the "properties"
property) is being created like this:
PropertySource localPropertySource =  
new PropertiesPropertySource(LOCAL_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY_SOURCE_NAME,
this.mergeProperties());
...whereas in the original "postProcessBeanFactory" method in
PropertyResourceConfigurer these merged properties are post-processed by
executing the "convertProperties" method:
Properties mergedProps = mergeProperties();  
// Convert the merged properties, if necessary.  
convertProperties(mergedProps);  
// Let the subclass process the properties.  
processProperties(beanFactory, mergedProps);
This means that the new PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer class never calls
"convertProperties", and so disables one of the extension mechanisms of the
old pre-3.1 PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer class: overriding the
"convertProperty(...)" and "convertPropertyValue(...)" methods.
I am jasypt's author http://www.jasypt.org and I am creating a
Spring3.1-compatible EncryptedPropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer, but this
bug doesn't allow me to transparently apply property decryption at the
"convertProperty" method :-(
