## Attacker-Implantable Devices
- **Context**: Malicious attackers and penetration testers use these devices to gain unauthorized access.
- **Response Strategy**:
  - **Identification**: Detect the device through network and physical inspections.
  - **Seizure and Forensic Analysis**: Seize the device, create a forensic image, and analyze it to determine what information and systems have been compromised.
  - **Attribution**: Identify the attacker.
  - **Challenges**: Develop procedures for handling embedded devices.
  - **Counter-Attack**:
    - **Offline Modification**: Modify the device offline.
    - **In-Place Attack**: Monitor and manipulate the attacker's actions.
    - **Honeypot**: Convert the device into a honeypot to gather intelligence.

## Pwning Pentesters
- **Implantable Device Usage**:
  - **Internal Testing**: Send the device for internal testing from a remote location.
  - **Reusability**: The device is often reused across multiple clients and tests.
  - **Cost Considerations**: The device is expensive, so it is not left behind.
  - **Wiping**: Ensure you know how to wipe the device securely.
- **Black Hat Perspective**:
  - **Hacking the Device**:
    - **In the Field**: Exploit the device during active operations.
    - **On the Bench**: Analyze and exploit the device in a controlled environment.
    - **Benefits**: Intercept and modify data, camouflage attacks, and steal valuable information.

## Implications of Pwning Pentesters
- **Intercept and Exploit**: Let the pentester do the work and intercept the results.
- **Modify and Filter**: Keep some of the results for yourself while filtering out others.
- **Camouflage**: Make your own attacks appear as part of the test.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Steal zero-day exploits and other valuable information.
- **Sustainable Exploitation**: Reuse the device between clients to continue exploiting.

## Difficulties in Securing Implanted Attack Devices
- **Physical Control**: By definition, these devices are out of your physical control.
- **Platform Challenges**: Small and unusual platforms make updates and security difficult.
- **Update Procedures**: Ensure robust update mechanisms.
- **Underlying Software**: Follow good software engineering practices.
- **Proof of Concept Code**: Often has a large attack surface.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Many vulnerabilities exist in tools like Wireshark, making them easy targets.

## Case Study: Pwn Plug
### Forensics & Counter-Attack
- **Forensic Acquisition**:
  - Create a bootable USB drive.
  - Use U-Boot to boot the device.
  - Use `dd` to image the root filesystem.
- **Analysis**:
  - **Filesystem-Level Analysis**: Limited by compression and UBIFS filesystem.
  - **Deleted Files**: Recovery is unlikely due to compression.
  - **Mounting the Image**: Use `mtd-utils` for mounting.
  - **Attached Storage**: Follow normal forensic procedures.
- **Vulnerabilities and Exploits**:
  - **Pwnix UI**: Web interface for the commercial version of the Pwn Plug.
  - **Exploit Chain**:
    - **XSS**: Cross-Site Scripting.
    - **CSRF**: Cross-Site Request Forgery.
    - **Command Injection**: In a privileged interface.
  - **Payload Execution**:
    - Inject a packet.
    - Call and submit commands.
    - Achieve remote root access under realistic circumstances.
  - **Exploit Details**:
    - **XSS in Passive Recon Page**: Pass regular expressions to reach the page.
    - **CSRF in SSH Tunnel Page**: Pass regular expressions to reach the page.
    - **Command Injection in SSH Tunnel Script**: Pass regular expressions to reach the page.
  - **Malware Payload**:
    - **pwnmon**: A proof-of-concept malware that cleans up after the exploit, installs itself, sets up persistence, disables bash history clearing, phones home for more code, and gathers system information.
    - **Data Collection**: Process list, command history, file listing, network interfaces, network connections, log files, and results.
    - **Data Transmission**: Sends the collected data to an FTP server.

## Conclusions
- **Organizational Benefits**: Attacker-implanted devices can provide valuable counter-intelligence.
- **For Penetration Testers**:
  - **Tool Knowledge**: Know and test your tools.
  - **Safe Usage**: Use tools safely and monitor carefully.
  - **Cleanup**: Ensure thorough cleanup after testing.
- **For Security Researchers**:
  - **Target Selection**: Penetration testing tools make excellent targets.
- **Q&A**: Join me in the Q&A room for further discussion and questions.

**Demo Materials**:
- All necessary files are available on the DVD.
- A floor-model Pwn Plug from the Vendor Area (or an unsuspecting friendâ€™s) can be used for the demo.
