    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    1. run `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`
    What is the expected output?
    coverage.out contains coverage all of the specified packages
    What do you see instead?
    `cannot use test profile flag with multiple packages`
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    6g
    Which operating system are you using?
    OS X 10.9
    Which version are you using?  (run 'go version')
    go version go1.2 darwin/amd64
    Please provide any additional information below.
    If I manually construct a coverage.out file from multiple packages, it seems to work
    fine:
    1. go test -coverprofile a.part ./a
    2. go test -coverprofile b.part ./b
    3. echo "mode: set" >coverage.out
    4. grep -h -v "mode: set" *.part >>coverage.out
    5. go tool cover -html=coverage.out
    Why can't `go test -coverprofile` do this automatically?
