### Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ

#### 1. Triggering Problem
- **When did the triggering problem start and when did it stop?**
- **Which queue did not trigger, and which channel or process should have been started?**

#### 2. Task Overview
If the triggering problem is currently occurring or can be reproduced, you can generate data to provide more information about the issue.

#### 3. Procedure
1. **Generate a Trace of the Queue Manager:**
   - **AIX and Linux:** Refer to "Tracing on AIX and Linux" on page 376.
   - **Windows:** Refer to "Tracing on Windows" on page 391.
   - **IBM i:** Refer to "Tracing on IBM i" on page 381.

2. **Collect IBM MQ Data:**
   - **Automatically:**
     - Use the `runmqras` command as described in "Collecting troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras" on page 303.
     - Example command:
       ```sh
       runmqras -section defs,trace -qmlist QMA -caseno TS001234567
       ```
   - **Manually:**
     - Follow the instructions in "Collecting troubleshooting information manually" on page 306.

3. **Send the Collected Information to IBM:**
   - Provide a detailed description of the problem along with the collected data.
   - For FTP and email instructions, see "Exchanging information with IBM Software Support."
   - To open or update a case, visit the IBM My Support site.
   - Always update your case to indicate that data has been sent.
   - For further assistance, contact your country representative or call 1-800-IBM-SERV (in the US).

### Collecting Troubleshooting Information on z/OS

#### 4.1. Additional Information
- IBM Support may request additional information on a case-by-case basis.

#### 4.2. Procedure
- **For Specific Problem Areas:**
  - **ABEND, Advanced Message Security (AMS), Client Connections, CICS Adapter, CICS Bridge, Channels, Clusters, Data Conversion, Databases, Dead-Letter Queue Messages, Error Messages, IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition (FTE), Hang and High CPU, IBM MQ Explorer, IMS, Install and Uninstall, Java and JMS, Performance, Publish/Subscribe, Security, Shared Channels, Shared Queues, Shutdown Problems, Startup Problems, TLS Channels (formerly SSL), Triggering Channels, Triggering Programs.**
- **For General or Unknown Problems:**
  - Refer to "Collect troubleshooting data for a general, or unknown problem in WebSphere MQ for z/OS."

#### 4.3. Related Tasks
- **Collecting Troubleshooting Information on Multiplatforms:** Refer to page 302.

### Collecting Information for Abend Problems on z/OS

#### 5.1. Before You Begin
- **Initial Questions:**
  - What AMS error did you observe on the system?
  - What is the detailed AMS message flow?
  - When did the AMS problem start and stop?
  - Which specific users, applications, and queue manager queues are involved?
  - What IBM MQ security policy is being used, and what files is AMS using?

#### 5.2. Procedure
1. **For Configuration Problems:**
   - Gather RACF listings and CSQ0UTIL lists of policies.
2. **For Server-to-Server Message Channel Agent Interception:**
   - Gather channel definitions and display the output.
3. **For Other Errors and/or Abend Failures:**
   - Collect dumps, job logs, internal traces, and debug traces.
4. **Capture an AMS Trace:**
   - Refer to "Enabling internal trace for the AMSM address space" on page 406.
5. **Capture a GSKit Trace:**
   - Refer to "Using GSKit trace for problems related to certificates and keys when using AMS on z/OS" on page 407.

#### 5.3. Related Tasks
- **Troubleshooting AMS Problems:** Refer to page 67.

### Collecting Information for Shared Queue Problems on z/OS

#### 6.1. Before You Begin
- **Initial Questions:**
  - Name of the shared queue having a problem.
  - Name of the IBM MQ Coupling Facility structure (CFSTRUCT) associated with the problematic shared queue.
  - Message ID associated with the problem.
  - Name of the queue sharing group.
  - Time the problem occurred.
  - Queue manager in the queue sharing group involved.

#### 6.2. Procedure
1. **Generate Traces:**
   - GTF trace, MSTR internal trace, CHIN trace.
2. **Collect Data:**
   - Record software version, release, and maintenance levels.
   - Collect job logs, syslog, z/OS LOGREC report, and z/OS dumps.
   - Collect Coupling Facility Structure dumps.
3. **Send the Collected Information to IBM:**
   - Provide a detailed description of the problem along with the collected data.
   - For FTP and email instructions, see "Exchanging information with IBM Software Support."
   - To open or update a case, visit the IBM My Support site.
   - Always update your case to indicate that data has been sent.
   - For further assistance, contact your country representative or call 1-800-IBM-SERV (in the US).

### Collecting Information for Performance Problems on z/OS

#### 7.1. Before You Begin
- **Initial Questions:**
  - Effect of the problem (e.g., high CPU, response delays).
  - Time the problem first occurred.
  - Whether software or hardware maintenance was applied.
  - Whether the problem is a one-time failure or recurring.
  - Names of the queue managers, queues, channels, or other jobs involved.
  - Review "Troubleshooting MQ performance problems."

#### 7.2. About This Task
- Analyzing performance often requires an Advance Support Offering.
- If the problem can be reproduced or is currently happening, generate data to provide more information.

#### 7.3. Procedure
1. **Generate Data:**
   - GTF trace, MSTR internal trace, CHIN trace.
   - If network performance is in question, generate a z/OS TCP/IP packet trace and an MQ CHIN trace simultaneously at both ends of the channel.
2. **Collect Data:**
   - Record software version, release, and maintenance levels.
   - Collect job logs, syslog, z/OS dump, and z/OS LOGREC report.
3. **Send the Collected Information to IBM:**
   - Provide a detailed description of the problem along with the collected data.
   - For FTP and email instructions, see "Exchanging information with IBM Software Support."
   - To open or update a case, visit the IBM My Support site.
