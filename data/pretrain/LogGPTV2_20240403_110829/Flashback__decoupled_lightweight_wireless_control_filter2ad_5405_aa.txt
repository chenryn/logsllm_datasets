ABSTRACT
Unlike their cellular counterparts, Wi-Fi networks do not have the
luxury of a dedicated control plane that is decoupled from the data
plane. Consequently, Wi-Fi struggles to provide many of the ca-
pabilities that are taken for granted in cellular networks, including
efﬁcient and fair resource allocation, QoS and handoffs. The rea-
son for the lack of a control plane with designated spectrum is that
it would impose signiﬁcant overhead. This is at odds with Wi-Fi’s
goal of providing a simple, plug-and-play network.
In this paper we present Flashback, a novel technique that pro-
vides a decoupled low overhead control plane for wireless networks
that retains the simplicity of Wi-Fi’s distributed asynchronous op-
eration. Flashback allows nodes to reliably send short control mes-
sages concurrently with data transmissions, while ensuring that data
packets are decoded correctly without harming throughput. We
utilize Flashback’s novel messaging capability to design, imple-
ment and experimentally evaluate a reliable control plane for Wi-
Fi with rates from 175Kbps to 400Kbps depending on the envi-
ronment. Moreover, to demonstrate its broad applicability, we de-
sign and implement a novel resource allocation mechanism that uti-
lizes Flashback to provide efﬁcient, QoS-aware and fair medium
access, while eliminating control overheads including data plane
contention, RTS/CTS and random back offs.

INTRODUCTION
Due to their distributed and asynchronous nature, Wi-Fi networks,
unlike cellular networks, function without a dedicated and separate
control plane for node coordination. Wi-Fi uses implicit and ex-
plicit control mechanisms that are always coupled with the data
plane. For example, CSMA’s random back off is a form of im-

plicit coordination between nodes, while RTS/CTS and association
requests are explicit control packets that are multiplexed with data
transmissions. The lack of a separate and decoupled control plane
results in data plane performance problems, and makes it hard to
provide desirable features such as QoS, handoffs, access control
and power duty cycling. For example, random back offs render
packet scheduling inefﬁcient due to collisions and exposed termi-
nals, while explicit control mechanisms such as RTS/CTS consume
signiﬁcant channel time [6, 11, 9, 15].
In contrast, cellular networks have none of these problems, since
they use a separate and decoupled control plane. Cellular networks
(e.g. LTE [13, 8]) designate dedicated spectrum for explicit control
signaling between the base station and clients. Such a decoupled
control plane has many beneﬁts. For example, the base station can
leverage the control plane to centrally schedule user’s data ﬂows,
ensuring both channel efﬁciency (e.g. no collisions or exposed ter-
minals) and the required QoS for trafﬁc classes (voice, video and
data). Several other useful functions, such as client power saving
modes and seamless handoffs, are enabled by the separate con-
trol plane. However, the cellular control plane adds considerable
overhead, because cellular networks have to reserve a signiﬁcant
share of their spectrum for the control channels [13, 8]. Further-
more, since the control channels are accessed using techniques such
as OFDMA, which require microsecond level synchronization [1],
cellular networks have to rely on accurate centralized time synchro-
nization. Wi-Fi’s goal is to be simple, cheap and asynchronous,
and therefore the Wi-Fi standards cannot afford to adopt expensive
and centrally coordinated mechanisms. This raises a natural ques-
tion: Can we achieve similar control functionality in Wi-Fi without
paying the high overhead of cellular networks, while retaining the
simplicity and ﬂexibility of a distributed asynchronous network?
In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Flash-
back, a novel technique that provides Wi-Fi networks with a sepa-

Wi-Fi’s desirable distributed asynchronous nature. The key build-
ing block of Flashback is a novel mechanism that allows nodes to
send short control messages on the same channel concurrently with
data transmissions, without harming the data transmission. More-
over, the control messaging is asynchronous, and does not require
precise clock synchronization among all the nodes. Flashback’s
control messaging adds very little resource overhead since no ex-
tra spectrum or time slots are used, yet as our experiments show,
provides fast and reliable control plane messaging rates of up to
400Kbps, with average rates of 175Kbps. Flashback is general
purpose and can be used for a wide gamut of applications, from
centralized resource allocation to handoffs and network association.
How can nodes send short control messages concurrently with
data transmissions without causing harm to the data? The key in-
sight is to use short high-powered ﬂashes that are localized in fre-
quency and time, which only interfere with a very small number of
symbols from the data transmission. When the data receiver detects
these ﬂashes, it simply erases the bits that were corrupted from the
bits of the data packet. Flashback uses the location of the ﬂashes
as a way to modulate bits that represent the control message. To
make this clearer, consider the scenario, where a client is transmit-
ting a data packet to the AP using Wi-Fi OFDM. The packet can be
visualized as a two-dimensional grid of time and frequency slots,
with dimensions equal to the length of the packet and the number
of OFDM subcarriers respectively, as depicted by the second pic-
ture in Fig. 1. Another client concurrently transmits short ﬂashes
that are localized to one of the slots in the time-frequency grid. As
Fig. 1 shows, the ﬂash is overlaid on top of one of the subcarriers
in the received data packet. In practice, ﬂashing is equivalent to
sending a sinusoid that has a time length equal to that of a Wi-Fi
OFDM symbol (4µs), at a frequency equal to the speciﬁc subcar-
rier on which the ﬂash is sent. The client can transform a series of
ﬂashes into a small control message (32 bits) by varying the rela-
tive location of ﬂashes. The AP can then read the client’s message,
by detecting the time-frequency slots in which it sees high-powered
ﬂashes and transforming them back to the control message.
Flashback exploits two unique properties of OFDM signaling to
ensure that data transmissions do not fail due to interference from
ﬂashes. First, OFDM divides data into small chunks that are modu-
lated separately on each time-frequency slot. By ﬂashing a small
number of speciﬁc time-frequency slots, Flashback ensures that
any interference is localized and does not corrupt the entire packet.
Second, successful packet transmissions invariably have some link
margin, i.e. the SNR of the received packet is typically greater than
the minimum SNR needed to decode the packet. Due to this mar-
gin, the loss of a few data bits does not affect decoding: the receiver
can simply erase the bits from the slots where the ﬂash was sent and
recover the data from the other symbols.
We design and implement Flashback on a Virtex-5 based FPGA
software radio test bed, including a full implementation of a 20M Hz
Wi-Fi OFDM receiver and transmitter with convolutional coding.
Flashback is implemented by applying minimal ﬁrmware modiﬁca-
tions to the OFDM PHY receive and transmit chains. Our exper-
imental evaluations show that Flashback supports typical control
message rate of about 175Kbps and a maximum rate of 400Kbps
(depending on the environment), while causing minimal impact to
concurrent data packets (less than 0.5% overhead).
In addition,
Flashback’s ﬂash detection can be conﬁgured so that it rarely misses
a ﬂash (less than 1% false negative rate) under almost all channel
conditions, ensuring that control messages are received reliably.
The main contribution of Flashback is to exploit its ﬂashing capa-
bility to create a novel control plane for asynchronous wireless net-
works that is decoupled from the data plane. Such a control plane
can be used for a variety of network control functions. First, we
show how Flashback can facilitate efﬁcient, high throughput and
QoS-aware medium access. We then demonstrate that Flashback
can be used to design a virtual wireless enterprise network that pro-
vides seamless association, ﬂow setup, teardown and scheduling.
Finally, we show how Flashback can be used by Wi-Fi clients to
efﬁciently duty cycle.
In order to evaluate these applications we ran trace-driven sim-
ulations under several network scenarios. Our simulation results
show that Flashback can outperform the traditional Wi-Fi MAC
protocols signiﬁcantly, providing a throughput increase of more
than 5× over CSMA/CA and 1.8× over RTS/CTS in congested
networks, and 70% energy savings compared to Wi-Fi Power Sav-
ing Mode (PSM). Furthermore, Flashback can be used to easily en-
force QoS policies. Using Flashback, latency-sensitive trafﬁc (e.g.
VoIP) would experience less than 1ms of delay even under highly
congested networks.
2. OVERVIEW
This section provides an overview of Flashback. We ﬁrst de-
scribe the general motivation for our control channel design. We
then provide a short primer on OFDM wireless PHY and SNR
link margins, which are fundamental for understanding Flashback’s
control messaging mechanism. We ﬁnally describe an overview of
Flashback’s design.
2.1 Motivation: Control Plane On Top of the
Data Plane
Before we start describing Flashback’s design, we would like to
answer a simple question: Why does our control plane send ﬂashes
on top of concurrent data transmissions? Can’t we implement a
control plane similar to cellular networks, where spectrum is pre-
allocated for a dedicated control channel?
The main reason is that spectrum is becoming scarce in the un-
licensed band, especially due to the proliferation of dense wire-
less deployments. Speciﬁcally, if we were to pre-allocate a narrow
2M hz chunk for a control channel, according to Wi-Fi speciﬁca-
tions, we would need to reserve an additional 1.875M Hz as guard
band [12]). Consequently, in a 20M Hz channel, almost 25% of the
spectrum would be consumed by the control channel. In contrast,
by sending control messages on top of the data plane spectrum,
Flashback does not consume any extra spectrum.
Alternatively, we could use a protocol like OFDMA, which lets
multiple nodes transmit data and control packets on different fre-
quencies at the same time, without requiring extra spectrum [1].
However, OFDM requires tight synchronization (on the order of a
microsecond) among all client nodes. Wi-Fi’s current protocols do
not support such tight time synchronization. In contrast to OFDMA,
our scheme does not require any clock synchronization.
Finally, messages such as RTS and CTS packets, beacons and
probes are all designed to implement control functions. However,
these messages occupy the network time of the data packets. Fur-
thermore, since these messages have to be delivered reliably, they
are encoded using the lowest bitrates and consume signiﬁcant por-
tions of the channel time. As our own simulations and recent studies
have shown [7], such messages can consume up to 40-50% of the
channel’s time. In addition, this overhead makes it hard for QoS
standards like 802.11e [14] to enforce QoS requirements in con-
gested networks, because they multiplex their control messages on
the data plane. As a result of the extra overhead, many network
managers prefer to disable most of these control functions.

2.2 OFDM Primer
OFDM is a multi-carrier wideband modulation technique. OFDM
divides the entire bandwidth available for transmission into evenly
spaced orthogonal bands, which are called subcarriers. The data is
split into parallel streams, one for each subcarrier. Speciﬁcally, in
Wi-Fi, a 20MHz channel is split into 64 subcarriers, each spaced
312.5KHz apart.
To modulate data onto OFDM transmissions, a single constella-
tion symbol is sent on each subcarrier of an OFDM symbol, de-
pending on the bitrate being used (BPSK, QPSK, etc.). The con-
stellation symbols are passed through an IFFT to produce time do-
