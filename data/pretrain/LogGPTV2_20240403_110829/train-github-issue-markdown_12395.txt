Since 2.1.0, Button dropdown menu items cannot be clicked/selected on iPhone
(Unable to test on other touch devices to confirm). The dropdown menu closes
as soon as you try to click an item from the dropdown.
This issue is repeatable on the Bootstrap Sample Page:

To clarify, I also applied the 4497 fix to see if that helped, and no luck:
