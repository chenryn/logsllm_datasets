When attempting to debug my program in Qt Creator, I encounter the following output in the "Application Output" pane:

```
Debugging starts
  Debugging has failed
  Debugging has finished
```

Alternatively, the process sometimes freezes after:

```
Debugging starts
```

Previously, I was able to run the debugger without any issues. Is there a way to fix this or to diagnose the problem?

**Environment:**
- Qt Creator: 3.5.1
- GCC: 4.8.5
- GDB: 7.9.1
- Python: 2.7.9

**Additional Information:**
- The issue does not occur if the "Run in terminal" option is unchecked.
- Changing the terminal from `konsole` back to `xterm` also resolves the issue. (It previously worked with `konsole`, which is odd.)

Any suggestions on how to resolve or further investigate this problem would be greatly appreciated.
