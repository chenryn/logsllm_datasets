User: See that when trying to debug my program in Qt Creator "Application Output" pane:

Debugging starts
  Debugging has failed
  Debugging has finished

Or freezes after

Debugging starts  

Was able to run previously. Any way to fix this or to discover the problem?
Qt Creator 3.5.1, gcc 4.8.5, gdb 7.9.1, Python 2.7.9
P.S. Hmm, works fine if "Run in terminal" unchecked or terminal changed back from konsole to xterm (works in konsole previously - weird).
