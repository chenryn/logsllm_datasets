For example, I have a playbook named remotesetup.yml and I run it from the
command line like that:
ansible-playbook remotesetupp.yml -K
It will ask for the sudo password even if the file doesn't exist (I made a
typo, two p at the end).  
In the same way, if there's a yaml syntax error in the playbook it will still
ask me for the sudo pass even though it can't run the playbook.
Thus, the parsing of the playbook should be done prior to asking for sudo or
ssh pass.
