mates the goal of only plausibly detecting target videos with
high self similarity.
The remaining 15 movies were divided into random sets of
10 training movies and 5 target movies, and for each train-
ing/target combination we evaluated matching performance
using our thresholding method (Section 9.3) which rejected
queries unless there was a .05 gap in the cross-correlation
of the best candidate match and the runner up. For each
combination of training and target movie sets we computed
matching using a database of neural network EMI (generated
for the 5 target movies) and queried using real TV EMI (from
10 test movies — the 5 target movies with generated EMI
via the neural network and the 5 movies originally excluded
due to low self similarity). The average cross correlation
of the neural network output and the ground truth EMI of
the Panasonic-42-A for the 5 target movies was .88 (for a
query length of 60 minutes). Figure 9 shows the results of
submitting real EMI for the 5 target movies into our query
matching system (the hit rate at 60 minutes is .74, lower than
.88, because of the .05 threshold gap). Figure 10 visually
shows the alignment between the generated EMI for a target
movie and real EMI for that movie. The matching database
correctly rejected EMI from the ﬁve movies originally ex-
cluded because of low self similarity with average probability
96.8 (averaged across query lengths longer than 15 minutes).
Using brightness as an isolated input to train a network
generates signals that are .73 correlated with real EMI for
the target movies (other features produce an average of .17
correlation). In future work it would be worthwhile to use
hypothesis driven regression models to strengthen our under-
standing of generative EMI sources, however such analysis
will require careful experimentation with secondary sources
of EMI signal modulation (e.g., display processing circuitry)
ˆa as suggested by our results and conﬁrmed by [18].
It is important to stress that the above analysis should
only be viewed as evidence of plausibility — the primary
focus of our work is on the experimental analysis of real EMI
as discussed in the previous sections. Our results here do,
however, suggest that it is feasible to use supervised methods
to train generative models of EMI.

cause problems with legitimate powerline-based communica-
tion systems like broadband over powerline and X10(r) home
automated systems. A more practical approach could be to
identify potential devices that may be leaking information by
observing the power line and only blocking certain frequency
bands using an active noise rejection system or informing the
home owner where to install line isolators.
It might be tempting to fall back on an out-of-band solution
and ask for new regulation on how SMPS power supplies are
built. In addition the political challenges with such a solution,
this approach is also faced with the following tension:
it
may be impossible to fully defend against such information
disclosure while still being in compliance with Energy STAR.
Said another way, existing regulation within the U.S. may
make it diﬃcult or infeasible to implement defenses since
the costs of privacy (increased consumption and decreased
eﬃciency) are in direct conﬂict with recent legislation. This
creates a fundamental challenge: to develop systems that are
both highly energy eﬃcient and private.
Through this contribution we assess the key features of
SMPS information leakage over the powerline, and provide
a knowledge base to aid in future eﬀorts for mitigating the
tension between device functionality and privacy.

We conducted an extensive study of powerline information
leakage from eight modern TVs spanning two technologies
(LCD, Plasma), three sizes (32
), and three manu-
facturers (Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp). We ﬁnd that these
TVs generally produce stable, robust EMI signals on the
powerline that correlate with the video being displayed. We
discuss two adversarial goals that do not require an adversary
to pre-train on the set of all possible movies, but rather train
on a small set of video content/movies (e.g., to infer whether
a person is watching a target, sensitive video or whether a per-
son is watching a target, sensitive channel), and we describe
two diﬀerent classes of adversaries (intentional adversaries
that might attach malicious hardware to a home’s powerline
and unintentional adversaries — e.g., ubicomp devices — that
might unwittingly collect and storing privacy-compromising
measurements from the home’s powerline). Next, we exper-
imentally evaluate our approach with 20 movies in both a
clean laboratory setting and electrically noisy home environ-
ments with other active devices connected to the powerline.
Subsequently, we describe extensions to our core work that
allow an attacker to infer information from a home’s TV’s
EMI without ever requiring access to that TV or another
TV of the same model (by dynamically learning a model
of the TV’s EMI signatures as a function of known video
content). Lastly, we close with a discussion of some defenses,
as well as fundamental challenges to fully defending against
this threat (e.g., complete defenses may be in violation of
Energy STAR).

11. DISCUSSION
Applicability to Other Devices.
To better understand
the scope of information leakage exposed via conducted EMI
from SMPS, we executed a survey of other common home
electronics: a personal computer, a laptop, a laser printer, a
DVD player, a game console, and a washing machine. Our
aim was to assess whether these SMPS-based appliances sim-
ilarly produce noise signatures as a function of their device
operation. Recall that past work on conducted EMI infor-
mation leakage, such as works focused on keyboards [3, 28],
observed EMI that was a direct function of electrical signals —
bits — already communicated within the device in question;
SMPS were not designed to carry digital signals, yet we ob-
served that many appliances do yield EMI signal ﬂuctuations
that are correlated with the various functions supported by
the device in question.
We found that the laser printer generated increased elec-
tromagnetic interference while warming up and during the
printing process that engages the motors. In the case of the
personal computer and laptop, we observed increases in EMI
amplitude while running a collection of intensive CPU/mem-
ory/disk benchmarks. The DVD player’s (with internal FM
Radio) EMI was aﬀected by volume changes, and the game
console produced diﬀerent EMI signals depending on whether
it was in the main menu or in the process of rendering a
game. The washer produced EMI bursts whenever the barrel
rotated during the wash cycle.
Defenses and Challenges. There are several potential
countermeasures for minimizing information leakage through
EMI. One simple defense mechanism is to connect SMPS
based devices to a powerline isolator similar to the one used
in our laboratory experiments. The internal transformer
provides enough isolation such that the high frequency noise
does not pass back over the powerline (assuming the isolator
itself has not been compromised). This capability is found
in some newer line conditioners and in some instances of
uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs).
A potential whole home solution, which does not require
installing a device behind every electronic appliance, would
be to inject random high-energy broadband noise over the
powerline. In addition to traditional challenges with random-
ness, a key pragmatic challenge with this approach is that it

the reject rate. Rather, the accept rate (not shown) is 1
minus the reject rate. The hit rate is the number of correct
matches divided by the number of queries not rejected. The
reject rate gets higher as we require a larger gap between the
winner and the runner up. The accept rate (not shown) will
simultaneously decrease. However, the hit rate (shown) does
increase with larger threshold values. For our experiments
we select a threshold of .05, which yields a hit rate.

A. TWO EMI TYPES
EMI signal ﬂuctuations can be manifested as frequency
shifts or variations in energy density. The following ﬁgure
shows examples of these two types of EMI signals.
The Sharp-42 TV is shown on the left; changes in screen
content cause a shift in the center frequency of the EMI. The
white strip on left shows the signal obtained by tracking the
EMI on left. The Panasonic-42-A TV is shown on the right;
changes on screen manifest as change in the Energy density
of the EMI. Tracking total energy over time yields the signal
shown in white strip on the right.
B. REDUCING FALSE MATCHES USING A
CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD
The following ﬁgure shows average hit rates (solid lines)
and reject rates (dashed lines) as a function of threshold
setting for conﬁdence gap between the top match and the
runner-up for 6 minute queries. The blue lines represent the
average hit and reject rates for the 6 TVs (excluding the
Sharp 32” A&B); and the red lines depict the average hit
and reject rates for the Sharp 32” A&B. Note that the Sharp
TVs produce signiﬁcantly higher reject rates because they
produce signals that are not good at discriminating between
movies.
