User: How to encrypt your company's WiFi network and ensure access control and security?
Assistant: 1. Determine the password strength: Set the password to include symbols, numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters. The password should contain at least 12 characters and should not be repeated with other accounts. 2. Update network equipment: Keep network equipment firmware/software up to date to ensure bugs and security holes are fixed. Also make sure that routers, switches, and firewalls are properly configured and that all unused ports and services are closed. 3. Network Segmentation: Segment the network to place important data and devices in a separate network that should be extra protected. This restricts access to protected data. 4. Use WPA2 encryption: WPA2 is a secure encryption protocol that can be used to protect WiFi networks from unwanted access. AES encryption is also a good option. 5. Forbid SSID broadcasting: Disable SSID broadcasting to prevent unauthorized personnel from finding the network and attacking it. 6. Enable MAC address filtering: Enable MAC address filtering to ensure that only devices in the authorized list can access the network. Each device's unique MAC address is a device identity identifier. 7. Mandatory sharing of passwords: Mandatory sharing of passwords, such as printing passwords at company entrances, allows authorized users to access the network. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing the network. 8. Enable network logging: Enable network logging so that you can track all operations on your network and take swift action if threats are found. 9. Train employees: Company employees should receive cybersecurity training on best practices regarding WiFi network security. This helps employees avoid spreading viruses through the network and ensures network stability and reliability.
