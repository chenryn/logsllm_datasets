##### Description of the problem
#12458 "Fix FileLoader duplicate request issues" seems to have introduced a
new problem. When the same file is loaded with high frequency and ArrayBuffers
are used then this message is likely to appear:
    Uncaught DOMException ... ArrayBuffer at index 0 is already neutered.
You can reproduce this easily with example `webgl_loader_obj2_run_director`.
Select a high worker count; minimum 4 better 8 or 12. Watch the log for the
appearance of the error. Due to the DOMException the worker feed gets stalled.
When I revert to r87 the issue is gone. I have a potential fix, but I am not
100% sure why it works:  
https://github.com/kaisalmen/three.js/blob/FileLoaderRegression/src/loaders/FileLoader.js
I made `loading` a member of `FileLoader` and I think due to the now existing
dependency memory of the two objects is no longer released independently.
@takahirox do you mind have a look?
