## The Problem
When a user visits an HTTP page that contains an HTTPS logon button, a malicious proxy can intercept and alter the traffic, changing the HTTPS request to HTTP. This makes the user's login credentials vulnerable to interception.

### Target
- **Example Site:** Facebook
- **Attacker Role:** Evil Proxy in the Middle

### Traffic Flow
- **Client** → **HTTP** → **Evil Proxy** → **HTTPS** → **Internet**

## Methods to Insert into the Middle
1. **Physical Insertion in a Wired Network**
   - **Configuration:**
     - **Target** → **Attacker** → **Internet**
   
2. **Configuring Proxy Server in the Browser**
   - Manually setting the browser to use a specific proxy server.
   
3. **ARP Poisoning**
   - **Description:** ARP poisoning redirects traffic at Layer 2 by sending false ARP packets on the LAN.
   - **Detection:** Can be easily detected.
   - **Tool:** DeCaffienateID by IronGeek
   - **Resource:** [http://k78.sl.pt](http://k78.sl.pt)

### ARP Request and Reply
- **Scenario:**
  - **Client** wants to find the **Gateway**.
  - **ARP Request:** "Who has 192.168.2.1?"
  - **ARP Reply:** "MAC: 00-30-bd-02-ed-7b has 192.168.2.1"

### ARP Poisoning Example
- **Client** → **ARP Request** → **Gateway**
- **Attacker** → **ARP Reply:** "I am the Gateway"
- **Traffic to Facebook** → **Forwarded & Altered Traffic**
