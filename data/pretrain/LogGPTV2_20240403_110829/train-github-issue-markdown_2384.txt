 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8.7
**Issue**
I am developing with Rails and I want to use Typescript to compile to
Javascript. In IntelliJ IDEA I have enabled the compilation of Typescript to
Javascript.  
The files are properly compiled with both `SourceName.ts`, `SourceName.js` and
`SourceName.js.map` files generated. However, when I access the `.ts` file in
Chrome debugger, the source code I see is the compiled Javascript, not
typescript.
I've tried putting them in separate folders and it still doesn't work. Only
thing that works is building inline sourcemaps in the compiler, but that
produces weirdly named files in the root structure of the project.
EDIT: SourceMaps are properly compiled, the `.ts` file shows in the Chrome
file tree, but has the same content as the .js file
EDIT 2: I've tried compiling using the npm package `typescript`. I created a
test file called `Testing.ts` and used it to demonstrate the problem:
    class Testing{
        public static MakeWarn(){
            console.log("abc");
        }
    }
I ran `tsc Testing.ts --sourceMap` which generated two files
  * `Testing.js`
  * `Testing.js.map`
The contents are as follows:
Testing.js
    var Testing = (function () {
        function Testing() {
        }
        Testing.MakeWarn = function () {
            console.log("abc");
        };
        return Testing;
    }());
    //# sourceMappingURL=Testing.js.map
Testing.js.map
    {"version":3,"file":"Testing.js","sourceRoot":"","sources":["Testing.ts"],"names":[],"mappings":"AAAA;IAAA;IAIA,CAAC;IAHiB,gBAAQ,GAAtB;QACI,OAAO,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,KAAK,CAAC,CAAC;IACvB,CAAC;IACL,cAAC;AAAD,CAAC,AAJD,IAIC"}
To my knowledge, these are properly defined `.js` and `.js.map` files.
When I open the link in Chrome, I get `Testing.self.js` and `Testing.ts` files
which both have contents
    var Testing = (function () {
        function Testing() {
        }
        Testing.MakeWarn = function () {
            console.log("abc");
        };
        return Testing;
    }());
    //# sourceMappingURL=Testing.js.map
This is not the expected behaviour. To my understanding, `.ts` file should
look like the original source in Chrome debugger. And I should be able to put
a breakpoint.
**Expected behavior:**
Should have different files for .ts and .js
**Actual behavior:**
In Chrome and Firefox Developer Edition has the same files for .ts and .js
