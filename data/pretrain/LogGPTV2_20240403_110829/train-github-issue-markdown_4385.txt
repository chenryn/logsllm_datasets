I'm looking into customizing an installation of Bootstrap 2 for my color
scheme, and the names are virtually worthless. My scheme is light-on-dark, and
the default text color variable name is "gray". I can set this to white and it
will work, but it's completely counter-intuitive.
Variable names shouldn't be names of colors, unless you're defining those
colors. For example, defining your particular shade of gray in "gray" so you
can use it is fine, but then doing "color: @gray" is bad design.
I understand that it's rather a big change, but it would be much better if it
were something like:
    @gray: #333;
    @textColor: @gray;
    body { color: @textColor; }
This way is used in most places, but there are some places that use the color-
named variables directly. Ideally, this shouldn't happen anywhere outside
variables.less.
