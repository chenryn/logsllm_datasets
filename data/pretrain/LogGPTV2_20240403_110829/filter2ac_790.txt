### ATT&CK Technique Name: Software Configuration

To enhance email security and prevent spoofing, implement anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms. These include:

- **Sender Policy Framework (SPF):** This mechanism verifies the sender's domain by checking if the sending mail server is authorized to send emails on behalf of that domain.
- **DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM):** This ensures the integrity of the email by verifying that the message has not been altered in transit.

By enabling these mechanisms within your organization, you can also leverage policies such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC). DMARC allows both internal and external recipients to perform similar message filtering and validation, thereby reducing the risk of phishing and other email-based attacks.

Additionally, consider implementing the following measures to further enhance security:

- **Browser Extensions:** Enforce or install browser extensions that protect against Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) and homograph attacks. These extensions help detect and block deceptive URLs that mimic legitimate domains.
- **Browser Password Managers:** Configure browser password managers to only auto-fill credentials when the URL exactly matches that of the original, legitimate site. This helps prevent users from inadvertently entering their credentials on fraudulent websites.

By combining these strategies, you can significantly improve the security of your organizationâ€™s email and web browsing activities.
