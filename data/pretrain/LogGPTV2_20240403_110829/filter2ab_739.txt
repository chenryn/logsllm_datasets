### Title: Black Hat USA 2018 - Another Flip in the Row

**Abstract:**

The Rowhammer bug is a critical issue affecting most DRAM modules, allowing software to induce bit flips in DRAM cells, thereby manipulating data. While DRAM vendors initially considered it a reliability concern, research has demonstrated that a single bit flip can compromise the security of an entire computer system.

In this talk, we will provide an overview of the developments surrounding Rowhammer since its initial presentation at Black Hat USA 2015. We will discuss the various attacks and defenses that researchers have developed. Defenses against Rowhammer typically aim to either prevent the Rowhammer effect entirely or ensure that attackers cannot exploit the bug.

We will present a novel Rowhammer attack that challenges existing assumptions about the requirements for such attacks. Specifically, our "one-location hammering" technique demonstrates that Rowhammer does not necessarily require alternating access to multiple addresses. We will explain how modern CPUs' reliance on memory-controller policies enables this new hammering method. Additionally, we will introduce new techniques for exploiting Rowhammer-like bit flips, which bypass all currently proposed countermeasures.

Beyond traditional privilege escalation attacks, we will also demonstrate a new, easily mountable denial-of-service (DoS) attack that can be exploited in cloud environments. Our findings highlight that, despite significant efforts, the Rowhammer bug remains unmitigated.

We conclude that further research is essential to fully understand this vulnerability and to develop effective and secure countermeasures.
