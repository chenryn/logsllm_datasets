User: How should the shebang for a Python script look like?
Some people support #!/usr/bin/env python because it can find the Python interpreter intelligently. Others support #!/usr/bin/python, because now in most GNU/Linux distributions python is the default program.
What are the benefits of the two variants?
Assistant: I use #!/usr/bin/env python as the default install location on OS-X is NOT /usr/bin.  This also applies to users who like to customize their environment -- /usr/local/bin is another common place where you might find a python distribution.
That said, it really doesn't matter too much.  You can always test the script with whatever python version you want:  /usr/bin/strange/path/python myscript.py.   Also, when you install a script via setuptools, the shebang seems to get replaced by the sys.executable which installed that script -- I don't know about pip, but I would assume it behaves similarly.
