Question: "You are reviewing the security of a web application which dynamically constructs web pages based on user input. The application currently does not specify an encoding in HTTP headers, potentially allowing browsers to guess the encoding and opening up to XSS attacks. Given this scenario, which of the following strategies would be effective for mitigating these security risks?"
 "A": "Implementing an 'accept known good' input validation strategy that rejects or transforms input not strictly conforming to specifications."
 "B": "Setting the session cookie to be HttpOnly to prevent the session cookie from being accessible via client-side scripts."
 "C": "Configuring the application firewall to detect attacks against this weakness."
 "D": "Creating a mapping from a set of fixed input values to actual filenames or URLs, and rejecting all other inputs."
Answer: ABCD
