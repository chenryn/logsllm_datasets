## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
    >>> import platform
    >>> import pkg_resources
    >>>
    >>> your_python_requires_str = ">=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*, !=3.4.*,"
    >>> pkg_resources.Requirement.parse("python_version%s" % your_python_requires_str)
    .....
    pkg_resources.RequirementParseError: Invalid requirement, parse error at "','"
    >>>
    >>> valid_python_requires_str = your_python_requires_str.rstrip(',')
    >>> pkg_resources.Requirement.parse("python_version%s" % valid_python_requires_str)
    Requirement.parse('python_version!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*,!=3.4.*,>=2.7')
# Expected Behavior
`python_requires` string should be a valid python version specifier.  
The same applies to the `requires_python` attribute on pypi.org
# Actual Behavior
`pkg_resources.Requirement.parse` raises an Exception with the current
provided string
