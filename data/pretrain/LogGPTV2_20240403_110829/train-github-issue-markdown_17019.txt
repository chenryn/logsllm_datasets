Hello Team,

After updating from Symfony 3.4.3 to 3.4.4, we observed a significant (approximately 10x) increase in memory usage when running our test suite. To investigate this issue, we profiled the execution of both versions using Blackfire. The results are available at the following links:

- **Symfony 3.4.4:**
  - [Blackfire Profile](https://blackfire.io/profiles/22ed34e8-9827-48ef-8ed4-7eaf9a6218c5/graph)

- **Symfony 3.4.3:**
  - [Blackfire Profile](https://blackfire.io/profiles/eacbfc2d-6592-4003-9d16-6c967286d36e/graph)

Upon analyzing the profiles, we suspected that the changes introduced in PR #25835 might be the cause. To confirm this, we reverted the changes and ran the tests again. The memory consumption decreased significantly, as shown in the following Blackfire profile:

- **Symfony 3.4.4 with Reverted #25835:**
  - [Blackfire Profile](https://blackfire.io/profiles/df3e9f4a-d28c-4a4e-8cf9-ea48a1659328/graph)

For your convenience, here are the direct comparisons between the different runs:

- **Comparison: Symfony 3.4.3 vs. Symfony 3.4.4**
- **Comparison: Symfony 3.4.4 vs. Symfony 3.4.4 with Reverted #25835**

The cache was cleared before each run to ensure consistent results.

If you require any additional information, please let me know. Unfortunately, I am unable to share the codebase.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
