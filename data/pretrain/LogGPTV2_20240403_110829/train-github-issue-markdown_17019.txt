Symfony version | 3.4.4  
Hello guys,
after updating from 3.4.3 to 3.4.4 we noticed a 10x increase in memory usage
when running our testsuite. To analyze the issue, we profiled both execution
(3.4.3 and 3.4.4) with blackfire (see links below). Looking at the comparison
of both runs we had the idea to revert #25835. Running blackfire again shows a
decreased memory consumption.
The cache was cleared prior to each run.
If you need further information let me know. Unfortunately I can not share the
code base.
3.4.4:
