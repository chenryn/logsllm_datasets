k=1 C(k) forms a Golomb ruler, i.e. a set of integers such that distances between pairs of
integers in the set are pairwise distinct. From this perspective our model predicts that throwing R balls
uniformly at random into N bins generates a Golomb ruler for R = Ω(N 6).
In the next sections we make further use of our analytical model to compute relevant quantities in
the graph from our main reconstruction algorithm, namely the number of vertices and edges.
C.2 Number of Vertices in the Graph
We now consider the graph from our main attack in Section 3. We say that an integer is a volume iﬀ
it is the volume of some range, i.e. the number of records whose value lies within that range (we also
say that the records are matched by the range).
Recall that the number of vertices in the graph is the number of complemented volumes: that
is, the number of volumes v such that R − v is also a volume. There are 2(N − 1) volumes that
are automatically complemented, namely those arising from ranges [1, 1], [1, 2], . . . , [1, N − 1] and their
complements [2, N ], . . . , [N, N ].
Indeed the volumes of these ranges form the clique that our main
algorithm seeks. We now set out to estimate the number of volumes v that are complemented by
accident, i.e. not because the complement of the queried range is also a range as previously, but because
R − v happens to collide with the volume of some other range.
If we disregard ranges that are automatically complemented, the number of ranges of length d is
N − 1 − d. Each one of these ranges is complemented by accident iﬀ the number of records matched
by the complement of the range collides with the volume of a range. Note that the number of records
R− v in the complement of a range of length d follows the same distribution as the number of records in
a range of length N − d: indeed, as far as the number of records matched by some values is concerned,
only the number of values matters, not the fact that they form a range. It follows per Equation (1)
that the probability that R − v collides with a given range of length N − d can be approximated by:
(cid:112)

πR(N − d)/N
.
Since there are d + 1 ranges of length N − d, it follows that the probability that a range of length d
is complemented by accident is close to d + 1 times the previous value. Since there are N − 1− d ranges
of length d that are not automatically complemented, we get that the number of ranges complemented
by accident can be estimated by

Taking into account the 2(N − 1) ≈ 2N volumes that are automatically complemented, we deduce
that the total number of complemented volumes, and hence the number of vertices in the graph, can
be approximated by:

C.3 Number of Edges in the Graph
Recall that two vertices in the graph share an edge iﬀ the (absolute value of) the diﬀerence of the
corresponding volumes is itself a volume. Since the graph contains two cliques arising from initial
segment ranges [1, 1], [1, 2], . . . , [1, N ] and their complements, it must contain (approximately) N 2 edges
arising from these two cliques. Moreover it also contains edges that occur by accident, in the sense
that the diﬀerence in volumes is a volume not because the set diﬀerence of the two ranges is itself a
range, but because it happens to collide with the volume of some range. We now set out to estimate
the number of such accidental edges.
For a given range of length d, the analysis from Appendix C.2 shows that the number of comple-
mented volumes (i.e. vertices) arising from ranges of length d can be approximated by:

Following the same line of reasoning as in the previous section, the diﬀerence between the volumes of
two ranges of length d1 and d2 is going to accidentally match the volume of some range of length |d2−d1|
with probability close to:
As a result of the previous observations, the number of accidental edges may be approximated by:

In the previous section, we have seen that the number of vertices can be approximated as O(N 3/

estimated to O(N/
Indeed our clique-ﬁnding algorithm succeeds as long as the initial range segments [1, 1], [1, 2], . . . , [1, N ]
and their complements induce the only two N -cliques in the graph. Heuristically, other cliques of size
N or greater will only exist if the edge density is close to 1.
To substantiate this, if we were to model our graph as a random graph as far as its clique number is
concerned (and disregarding the two N -cliques that necessarily exist), the clique number of a random
graph with n vertices and edge density p is Θ(− log n/ log p) [Bol98]; since the number of vertices is
polynomial in N , having the clique number grow above N would thus require that the edge density
should be 1 − O(log N/N ), i.e. very close to 1. On the other hand, by our previous estimate, the edge
