The following example explodes in memory usage when calling the jitted
functions. The culprit seems to be the dynamic_slice. It happens calling with
or without the GPU.
Incidentally, it is also rather slow (twice slower than the plain Python
version), so I welcome comments if there is a jax-friendlier way to rewrite
it, but perhaps that is what jit should do?
My system:
Fedora 29, 31 GB RAM  
jax 0.1.36  
jaxlib 0.1.16, installed from the googleapis wheel.  
CUDA 10.0  
Nvidia driver 430.14.
