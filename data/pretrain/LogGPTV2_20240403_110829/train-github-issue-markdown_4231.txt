The following example exhibits a significant increase in memory usage when invoking the JIT-compiled functions. The issue appears to be related to the `dynamic_slice` operation. This problem occurs both with and without GPU acceleration.

Additionally, the performance is notably slowerâ€”approximately twice as slow as the equivalent plain Python version. I am open to suggestions for a more JAX-friendly way to rewrite this code, although one might expect the JIT compiler to handle such optimizations.

System Specifications:
- Fedora 29
- 31 GB RAM
- JAX 0.1.36
- JAXlib 0.1.16 (installed from the Google APIs wheel)
- CUDA 10.0
- NVIDIA Driver 430.14
