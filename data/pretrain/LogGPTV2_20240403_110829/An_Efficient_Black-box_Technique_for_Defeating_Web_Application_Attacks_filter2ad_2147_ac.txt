We define an alternative distance measure, denoted as \( ED^\# \), to address the limitations of the existing edit distance (ED) in specific contexts. The new measure is defined as follows:

\[
ED^\#(u, v) = \min(D(U - V), I(V - U))
\]

The rationale for using the minimum value is based on the need to minimize the number of substrings considered by the filtering technique. We limit our consideration to n-length substrings of \( t \). Due to this constraint, it may initially appear that a large number of insertion or deletion operations are required to transform \( s \) into \( u \). However, the closest match \( v \) found by the edit-distance algorithm could be a substring of \( u \), or \( u \) could be a substring of \( v \).

- If \( v \) is a substring of \( u \), then the insertion operations might not be necessary.
- Conversely, if \( u \) is a substring of \( v \), then the deletion operations might not be needed.

Since we cannot predict which scenario will apply, we take the minimum of the deletion and insertion costs as an upper bound for the edit distance. By substituting \( ED' \) with \( ED^\# \), we achieve a more accurate and efficient coarse-filtering algorithm.

**Theorem 2 (Soundness of Filtering Technique):** If there exists a substring \( u = t_i t_{i+1} \cdots t_j \) of \( t \) such that \( ED(s, u) \leq d \), then \( ED^\#(s, t_i) \leq d \) and \( ED^\#(s, t_k) \leq d \) for all \( i \leq k \leq j \).

This theorem ensures that the coarse-filtering technique will identify all approximate substring matches between \( s \) and \( t \) within the distance threshold \( d \). Additionally, as shown in Figure 4, setting a threshold lower than \( ED^\# \) can result in missing some matches. These results collectively indicate that \( ED^\# \) provides a precise characterization of all instances where the dynamic programming algorithm needs to be applied.

### Taint Inference and Pruning Policies

Taint inference, which is based on edit distance, should also use the same thresholds for pruning policies. For very small strings, the threshold is automatically set to zero, meaning an exact match is used. This approach ensures consistency and accuracy in the taint analysis process.
