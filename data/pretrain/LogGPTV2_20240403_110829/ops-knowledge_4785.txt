User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Installing testlink on Amazon EC2 instance I have created an Amazon EC2 instance to host a testlink server with RHEL. I have successfully configured mysql client, Apache and PHP, but when I try to install it and create the DB, I'm unable to reach my RDS instance that will be used to host this Database. I also tried creating the DB manually, but when trying to log in I'm still unable to reach the RDS instance with the following error: "Connect to database testlink on Host xxxxxxx fails 
DBMS Error Message: 2003 - Can't connect to MySQL server on 'xxxxxxxxxxx' (13) "

Can anyone help me with this problem?

You might not not added your web server IP to the security group in RDS.
You might have set the publicly accessible option to NO and in that case you can only access the RDS if your web servers are in the same VPC.
