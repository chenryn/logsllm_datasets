I'm beginning to use TypeScript to replace JS in my VS2015 projects, but I
can't seem to figure out what is happening in a React project. I converted the
JSX to TSX without any problems, but when I try to edit the 'render' method it
seems as if Intellisense is not able to parse the HTML:
![tsx1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6384219/10410764/dd2d7df0-6f21-11e5-8475-887b6b689741.png)  
(VS correctly identifies the beginning `''`)
But when I try to type the closing `''`, Intellisense does not show the
correct option:  
![tsx2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6384219/10410791/a4c78a7c-6f22-11e5-93ad-8676ce32a8b4.png)
Am I missing something? If I "force" the editor to produce the correct HTML it
compiles without errors, but during the editing I keep getting autocomplete
errors.
Thanks in advance.
