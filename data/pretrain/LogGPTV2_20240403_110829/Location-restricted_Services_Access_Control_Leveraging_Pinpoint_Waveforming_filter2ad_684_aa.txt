ABSTRACT
We propose a novel wireless technique named pinpoint wave-
forming to achieve the location-restricted service access con-
trol, i.e., providing wireless services to users at eligible lo-
cations only. The proposed system is inspired by the fact
that when two identical wireless signals arrive at a receiver
simultaneously, they will constructively interfere with each
other to form a boosted signal whose amplitude is twice of
that of an individual signal. As such, the location-restricted
service access control can be achieved through transmitting
at a weak power, so that receivers at undesired locations
(where the constructive interference vanishes), will experi-
ence a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and hence a high
bit error rate that retards the correct decoding of received
messages. At the desired location (where the constructive
interference happens), the receiver obtains a boosted SNR
that enables the correct message decoding.
To solve the diﬃculty of determining an appropriate trans-
mit power, we propose to entangle the original transmit sig-
nals with jamming signals of opposite phase. The jamming
signals can signiﬁcantly reduce the SNR at the undesired re-
ceivers but cancel each other at the desired receiver to cause
no impact. With the jamming entanglement, the transmit
power can be any value speciﬁed by the system administra-
tor. To enable the jamming entanglement, we create the
channel calibration technique that allows the synchroniza-
tion of transmit signals at the desired location. We develop
a prototype system using the Universal Software Deﬁned
Radio Peripherals (USRPs). The evaluation results show
that the receiver at the desired location obtains a through-
put ranging between 0.9 and 0.93, whereas an eavesdropper
that is 0.3 meter away from a desired location has a through-
put approximately equal to 0.

INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of wireless technologies, it is
highly desirable to enforce location-restricted service access
control that provides wireless services to users at eligible
locations only. For example,
• To focus limited resources on legitimate customers,
restaurants and coﬀee shops may oﬀer internet access
to wireless users only when they are sitting at tables.
• Companies may allow wireless network access only to
employees working in selected oﬃce cubicles, in order
to comply export control policies.
• In wireless surveillance system, the monitor cameras
may need to deliver their video streams to speciﬁc users
at speciﬁc locations, e.g, personnel in the security con-
trol room, to reduce the privacy leakage.
Surprisingly, existing techniques fail to achieve this goal
in a secure and eﬃcient manner. We discuss existing tech-
niques and their shortcomings below.
• User account control: The service access control
can be achieved by creating individual accounts for
each user, where a user can obtain the wireless service
by providing a correct username and password. How-
ever, this may be insuﬃcient for secure access control
to location-restricted services, as a user might share
the account information with friends. This method
also requires active account administration which is
impractical for location-restricted services with high
turnover such as in the restaurant example.
• MAC address binding: MAC address binding is a
variant of the user account control. A wireless router
allows the access of wireless users only when they have
valid Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. Never-
theless, the users may share their MAC addresses with
others who are not at the desired locations.
• Beamforming techniques: Beamforming techniques
(e.g., [1, 2]) use antenna arrays for directional signal
transmission or reception. These techniques may be
utilized to send the service data to wireless users at
the speciﬁed directions, but again they cannot enable
the location-restricted service access control, because
292Figure 1: Con-
structive inter-
ference of

waves.
Figure 2: A naive idea
all other wireless users are able to receive the service
data as long as they reside in the signal coverage range
of the antenna arrays.
• Localization plus encryption: Service providers
may use existing localization algorithms like time-of-
arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) to ﬁnd the
locations of wireless users, and encrypt the service data
so that users at target locations can use appropriate
keys to decrypt it. However, cryptographic encryp-
tion may cause a signiﬁcant latency, and thus fail to
support common services like high-speed downloading
and online video watching. Also, like the password
case, with compromised cryptographic keys, undesired
receivers at other locations can still obtain the service.
In this paper, we would like to develop a novel and practi-
cal wireless system that achieves the aforementioned location-
restricted service access control to support emerging wireless
requirements. Our basic idea is to leverage the eﬀect of con-
structive interference as shown in Figure 1. The crests of two
identical waves meet at the same point, and then both waves
form a new wave with the same shape but the magnitude is
boosted to twice of that of an individual wave.
This observation inspires us to propose a new wireless
system that pinpoints wireless services to users at eligible
locations only.
Intuitively, we can set up a naive system
as illustrated in Figure 2. The service provider concurrently
sends identical service packets (e.g., down-link internet data)
using two (or more) transmitters. Assume an ideal synchro-
nization algorithm is in use and these packets arrive at the
receiver at the service location simultaneously. Thus, they
constructively interfere with each other to form a boosted
received packet whose magnitude is twice of that of an indi-
vidual packet.
In practice, a small time shift among the packet arrival
times may exist due to synchronization imperfections. At
the service location, such a time shift should be less than a
certain threshold, so that the constructive interference still
exists and the receiver is able to decode the received packet.
To prevent leaking the service to undesired receivers, in-
cluding receivers close to the service provider, an intuitive
way is to transmit at a weak power so that receivers at un-
desired locations (where the constructive interference van-
ishes) will experience a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and
hence a high bit error rate that retards the correct decod-
ing of the received messages. At the desired location (where
the constructive interference happens), the receiver obtains
a boosted SNR that enables the correct message decoding.
However, how to select an appropriate signal transmit
power becomes a challenging question. If the transmit power
is too small, the constructive interference may not incur
enough power to allow receivers at the service location to
correctly decode the received data. On the other hand, if
the transmit power is too large, receivers outside of the ser-
vice location may recognize the signal and thus can decode
the received data. To avoid the diﬃculty of determining the
transmit power, we propose to entangle the original transmit
signals with jamming signals, so that the jamming signals
can signiﬁcantly reduce the SNR at the undesired receivers
but cancel each other at the desired receiver to cause no
impact.
Speciﬁcally, for a pair of transmitters T1 and T2, we gen-
erate a pair of jamming signals j1 and j2, where j1 and j2
are of the opposite phase (i.e., j1 = −j2). The transmitter
T1 then adds the jamming signal j1 to its transmit signal.
Similarly, T2 adds the jamming signal j2 to its transmit sig-
nal. Finally, T1 and T2 send s + j1 and s + j2 to the wireless
channel respectively, where s is the original signal to be sent
by both transmitters. At the service location, due to the
constructive interference, the original signal s boosts, but
the jamming signals j1 and j2 cancel each other (they are of
opposite phase). At other locations where constructive in-
terference vanishes, j1 and j2 do not cancel each other, and
instead they serve as jamming signals to decrease the SNR
at receivers at these locations. Consequently, the receivers
will experience a service of bad quality.
We point out that in an ideal free space propagation envi-
ronment, constructive interference of electromagnetic waves
occur whenever the phase diﬀerence between the waves is a
multiple of a half period. This means there exist multiple
locations, where the constructive interference may happen.
However, in a practical wireless environment, because wire-
less channels are uncorrelated, every a half wavelength, the
original transmit signals sent by diﬀerent transmitters may
experience diﬀerent channel distortions when they propagate
to the receiver. Therefore, at the locations where the con-
structive interference should happen, signals received from
diﬀerent transmitters show diﬀerent shapes due to distor-
tions and thus achieve a poor constructive interference. To
solve this problem and pinpoint the service to the desired
location only, we propose a channel synchronization tech-
nique that compensates the channel distortion at the desired
constructive interference location, so that received signals
exhibit the same wave shape when they arrive at this loca-
tion. The channel synchronization technique is customized
for the desired location only. For other constructive interfer-
ence locations, the arrived signals still show diﬀerent shapes,
thereby yielding the same low SNR as other non-constructive
interference locations as proved in Section 6.2.
We name the proposed system as the pinpoint waveform-
ing system. Figure 2 is a naive example of this system.
Nevertheless, to transform this naive system to a real-world
system, non-trivial eﬀort should be done to answer the fol-
lowing basic questions:
• Synchronization: How can the system achieve prop-
agation synchronization, so that signals sent by multi-
ple transmitters can arrive at the service location con-
currently? Moreover, how can we achieve the afore-
mentioned channel synchronization?
• Tolerable time shift: Signals sent by transmitters
are expected to arrive at the desired receiver simulta-
neously to form the constructive interference, but in
Wave1Wave2Resultant wave11011101…...…...293practice a small time shift among them might exist
due to the processing delay and synchronization im-
perfections. What is the tolerable time shift that can
still enable the constructive interference at the desired
receiver?
• Service area size: The service area is deﬁned as the
neighborhood area, within which the constructive in-
terference happens and a receiver can receive the ser-
vice data with a good quality. It should be hard for re-
ceivers outside of the service area to obtain the service
data. To ensure the accurate service access control, a
critical question is how large the service area is.
In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of the pin-
point waveforming system by answering the above essential
concerns about synchronization, tolerable time shift, and
service area size. We implement a prototype of the pinpoint
waveforming system on top of the Universal Software Ra-
dio Peripherals (USRPs), and evaluate the performance of
the prototype system through comprehensive experiments.
Our results show that the receiver obtains a high throughput
ranging between 0.90 and 0.93 when it is at the desired loca-
tion, but this throughput dramatically decreases when the
receiver is moved from the desired location. In particular, at
a distance of 0.3 meter, the throughput of the eavesdropper
approaches to 0.
2. SYNCHRONIZATION
We discuss synchronization ﬁrst, because synchronization
is the basis for the proposed pinpoint waveforming system
to achieve the constructive interference of original signals
and the cancelation of the jamming signals. Synchronization
includes three components, and they are clock synchroniza-
tion, propagation synchronization, and channel synchroniza-
tion.
2.1 Clock and Propagation Synchronization
Clock synchronization deals with the discrepancy of the
clocks of multiple transmitters, so that they transmit ser-
vice packets at the same time. In the proposed system, all
transmitters are connected to the same service provider, and
thereby their clocks are roughly the same.
The distances between the receiver and each transmitter
may be diﬀerent. Accordingly, signals sent by these trans-
mitters may arrive at the receiver at diﬀerent time even if
they are sent at the same time. To compensate the propaga-
tion diﬀerence, the service provider needs to perform propa-
gation synchronization through adjusting the transmit time
of each transmitter. Propagation synchronization has been
extensively studied in the context of wireless sensor networks
(e.g., [3, 4]). In a traditional way, the receiver broadcasts a
beacon signal, and the transmitter (service provider) ad-
justs each transmitter’s transmit time based on beacon ar-
rival time recorded at this transmitter [5]. Since transmitter
clocks are inherently the same, the proposed system is com-
patible with the traditional synchronization approach.
Note that after clock and propagation synchronization,
due to the processing delay and synchronization imperfec-
tions, the time shift will still exist between the signal arrival
times. In section 5, we show the impact of the time shift
and the maximum time shift that can be tolerated by the
system.

nel synchronization

synchronization
2.2 Channel Synchronization
The impact of channel eﬀect cannot be neglected. The
signals sent by diﬀerent transmitters may undergo diﬀerent
channel eﬀects. When the signals arrive at the receiver,
their shapes accordingly exhibit diﬀerent distortions, and
thus the constructive interference may diminish due to the
wave shape discrepancy. The transmit (jamming) signals
should be calibrated so that they have the same (reverse)
shapes when they arrive at the receiver.
Figure 3 shows a real measured example of the channel im-
pact without the channel synchronization. Two transmitters
are separated by a certain distance to result in uncorrelated
channels (i.e., 0.75 meter for a 2.4 GHz channel). The re-
ceiver is 3 meters away from both transmitters. Each device
is a USRP connected to a PC. Both transmitters send the
same sequence of 64 symbols (i.e., the transmission unit at
the wireless physical layer) to the receiver. As seen in Figure
3, the amplitude of symbols received from both transmitters
are diﬀerent from each other due to the diﬀerent channel dis-
tortions. Figure 4 shows the amplitude of received symbols
after the channel synchronization. Both received symbols
then become similar to each other.
Signal modulation: Before we discuss the proposed
channel calibration algorithm, we ﬁrst introduce the sig-
nal modulation/demodulation to facilitate the reader’s un-
derstanding. We focus our discussion on I/Q modulation,
because it is widely used in modern wireless systems.
In
I/Q modulation, signals are transmitted in the form of sym-
bols, which are the transmission unit at the wireless physical
layer. We use Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) mod-
ulation, a typical I/Q modulation, as an example to show
how I/Q modulation works.
QPSK encodes two bits into one symbol at a time.
In
Figure 5 (a), bits 00, 01, 10, and 11 are represented by
points whose coordinates are (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), and (1,1)
in an I/Q plane, respectively. The I/Q plane is called a
constellation diagram. A symbol is the coordinate of a point
on the constellation diagram. Due to the channel noise,
a received symbol is not exactly the same as the original
symbol sent by the sender. To demodulate, the receiver
outputs the point that is closest to the received symbol on
the constellation diagram as the demodulation result.
2.2.1 Basic Channel Synchronization
Same signals from diﬀerent transmitters will exhibit dis-
tinct wave shapes when they come to the receiver, because
they undergo diﬀerent channel distortions. Thus, on the
constellation diagram, the receiver not only receives multi-
ple symbols from the multiple transmitters at the same time,
but these symbols have diﬀerent phases and amplitudes. As

symbols from four transmitters and these symbols are at dif-
ferent positions on the constellation diagram. The received
symbols can interfere with each other, and consequently it
becomes diﬃcult for the receiver to correctly decode the re-
ceived packets. Hence, channel synchronization is required
in the proposed scheme so that the received symbols can
converge to the same ideal point to form a good construc-
tive interference.

In our basic idea, we propose to calibrate the symbols
before they are transmitted to oﬀset the channel distortion.
As shown in Figure 5 (b), the original symbol sent by the
