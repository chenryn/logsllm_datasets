Substituting (19) and (21) back into (18), the expected dis-

Now, we look at S . In Fig. 4 where k = 2, we can see that
if an attacker (i) manages to capture the signature elements
marked by thick frames, namely s1,1, s2,2, s2,3 and s3,2,
and (ii) block these signature elements from the recipients,
then the attacker can forge a signature using any two of the
elements surrounded by the red dashed contour. In reality, r
captured signatures use at most rk distinct one-way chains,
but for small k/t and r, it is approximately true that r
captured signatures use exactly rk distinct one-way chains
(and we used the same approximation for (17)). Let us
denote by Gi the set of one-way chains corresponding to the

6. APPLICATION TO WIDE-AREA
MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS
The analysis in the previous section forms the basis for
comparison of BiBa, TV-HORS, SCU+ and TSV+. For
the comparison to be performed in the context of the wide-
area measurement system (WAMS), an introduction to the
WAMS is given here. A WAMS is essentially a high-speed
network of phasor measurement units (PMUs), whose
sole objective is to report voltage and current phasor mea-
surements (amplitude, frequency and phase). Given enough
real-time phasors, the state of the grid (voltage and phase
angle of each bus) can be tracked, giving the utility enhanced
“situational awareness” about its system. This enhanced sit-
uational awareness provides many advantages: improved op-
eration planning, optimized transmission assets utilization,
system stabilization, disturbances containment, etc. In fact,
the lack of this level of situational awareness is one of the
factors that contributed to the infamous 2003 North Amer-
ica and 2003 Italy blackouts [28, 30].
The WAMS consists of four components: (i) synchronized
PMUs (also called synchrophasors), (ii) phasor data con-
centrators (PDCs), (iii) wide area network (WAN), and (iv)
real-time database and data archiver [16]. Fig. 6 shows
the four-layer generic architecture of the WAMS [16]. The
PMUs in Layer 1 report voltage and current phasors that
are time-stamped with high-precision internal clocks and
the Global Positioning System at 10-30 frames per second,
enabling the correlation of phasor measurements across a
wide grid area. The PMUs transmit the data in the IEEE
C37.118 format to the PDCs in Layer 2 via the WAN. The
PDCs correlate the time-tagged data, and forward the data
to the Applications Data Buﬀer in Layer 3. The Applica-
tions Data Buﬀer monitors the data for losses, errors and
295synchronization, in addition to supplying the data in the re-
quired format to the applications in Layer 4. Layer 4 consists
of the Real Time Database and Data Archiver, which is re-
sponsible for collecting and archiving data for post-incident
analysis and assessment. Layer 4 also contains applications
for monitoring, control and protection functions.
PMUs are required to multicast phasor data to multiple
consumers including PDCs for communication redundancy,
whereas PDCs at the same hierarchical level are required to
share data with each other through multicast [1].

7. COMPARING MULTICAST AUTHENTI-
CATION SCHEMES
With application to the WAMS in mind, the MA schemes
BiBa, TV-HORS, SCU+ and TSV+ are evaluated in terms
of the metrics (i) Lσ / S , (ii) Cσ / S , and (ii) Cv / S ; and
compared with each other. The parameters of each scheme
are set under the following constraints:
• Security level: Each scheme must provide a security
level of at least 80 bits.
• Signature length: A recent simulation study [9] sug-
gests that a signature should be at most 300 bytes, be-
cause a C37.118 frame can be as much as 1200 bytes
long while a WAN typically supports a maximum trans-
mission unit (MTU) of 1500 bytes.
• Hash length: Since second preimage resistance is
weaker than preimage resistance, we are primarily con-
cerned with the former. For any truncated hash of
SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256 and SHA-512, the actual
second preimage resistance is inﬂuenced by the preim-
age length, but an 80-bit truncated SHA-384 hash has
a second preimage resistance of exactly 80 bits [7]. So,
we set lH = 80 assuming SHA-384 hashes are trun-
cated to 80 bits.
• Number of one-way chains: With the exception
of SCU+, we ﬁx t = 1024 following standard practice
[15, 20, 23, 31].
By default, we conﬁgure the parameters according to Table 1
to satisfy the constraints above, as well as to minimize the
signature length due to the large data volume in a WAMS.
For BiBa, two conﬁgurations are provided: BiBa0 is the de-
fault conﬁguration, whereas BiBa1 satisﬁes the additional
constraint Cσ ≤ 10 Cv . Compared to BiBa0, BiBa1 trades
oﬀ communication eﬃciency for signing eﬃciency, but can-
not support r ≥ 4. For SCU+ and TSV+, there are no
suitable parameter values that satisfy the above constraints
for r ≥ 3. Two TSV+ conﬁgurations are provided: TSV+0
is the default conﬁguration, whereas TSV+1 satisﬁes the ad-
ditional constraints Cσ ≤ 10 Cv and Cv ≤ 10 Cσ (i.e., Cσ and
Cv are at most one order of magnitude diﬀerent from each
other). Compared to TSV+0, TSV+1 is meant to provide
more balanced signing and veriﬁcation costs.

Fig. 7 to 9 show the bar charts for Lσ / S , Cσ / S , and
Cv / S . The charts show only r = 1, 2 since not all conﬁgu-
rations support r ≥ 3. BiBa0 is the best performer in signa-
ture length but has far poorer eﬃciency in signing than the
others. BiBa1 produces slightly longer signatures but has
signiﬁcantly better signing eﬃciency than BiBa0, so BiBa1
is more practical. SCU+ is eﬃcient in signing and veriﬁca-
tion but requires far longer signatures than the others for
the same security level. TSV+ (both TSV+0 and TSV+1)
is more eﬃcient than TV-HORS in signature length when
r = 1, but not when r = 2; moreover, TSV+ is several
orders of magnitude slower than TV-HORS in signing and
veriﬁcation. Compared to TSV+0, TSV+1 has more bal-
anced signing and veriﬁcation costs, and is hence better for
senders and receivers with similar capabilities. Despite its
algorithmic simplicity, TV-HORS is a good performer in all
categories. Although proposed after BiBa, SCU and TSV
do not oﬀer clear advantages over BiBa.
8. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work is motivated by the need for an eﬃcient mul-
ticast authentication (MA) scheme to secure the required
real-time multicast traﬃc within a wide-area measurement
system (WAMS). For real-time systems like the WAMS, an
MA scheme is best constructed from a multiple-time signa-
ture (MTS) scheme rather than a conventional digital sig-
nature scheme [15, 31].
Instead of designing yet another
MTS-based MA scheme from scratch, this work executes
the common sense of ﬁrst attempting to ﬁnd suitable can-
didates among the many MTS-based MA schemes already
proposed to date. To this end, we ﬁrst identify four rep-
resentative MA schemes, namely BiBa, TV-HORS, SCU+
and TSV+. Among these MA schemes, SCU+ is an MA
scheme we constructed from an MTS scheme designed for
secure code update [29], and TSV+ is our patched version
of TSV [15], an MA scheme which we show to be vulner-

able. We then provide rigorous mathematical analysis of
these schemes. Our simulation-validated analysis ﬁlls the
gaps of, and at places rectiﬁes or improves existing analy-
ses. Based on our analysis, our comparison shows that TV-
HORS, while algorithmically unsophisticated, has the most
balanced computational and communication eﬃciencies rel-
ative to security levels. SCU+, TSV+ and by extension
SCU and TSV do not oﬀer clear advantages over BiBa, the
oldest among the studied schemes. As a follow-up to this
preliminary study, we aim to expand our analysis and com-
parison to cover more schemes. Theoretical accounting of
memory costs is nontrivial and will be attempted in future
work. Just as naming a single superior MTS scheme is non-
trivial [25], naming a single superior MA scheme is equally
nontrivial. This preliminary work serves as a ﬁrst step, and
already we know that TV-HORS has set a benchmark.
