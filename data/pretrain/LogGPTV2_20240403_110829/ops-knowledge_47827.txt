User: How to use Python to write a script to regularly scan for vulnerabilities on the server and send an email to notify the administrator?
Assistant: To achieve this task, you need to install Python-related libraries, such as pymongo and smtplib. Then you can use the following steps to write a Python script: 1. Write code to obtain the latest vulnerability information on the server. 2. Use the SMTP library to send an email to notify the administrator. 3. Use a scheduled task library (such as APScheduler) to execute the above code regularly. The following is a sample code: ``` import pymongo import smtplib import ssl from email.mime.text import MIMEText from apscheduler.schedulers.blocking import BlockingScheduler # Connect to the MongoDB database to obtain vulnerability information client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost: 27017/") db = client["vulnerabilities"] collection = db["vulnerability_list"] latest_vulnerability = collection.find_one(sort=[("date", -1)]) # send mail port = 465 smtp_server = "smtp. gmail.com" sender_email = "youremail@gmail.com" # sender email receiver_email = "admin@example.com" # recipient email password = input("Type your password and press enter: ") message = MIMEText( "Latest vulnerability found: " + latest_vulnerability["name"]) message["Subject"] = "Vulnerability Alert" message["From"] = sender_email message["To"] = receiver_email context = ssl.create_default_context() with smtplib .SMTP_SSL(smtp_server, port, context=context) as server: server.login(sender_email, password) server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message.as_string()) # Regular execution scheduler = BlockingScheduler() scheduler.add_job(send_vulnerability_alert, 'interval', minutes=60) scheduler.start() ``` The above code uses the MongoDB database to obtain the latest vulnerability information on the server, and sends an email to notify the administrator. Then use the APScheduler library to execute the above code regularly (execute the send_vulnerability_alert function every 60 minutes).
