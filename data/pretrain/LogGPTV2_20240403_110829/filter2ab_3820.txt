### Title: Black Hat US-18: A Deep Dive into Hyper-V Architecture and Vulnerabilities

Virtualization technology is increasingly becoming the foundation for platform security and cloud infrastructure. However, virtualization stacks, being software, are not immune to vulnerabilities. Few things are as fascinating—or as alarming—as a guest-to-host exploit.

Research in this cutting-edge field is not only intellectually stimulating but also highly lucrative. Microsoft offers a bug bounty program that rewards up to $250,000 USD for vulnerabilities discovered in Hyper-V. To aid your efforts in vulnerability hunting, we will provide an in-depth overview of how Hyper-V operates, with a focus on the information you, as a security researcher, need to identify potential vulnerabilities. This will include relevant details about the Hyper-V hypervisor and its supporting kernel-mode and user-mode components. Additionally, we will showcase some of the intriguing vulnerabilities we have encountered in Hyper-V and discuss the potential rewards they would have fetched if reported through the bounty program.
