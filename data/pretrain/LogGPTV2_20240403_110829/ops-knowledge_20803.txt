User: I have a simple cloud IDE,I want to make it able to build and run applications remotely, the target application's source files will be in a remote server in isolated virtual machine (e.g Windows 8.1,or Ubuntu 14.04). It's not difficult to build that application but how to run it and view its output to users ?
What if it's a desktop application (suppose it's written in C# or Java or Python)?
Note: users access there applications only using browsers (e.g Firefox,Chrome,...)
Edit: desktop application may contains GUI stuff not only console ;)
Assistant: You need a web application.Now this web application when loads send request to backend code that backend code will do SSH to remote machine and read the file from specific location.Now that read stream will be send back in response and displayed on web based UI. In these type of application few thinks matters.
1) Like if you whole file at once then it will take time to display that content to user.Better idea will be read around 100 lines at once and when user scroll down then again send request to web server to read next 100 lines in this way you can decrease response time and better user experience.
