User: How do I configure machine network interfaces for different VLANs when using Cisco switches?
Assistant: The steps to configure the machine network interface for different VLANs are as follows: 1. Create VLAN: Create the required VLAN on the switch. 2. Port configuration: Configure the network interface of the machine to the corresponding VLAN. Configuration can be done through the command line interface (CLI) or the graphical user interface (GUI). 3. Configure the VLAN sub-interface: Configure the VLAN sub-interface on the router, which acts as the gateway of the VLAN. 4. Configure routing: Configure routing to enable communication between different VLANs. You can use static routing or dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP. The above are the basic configuration steps, and the specific operation needs to be implemented according to the specific Cisco switch model and software version.
