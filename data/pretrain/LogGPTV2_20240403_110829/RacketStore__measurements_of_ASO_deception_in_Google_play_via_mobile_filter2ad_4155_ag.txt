Figure 16 illustrates the advertisement displayed to users on the Instagram Feed, Explore, and Stories. When users click on the ad, they are directed to a website where the study is explained (see Figure 17).

### Device Fingerprinting Process
To address the problem of identifying unique devices, we employed the following process for fingerprinting device snapshots:

1. **Grouping Snapshots**: We first grouped all collected device snapshots into \( n \) candidate devices based on their install IDs.
2. **Comparing Candidate Pairs**: We then compared pairs of candidate devices to identify and coalesce those with different install IDs that actually belong to the same device.
   - For each install ID \( x \), we computed the Racket-Store install interval \([T_f, T_l]\), where \( T_f \) and \( T_l \) are the first and last timestamps recorded in our database from snapshots belonging to \( x \).
   - Install pairs \((x, y)\) with overlapping installation intervals were declared as different devices.
3. **Coalescing Devices**: Candidate device pairs without overlapping installation intervals were coalesced based on their Android ID (if present). If the pairs had the same Android ID, they were considered the same device; otherwise, they were treated as different devices.
4. **Validation**: To validate this approach, we computed the Jaccard similarity between candidate device pairs:
   - For installed apps, the Jaccard similarity was calculated based on sets of tuples \((a, t)\), where \( a \) is an app and \( t \) is the install time registered by the Android API.
   - For registered accounts, the Jaccard similarity was also computed.
   - Candidate device pairs with different Android IDs had a Jaccard similarity for installed apps of at most 0.5625.
   - Candidate device pairs with a Jaccard similarity above 0.53 for registered accounts had low similarity for installed apps.

### Recruitment Material
**Figure 16** shows the ad used to recruit regular users on Instagram Feed, Explore, and Stories. Upon clicking, users are directed to a website (Figure 17(a)) where the study is explained. **Figure 17(b)** displays the registration page, which appears after the user clicks "Sign Me Up" and reads the content on the web page. The recruiting message, shown to both regular users and ASO workers, is as follows:

"We are researchers from a US university, looking for individuals who write paid reviews on Google Play and are willing to participate in a user study. This study aims to enhance our understanding of how app search optimization workers interact with Google Play apps. 

If you agree to participate, we will ask you to install an app from Google Play and keep it installed for at least two days. You will be paid $1 for installing the app and an additional 20 cents per day for keeping it installed, up to $1.40 per week. We may also ask you to use the app to write reviews, for which you will be compensated at a negotiated rate.

Your information will be kept confidential, and we will never reveal any details that could be linked to you. Participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time. If you agree to participate, please reply to this message and answer the following questions:
1. Have you ever written paid reviews on Google Play?
2. How many user accounts do you control on Google Play?
3. How many mobile devices do you own or can access?
4. On how many devices can you install our app?
5. For how many days can you keep our app installed?
6. Are you an administrator, or do you post reviews yourself?
7. How many ASO jobs are you currently working on?"

**Figure 18** shows screenshots of the information presented to participants upon installing the RacketStore app, including the privacy policy (Figure 18(a)) and the in-app disclosure (Figure 18(b)).

### Consent Form Excerpts
The consent form provided to each participant includes the following information:

- **Procedures**:
  1. Click on the “I Approve” checkbox at the end of the form.
  2. Install the RacketStore app from a link we provide.
  3. Keep the app installed for at least two days if you wish to participate.

- **Confidentiality**: Your participation is confidential. We will not make your answers public and will store them securely.

- **Risks and Discomforts**: Risks do not exceed those of a regular interaction with prospective employers. We will not share your data with anyone.

- **Use of Information**: We collect device and app usage information, IP address, device characteristics, and other technical information. You can change permissions in your device settings.

- **Mobile Device Access and Data**: We request access to certain features and automatically collect device information.

- **Compensation**: You will receive $1 for installing the app and 20 cents per day for keeping it installed, up to $1.40 per week.

- **Right to Decline or Withdraw**: Participation is voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without affecting any benefits.

### Additional Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy Policy**: The privacy policy is included in the Google Play profile and within the app, explaining the data collection process and requiring explicit consent.
- **Requested Permissions**: The RacketStore app requests specific Android permissions, and data collection only occurs with explicit consent.
- **Data Protection**: We use GDPR-recommended pseudonymization and delete all personally identifiable information (PII) after use.
- **Collected PII**: Table 3 summarizes the PII collected, the reasons, and the deletion timeline.
- **Risk to Benefits Assessment**: Participants are informed of the risks and benefits, and we believe the risks are reasonable.
- **ASO Legality and Stigma**: ASO work is not illegal or stigmatized in many countries in the Global South, and participants are not afraid of legal repercussions.
- **Compensation and Professional Security**: Compensation is fair, and we ensure that the research does not negatively impact participants' livelihoods.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the study is conducted ethically and transparently, with the utmost respect for participants' privacy and security.
