To address this problem, we used the following process to fin-
gerprint snapshots. Specifically, we first grouped all the collected
device snapshots into n candidate devices, based on their install ID.
(cid:1) pairs of candidates to identify and coa-
We then compared the(cid:0)n
lesce candidate devices with different install IDs that are actually
the same device. First, for each install ID x, we compute the Racket-
Store install interval [Tf , tl] where tf and tl are the first and last
timestamp recorded in our database from snapshots that belong to
x. We then declare as different devices, install pairs (x, y) that have
overlapping installation intervals. We then coalesced candidate de-
vice pairs that do not overlap on installation intervals based on their
Android ID (if present): if the pairs have the same Android ID the
two installs belong to the same device, otherwise they are different
devices. To validate this approach, we have computed the Jaccard
similarity between candidate device pairs, i.e., (1) their sets of tuples
(a, t) where a is an app and t is the install time registered by the
Android API for app a, and (2) their sets of registered accounts.
Candidate device pairs with different Android IDs had a Jaccard
similarity for installed apps of at most 0.5625. Candidate device
pairs with Jaccard similarity above 0.53 for registered accounts, had
low similarity for installed apps.
B RECRUITMENT MATERIAL
Figure 16 shows a snapshot of the ad we have shown to audience
on Instagram Feed, Explore, and Stories to recruit regular users.
Upon clicking, users are sent to a website, shown in Figure 17(a)

interact with Google Play apps.
If you agree to participate in the study, we will ask you to install
an app from Google Play and keep it installed for at least two days.
We will pay you $1 when you install the app. We will then pay you
20 cents for each day when you keep the app installed, on a weekly
basis. That is, we will pay you $1.40 per week, for just keeping the
app installed. We may also ask you to use the app to write reviews.
If this happens, we will pay you additional money, at a rate that we
will negotiate.
Please note that we will guard the information that you provide
and that we collect, with the utmost secrecy. We will never reveal
to anyone any information that may be linked to you, including
the fact that you participated in our study
Your participation is completely voluntary and you may choose to
withdraw at any time. If you agree to participate, please reply to this
message. Also, please send us answers to the following questions:
1. Have you ever written paid reviews in Google Play?
2. How many user accounts do you control in Google Play?
3. How many mobile devices do you own or can access?
4. On how many devices can you install our app?
5. For how many days can you keep our app installed?
6. Are you an administrator or do you post reviews yourself?
7. How many ASO jobs are you currently working on?”

C CONSENT FORM EXCERPTS
The consent form that we presented to each participant includes
the following information:
Procedures. If you agree to be in the study, we will ask you to do
the following things:
1. You will need to click on “I Approve” checkbox at the end of
this form. 2. We will send you a link for the RacketStore app in
Google Play and you will install it. 3. You will need to keep the
app installed as long as you desire to participate in the study, but
preferably for at least two days.
Please be assured that your participation in this study is confi-
dential. We will not make your answers public, and we will store
them securely (under password protection) in the computers of the
researchers.
Risks And/Or Discomforts. Risks of participating in this study do
not exceed those that you would encounter in a regular interaction
with other prospective employers. Findings from this study may be
used by providers like Google to attempt to detect and eliminate
fraud. However, we will never share your data with anyone, for any
reason. In fact, we will only store and publish aggregate information
from multiple participants that we recruit. Aggregates will not
be useful to someone to, e.g., de-anonymize you or any of the
participants.
Use of Your Information. We automatically collect certain infor-
mation that includes device and app usage information, your IP
address, device characteristics, storage, information about installed
655
and used apps, and other technical information. We also collect
public information hosted on the Google Play Store for the reviews
that you posted. We collect such information periodically as part of
a research study that aims to help us understand how you use your
apps and device in order to detect review manipulation or fraud. If
you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in
your device’s settings.
Mobile Device Access. We request access or permission to certain
features from your mobile device, including your mobile device’s
storage, battery level, foreground app, accounts registered, and apps
installed in the device.
Mobile Device Data. We automatically collect device informa-
tion (such as your mobile device ID, model and manufacturer) and
version information.
Confidentiality. The records of this study will be kept private and
will be protected to the fullest extent provided by law. In any sort
of report we might publish, we will not include any information
that will make it possible to identify a subject. Research records
will be stored securely and only the researcher team will have
access to the records. However, your records may be reviewed for
audit purposes by authorized University or other agents who will
be bound by the same provisions of confidentiality. Those agents
will be unable to recover your identity as we do not collect any
personally identifiable information.
Compensation. You will receive a payment of $1 for installing
the app. You will then receive 20 cents for each day when you keep
the app installed, on a weekly basis. That is, you will be paid $1.40
per week, for just keeping the app installed.
Right to Decline or Withdraw. Your participation in this study is
voluntary. You are free to participate in the study or withdraw your
consent at any time during the study. Your withdrawal or lack of
participation will not affect any benefits to which you are otherwise
entitled.
D ADDITIONAL ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Privacy Policy. We included RacketStore’s privacy policy both in
its Google Play profile page, and inside the app, right after the main
layout that summarizes the study. The privacy policy explains the
data collection process in terms of the information being collected,
including that we collect the data periodically and that we collect
the reviews posted from the accounts registered on the device (see
Figure 18(a) in Appendix C). The in-app disclosure (Figure 18(b))
further summarizes the privacy policy. In addition to the consent
form, participants also had to give explicit consent to the in-app
disclosure. The RacketStore app only collected data if the user
provided explicit consent. Therefore, all consenting participants
were aware of all the data that we collected.
Requested Permissions. RacketStore explicitly requests two An-
droid permissions, PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS and GET_ACCOUNTS, which
participant need to explicitly grant. If any permission is not granted,
RacketStore does not collect the corresponding information.
Data Protection. We used GDPR [63] recommended pseudonymi-
sation for data processing and statistics, and other generally ac-
cepted good practices for privacy preservation. At the completion
of the study, we deleted all PII. We also only generated aggregated

research team.
Collected PII. Table 3 summarizes the PII we collected, how we
collected it, the reasons, and how long it was stored. It shows
that the PII we collected consists of user accounts registered on
participant devices, e-mail address, the device IP address and IDs.
The RacketStore app collected the accounts and device IDs; the
backend server collected the device IP address and the recruitment
website collected the participant e-mail address.
We needed registered accounts for the device classification task.
We needed the participant e-mail account in order to contact them
with details of the main study and for the follow-up study. We used
device IP addresses to help us recruit regular users from the same
regions with the ASO worker participants. Further, we needed the
device IDs to help us fingerprint snapshots, i.e., group collected
snapshots by the device that reported them.
We have deleted all accounts, device IDs and IP addresses after
use. We have deleted participant e-mail addresses after the study.
Risk To Benefits Assessment. The consent form informed par-
ticipants on the risks associated with the research. We presented
risks in relations to the participant regular interactions. We did
not store PII after the completion of the study, and only published
aggregate data. We believe that participation risks are reasonable
in relation to benefits. We informed participants that benefits for
participation include helping us understand and model app search
optimization, and also raising their awareness to security and pri-
vacy risks that stem from installing malware, granting requested
permissions, and account/password management strategies.
ASO Legality and Stigma. There are no direct local legal policies
to criminalize black hat app search optimization in many countries
of the Global South. For example, in Bangladesh, there is not di-
rect law to prevent such activities. The law closest to this issue
is a recently passed ICT Act that prohibits the dissemination of
incorrect information over the Internet [19]. However, this law has
mostly been applied to control the dissemination of politically mo-
tivated, unfounded information over social media (see [18, 20, 26],
for example). However, ASO work has never been addressed by law
enforcing agencies. A similar situation is also present in many other
countries in the Global South including India and Pakistan. Hence,
the job of our participants was not illegal or unethical according to
their own law of the land.
We also asked several participants questions on the legal aspects
of their work, Do you need to be careful about anything? What are
your common fear or risks?. Participants claimed that they are not
afraid, for instance, one worker said that “What we’re doing is a
legal and right job. So no need to be afraid”.
Moreover, ASO work is not stigmatized in most countries in
the Global South. HCI scholars in post-colonial computing argue
that many ideas that western scholars hold around how computers
are used in non-western contexts are often biased by their own
experiences in the West [47]. We argue that the stigma around
ASO is a similar case: While in many parts of the West, ASO work
might occur as a crime, a job that needs to be hidden, that is not
true in countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, or Vietnam. Most
local citizens do not understand the technical details of ASO, mak-
ing it hard for them to judge the work, while in fact, any work
with computers and the Internet is considered prestigious in many
communities [62]. These arguments further suggest that the use of
deception is not required in studies such as the ones we conducted
in this work, when recruiting participants from countries in the
Global South.
Compensation and Professional Security. The compensation
of the participants was determined according to the fair market rate.
We made sure that the rate is not so low that the participants were
exploited, and also not so high that they were coerced. There might
also be a larger concern about the overall impact of our research on
ASO work, in general, that might impact their profession. Previous
work explains why studying the ASO workers does not impact
their livelihood [67]. Nonetheless, we disclosed and explained this
possibility to our participants, and we did not hear any concern
from any of them.
