The generalized pareto cumulative distribution in standard form [1]_ is
defined as:
    F(x;c) = 1-(1-c*x)**(1/c) for c>0 and c0 is the exponential cdf defined as
    F(x;c=0) = 1-exp(-x)
and is not implemented in the scipy.stats.distributions.genpareto
distribution.
To add this limiting case to scipy.stats.distributions.genpareto would  
greatly simplify statistical analysis. Through inference on the shape
parameter, c, the data themselves determine the most approprate type of
tailbehavior and there is no need for making subjective a priori judgement of
which individual extremevalue family to adopt.
