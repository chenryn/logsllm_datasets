The duplicated code in `FormHelper` (FrameworkBundle) and `FormExtension`
(Twig bridge) should be extracted into a common base class
`Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractRenderer`. It's interface should be extracted
into a new `Symfony\Component\Form\FormRendererInterface` (containing the
render*() methods of FormExtension).
The engine specific code should be placed in `TwigRenderer` (Twig bridge) and
`TemplatingRenderer` (FrameworkBundle). `FormHelper` and `FormExtension` can
then simply create such a renderer object and forward any method calls to the
renderer.
@fabpot: Is the Templating component already able to load templates from
components? If yes, we should definitely move `FormHelper`,
`TemplatingRenderer` and the PHP templates to the Form (or Templating)
component to make it self-contained (and usable without FrameworkBundle).
@vicb: Can you do this?
