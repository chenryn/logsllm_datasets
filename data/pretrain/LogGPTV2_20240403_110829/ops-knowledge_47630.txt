User: I am developing an application in google application engine which would have a user profiles kind of feature. I was going through the Google App's online tutorial where I found that the maximum number of static files (app files and static files) should not exceed 3000. I am afraid whether the user's would be able to upload their images when the number of users increase. Is this limitation for the Free Quota only or its even after billing. In the document, its mentioned as the additional limit than the Free Quota.
Please suggest.
Thanks in advance.

One of the limitations in App Engine is that you cannot write directly to the filesystem from your app. Static files would be things like HTML, CSS, javascript and images that are global to your application, and get uploaded manually when you deploy. They are uploaded to and served from different servers than the ones that handle dynamic content.
Since you can't write to the filesystem from your app, files uploaded by users must be saved to the datastore as blobs. These are not considered static files. As others have mentioned, you can use S3 or the Blobstore API, however both of these require billing. With the free quotas, each entity can be up to 1MB, and each HTTP request and response can be up to 10MB. Using standard entities with a BlobProperty, you can easily store and serve dynamically uploaded files up to 1MB, or 10MB if you want to get fancy and store your blob in slices across multiple entities.
