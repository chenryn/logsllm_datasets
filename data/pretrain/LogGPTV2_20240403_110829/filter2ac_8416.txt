### Title: Black Hat US 2021 - Put in One Bug and Pop Out More: An Effective Way of Bug Hunting in Chrome

**Abstract:**

Bugs are rarely unique, especially in large and complex software systems like Chrome. As the system grows, multiple development teams work on various features, leading to a high likelihood that similar code patterns may harbor similar bugs across the codebase. In this presentation, we will use Chrome as a case study to demonstrate how to discover new vulnerabilities by leveraging historical vulnerabilities.

We will introduce several types of code patterns that are particularly prone to vulnerabilities in Chrome, ranging from simpler to more complex. For each pattern, we will provide a detailed description, drawing from examples of classic bugs. We will also outline the basic workflow for identifying similar bugs and discuss methods to refine and adjust these patterns to uncover new, distinct vulnerabilities.

Through this approach, we have successfully identified 24 vulnerabilities in Chrome, resulting in 11 CVEs. Additionally, we will delve into the exploitation of one of these vulnerabilities, which we used to escape the Chrome sandbox during the Tianfu Cup 2020 Cybersecurity Contest. This achievement marks the first time since 2015 that a public contest has seen a successful Chrome sandbox escape in the Chrome category.

**Key Points:**
- **Introduction to Bug Patterns:** Detailed explanation of common vulnerable code patterns in Chrome.
- **Bug Discovery Workflow:** Step-by-step process for finding and refining similar bugs.
- **Case Study:** Exploitation of a specific vulnerability to achieve a Chrome sandbox escape.
- **Achievements:** Overview of the 24 vulnerabilities and 11 CVEs discovered using our method.

This presentation aims to provide valuable insights and practical techniques for effective bug hunting in large-scale software projects.
