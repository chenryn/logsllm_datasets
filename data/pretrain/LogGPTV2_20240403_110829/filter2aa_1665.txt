What this is NOT:
A discussion of political reality:
-Any eg. Trusted Computing Initiative will necessarily involve key 
escrow or similar sophomoric attempt to subvert user security and 
privacy.
-That a large telco recently admitted to transporting 
wheelbarrowloads of data snarfed with span ports onto magnetic tape 
directly into the waiting arms of a well-known TLA says more about 
user apathy than cryptographic insecurity.
A criticism of ex machina randomness:
-With the publication of RFC4086/BCP106, randomness has become a 
standard.  
-Little attention has been paid to the black art of entropy of 
late, as ever-greater CPU clock speed has brought us measurement of 
hardware noise with seemingly quantum granularity.  
-Given the audience's particular penchant for system security (or 
lack thereof), it is incumbent upon the hacker community to punch 
holes in the basic premise, namely that hardware under the control 
of a potentially compromised operating system can be trusted.
-"Law RNG-2: Anyone who uses software to produce random numbers is 
in a “state of sin”. [John von Neumann]" (Wagner, pp. 99)
What this is NOT:
A reference Design:
-Nothing presented here should prompt anyone to try this at home, or to 
trust entropy bits thusly generated, as being cryptographically secure.
-(Patent pending.)
-((Hey, if that laser pointer guy can get away with it...))
What this is NOT:
What this IS:
-An examination of the considerations and challenges inherent in solving 
the problem of reliable cryptographic entropy 
-extra machina
-on a relatively low budget
-using COTS materials
Why?
-extant methods use hardware intrinsic to the system, in theory, all 
systems are pwned, therefore these entropy methods suck.
-extant methods are insufficiently complicated.
-no amount of legislation a la Patriot Act, or rubber-hose 
cryptanalysis, can persuade a cat to confess.
-cat /dev/cat - how postmodern.
Entropy:
Traditionally accepted definitions:
-Shannon's Equation (Shannon)
-Comparison of binary data to statistically typical binary data, 
or testing to see if data compresses ("Maurer's Test")
Project Goals:
1) Produce data to be subjected to tests of randomness.
2) Move entropy study from the theoretical to the practical.
3) Embrace the Heisenberg Effect.
4) Explore attack scenarios using a real-world example not 
implemented in software.
Methodology:
Equipment:
1) Cat
2) RFID tag - model EM4102 - using a Read-Only chip during 
Phase 1 solves some of the issues outlined in : 
www.rfidvirus.org
3) RFID readers - Trossen Robotics Phidget USB reader 
(www.trossenrobotics.com)
4) Data collection equipment - Assembly A (see appendix A)
ITEM #1
ITEM #2
"Random Packette - Feline experimental subject"
ITEM #3
ITEM #4
[not shown]
Methodology:
Process:
-Item #1 (Cat) to be implanted with Item #2 (EM4102).  This may 
require replacement of existing Avid chip, which is proprietary, 
and for which readers are prohibitively expensive, given that 
neither of these chips supports anti-collision.  Special care must 
be taken if this is the case, since EM4102 is not supported by 
local shelters and Veterinarian offices, to prevent the escape of 
Item #1.  
-Item #3 works with Item #4 in several strategic locations around 
Item #1's abode and surrounding environs.  In the initial test 
phase, Item #4 is wireless, using an 802.11 interface and USB 
reading from the Phidget to transmit RFID tag data onto the 802.11 
network, with a timestamp.
-Data so transmitted will be intercepted from the network using 
tcpdump, snort, or similar mechanism, and used to populate a 
relational database.
Methodology:
Process:
-Item #4 are distributed at areas of frequent transit for Item 
#1, as opposed to areas of frequent rest.  In Phase 1, these 
areas are determined using experimentation.  For example, 
feeding/watering areas, litterbox, cat tree, would normally be 
characterized as areas of relatively static activity, but 
experiment may determine suitability.
-Initial observation of entropy will use time interval 't' 
between observances of 'Intercepted Packet' or Tagged Cat 
Presentations.  This is similar in principle to the current 
methodology used in numerous programs with user input from 
keyboards.
[Static Activity in cat tree.]
Methodology:
[Packets move in tubes, not dumptrucks.]
IKEA toy department - item "SPEJA" provides an enticing 
environment for cats.  Taking advantage of the long RFID reader 
range, readers can be mounted at either end of each tube, with 
tubes running between typical cat destinations.
Methodology:
Considerations:  Security
-802.11 - 'nuff said.  Obviously the project must balance the 
use of this technology with the issues inherent in clock 
variances among several distinct electronic assemblies with 
autonomous data storage, and the inherent cost (and potential 
Tempest vulnerability) of cabling the distinct assemblies 
together using 802.3.  
- In each of the Ethernet cases, the obvious advantage in clock 
synchronization is the use of NTP, but this itself is 
potentially a liability, as special care must be taken to 
secure the network against the introduction of spurious NTP 
messages.  Also, the use of crypto on the wire (or lack of 
wire) will necessarily introduce latency, although this may or 
may not prove significant.
Methodology:
Considerations:  Security (continued)
-Read-only RFID chips, such as the EM4102, are subject to 
spoofing or replay attacks.
-Read-Write RFID chips are subject to additional types of 
attack: www.rfidvirus.org
-RFID - range can be an issue.  Proximity limits mean 
designs must incorporate architectural features designed to 
assure proper distance and orientation of tag with reader.
Methodology:
Considerations:  Security (continued)
-Potential vectors of observation:
--Frequency analysis against vulnerable points - food dish, water 
bowl, litter box
--Is the Veterinarian a confederate of the Observer?
--Is it possible for the Observer to introduce non-random data via 
such means as releasing birds near a window?
--Do Felines engage in stereotopy?  (Yes. See Appendix for 
references)
Methodology:
Considerations:  Security (continued)
-Potential factors influencing randomness:
--Catnip
--Heisenberg Effect - does the cat know she's being 
observed?
--Heisenberg Effect - given the difficulty of conducting 
double-blind research in this area, will the people 
involved affect the outcome by their own behaviors?  Does 
this affect the randomness of the data?  Further 
experimentation is necessary.
--Play-time - cats will often invent hallucinatory prey 
creatures ("invisible energy monsters") in the absence of 
actual play with people or other cats.  See also - 
stereotopy.
--Increasingly sedentary behavior with age, diet, or 
other factors

Considerations:  Security (continued)
-Potential factors influencing randomness:
[Sloth is a factor.]

their lord's honor.  Some became mercenaries, some

Two sold their children into slavery. All became RONIN."
