User: I want my Python script to copy files on Vista. When I run it from a normal cmd.exe window, no errors are generated, yet the files are NOT copied. If I run cmd.exe "as administator" and then run my script, it works fine.
This makes sense since User Account Control (UAC) normally prevents many file system actions.
Is there a way I can, from within a Python script, invoke a UAC elevation request (those dialogs that say something like "such and such app needs admin access, is this OK?")
If that's not possible, is there a way my script can at least detect that it is not elevated so it can fail gracefully?
Assistant: You can make a shortcut somewhere and as the target use:
python yourscript.py
then under properties and advanced select run as administrator. 
When the user executes the shortcut it will ask them to elevate the application.
