User: I'm using Python, for what it's worth, but will accept answers in any applicable language.
I've tried writing to /proc/$pid/cmdline, but that's a readonly file.
I've tried assigning a new string to sys.argv[0], but that has no perceptible impact.
Are there any other possibilities?  My program is executing processes via os.system (equivalent to system(3)) so a general, *NIX-based solution using an additional spawning process would be fine.
Assistant: Writing to *argv will change it, but you'll need to do that from C or the like; I don't think Python is going to readily give you access to that memory directly.
I'd also recommend just leaving it alone.
