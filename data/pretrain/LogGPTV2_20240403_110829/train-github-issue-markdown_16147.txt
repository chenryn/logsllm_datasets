**Current behavior**
An error inside a template is swallowed if the template was rendered as a
response to a promise resolution.
In other cases the same exception is properly logged. Exception in .then() is
OK. Exception in template that was not rendered in response to a promise is OK
**Expected behavior**
The exception should either be passed to the .catch-function or logged.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
http://plnkr.co/edit/ilqlcUUnrRpvFEFuzQc6?p=preview&open=app%2Fapp.component.ts
Run the plunkr and see that there is no exeption.
Comment out Mark2 and put back in Mark1 or Mark3 and see that the error is
handled properly.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
When the error inside templates silently fails It makes it much harder for me
to figure out why the template does not finish rendering.
  * **Angular version:** 4.0.0
  * **Browser:** Chrome, bot probably all.
