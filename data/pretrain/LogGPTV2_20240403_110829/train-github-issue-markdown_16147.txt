**Current Behavior**
When an error occurs within a template that is rendered in response to a promise resolution, the error is silently swallowed and not logged. In contrast, if the same error occurs in a template that was not rendered as a result of a promise, it is properly logged. Additionally, exceptions occurring in `.then()` blocks are also correctly handled.

**Expected Behavior**
The exception should either be passed to the `.catch` function or logged, ensuring that all errors are appropriately reported, regardless of the context in which they occur.

**Steps to Reproduce the Issue**
1. Visit the following Plunker: [http://plnkr.co/edit/ilqlcUUnrRpvFEFuzQc6?p=preview&open=app%2Fapp.component.ts](http://plnkr.co/edit/ilqlcUUnrRpvFEFuzQc6?p=preview&open=app%2Fapp.component.ts)
2. Run the Plunker and observe that no exception is logged.
3. Comment out `Mark2` and uncomment `Mark1` or `Mark3`.
4. Observe that the error is now properly handled and logged.

**Motivation for Changing the Behavior**
When errors within templates are silently ignored, it significantly complicates the debugging process, making it much more difficult to determine why a template fails to render correctly.

**Environment Details**
- **Angular Version:** 4.0.0
- **Browser:** Chrome (but likely affects all browsers)
