of the number of BGP preﬁxes an rANS cluster spans,
and vice versa. About 10% of the BGP preﬁx clusters
can be further divided into smaller clusters by consid-
ering rANS information. When applying naming clus-
ters to rANS clusters, we obtain 106,356 DNS clusters
which is slightly more than BGP preﬁx clusters.

behavior is within the same cluster (How likely that
some IPs send spam while others send legitimate emails
within the same cluster) and how they differ between
different types of clusters. We can see that in the ﬁg-
ure, the spam ratio distribution of BGP preﬁx clusters
is closer to that of IP than of DNS clusters. BGP pre-
ﬁx and IP-based clusters both have about 0.4% of cases
with 0 spam ratio. The curve shapes for BGP preﬁx clus-
ters and DNS clusters are similar, but their initial values
differ by more than 9%. In particular, more than 17%
DNS clusters have spam ratio of 0. This suggests that
BGP preﬁx clusters can effectively identify clusters with
spamming IP addresses while DNS is useful for uncov-
ering legitimate servers. This is explained by the obser-
vation shown later in §5.6 that BGP preﬁx cluster more
closely reﬂects dynamic IP ranges where a signiﬁcant
amount of spam comes from [29].
Next, we study the effectiveness of using cluster’s
spamming behavior to classify good and bad IPs. The
idea is that we deﬁne a threshold of spam ratio for de-
ciding whether a particular cluster is good or bad.
If
the spam ratio exceeds the threshold, we consider any
IP address within the cluster as bad IP. We pick one day
as testing and the remaining earlier days of data as train-
ing data, changing the testing data over 30 days from
Jun 10th to Jul 9th, 2009. We plot the graph by adjust-
ing the threshold from 0.8 to 1.0 at the granularity of
0.01, averaging across different testing days in Figure 8.
We can observe that DNS clusters have higher accura-
cies compared with BGP preﬁx clusters since they can
further divide an administrative domain into potentially
good IPs and bad ones based on the naming pattern.

2,327,932 (99.5%)
12,258 (0.5%)
5.5 Cluster persistence
Behavior of clusters clearly is more persistent than
that of individual IPs due to longer history. Most IPs
appear only for a day or two, but 80% of the clusters
appear in at least 8 days out of the 7-month duration
of our study. The cluster behavior also shows consis-
tency as the average standard deviation of spam ratio
across all clusters over the 7-month duration is as low
as 0.09 (consistent with the result by Venkataraman et
al. [28]). This suggests that whenever a cluster is iden-
tiﬁed as good or bad, it remains so for a relatively long
time period. Cluster-based analysis is therefore more ef-
fective for spam ﬁltering compared to purely IP-based
approaches. In Figure 9, we show an example of how
different IPs appear across time in one of the largest pre-
ﬁx, which belongs to a large ISP in India. Interestingly,
in this case, all IPs are sending purely spam from this
preﬁx, showing persistent spamming behavior within a
cluster.

Figure 10. Training time vs. FP and FN
In Figure 10, with the spam ratio threshold set to
0.98, we can see that the false positive and false nega-
tive rate of both BGP preﬁx clusters and DNS clusters
decrease with increased training time. The result fur-
ther suggests that with sufﬁcient training time, we can
classify new IPs based on their cluster history with high
accuracy. Longer training time leads to more stable re-
sults which in turn supports persistent spamming behav-
ior of clusters. Note that we do not observe clusters com-
pletely disappear during our study, i.e., all IP addresses
within a cluster stop sending emails at some point, de-
spite a possible conjecture that spamming botnets may
create dynamic time-based behavior of the clusters (e.g.,
rDNS names changed and thus old clusters based on
DNS information may become obsolete). We plan to
investigate this further, as our clustering approach opens
new potential opportunities for detecting botnets.
5.6 Correlation with dynamic IPs
Given that past studies have shown that spam of-
ten originates from dynamic IPs, we correlate the clus-
ter data with dynamic IP ranges based on UDMap [29]
which is the latest known, accurate source for such data.
The dynamic IP ranges are gathered by analyzing the
Hotmail user login traces [29]. We found that out of
the 2,737,006 IP addresses, 786,460 are identiﬁed as
dynamic with each IP assigned to a unique dynamic
IP range ID. Surprisingly, we observe that dynamic IPs
only contribute to 22.1% of the total spam as shown in
Table 5. This deviates from the ﬁnding in UDMap [29]
that shows dynamic IPs contribute to 42.2% of the total
spam. Two possible reasons can explain this difference:
(1) Our vantage point captures different spamming be-
havior from what was seen in Hotmail. (2) Spammers
are shifting to using static IP addresses for sending spam
to improve spam delivery, possibly because of the more
prevalent blocking of direct connection to port 25 from
dynamic IPs and the inclusion of dynamic IP ranges by
many popular blacklists [9, 7].
We exclude preﬁxes containing at least one static IP
address based on UDMap classiﬁcation results, thus ob-
taining 4325 BGP preﬁxes that contain purely dynamic
IPs. In contrast, there are only 254 rANS clusters con-
taining purely dynamic IP addresses. Further, by cor-
relating them with the dynamic IP range ID produced
by UDMap (each dynamic IP range is assigned a unique
ID), we found that these BGP preﬁxes covers 9785 dy-
namic IP range ID (7% of all the ranges) while rANS
only covers 406 dynamic IP ranges (0.5%). Further
analysis reveals that out of these 4317 BGP preﬁxes,
64% of the BGP preﬁxes match exactly with one dy-
namic IP range. 34% of them strictly contains more
than one dynamic IP range. The remaining 2% BGP pre-
ﬁxes are either a strict subset of one dynamic IP range
or overlap with more than one dynamic IP range (Those
