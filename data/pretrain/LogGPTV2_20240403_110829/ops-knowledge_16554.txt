User: How can I check the filesystem usage (eg disk space, number of files, etc.) on the server?
Assistant: 1. Use the df command: The df command can be used to display the usage of the file system, including information such as disk space, available space, and used space. The df command can be run using the following command: ``` df -h ``` The -h option displays disk space in a human readable format. 2. Use the du command: The du command can be used to display the disk space usage of a specific directory or file. You can use the following command to run the du command: ``` du -sh /path/to/directory ``` -s option means To show only overall disk usage, the -h option displays disk space in a human-readable format. 3. Use the ls command: The ls command can be used to display the number and size of files in a specific directory or file. You can use the following command to run the ls command: ``` ls -l /path/to/directory | wc -l ``` The | symbol allows the use of the wc command to count the number of files, and the -l option is used to list detailed information about the file, including file size and other information.
