User: I need some help. Im trying to run Python IDLE on my computer but I get the following error: 

IDLE can't bind to a TCP/IP port, which is necessary to communicate with its Python execution server. This might be because no networking is installed on this computer. Run IDLE with the -n command line switch to start without a subprocess and refer Help/IDLE Help 'Running without a subprocess' for further details.   

My networking card just fried a couple days ago so I think this might be the problem, I dont know. I also tried refer to IDLE Help but I couldn't understand a thing.
Is there anyway I can get by this problem. I need this program operational for my programming class' a least until my new computer arrives.
Assistant: Assumptions:
  You're running on Windows and installed the basic python for windows (which includes idle) and probably stuck with the defaults (so you should have python in c:\python35)
Related assumptions: Windows doesn't have an out of the box loopback interface and trying to enable one is going to be more painful than working around it.
Recommendations:

You might want to try to sneakernet (i.e. download on a friend's computer to a USB stick and then copy over) pycharm or another IDE, but I don't know if they won't have the same problem
If that doesn't work, you should be able to (as an interim step while you wait for a new computer):

Use Idle (with the -n flag) to edit your python program(s) [because trying to edit python programs in Wordpad is cruel], save your program as myprogram.py
Open up cmd (dos prompt), cd to your save directory, do c:\python35\python.exe myprogram.py
Repeat 1+2 as needed
