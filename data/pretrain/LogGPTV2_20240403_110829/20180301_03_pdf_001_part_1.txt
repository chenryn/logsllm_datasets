Abstract
We introducea new sublinearspace data structure—theCount-Min Sketch— for summa-
rizing data streams. Our sketch allows fundamentalqueries in data stream summarization
suchaspoint,range,andinnerproductqueriestobeapproximatelyansweredveryquickly;
in addition, it can be applied to solve several important problems in data streams such as
findingquantiles,frequentitems,etc.ThetimeandspaceboundsweshowforusingtheCM
sketch to solve these problemssignificantlyimprove thosepreviously known —typically

This setup is the data stream scenario that has emerged recently. Algorithms for computing func-
tions within the data stream context need to satisfy the following desiderata. First, the space used
by the algorithm should be small, atmost poly-logarithmic in n, the space required to represent a

In recent years, several different sketches have been proposed in the data stream context that al-
low a number of simple aggregation functions to be approximated. Quantities for which efficient
sketches have been designed include the L and L norms of vectors [2,14,23], the number of
1 2
distinct items in a sequence (ie number of non-zero entries in a(t)) [15,18,6], join and self-join
sizes of relations (representable as inner-products of vectors a(t);b(t)) [2,1], item and range sum
queries [20,5]. These sketches are of interest not simply because they can be used to directly ap-

Many applications that use sketches to compute queries of interest—suchas monitoring database
contents,analyzingIPtraffic seeninanetworklink—guaranteethatcountswillneverbenegative.
However, the general case occurs in important scenarios too, for example in distributed settings
whereoneconsidersthe subtractionofonevectorfrom another,say.
At any time t, a query calls for computing certain functions of interest on a(t). We focus on ap-

Thesequeriesarerelated:arangequeryisasumofpointqueries;bothpointandrangequeriesare
specific inner product queries. However, in terms of approximations to these queries, results will
vary. These are the queries that are fundamental to many applications in data stream algorithms,
andhavebeenextensivelystudied.Inaddition,theyareofinterestinnon-datastreamcontext.For
example,indatabases,thepointandrangequeriesareofinterestinsummarizingthedatadistribu-
tionapproximately;andinner-productqueriesallowapproximationofjoinsizeofrelations.Fuller
discussionoftheseaspectscanbefound in[16,28].
We will also study use of these queries to compute more complex functions on data streams. As
examples, we will focus on the two following problems. Recall that jjajj = n ja (t)j; more
