User:  How to manage Git branches, including creating, merging, deleting branches, etc.?
Assistant: 1. Create a branch: Use the command `git branch <branch_name>` to create a new branch. For example, if you want to create a new branch called "feature", you can use the command `git branch feature`. 2. Switch branch: Use the command `git checkout <branch_name>` to switch to the specified branch. For example, to switch to the branch named "feature", you would use the command `git checkout feature`. 3. Create a branch and switch to a branch: Use the command `git checkout -b <branch_name>` to create and switch to a new branch. For example, if you want to create and switch to a new branch called "develop", you can use the command `git checkout -b develop`. 4. View branches: Use the command `git branch` to view all branches in the current library. The current branch is marked with an asterisk. For example, use the command `git branch` to view all branches and their status in the current repository. 5. Merge branch: Use the command `git merge <branch_name>` to merge the specified branch into the current branch. For example, if you want to merge the branch named "feature" into the current branch, you can use the command `git merge feature`. 6. Delete branch: Use the command `git branch -d <branch_name>` to delete the specified branch. For example, to delete the branch named "feature", you can use the command `git branch -d feature`. It should be noted that only the branch that merged the branch can be deleted. 7. Forcibly delete the branch: Use the command `git branch -D <branch_name>` to forcibly delete the specified branch. This command will skip the step of checking whether the branch has been merged and delete it directly. For example, to forcefully delete the branch named "develop", use the command `git branch -D develop`.
