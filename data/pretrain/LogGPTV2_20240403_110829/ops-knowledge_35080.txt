User: I'm working on a Python project that is required some file transferring. One side of the connection is highly available ( REHL 6 ) and always online. But the other side is going on and off ( Windows 7 ) and the connection period is not guaranteed. The files are transporting on both directions and sizes are between 10MB to 2GB.
Is it possible to resume the file transferring with paramiko instead of transferring the entire file from the beginning. 
I would like to use rSync but one side is windows and I would like to avoid cwRsync and DeltaCopy
Assistant: Paramiko doesn't offer an out of the box 'resume' function however, Syncrify, DeltaCopy's big successor has a retry built in and if the backup goes down the server waits up to six hours for a reconnect. Pretty trusty, easy to use and data diff by default.
