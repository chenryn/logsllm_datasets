User: I am going to develop some functionality using python and I need to setup pycharm but it depends on some dependencies like open JDK of oracle.
How can setup these two.
Assistant: When you have downloaded a package from Oracle site, unpack it and copy its contents into for example /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_51/.
Then, type following commands:
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_51/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_51/bin/javac" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_51/bin/javaws" 1
and in the end:
sudo update-alternatives --config java
and choose the the number of your Oracle Java installation.
