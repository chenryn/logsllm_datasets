User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I enable logging for requests going through mod proxy Is there a way to log requests going through mod proxy? I need a way to debug my configuration, because I don't seem to be getting where I should be. I need the following information:


headers of incoming requests
what is being sent to the proxy target


Maybe a related question: is there a way to strip some headers? I tried the following:

ProxyPass         /proxy/other http://not.under.my.control/
&lt;Location /proxy/other&gt;
   ProxyPassReverse /
   RequestHeader unset Authorization
&lt;/Location&gt;


I don't really know whether this is ok, because I don't see anything.

Assistant: I used dumpio. I put the following in /etc/httpd/conf.d/dumpio.conf:

LoadModule dumpio_module modules/mod_dumpio.so

DumpIOInput On
DumpIOOutput On
DumpIOLogLevel debug

LogLevel debug


An often forgotten piece is setting the LogLevel to debug. Without it, you won't actually see any DumpIO output.

The log output is written to the error log for the virtual host and/or the server.
