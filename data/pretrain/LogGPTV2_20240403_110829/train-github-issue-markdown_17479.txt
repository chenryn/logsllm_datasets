Problem: the following codes just hang and never returns
     clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)
     pods, err := clientset.Core().Pods("").List(api.ListOptions{Watch:true})
while codes like:
    watch, err := clientset.Core().Pods("").Watch(api.ListOptions{})
work as expected.  
IMHO, the first use is kind of misleading.
