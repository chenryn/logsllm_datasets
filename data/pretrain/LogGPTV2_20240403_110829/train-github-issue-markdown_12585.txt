    go version:

    the code:
    https://gist.github.com/mitchellh/3883097d9d57fccbfb88
    (the code actually works fine on play.golang.org, I'm not sure what changed in Go 1.2
    but on 1.2 this panics)
    The panic looks like this. If you look, the line number of `net.(*TCPConn).Close` is on
    line 1 in dial.go. Is this working as intended? It made debugging this trickier.
    panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
