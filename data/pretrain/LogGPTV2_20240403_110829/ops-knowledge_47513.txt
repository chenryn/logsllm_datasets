User: I am new to celery.I know how to install and run one server but I need to distribute the task to multiple machines.
My project uses celery to assign user requests passing to a web framework to different machines and then returns the result.
I read the documentation but there it doesn't mention how to set up multiple machines.
What am I missing?
Assistant: The way I deployed it is like this:

clone your django project on a heroku instance (this will run the frontend)
add RabitMQ as an add on and configure it 
clone your django project into another heroku instance (call it like worker) where you will run the celery tasks
