Currently `ContentNegotiatingViewResolver` acts lenient as it returns `null`
when it can not resolve any view to indicate that further `ViewResolvers`
configured shall step in and try to resolve the view.
In cases when `ContentNegotiatingViewResolver` is the only resolver
configured, not resolving the view should be answered with a `406 Not
Acceptable` status code. A quick hack I did was to add a property `beStrict`
to `CNVR` an implement an inner class to return the appropriate statuscode.
See applied patch.
This solves the problem at a first glance but I think it would be more clean
to prevent processing of the request entirely if no valid accept header was
set by using the algorithm `getmediaTypes(..)` in `CNVR`. Currently this
method is not public, but I could imagine a `HandlerInterceptor`
implementation that gets a reference to the `CNVR` injected and call to
`getMediaType(..)` to decide whether to process the request at all.
