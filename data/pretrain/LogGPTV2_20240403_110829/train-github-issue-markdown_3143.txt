After compiling from source, the generated `.desktop` file contains an incorrect binary location. Specifically, it points to `.../share/atom/atom` instead of the correct location, which should be `.../bin/atom`.

Additionally, the installation share folder does not include an icon file, causing the `.desktop` file to reference an invalid icon destination. As a result, the application icon is not displayed correctly.
