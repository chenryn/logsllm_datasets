User: Is there anyway of forcing the GAE dev server to keep full text search indexes after restart? I am finding that the index is lost whenever the dev server is restarted.
I am already using a static datastore path when I launch the dev server (the --datastore_path option).
Assistant: This functionality was added a few releases ago (in either 1.7.1 or 1.7.2, I think). If you're using an SDK from the last few months it should be working. You can try explicitly setting the --search_indexes_path flag on dev_appserver.py; it's possible that the default location (/tmp/) isn't writable. Could you post the first few lines of the logs from when you start dev_appserver?
