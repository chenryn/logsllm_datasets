## Playbook: Ransomware
**Investigate, remediate (contain, eradicate), and communicate in parallel! Containment is critical in ransomware incidents, prioritize accordingly.**
Assign steps to individuals or teams to work concurrently, when possible; this playbook is not purely sequential. Use your best judgment.
### Investigate
`TODO: Expand investigation steps, including key questions and strategies, for ransomware.`
1. **Determine the type** of ransomware (_i.e.,_ what is the family, variant, or flavor?)[[1]](#ransomware-playbook-ref-1)
    1. Find any related messages.  Check:
        * graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for the malware itself
        * text or html files, sometimes opened automatically after encryption
        * image files, often as wallpaper on infected systems
        * contact emails in encrypted file extensions
        * pop-ups after trying to open an encrypted file
        * voice messages
    1. Analyze the messages looking for clues to the ransomware type:
        * ransomware name
        * language, structure, phrases, artwork
        * contact email
        * format of the user id
        * ransom demand specifics (_e.g._, digital currency, gift cards)
        * payment address in case of digital currency
        * support chat or support page
    1. Analyze affected and/or new files.  Check:
        * file renaming scheme of encrypted files including extension (_e.g._, `.crypt`, `.cry`, `.locked`) and base name
        * file corruption vs encryption
        * targeted file types and locations
        * owning user/group of affected files
        * icon for encrypted files
        * file markers
        * existence of file listings, key files or other data files
    1. Analyze affected software or system types.  Some ransomware variants only affect certain tools (_e.g._, [databases](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mongodb-apocalypse-professional-ransomware-group-gets-involved-infections-reach-28k-servers/)) or platforms (_e.g._, [NAS products](https://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=88716))
    1. Upload indicators to automated categorization services like [Crypto Sheriff](https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.php), [ID Ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/), or similar.
1. **Determine the scope:**
    1. Which systems are affected? `TODO: Specify tool(s) and procedure`
        * Scan for concrete indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as files/hashes, processes, network connections, etc.  Use [endpoint protection/EDR](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [endpoint telemetry](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [system logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), etc.
        * Check similar systems for infection (_e.g._, similar users, groups, data, tools, department,configuration, patch status): check [IAM tools](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [permissions management tools](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [directory services](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), _etc._
        * Find external command and control (C2), if present, and find other systems connecting to it: check [firewall or IDS logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [system logs/EDR](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [DNS logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [netflow or router logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), _etc._
    1. What data is affected? (_e.g._, file types, department or group, affected software) `TODO: Specify tool(s) and procedure`
        * Find anomalous changes to file metadata such as mass changes to creation or modification times.  Check [file metadata search tools](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource)
        * Find changes to normally-stable or critical data files.  Check [file integrity monitoring](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource) tools
1. **Assess the impact** to prioritize and motivate resources
    1. Assess functional impact: impact to business or mission.
        * How much money is lost or at risk?
        * How many (and which) missions are degraded or at risk?
    1. Assess information impact: impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
        * How critical is the data to the business/mission?
        * How sensitive is the data? (_e.g._, trade secrets)
        * What is the regulatory status of data (_e.g._, PII, PHI)
1. **Find the infection vector.**  Check the tactics captured in the [Initial Access tactic](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/) of MITRE ATT&CK[[4]](#ransomware-playbook-ref-4).  Common specifics and data sources include:
    * email attachment: check [email logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [email security appliances and services](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [e-discovery tools](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), _etc._
    * insecure remote desktop protocol (RDP): check [vulnerability scanning results](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [firewall configurations](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), _etc._
    * self-propagation (worm or virus) (check [host telemetry/EDR](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [system logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [forensic analysis](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), _etc._)
    * infection via removable drives (worm or virus)
    * delivered by other malware or attacker tool: expand investigation to include additional attacker tools or malware
### Remediate
* **Plan remediation events** where these steps are launched together (or in coordinated fashion), with appropriate teams ready to respond to any disruption.
* **Consider the timing and tradeoffs** of remediation actions: your response has consequences.
#### Contain
`TODO: Customize containment steps, tactical and strategic, for ransomware.`
`TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below.`
**In ransomware situations, containment is critical.  Inform containment measures with facts from the investigation.  Prioritize quarantines and other containment measures higher than during a typical response.**
Quarantines (logical, physical, or both) prevent spread _from_ infected systems and prevent spread _to_ critical systems and data. Quarantines should be comprehensive: include cloud/SaaS access, single-sign-on, system access such as to ERP or other business tools, _etc._
* Quarantine infected systems
* Quarantine affected users and groups.
* Quarantine file shares (not just known-infected shares; protect uninfected shares too)
* Quarantine shared databases (not just known-infected servers; protect uninfected databases too)
* Quarantine backups, if not already secured
* Block command and control domains and addresses
* Remove vector emails from inboxes
* Confirm endpoint protection (AV, NGAV, EDR, _etc._) is up-to-date and enabled on all systems.
* Confirm patches are deployed on all systems (prioritizing targeted systems, OSes, software, _etc._).
* Deploy custom signatures to endpoint protection and network security tools based on discovered IOCs
`TODO: Consider automating containment measures using orchestration tools.`
#### Eradicate
`TODO: Customize eradication steps, tactical and strategic, for ransomware.`
`TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below.`
* Rebuild infected systems from known-good media
* Restore from known-clean backups
* Confirm endpoint protection (AV, NGAV, EDR, _etc._) is up-to-date and enabled on all systems.
* Confirm patches are deployed on all systems (prioritizing targeted systems, OSes, software, _etc._).
* Deploy custom signatures to endpoint protection and network security tools based on discovered IOCs
* **Watch for re-infection:** consider increased priority for alarms/alerts related to this incident.
